IT was mostly during my first two years on the farm that things happened . Unfamiliarity sharpened events into adventure . Later on the unusual gradually flattened into matter of course . For this reason I am glad that I looked over my wild-hog claim during the first year of possession , a time when I fed on explorer 's elixir , and knew not plain bread and meat . I can still see Sam , a clear-cut figure , swinging from an overhead bough which he had grasped just in time to save himself from the plunging , foam-scattering boar that in another second would have had his life . But the beginning of the day was calm enough . For some time I had heard talk of my claim as a fund-producing property which , if looked after as it should be , would enable me to buy out the County Bank as soon as I chose . My predecessor had imported a few Berkshires and Poland Chinas to mix with the wild breed , and the result , Len assured me , was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without unfitting the hogs for hardy life on the ridges . Acorns were abundant ; sprouting chestnuts could be uprooted until late in the spring . By taking the hogs in midwinter , before the mast began to grow scant , one could find them fairly fat , and two or three weeks in the pen , with plenty of corn to crunch , I would make the meat sweet and marketable . Whenever things looked expensively blue on the farm there was always someone to remind me cheerfully of my wild hogs that could be fotched in an ' cashed quick as nothin ' . ' We were having some bright , windless days in January , and Len said to me wistfully , Ai n't this the hoghuntin ' time , though ? ' I was getting close to the wall as to ways and means , so I answered , ' Very well , Len . Tell Sam about it and get ready for a round-up to-morrow . ' He was delighted . I jest been achin ' to git into the woods , ' he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Course you know what yer mark is , Mis ' Dolly ? ' I did n't , and he apologized for my ignorance in a matter so vital . ' A woman kai n't be expected to know ever'thing ' bout the hog business . Yer mark is an undercrap in the right year an ' two main smart slits in the top o ' the left . Ag Snead ' s got a mark nearly like yorn , only they ' s a slit in the right an ' a crap too . It 's a top slit , an ' ever ' hog that ' s got the top o ' his year torn off ol ' Ag drives in fer his'n . An ' they ' s mainly yore , Mis ' Dolly . ' But how do they get their ears torn off ? ' Dogs . We have to ketch ' em with a dog , an ' he gits ' em by the year . Sometimes a blame hog ' 11 leave part of his year with the dog an ' go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs onto yore mark , hopin ' to tear a year off an ' claim the hog , an ' I would n't put it past him . ' ' That 's rascality , Len , and Mr. Snead is a deacon . ' ' Law , when a man goes hog-huntin ' he puts his ' ligion in the cupboard , so it wo n't git hurt while he 's out . ' ' Those hogs are mine . I 'm going to have a talk with neighbor Snead . ' Len was startled . ' Lord-a-mercy ! This here 's a country where you kai n't call a man a hog-thief an ' git home by sundown . ' ' I wo n't call him a thief . ' ' No , I reckon you ' 11 jest inquire of he 's got any o ' yore hogs in his pen . ' Noting that I duly crumpled , he became protective as usual . ' You see , Mis ' Dolly , they ai n't any way to ' proach a man on sech a subject , less'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' II meet at Sam 's , ' he told me. ' round about ' fore good daylight . There ' 11 be pap an ' my Ben , an ' we ' 11 take Burl ' cause he 's got a big dog . ' Burl was a cousin of Coretta 's , staying at Sam 's and trying , with fluctuating success , to court Len 's oldest girl . ' A good hog-hunt , ' said Len , ' will show of he 's any account , him an ' that clog o ' hisn . ' I managed to reach Sam 's the next morning while the smoky lamp was still burning on the kitchen table . As I approached I heard voices , zestful and happy , but when I appeared in the door there was surprise , then a troubled silence . ' You need n't been afeard I would n't git ' cm off early , ' said Coretta . ' I been up sence three o'clock , an ' Len an ' Ben come at four . We 'd done breakfast , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'm not hurrying you . I was only afraid that I would n't be in time myself . ' You ' re not going ? ' all questioned at once , and plunged into talk of the cliffs that I would tumble over , the thickets I could n't crawl through , and the ' straight-ups ' I could n't climb . I did not doubt their concern for me , but felt that more was behind their opposition than desire for my safety . In some subterranean way they knew that crafty hints had reached me of their having now and then spirited hogs to neighborly markets , forgetting to share the proceeds with the owner ; they knew too , by the same invisible channels , that the tainting insinuations had been indignantly discouraged ; yet they suspected me of wanting to keep on their track . After getting up at an heroic hour to prove my full comradeship , it was depressing to run against suspicion , as cold in my confident face as the frosty air of the dawn . But I innocently urged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of equal value , and I would share all risks . After some minutes of talk ? genuine even as it veiled the core of discussion ? the springs of good humor began to flow , doubt was put to cover , and we were on the road . Serena was with us . She had come with Len to the meet , and I had heard him insisting on her accompanying me . ' You wo n't have to go fur , ' he said . ' She ' 11 turn back ' fore we git to Broke Yoke Gap . ' Granpap also was of the party . ' He kai n't run , ' said Len , ' but he 'll he'p us more ' n you 'd think . He caught a big feller last year all by hisse'f , ' cept what little ol ' Bub could do . ' ' All right , granpap , ' I said , feeling gay and generous as the sun began to warm our mountain , ' you can have all you catch to-day . I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ? no thanks . Everybody looked straight into the woods , ostensibly concerned with nothing but sighting a hog ; and I knew thereby that my words had been taken seriously . ' We ought to git Red Granny today , ' said Sam , examining the ground where the smoking leaves had been stirred . ' Here 's her consarned ol ' broke-toed track . An ' here 's a lot o ' littler tracks . She 's been in an ' tolled out some more o ' our shotes . I bet if we hurried up we 'd come right on her . ' Let 's hurry then , ' I urged ; for I knew about the old sow called Red Granny , that for three years had proved uncapturable . She kept her inaccessible house on the side of a rough mountain , making her way to it through a great pile of rock by a passage yet undiscovered . Though a good breeder , filling the woods with sandy-haired pigs , she also seemed able to teach them the secret of escape . Bub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run a red pig unless it was on his own side of the mountain . Tai n't no use to trail Red Granny , ' said Len . ' 01 ' Bub leads the dogs , an ' he wo n't run that-a-way . I put him on her trail once an ' he was out all night . When he come in next day he was too ' shamed to look at me . ' Well , let 's get somewhere , ' I said , feeling the cold in spite of the sun . Then I found I had made a mistake . The first part of hog-hunting is deliberation . There was a long discussion as to the most fruitful direction . Finally little Ross , who had followed Serena , said , ' Let 's go to the sow 's oak , ' and to my amazement everybody agreed . ' I bet that spotted sow is there with some little pigs , an ' poppie promised me one , ' said Ross . The sow 's oak was a giant tree with a large hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a litter . For years it had been a favorite bedding . place . To find it we had to descend into a cove where there was a clear spring . All stopped for water , though everybody had taken a drink just before leaving Sam 's . The High . lander can go without a meal or two with no inconvenience , but he drinks water in season and out of season . After leaving the spring we passed around the curving side of a hill and came in sight of the tree . Sst ! ' said Sam . ' I see her . She 's in there , an ' she 's got pigs . Do n't crowd her now . Keep the dogs back . We do n't want her to git tore , an ' her a-sucklin ' pigs . Y'all stand out here in a circle like , so she kai n't git through if she runs , and I 'll ease up behind the tree . When ye see me bounce ' round to the front to grab her leg , ever'body an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide circuit and came up behind the tree , but before he reached it Burl 's dog , Bugle , who was new at the game , gave a yelp and the sou ' sprang'out . About a dozen tiny pigs , black-spotted and with delicate pink noses , followed her . All three of the dogs rushed forward and yapped in her face . She bristled to fight , then turned and dashed in the opposite direction , flashing by Sam and leaving him to look foolish , with a knotted rope in his hands . The dogs flew after the sow and the men followed the dogs , Little Ross began to scramble after the terrified , squealing pigs . Go after the one with the black spot on its year , ' said Serena . ' It 's the purtiest . ' Ross tumbled after the one she pointed out and secured it . Serena took it into her apron . By that time not a pig was to be seen or heard . They were all under the leaves , behind logs , anywhere they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the cry of the dogs and shouts of the men . Then the yelping ceased and we heard the wild squeals of the captive . When we reached the spot the men were looking down on the struggling sow . She was tied by one hind leg , and the other end of the rope was made fast to a young tree . She ' 11 keep all right , ' said granpap , examining the knots critically . ' Reckon anybody ' 11 find her here ' fore we git back ? The woods air full o ' hunters . ' ' Hunters and stealers , ' said Len indignantly . ' But we kai n't he'p it . We got to go on . ' ' She 'll drive in easy , ' said Serena . ' It 's that sow you brought in last year , an ' I gentled her with slop fer a month . ' She put the little pig clown by his mother , who became very still as he lined a nudging nose to her . I wanted io return and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They 'll find the sow of she 'll squeal loud enough , ' said Sam . ' They wo n't run fur anyhow , an ' we 'll look ' em out as we go home . ' The men had discovered some signs which they were sure would lead to a use bunch of shotes . ' An ' shotes pay , ' they said . Anybody 'll buy a shote . ' The signs ' took us by a very rough way through a damp hollow . Serena declared it was so ' blustery ' she could n't stand it , and persuaded me to turn up the slope and walk along the ridge , leaving the men to push their way below . ' They always scour that holler , ' she said , ' but they 've never brought a pig out of it . ' In half an hour the men came up defeated . Some pigs had been found , but they proved to be in Ag Snead 's mark . ' I 'll tell ye what let 's do , ' said Len @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that big b'ar hog that 's tuskin ' our genu ties ever ' time they go to the woods . ' ' I 'm afraid o ' that feller , ' said young Ben . ' I seen him once . He suits me where he is . ' Let 's go fer him , ' said Burl . ' That sounds like a hunt . ' I 'm ready , ' said Sam . ' That feller ' s too mean to let live . I 've had to sew up two shotes this week that come in all cut up . ' We were moving slowly along the ridge , and little Ross , who had been running ahead , came flying back to say that he had found a hog sound asleep . We rushed forward and came upon a fine sow lying dead . Len pointed to a bullet hole in her forehead . Is it ours ? ' I asked , for my mind was set on revenue and this was a dismal beginning . So far we had to our credit only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own accord when food grew scarce ? and this . Len flicked the exposed ear of the sow . ' You see the undercrap , ' he said . Then he pulled the other ear from under her head . ' An ' there 's the two slits . It 's a ten-dollar bill you got layin ' there . ' ' Ay , ' said Sam , ' she 's worth ten dollars more yisterday than to-day . ' Yisterday ! ' said Len . ' She 's shot early this mornin ' . She ai n't froze yit , an ' last night would ' a ' froze fire . Whoever shot her is in the woods now , an ' he better not come shammuckin ' where I can see him . I 'd have my say . ' You ai n't goin ' to talk into a gun , Len , ' said Serena . ' Wha 'd you promise me about this hog business ? ' Shucks , Reenie , I ai n't broke no promise yit . ' Y'ai n't goin ' to nuther. 01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' to chance comin ' on you layin ' in the woods like this here sow ? ' Why , ' I asked , at last getting in my burning question , did they shoot the poor thing and leave her here ? ' Oh , she looked slick an ' fine a hundred yards off , but when they shot her an ' come up close they seen she was goin ' to litter an ' was n't fit fer meat . ' What about a stomach that can eat a hog right off the mast ? ' said Sam . ' Ag Snead ai n't more'n ha'f human anyway . ' " Twa' n't Ag , ' said granpap . ' It ' ud take two men to git this hog in home , an ' ol ' Ag is secrety . He would n't want a partner in this kind o ' work . It 's the Copp boys more ' n likely . ' There ' s ol ' Aggervation now , ' called Ben . We looked ahead and saw a man approaching . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown , walked beside him . That 's his nephew , Ted Shoals , ' said Len . " Course they done it ! Now watch Ag , the ol ' devil ! You 'd think he was jest from prayer-meetin ' . ' Howdy , folks , ' Snead called to us . He was about seventy , with cool , pink cheeks , and white hair that still kept a youthful ripple . His eyes were golden brown and young as a boy 's . I found myself introduced , and shook hands with him almost eagerly . Oh , no , he could n't have done it ! Any luck ? ' he asked , and Len pointed to the dead hog . The old man was properly shocked . ' They 's some rotten folks in this kentry , ' he said , ' ef a man knowed where to find ' em . ' Right , there is , ' said Len , ' an ' I b'lieve I 'd know ' em ef I seen ' em . ' His black eyes looked kindlingly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your luck 's all right , uncle Ag . The boys jest now found a bunch o ' yore shotes down in that holler . ' Reckon they did n't have no years tore off ? ' he asked , repaying Len 's thrust . But no fight was precipitated because he accompanied his question with the frankest of smiles . Serena had often told me that you could say anything in the mountains if you took care to say it laughing . ' ' No , ' put in Sam , with a grin equally disarming , ' but if I 's as mean as some folks I 'd whacked off their years ragged-like , an ' druv ' em in home . The laugh went round . Both parties had spoken their minds . Old Ag bent over and touched the bullet hole . Them Copp boys air in the woods to-day . ' We knew what he meant , but if the Copp boys should ever get him car . nered not one of us could swear that he had accused them . Their gun makes the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Lea , with a steady look at Snead 's rifle . This was going too far . Snead rose up and looked about . He would be two against five , with maybe a woman to claw him from the back . A tolerant smile spread over his face . ' It shore does , ' he said . ' I 'll tell you what , boys I kai n't take my shotes in with jest Ted here to he'p me . S'pose I hunt with you to-day , an ' you he'p me to-more . ' Asking a favor was more disarming than laughter . This was a neighborly appeal , and Len was first , last , and always , a good neighbor . In two minutes we were all on our way to the haunt of the big b'ar hog , leaving the embryo feud , for a time at least , to smother under amenities . III Serena had slyly given me several opportunities to turn back with her . At last she openly rebelled . ' Ef yer goin ' down in them rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a fire on the ridge an ' set here till ye git back , if ye ever do git back . ' Stay if you want to , ' Len told her , an ' keep Ross to he'p ye pick up brush . Ef we roust that b'ar there 'd best be nobody round that kai n't hop quick . ' The entire party gave me a look which was a plain request that I keep Serena company . I was half angered . Come on , ' I said , taking the lead along the ridge . ' I hope you 'll enjoy yourself , Serena . ' They stood dubiously , then came on with a shout . Yer like my first wife , ' said Snead , striding alongside of me . Nothin ' could head her . You 've heard ' bout the man that had had three wives an ' when he prayed he would say , " God bless Patch , an ' Piece-patch , but dern of Tear-all . " Now I say it back'ards . My first un wuz Tear-all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em . There wuz n't any government them days . Ever ' feller had his own still ef he wanted one , an ' tended to his own business . Governments had n't come inter fashion . I 'd say to my wife , " Sorry , I 'd like to cut up fer a week an ' lay drunk , " an ' she 'd say , " Go it , Ag , I 'll ' tend to the crap . " An ' when I got through I 'd let her have her turn of she wanted it , and she generally did . When she wuz dyin ' she says , " Ag , you 've been square . You 've come as you wanted an ' gone as you wanted , an ' so ' ve I , bless Jesus . " " Yes , Serry , " I says , " you 've never been tied to the meat-skillet or wash-pot . " She laffed then an ' says , " I reckon you knowed that string would ' a ' broke anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to think my luck would n't turn , an ' I married agin in about six weeks . Lord , Lord , she cleaned an ' she cooked an ' she mended till I begged her to let up an ' go huntin ' with me . I wuz so lonesome I purty near cried , an ' all she done wuz to git down on her marr 's an ' pray fer my soul . " 0 Lord , " she says , " I 'll take keer o ' his pore neglected body ef you ' II jest save his soul . " Well , I set in then an ' made her glad to git out . I set down an ' cussed her steady fer two days . She was ready to go the first day , but said she could n't till she got ever'thing done . She left my clothes all fixed an ' the house like pie , an ' enough cooked to keep me fer a week , an ' me cussin ' her in a solid streak . She had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . It gives me the all-gonest , lonesome feeling now to think of how she worked an ' worked , an ' all I wanted wuz company . ' T wa' n't long till she married Ham Copp an ' I reckon he suited her fer they 're livin ' together yit . It 's her two boys what 's been so near that dead sow back yander , no matter what Len Merlin 's got in his head about it . You kai n't blame the boys , they been brought up so religious . I think a heap of religion , but you got to keep it in bounds er it 's like fire an ' water ; it 'll eat ye up . The Copp boys do n't want to be et up , an ' when they gets out they make t' other way , toward the Devil . I 'm a deacon , an ' pay my dues , but nobody can say I treat my religion too familiar . ' Sam called us to halt , and we paused in a body to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saplings scrambled for distorted life . He 's down there , boys . I 'll take Bub an ' Bugle , an ' Pap to carry the rope , an ' when we find where he is , y ' all stretch ' round above us , an ' I 'll go in an ' sic up the dogs . Len , you hold Buck . He 's my dog , an ' I ai n't savin ' him , but bein ' a fox dog he 's better fer the run , ef it comes to runnin ' . They ' s the masterest ivy thicket ' bout a quarter furder , an ' ef we roust him out he 's liable to make fer it . ' We began the descent , and as I stumbled laboriously downward I thought of Serena sitting by her fire , no doubt singing one of the many ballads which she had learned from her grandmother , and which had probably been sung by a score of generations before her without ever losing its essence in print . I stifled a lyrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty yards from the top we scattered and took our stations as Sam directed . Ef he breaks out , beat the bushes an ' make a noise like the whole Cher ' - kee nation full of corn-juice . ' Sam then went farther down , and was beginning to peer cautiously about for the boar when Len cried out , ' Hold on ! There he is ! At the top ! ' We looked up and saw the boar above us , monstrously outlined at the top of the ridge . He was huge and black , and my startled eyes magnified him to a fearsome thing . I found out later that he was not of inordinate size . He was poking a nose that seemed several feet long over the verge of a sheer cliff . There were simultaneous howls from the three dogs . The boar 's bristles rose like black Lombardy poplars ; as he flung himself around , his tusks , whiter than the whitest cloud , seemed to circle Heaven . He shot along the ridge , Buck plunging after him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take Bub an ' Bugle an ' make fer the thicket . That 's where he 's goin ' . ' Len , Burl , Ted , and Ben began to leap up the mountain-side and were soon racing along the ridge trail . I could be of no use in heading off the boar , and after one staggered look upward at the almost vertical slope I decided to follow Sam and granpap . Snead was of the same mind , and we struggled along , swinging from bushes and scrambling over boulders until we arrived at the ivy thicket , which was not ivy at all , but a mass of twisted kalmia from which several great chestnut trees rose in triumph . From somewhere in the tangled interior I could hear Sam 's voice constantly repeating a formula , ' Sic ' im , Bub ! Sic , sic , sic ! ' not loud but in a steady tone , half pleading , half commanding . Snead crawled into the thicket , and in about ten minutes was back again . Sam 's standin ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' an ' skeered white . eyed . But he ai n't in no danger , the ivy 's so thick round that sink-hole . Bub nor Bugle wo n't take holt o ' the b'ar . They prance all round him , much as the ivy ' 11 let ' em , an ' keep out o ' the way o ' his tusks , an ' that 's all . We got to have a dog that 'll take holt . Sam says fer me to send Ben down the mountain Pizen Branch way an ' git Jake Sutton 's ol ' dog , Drum . Drum 'll bring him out ef anything will . ' There ' s Buck . ' Shucks , ef Bub wo n't take holt we need n't wait on Buck . ' What 's granpap doing ? ' Nothin ' but squattin ' in the bottom o ' that sink-hole wishin ' he 's in prayer . meetin ' . ' Snead made his way up to the circle of silent watchers , and Ben was soon flying down the mountain Pizen Branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , but he would have to return slowly by a winding trail , and it would be nearly an hour before Drum could be one of us . In the meantime Sam , with the two dogs , endeavored to keep the boar entertained . Suddenly there was a shriek . A dark body was thrown into the air and fell on top of a thick bunch of ivy . " The blood jest sprinkled , ' said Sam afterward . He 's killed my dog , ' shouted Burl from the hillside . But Bugle had received only a skin wound and , scrambling down , crept with viscerated courage to his master . Sam kept on incessantly with the formula , ' Sic ' im , Bub ! Sic , sic , sic ! ' and finally called to Len , ' Send Buck in here ' less ye want me to git tore up . Bub ' s winded . ' From somewhere up the hill Len unloosed Buck , who rushed for the thicket . His entrance was Wagnerian , with a sound that reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black glimpses of the boar as he whirled about , charging at the agile Bub and missing him by a hair 's breadth . With the entrance of Buck he decided to run , and dashed along the tunnel ' that in happier days he had worn to his hiding-place . The dogs tumbled over each other and were slower in getting out . Sam appeared and shouted to the watchers above , ' Tear along up there ! Ef he gits round the mountain we might as well go home . ' I was at granpap 's heels and going fine , when he fell . He was n't seriously hurt , but sat on a rock rubbing his ankle , and I was astounded at the imprecations which he dropped on that ' b'ar devil . ' It meant more to him than being out of the race . Life had beaten him and gone on , and he knew it . ' Reckon they 'll say I done it a-purpose , ' he said forlornly . ' Oh no , they wo n't . Sam himself could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here till the pain gits meller . ' We waited , and the tumult died away and with it my hope of witnessing the capture . After a little we heard n a sort of scrambling in the bushes . ' That 's Ag , ' said granpap . ' He 'd git out o ' the run ef he had to break his neck fer it . ' A moment passed and Snead joined us , slightly limping . ' I was jumpin ' a blame rock , an ' it tumbled me off , ' he said . ' What 's the matter with the ol ' man ? ' ' Not a durn thing , ' said granpap. ' 1 jest ' lowed I 'd drap out . ' To show his scorn of subterfuge , he got up and took a few firm steps , then sat down , white with pain but grinning with triumph . ' I 'd give my coat an ' shirt to go with the boys , ' said Snead . ' M. I had n't struck on that sore knee I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Reckon I could n't , ' said granpap . ' When I got old I knowed it . Time ai n't slipped nothin ' on me . ' Well , I ai n't give in yit , ' Snead asserted , his yellow-brown eyes shimmering . ' These woods ' 11 be my back yard as long as I 'm topside o ' earth , an ' when I 'm under it I 'll rattle the dirt ef I can . ' ' I 'd do a lot myself , ' said granpap , ef I could do it with my tongue . ' Snead 's retort was lost in the returning tumult . The racers were coming back with a rush that made us think of scurrying to refuge . Sam afterward related what had happened . ' When I got out of the thicket , ' he said , ' I started over the rocks like a jumpin ' spider . Thet ol ' b'ar devil went straight like he was goin ' round the mountain , but the dogs kept bearin ' down on his upper side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't counted on meetin ' . He had to turn on ' em then , but they would n't rush in an ' he would n't rush out . The foam was flyin ' an ' Buck was all bloody . Them tusks had scraped some sense into him , an ' he was standin ' off , yappin ' an ' yowin ' . Little ol ' Bub was jumpin ' up an ' down an ' wantin ' like fire to go in , but he knowed better . " All we can do , " I says to Len when the boys come up , " is to hold the feller here till Ben comes with ol ' Drum . " An ' about that time the b'ar decided to come out an ' give them dogs a skeer . You run me in here , he thinks , an ' by golly I 'll run ye out . An ' he lit fer ' em . You never seen dogs so skeert . An ' that 's why we all come back . ' Cause that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after them dogs . It was the masterest thing to see him goin ' over ever'thing like he had wings in his insides . ' He was riding the saplings ' when we saw him , but we had no time for leisurely observation . We were in the most open strip of the brush and this was the highway for the chase . The dogs seemed divided between fear and shame . They rushed forward with their tongues out , but every few rods would fling their heads back as if to turn on their pursuer ; then at sight of him they would give an apparently dying screech and flee forward again . Scroonch up to that poplar , ' called Snead , ' an ' they ' 11 pass us . ' The poplar was an immense one , five feet through at the butt , and was only three or four yards from us ; but we had barely time to cross the distance and crowd against the tree before the wild runners flew by . I felt that the earth must be moving ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body ; the air ought to bleed , torn by those merciless tusks . They passed out of sight , to our left ; and very soon , on our right , we saw Sam . His shoes were ripped open , and his overalls , in strips from his knees down , revealed legs and ankles scratched and bloody . In his hard-set face I scarcely recognized the softly placating features of Sam . As he passed us he was muttering something about old Drum . Ef ol ' Drum 'll ever git here ! ' A few minutes later Len and Ted came up . Where 's Burl ? ' asked granpap . Back yander , tendin ' that no ' count dog o ' hisn . ' They hurried on , and Len called over his shoulder , ' Come on , pap , with yer rope . I hear Ben an ' ol ' Drum . We 'll git him now . ' We listened , and a long , deep , fresh-sounding bay echoed through the woods . Granpap grabbed his rope , dropping his lameness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels , boys , ' he said ; and like boys we followed . ' He ' s bayed agin , ' said gran-pap , as we neared a discord of indescribable sounds . Soon we saw the boar , on top of a lichen-covered boulder , sitting on his haunches , his eyes , like two little black stars , pouring vitriol that ought to have made the forest crumple . The rock itself , with its green , black , and creamy spots and vein-like roots climbing over it , seemed a part of the creature 's body , making a monster as superior to attack as granite , as formidable as if Nature had condensed her forces into his resisting form . The yapping dogs at the base of the rock , and the men with their ceaseless sic , sic , ' were as negligible as squeaking gnats . Sam was the only one with any apparent dignity . He had yielded to fatigue , and lay motionless on the ground , probably forty feet from me and an equal distance from the group about the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not loud , but of a sure timbre that made the woods quiver . The boar threw up his head and his sides thumped . From my safe distance I fancied a trembling among all the little ruffled scales of the lichens . Suddenly Ben 's young voice called out from somewhere above the rock , ' Go it , Drum , sic ' im , sic ' im ! ' and Drum 's huge yellow body vaulted from the slope to the upper edge of the boulder . At that instant the boar shot into the air , curved downward , and struck the ground near the men , scattering them to cover . He rolled for a second , like knotted ball , then found his four feet properly under him and made straight for Sam . For a second I felt blinded by a swirling black cloud , then stood clear-sighted in a small but painfully vivid human world . Nature with her everlasting forces retreated and consciousness was trivially reabsorbed in the by-product , humanity . I could even see Coretta , a pale widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insisting on an exchange of black percale ; and myself distractedly guiding the destinies of her fatherless young . But Sam was quicker than the boar . With one motion he leaped three feet from the ground , and with arms abnormally long seized the limb of a tree that stretched above him , drawing his body up accordion-fashion and hanging there like a half-opened jackknife . The boar dashed under him and on toward me . I resigned life resentfully . My passion for union with earth was spent . There was nothing but ignominy in being trampled into the ground and muddily- tusked . Drum saved me . I saw him at the boar 's side trying to reach his ear . The boar whirled in defense , and Len cried , Run , God A'mighty , run ! ' I supposed he meant me , but I could n't move . I had to see whether Drum got that ear or not . My arm was grabbed and I was viciously shaken . ' Ai n't you got a bit o ' sense ? ' That did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled to safety I managed to say , ' Thank you , Len , I guess I 'll ? faint . ' Which I did , but it was not a desperate lapse . I was up in a few minutes , watching the game between Drum and the boar , and commenting on it in a very small voice . It was worth seeing . Drum clearly understood his difficulty . He was to get his teeth into the boar 's ear and keep his own body safely guarded from the tossing tusks . They shuttled back was near getting a hold the boar would and forth , for every time that Drum i whirl in an effort to drive his tusk into the dog , and this would cause a face-about for both of them . I did not see how the game of wits and muscle could end except by the exhaustion of one or 1 the other ; and the boar was doubtless 1 using his last strength . It seemed shockingly unfair for Drum to come i i so fresh to the contest . 1 Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , though nobody needed the adjuration , all being tense and motionless . Drum 's gittin ' him winded . He 'll land in a minute . Be right still . ' I understood what he meant by landing ' when Drum finally sailed upward and dropped down on the boar 's back just behind his ears . He 's got him ! ' shouted Sam . ' GU yer sticks , ever'body . I 'll grab his leg . Y ' all be ready to come in , er he 'll tear me up of Drum 's holt breaks . ' But this time Drum held on , and the boar spun round and round helplessly . It seemed death to approach him , but Sam got behind a rock , lay down , and reached out a long arm , ready to grab a flying hind leg if it should come near . Len , you an ' pap git the noose over his nose . Where 's that Burl ? Let him an ' Ben hold my legs . ' But Burl called from a prudent distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all better keep out . ' ' Dern yer white skin , ' said Sam , git back to yer dry-goods box in Asheville . Ben , you an ' Ted ketch holt o ' my legs . ' They obeyed , bracing their feet against the rock , getting ready , it appeared , to pull Sam in two . Len , holding a big club , took the dangerous position of granpap 's guard in his attempts to noose the boar . Snead was to tie another rope about the leg if Sam succeeded in grabbing it . There was a ragged throaty shout . Sam had him . Snead , too reckless , rushed in on the wrong side and had to rush out again . Tie him , kai n't you ? ' puffed Sam . I ai n't no snake , I kai n't live in two pieces ! ' Snead made another rush and got the rope securely tied . This freed Sam , who made a grab for the other hapless hind leg of the boar , and the two were then made fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed his tusks in a last desperation , and Drum 's hold broke . The dog was thrown ten feet , just as granpap , by a miraculous move , got the noose around the boar 's nose above his tusks . Pap 's done it ! ' cried Len . And Pap 's got him ! ' echoed Sam . ' Me fer granpap ! ' shouted Ben . ' Smart fer or bones , ' said Snead ; and ' Hurrah , granpap I ' said I , to be with the tide . ' I could n't ' a ' beat it , ' said Burl , and Len turned on him . ' Ef you want to marry my girl , you 'll have to carry a better gun ' n I do . ' You got to pay fer my dog , ' said Burl , backing off . When Hell cools butter , ' said Len . Shet yer mouth of you can do it with those tight breeches on . ' Then his angry spurt was over . ' You goin ' to he'p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and looked at the boar . Forefeet and back were tied , and a long pole thrust under them . Safely trussed , but the tusks looked alive . ' I 'll he'p at his hind feet , ' said Burl , and laughter rolled over him . You walk ahead to keep the bears an ' Injuns off us , ' said Len . ' Ben , you an ' Sam git aholt the hind end o ' that pole . Me an ' Ted ' 11 take the front . ' They took off their jackets and , doubling them up , placed them between their shoulders and the pole . Wo n't it hurt him ? ' I asked , as they swung their load . Hurt that feller ? I jest wish we could , ' said Sam . I remembered that the creature was revenue and hardened my heart . We would get twenty-five dollars , at least , for him , half of which would be mine , the other half going to Sam and Len . As it was easier to keep around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come into the trail lower down , I said that I would go up to the ridge and get Serena . I should be glad to be out of sight of the pathetic monster swinging in torture from the pole . I got up the hill , and at some distance caught sight of Serena 's fire . She was placidly singing , in utter detachment from little Ross , who was playing horse ' up and down the ridge . The song was her favorite ballad about the cruelty of sundering true lovers . Sh ( liked to repeat it ; and though sh : usually began singing in a robust majo : key , with each repetition her ton ( would become more plaintive . sh ( was now at her happiest , in an un . bearably wailing minor . The girl persecuted by obdurate parents , had wandered from home ' And her lover , being at that very moment on that clear broad river , and passing that very tree , and picking up the same silver dagger , he ' percht it through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ? Serena , ' said I gently , would n't you just as soon say " pierced " as " percht " ? ' ' That would n't be doin ' right by granmommie . She always sung it that . a-way , an ' she was a hundred and three when she died , an ' died in her cheer . She knowed what she 's about to the last minute . She sung it " percht , " an ' I would n't change it noways . My , but you look like you 'd been bee . huntin ' in a locus ' patch ! ' I 've had a good time , Serena . ' So ' ve I , ' she said , getting up . An ' I did n't resk my life fer it nuther : We were to meet the men at the place where the spotted sow lay tied . Serena and I arrived first by a fete minutes , as the men traveled slowly with their burden , and stopped frequently to ' change the bone . ' We found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pig with her . We must find the other pigs , ' I said to the men , when they came up blowing and put their load down . We kai n't do that . It 's turnin ' colder , an ' it 'll be night now ' fore we git in home with this chap . ' But they 're so little ! They 'll starve ! ' ' Oh , half of ' em ' 11 scratch through alive . Let 's go fer water , boys . ' Everybody but myself went round the side of the hill to the spring . I stayed to ponder on the extravagant method of bringing in wild hogs . The thought of those ten or more little black and pink creatures shivering in the woods until starvation released them was more than I could supinely bear . I looked at the rope , and found it tied in what to me was an unalterable knot . But I could cut it by laying it against a rock and rubbing it with the sharp edge of another rock . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the rope as ragged as possible . When the stringy ends dropped no one would have suspected that the rope had been cut . The sow rushed off with her little pig following , and they were soon out of sight . Then I found that I too was longing for water , and hurried to the spring . I knew I should find the others lingering , each wanting to get in one more comment on the inexhaustible subject of the capture . ' We 'd better git back , ' said Len at last . ' Pap , you can drive the sow in . Thanks to gracious , we do n't have to carry her . ' It was an angry and bewildered group that paused at the spot where the sow had been tied . ' Dern her sides , wha ' d she mean by layin ' here all day an ' breakin ' the rope at the last minute ? ' said Sam . ' It wuz a good rope too . There wuz n't a weak spot in it . ' I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That young-un got holt o ' my plough-lines . I would n't ' a ' give ' em fer that ol ' sow . ' Ai n't it a cussin ' shame now Mis ' Dolly wo n't git nothin ' ? Ha'f that sow would ' a ' been hem . ' Course the b'ar is pap 's . It wuz pap ' at got in the throw that tied him . ' It was a moment before I got the full meaning of Sam 's words , and when I did my astounded silence seemed to create a slight embarrassment . ' Pap ' 11 give her a part , ' said Len , ef she wants to take it . Mebbe she did n't ' zackly mean what she told him ' bout havin ' what he could ketch . It ' 11 disappint pap , but we ai n't goin ' to have no hard feelin " bout an ' ol ' b'ar hog . ' I 'm shore glad , ' said Sam , ' that she saw pap ketch him , an ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a throwedaway dishrag off'n her underhand . Ez fer her not meanin ' what she said , her word 's as good in the woods as ' t is in the meetin'house . Ever'body ' 11 tell ye that . ' T ai n't jest me a-talkin ' . ' My inward tumult subsided . There was no profit in rebellion when the elements were against me . I looked at granpap , silent and apart , chewing his bit of dogwood . What about it , granpap ? ' What y ' all say 's good enough fer me . ' No help there , so I yielded with a gayety that left them slightly puzzled , not understanding the lubricant value of a good laugh at one 's self . The victory is yours , granpap . Let 's get him home . ' There was a buzz of spirited talk , all to show granpap that he was to be congratulated . When we started again Snead proposed going by Abe Siler 's . He 'll buy that feller right off the pole , an ' we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wantin ' to git a hog to pen right now , an ' he 'll give you six dollars fer that b'ar . ' Six dollars ! ' I exclaimed . ' Three weeks with all the corn he wants , and he 'll weigh out forty dollars ' worth of meat ! ' It'ud make a big hole in my pile o ' corn , ' said granpap . You gittin ' it wrong , Mis ' Dolly , ' said Snead. 13'ar meat as old as that feller is stringy an ' tough , an ' do n't make no grease to talk about . Ai n't hardly anybody ' 11 buy it . 01 ' Abe ai n't pertickler of he gits it cheap . He 'll take the green meat to Carson an ' sell it . An ' rec'lect the b'ar 's got to be knifed . That 's alters a resk . Six dollars is top money fer him . ' Yer talkin ' right , Ag , ' said gran-pap . ' Let 's go by Abe 's . ' He went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog , the buyer considering six a masterous price . ' Everybody seemed happy going home , except for a few regrets over the sow that got away , and a wail from little Ross for his lost pig . Everybody except myself . I was reflecting heavily in terms of profit and loss . All of my farm-help had given a day 's work ; they would give another to-morrow , helping Snead . Four men two days meant a loss to me of eight days ' labor . Coretta would surely shame me into contributing toward new shoes and overalls for Sam . I must also count my disturbing escape from starting a feud ; must even consider future entanglements on that score . Nor should I forget the emotional waste due to seeing every member of the party narrowly and frequently elude death from pitching head over heels into a rock-bed . And to its hopeless depths I must consider the probability of becoming indentured to the family of some ghost who had sacrificed his fleshly part in bringing out ' my ' hogs : that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and put an end to my list of contingencies . His voice was intimately lowered and I caught Sam 's eye following him furtively . I hate to see a woman git the worst of it when she 's tryin ' to be fair , ' he began . ' You 've got a fine hog-claim , an ' you ought to be gittin ' something out of it . How many hogs hey the boys brought in fer ye this year ? ' This is the first time we 've been after them . ' Course , though , the boys hey been out more'n once a-markin ' shotes ? ' I do n't know about that . ' Well , I do , fer I 've seen ' em . ' He called to Sam . ' Sam , how many shotes did ye git marked that day I seed ye out fer ' em ? ' Sam did not flinch under the attack . We marked a fine lot , ' he said . ' I do n't jest remember how many . I been meanin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' cause you 'll be wantin ' to ' low us something fer the markin ' . It 's shore hard work . That wuz when you 's gone to Hiwassee , an ' I fergot to tell ye when you come home . I knowed you 'd make it all right . ' What 's it worth to mark hogs , Sam ? ' It 's worth more'n ketchin " em , ' cause we 've got to ketch ' em an mark ' em , an ' turn ' em loose . But we 're goin ' to make it easier on you than that . ' I exonerate Sam from any intention of charging me for ' turning them loose . ' He was merely embellishing his defense . But by a brief calculation I saw that if I gave half the value of the hogs for catching and bringing them in , and the other half , or a little less , for marking the young , I would have to pursue my profit with a microscope . Snead again took up his confidential tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' there ai n't anybody in a hundred miles o ' me can swear I ever accused him o ' sepia ' other folks ' hogs ; but I wish you ' d a gone by Ham Copp 's next clay an ' seed what he had in his pen . I ai n't sayin ' what , an ' I never will say what , in court er out , but I ' low you 'd know yer own mark . ' Sam and Len had hastily entered upon a subdued conference of their own , and just then Sam called to Snead . Wiled you say , Uncle Ag , of we do n't he'p ye to-more , an ' call it square about them shotes you ai n't paid fer Ile was staggered , taken in the open , hut rallied jauntily . All right , boys ; jest as you say . ' Sam turned to me . ' We did n't tell ye ' bout them shotes Uncle Ag got , cause he was in sech a hole ' bout payin ' for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry ye till we got it fixed . Now he bits our part o ' the shotes fer he'ppin ' us to-day , an ' we 're willin ' to take yore part fer the markin ' you owes us , an ' wait on Uncle Ag fer it , seein ' we made sech a slow trade fer ye . ' By then I was in a position to foretell just the amount of revenue that in all time to come I was going to derive from my claim . ' We do n't want to take any downright money from ye , Mis ' Dolly , ' explained Sam . You 've never been hard on us , an ' we kai n't afford to be hard on you . An ' by fixin ' it the way I said , ever'body ' 11 be satisfied , an ' you wo n't be out nothin ' but a few shotes . ' ' And a few shotes , Sam , do n't matter when I 've got the woods full of them . ' ' That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods full of hogs is in a pretty good fix , is n't he ? ' Jest about fat rich , Mis ' Dolly . ' Then you and Len are rich . The hog-claim is yours . ' They thought it a joke at first , and I labored to convince them ; then they insisted on my keeping half of it . No , boys , ' I persisted generously . That would mix up our calculations . As it is , you 'll know what you 've got , and I 'll know what I 've got . ' You 're right about that , ' said Sam . I want to say too , that this deal works backward . If there 's anybody owing for hogs , the debt is yours , and you need n't ever bother me about it . ' ' An ' if any meddlin ' ol ' loafer comes tellin ' ye ' bout seein ' hogs here , there , an ' yander , in other folks ' pens , from time back , ' said Sam , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wuth a blue bean to him . ' I 'll send him to you and Len . It will be your affair , not mine . ' At that , Len came over to me . His face was serious but glowing . ' I knowed you 's white , ' he said , but I did n't know jest how white you wuz . Abe Siler 's beggin ' me underhand to leave you an ' work on his place . Next time he asts me , I 'm goin ' to bust my knuckles on them two big front teeth hisn . ' Len , who was noted as a cleancrop-man , ' was the most coveted tenant within three townships . I had bought his loyalty cheap . Sam , of coarser but shrewder mind , spared me any disconcerting gratitude . Before their early bedtime I was to hear his comment to Coretta , who was shedding grateful tears . Aw , shet up , K'rettie . I reckon she 's got sense enough to know that the woods full o ' hogs ai n't wuth much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
