" For whooping cough , pass the child nine times over and under a donkey from left to right . " That is a prescription of the 17th Century . For the same complaint , 100 years ago , a doctor would have shaken his head , stroked his beaver , written Pil . Quin . Sulph. on a brown pad , and the mother would have thought she had a cureall . Today medicos do not always find it necessary to fortress their ignorance with esoteric metaphors ; many can talk , some can even write , of their calling refreshingly , candidly , in simple words . An example is Dr. S. M. Rinehart , who has written The Commonsense of Health . ** <P> He writes about all the familiar plagues and problems of the body-from catching cold to cancer ; nor is there any trace of sickroom smirk nor of professional " strut in the way he does it . His style , in fact , is colored with a richness of literary allusion . For instance : " Do you remember Joe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Joe ! Damn that boy , he 's asleep again ' ? Joe had an overpowering predilection for meat pies and mutton and roast beef . He is a humorous character , in fiction . In real life , he would be Tragedy personified , because Joe was the victim of chronic poisoning . " <P> Later he paraphrases a celebrated classic to illustrate the sequence of disease transmission : " This is the germ of the bubonic plague . <P> DR . RINEHART " Do you remember Joe , the fat boy ?

" <P> In discussing that familiar patient , the t.b.m. , Dr. Rinehart takes occasion to define a medical term : " One day , after a good dinner followed by one or two of his favorite cigars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pain . It is a stabbing through the chest as by a sword-thrust . It runs down his left arm and at the same time there is a tightness round the chest walls like the constriction of an iron band . He would scream if he could , but he can not . Will he live to draw another full breath ? Cold sweat is on his forehead ; every muscle of his body tense ; his face pallid ; his pulse racing at an incredible speed . That is angina pectoris . " <P> Dr. Rinehart , now known to the medical world as a specialist in tubercular trouble , took his degree at the Allgemeine Krankenhaus , Vienna . He began his medical practice in Pittsburgh , where , in 1896 , he mar ried a trained nurse , Mary Roberts . During the War , he was in charge of the tuberculosis work at Camp Sherman , and afterwards of all the U. S. Army tuberculosis hospitals . This is his first book , but he once helped to write a play , The Avenger , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEALTH - Dr. S.M. Rinehart - Doran
