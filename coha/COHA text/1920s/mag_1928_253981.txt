A great and still flourishing statesman who dreamed a republic which came true has just set down his dream and much of his autobiography . Simultaneously has appeared a brilliant biography of the late Emperor Franz Josef out of whose realm the republic was dreamed . Both books have much merit : <P> Masaryk 's Dream . Post-War history has already chosen as its darling " The Lonely Slovak in Prague . " * With Wilson dead , Clemenceau withered and Lloyd George second-fiddling , it has become evident how great is Professor Thomas Garrigue Masaryk , first and still the only president of the Czechoslovak Republic . <P> In this volume President Masaryk traces arrestingly the steps whereby he dreamed and wrought his country out of Austria-Hungary . Prior to the War he was , among Czechs &; Slovaks at Prague in Austria-Hungary , only a professor , only a deputy . Yet a lionheartedness was in him , and perhaps a serpentine wisdom . By sheer , imperious leadership he welded friends , then students , then political adherents into an orderly group . It stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought an opportunity to strike for Czechoslovak freedom . As to just how this vital group was formed Professor Masaryk is regrettably a trifle reticent . He barely mentions by their last names a few of the men who aided him , then hurries on to the statement that " toward the Summer of 1915 . . . my authority was . . . recognized on every hand " among Czechoslovaks . <P> Meanwhile Professor Masaryk had escaped from Austria-Hungary . His unique distinction was to be that he would achieve the freedom of his people not as a revolutionary from within but as a propagandist from without . Settling first at Geneva and later in London , he wrote and labored unceasingly , with the aid of Dr. Eduard Benes , now Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia . Of him Masaryk writes : " He had great initiative and was an untiring worker . . . . I naturally took the lead . . . . Politically and historically he was so well trained that . . . he was soon able to act for himself . " ( Thus even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the most able active diplomat in Europe and who was made chairman of an important international committee See THE LEAGUE ) . <P> Of his propaganda Professor Masaryk writes laconically : " We never bribed . " He states that contributions received by him from U. S. Czechoslovaks totaled less than $1,000,000 between 1914 and 1918 . Yet with these sums and by his own pamphleteering and lecturing he was unquestionably able to create an Allied and later a U. S. mass-sympathy for Czechoslovakia . One successful move was to exploit the arrest of his own daughter Alice by Austro-Hungarian officials , for " people argued that when even women were imprisoned our movement must be serious . Throughout America women petitioned the President to intervene . . . . "
