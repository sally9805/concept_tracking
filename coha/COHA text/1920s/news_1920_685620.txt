txt Both The American , . which opposes any League except of the enemies of England , and The Tribune , which is enthusiastic for any and all conceivaable leagues except the only one which the Peace Conference found it possible to construct , unite in complaining of the League 's inactivity in the RussoPolish war . The Tribune laments that " . no One seems ' even to suggest action through or by the League . " Mr. LLOYD GEORGE in his speech in the House of Commons on July 21 said that " if Poland is attacked in her legitimate territory " ( meaning the territory assigned to her by the Peace Conference ) " Great Britain is " bound , by the covenant she has en " tered into , by her own interests , by " the interests of Europe , and bound " by the general interests of the " world , to give every assistance in " her power to a nation assailed in " this way . " A warning of the obligation under the League Covenant had been conveyed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune seems to think that thereupon , under the provisions of Article XVII. , Bolshevist Russia should have been invited into the League . Whether or not this was desirable is debatable , but at any rate it was not feasible . For the Bolshevist reply to the British note remarked that the Soviet Government had never received from " the so-called League of Nations " " any communication as to its creation and existence . " All it knows about the League is what it has read in the papers , and apparently LE Nnsi never believes what he sees in the capitalistic press . But even if the reports in the papers are true , " the " Soviet Government can in no way " agree that one group of Powers " should assume the role ' of supreme " body over all the States of the " world . " HIRAM JOHNSON might have written that , and Senator HARDING could well accept it . Therefore , said the Russian note , - the Soviet Government " absolutely re " jects every immixion of this associa " tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here is a word that Senator HARDING may be expected to use as soon as he hears of it , and here is an attitude toward the League of Nations identical with that of the accredited leaders of the Republican Party . The League Council has not recommended to the members military action against Russia . If it had , the ? epublican press would be using it as an awful warning of the ease with which American boys could be sent abroad to shed their blood at the behest of foreign potentates . Since it has not , The . Tribune hopefully suggests that before the Senate meets again the League Covenant " may have died " from general atrophy without mak " ing a squeak , " thereby giving the Republican Party a chance to get the credit of " hopefully approaching the nations of Europe and the earth , " as the Republican candidate puts it , to start a new League . - In orthodox Republican eyes , especially in the eye : of those Republicans whose orthodoxy is recently and hastily assumed and is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it does and damned if it doesn't.
