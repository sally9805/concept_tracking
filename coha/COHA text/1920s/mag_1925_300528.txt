John Delaney , light-heavyweight , is another gentleman who believes implicitly in the might of his right mauler . Standing in the middle of the most magnificent prize-ring in the world-a ring with posts of brass , bucket-holders of brass , seats braced with brass , and ropes of bottle-green plush-the Star Chamber of the new Madison Square Garden , Manhattan-he pushed that fist so violently into the face of Paul Berlenbach that the latter fell down and reclined on his side , head , ear , shoulders , hips and legs . The referee 's arm began to rise and fall and a great crowd rose in pandemonium , for it was a fact patent to all that if burly Berlenbach ( " the Astoria Assassin " ) did not get up shortly , Delaney would be the light-heavyweight champion of the world . For a moment everybody began to feel sorry for the prone ex-taxi-driver , one of the most unpopular plug-uglies that has ever held a world 's title , but yet an individual that few people have had the opportunity to feel sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an assassin , true that his style of fighting is , to say the least , ungracious , but he owns two qualities that have carried him far-great strength , great courage . As he lolled under the fierce moon-fire of the ring-lights , pitifully twisting his enormous body in an attempt to rise , it was clear that his strength was no longer at his disposal . And his courage ? " ... Nine " counted the referee . Berlenbach lurched to his feet . Delaney flicked him with a sharp left . Berlenbach came plunging in . Again Delaney 's left , again his proficient right . Berlenbach came plunging in , continued to plunge in for the remaining 11 rounds , until , in the 14th and 15th , he hammered Delaney so limp that the referee and the crowd agreed that the title should be his to keep for a while longer .
