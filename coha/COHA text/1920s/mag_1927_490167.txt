POSTING a letter by air mail is probably an old trick to business executives and lovers but to us ? by nature neither busy nor lovelorn it was quite an experience . We did it yesterday for the first time . We paid the extra tax and approached the brilliant red-white-and-blue box expectantly , with all Fifth Avenue ( it seemed to us ) looking on . Dropping it was fun . Nevertheless , we must warn our constituency that air-mailing takes up a good deal of time . Such was our interest in aviation  --  incited by months of newspaper headlines  --  that no sooner had we posted the letter than we commandeered a taxi , drove full speed to the landing field , and saw it off . PERSONS like Mr. Ziegfeld , Mr. Dillingham , and the scandalous Mr. George White unquestionably know what they are doing when they charge $6.60 for a seat . On the other hand , persons like ourself  --  who have a sixth sense just like a homing pigeon unquestionably know what we arc doing when we say that $6.60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment After many years of walking round , hang-dog fashion , refusing to pay any such absurd amount , we have filially come to at least one interesting solution . Every big expensive show like the " Follies " should be sold by the act . Three-thirty per act . At the first curtain , ushers could go through the house and collect from anyone who desired to remain . In that way a great many people could see the " Follies " who otherwise never would . It does n't sound like a very good soluLion , so we are going to keep on working . THE eight Little sycamore trees on the corner of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue ( yes , ma'am , there are eight little sycamore trees on that corner ) cast their leaves regretfully and prematurely to the ground and are standing there , naked and unhappy .

THE dimly lighted and silent movie houses of the past were unique places of escape from the turmoil of the busy marts , and we used often to slip into one after lunch and enjoy a nice nap . It is now out of the question . First came the sixty-piece orchestra , the specialty singers and clog dancers . Now success has apparently crowned the efforts of the movie managers to devise a sound for every motion shown upon the screen . A famous war picture is enlivened by an ingenious clamor reproducing the noise of hundreds of trucks moving up to the front . An interesting film taken on board a German U-boat becomes bedlam by the loud banging of cymbals every time a ship is shown sinking . We saw a news reel last week of motorcycles climbing a hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sad that theatre managers do not grasp the fact that the picture of a motorcycle climbing a hill in utter silence would be a great and beautiful achievement . Retort FASCINATED always by the sight of a worm about to turn , we paused the other afternoon to watch a meek little gentleman who was using one of the telephone booths in the Plaza . He stood there a long time , obviously having slipped the operator 's mind . Seated at her station in the centre of the booths she was busily engaged in pushing in plugs , pulling them out , reciting numbers , making change for patrons and declaring at intervals , " The liyen is bizeh . " Such an example of organized efficiency was she that the meek gentleman palpably tacked determination enough to recall himself to her attention . We had about given up hope that he would take his own part when she caught sight of him over the switchboard . " Are you waiting for a number ? " she demanded .

From this admittedly tricky distance nothing in prospect , it seems , has aroused greater anticipation among first nighters than the coming of Max Reinhardt and a group of his players for a repertoire of German plays , to be followed by productions in English . This will serve as a forerunner , it is hoped , of several seasons of the notable Reinhardt Shakespearian repertory . The Reinhardt project is a little gift to America by Otto Kahn . He is financing it . " Porgy , " from the DuBose Heyward book , will open the Theatre Guild 's season next month and Mr. Shaw 's " The Doctor 's Dilemma " will follow .

Mr. George Arliss is waiting for a good play ( not a revival ) . There will be no Barrymores , what with John and Lionel in the movies and Ethel on tour . Profit WE have just learned of a wealthy summer Long Islander who was standing at the entrance of his handsome estate recently when a motorist drew up and , impressed with the beauty before him , asked to be shown about the place . The financier , having nothing better to do at the moment , conducted the visitor over the property in his politest manner .

We now learn that automobile license numbers in this ingenious city can be made to match trademarks as well . A car to he seen every day in the Forties bears the license 1C-4711 . It belongs to Mr. William Kropff , president of the company which manufactures No. 4711 toilet products . Shine WHEN a fair young lady of our acquaintance climbed into a chair to have her shoes shined in Grand Central Terminal the other day , the bootblack turned to his partner and said , " Grazie a Dio , dope tutte le vecchie , ecco nna giovanetta !

" ) Pony Man MERE watchers of the Interna- tional polo matches may not have heard of Mr. Godfrey Preece , but you may be certain that all of the THE NEW YORKER players know him . He is an expert on polo mounts and a captain of the polo-pony industry . He has a notable stable at Westbury , L.L , and during his twenty years there has bought and sold thousands of mounts . During this year , we are told , Mr. Preece disposed of two hundred and twenty ponies for a total of $150,000 . He sterns to have the same ability in picking equine stars that Mr. Griffith of the films displays in making actors out of passers-by or studio electricians . Wrack ' Em Up , favorite mount of Watson Webb , was discovered by the pony man in a contractor 's stable in Washington , D. C. There is romance in his business . He bought for a song , not long ago , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a honkytonk track in Mexico . Later he sold her to Winston Guest for $7,000 . Mr. Preece 's method of locating promising ponies is simple . " You get on a train and go places , " he says . Doing this , he has picked up all over the country excellent mounts from between the shafts of grocery wagons or idling in stables or flicking flies in meadows . Some time ago he saw polo possibilities in a horse named Scaramouche , but the animal would n't be trained , and Preece sold it to a lady as a hack . He decided afterwards that he had given up too soon , bought back the pony , trained it successfully this time and sold it into the famous Harry Payne Whitney stables for several thousand dollars . The firm of Preece &; Sons was established in 1830 in England by the father of Godfrey . The present head has two sons , Terence and Stewart , both polo players of considerable ability . Terence has a gift for riding his father 's mounts to excellent advantage in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals are trained , and prospective buyers are always impressed . The youth rides clad in an outfit which is distinguished by a skull and crossbones emblazoned on the riding boots . Preece the elder is well over six feet , wears a black mustache , a high choker collar , and effective ties and suits . He addresses his important visitors , even on their first appearance , as " Old Boy " and by their first names . A Good Deed IT was our pleasure to meet with the Boy Scout spirit , fully matured , aboard a Long Island train recently . At one of the stations the gentleman seated in front of us accidentally dropped a glove out the window just as the train started to move out . Without a moment 's hesitation he tossed the other one after it . Moved by curiosity , we dropped all reserve to ask him why he had done so . He courteously explained that the one glove that remained would have done him no good ; nor would the lost glove have done the finder any good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , so that the finder might have a complete set . Speculation DESPITE all the recent disclo-1.  --  , sures , we conclude that the theatre-ticket brokerage business is not all peaches and cream . We were told last week of two ambitious young men who , deciding to turn speculators , pooled their joint capital and staked it all in opening an office next door to a theatre in which a much advertised musical comedy was to open . Their plan was to specialize in seats for this production . They bought out a tailoring establishment , took possession and installed a counter and a sign . They then met trouble . The producer , with the restlessness of his kind , opened in a theatre three blocks away . A large sign now advertises for sublease a shop " excellently located for a tailoring establishment .

The latter happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose husband died six years ago , leaving an ambitious country estate half completed , and several million dollars . He had dreamed of combining , in his magnificent manor , the best parts of American and European motifs and decorations , and the widow resolutely went ahead with the program . An army of contractors , decorators and landscape gardeners at once laid siege . New experts appeared upon the grounds every day . For years the work went on . Twelve coats of paint were put on the walls of one room because it " was the thing in England . " Panelling from Spain was insisted upon by a counsellor in panelling who one day presented himself . Special soil for artificial terraces was carried by motor-trucks from New Jersey . Trees were imported from Connecticut . The driveway was built of fifteen layers , including Caen stone imported from France at the instance of a consultant in driveways . A year ago the work was completed and the lady , after properly staffing the place , sighed and settled down to live in it . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the round of specialists . They disagreed , alas , held a consultation and decided to call an eminent ( the most eminent they could think of ) diagnostician . The latter examined her , questioned her , visited her at her estate , and , in the end , gravely reported , " Madam , your trouble is your home . Your house and grounds and twenty-two servants are too much of an administrative problem . Your only chance is to retire to some quiet place and live simply . " The lady , we are informed , has accepted the counsel . She closed her house , paid the diagnostician 's tenthousand-dollar fee , and left with two servants for California , where she is now living in a bungalow .

Phone AGENTLEMAN with a habit of getting behind the scenes reports the existence of an interesting specialSEPTEMDER 17 , 19 27 ist . He works for the telephone company and his task is to read the newspapers every day and to assign extra operators to those exchanges where unusually heavy traffic seems likely to occur . For example , the breaking of a water main in a certain section foretells an exceptional number of calls to the waterworks authorities . Several conventions at a certain hotel means increased need for operators on the exchange that serves it . Epidemics and disasters must be localized for the same purpose . The weather , it seems , has to be watched with great care . An inclement night brings a deluge of calls for taxicabs . The specialist in charge of this work , one Mr. Williams , is reported to receive ten thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of OUR our amusement , was called forth by the fact that practical jokers are one of the phone company 's major problems . We were surprised to he told that the ancient ribaldry of having one 's friends call Whitehall 1560 and ask for Mr. Fish necessitated a few years ago one of the largest staffs of special operators the company has ever mobilized . The number in question is , of course , the Aquarium . The pleasantry reached such proportions that thousands of calls a day were made by unsuspecting gentlemen who , returning from lunch , found on their desks a note to call that number . The Aquarium had but a single wire and it was swamped . The staff of special operators was then created . It was their duty to cut in on all calls to the fish home and ask if the caller was trying to get the Aquarium . This demanded tact and subtlety . We are told that the victim , nettled at the interference , most often said , " I do n't know what the place is , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point the joke usually dawned on him and he hung up with a few rapidly chosen words . In this way , however , the calls were diverted until the joke wore off . We can only hope that these sentences will not cause a recurrence of the distressing practice . Sentiment GRANITE , with a top-soil of thirty-minute egg  --  that is the traditional texture of the box-office man 's heart . And like all hard-hearted persons , way under the granite there is a rich mother lode of sentiment . Last week  --  we have it on the word of one of the conspicuously veracious managers  --  it happened that about 7:30 one evening two tickets , fourth row aisle , were returned to the box office of a theatre where one of the town 's two tremendous successes is playing . " Well , " said the treasurer to himself , " I feel a little romantic this evening .

At 8:25 as handsome and devotedly affectionate pair of young folks as our hero ever had seen walked up to the window . " Got two for tonight ? " asked the bridegroom . " Sure , " replied the happy treasurer , " two in the fourth row , on the aisle . " The handsome gentleman consulted the beautiful lady . " The show must be terrible , " he said to her , " if you can get the fourth row at this time of " Dad , when is your birthday ? " " Oh , some time in the spring . " night . " And to the treasurer , " No , thanks . " Whereupon the treasurer rescrambled to type . West End AvenueN first sight West End Avenue O 1 , - .1 appears to be a fine residential street , lined with beautiful edifices , ornamented with splendid trees . After you have watched it for a while , it becomes incredible . Taxi drivers say they receive smaller tips on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an infallible sign that both streets are peopled with those who have money  --  not those who are earning money , but those who have it . The similarity of the two streets does not end there . Although West End has trees instead of a railroad as a decoration , although upper Broadway , instead of Upper Fifth Avenue , is one block distant from it ; its sidewalks , like those of Park Avenue , are all but deserted and its windows have the blank and empty air that means respectability . There are no handkerchiefs drying on the windows . But the great difference is that Park Avenue 's prosperity looks like New York , whereas West End Avenue 's looks like Buffalo . Incredible but true The lonely figure on the sidewalk , instead of being a Park Avenue red-faced old gentleman in a tight collar making for his club , is an old lady in black with a long black veil . As on Park the expensive doorbells are polished , but the polisher is a maid in a purple uniform and spotted calico apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Pinscher but a fat chow , and the young lady who is " Father , what do get on your birthday ? " exercising him wears glasses . The entrance to the apartment house is very elegant , but the elevator man is just buttoning his coat as you come in . The man driving up in the fine car ( a Pierce Arrow instead of an Isotta ) looks not in the least like a stockbroker or a sportsman but like a husband . The most expensive baby carriages that money can buy are being pushed by maids not in uniform . THERE is another thing about this avenue . On Park will occasionally appear a fair one of maturer years who by heroic self-denial has brought her figure within the dimensions prescribed by fashion ; but not on West End . It is not strange that sonic should run to oversize but that all should be fat is very odd . It is a part of the street , perhaps . It gives it its color . Here , if anywhere on earth , are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools fearlessly up to the front door , the coatless laundryman rings the bell and delivers his bundle unabashed . There are neither policemen nor traffic lights ; meeting on the corner , ladies gossip instead of talking scandal ; and from a distance comes the sound of a piano  --  it is the pride of the family playing her Rachmaninoff Prelude . So long as West End Avenue is with us , Manhattan Island can never be called altogether bad . ? MIXTURE REPORTED : The Eldorado : One part brandy , one part red Curacao , and two parts champagne .
