To 10,000 individuals in high places last week came an oblong black box as tidy as a high grade cigaret package or a lady 's vanity case . And on the black , in gold , was the device and motto of Fisher Bros. - the old coach and " Body by Fisher . " Inside the box were two packs of auction bridge cards , with the intimate feel of good linen and etched silver . The backs of the cards carried , against black backgrounds , white illustrations from Fisher Body advertisements . So while the 10,000 and their guests played auction bridge with Fisher cards , there faced them in black &; white the slim maid of the advertisements with her two Scotch terriers cuddled against her , or the proud young woman in flying clothes ready to mount her plane . To prepare and send such cards to 10,000 was a deed of advertising brilliancy , one of professional finesse . <P> Heaped on this brilliancy promoting Fisher Bros , bodies last week was the full page newspaper advertisement which noted another Fisher brothers accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! When the prediction was made last year that the Fisher Building would be ready for occupancy in September , 1928 , leaders in both the building and architectural fields scoffed at the idea . It could n't be done , they said-but it is being done . Production methods born of the automobile industry have overturned the time-worn traditions of the building industry . With the genius characteristic of Detroit , the seemingly impossible has been accomplished . For the thousands interested in Detroit 's civic progress and also for those planning to occupy this magnificent building , we record the progress of the Fisher Building as of June 1st . In ninety more days the doors will open . A promise fulfilled-a tremendous achievement consummated. "
