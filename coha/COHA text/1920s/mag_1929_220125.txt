Cinema stars are seldom good mathematicians . Confronted with the U. S. income tax , many of them are reduced to flabby incompetence . They journey across the U. S. from Hollywood to " fix things up " personally at the Treasury Department . That grey classic building , they have found , affords a new and unusual background for " still " pictures of themselves on business bent . Last year Secretary Mellon 's department had the honor of professional calls from Mary Pickford , Douglas Fairbanks , Richard Barthelmess . <P> But the Hollywood habit of turning income tax matters over to " counselors " who promise to save a taxpayer large sums provided the benefits are equitably divided , has now led to a terrifying state of affairs . Two such " counselors " for cinema folk , Miss Marjorie Berger and Edward H. Hayden , were last week indicted by a U. S. grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of preparing fraudulent tax returns for their big-salaried clients . Cinemactors and actresses quaked at the possibility of conspiracy charges . <P> The U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some $24,000 tax payments on a $182,779 income in 1927 . Other of her clients were William Haines and Dorothy Mackaill . <P> Against Hayden was the charge that by fine manipulation he had reduced the tax payments of Fred Niblo , director , about $10,000 , Ramon Novarro , $8,000 , Raoul Walsh , $12,000 and George O'Brien , $2,000 . <P> <P> Most of these cinema taxpayers were only too anxious to meet large penalty assessments rather than criminal charges . A large migration from Hollywood to the Treasury Department may be shortly anticipated .
