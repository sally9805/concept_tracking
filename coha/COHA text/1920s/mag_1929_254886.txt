The potency test of a French Prime Minister is whether he can lash his budget through the Chamber of Deputies by Jan. 1 . Nobody had done it for years until 1926 , when great Raymond Poincar made budget punctuality the crux of his saviorship of the franc . Last week the savior 's smart disciple and successor , Prime Minister Andr Tardieu. battled to equal the record of his chief , battled also to vindicate his own nickname , " The Most American of Frenchmen " ( TIME , Nov. 11 ) . <P> This year budget punctuality is not imperative . France is vastly prosperous . Surplus tax collections have been piling up over estimates month after month . Therefore , argued many a Deputy last week , why not go back to the good old pre-Poincar system ? In those days the budget debate was a tournament of oratory lasting well into March , April or even May . <P> The object was to give every Deputy a chance to speak for at least half a day on the budget clauses particularly interesting to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberant pork barrel . <P> Vigorously last week Tardieu L'Amricain lashed into the Deputies a proposal to hold three sessions every week day until the budget is voted . If they must talk , let it be morning , noon and night , until the bitter end . With much grumbling they assented . Then Tardieu did a double-snapper with his whip-demanded that they sit thrice a day on Sunday too . Rebellion loomed , but Ringmaster Tardieu fired a figurative blank cartridge , demanded a vote of confidence . After less than a month in Power he has the Deputies so thoroughly cowed that they licked his hand 350 to 142.
