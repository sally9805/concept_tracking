In quest of adventure , two blithe British women took off last week . One , Lady Mary Bailey , with a mad flourish of acrobatics , hopped across Europe on her lonesome way to Cape Town , Africa . The other , the Hon. Elsie Mackay , madcap daughter of James Lyle Mackay , Viscount Inchcape of Strathnaver , muffled herself almost beyond recognition and stealthily departed with one-eyed Capt . Walter G. R. Hinch-liffe on the treacherous flight across the Atlantic , Westward . <P> Lady Mary is , blithe and blither , on her way . Miss Mackay , with Capt . Hinchliffe and their golden-winged monoplane Endeavor , is in the limbo of the lost . <P> Lady Mary , champion woman aviator of 1927 by edict of the International League of Aviators , is taking the 6,000-mile trip from London to Cape Town solely for amusement- " to see how far I can go . " She is taking her time , flies when she feels like it , even when that means ( as it did at Marseilles ) landing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby Moth , popular with European amateurs . Near her destination are the gold and diamond mines of her husband , Sir Abe . <P> The Hon. Elsie Mackay , 34 , daughter of a peer , has done daring things since childhood . Unimpressed by her father 's millions ( Peninsular &; Oriental Steamship Co. ) , she eloped with Capt . Dennis Wyndham ( before the War , an actor ) and laughed at disinheritance . She went on the stage herself and on the screen , as Poppy Wyndham . Suddenly she had her marriage annuled and returned to her father 's home . As suddenly she took up flying , won her pilot 's license five years ago , and nourished the determination to be the first woman to fly the Atlantic . <P> Dark , not unattractive , graceful , habitually well-gowned and bejeweled , Miss Mackay was the envy of most women . Her silver Rolls-Royce flashed by at breakneck speed . Her horses invariably galloped . She even participated in an " outside loop , " most dangerous of all stunts in air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Her safety-strap broke during the loop , but she clung with amazing wit and courage to bracing wires , while her body swung outside the plane like a stone twirled on the end of a piece of string . ) She was fond of animals , particularly horses and dogs , and one of the tragedies of her life was the death of her favorite borzoi , who jumped thirty feet out of an open window and broke his neck in a vain attempt to reach her side . <P> Few saw Capt . Hinchliffe and Miss Mackay take off from Cranwell Airdrome , England , for the War veteran had told only two friends he was going and Miss Mackay had promised her family she would not . None is known to have seen them once they got beyond the Irish coast . A crowd of 5,000 stood all night at Mitchell Field , Long Island , waiting for them . But they never came . <P> Four other women have tried to span the Atlantic by air and none has succeeded . <P> Princess Lowenstein-Wertheim , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Leslie Hamilton and Lieut . Col. Frederick F. Minchin . They were last sighted over Ireland . <P> Ruth Elder was next , leaving New York Oct. 11 with George Haldeman . They came down in the ocean off the Azores , and were so fortunate as to land beside the Dutch steamship Barendrecht . They were rescued as their plane caught fire and sank . <P>
