I KNOW very well that poppies arc only weeds , and of no ornamental value , since they fall to pieces as soon as you take them into the house ; but , you see , orchids wo n't grow where we live , and poppies will . You have to take a lot of things into consideration , whether you 're planting gardens or civilizations ; and in the wild waste places of my desolate land you can depend on the poppies . The hail knocks out the wheat , and the frost nips the roses , and the sandstorms bury the pansies ? but still the poppies blow ! Weeds , of course , but colorful weeds , courageous weeds , breaking the dun desolation with the brightness of their hue and the strength of their persistence . I ask yOu very humbly to consider this , because I know you will be impatient with me that I did nothing for Juliette . What I should have done is quite obvious , but I have not always done the things I should have done ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations ? things are born and they grow , and mate , and bear their young all by themselves , without any particular direction from me ? and though I am supposed to lead my people into a higher and happier way of living , sometimes their own way seems to me much more attractive than the ways which I know . I did n't want to teach the Belgians anything . Every time they took another step toward Americanism I was sorry ? I could n't help being so . The littlest boys came to school on the first day of the term in little blue knee-pants with white shirts and wide ruffled collars , and tight little round hats with ribbons , set on top of their shocks of yellow hair , Their saucer-blue eyes stared innocently at me , and they bowed with quaint little gestures of boundless respect . The second day one of them had picked up on the road an old straw hat that some American child had thrown away , and Belgium receded a thousand miles . In another week the ruffled collars vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the wide blue eyes and the yellow hair , and the hurried utterance that spoke of insufficient acquaintance with a foreign tongue . But on Tuesdays ? . . They had church on Tuesdays because the priest had to come out on that day from town to hold services , having his own parish to attend to on Sundays . All work was suspended , and by nine o'clock the long roads were all a-flutter with ruffles and apron-strings and neckerchiefs and ribbons ? first the school children , leaving their buckets at the schoolhouse , and taking off their overalls and aprons there so that they might be properly dressed for church ; then the big blond , goldenbearded men in quaint American clothes which did not fit very well , and the women leading their littlest children by the hand . I wish you could have seen those little children ! Belgian women do not devote a great deal of thought and care to their own costumes , and they are really not so very pretty after they 've grown up , but the little girls are rapturous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little silk bodices of a lighter hue , and lace caps with blue rosettes ; and their yellow hair frames faces of roseate loveliness with placid blue eyes glowing reflectively ? a part of the bright blueness of my blue , blue wilderness . The little church was directly across the road from the schoolhouse ; I stood hesitating in my doorway until I should be invited , and it is curious , but true , that there was a hard lump at the base of my throat as I watched the people gathering in the churchyard . They were so quaint ! And it was not as if I had gone to seek them in a far land . If I bad paid a guide to show me the historic villages of Belgium , I should probably have looked at them and smiled , as you do at any other spectacle ; but that such an innocent , childish , primitive people should have braved the terrors of a barren land , from which the sturdiest had turned with a shudder , could not help but bring a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I love it for its wildness and its terrors and for the unconquerable heart of it ; for the courage of its people and for the splendor of its achievements ? it 's a Viking land ; a sky-land ; a star-land . But it 's more than this ? it 's a land of earth-bound peasantry , of age-old traditions , of simple and primitive people , shining tranquilly and steadfastly as stars . You could n't help tears no matter how giddy and thoughtless you were by nature . All without plan or deserving , you found yourself in a mediaeval Belgian village , as if you 'd gone to sleep in a Belgian picture gallery and all the pictures had come to life . The quaint little church with its pointed spire , the quaint little children in their quaint attire , the placid quiet women secure in the serenity of ages , the golden-bearded men , the eager-eyed youth ? the bottomless blueness of a western desert sky ! And Juliette ! It was Juliette who finally came shyly across the road and said that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cared . She was nearly twenty , big and splendid , with a skin like chiffon andeyes of astonishing innocence . Her hair was a mist around her face . Such a girl ! All the women sat on one side of the church and all the men on the other , and although Juliette timidly proffered me her prayer-hook , I did n't turn the pages very often . I could see nearly everybody from where I sat , and my eyes roved unmanageably over the little congregation . The bright yellow heads of the men were all uncovered now and bent over their prayer-books . I wondered which one stood high enough above the others to be worthy of Juliette . It 's curious , you know , how in all these little settlements there is one who by some strange accident stands above all the others and presently breaks away to form a new society ; but all the yellow heads were alike ; and when we came out of church , though many eyes were turned on J uliette , nobody came forward to walk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shyly said good-by , and walked home with her father and mother . So Juliette 's lover had not come to church that morning . Sometimes , I found , he did n't . I met him soon , and I could not fail to know him . Everybody was harvesting ? that is , everybody who had anything to harvest ? and life was a great festival . You know how it is in American harvest fields . The man says , " Well , got ta have the harvesters next week . " The woman says , " Then you got ta go to town and get me some help . I 've gone through about the last harvest I 'll ever go through . I 'm sick and tired cooking for hired hands , and I wo n't do it again . " So it was with Carrie Haydon , down on the Horseshoe Bar Stock Ranch . All they had to put up was hay , and they hired twelve men to work outside and two girls inside . But the Belgians loved harvest time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They began at one end of the settlement to help one another , all the men and women gathering at the farthest farm ; and those women who were n't cooking in the house worked out in the fields , and loved it . The boys at school were restless , but we hurried through lessons and went home early to the house where the harvesting was in progress . I went , too . I love harvesting ; and I praised all the things we had to eat , and helped carry food out to the men , and even had the temerity to show the women new dishes , though 1 must confess this last proceeding was due more to a love for showing off than to a desire to he truly helpful . The women exclaimed in wonderment . " But your hands are white ! " they cried , " and still you can cook ! " We had five meals every day . There was breakfast at six , when everybody went out to the fields ; at ten those of us who had stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men stopped their work and took our meek offerings ; at twelve we served them humbly again ; at three we took them more food ; at six we again stood behind their chairs ; and then we danced . It was quaintly pretty . When I had on an apron and my hands full of baskets and jugs , I was a peasant woman , too , and the men regarded me with the same lordly indifference that they bestowed on their own women ; quite different from the reverence they paid me as an officer of the law when I stood iu the doorway of the schoolhouse . The older men never spoke to me ? it was n't being done . Sometimes they met me riding along the road with one of the men from the ranches , and they would stop to speak to the man . " You go ride with our teacher ? " " Yes , a little bit . " " She like our school ? " " Do you like the school ? " the boy would ask me . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , " the boy would say . " Tell her , glad she like our school , " said the Belgian . " He says he 's glad you like their school , " the boy reported , gravely . " It 's a wonder he would n't let me say so myself ! " I 'd grumble . It 's curious , you know , to be talked over in your own language as if you were a piece of wood . But the young men were n't so particular about etiquette . They knew it was n't proper to speak indiscriminately to the ladies ; but youth is daring , and when it has a reckless leader then there are no bounds to its adventuring . This leader was the gay , the dashing , the brilliant Jean-Baptiste ? Jean-Baptiste of the shiny black hair , the glorious brown eyes , the daring confident smile ! Jean-Baptiste , whose heart was wrapped around the heart of Juliette . JeanBaptiste did not come to church , but he came to harvesting . He it was who ventured first into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with the baby . There was a phonograph with three records , one of them the Star Spangled Banner , which I did not put on . The baby crowed when I played one of the others , and being exhilarated by the excitement of the day , I picked her up and showed her a good time by spinning her around in a heady fox-trot . JeanBaptiste came in . " You can dance ! " he exclaimed . The other boys listened in admiration to the daring of their hero . I put the baby down and presented myself . It was a serious amusement . Aside from the impropriety of talking much to the ladies , the dancing is too vigorous for leisurely conversation , and your partner never knows quite what he is going to do next , so you have to keep your mind pretty firmly on what you are doing , in order to avoid injury . And you ca n't go by the music very well either , because when there are only two records , they have to serve all purposes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk and dance at the same time ; he was an adventurous young man who often went on pretended errands down to the stock ranches , and watched the American boys out of his keen brown eyes , and learned things from them . He learned how to dress in red-and-green-striped silk shirts with soft collars and knotted neckerchiefs ; and though he never rode , he wore woolly chaps in the hottest weather when he plowed the fields ; he had a big green beaver hat , very hot-looking but gorgeous , and with it all he had kept the innocent Belgian eyes that made you admire him in spite of yourself . The older people looked on him with dread . He filled the china-blue eyes of the girls , even though they turned their heads away from temptation ; the boys admired him helplessly , and timidly followed where he led . Juliette was not altogether kind to her countrymen . Girls have a great advantage over boys in the learning of new ways , and they are not slow to recognize their superiority . Every square mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every man knew that in the little Belgian community there were girls with placid blue eyes and yellow hair ; and every girl had all the attention from regular men that she could well take care of in the limited amount of time at her disposal . So she learned with marvelous rapidity American ways and American speech and American dress , and affected a gentle tolerance or intolerance , according to the little variations in her temperament , of the quaintness of her own people . The boys were very humble . They had no one to teach them ; the American men did n't have time to , and the American girls were too busy . Of course , there was a teacher occasionally , but the Belgians had always had men before I came , and the men teachers were naturally more interested in the education of the girls . I was sorry for the boys . One of them would go to Juliette and ask her to dance . " You ca n't dance , " she would say , tossing her yellow curls disdainfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Juliette says I ca n't dance . " " But you can , " I 'd assure him , and to prove it , I would let him dance with me . All radiant , he 'd go back to Juliette . " I can dance , " he 'd tell her . " Teacher says I can . " " But you ca n't , " she 'd repeat , and his poor , simple brain would whirl in bewilderment . I had said he could , and it must be so because I was the teacher ; but Juliette had said he could not , and that was certainly so because she was Juliette . We had a lovely time through the harvest ; there was a great deal to do on the Belgians ' farms , because there was not only the immense yield of grain , but great quantities of hay from the unplowed fields and all the berries and peanuts and fruit . The ranchmen had all their hay up and were already driving their stock in from the summer range before we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting around their fires telling what a " helluva " country it had become since the range was gone , while the Belgians were out sowing the grain . It was a marvel to me to go by the great farms which we had always turned over to the range stock and see these primitive peasants walking stolidly along with a bag slung over a shoulder and a steady hand moving back and forth , scattering seed exactly as they have always done in the penny prints we show to children . You 'd have to know the Bad Lands truly to know the miracle of these Belgian farms . You get off the train at Big Sandbar , where there was a river once before it dried up , and you do n't see a speck of green , or the shade of a tree ; as far as the eye can reach are only the great bare wastes of sand and sagebrush , with the dark shadows of the coulees that break the surface of the land into those ungovernable hillocks . You drive hour after hour through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer for settlement ? pass the ragged holdings of a ranch man who ranges his cattle miles away ? no water , no vegetation ? sand and sagebrush . All around the Big Sandbar land was taken up and settlements made and abandoned , and the country reeled back into the wilderness from which it came ; stockmen found better places with more water and sacrificed quantity of cattle to quality . Then some Belgians living far back east heard that the government would give them six hundred and forty acres of land only for the asking . Think of six hundred and forty acres to a family that had lived in little Belgium ! They hurried into this paradise . Their astonished eyes saw thousands and thousands of acres stretched out , such marvelous land , all for the asking ! Oh , dear , I love my wild state ! It 's so big and relentless and so perfectly able to take care of itself ! Certain weakling states that I 've read about have let themselves be ravaged by ignorant and improvident men , but not mine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honored and treated with servile deference ; it 's a king-state . Well ! that 's the kind of wooers she got when the Belgians came . They did n't break their hearts over her cruelty . They had ages of soil-love in them , and they were willing to put up with her wild ways . They fenced each six hundred and forty acres and built a house ; plowed forty acres and built a barn ; dammed up a coulee and bought a cow . They were so simple and matter-of-fact ! The stockmen petitioned congress for an irrigation system , and continued to drive their cattle miles away to the water holes , while they waited ; but the Belgians dammed up the coulees on their ranches and let the water collect in great . drinking pools . The second summer they plowed another forty and let the first lie fallow . They moved the wheat field every fall to a new quarter-section , and plowed the clover under ? all such simple things to do ! They loved the land . Women tended it and nursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of women working in fields , and peasants are alluring . When American women work out of doors they put on overalls , and they generally have short hair and wide hats , and look hideous ; but the peasants move about in their long skirts with their bright kerchiefs tied over their heads and their hair in hard little knots , and look like masterpieces . They loved even the rocks on their farms . You know the things ranchmen say about rocks ! But the Belgians picked up all their rocks and saved them , laid them in neat piles and then carted them up to the buildings to snake warm chicken houses in which grateful chickens laid twice as many eggs as usual . They saved the biggest and best rocks for the church . The upper part of the church was of wood , and it had a brave high steeple , but the foundation was of carefully fitted big bowlders , selected with a devotion that was touching and beautiful . Always after harvest the boys painted the church . The entire surface was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men for the chance to paint these sections . Happy was the man who drew the steeple ! He was a man of importance and could move with a self-assertion denied to other men . It was he who , in the courage born of an honorable position , danced with me the last night of the harvest festival and told me about it . I promised that I would come out on the following day to see him paint the steeple , and he was confused and shy in his happiness . I 1 should have gone anyway ; for where but in the primitive wilderness could you see so quaint a sight as eleven men with eleven buckets of paint all arriving at a given moment , each to paint his section of a little spire-pointed church , to pray in his heart that he be not too proud , and to go away again all glad and thankful that a great blessing had come to Dien ? I sat on the fence of the school yard with the children and watched the painting , and we stayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a tribute in the nature of a devotional exercise . And when the men had finished , they shouldered their ladders and walked away without looking at us . Well , the next dance we had JeanBaptiste danced with me as usual , and then sat beside me to talk a little , although this was not at all a proper thing to do , and the older people looked askance and the younger ones breathless at the temerity of him . I said to him , " Jean-Baptiste , you were not lucky ; you did not draw a section of the church to paint . " He looked at me startled . I saw that I had said something wrong , but I did not know how to recede . " You are so lucky about everything else , " I continued , " I thought surely you would draw one of the chances . " He twisted his hands , nervously . " I ? I did n't draw ! " he stammered . " Rut why ? " I insisted . " Does n't everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and moved away . I had asked too much . Almost immediately Juliette came and sat down beside me . Well , Juliette would know . I plunged into the subject . Her placid blue eyes swam suddenly in tears . " Oh , Jean-Baptiste does n't belong ! " her subdued cry was a wail of grief . " And that is why of everything ! He does n't belong ! " Always and always the cry of disconsolate lovers ! But oh , surely in so big a space as ours it did n't matter much ! Juliette began to come to the schoolhouse . Now that she had told me so much it was easy to tell me more . They 'd loved each other long and hopelessly , ever so long , because Jean-Baptiste was so different from the other men , so talkative and polite like an American , that she could n't help loving him ; ever so hopelessly because ? he did n't belong he came from the southern country ; no church , no God , no family , so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must marry the man her father had picked out . " But you ca n't do that ! " I exclaimed . " That is n't the way people marry . You marry the man you love , of course . " She looked at me Ut. astonishment . VOL . CXLVII. - NO. 880. - 69 " But my father says ' no ' ! " " Well , what if he does ? " " You would marry a mitn when your father says ' no ' ? " " My father would n't say no ' ; you 're supposed to marry the man you love ! " She shook her head with a slow smile . " You are a teacher , " she said , with the deference due to official rank , " and I would not . say you do not know ; hu t ? you have been mis-in-formed . " The Belgians were very sweet on the subjects whereon we disagreed . They would not tolerate any teaching adverse to their own ; but they would not say I did not know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise ; but in this she has been mis-in-formed ! " Jean-Baptiste knew at once that Juliette had been to me ; and he came after that with passionate pleadings for my help . There was every reason why he should have had Juliette because he was heir to a splendid farm already broken up into plowed fields , where under his mother 's hands the poppies had given way to pansies and hollyhocks , and the apple trees had long since begun to bear ; whereas Brockveig was one of five or six sons , and would have to go farther out into the desert and break for himself a new farm . Brockveig was very shy and humble ; he knew quite well that Juliette was much too far above him , but he never dreamed of questioning the fate that selected her for him ; he accepted her with meek gratitude , and plowed up his land patiently , and had a great building party out at the new homestead when the community harvesting was done . We all went . I made them some lovely marshmallow cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quaint , and laughed merrily at the conceit . Juliette and Jean-Baptiste clung to my side as though I had the power to change all this . I talked to them a lot about it ; I told Juliette she should n't let Brockveig go on with his building , and I told Jean-Baptiste that he should take Juliette in spite of everybody ; but I knew very well my words did n't ring true , and they were not deceived . When you undertake to solve people 's problems you must be quite sure of what you are doing ; and I was not sure . Juliette could not stop the building ; Jean-Baptiste could not carry her off . At that , there was an uneasiness , an unrest , in the little colony . I could see it in the faces of the older people as they looked at us . They were gentle people , and full of the love of the land and the law ; they revered me as a representative of the law , and what . I did was right . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they did was right also . Jean-Baptiste did not belong ; therefore , he must not have Juliette . Was it not plain ? Oh , so very plain ! But still , I had influence . I am not quite sure just how much power I had ? the Belgians were in America in order to become Americans ; that was never in doubt . They would study me , and learn from me ; many of them approved ? of me . I wondered just how long it would take to win the approval of all of them ? sometimes you can do it . I saw Juliette 's father looking at me sometimes with an expression of doubt , and it did n't take a great deal of cleverness to see the birth of a great conflict behind the placid eyes . There was a thing he might do to save his child from me . Should he do it ? Nobody had ever done such a thing before ? it was almost a sacrilege ? there was nothing in the prayer-book about it ? but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A government that had given him six hundred and forty acres of such wonderful land and sent them wise and noble teachers to make them Americans ! I 'm sure you can see the conflict that tore the heart of the father of Juliette . He must save his child , and if there were no other way , then he must commit this sin . It was decided for him in this way : You know how suddenly the blizzards come up where we live . Maybe you 're right in the midst of haying on a pleasant October day , and all of a sudden a wind whirls up out of the north , and flings a handful of snow through the air with a blindness , a stinging violence , which shatters the grain and stampedes the cattle , and tosses the calves into the creeks . Well , such a blizzard came up , only a handful of snow , but a wind as wild as all hell 's fury ; there was n't enough snow to fling , so it picked up sand and pebbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children laughed and clapped their hands , and ran in an out for the fun of being pelted ; we were all bruised when we got home from school . But that did n't matter . When the storm was over , some one went down to open up the church and see that all was well there , and oh dear , oh dear , every window was broken ! A pall fell on the village . The wrath of God had descended ! God had forsaken his own ! I think that was why Juliette 's father was driven to his sin . If God was angry with his people it was because they had done wrong , and the only wrong of which they were aware was that one of their children looked with desire on a man who did not belong . So Juliette 's father came secretly to the schoolhouse and stole the dictionary ! Do n't laugh at us ! He thought the dictionary was the bulwark of the school ? and that by removing this bulwark he was destroying the root of temptation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over to see Juliette 's mother on Saturday ; the storm was over and the weather was lovely . Rocks were flying in the newest forty next to the fence , and I thought there were at least six men working , so I slid by unobtrusively , but when I had almost got by , she called to me . She was picking them up with both hands , throwing them accurately onto piles which she was gathering for a pig-run . She was having a pleasant time , but she stopped work politely to go up to the house with me . I did n't stay very long . I saw that both Juliette and her mother were uneasy and a little terrified ; and Juliette 's tranquil eyes were full of a dumb misery . I asked Juliette to walk on a little with me after we 'd had our cake and coffee and she did , but she told me nothing . When we said good-by , she held out her hands to me . " You have been good to me , " she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say you will forgive ine . If you must go out in the winter because of tile , only say you will forgive me ! " " I wo n't be going out , " I assured her ; " and how could I forgive one who has done me no harm ? " " But I will pray for you , " she promised , " and perhaps I shall be given the wisdom to know what to do ! " I thanked her gravely and we parted . The children were restless on Monday : I saw that something had happened , but I did not know what . When I released them at recess they gathered in knots , and talked excitedly in their own language . They hung about a little at four o'clock , and presently one of them came to me , and asked , " Do we have school still yet ? " " To-morrow , " I replied absently . He rushed out with the news . They were plainly puzzled . Juliette 's little sister Rosalie came hack after the others were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without saying anything . I was not impatient . Things always adjust themselves , and this would too . But I was a little curious . It was not till Wednesday that I had occasion to send some one to the Unabridged . He stood up , his eyes as big as moons . " The big dictionary , " I repeated . " Miss Teacher , no " he stammered . I looked at him inquiringly . His eyes turned to the dictionary stand . Mine followed . The dictionary was not there ! " Where is the dictionary ? " I cried . There was a relieved outpouring of words . Nobody had dared to tell me before this because of the uncertainty of the law , but now they told me . Juliette 's father had taken away the dictionary because God was angry with his people . Nov how could we have school any more ? I bowed my head in my hands . Dramatic occasions call for dramatic presentation . The children waited breathlessly . Suddenly I looked up . " Bit . no ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be hard for us to learn the American words without a dictionary . But see ! We have the flag ! Whenever we have the flag we have school , even without the dictionary ! " So we all went outside and put up the flag , which I had forgotten to do that morning , and we sang the Star-Spangled Banner , and made a great deal of the matter . The children were very much relieved . School is a meeting place for children in the Bad Lands , and they are always restless and unhappy when there is n't any , because it is usually lonesome at home . I was n't quite sure what to do about the dictionary . If I went over and demanded it it would probably be given me , but it would be far better to have it restored voluntarily . I thought about it a long time , and the upshot of it was that I did n't do anything . I never do . As long as a thing is something of a game , without very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend that I 'm managing affairs , and righting wrongs , and adjusting difficulties ; but when it 's a real complication I 'd rather let it worry along until it untangles itself : it 's safer that way . Brockveig went on with his building , hi spite of snow and cold , and Juliette 's mother wove linen sheets and wool blankets . Jean-Baptiste spread manure over his fields and tended his stock . It was a prosperous community and a happy One . School went on , but the tragedy of the dictionary still stayed with us . I pretended that we 'd suffered an irreparable loss , though really we had n't made much use of it , except for the little children to stand on when they could n't reach the blackboard . " But some day , " I told the children , " if we are very patient and good , the dictionary will come back to us , and then we shall learn its words all the faster . " Juliette 's father dropped his eyes when he passed me . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't proper , but he moved now under a great weight of guilt . And now the house was done , and the barns , and sheets and blankets were woven , and Juliette had a new brown dress , very serviceable and un-American , though she had copied it out of a mailorder catalog ; and there was a great baking and brewing in all the houses . Everybody made feasts and parties , and we went from house to house celebrating and giving gifts . Jean-Baptiste came , too . He did not speak much to Juliette , but their eyes found each other and spoke for them . It was quaintly sad , not the poignant , bitter misery that civilized people endure , but a plaintive breath of piteousness like that of a poem or picture . " Juliette , " I said , " you are n't going to marry Brockveig ? Surely you wo n't leave Jean-Baptiste alone ? " She raised her astonished blue eyes . " But what else can I do ? " she asked . " Has not my father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see ! When I have done what is right the dictionary will come back to you ! " And so she was married . Brockveig was very happy , in his big , stolid way ; he had a new blue shirt for the wedding , and a new American suit that contrasted oddly with his bright blond brawn ; and I sang them a wedding song which was partly happy and partly sad . Jean-Baptiste dropped his dark head in his hands when everybody prayed , and you would not have guessed that lie did not belong . After church we all went out to the new house . We walked along the bare road , a party of merry villagers , laughing and chatting because of the happiness of a new home . The winter wheat was sown ; the coulees were dammed up to make drinking holes ; and another six hundred and forty acres were reclaimed out of the wilderness . Surely , you see it could n't have been any different ? I could have claimed the dictionary in the name of the law ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the free gift of a grateful ally . And I might have saved the hearts of Juliette and Jean-Baptiste by long insistence on the superior wisdom of American ways ; but that would have been meddling in affairs I know nothing about .. I thanked Juliette for bringing the dictionary back to me . " You have done a great thing for America , " I said . But I did n't mean the dictionary , though she thought I did . I was seeing another generation of precious peasantry ; another stretch of emerald fields ; another vindication of my noble north . That 's why I ask you to remember about the poppies . They have n't the fragrance of roses , or the delicacy of orchids , or the piquancy of pansies . No housewife would take them into the parlor for ornament ; no lover would send them to his bride . But they fill the desert with color ! They 're the promise of crops and homes !                 @ @ @ @
