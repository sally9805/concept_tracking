All other parliamentary business was overshadowed by Philip Snowden 's bill against capitalism . In a few words , it is an evolutionary elimination of the capitalist system . There was nothing revolutionary about Snowden 's speech ; he picked out the flaws in the present system and advocated a remedy in general terms . <P> Sir Alfred Mond took the floor against him . The gist of Sir Alfred 's remarks was that it is easy to pick holes in any system . He accused the laborites of using economic language too vaguely . The bill will come up again for discussion after the Easter recess . <P> Snowden is a labor member of Parliament , and author of several books on socialism . He is a determined and intelligent man , and can in no sense be termed a fanatic .
