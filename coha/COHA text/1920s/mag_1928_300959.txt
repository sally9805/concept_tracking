HARNESS-A . Hamilton Gibbs*-Little Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> Michael Gordon is the ideal husband-brilliant war record , handy about the house , shaggy tweeds , chugging pipe . He worships his wife , aids and abets her stage career . They find a storybook cottage-thatch roof , rambler roses , flagstones-he settles down to his writing , she commutes to her London theatre . Every midnight he meets her in the two-seater , serves her supper at the blazing hearth , listens to her footlight triumphs . In short , he is so thoroughbred that she succumbs to the illicit blandishments of the leading man in her show . Fond Michael , suddenly informed , spoils the matine idol 's beauty with a black eye and bloody nose . The wife repents . <P> Charmingly written , Harness develops poignantly a man 's fine emotion , sympathetically a woman 's illogical but inevitable reaction . <P> <P> * A. Hamilton Gibbs and Philip Gibbs are brothers .                   @ @
