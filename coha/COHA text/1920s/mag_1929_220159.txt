The first printed code of orthodox Jewish life was published a quarter-century after the Gutenberg Bible ( 1452 ) . It was Rabbi Jacob ' ben Asher 's famed Arba Turim ( Code of the Jews ) . For five centuries it disappeared from the sight of orthodox Jews . Lately it was found in Italy bearing on its Hebraic pages three visas of papal inquisitioners who had examined it for heresies . Last week it was taken to Manhattan and placed in the Jewish Theological Seminary . It was purchased with funds ( of concealed volume ) donated by Theatrical Producer Abraham Lincoln Erlanger.
