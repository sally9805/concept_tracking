For some time the Russian Soviet Government has had as its Minister to Poland whilom aristocratic Prince Obolensky . Although he has several times resigned , his resignations have never been accepted . Last week , however , his Government accommodated him by ordering his recall , allegedly for failing to conceal the propaganda and espionage work of the Warsaw Soviet Legation . <P> Consequent upon the recall of Minister Obolensky , the Soviet Government enquired of the Polish Government if Peter Voikov , who had accompanied Lenin and Trotzky from Switzerland to Russia in 1917 , would be persona grata . As Peter had planned and carried out the infamous execution of the late Imperial Family , the Polish Government hesitated to accept him . The Polish press saw in the incident an affront to the Nation .
