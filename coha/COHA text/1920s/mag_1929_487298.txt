THE bad-roads movement which the Drifter has man  --  gurated is meeting with nation-wide acclaim . That is to say , two readers have written that they are in favor of it , and any press agent who ca n't translate two read  --  ers into " nation-wide acclaim " is n't worthy of his hire . The Drifter 's multitudinous correspondence comes from as far away as California , whence a writer who signs herself " fervently and forever for bad roads " tells of acquiring a house in an un  --  spoiled fishing village on the coast . At first the house was adequately protected against invasion by a breastwork of " divinely bad " roads , but real-estate promoters have arrived , a concrete highway is under construction  --  and the house is for sale . Another warm supporter of the bad-roads move  --  ment arises in  --  of all places ! ? Chicago . The Drifter had supposed that good roads were essential around the Midwest metropolis in order that residents might conveniently carryabout with them the machine-guns necessary for the local pastime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago correspondent writes : Your low whisper for converts to join a bad-roads movement will be heard even in the wilderness of more and more cars and still more miles of concrete , and you 're bound to start something . As one who has had his fling at automotive transportation  --  having had three motor  --  cycles and eight cars in my time , and traveled in twenty-six States ? I have been without a car for three years now and find my greatest pleasure on unused roads ( though there are few of them left in this country ) . The point is that since good roads and motor cars go hand in hand , you will have to make flank attacks on both . To argue bad roads alone would n't convince many . We 've got to stop making and selling so many cars , and if we can get in here , we know that bad roads will naturally follow because there wo n't be any gas tax or State license money with which to build roads . Economists and industrialists can be as horrified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ? ) is built on the foundation of good roads and motor cars . I , for one , am going out to convert people to bad roads and no motor cars . THE Drifter is not so ambitious as that  --  or quite so unpractical . Nobody recognizes better than he the abuses associated with the automobile . But he also knows that the time to attack the automobile was a quarter of a century ago when it had not yet been woven into our living habits and before it had arrived in the business world as an enormous vested interest . The Drifter surmises that if the automobile had come as a poor man 's convenience instead of a rich man 's toy its history would have been different . It is one of the splendid ironies of life in New York City that the New York Central freight trains which crawl through Eleventh Avenue are required to send a man on horseback ahead of the locomotive ; and lumbering steam rollers which smooth out newly laid pavement at about four miles an hour must be preceded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are permitted to dash along Broadway at thirty or forty miles an hour without the benefit even of a cowcatcher to toss the pedestrian out of the way . NO , the Drifter does not envisage the suppression  --  or even adequate regulation  --  of the automobile by the mere pedestrian , but he does think that car drivers are them  --  selves going to demand , and obtain , relief from the existing congestion of the roads . In the meantime taxicabs will tend to displace private cars in our large cities , while motor buses may work a similar change in the country . The general manager of the New York Automobile Club has just issued a suggestion that private cars should not be used for Christ  --  mas shopping . And as the Drifter wrote the other day , motoring as a sport is giving way to flying . The village of Radburn has already been laid out in New Jersey by the City Housing Corporation with separate , non-intersecting routes for motor cars and walkers . The Drifter 's bad-roads movement is intended to make certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedes  --  trians , horseback riders , and bicycles . The latter means of travel might then achieve a merited rejuvenation . THE DRIFTER
