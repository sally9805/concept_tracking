At La Scala , in Milan , Arturo Toscanini conducted a new opera by Ildebrando Pizzetti . Its story , taken from a mediaeval monk 's chronicle , was that of " a young Parman of low birth , layman , idiot , and fool , " one Gherardhino Segarello , whose reckless career of devotion and debauchery caused him to be put in jail , led out only to amuse guests when the Bishop of Parma gave a banquet . Pizzetti had chosen to make a martyr of this squalid clown , to endow his dishonorable poverty with Franciscan splendor . <P> In Fra Gherardo , the poor Parman is a religious rebel who gives all his money to the poor and dares combat with the Church of Rome . He is not , however , entirely a saint . His lusts lead him to betray a sympathetic virgin who later returns to help him conduct his holy reforms . Gherardo , veering like a mediaeval Elmer Gantry between his passion for this girl and his passion for reform , is led at last to betray his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this effort he fails . He watches her being strangled and is then carried off to be put on the fire . <P> Such is the tragic tale which Pizzetti has adorned with perhaps the most splendid music of his career . The opera was undoubtedly too long and it seemed to contain a superfluity of dialogue , of inactive interludes that were only vaguely melodic . Lyrical passages were few . Fra Gherardo was original mainly for its orchestration and for the thunderous , muttering chorus which reached its climax in a mob scene at the end of the third act . These choruses were unlike anything that Milanese operagoers had ever seen before . There was something terrible and true in that imitation of the angry shouted songs of many men together , songs sweeping with strong steadiness through a range of cruelty and fear . <P> Ildebrando Pizzetti was born in Parma and he has honored it before this in , for example , his Ildebrando da Parma . He studied at the Conservatory of Parma for six years , specializing in the model qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the Florence Conservatory . In Florence he lives now in almost ratlike retirement . His wife , a descendant of Stradivarius , is dead . He likes quiet and hates traveling ; he was made sorrowful before the War when his enemies , on account of his " revolutionary " music , made him the object of belligerent slander . His most famed work previous to Fra Gherardo was Debora e Jaele , an opera about a Hebrew prophetess in which , as in the more recent work , Pizzetti made frequent use of a crowded stage and made his score the incentive for action rather than its purpose .
