Herewith are excerpts from letters come to the desks of the editors during the past week . They are selected primarily for the information they contain , either supplementary to , or corrective of , news previously published in TIME . <P> Facts <P> Muskogee , Okla . <P> Jan. 12 , 1924 <P> TIME <P> New York , N. Y. <P> Gentlemen : In speaking of the death of Alvin Sherman Wheaton , TIME , Dec. 29 , 1924 , p. 32 , you say there are but two men living who witnessed the assassination of Lincoln . I saw it stated in Forbes Magazine that Robert Lincoln witnessed this event ; and also the assassination of McKinley and Garfield . What are the facts ? <P> W. DUNLAP . <P> P. S. How old is Robert Lincoln ? Where does he live ? <P> According to Nicolay and Hay 's Abraham Lincoln , crowds rushed from the theatre after the assassination to the White House , burst " through the doors , shouted the dreadful news to Robert Lincoln and Major Hay , who sat gossiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1843 , Robert Lincoln lives at No. 3014 N. Street N. W. , Washington , D. C.-ED . <P> Lauds Independent <P> Cleveland , Ohio <P> Jan. 5 , 1925 <P> TIME , INC. , New York , N. Y. <P> Gentlemen : <P> This seems to be the open season for writing letters to TIME about errors in its colnmns , and reading the letters of other subscribers incites me to write one , although I have no particular error to which I wish to call attention . Once in a while I see one and feel like writing to you about it and then am too lazy , and find ultimately that it was not important enough to make a fuss about or that somebody else has written you about it . <P> My real reason for writing is to say how much I appreciate TIME after several months ' reading of it . I am amused occasionally at some of the criticisms of other subscribers- the most amusing being those by someone whose ox has apparently been gored . I do not recall any weekly magazine , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever given so good a digest of current news , except , in a measure , The Independent , a number of years ago when it ran a weekly department of about eight pages in which it digested the week 's news , but even it was not so good as TIME because it contained no expression of editorial opinion and was rather dry . <P> I want especially to congratulate whoever it is who writes your book reviews and theatrical criticisms . He succeeds , ( or they succeed , as the case may be ) , in making the criticisms more interesting , frequently , than the thing criticized , and , contrary to the gentleman who writes you from Havana , Cuba , whose letter is quoted in today 's number of TIME , I especially enjoy your Sports Department . That may be because I have no particular interest in sports and therefore like to have them written about in a semi-humorous way .
