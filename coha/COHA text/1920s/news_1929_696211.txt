txt In a report in which it depicted the country as enjoying an era of unprecedented prosperity- , with living standards at a higher level than in any former time , the Committee on Recent Economic Changes in the United States , of which President Hoover Is chairman , declared today that the " out-1 standing fact " illuminated by its survey was that " we can not maintain our economic advantage , or hope fully to realize on our economic future , unless we consciously accept the principle of equilibrium and applyit skillfully in every economic relation . " The warning note was contained in the concluding section of the report , ' in which the committee cited waste ' of natural resources , the transfer of I credit in quantity from production tol speculation and artificial price ad-1 vancement , as developments which would tend to destroy the economic stability which it declared to be a chief factor in the national prosperity it found in the period of 1922 to 1929 , covered by the report . " Until recently , " the report said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation , " and had maintained a degree of balance between the economic forces which has enabled the intricate machine of present-day America to produce and serve our people . " Informed leadership is vital to the maintenance of equilibrium , " the committee said . " Through incessant observation and adjustment of our economy , we can learn to maintain the economic balance . " New Economic Services Developed . In leading up to these conclusions , the report painted a picture of a country that had ceased to be " concerned about the primary needs , food , clothing and shelter , " and by reaching out for other luxuries , among them the radio , the automobile and electrical household appliances , had by its demands for service made possible the expansion of new industries that provided employment for thousands . A situation apparently has been developed , the report said , where new wants would make way for newer wants as fast as they were satisfied . " We seem only to have touched the fringe of our potentialities , " it added . The committee which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is a continuation of the President 's Conference on Unemployment of 1921-22 , which was called by the late President Harding and over which Mr. Hoover , then Secretary of Commerce , presided . The present committee is composed of President Hoover , Postmaster General Walter F. Brown , Renick W. Dunlap , President Greene of the American Federation of Labor , Julius Klein , Assistant Secretary of Commerce ; John S. Lawrence , Max Mason , George , Adolph C. Miller of the Federal Reserve Board , Lewis E. Pierson , John J. Raskob , Arch W. Shaw , Louis J. Taber , Daniel Willard , Clarence H. Woolley , Owen D. Young and Edward Eyre Hunt , secretary of the body . A foreword to the report stated that President Hoover was unable to take part in the lztor deliberation of the een -- -iiiee and Mr. Shaw served as acting chairman . It is understood , however , that Mr. Hoover has maintained close contact with the work of preparing the report . While he was in the South after his election . a subcommittee called upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred economists . statisticians and sociologists aided the committee in the research work , under the direction of the National Bureau of Economic Research . The compiling of data was completed and the conclusions reached late in February of this year , and the task of making the final draft of the report was then begun . In : view of the efforts that have been made by the Federal Reserve Board tO ' check the flow of capital into , speculative activities in the stock market . any reference by the committee to the Reserve System has been awaited with interest . This reference is found in a section devoted to " The Spread in the Source and Use of Credit . " After asserting that the activities of investors and speculators had brought about a situation where " a credit stringency. resulting in an abnormally high rate for call money and an appreciable increase in the rate of interest for business purposes " was indicated , the committee said : " Imports of gold early in the period covered by the survey which tended to make credit easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the popular confidence in the financial structure , especially in the Federal Reserve System , and the power of the system to move available credit to the places where it is needed , mark a great advance during these seven years . " The committee found that industrial development had been more rapid in the Pacific States . the South and the East North Central division . with the New England States and to some extent the Middle Atlantic section growing less rapidly . Industrial , agricultural and commercial activity was found to be " spl ) tty. " but . nevertheless , the committee Aaid4 " the broad . social advantages 94 our accelerated activity flowed out over the land . " Electric power was found to have increased three and three-quarters times faster than the growth in population , with the United States now using as much electrical energy as all the rest of the world combined . A rising wage scale , with steady or lowered costs of commodities , was found to be one of the outstanding phenomena of the new industrial era . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " we have become consumers of what we produce to an extent never before realized . " The increased use of machines in manufacturing , the committee said , had , notwithstanding the reductions in the hours of labor , increased the per capita productivity by nearly 60 per cent . This development had in turn caused " technical unemployment , " a problem which must be met in order to forestall hardship and uncertainty in the lives of the workers . But the committee found a development of major importance in a realization by industry that leisure for the employe helped to create new needs and new and broader markets . A New Philosophy Applied . " An evolution which has been g  --  iLig 19X- Aeatliag-3 4tY4 cAlY , te. - . cently been revealed as a mass movement , " it said . " We now apply to many kinds of services the philosophy of large-scale production . We have integrated these services and organized them , and we have developed the new philosophy to such degree in recent years that we now have what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a new standard of living in the United States , and have afforded employment for millions of - workers I crowded out of agriculture and the extractive fabricating industries . " It was , in fact , the timely de-1 velopment of ' mass services ' which saved our country from a critical unemployment problem during recent years . " " Few of the current economic de-1 velopments , " the committee coneluded. " have made such widespread changes in our national life or promise so much for the future as the utilization of our increasing leisure . " I Outline of Chapter Surveys .
