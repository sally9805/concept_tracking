Last year there were 22,000,000 hungry Russians whom the Soviet Government did not have grain enough to keep alive . The American Relief Association came to their rescue , and fed many of the starving . This year the American Relief Administration estimates there will be 13,000,000 hungry mouths that Russia can not feed . <P> " Extremely unfortunate , " says the Soviet government ; " we have not enough farm implements or livestock to till the grain field . " Then the American attach at Berlin reports : The German government has bought 1,400,000 bushels of wheat from Russia . It is about to be shipped from Black Sea ports . Further reports indicate that thousands of tons of grain are being exported over the Finnish border and from Odessa and Novorossysk on the Black Sea . There can be but one conclusion-that the Soviet government prefers exporting grain to feeding its starving peasants . <P> This policy is slowly leading ten or fifteen million people-among them three million children-towards certain starvation . Accordingly the American Relief Association is between the devil and the deep sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for America with the cries of three million starving ringing in their ears . Or they can remain to energize a nation which is financially fattening itself by exporting the life blood of its people . Either alternative is inhuman .
