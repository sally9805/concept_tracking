Prohibition , he said , had worked great good both to the Ford Industries and their employes . " ' Prohibition , ' he continued , ' has reduced the liquor problem , so far as it relates to our men , to a point where we can easily handle it - Before prohibition there were in each group of 5,000 men about 100 who gave us trouble because of the liquor they drank . Now in each group of 5,000 there are not more than ten whose tendency to drink makes us trouble . There are not ten  --  ten is too high a figure . " ' Before prohibition , ' said Mr. Ford .

When a man lays off a day or two we think nothing about , it. - As a result of prohibition our men are working more , working oetter , wasting less and saving more . Now when we raise a. man 's pay we know the increase will go to his wife or to his savings account instead of to a- saloonkeeper .

They would lay off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half that many are absent now , and investigation has disclosed that they remain away ? not because they have been drinking , but for a variety of other reasons . - Quotes Judge Gary . " Again face the facts , liquor gentlemen . Face Judge Gary of the United States Steel Corporation . You will perhaps concede that he , too , knows something about industry in this country . Ask him if he subscribes to the statement that nobody knows what has been the effect of prohibition upon industry . Read the statement that Judge Gary authorized Allen Benson to make in his behalf : ' " I have no hesitancy in saying with emphasis that the Volstead act and State laws for prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors have been very beneficial to the industry of this country and to the workmen connected with it and their families . " ' I would not favor the modifitation of the law to permit the manufacture and sale of light wines and beer . " ' I made a statement about prohibition three years ago that states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent information and present conditions . I said then , and I repeat now , that while there have been violations of these laws , particularly in the larger cities , yet as a total result of the prohibitory laws there has been a large decrease in the use of liquor , at least in the vicinity of our various plants throughout the country . There has been a noteworthy decrease in the number of jails , asylums and hospitals . There has been an increase , and a large increase , in the bank balances of savings deposits . The health of the people has Improved . " ' That families of workmen are better clothed and better treated . The attendance of the workmen and their families at church , of the children In schools and of all of them at clean , legitimate , healthful resorts and places of- amusements has materially increased . " ' The sale and use of automobiles has been largely increased by the fact that a large majority of the workmen now prefer to . take excursions with their families by automobile instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wasting their money in practices that are physically injurious instead of beneficial . " ' At a meeting of steel men recently it was stated by one of those present that the families of the workmen in the steel mills would vote . with practicalunanimity in favor of total prohibition , although some of the husbands might perhaps be in favor of the sale of light beer and wines . " ' All in all , however , there is no doubt that a large preponderance of the workmen of this country are in favor of the prhibition of the sale and use of all intoxicants , from the standpoint of good morals , good economics and peaceful social relations . ' Gives View of John D. Rockefeller Jr . " ' There has been a very general impression , ' said a statement issued by authority of John D. Rockefeller Jr .. ' that the effect of prohibition has been a great increase in the savings of the men and a general improvement of their'morale . ' " W. E. Storey , President of the Atchison , Topeka &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long had a rule against drinking . We feel , ' he continued , ' that there has been less drinking among our rank and file since the prohibition law went into effect , although there Is still a great deal of bootlegging . ' " ' As far as our industry is concerned , ' said George M. Verity , President of the American Rolling- Mill Company of Middletown , Ohio , ' prohibition has been 100 per cent . effective . It has ceased to be a problem on the inside of industry . ' " H. B. Smith , Secretary and Treasurer of the Steel Company , Ltd. , of Corry . Pa. , put it this way : ' Prohibition has given us better employes , and they are more interested in their some life and their children and take more of an interest in civic affairs ' " W. T. Beatty , President of the Austin Manufacturing Company , Chicago : ' The effect of prohibition upon our employes has been most wonderful . ' " R. H. Scott , President of- the Reo Motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had prohibition there is no difference between the day after pay-day and the day before . We have no trouble whatever because of employes who fail to report because of drunkenness . The American working men do not want booze , and it la an injustice to them to say that they are opposed to prohibition . It may be true that foreign-born working men insist upon having intoxicating liquor , but our company has almost 100 per cent . American workingmen ' " Harry EL . Willock , Waverly 011 Works Company , Pittsburgh , Pa. : ' There has been a tremendous betterment among our employes , due to prohibition . ' Says Employes Are Better Clothed . " David D. Lupton , Vice President of David Lupton 's Sons Company , Philadelphia : " ' Our employes are better fed and clothed now than they were before the prohibition law was enacted . The majority are enjoying life on a scale that was before impossible . Seldom do we find men with even the appearance of being in liquor , whereas formerly not a day passed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ars fewer accidents- and greater efficiency . ' " J. J. Phoenix , President of the Bradley Knitting Company , Delevan , Wis. : " ' The effects of prohibition upon the employes of this company have been uniformly beneficial : Efficiency is higher , earnings are larger , the employes are more punctual in appearing for work , average work is better with a slight decrease in seconds and defective products , the labor turnover is less and there is a happier and more contented attitude toward the job and society . In general , the workers have benefited more largely from prohibition than any other part of our population . ' " ' I am satisfied , ' says William A. Vawter , President of the Baker-yawter Company of Benton Harbor , Mich. , ' that prohibition has been a good thing for our employes , and the merchants here tell me that it has not only increased their business with the workingmen but has enabled them to do a larger volume of business in shorter hours . The efficiency of our workingmen is now at the highest point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good effects of this law , ' says - . J. $ , Bachmann , superintendent of the Anchor Duck Mills of Rome , Ga. , ' have been such that we would not for anything return to the old method of licensing the sale of intoxicating liquors . ' Declares " Bine Mondays " Gone . " There can be no question , ' says Mr. Arthur R. Baxter of the Keyless Lock Company of Indianapolis , ' as to the effect that prohibition has had upon the health of workingmen , their regularity in reporting for duty and their efficiency . We- no longer have " blue Mondays " or men off for long periods because of drink . The effect has not only been good , but remarkably good . ' " Mr. James R. Risk , Treasurer of the Dairy Cream Separator Company of Lebanon , Ind. , says : ' Prohibition has greatly benefited industry everywhere ; it is the greatest economic reform that our nation has ever experienced . ' " ' The effect of prohibition upon our employes , ' says Mr. W. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been beneficial . ' " ' From the standpoint of the manufacturer , ' says Mr. John W. Sibley of the Birmingham ( Ala . ) Clay Products Company , ' prohibition has been of incalculable benefit because of the increased efficiency of labor , the better quality of the product , and the absence of the strife that prevailed in the , old days of the saloon . ' " ' Prohibition has had a good effect upon our employes , ' says Mr. W. A. Rogers , President of the Bates &; Rogers Construction Company of Chicago . Says Liquor Interests Were Lawless . " They tall us , for instance , that the present reign of lawlessness should be ended by legalizing the sale of light wines and beer . Did the liquor interests ever obey . the law ? Did they obey it before prohibition ? They violated every provision of the law that stood between them and maximum profits . " If it was worth while to remain open after hours , they remained . open . If it was worth while to sell liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minors . They observed the law only when it was not worth while to break it . They know it , everybody knows it . What a fat chalice there is that these interests which were always lawless would be lawabiding if they were permitted to sell ' light , ' wines and beer . - When did they change their spots ? ? " The truth is that nobody who wants booze will ever be satisfied with anything that can not intoxicate . The ' kick ' is the thing , and the whole thing . That is why near beer , lind grape juice are not popular . It is as absurd , in the opinions of boozers , to have drinks without a sting as it would be to take a small boy to a circus that had no elephant . " But we may be sure that if saloons were authorized to open with light wines and beer they would not compel their customers to be content with such trifles . They would break the law and sell everything . As long as they were permitted to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it . There is no reason to believe they would obey the law they seek and confine themselves to light wines and beer . " Considering what Federal enforcement has been , and notwithstanding the difficulties in enforcement , it is a great tribute to the American people that prohibition has succeeded so well . Millions have ceased to drink becausethe saloons are gone and they are not enough interested to take the trouble to find out where they can get liquor . " Others have quit because they do not believe in violating the law ; others , because they have some regard for their health and place some value upon their lives . " This is no time to raise the white flag to the liquor interests . Prohibition is at its Gettysburg . The fight can be and Is being won . "
