Three questions arose in Congress between the regular Republicans and their insurgent fellows . One case was in the House and two were in the Senate . <P> No. 1 ) In the House in passing out committee places the regular Republicans ousted the insurgents from all strategic places . The test put to the insurgents was : a ) Had they voted for Longworth for Speaker , and b ) had they voted with the regular Republicans to change the rule on discharging committees ? They had not . The sword severed them from most of their committee places . The group from Wisconsin suffered most heavily . <P> John M. Nelson . LaFollette 's campaign manager 1924 , was taken off the rules committee and removed from the chairmanship of a committee on elections . <P> Henry Allen Cooper , aged supporter of LaFollette , he who nominated LaFollette at the Republican Convention two Junes ago , venerable and respected , was allowed to remain on the Foreign Affairs Committee but deprived of all seniority rank , which would soon have made him its chairman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairmanship and they were ousted from such committees as rivers and harbors , agriculture , postoffices . <P> No. 2 ) In the Senate the Republican Committee on Committees signalized the admission of Senator Bob LaFollette Jr . into the Republican ranks by assigning him to two of the committees on which his father held a place : Manufactures and Indian Affairs . Earlier in the week the Committee on Committees was deadlocked by the grotesquely inadvertent presence of Senator Wadsworth , no longer a member of the Committee , who strolled in and voted , in the absence of his successor Senator Means . Everyone implicated had displayed Olympian absentmindedness and no stigma attached to anyone . <P> No. 3 ) In the case of Gerald P. Nye , appointed by the Governor of North Dakota , the overt phase of the case is legal , not political . It is before a committee on privileges and elections headed by Senator Goff of West Virginia . Mr. Nye was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Ladd . The Governor has the power by state law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is a U. S. Senator a state officer ? Senator Goff thinks not . The matter will have to be thrashed out on the floor of the Senate . Mr. Nye is reckoned as a progressive if not an insurgent . The Republicans , aside from legal questions , would like to seat him , fearing that not to do so might antagonize the Northwest and lead to Republican defeats there next year . The Democrats would like to oust Mr. Nye , to make trouble for the Republicans , but the case is complicated by precedent . In 1914 , in a similar case about an appointee from Alabama , the Republicans voted against seating him ; the Democrats voted to seat him .
