Knight describes it in this wise : " This amazingly grand machine is propelled by mills which work three capital engines and contains 26,586 wheels , and 97,346 movements , which work 73,726 yards of organzine silk thread every time the water wheel goes round , being thrice in one minute , and 380,504,960 yards in one day and night . One water wheel gives motion to all the other movements , of which any one may be stopped separately without obstructing the rest . One fire-engine conveys warm air to every individual part of this vast machine , containing in all its buildings half a quarter of a mile in length .

" The Process of Evolution These references to industrial processes , mechanisms , and machinery and to methods of works organization and management show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples . Thus they can be regarded as a product of societal evolution . Eugene Szepesi has this to say of the process : " The road travelled by humanity was not a chosen one but a natural effect of our physical and psychological prime inheritances which laid the foundations of our economic progress from the very beginning . " That is , man has developed in his control of industry and manufacturing in step with artificial aids . He has brought to his assistance instrumental means to assist him in effecting results . Aids to Sense Two artificial aids to sense organs may be mentioned as sufficient to show their importance in manufacturing control . Our organs of hearing are now in touch with the world through the development of the telephone and radio . We receive impressions through our ears that were undreamed of even a decade ago , and those impressions , consciously or unconsciously , shape some of our decisions . The eyes , our organs of sight , have received tremendous assistance during recent years as shown  | by the following historical record from Alfred J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1350 . The invention of the microscope is credited to the Dutch optician , Janssen , 1590 . A modern microscope is capable of a magnification of several thousand diameters . ( This , however , does not indicate its separating ' power , which in point of fact , is only about two hundred times greater than that of the naked eye . ) Particles too small to be formed into a distinct image by the microscope can still be detected by the ultra microscope , invented by Zsigmondy in 1903 . By the method of X-ray photography developed chiefly by Laue , 1912 , and Bragg , 1915 , direct optical evidence of the arrangements of atoms in a crystal is obtained , and the distance between the layers , of the order of 100,000,000 of an inch is measured . This represents , in effect , a millionfold improvement on the separating power of the eye . The method of C. T. R. Wilson , 16 1912 , renders visible to the eye the track of an electron , whose diameter is of the order of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision is , in such case as this , virtually multiplied by two hundred billion . The step from the use of a crude pair of spectacles in 1300 to this was taken in the space of about six centuries ? and much of the progress is condensed within a space of less than three decades . The evolution of man 's artificial sense organs has proceeded at a pace so utterly out of scale with that of his natural equipment that the aid of diagrammatic representation quite forsakes us here . " footnote Elements of Physical Biology , p. 365.  | Aids to Action In a similar way artificial aids place us in communication with the entire world . The slow method of sending a message by courier on foot or horseback has given way to the air-mail , telegraph , and cable . The manager 's will can now be made instantly effective the world over .

It is unthinkable that they should ever be abandoned except for other aids still more useful . That is , we have evolved in the carrying on of everyday activities along with these aids and they now have become a part of us . Evolution of Management Laws Both origin and development indicate that management laws are a result of evolution , both organic and societal . One other test remains to be applied as a final examination of this theory . A method , practice or law of evolutionary origin must have this characteristic : it can not be dropped for the method or law which has preceded it . That is , there is no back tracking . Or , in other words , any result of an evolutionary process is a part of an irreversible cycle.17 footnote TT " We at once recognize also that the law of evolution is the law of irreversible transformations ; that the direction of evolution ( which had baffled description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The management methods previously discussed stand up under this final test . We can not imagine giving up the advantages of division of labor for the methods of the " jack-of-all-trades " ; it is unthinkable that the producing machinery of our great factories can be replaced by handicraft ; wages have steadily increased for centuries ? we can not believe they will ever drop ; hours of labor are shortening and the leisure thus enjoyed by our working people will never be given up . And so on for all of the great evolutionary changes that have come with the development of our American institution of manufacture . Characteristics of the Laws Having developed the theory that the laws of management are evolutionary laws , we are now in a position to state their characteristics . These are three : They are resistant to change . They are universal in application . They are imperative to the highest success . The next step is the formulation of these laws in uniform language to express either a relationship between cause and effect or a definite trend .

The law of evolution is , in this sense , the second law of thermodynamics . " ? Elements of Physical Biology , Lotka , p. 26.  | LAW OF LEADERSHIP Records of Three Manufacturers : Simeon North George Westinghouse Henry Ford Characteristics of Leadership : Creative Power High Purpose Courage and Knowledge Intelligence Tireless Industry  | LAW OF LEADERSHIP Achievements in manufacturing enterprises come from decisions put into effect by the will of the one who decides and who gives orders to be executed . The familiar saying that any institution is but the shadow of a man , of a creative mind , is particularly true of producing establishments . The reason for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expressed in the law of leadership . Wise leadership is more essential to successful operation than extensive organization or perfect equipment . This law has long been recognized in military affairs , having been succinctly stated by one of Napoleon 's historians as " a wise direction is of more avail than overwhelming numbers , sound strategy than the most perfect armament . " Henry L. Gantt 18 paraphrased this for industry as " a wise policy is of more avail than a large plant , good management than perfect equipment . " Military Leadership Napoleon said of military leadership : " In war men are nothing ; it is the man who is everything . The general is the head , the whole of any army . footnote ie Industrial Leadership , p. 12.  | It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul , but Caesar ; it was not the Carthaginian army that made Rome tremble in her gates , but Hannibal ; it was not the Macedonian army that reached the Indus , but Alexander ; it was not the French army that carried the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not the Prussian army which , for seven years , defended Prussia against the three greatest powers of Europe , but Frederick the Great . " The history of famous armies is the history of great generals , for no army has ever achieved great things unless it has been well commanded . If the general is second-rate , the army also will be second-rate . " These facts so plainly recognized in military history have their exact counterpart in manufacturing . The factory and office invariably reflect the manager . His policy and direction are the deciding factors for success or failure in operation . The application of this law replaces the autocratic management methods of driving and forcing by the democratic methods of teaching and training . Examples of Leadership Examples of the application of the law of leadership and accomplishments from its use are found in every period and at every step in the development of American manufacturing . From many that might be selected , three have been taken to show outstanding records of achievement . Considered together the lives and works of these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire manufacturing period of this country  | from 1797 to the present day , and the contemporary member of the group is the most prominent manufacturer of the present . There are many points of similarity in the quality of their achievements , in the personal characteristics of the men and in their attitudes of mind . Each contributed manfully in a national crisis , and the two who have gone left to their ages the rich heritage of an honorable life and to their descendants an.example to emulate . The Three Leaders The earliest of the three was the first official pistol maker of the United States and one of the originators of the American system of mass production . The second advanced the art of transportation by the invention and development of the air brake and extended and cheapened the manufacture of power by the development and use of the alternating current in the distribution and application of electrical energy . The third , whose life 's work is by no means done , has built the motor car for the great multitude . To name them , Simeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1799 until his death in 1852 . George Westinghouse began his first manufacturing enterprise in 1867 . From that humble start his interests grew until fifty thousand workers were employed in 1907 and the Westinghouse Associated Companies numbered 103 . His death occurred in 1914 . Henry Ford in 1903 founded the Ford Motor Company which has since turned out fifteen million automobiles of one model , has employed six hundred thousand men at one time and has paid over  | two billion dollars in wages and salaries . To sketch their careers in some detail is to bring out the attributes of leadership . Simeon North Simeon North , a Connecticut Yankee of colonial ancestry , had as a background for manufacturing nothing but his New England blacksmith shop . This was a place of few and simple tools but highly developed resourcefulness and skill . Conditions just before and during the Revolutionary War put firearms in great demand . In 1774 England prohibited the exportation of arms to the colonies ; the General Assembly of Connecticut retorted by offering a bounty of five shillings for every stand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province , and one shilling six pence for every good gun lock . This act indicates something of the difficulty of arms making in colonial times . National defense was one of the first cares of Congress after our Government was established . So it is not strange to find an appropriation of $800,000 in 1798 for the purchase of arms and ammunition . North 's first contract so far as is known was for 500 horse pistols at $6.50 each and was dated March 9 , 1799 . He thus became the first official pistol manufacturer to the United States Government and probably the first man in the country to make pistol manufacture his principal business . The state of the art of metal working at this time is indicated by the fact that the screw cutting engine lathe was invented in England but two years before the date of this contract . Numerous other contracts for pistols followed and  | in 1823 North secured his first order for rifles . Up to his time pistols had been made one by one with the simple tools of the handicraft workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts in duplicate and was the first manufacturer to enter into a contract for arms the parts of which should be interchangeable . Invention of Mass Production In so doing he founded the American system of manufacturing now commonly called mass production . This honor he shares , however , with another Connecticut manufacturer , Eli Whitney , who also developed interchangeable manufacture at about the same time in the production of muskets . North 's Characteristics North was persistent , clear-headed , possessed of intuitive mechanical ability , genial in temperament , of high personal honor , square in all his dealings , conscious of the dignity of labor , and with tireless industry directed by an alert and creative mind . It is said of him that no man ever worked for him who did not love him . The best word picture we have of this early manufacturer is from an English traveler , Daniel Pidgeon , who described him as the " Connecticut man " and nicknamed his state " Clockland . " He describes North in this way : " Unusually tall , thin , reflective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever , and above all things , free , the equal ,  | although a mechanic , of the capitalist upon whose ready alliance he counts , he is an element of incalculable value to American industry . His method of attacking manufacturing problems is one which , intelligently handled , must command markets by simultaneously improving qualities and cheapening prices . We Englishmen certainly aim , as they do in New England , at the specialization of manufacture ; but one scarcely treads upon the threshold of Clockland , ' before feeling how much more universally the system is being applied in the United States . Tools and processes which we are inclined to consider exceptionally clever , are the commonplaces of American shops , and the determination to do nothing by hand which can be done by a machine is the chief characteristic . The Connecticut man ' is an element of the utmost importance in the industrial development of America , a force for which we unfortunately have no equivalent in England . " 19 George Westinghouse Engineering was in the blood of the second of our leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop in Schenectady where he made agricultural machinery , mill machinery , and small steam engines . Here Westinghouse 's boyhood was passed until he entered the Union Army in the Civil War to be mustered out in 1865 , a veteran officer not yet nineteen years of age . He returned to his father 's shop and began his creative life 's work not to be interrupted until his death footnote 19 Old World Questions and New World Answers , by Daniel Pidgeon , F. G. S. , New York , 1885.  | forty-nine years later . In this same year his first patent was issued to him for a rotary steam engine , the date being October 31 , 1865 . While this was not a commercial success , somewhat later he turned it into a water meter and from it established an industry . Patents for a car replacer and a railroad frog followed in 1867 , 1868 and 1869 . To produce these railroad appliances he founded a little business which justified his marriage before he was twenty-one . But the real foundation of his fame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first brake patent was issued April 13 , 1869 , when he was twenty-two and a half years old . Up to 1873 he had taken out twenty or more other patents on details of the brake apparatus . But these did not exhaust the art . Other inventions flowed copiously as the years went by . Other Inventions In a system of traffic control , brakes and signals are in close relation . In 1880 Westinghouse acquired the American rights for English patents on interlocking switches and signals . Thus was established another great industry . In this field he made radical and highly important inventions . For instance , in 1881 there were issued to him six patents in signalling and interlocking , one of them revolutionary . In the same year there were ten brake patents and five in other arts ? twenty-one patents in a single year .  | The eleven years from 1880 through 1890 brought many great things . The Westinghouse Brake Company , Ltd. , was started ; the Union Switch and Signal Company launched ; the Philadelphia Company formed ; the Westinghouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Company , Ltd. , were started . In this period of prodigious activity the quick action brake was produced and the electrical art revolutionized by Westinghouse 's vision of the possibilities of alternating current . Here is demonstrated his activity of creative imagination , boldness of conception and capacity for work . In these eleven years he took out one hundred and thirty-four patents , more than one a month . Other Great Achievements But after 1890 there were more great achievements . The lighting of the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 was a striking technical success , and gave great encouragement to the development of the incandescent lamp industry . In October , 1893 the Westinghouse Electric Company took the contract for the first electric generator at Niagara Falls . Its building , installation and operation marked a revolutionary event in the electrical art . The question of the distribution of power by the alternating current was settled forever . Meanwhile , Westinghouse became interested in the production and distribution of natural gas and took out thirty-eight gas patents mainly concerned with devices of distribution and control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Herman West-  | inghouse , the manufacturing of gas engines and gas producers . A considerable number of very large gas engines were made but the gas producer enterprise was a disappointment . The Steam Turbine About 1895 , Westinghouse became interested in the steam turbine and his work profoundly influenced the art . Eventually turbine building became the principal part of the work of the Westinghouse Machine Company and in conjunction with the Electric Company , many large turbo-generators were built for central station power houses . To adapt the high speed of the steam turbine to the propulsion of ships , Westinghouse , about 1909 , undertook the manufacture of a reduction gear invented by Rear Admiral George W. Melville ( U. S. N. ) and John H. MacAlpine . Before 1907 , the Westinghouse shops were spread out from San Francisco to St. Petersburg and employed fifty thousand workers in production and distribution . Referring to his influence on their operation Col. Henry G. Prout , his biographer , says : " In all these activities Westinghouse had a constant part in executive conduct as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constant for the best results . He was a prolific inventor , a bold and resourceful financier , a man of capacious imagination and foresight as to things to be done , and a powerful executive ; but perhaps he was not a great administrator . " 20 footnote Z0 A Life of George Westinghouse , p. 18.  | Years of Difficulty The panic of 1907 brought the tragedy of Westinghouse 's life , the failure and receivership of the Electric Company , the Machine Company and some other minor enterprises . The Air Brake Company and Union Switch and Signal Company were unaffected . A reorganization was worked out largely through his planning , but he lost control of the Electric Company and in four years ceased to have any official relation with its organization and operation . The years that followed were filled with characteristic unceasing activity and undying hope . He was busy with the affairs of the Machine Company , with turbine developments and the invention of an air spring for automobiles . Death came in 1914 , closing the career of one of America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and leaving the heritage of more than four hundred patents and a group of world-flung enterprises . Henry Ford Of the third leading American manufacturer chosen to emphasize the importance of the law of leadership , it is more difficult to write . Our view of Henry Ford lacks the clarifying perspective of time . Yet much can be presented concerning his achievements and by way of appraisement of his career . Mechanically inclined , Ford worked as a machinist and stationary engineer while experimenting with a motor car . His first automobile was completed in 1892 ? a two-cylinder affair with something of the appear-  | ance of a buggy . So much of a curiosity was it that its inventor had to carry a chain and padlock and chain the car to a lamp post when he left it so that no inquisitive person could run it . After driving this car about a thousand miles , Ford sold it in 1896 for $200 . Beginning Automobile Manufacture In 1899 he definitely went into the automobile business as chief engineer of the Detroit Automobile Company , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In March , 1902 he resigned , determined never again to put himself under orders , and opened a shop of his own . From that time until the Ford Motor Company was organized all of his energy was devoted to investigation and experiment . In 1903 came the formation of his own company with a capital stock of $100,000 of which $28,000 was paid in . Ford held 251/2% . But the desire to control compelled him to increase his holdings to 51% in 1906 and a little later through another purchase to 581/2% . In 1919 his son bought the remaining 411/2% , paying $12,500 per share . The Ford interests for some time have been considered as worth a billion dollars and the $28,000 previously mentioned is the only capital investment ever put into the enterprises except from earned profits . Model T In 1909 the decision was made to build only one model ? " Model T " ? with a single chassis for all cars . During that first season 18,664 cars were sold . On  | May 31 , 1922 , car No. 5,000,000 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000,000 left the assembly floor . From that time until May , 1927 some five million more were produced , giving a total production of 15,000,000 for one standardized car . No other achievement of mass production methods has been so well known , nor more often commented upon . Meanwhile Ford plants were flung around the world and new industries added , all contributing to the manufacture of motor cars . The following list indicates both spread and variety : figure  | Ford 's Daring Moves But this record of growth and success is far from showing all of the results of leadership . Henry Ford has done many new and daring things in manufacturing . Standardization on one model of car has already been referred to . In 1914 by executive order the wages of Ford employees were raised from somewhat more than $2.40 per day to a flat minimum of $5.00 per day . In March , 1928 the schedule for 80,044 employees was this : 506 earned under $6 per day ; 17,307 earned from $6 to $7 per day ; 39,305 from $7 to $8 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 ; 2,538 from $10 to $12 ; and 118 from $12 up . Inventory has been reduced 75% by considering material in transit the same as if in storage ; the production time from iron ore to finished motor is less than 5 days ; the average time to transport finished product from factory to destination is but 6.16 days . New , improved and revolutionary processes and machinery have been developed ; the manufacture of glass , artificial leather , flax and woolen fabrics , eight hundred special machine tools , iron mining , and lumbering ? these are but examples . Village industries , located in small communities away from the overhead expenses which must be incurred in a large city , have been experimentally started with gratifying results as regards the cost of product . Some of these shops employ but a dozen workers . Finally comes the matter of cost . Here the record of reduction is remarkable as indicated by the selling price of Model T. The first price of this touring car ,  | that of 1909-1910 , was $950 ; the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture was $290 . The Ford Balance Sheet The total profit and loss surplus of the Ford Motor Company , as shown by a balance sheet filed on April 18 , 1928 with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Corporations , is the formidable total of $654,851,061 . This is after a shut-down of nearly a year due to the redesigning of the car , the retooling of assembly plants and reorganization for renewed manufacture . The change required the expenditure of millions in the fixed capital account . The balance sheet as filed compares with that of the previous year as follows : figure  | Careers of the Leaders These brief accounts of the careers of three leaders in manufacturing are records of successful operation extending over a century and a quarter . The law of leadership previously given declares that for successful operation wise leadership is more essential than extensive organization or perfect equipment . The lives and activities of North , Westinghouse and Ford support both parts of this law . Lack of Organization Taking up the element of organization first , North was a patriarch , the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of modern organization he had none . But let his biographers describe the relationships that existed between master and men : " As his business grew , Simeon North employed a steadily increasing number of skilled workmen , the larger contracts of his later years often requiring the aid of a hundred or more mechanics . Skilled workmen were hard to find in those days , and a great proportion of those employed in the gun shop were apprentices , growing up under the eye and the training of the master . Thus there came to exist between him and his people a peculiarly intimate relationship , very different from anything seen in these days between employer and employee . It is a family tradition that always on his return from one of his many journeys to Washington or elsewhere , which often involved long absences , Simeon would go through his shops , calling each workman by name , shaking hands with him , and inquiring for the members of his family . There are many legends  | of merry winter evenings passed around the big log fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men exchanged experiences . These were the patriarchal days of American manufacturing , when there was that something in common between master and man , which has long ceased to exist ; the days when this common interest took the place of the modern trade union ; the days when the workmen felt that their welfare was safe in the hands of the master because of a sympathetic bond and a mutual interest . " 21 Westinghouse also worked without what we know as modern organization , the methods of which have grown up since he was active , many , in fact , since his death . As to Ford he heartily condemns organization : " To my mind there is no bent of mind more dangerous than that which is sometimes described as the genius for organization . ' This usually results in the birth of a great big chart showing , after the fashion of a family tree , how authority ramifies . The tree is heavy with nice round berries , each of which bears the name of a man or of an office . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited by the circumference of his berry . " 22 Lack of Equipment Turning now to the matter of manufacturing equipment , each man created his own . North moved forward from the hand tools of the Connecticut blacksmith shop to the machine tools and small tools of the modern footnote m Simeon North , S. N. D. North , LL.D. , and Ralph H. North , pp. 31-32. z ' My Life and Work , p. 91.  | machine shop . Westinghouse created all his great plants as they were needed to carry out his plans . Ford has produced more special machinery and equipment than any other man of his generation . That is , each of these men has been superior to organization and has produced his own equipment as and when it was needed . Their leadership was always dominant and so was the greatest essential in their success . Qualities and Characteristics Before leaving this matter , however , it may be instructive to indicate some of the qualities and characteristics they held in common . These are principally five . Each leader was creative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these up in order . Creative Power North 's creative power showed in his development of a new system of manufacture and the necessary equipment to make it operative . Westinghouse took out four hundred patents on his inventions . Ford has brought to success the motor car of the multitude and has earned a billion dollars in profit . High Purpose North 's high purpose in life was to manufacture a particular article of which his country stood in need . Westinghouse sought to contribute to the safety , happiness and comfort of his fellow men . Ford has endeavored to render good service through his low-priced automobile .  | Courage and Honor In 1826 when North was sixty-one years old , the failure of a business house whose notes he had endorsed compelled him to make an assignment . By placing a mortgage of $68,000 on his property he was able to continue in business . For twenty-two years he carried this burden . But in 1848 when he was eighty-three years old , he paid off the last penny and was free . Westinghouse also went through business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten . " Ford for several years fought single-handed the famous Selden Patent suit and finally won . Independence As to independence , North only had a partner in business for a few months and he was a brother-in-law . Westinghouse started his first enterprise alone . Ford secured control of his enterprises almost from the first and eventually with the help of his son secured sole family ownership . Industry The industry of the three men is most striking . North manufactured for fifty-three years , Westinghouse for forty-eight , and Ford is still the ruling genius of his various enterprises . Each had numerous outside interests as well which required attention and energy and helped to complete the picture of tireless work and inexhaustible capacity for accomplishment . The law of leadership has thus been illustrated by the accomplishments of three extremely successful manufacturers . However , there are thousands of managers  | and executives in manufacturing plants today who exhibit the same qualities and characteristics though applied to enterprises of smaller size . For wherever there is work to be done and men to be directed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WORK Personal ability of managers , executives , and supervisors in manufacturing concerns is supplemented by and made more effective through the application of various methods and devices . Many of these have been brought to a high state of development and extensively utilized . They are based principally upon two laws of executive work : the law of authority and responsibility , and the law of exceptions . Both of these laws were clearly recognized by the early leaders in management as references will show . RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY The law of responsibility and authority is stated as follows : Responsibility for the execution of work must be accompanied by the authority to control and direct the means for doing the work . Henry L. Gantt declared this law with much positiveness . " The authority to issue an order involves the responsibility to see that it is properly executed . " 23 And again , " Authority and responsibility for performance must be centered in the same individual . " 24 This law governs organization whether in the static footnote " Industrial Leadership , p. 8 . " Organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dynamic form of personnel . Gantt declared that more than any other fundamental it is influential in promoting the success of an organization . The system of management which he advocated and installed was based upon it , for a man can only assume the responsibility for doing work properly when he not only knows how to do it himself but can also teach someone else to do it satisfactorily . George S. Radford has also emphasized the importance of this law : 25 " It is a well-accepted principle that responsibility should be reinforced by adequate authority . " Thus on the one hand this law declares the simple justice of accompanying responsibility with delegated authority and control , and on the other of unavoidable responsibility for the proper execution of an order or the completing of work once the authority for so doing has been assumed . Process of Devolution The process of transferring authority and responsibility is one of devolution . That is , the manager , when his duties become so numerous or pressing that he can not properly attend to them all , delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility for certain acts . If this law of executive work is followed , adequate authority is delegated at the same time that the responsibility is shifted , so that control may be had of all the necessary means for doing the work . It has become customary to indicate the responsi- footnote Management 's Handbook , p. 710.  | bility of the members of an executive group by functions and on a chart to indicate the flow of authority and limitations of responsibility by connecting lines . Thus the organization chart , as it is called , is now a common management device . Application of the Law Examples of the effect or results of the application of this law of authority and responsibility are not numerous , but one such can be cited here . The plant where a situation needed improvement was that of the Canister Company of New Jersey . The problem and its solution is described by the General Manager , Owen Earhart , in this manner : " In the summer the machinery and manufacturing equipment of the Republic Can and Metal Company were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Phillipsburg , New Jersey . This change brought two well-established manufacturing organizations together into one producing unit . " The bringing together of the personnel and equipment of these two separate concerns resulted quite naturally in some disruption or disorganization to the routine work of the Canister Company . Due to the general improvement in business , also , we were faced in the following October with a situation where orders were coming in at an unprecedented rate . We , therefore , found it necessary to take steps to make full use of the combined capacity of the plant . Upset conditions were remedied in a comparatively short time by a reorganization of the factory personnel , by placing responsibility for performance in each department  | squarely upon the foreman in charge , and by scheduling orders to the sequence desired by the sales department . " The principal result was an increase in production in two and one-half months from 50,000 to 90,000 units per day with a doubling of factory billing . " EXCEPTIONS The law of exceptions , the second law of executive work , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrating managerial attention solely upon those executive matters which are variations from routine , plan , or standard . This law received quite as much attention by the leaders in management as the law of responsibility and authority . Frederick W. Taylor declared the importance of the " exception principle " saying that it should extend throughout the entire field of business operation . He explained it in this way : 26 " It is not an uncommon sight , though a sad one , to see the manager of a large business fairly swamped at his desk with an ocean of letters and reports , on each of which he thinks that he should put his initial or stamp . He feels that by having this mass of detail pass over his desk he is keeping in close touch with the entire business . The exception principle is directly the reverse of this . Under it the manager should receive only condensed , summarized , and invariably comparative reports , covering , however , all of the elements entering into the management , and even these summaries should footnote m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by an assistant before they reach the manager , and have all of the exceptions to the past averages or to the standards pointed out , both the especially good and especially bad exceptions , thus giving him in a few minutes a full view of progress that is being made , or the reverse , and leaving him free to consider the broader lines of policy and to study the character and fitness of the important men under him . " Recognition of Importance G. Charter Harrison recognized its supreme importance in describing " variations between actual and standard costs " when he developed his cost variation formulas : 27 " Having determined that a certain article should cost a certain amount to manufacture , in other words , having set a standard cost for it , the manufacturer should be able to dismiss the question of this cost from his mind until such time as there is a discrepancy between the actual and the standard costs . It is the prime function of the cost accountant to draw the attention of the operating executive promptly to the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cost accounting is based upon the principle of exceptions . " Graphical and visual devices such as charts , diagrams , maps and control boards have had extensive application in manufacturing operation as means to bring exceptions quickly and forcefully to the attention of the management . Thus routine matters are passed by without consideration or comment for they are proceeding according to plan . However , once the routine footnote " Management 's Handbook , p. 1382.  | is broken , the graphical device lifts up a warning flag and executive action can be taken to correct the situation before serious loss or damage has occurred . An Application in General Management By an application of this law Thomas A. Edison is kept continually in touch with the operating progress and results of his numerous industries . Certain barometers , performances or requirements have been established and Mr. Edison is continually advised of any deviations above a certain percentage from these requirements or standards . The means used is described by Ralph H. Allen , vice-president , Thomas A. Edison , Inc. , in this way . The quotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to Mr. Edison 's attention unusual happenings in the form of news . These happenings are sometimes of a business and sometimes of a personal nature . " This information is supplied to Mr. Edison in the form of a semi-weekly leaflet which we call The Flash . ' This leaflet is confidential , obviously , and its circulation is limited to the members of the Executive Board of the Edison Industries . It is prepared in the president 's office from information received from every branch of the Edison Industries . The Flash ' also contains a number of actual figures on sales , purchases , etc . " An Application to Costs This law has received adoption among all ranks of the management group and has been applied to all kinds of work . One of its most important and widespread  | uses is in connection with the setting and operation of standard cost systems . Here a principal control feature is the comparison of the actual costs as they are accumulated with the predetermined or standard costs for the work in question . The important step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard and to determine why they are too low or too high . This is an investigation into the exceptions from the standards . An example of this application of the law of exceptions in a system of standard costs is presented by the experience of the Le Roi Company . Three executives , in letters to the author , expressed their opinion as to the usefulness of the system . C. W. Pendock , the president , wrote : " It provides a very close analysis of the business , thereby enabling me to pay especial attention to such items as do not appear to be running in line . The monthly statement contains about 20 items , all of which are of great interest and value , as it gives a very vivid picture of the cost of production for the period , in comparison with other periods . " The general superintendent , Mr. Gregerson , says that these methods are one of the greatest helps he has ever had in running the factory . " I am furnished with a daily labor efficiency summary which tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I am able to correct these with the least delay . Under the old job-order cost system our information was received too late to be of any real value . " The standard cost system gives the factory a square deal . It is true that it shows up our mistakes ? which  | it ought to do ? but it also shows up our accomplishments . Under the old system it was n't possible to tell whether a cost increase was the fault of the factory or not . We were often blamed for things for which we were not responsible . Now our standard cost system places blame and credit exactly where they belong . " Fred Huennekens finds similar advantages from the foreman 's viewpoint . " Before we had our standard cost system we foremen were in the dark regarding the results we were getting in our departments . Now a report comes to us each day which tells us how well we did our job yesterday or how much it cost the company because things went wrong . " We are always on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trying to find ways of licking ' them and keeping them licked . ' " Formulas for Cost Exceptions G. Charter Harrison , whose work in connection with the development of standard costs has been previously referred to , has developed a group of formulas 28 to assist in analyzing the variations ( exceptions ) between actual and standard costs and to help in exploring the causes . This method is , therefore , a mathematical application of the law of exceptions in the field of one management function . footnote zs Management 's Handbook , p. 1382.  | LAWS OF SPECIALIZATION AND STANDARDIZATION Division of Work or Specialization of the Job Division of Effort or Specialization of the Individual Transfer of Skill or Specialization of the Machine Simplification or Specialization of Product Standardization of Methods , Instructions , Times , Machines , Tools , and Product  | LAWS OF SPECIALIZATION AND STANDARDIZATION Modern factory production in all its variety and complexity has been developed and brought to its present mechanical perfection principally through the application of the laws of specialization , closely associated with which are the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " principles " by the early British economists who saw the rise of the factory system out of handicraft methods . In spite of a century and a half of use in the factory , their application is by no means complete and never can be . New operations , more effective fitting of worker to task , improved machinery and equipment , and new materials and products are evidence of the continuing efforts to specialize still further . In any consideration of the laws of specialization and their application , one caution must be emphasized . To specialize does not mean to make " specials . " Quite the opposite is true . The economies and control of magnitudes due to specializing have made possible interchangeable products , duplicate manufacture and mass production . Thus , a first step in the understanding of the operation of the modern institution of manufacturing is a grasp of these laws and an appreciation of their influence on the physical processes and methods of pro-  | duction and on the economic status of industrial workers . SPECIALIZATION There are four laws of specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work or Specialization of the Job . Subdividing work so that one or a very few manual or mental operations can be assigned to a worker improves the quality and increases the quantity of output . 2 . Law of Division of Effort or Specialization of the Individual : Assigning to each worker one or a very few manual or mental operations which he is particularly adapted to perform improves the quality and increases the quantity of output . COROLLARY : Law of Functional Management ( Functional Foremanship ) or Specialization of the Management : As the scope of an executive 's responsibility is narrowed his efficiency increases . 3 . Law of Transfer of Skill or Specialization of Tools and Machines : The attention and skill required to use a tool or operate a machine is inversely as the skill transferred into its mechanism .  | 4 . Law of Simplification or Specialization of Product : Concentrating upon the manufacture of a single or a few types and sizes of product tends to improve the quality and lower the production cost . Division of Labor The first three of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the law of division of labor . However , they are distinct . The practice of division of work is as ancient as the performance of useful tasks , but the development of laborsaving machinery has come within the past one hundred and fifty years , while the scientific selection of the worker and his adaptation for a particular task has had its rise in the present century . Adam Smith 29 in discussing division of labor recognized three reasons why it increases production : " This great increase in the quantity of work , which , in consequence of the division of labor , the same number of people are capable of performing , is owing to three different circumstances ; first , to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman ; secondly , to the saving of the time , which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another ; and , lastly , to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many . " Charles Babbage a0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further explanation which footnote " Wealth of Nations , p. 11. 10 On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures , p. 137.  | is a statement from the employer 's point of view of the law of specialization of the individual : " That the master manufacturer , by dividing work to be executed into different processes , each requiring different degrees of skill and force , can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process ; whereas , if the whole work were executed by one workman that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult , and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious of the operations into which the art is divided . " James Hartness , 31 a leading machine tool designer and builder , president of Jones and Lamson Machine Company , has written of the subdivision of work and specialization from a modern viewpoint : " The most complete subdivision of work must be made , to the end that each division may be readily understood , and that in this division and classification of tasks there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man should be in his own place . " And again : " The division of work into separate operations makes it possible to divide the subject into relatively small sub-problems . This division of the subject itself brings it within the capacity of lesser brains and makes it very much easier for a brain of greater power . In other words , the subdivision of work makes places in which all mental equipments may be used . This subdivision develops greatest dexterity and skill , as well as the keenest comprehension of the ways and means of attaining a given end . And this dexterity of operation footnote n The Human Factor in Works Management , pp. 6 , 36 , 37 , 64 , 55 , 56.  | is more easily carried on than is the fumbling uncertainty of the work of the more primitive type . " In regard to specialization : " Specialization divides the work into various classes so as to have all of one kind of operations performed in one place . It tends to reduce the range of operations performed by each man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watching a tack-making machine , we find that his mind and body fit into the conditions . This soon results in a more perfect comprehension of the intricate mechanism of the machine and in acquiring a wonderful skill in making the necessary adjustments . He then becomes most efficient in producing a large output of tacks . He does this work easily ; in fact , it is safe to say that efficiency and comfort go together . " Division of Mental Work Early considerations of the law of division of labor restrict its application to manual work . However , Babbage , Hartness , and Dexter S. Kimball have shown that mental work and effort should be included , that the fundamentals of specialization hold for professions as well as for trades . Babbage 's positive statement is : " The division of labor can be applied with equal success to mental operations , and . . . ensures by its adoption the same economy of time . " 32 Hartness declares that the inexorable law of ultimate supremacy demands " the most complete subdivision of all the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economy of Machinery and Manufactures , p. 153.  | as to get the great results that accrue from repetition of processes . " ss Kimball includes mental work under the operation of this law on the basis of experience : " It is human experience that as a man concentrates his efforts , either mental or manual , his skill in his chosen specialty and the quantity of his product increases . " s4 Functional Management The corollary to the law of division of effort is a consequence of the specialization of the individual . Taylor as explains functional management by saying that it " consists in so dividing the work of management that each man from the assistant superintendent down shall have as few functions as possible to perform . If practicable the work of each man in the management should be confined to the performance of a single leading function . " Concept of Transference of Skill The third law of specialization is based on the concept that skill , thought , and intelligence ? the ability to do ? are transferred into and become fixed in mechanism so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive work . Roland has clearly described the process . " Intelligence may be transferred from the brain of the machine-maker to the machine itself to such an extent and with such permanence that the machine which the tool-maker has thus imbued with a portion of his footnote " Human Factor in Works Management , p. 7 . " Principles of Industrial Organization , p. 46 . " Shop Management , p. 99.  | own wits can subsequently , so long as it is in working order , supplement with this endowment the small mechanical skill of its tender . " Kimball 36 who has written more understandingly on this law than anyone else , says : " Transfer of skill is in fact the basic idea in all tool construction . It is embodied in the first stone ax and all succeeding improvements in tools of production were , essentially , advances in transfer of skill . " It is evident that for a given operation the more skill that is transferred to the machine the less is required in the operation . When nearly all the skill has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is called a semiautomatic machine . " . . . it is possible to make machines to which all the required skill and thought have been transferred and the machine does not even require an attendant . Such machines are known as full automatic machines . " The true significance of the industrial revolution , therefore , is that prior to that time the tool was always an adjunct to the skill of the worker . The great inventions carried transfer of skill to the point where the skill of the worker became an adjunct to the tool or machine . " Simplification The fourth law of specialization , simplification of product , is being applied extensively in American manufacturing . Ray M. Hudson37 explains the practice as : " When a manufacturing company reduces its types and sizes to the least number possible , it is simplifica- footnote 8e Principles of Industrial Organization , pp. 12 , 13. 37 Management 's Handbook , p. 989.  | tion . If a group of manufacturers of a certain line of products should agree to concentrate their production and sales on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes of each article in the group , then simplification is carried out on a broader scale . But the articles themselves may not have been standardized in any sense . " SPECIALIZATION OF THE JOB Subdividing work so that one or a very few manual or mental operations can be assigned to a worker improves the quality and increases the quantity of output . In applying the law of specialization of the job there has been developed an extensive body of practice for the purpose of studying processes , methods and operations in manufacturing . As a result it is not only possible so to arrange the work that any individual of a large group or class ( untrained girls , for example , in soldering radio parts ) can be assigned to the work , but many operations at present under less organized working conditions can be eliminated . The principal methods used to study operations are time study , motion study , and motion-time analysis . The device used to record results of such studies , that is , the permanent record of how to do the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is widely used and is found in a large variety of forms . The possibilities of saving time and reducing cost by pushing forward the division of the work into new and more economical arrangements is constantly being  | availed of in all progressive plants . John G. Aldrich says that over a period of ten years in the New England Butt Company , of which he is general manager , that 20% of the manufacturing operations were cut out . This is by no means an unusual record . Specialization Permits Control of Production During the past few years the possibilities of mechanically controlling the pace or speed of production by specializing jobs have been investigated and in many places have been brought to a high degree of effectiveness . The outstanding example is the application of assembly conveyors in automobile building plants . John Younger has pointed out that this particular application is one of the secrets of the high production of the Ford Motor Company : " Probably no feature of the Ford plants has been so much investigated , discussed and written about as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to place within the factory , enabling the men to stand still while they work . They are carefully timed and synchronized to govern the rate of production . Through careful time studies of the operations they are controlled so that they do not move too slowly , wasting time , nor too fast , thus crowding men and machines beyond efficient capacity . " So wonder-working have these conveyors appeared , especially to certain foreign visitors , that the term " Fordize " has been applied to them and the manufacturing system which it is thought they illustrate . " Coming down to fundamentals , however , these conveyors are an example ? striking to be sure ? of one of  | the manufacturing laws of specialization . This is true whether they are applied to operations in the production of parts or to operations in assembling cars . Behind both applications is the purpose to split up or subdivide the work so that each man or woman has a very few operations to perform . The result must be improved quality of product , increased quantity of output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conveyor does not bring about the specialization of itself , it is but a mechanical device that permits the specialization of jobs and workers so that each of the latter can perform one small operation in manufacturing parts or in assembling , and fit what he does together with that done by others to turn out the finished part or assembled car . " Standard Times Upon this law of specialization of the job has also been developed the practice of setting standard times for doing work . Once work is thoroughly specialized through subdivision based on operation study and the permanent record made of how to do this specialized work , it becomes possible to set standard times and take full advantage of the cost reducing effect of incentive wage payment . The reason for this is that workers can produce most effectively under standardized conditions . Frederic A. Parkhurst has said that in many kinds of manufacturing 90% of the work done can be put on standard time . And further , that the production of the workers can be doubled , tripled , or even quadrupled depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Possibilities of Improvement No better idea of the possibilities of improvement in doing manufacturing work can be found than the summary of Parkhurst previously mentioned . " From an extensive accumulation of statistics and records , covering thousands of cases in my experience , I have been able to summarize the efficiency of several groups of workers . But before presenting these facts , let it be understood that the low efficiencies disclosed are in no way a reflection on the employees . They rather reflect fault of the management . " The following low efficiencies of workers on unstandardized tasks generally prevail : ( a ) The unskilled worker and those doing routine clerical jobs , working generally in small groups and under average good supervision , are found to be 50% efficient . " This is the result in a small group directly supervised . ( b ) The average machine operator , or man doing a routine job with certain more or less fixed and perhaps mechanically controlled equipment , is found to be 38% to 40% efficient . " The reason for this is that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not incomplete ) instructions , it is assumed that his more or less mechanically controlled job requires little supervision and follow-up . Generally speaking , there are more men of this class under one supervisor than in class ( a ) .  | ( c ) The general all-round mechanic or journeyman hired to do a variety of work , supposed to be competent , hence requiring less supervision and left to plan most of his work and often to find ways and means of doing it , is found to be 30% efficient . " The reason for this is that the greater variety of his work combined with the fact that he must perform a number of different operations , often in several different places or with different machines for which he must also collect the needed tools , means that his job is , generally speaking , not so well supervised or controlled . This same man , however , working under standardized conditions and benefitting by facilities contributed through better management , is quick to profit when the opportunity is offered to increase his output as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-round tool-maker , tool designer , tool draftsman , die sinker , patternmaker , and men of this class are but 25% to 28% efficient . " The reason for this is that they receive a minimum amount of detail instruction and supervision . They are the highest paid and considered the most skilled and are supposed to be able to do their work in the best way and in the shortest time . " These comparative efficiencies are based on average performance without any major changes in the equipment or method of doing the work . They therefore reflect the result of the predetermination of a proper  | standard coupled with an incentive to interest the workman in doing his full share toward increased production . The comparisons are all based on former day work efficiencies . In the case of piece-work or premium work , the author 's experience shows that such work on the average is only about 70% efficient . " These facts have been emphasized here to give the reader some general standards as a guide in the development of master control ; likewise , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the industrial engineering field may have some definite check on their standards as they develop them . " Application to Any Job Recognition should be given to the fact that the methods of specialization such as these apply to the work or the job . The operations on a given piece of work can be studied through the performance of any competent operator . Once the instruction card for that work has been prepared , any other competent operator can be trained to do the work and produce the quantity and quality specified . That is , the work has been specialized to permit standardization of the methods and time for its performance . There are numerous cases where jobs that were studied twenty years ago are still being done as they were planned at that time and the standard times then set are still in use . An example of this is at the Ferracute Machine Company . Philip M. Myers , the General Superintendent , in a letter to the author says : " . . . We have hundreds of charts ( of standard times  | and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still in use today . " This is evidence that the specialization of work is independent of the workman . However , to this specialization must be added that of the worker , machine and product that maximum economy may be secured . SPECIALIZATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL Assigning to each worker one or a very few manual or mental operations which he is particularly adapted to perform improves the quality and increases the quantity of output . COROLLARY : As the scope of an executive 's responsibility is narrowed his efficiency increases . The opportunity to specialize human effort is similar to that presented for the specialization of work . As a job is divided into operations the effort of the worker becomes concentrated upon them and the human factor in production , the individual , becomes specialized . This process has been carried to the same length as the specialization of the job . Among skilled workers the crafts indicate the subdivisions or trade specialization . Often individuals from many crafts are found working together . An example is at the yard of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily learned occupations are numbered by the thousand . The Federal Vocational Bureau , which has continued the work of preparing job specifications that was started during the war , now has some 7,500 such  | specifications on file . These indicate what physical and mental qualifications , trade training , skill and experience are necessary to do a specified job . Job Specifications in Manufacturing Plants Many manufacturing concerns have classified and prepared specifications for the various jobs in their plants . The International Harvester Company has about 1,000 such standard specifications covering its manufacturing and raw material activities in the United States and Canada . Each specification gives the " desirable employee 's qualifications " and the " nature and conditions of work . " The use of job specifications is to place men and women in positions for which they are best qualified ? that is , specialize them and direct their efforts where they will be most effective . That these possibilities may be realized , training methods have been developed and widely adopted . A worker with the necessary physical and mental qualifications can be trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is estimated that 60% of industrial workers are either in the unskilled or little trained classes . Foreman Training The foreman training which is receiving attention in all kinds of manufacturing industries is an application of the corollary of this law . It is estimated that every winter season some eight thousand foremen are enrolled in training classes . The purpose is to assist the foreman by organized instruction to deal better with the responsibilities and duties of foremanship.  | SPECIALIZATION OF TOOLS AND MACHINES The attention and skill required to use a tool or operate a machine is inversely as the skill transferred into its mechanism . Manufacturing tools and machinery owe their development in great variety and enormous quantity to the application of this third law of specialization . Through the process of transfer of skill a highly skilled operation may be brought within the capacity of an unskilled worker by making the most difficult parts of the work machine operations . Or an entirely new process adapted to mechanical control may do away with the need for certain human skill which has been long used and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now do work that was formerly done by human craftsmanship . In a very real sense the skill of the workman has been transferred into and resides in the mechanism of the machine . The human skill now required is not to manipulate the material but to tend the tools and machinery that handle the material . Advantages of the Law From the application of this law have come tremendous advantages . No longer is the skill to do work limited by the physical powers of men and women . A man may apply one-tenth or one-eighth of a horsepower to his job . A machine can utilize hundreds or even thousands of horsepower if they are needed.38 Man 's footnote ' F. R. Low in his presidential address to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1924 estimated that the energy exerted by a man  | speed has definite and low limits while a machine can work at any speed for which it is designed ? as an example , a man can walk four miles per hour , an airplane can fly two hundred miles per hour . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day for five or five and a half days per week are about all he will do week in and week out . In contrast , a machine can run on a twenty-four hour schedule and keep it up month after month and year after year with only sufficient shut-down for upkeep and repair . Thus the application of the law of specialization of tools and machines permits the magnification of products , speeding up of the process of production and taking advantage to the full of the flow of time . Changing from Handicraft to Manufacturing The step in the process of changing from handicraft production where all skill resides in the worker to modern manufacturing with skill transferred to mechanism and managerial responsibility to the management is well illustrated by the experience of the collar making industry . The detachable collar for men 's shirts was invented footnote per day in doing work was 2,000,000 foot-pounds . Assuming for ready calculation a working day of 8 1/3 hours , the rate of doing work of the worker on this basis is 4,000 foot-pounds per minute , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated , from a survey conducted jointly by the Electrical World and Power , that some 34,000,000 horsepower of power equipment is installed in American mills and factories . Not all of this is in use at any one time . Therefore , we must assume a use factor . This may be taken at 75% , or the assumption that manufacturing plants are never working above 85% capacity on the average , and that even then the installed power equipment is somewhat in excess of the operating equipment . Applying this 75% use factor reduces the in-use horsepower of American manufacturing plants to a little over 25,000,000 . This represents the power of 200,000,000 men ; or the addition to the effort of every worker in industry of the power of 25 men .  | in 1828 by Hannah Ford Montague , wife of the Reverend Orlando Montague who was very fussy and demanded immaculate linen . Immediately the industry was founded and began to grow . The difficult part of collar making is making the buttonholes . At first these were hand-worked at home by skilled seamstresses who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sent to them from the shops and collected when they were finished . After a time as more collars were needed and few additional skilled seamstresses were available for the work , a buttonhole-making machine was invented . The women bought these machines , set them up in their homes and continued to take work from the shops . But now the buttonholes were machine-made instead of handmade . Gradually these skilled women died and less skilled women had to make buttonholes . They would not buy the machines so the shop bought them and rented them to the women . The work , however , was still done at home . When large-scale production became necessary , the machines were set up in the plant and the buttonhole makers then worked under factory conditions . The skill was now the property of the employer and he had to manage the entire operation . There had been a transfer of executive control along with the acquisition of the ownership of the skill . Steps in Transfer of Skill There can be steps in the process of transfer of skill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | E. P. Blanchard gives an excellent example of such successive steps , taken from machine-shop practice . The piece he selected for the purpose of illustration is a forged steel gear blank 73/4 inches in diameter and 13/4 inches in width of face . The operations to be done upon it are to rough and finish turn all over and bore and ream a hole through the hub . The times for producing one piece are given in the following tabulation assuming that the work is done on four different machines , each more highly organized than its predecessor in reading across the table from left to right . Handicraft Versus Machine Production The ratios of increase per man hour or per day for machine production over handicraft or manual work vary widely . Some are surprisingly large . A few examples give a hint as to what they are . A woman sewing a basting stitch can sew about 70 inches per minute ; a certain commercial sewing machine with multiple heads can sew at the rate of 5,000 inches of seam per minute . A bottle blower makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator can turn out 950 bottles per hour .  | A man threshing wheat with a flail can produce 5 bushels in a ten-hour day . Seven men operating a modern threshing machine can thresh and bag 1,750 bushels in a ten-hour day . The ratio on the basis of the man day is 1 to 50 . The American Society of Agricultural Engineers recently stated that where a man with a walking plow could plow less than 2 acres a day , the same individual with a tractor and three bottom plow can plow from 8 to 12 acres a day . The increase per man production in harrowing with modern power machinery is 300% , in planting 200% , in binder harvesting 100% and in harvesting with a combine as compared with a header 100% . Standardization Follows Transfer of Skill As in the cases of the other laws of specialization , standardization has followed the widespread application of the law of transfer of skill . Commercial machines standardized as to capacities , method of operation and guaranteed output can be bought for almost any repetitive manufacturing operation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis with all its advantages as to quality and low cost . The same situation holds for tools and auxiliary manufacturing equipment . These can be purchased for any purpose and from any one of many makers . A significant trend of recent years is to use more machinery in the office . That is , mechanical equipment to perform mental labor . Machines for this kind of work , where mental skill has been transferred , are regularly on the market .  | SPECIALIZATION OF PRODUCT Concentrating upon the manufacture of a single or a few types and sizes of product tends to improve the quality and lower the production cost . The law of simplification or the specialization of product has been the last of these four laws to receive attention . The process , of course , has been going on throughout the entire development of factory production . Two applications deserve the most attention . The one is specialization of one kind of product that may be made in a variety of sizes and kinds . The other is specialization on a few varieties of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American manufacturing practice . Early Varieties of Products No better illustration of the first application can be given than to compare the variety of products made by the first manufacturer of the Holland Purchase , a territory comprising most of western New York State , with the output of representative manufacturers of today . This pioneer manufacturer , William H. Bush , was lumberman , miller , carder , cloth dresser , papermaker and distiller . He settled near Batavia , New York , in 1806 and founded his six industries during the following eleven years . But let him tell his story of work and success for himself . " I built a log house , covered it with elm bark ? could not spare time to build a chimney . The floor was of slabs and hemlock boards . Immediately commenced  | building a sawmill and had it completed before the middle of October . That summer my wife did the cooking for family and hired men by an out-of-door fire , built up against stumps . " The first winter I attended my own saw mill , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foddering my stock by the light of a lantern . Before winter set in , I had built a stick chimney , laid a better floor in my house , plastered the cracks , and hired an acre of land cleared ? just enough to prevent the trees ' falling on my house . When the mill was built I had it paid for , but to accomplish it I had sold some pork and grain ? in fact , everything but my scanty household furniture . My saw mill proved a good investment ; boards were much in demand at $7.50 per thousand ; the new settlers stocked the mill with logs to be sawed on shares . " In 1808 I built a machine shop , a carding and cloth dressing establishment . These were the first upon the Holland Purchase . On the 10th of June of that year , I carded a sack of wool , the first ever carded by a machine on the Holland Purchase . In February , 1809 I dressed a full cloth , the first ever dressed upon the Holland Purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool . " The machinists may be glad to learn how I procured my machinery . I bought my hand shears of the Shakers at New Lebanon ; my press plate at the furnace in Onondaga ; my screw and box at Canaan , Conn. ; my dye kettle , press papers , etc. , at Albany . My transportation bill for the things was over $200 . " I built a grist mill in 1809 ; in 1817 a paper mill and  | distillery . I manufactured the first ream of paper west of the Genesee River . " Coming into the woods as I have related , dependent almost wholly upon the labor of my hands , in the first twenty years , success had so far attended my efforts , that I had accumulated some fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars . " In contrast with Bush 's activities we have furniture factories that make only one line , as bedroom , living room , or dining room pieces ; a flour mill produces nothing but flour but some have a capacity of 10,000 barrels per day ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paper mills regularly produce only one kind of product , as news print or book papers , and so on . Furthermore we have as an outstanding example of concentration on one variety of product the Ford record of 15,000,000 Model T cars . Specializing on a Few Varieties An example of specializing on a few varieties of a principal line is the experience of the Norwich Pharmacal Company . This concern reduced its line of drugs and pharmaceuticals from four thousand items to four hundred . At the same time the investment and inventory was cut $1,000,000 and some $200,000 was saved on the annual payroll . Further examples of this second process of simplification are found in the records of reduction of varieties by industrial groups . The following four tables are taken from a report of the Division of Simplified Practice of the Department of Commerce .  | figure Herbert Hoover , when Secretary of the Department of Commerce , estimated that simplification or specialization of products that has taken place in this country since 1921 is saving American manufacturers $600,000 , - 000 per year or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specialization tends towards standardization . Standard methods , instructions and times for doing work follow the specialization of work ; standard job specifications follow the specialization of the individual , the worker ; standard machines and tools follow the transfer of skill ; and standards of rating , quality , and proportionality follow the specialization of product . The law formulated to include these various aspects of standardization is :  | Predetermined results , established procedures , and fixed types , sizes and characteristics of product , improve operation and reduce cost of manufacture . COROLLARY 1 : Interchangeable manufacture reduces manufacturing cost and , all other characteristics being equal , produces a product of maximum serviceability . Kimball 's a9 explanation of standardization is : " One of the essentials of cheap production is quantity , and for a given total output the greatest number of each element entering into the product is secured when the number of types and sizes is a minimum . By standardization is meant the reduction of any one line to fixed types , sizes , and characteristics . " E. C. Peck 40 offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of types or sizes which are most suitable , and giving specifications of them in measurable terms so that large quantities can be made which will be uniform . " He also says : " Standardization has for years been recognized as fundamental for mass production . " Interchangeable Manufacture Interchangeability , the " principle of the American system of manufacture , " is outlined by Simeon North , 41 one of its discoverers , in a contract for 20,000 pistols footnote 8 ? Principles of Industrial Organization , p. 41. " ! 0 Management 's Handbook , p. 1001 . " Simeon North , A Memoir , p. 80.  | entered into with the Commissary General of the United States on April 16 , 1813 , as : " The component parts of pistols are to correspond so exactly that any limb or part of one pistol may be fitted to any other pistol of the 20,000 . " In a contract entered into fifteen years later for 5,000 rifles the requirement of interchangeability is even more explicit : 42 " And it is further agreed , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component parts , that any one part , or all parts of either , or any one of the rifles , may be exchanged for its corresponding part or parts , in either or any other rifle made or to be made under this agreement . And also , that the component parts may be exchanged in a similar manner , with the rifles made , or making at the National Armory . The said exchanges to be made without impairing in the least the efficiency or perfection of the arms , which are thus composed of exchanging parts . " Examples of Standardization Little consideration has been given to the standardization of results and procedures compared with that which has been devoted to physical characteristics , yet there are excellent examples of each kind of application of the law . Standard costs and standard times are predetermined results ; standard practice instructions , job specifications and safety codes are standardized procedures ; standard ratings , properties and proportions are physical standards . footnote Ibid. , p. 160.  | Few data are available to show the economic results of standardization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications are usually made gradually . It is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to separate out the effect or evaluate it . Paul E. Holden estimates such savings as hundreds of millions of dollars . " Unlimited examples yet remain to be chronicled with regard to standardization achievements of individual industrial enterprises . Economies and savings to the extent of hundreds of millions of dollars have been realized . A recapitulation of the monetary results of these efforts , of course , never will be made , but it is safe to assume that the aggregate savings , if possible of tabulation , would stagger the imagination . " Standardization of Product It is helpful for an understanding of this law and its numerous applications to consider its corollary which applies to the standardization of products . For out of the application of this law has grown interchangeable design , duplicate manufacture and mass production . John Gaillard and F. E. Schlink have elaborated the law of standardization as it applies to products . Their five statements are given below as corollaries , each accompanied by its own discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corollary in regard to interchangeability has been previously given in connection with the statement of the law . COROLLARY 2 . A standard , in order that it shall raise rather than lower the standard of products , should deal with those elements or principles which are su f -  | ficiently understood and recognized to be stable . It should be concurred in by the most competent experts , so that their consensus as crystallized in the standard can be expected to control production for a reasonable period . However , a standard should deviate to the least possible extent from economical current practice , and where practices vary over a large range , effort should be made to follow the main path of common practice , if thereby economy and utility . do not have to be sacrificed . Evidently , if a standard were " designed " like a new machine , that is , by establishing it anew from the ground up , the one best way would be to choose the most efficient , economical solution for each of its elements . However , standardization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art or industry has been made , and special customs ( " unrecorded standards " ) have been formed . Therefore , when the art has crystallized sufficiently to enable the setting-up of standards , a compromise will generally have to be reached between different solutions already obtained for the same problem . It is often a difficult and delicate work to decide on the best compromise . It will thus be seen that a standard , when analyzed , need not absolutely give the most perfect solution for each of the elementary problems involved , as it may happen that a less valuable solution of one part of the problem has been adopted in order to allow the application of a more important and a more valuable one in respect to another item . COROLLARY 3 . The value of a standard increases rapidly with the extent to which its provisions are  | based upon , and are therefore verifiable by measurement . Therefore , those elements of a standard which depend upon , or are decided by , personal judgment unaided by instrumental measurement , should be reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle , the establishment of a level or reference line from which to measure quality or quantity . It is necessray that the relation between each object falling within the standard , and the standard itself , be expressed by measurement in some definite unit . Therefore , in places where a standard refers to terms such as " reasonable , " " in accordance with the best workmanship , " etc. , it presents weak spots allowing discussion between interested parties or even litigation , whereas one of the purposes of setting a standard is to avoid such discussion . On the other hand , it should always be borne in mind that the accuracy of all measurement is relative , depending , among other things , on the size of the unit of measurement . Consequently , it is desirable and often required that any essential item stated in terms of measurement in a standard be accompanied by tolerance allowing for slight and non-essential deviations from the exact nominal value , as such deviations can not be avoided in human work . COROLLARY 4 . Difficulty of arriving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industry or conditions of application which it must serve and satisfy . It would sometimes appear that the difficulty in setting up a standard increases at a faster rate than the  | number of groups involved in the establishment of the standard . In fact , standardization work must be undertaken with a definite desire to arrive at a solution , and with the willingness to sacrifice part of one 's own interest to the problem under consideration . Here again , but in a different way than mentioned under ( 1 ) , the statement holds good that the standard ultimately set up may not be the one best for a particular group ; but on the other hand , the fact that a standard exists at all , including the stability which such condition brings about , is usually well worth the partial sacrifice of direct interest of each individual group . COROLLARY 5 . Every standard should be subject to revision from time to time in order that it shall continue to reflect the available and applicable knowledge of the art . Standardization does not mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward together in a coordinated manner . Therefore , the desirable procedure is to have the groups which set up a standard get together periodically in order to check up whether any change is necessary , and if so , to have them make that change in the same way as the original standard was set up , that is , by consensus of opinion . COROLLARY 6 . Standardization focuses the attention upon the essential elements of the object under consideration and thereby transfers competition to a field where it has a positive social value . After a standard has been set , all parties interested in the subject , even those who are not experts , will know  | what to look for , and even to a certain extent how to measure the value of the object under consideration . This creates a new situation , as the standard thus lays a sound basis for rational judgment of things by those who , before standardization , had been more or less subject to indefinite and unverified claims made for a product , method , and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole or principal objective . Notably among them are American Engineering Standards Committee , American Electric Railway Association , American Gear Manufacturers Association , American Institute of Electrical Engineers , American Petroleum Institute , American Railway Association , American Society of Mechanical Engineers , American Society for Testing Materials , Association of American Steel Manufacturers , Manufacturers ' Standardization Society of the Valve and Fittings Industry , National Electrical Light Association , National Electrical Manufacturers ' Association , Society of Automotive Engineers . These are all private agencies . The public , or governmental agency of standardization is the National Bureau of Standards . The standards , specifications and codes that have been established by these various bodies have been widely adopted and are extensively used in American engineering and industry . Plant Standardization Progressive manufacturing concerns have been standardizing their products for many years , the work  | extending to factors and elements of machine design , to articles or equipment made in series ( as proportions of screw machine products ) and to ratings ( as horsepowers of electric motors ) . The savings are always considerable from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to four times the cost of the standardization work . The author , when mechanical engineer for the United Shoe Machinery Company , standardized the screw machine parts of that firm 's line of shoe machines with an estimated saving in production cuts of $150,000 per year .  | LAWS OF PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT When work is specialized and broken up into parts and detailed operations , some directing or coordinating agency must make sure that all is done as and when wanted . That agency is the management , the group which makes decisions , gives orders and works for maximum results with the least expenditures of material , time and effort . These physical factors are planned and directed through the application of a group of laws here called the laws of production management . They deal with the control in and through the processes and operations of manufacturing . ECONOMIC PRODUCTION The laws of economic production are framed to consider two situations , the one with production at an increasing relative rate , the other with production at a decreasing relative rate . These laws are : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production decreases when the rate of increase in output increases faster than the rate of input or use of the production factors . 2 . Production at Decreasing Relative Rate : The unit cost of production increases when the rate  | of increase in output increases at a lower rate than the rate of input or use of the production factors , and The unit cost of production increases when the rate of output decreases and the rate of input or use of the production factors increases . COROLLARY : For the same percentage change , the production factor labor alone has three times the effect on production of the production factor fixed capital alone . The term " production factor " is used in these laws in the sense explained by A. Hamilton Church as " any expense that has a definite relation to the cost of production . " 43 These laws of economic production govern the results on manufacturing of efforts to increase at an economic cost the volume of goods needed to satisfy an ever-increasing demand . Different production policies result differently in respect to quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given period can be increased over a former period by methods and policies which are perfectly well known , provided in a former period the methods and policies were less efficient than those now adopted . However , not all combination and manipulation of the production factors yield a proportional increase , and , in fact , an actual decrease may ensue . Thus any one of three conditions may obtain : ( 1 ) Output may increase more than in proportion to the increase in the productive factors ; ( 2 ) Out- footnote " Production Factors , p. 15.  | put may increase , but less than in proportion to the increase in production factors ; ( 3 ) Output may decrease . These conditions operate under the laws of economic production . The 3:1 Ratio of Labor and Capital Charles W. Cobb and Paul H. Douglas have established the ratio of effect of labor and capital on production from a study of the manufacturing production records of the United States Census from 1899 to 1922 . They impute three-fourths of the product for that period to labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant buildings , equipment and machinery . The mathematical proof of this ratio is given in a paper by these economists in The American Economic Review , Vol . XVIII , No. 1 , for March , 1928 , and is the authority for the corollary given above . The period studied includes normal business times , war , boom and depression . Kimball 's Statement of the Laws Dexter S. Kimball has stated these three laws in somewhat different language , having in mind the economic law of diminishing returns : " ( a ) The law of increasing productivity which may be expressed as follows : The wait cost can , in general , be decreased as the quantity to be produced increases . " This follows naturally from the general condition that as quantity is increased greater advantage can be taken of time-saving machinery and division of labor .  | " ( b ) Productive effort usually depends upon the use of several co-ordinate facilities . " In general it is not possible to operate all of the facilities at a high degree of efficiency , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to operate at a comparatively lower rate of efficiency . " ( c ) The law of decreasing productivity may be expressed as follows : Every economic gain is , apparently , accompanied by a corresponding economic loss which tends constantly to neutralize the effect of the economic gain . " Thus the use of division of labor , where applicable , clearly tends toward increased production ; but its use is always accompanied by an extension of supervision which increases the overhead expense ; and if the principle is pushed far enough this increase in expense may more than offset the gain due to increased use of division of labor and a loss may result . Again the progressive installation of refined apparatus in a power plant , for illustration , may result in progressive savings in the fuel bill , but if the interest upon the cost of the new apparatus at any time exceeds the gain in operating costs the point of diminishing returns has been reached . " Cost Reduction The continued efforts at the reduction of manufacturing costs are never-ending applications of these laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input or use of production factors that unit costs shall decrease . Thus changes are made in  | materials both in kind , quality and amount , one kind of labor is substituted for another , improvements are made in tools and machines and better management is encouraged and developed ? all with the purpose of increasing output without increasing the input of production factors to a like degree . The record of American manufacturing during the past decade , under the pressure of keen competition and narrowing profit margins , is a remarkable one from the viewpoint of unit cost reduction . Manufacturing Materials During this period many new materials , or materials capable of adoption in place of older and fully established materials of manufacture , have been produced and are being utilized in increasing quantities . This development has brought about competition between manufacturers whose products formerly did not reach the same markets , has modified many competitive positions and is being referred to as the " new competition . " As an illustration , chemical plants are now making rayon yarn and so are competing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure silk garments finds severe competition from the manufacturer who is turning out rayon hosiery , undergarments and the like , and the former producer of cotton hosiery and undermuslin finds his markets are gone . New England cotton manufacturers have been heard to complain that their girl employees who have been producing muslin for underwear are themselves wearing nothing but silk and so are adding to the distress of their own industry .  | Quite apart from the influence of taste and fashion in women 's garments of this kind , the first law of economic production is influencing the entire situation . The extent of the change is indicated by the figures of rayon production . In round numbers , three million pounds were produced in 1920 and seventy-seven million pounds in 1927 . But rayon is by no means the only striking example of the development and adoption of so-called substitute materials . Artificial leather is being produced to an annual value of some ten million dollars . The leather manufacturers , in fact , have been so alarmed over the growth of these fabrics and compounds now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholstery , luggage , bookbinding and the like that a campaign to promote leather has been inaugurated , having as its slogan , " Nothing takes the place of leather . " Another revolutionary change is seen in the adoption of quick drying lacquer finishes for furniture and automobile bodies . At the close of the war it required from 28 to 30 days to apply the numerous coatings of paint , varnish and enamel to the bodies of motor cars . A quicker drying finish was positively demanded . It was finally developed with a hitherto comparatively valueless product , butyl alcohol , derived from the fermentation of corn . The finishing of an automobile body is now a matter of minutes where before it required days . This same finish is now being extensively used for furniture and various other manufactured articles . Recently the National Cash Register Company installed new processes and equipment for the finishing of cash register cases with a saving of some $75,000 per year .  | New Processes Another field of substitution in the effort to reduce costs is in connection with processes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal articles . This takes the place of mechanical fastenings such as riveting and bolting and permits the use of structural steel parts for more expensive cast iron or cast steel members . It has been applied to the construction of ship hulls , frames of buildings , water mains , pipe lines , and machine elements . C. W. Taylor , vicepresident , The Lincoln Electric Company , gives an example of its application in the manufacture of a rotor spider for an electric motor . Formerly this part was made of cast iron ; the change was to all welded steel . The former cost per piece was $17.88 ; the new cost was $7.21 or a reduction of $10.67 . Changes in Labor Labor , a most important production factor , is continually being investigated , shifted and changed with the purpose of reducing the direct labor cost of manufactured goods . The most striking example of this trend is the substitution of women for men in manufacturing plants during the war . In many places they stayed on and much work formerly considered as belonging to men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same process is seen in the sequence of nationalities in industries of various localities . In New England the first textile workers were of the native stock , of English ancestry and English speaking . They were followed successively by immigrants from northern Europe , by French Canadians and then by Mediter-  | ranean peoples . Each successive group was used to a lower standard of living . With the present restrictions on immigration this process is being pretty well checked . Indirect Labor Control Indirect labor is also brought under minute scrutiny in every well-organized attack on cost reduction . Many substantial savings have been made . A single one will suffice by way of illustration . W. L. Downie , factory accountant , Kelsey Wheel Company , Ltd. , by installing a plan of labor control whereby indirect labor was made to fluctuate in direct proportion to direct labor , reduced the controllable indirect labor by $18,900 in the first twelve months of the operation of the method . This sum was equivalent to 26% of the total item . An example of overall improvement including both direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , Universal Winding Company . The output of this firm is highly organized automatic machinery used in the textile industry . Mr. O'Connor 's excellent record is this : " Since 1912 , therefore , improved methods of management . . . attended by a growth in business to five times the former volume , with 25% increase in floor space and 50% increase in number of employees , have increased the output per employee 100% . " Improvements in Machinery Constant change and improvement has taken place in the production factor , machinery . The trend is toward more highly developed producing machines , greater capacity , more complete automaticity and  | higher speed of operation . Many products are made and packed by the same machine ? the humble household pin is an example . A manufacturer of shoe machinery said that his ideal , unattainable perhaps , was a machine which would take a side of leather at one end and deliver shoes boxed ready for shipment at the other . Many products are already nearly laborless , so small is the amount of labor per unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flour , and artificial ice are examples . As for speed , fine copper wire is now being drawn at the rate of a mile a minute , and numerous shoe machines can operate mechanically much faster than any shoe operator can keep up . New machines are doing away with formerly highly skilled labor or are withdrawing work from less highly specialized machines . Shoe lasting machines have taken the place of thousands of hand lasters and the shoe pulling over machine transferred the skill of the . last highly skilled shoemaking craft to mechanism . Gears are no longer cut a tooth at a time but by hobs or generating mechanism . Both the time of cutting and the cost have been greatly reduced . Innumerable pieces of cylindrical work in machine shops have been taken from engine lathes and put on automatic turret machines with a consequent cost reduction . Thomas R. Hough , industrial engineer , Wilson and Company , tells of the adoption of barrel-making machinery to the production of slack barrels in his plant . The economic result was a 50% cut in labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. H. Gullion , industrial engineer , Swift and Company , made a substantial saving in the packaging of  | several packing house products by introducing machinery to take the place of hand work . In his own words , " As to savings from the use of this equipment ? the lard group saved 21 employees and the several sliced bacon machines 20 employees . The combined savings , both labor and supplies for lard , cheese , sliced bacon and oleomargerine are conservatively estimated at $80,000 per year . The cost of all this machinery installed was about $60,000 . There have also been accompanying advantages of improvement in quality , appearance and convenience of the packages . " Improvements in Plant Other attempts to reduce costs by improving production factors have been directed at the plant and its fixed equipment . One of these , the betterment of artificial illumination , will serve as an illustration . The amount of illumination supplied on the working area has steadily increased during the past few years . Where formerly 10 to 12 foot-candles were considered a maximum , 20 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in production attributable to the better lighting . Roy A. Palmer declares that by spending 2% of the annual payroll for modern lighting equipment , production can be increased 10% to 12% . He cites a number of instances of even greater gains . " One of the most convincing tests was conducted at the Columbus plant of the Timken Roller Bearing Company in the inspection department . The original lighting system supplied about 2 foot-candles on the work . The distribution of light was not uniform and  | the shadows were bad . Daylight from windows and overhead skylight supplemented the artificial illumination so that a total of about 5 foot-candles was obtained . " The new lighting system consisted of modern metal-glass reflectors spaced 8 by 10 ft. apart and mounted 12 ft. from the floor . The windows and skylight were darkened to exclude daylight and lamps were installed to supply 5 foot-candles of illumination ? the level provided by the original lighting system and daylight . It is interesting to note that an increase in output of 3.4% resulted under the new system although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Better distribution of light and freedom from glare and annoying shadows improved vision that reacted in greater production . " During the period of the test which extended over ten weeks , levels of 6 , 13 and 20 foot-candles were supplied by using larger lamps . At 6 foot-candles , production increased 4% . When 13 foot-candles were supplied , the output was 8% greater . Raising the level of illumination to 20 foot-candles produced a 12.5% greater production . The illumination was not raised from one level to a higher level in progressive order . Instead , the levels were interspersed so as to get a more definite reaction . This feature makes this test one of the most interesting , for as the level of illumination was raised , lowered , and raised again , production increased and decreased accordingly . " At the Dover Manufacturing Company illumination was increased from about 4 to 13.5 foot-candles on the work with an increase in production of 12.5% . The Detroit Piston Ring Company doubled this record ,  | making an increase in production of 25% when modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the effect of constructive improvement in the utilization of production factors in manufacturing and indicate how they affect production costs under the operation of the laws of economic production . MASS PRODUCTION The laws of mass production are : 1 . Large-scale production tends to increase operating efficiency and competitive power . 2 . In large-scale production the unit time of production tends to approach the actual operating time as a limit . A remarkable fact in the development of manufacturing is the increase in the size of factories and industrial enterprises . The advantages of large size are : reduced cost of production , relatively smaller reserves to meet contingencies , and a stronger position in competition . The first of these is due to the greater opportunity to apply fully the laws of specialization ; the second to the greater fluidity of stores of materials and tools and stocks of goods ; the third to enlarged prestige , influence and personnel ability . Dexter S. Kimball says of it : " The prestige and influence of a large factory assist materially in selling product , largely because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large organization can afford to hire a better class of men especially for the higher positions of ad-  | ministration and design . A large enterprise also is in a better position to acquire patents and trade secrets . The advantages were , no doubt , appreciated before the present industrial era by the masters of the handicraft factories , as records clearly show . " Kimball also states and explains the second law : " With increasing numbers the unit time tends to approach the actual operation time as a limit . This principle , which holds true whether these values are measured in time or in dollars is , in fact , the basic principle of mass production and the larger the number that are to be made the greater the time and money that can be economically expended upon preparation and planning , provided , of course , that the product can be disposed of as fast as produced . " Extent of Mass Production An indication of the extent of mass production is given by the percentage of all factory workers employed in establishments , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1919 and has remained approximately stationary thereafter . However , during the same period there has been an increase in the proportion of workers in plants employing 501 or over and 1,001 or over . The figures from the census of manufacturers are these : figure Mass production , or the American system of manufacture , as it is known abroad , is so woven into the  | operation of manufacturing that its comparative advantages can not be evaluated . Through its application , costs approach their ultimate low point for any given set of operating conditions . And further it permits of establishing costs in line with predetermined selling prices which will bring maximum distribution and satisfactory profit . Edward A. Filene , in discussing this latter point , has said : " It is safe to say that if the Ford and Chevrolet cars sold today at $1,000 each , the cost of producing them would be at least 25 per cent higher than it is . For two reasons : " First , the market for them would be too restricted to make possible the great economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so wide a margin to play with ' that the incentive to eliminate every possible waste would be lacking . " SIMULTATION OR COORDINATION To obtain the minimum production time or the maximum output per unit of time , it is necessary to perform many operations simultaneously . The governing laws are : 1 . The minimum overall production time for a group of operations , or for the operations on an item of product , is obtained by the maximum overlapping , or simultaneous performance , of the several work wnits. 2 . The minimum overall production time for a group  | of simultaneous operations tends to approach the time of the longest work unit as its limit . By work unit is meant an operation or part of an operation that can not practically be subdivided further under the prevailing conditions of performance . Application of the Law E. P. Blanchard of the Bullard Machine Tool Company , who formulated this law , based his presentation on machine operation . It is evident , however , that this fundamental applies broadly to all manufacturing work . This law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and assembly control boards and the scheduling of work , on the one hand , and the design of machines which perform simultaneous operations , on the other . Blanchard explains it in this way : " A bar of a given diameter to be turned in a lathe by the single-tool process would mean that one tool must travel the entire length , the production time being T. With a tool slide design that would mount three tools equally spaced along the length of cut and all operating at the same time , the total accumulated tool time would be the same , but the production time would be represented by . In this simple case , 3 is the factor of simultation . " He further gives a comparison of machining times for a gear blank on various types of machine tools , to show how production time is reduced by the application of this law . The blank has a finished diameter of 73/4 inches ; width of face 13/4 inches ; bore 1% inches , and is finished all over . The comparable times for production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chucker and multimatic are shown in the preceding table . It is the application of this law that coordinates the operations on an automobile assembly chain , in the manufacture of electric light bulbs , or in the operation of a spinning frame or a loom . Its application becomes necessary so soon as the laws of specialization have operated to subdivide work and human effort and transfer skill to the machine . PLANNING OR MENTAL LABOR OF PRODUCTION The law of planning may be stated as follows : The mental labor of production is reduced to a minimum by planning before work is started , what work shall be done , how the work shall be done , where the work shall be done , and when the work shall be done . Kimball writes : " " They ( management engineers ) aim to do the mental labor of production in a separate planning department and to predict the results of productive processes in a manner analogous to that in which the engineering department conducts the scientific part of machine design . " The planning of industrial operations involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; how the work shall be done ; where the work shall be done ; and , lastly , when the work shall be done . " " footnote " Principles of Industrial Organization , p. 48 . " Ibid. , p. 143.  | PRODUCTION CONTROL The law of production control is : The highest efficiency in production is obtained by producing the required quantity of product , of the required quality , at the required time , by the best and cheapest method . Kimball46 in discussing the coordinating mechanism of production control writes : " In certain production enterprises , however , there is , in addition , a much more difficult problem , namely , that of controlling production so that the required product shall be produced in the best and cheapest method ; that it shall be of the required quality , and that it shall be produced in the required time . " Of all the mechanisms of management in manufacturing no others have had so much study , development and use as those which apply to the control of production . From Frederick W. Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devising ways and methods whereby production would be forthcoming when and as needed . In spite of all this work and the extensive dissemination of management knowledge or production control methods , remarkable progress is being steadily made . Production Control Results No better means can be used to show what the results of production planning and control are than to give a group of statements from industrial executives who footnote " Principles of Industrial Organization , p. 136.  | have installed such methods . The several quotations that follow are from a variety of industries and cover a widespread geographical range . Lawrence P. Fisher , president and general manager , Cadillac Motor Car Company , in telling how Cadillac doubled its plant output said : " During the past two years , therefore , the Company has accomplished the stupendous job of putting two new models into production , with an increase in total annual output of from 22,000 cars to a possible 50,000 to 60,000 cars , or over 100% . " This vast increase in manufacturing capacity has been brought about in the same total floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LaSalle assembly plant , by a more intensive use of the manufacturing area . More efficient use of production equipment , development of improved types of machinery , rearrangements of plant and departmental layout , and better methods of material handling have so greatly facilitated production that the increased output has been attained with an addition of about 24% to the working force . " A. B. Kibble , manager of production control , Plant No. 2 , Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company , testifies to the advantageous results of production control in handling continuous processes : " The Goodyear plant is three times as efficient today ( 1927 ) as it was when the improvement in production control was commenced seven years ago . Developments are still producing equally remarkable results , and the Company has demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that production control can be made a corn-  | plete success in continuous process industries even in the face of wide variation in seasonal demand . " William L. Walker , vice president , The Washburn Company , a concern manufacturing wire specialities and wire hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases of from 100% to 200% : " Through the planning and routing control described , together with the development of standard tasks for performance in the plant by the time and motion study division , the Company has been able to increase the production per employee-hour more than 100% . This statement is based upon many actual records of performance on individual jobs , using the same equipment ; upon the earnings of the employees working on the various jobs , compared with the time allowed as standard ; upon the total volume of production obtained in the plants belonging to the company , compared with hours of labor ; and upon the comparisons of costs of goods produced . In making the calculations for total volume or production , as related to physical volume and money volume , for several years back , corrections have been made for the changes in earnings of the employees and for costs of materials . The increases in production shown in three of the plants belonging to the company are much in excess of the above estimate of 100% . In one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assistant director of production and stores , Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company , Mansfield plant , has increased production 300% in manufacturing extremely diversified lines of product . He indicates some of the difficulties of the task :  | " From the start we were confronted with the difficulties of manufacturing extremely diversified products with the same equipment and facilities . Our products classify into four lines of electrical apparatus , each with certain items made under mass production , others seasonally , and still others as repeat orders . Each line has also its job lots , its special orders and its replacement parts . " The four lines we produce are : 1 . Domestic heating appliances , including the sad iron , turnover toaster , waffle baker , percolator , " cozyglow " heater , and many other electrical devices now common in the home . 2 . Electrical ranges , in a variety of groups and sizes for the home , apartment , hotel , restaurant , etc. 3 . Safety switches , from the control switch for the lines in the home to the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial cooking devices , from the small heater used in vulcanizing automobile tires to the complete oven and heat-treating furnaces for all kinds of industrial demand . " One case will illustrate the wide spread between items in any one line . Safety switches are regularly produced for stock in 18 different types , and in a number of sizes and variations in each type . All told , there are about 450 individual kinds of switches made , many of which will be in production at the same time . " Mr. Beattie also sums up the gains and results : " The ability to change monthly to the new month 's load , without interrupting the work in any department  | while making the adjustments , is perhaps the most outstanding advantage secured . At the same time , raw material inventories have been cut 73% and work-inprocess inventories 57% . That is , we have reduced our stocks of fabricated parts and raw materials 65% , while increasing production 300% . " A Measure of Effectiveness Turning back to the statement of the law of production control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of production control is available in the comparison between the number of orders promised for delivery on specified dates and those actually shipped on those dates . It is a fair assumption , of course , that when such an order is shipped , it is of the " required quantity " and " required quality . " The records of six manufacturing concerns that have made such a comparison are given below : figure The record of the Ferracute Machine Company , which is over 100% , is not as absurd as it may seem at first thought . Advantage has been taken in computing this percentage of those cases where shipment was made before the date promised .  | LAWS OF MATERIAL MANAGEMENT Manufacturing is transforming raw materials or partly manufactured materials into goods for commerce . Therefore , the managing of materials becomes a most important part of the manufacturing process and the laws of material management and control are equal in significance to those of production control . The point of first attack in the development of management in manufacturing was production . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods of the former were given early consideration and quickly brought to a high degree of perfection . MATERIAL CONTROL The laws of material control governing both the utilization and storage of materials , tools and supplies are : 1 . The highest efficiency in the utilization of materials is obtained by providing the required quantity , of the required quality and condition , at the required time and place . 2 . The highest efficiency in the storage of materials , tools , and supplies is obtained by providing a definite place to store every item , keeping every item in its  | assigned place , and keeping an adequate record thereof . 3 . Quickening material turnover reduces the expense of material control . Henry L. Gantt forcefully emphasized the importance of the first law by giving as his opinion that : " Two-thirds of all the gain possible through the most efficient management ( of production ) could be realized by having all the material ready when you want it , where you want it , and in the condition you want it . " 4z The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been drilled into children of every generation : " Have a place for everything and keep everything in its place " ; while the third law points out one way to lessen the danger of obsolescence . In regard to the situation presented by the third law , Rexford Guy Tugwe1148 has this to say : " Quicker turnover has obvious good results . If , in proportion to the amounts of goods sold , fewer are carried in stock , many items of expense are reduced . Insurance may be carried for a shorter time , there is less deterioration in quality , changes in the type of goods wanted are less likely to occur , improvements in technique which make the goods obsolete are less frequent , and the danger of loss of profits from price changes is less serious . " Material Control Results Balance of stores records and perpetual inventories are commonly found in any well-managed manufactur- footnote ' n Materials and Their Handling , Joseph W. Roe , p. 4 . " Industry Coming of Age , p. 161.  | ing establishment . So accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , that an agreement of 1/2 of 1% between the quantities indicated by the paper records and the physical inventory is not at all uncommon . A striking instance of this control of material inventories is given by Rear Admiral T. H. Hicks of the Supply Corps , United States Navy . On a monthly report covering fifteen and three-quarters million dollars ' worth of supplies in stores the stock card records showed a gain on some items totaling $851.47 and a total loss on other items of $313.89 . That is , the discrepancy was only about five hundred dollars . Figure 2 shows a monthly bulletin of inventories and trial balances giving not only the gains and losses for a considerable number of classes of supplies in stores but also giving the cost of making the original inventory , of its verification , of making the original trial balance , and of its verification . Stock Turnover Results The Liquid Carbonic Company increased its material stock turnover from 1.9 times per year in 1923 to 3.4 times per year in 1927-1928 . This was brought about largely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock were eliminated and the policy of simplification applied to the 14,000 that remained . E. P. Miller , production manager , has this to say in regard to the improvement : " Our average stock turnover in 1923 was about 1.9 times per year ; for the ten months of the current fiscal year ( 1927-1928 ) where we have figures for it , it is  | over 3.4 times a year . It has almost doubled in the four years . " Taking the usual carrying charges of 12% for interest and depreciation on the stock , we are saving a very substantial amount each year on the stock we would have had to carry at the old turnover rate to handle our volume this year . And this figure does not take adequate account of the new business which the released investment enables us to get , nor does it take account of the increased liquidity of our working capital . " H. L. Benedict , president , Benedict Manufacturing Company , increased his material turnover from 0.86 to 1.31 times per month and at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the range 45% to 52% and reduced factory costs 20% . Inventory Reduction From 1923 to 1926 the Packard Motor Car Company reduced the value of its inventory of materials and finished parts from $12,000,000 to $3,000,000 . At the same time the output of cars was increased from 50 to 150 per day . The proportionate reduction of inventory is , therefore , 12 to 1 . John Younger , in discussing the application of these laws in the operation of the Ford industries , has this to say : " Mr. Ford credits this policy and the use of these facilities with a 75% reduction in the inventory of raw materials and finished products . Basing his comparison on conditions when he was producing Model T cars at  | the rate of 2,000,000 per year , a record he expects soon to equal with Model A , he says : " If we were operating today under the methods of 1921 , we should have on hand raw materials to the value of about $120,000,000 and we should have unnecessarily in transit finished products to the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment in raw materials and finished goods of not far from $200,000,000 . Instead of that , we have an average investment of only about $50,000,000 , or , to put it another way , our inventory , raw and finished , is less than it was when our production was only half as great . ' " QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION The laws that govern the control of quality in manufacturing and the operations of inspecting the product are : 1 . The quality of manufactured goods is a variable with an upward trend under conditions of competitive manufacture . 2 . Control of quality increases output of salable goods , decreases costs of production and distribution , and makes economic mass production possible . 3 . The inspection function in manufacturing ( measuring and judging production ) for highest efficiency must be independent of but coordinate with the functions of engineering , production and sales . George S. Radford , who probably has written more than any other engineer on the fundamentals and  | methods of quality control , presents the purpose of the first law in these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , amounting almost to an unformulated law of economics . When production outstrips consumption , competition enters to elevate the standard ; when once the purchaser has become familiar with the better grade , his subsequent demand is for at least as good as before . This movement toward higher quality is not entirely continuous , as there are recurring cycles when consumption is greater than production , and quality is allowed to drop to the level which will be accepted . But even these retrograde movements do not carry the standard back to the previous low level as will be evident from comparing nearly any product of a generation ago with current production . " 49 In regard to the second law as stated above Radford is equally explicit and positive : " It becomes insidiously easy to reason that quality , of necessity , costs more to produce . From this false premise the manufacturer may , and often does , conclude that quantity , rather than quality of output , is his first aim as a producer . " As a matter of fact , the reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of itself ? and output of salable goods increases , costs of production and selling decrease ; and quality establishes the market which makes possible quantity production with its attendant advantages . " 60 footnote " Management 's Handbook , p. 700. " 0 Ibid. , p. 701.  | On the third law we once more turn to Radford for a clear and satisfying explanation : " He ( the inspector ) enforces quality by refusing to accept poor work , but this act of rejection is passive as regards enforcing the production of good work . Quality or lack of it must necessarily be worked into the material by the production department which controls production processes . This principle may be summarized by stating that the inspector does not make goods , consequently the responsibility for the quality produced rightly rests with the manufacturing department . " And further : " Of equal importance is the principle that inspection must be conducted as an independent function . . . . As applied to the factory proper this means that inspection must be independent of production and , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufacturing ? engineering and production.61 Examples of Quality Control No better illustration of the application of the first and second laws can be cited than the experience of the automobile industry . The improvement in quality of motor cars has been steady and continuous with increasing keenness of competition . And the control of quality has been brought to as high a level of excellence in automobile manufacture as can be found in any industry in the United States . Lawrence P. Fisher , president , Cadillac Motor Car Company , has said in a recent magazine article that on the Cadillac car there are 36,000 operations where the permissible limit of variation from nominal size is 0.002 footnote 61 Management 's Handbook , p. 709.  | inch , 22,000 operations where the limit is 0.001 inch , and 800 operations where the limit is 0.00025 to 0.0005 inch , Such limits , many of which are of the order of a quarter of a thousandth of an inch , can not be established and maintained except by well-organized quality control . Another concern that has an enviable reputation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoll , vice-president , has this to say about his firm 's methods of controlling quality : " Our control of quality begins with the inspection of raw material , embraces the careful watching of tools and machinery , a considerable amount of inspection on parts-in-process and an extensive check-up on the finished product . In an overall check , inspection on a small percentage of the entire product is made by an entirely separate organization to ensure the maintenance of a general level of quality . " Means are also provided so that the trends and the results of our inspection work can be visualized . This is accomplished by means of quality reports which are maintained for each major line of our product . " One of these quality reports in graphical form is shown in Figure 3 . Note that most of the records plotted show a " pass inspection " of more than 94% . FLOW OF WORK The past few years has seen an increasing amount of attention given to the flow of work in manufacturing . The governing law reads : The greatest economy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | materials move a minimum distance in passing from operation to operation . Kimball discusses this fundamental under the heading " Plant Planning Flow " : " It will be obvious that greatest economy in transporting the material through the plant will result when the several departments and buildings are so managed with reference to each other that the material shall be moved along with a minimum amount of traveling and handling and so that the factory shall work smoothly as a whole . " 52 Proper factory layout and building planning for manufacture are now recognized as productive of such economies that it is often said : The possible cost reduction will justify abandoning an old plant and building a new . Straight line production is usually most economical , by which is meant that the production does not back track but moves forward from operation to operation in a direct minimum length line conducive to a thin rapidly flowing stream . Examples of Modern Layout Harold H. Clark , superintendent of engineering , Dunlop Tire and Rubber Corporation , in Figure 4 shows the layout of the Tonawanda plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently built tire factories in this country . The routing of materials in straight lines is indicated . He claims outstanding benefits from the adoption of this layout , the principal one being a lowering of manufacturing costs . footnote " Principles of Industrial Organization , p. 76.  | Another application of this law quite different in method but with equally satisfactory results has been made by H. H. Edge , works manager , Kelly Press Division , American Type Founders Company . His method consisted in classifying the work of the shop figure into two groups according to the kind of operation to be performed and then arranging a floor for each kind where it could be manufactured with a minimum of handling and moving . " All machining work was given a primary classification as either round or flat . The first floor was Garage Garage  | set aside for round work , and the second floor ; or receiving level , for flat work and the tool equipment was arranged to correspond with this general plan . " Likewise the various operations on the component parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in general , so the larger and heavier ones moved from one machine to an adjacent tool without the necessity for trucking . In this way the bulk of the heavy planers , slab millers , shapers , etc. , were grouped . " The division of the work with two general classes and the arrangement of the machines as here outlined are practical and so easily understood that there has been little or no confusion in getting them in operation . It has reduced our trucking of parts in process over 50% , and has been very helpful to us in increasing production and reducing manufacturing costs . " An Example for Diversified Products An excellent example of the application of the law of flow of work to the manufacture of diversified products is afforded by the Mansfield plant of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company . Here four principal lines of product are turned out . Domestic heating devices Electric ranges Safety switches Industrial and commercial cooking apparatus The plant is conveyorized to reduce handling and assist in production control . As a result of this mechanical improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of material production and stores , manufacturing costs have been reduced and production increased . The cost reduction on one household article , a thermostatic flat iron , was so satisfactory that the consumer price was reduced by $1 . The stocks of raw materials and fabricated parts have been reduced 65% and at the same time production increased 300% . The personnel of the production control department has also been reduced from 33 to 25 persons . One-Third More Output E. D. Smith , maintenance engineer , and T. A. Keefer , foreman , Factory Layout Department , National Cash Register Company , recently completed the installation of new equipment to handle the cabinets or metal covers of cash registers through the enameling process . The success of this new scheme and the accompanying equipment hinged on improved layout . The resulting advantages , all of which are substantial , are these : " 1 . Maximum possible output increased from 600 to 800 complete cabinets per day while required floor space was reduced 10,000 sq . ft. 2 . Annual payroll ( 700 units per day ) reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 625 to 150 , or 76% ; remaining trucks being necessary for special finish and black japan work . 4 . Time of cabinets in department reduced from 7 ? days to 1 ? days .  | 5 . Number of handlings reduced from 58 to 20. 6 . Improved quality of product due to decreased handling . 7 . Better working conditions due to elimination of congestion at certain points . 8 . Uniform baking conditions due to parts being continually in motion while in ovens . 9 . Release of elevator service badly needed for other departments . 10 . Reduction of inventory , finished and process stock , by 80% . " From 1,100 to 200 men An outstanding example of coordinating the operations of manufacturing into a continuous flow is afforded by the A. O. Smith Automatic Plant , which produces automobile frames . The total time required from raw material through the enameling of the finished product is one hour and fifty minutes . The daily capacity is in excess of 7,000 frames . All handling and conveying are mechanically done . Due to this layout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $10,000,000 , the working force for the same output has been reduced from 1,100 to 200 men . A. F. Denham outlines the manufacturing problem that has been so satisfactorily solved in this manner : 5a " The construction of this plant presented a huge engineering problem , since there was no installation in existence which could be used as a guide , and it was necessary to synchronize 552 operations for the average frame at a desired speed of 360 frames per hour , aggre- footnote " Automotive Industries , March 17 , 1928 , p. 437.  | gating approximately 4,000,000 operations in the day 's production of 7,000 or more frames . " In practice the entire plant works as a single mechanical unit synchronized and correlated from the feeding end of the sheet steel to the emerging of the completed frame . One of the interesting features is that practically any size and type of automobile frame can be produced , only about 10 hours for 200 men being required to change over the plant from the production of one to another type and size . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this plant is one hour and fifty minutes , 90% of which is represented by the time taken up in conveying materials from point to point . " Importance of Flow Control In the manufacturing progress that has been made in the United States since 1919 it is probable that the most influential technical change has been in connection with the control of the flow of work . Conveyors or other material handling devices installed to move the work from place to place or to set the pace of production have been applied in all branches of manufacturing . As one result the speed of production is wholly or partially determined by the speed of the mechanical device . This has tended to ease the burden and care of supervision , has made scheduling and dispatching automatic , has extended the process of specialization of both work and worker , and made the time of production definitely predictable . Had it not been for this development , it is probable that American manufacturers would have had serious  | difficulty in maintaining mass production methods for the output of the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion changes and the policy of current buying . It is probable that when the advantages of the control of the flow of work-in-process are more fully realized that this law will be consciously applied to a far greater extent . Herein is one of the foundations of the belief that the output per man-hour will be substantially increased and unit manufacturing cost substantially decreased during the coming decade .  | LAWS OF INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVITY The process of specialization whereby the effort of the worker is concentrated on a single or a very few operations has led to an intensive study of the methods and conditions of doing work with the purpose of finding the " one best way . " Several able and eminent investigators have conducted research in this field , notably The Gilbreths . A small group of fundamentals has been established that are of special value in increasing and improving the output of the individual worker . These have been discovered largely through experiment and therefore have had a somewhat different development than other management laws . INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVITY The law which governs the selection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual productivity , is : The highest individual productivity is possible only when the worker is given the highest class of work for which his natural abilities fit him . Frederick W. Taylor repeatedly stressed this law , saying that its application should be a principal aim of  | every employer and in every manufacturing establishment . Quoting : " It would seem to be the duty of employers , therefore , both in their own interest and in that of their employees , to see that each workman is given as far as possible the highest class of work for which his brains and physique fit him . " 54 Similar emphasis has been given to this fundamental by James Hartness when he writes : " The welfare of all men , from the Napoleons of industry to the newest recruit into the work , should be so considered that each man should have the best work for which his endowment and general characteristics fit him . " We lift up a man when we take a worker whose greatest achievement has been to handle a shovel inefficiently and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which he creates more value ? and one in which he can obtain a better wage for himself and family . If his brain is not made to guide a nation , this work may not be so degrading as it may seem . The work for each should be the highest type available for him . " 55 Vocational Guidance Upon this law of individual productivity is based one of the most important of the activities of personnel directors , namely , vocational guidance . It is evident that before a worker can be given the highest kind of work for which his natural abilities fit him that those abilities must in some way be investigated and eval- footnote Shop Management , p. 28. ' 5 Human Factor in Works Management , pp. 28 and 29.  | uated . To this end many tests of intelligence and aptitude have been devised and tried . As yet practice has not become stabilized nor have any particular methods become generally accepted . However , the extent of the experimental work already done and now under way , the numerous attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the evident possible benefits from scientific selection of workers show the importance of the law . In this situation it is evidently impracticable to present quantitative facts or even convincing case material to show how the law has been applied and what results have been obtained . What we do know , however , is that there has been a steady up-grading of employees in American manufacturing establishments since 1919 . ACQUIRING SKILL There are three laws which relate to the acquisition of skill in doing work . Law of Speed ( or Facilitation ) : As the newly acquired nerve path is strengthened , the new response tends to proceed more rapidly . Law of Accuracy ( or Elimination ) : As the new connections between impressions and memories improve , there are fewer useless and erroneous movements , the response becomes more precise and more accurate .  | Law of Learning : Under usual condition 's an average worker acquires skill rapidly during the first half of the training period , then more slowly for a time , if at all , and finally at a rapid rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these laws are called the laws of habit formation . Carle M. Bigelow recognized the third after analyzing several thousand cases of training in manufacturing operations , principally the training of girls in textile mills . His reference to it is : " We believe that we have discovered an absolute fact , that for the average worker , when he or she has covered about one-half the normal training period , there then must be expected a period of time , depending upon the nature of the work , where progress or increase in skill practically ceases . Then after a short while , he attains the balance of average proficiency very rapidly . " S6 If the progress of learning as indicated by this law is plotted by a curve , the increase of skill will rise sharply at first then will come a period of no or little progress represented by a flat ( plateau ) , this in turn being followed by another rise . That is , the plateau will be seen between two rather steep slopes . Progress in Folding Asphalt Shingles Joseph A. Piacitelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual workers and also footnote " Management 's Handbook , p. 962.  | of groups of workers . From the results of his investigations Figures 5 and 6 have been taken . The curves of both show similar characteristics , although the first is for two crews of four men each folding 16-inch asphalt shingles and the second is for one of these men . The lower dotted line of the first graph , Figure 5 , represents the six-day progressive average of the rate of output of a new crew immediately after new methods of feeding and packing were installed . The upper full  | line on the graph is for a second crew working and learning under slightly different conditions . In each case the new methods were established after careful study . The second chart , Figure 6 , gives the learning curve of one of the new men on this work . It is characteristic of the learning curves of individuals , having the rapid rise at first then the fiat or plateau followed by another rise .  | Results of Employee Training The economic results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the work of James F. Johnson . Mr. Johnson has had extensive experience in training workers and in installing training methods . The first case shown here is the record of a man being trained to operate a Jones and Lamson turret lathe ; the second is for a garment worker ; the third is of a group of power sewing machine operators ; while the fourth and last is of a worker performing a sawing operation in the manufacture of buttons . Improvement of Turret Lathe Operator The curves on the chart , Figure 7 , were made from average records of a group being trained to operate two-spindle Jones and Lamson turret lathes . The usual time taken to reach the required production of fifteen pieces per hour on this particular job was about fourteen days . The average progress as represented by the increased hourly production from day to day when the man was " broken in " on the factory floor is shown by the curve at the right . When organized training was installed in this shop it was decided to transfer one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators were to be trained and were to be requisitioned by the factory when needed . The purpose was to prevent , if possible , the usual drop in production due to the green operator with its accompanying wastes and delays . If there was no opening on the factory floor after a new operator was trained , he was kept in the training division but was paid at regular factory rates until an opening developed .  | The average progress of a group of men while being trained on the Jones and Lamson turret lathe under these conditions is indicated by the curve at the left . While in training each man was paid $2.25 a day . When the time taken for training was reduced approxi-figure mately 58% , the amount saved in wages in bringing each operator up to production was about $20 . Decrease in Labor Turnover The curve of Figure 8 was plotted from the employment office records of a garment factory to show the dropping out of new workers who were first trained in a separate training department and then transferred  | to the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which they had been trained . The curve relates to new work only . About the time systematic intensive training was introduced in this factory the monthly turnover among the new employees was approximately 20%. figure One of the requirements in the training program was that every worker should be carefully selected for the job upon which he or she was to be trained . Thus , before the applicant was finally employed she was given a short practical machine test in an effort to eliminate awkward clumsy individuals , those who were " lefthanded , " afflicted with weak eyes , or having " machine fear . " The effect of these methods was immediate and  | a better quality of workers began to be introduced into the organization . Not only did they develop faster and better under instruction , but they stuck on the job longer as shown by the curve . At the end of a twelvemonth period the turnover among the employees who had been through the training room was about 3%. figure It is difficult to estimate the accompanying savings but they were considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earnings of power sewing machine operators is given by Figure 9 . Here curve 1  | was plotted from the records of a group of new workers who were put on the job in the factory in the usual manner . That is , they were selected from applicants in an employment office , sent to the department foreman and put to work . The record is for a period of about eleven weeks showing the progress during that period . The average line indicates a maximum daily earning of about $2.12 . Curve 2 on the same chart shows the actual earnings of a group of workers while under organized instruction on the same line of work in the same factory but in a separate training division . Progress that formerly took from ten to twelve weeks is now made in less than half that time . Training cost was reduced 56% and the records also showed that the workers trained under organized instruction stayed much longer on their jobs . Reducing Wastage The graphical record of Figure 10 is from a sawing operation in the manufacture of buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average spoilage of a group of workers who were assigned directly to their jobs and placed under the direction of an assistant foreman . At length several end machines in the department were set aside for organized training purposes . Those workers who were struggling along were assigned to these machines under the instruction of a man who had been previously trained to teach such workers . The average of the defective work turned out before organized training ran about 111/2% . So soon as training was started this percentage dropped as shown by the dotted curve at the right in Figure 10 , finally averaging  | figure 13/4% for a period sufficiently long to show that correct working habits had been established . The approximate improvement was 85% . HAND MOTIONS GILBRETII The research work to discover the " one best way " has yielded five laws of hand motions which are as follows : 1 . Both hands should work and rest at the same time . 2 . Both hands should begin and complete their " therbligs " at the same instant . 3 . The arms should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths of fast motions should be taught and learned . 5 . The sequence of fewest " therbligs " is usually the best way of doing work . These laws were disclosed in a paper 57 by Frank B. and Lillian M. Gilbreth , based upon the researches of these two investigators . A therblig is an element of a cycle of motions . Seventeen are recognized : 1 . Search 2 . Find 3 . Select 4 . Grasp 5 . Position 6 . Assemble 7 . Use 8 . Disassemble 9 . Inspect 10 . Transport loaded 11 . Preposition 12 . Release load 13 . Transport empty 14 . Wait ( unavoidable delays ) 15 . Wait ( avoidable delays ) 16 . Rest ( to overcome fatigue ) 17 . Plan Motion Study Results An instructive comparison of the improvement due to a change in methods in keeping with the indications footnote Bulletin of Society of Industrial Engineering .  | of motion study and the application of the laws of hand motions is afforded by two plants of the Barber Asphalt Company , one at Maurer where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison where the former methods were continued in use . Joseph A. Piacitelli has given the record in the improvement in the packing of asphalt shingles presenting it in the form of a chart which compares the production of the two plants . The rates of production of the 12-inch and 16-inch shingles have been increased to 12% and 20% , respectively , above the rate of the Madison plant where the principles of motion study have not been applied , nor have the methods of doing this work been standardized . " The unit cost of folding 12-inch Latites has been reduced 23% , while that of the 16-inch has been reduced 22% . " The earnings of the men have increased 60% when producing the 12-inch Latites and 51% when producing the 16-inch shingles . " Motion studies were made of other operations , such as cutting and packing 10-inch , 12 ? - inch , and extra heavy strip shingles ; cutting and packing regular and extra heavy individual shingles , and in each case we did not fail to effect economies in production , primarily by reducing labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Figure 11.  | MOTION TIME ( SEGUR ) The law of motion time discovered within the past three years is : Within practical limits the times required by all expert workers to perform true fundamental motions are constant . This law was discovered and has been formulated by A. B. Segur and is an outgrowth of an extensive series of motion study investigations . It provides means to determine the base or standard time for performing operations from the required fundamental motions and without using either time studies or motion picture studies . Its application within practical limits is independent of sex , job , place or condition . By " practical limits " is meant those that usually surround the doing of work , and motions taking longer than 0.0001 minute to complete . It is not claimed that the law applies to mental work . By " true fundamental motions " is meant the therbligs classified by Gilbreth . To apply this law Segur has developed methods of motion time analysis and further training of workers in a sequence of fundamental motions . Results of Motion Time Application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has given a statement of the savings which he has secured in studying the operations in boxing hose by motion time analysis and then putting into  | effect new methods which resulted after unnecessary motions were eliminated . The standard time based on stop watch time studies for labeling , handling and boxing was 0.22 minutes per pair of hose . The standard time by the new method which was established by motion time analysis and which covered the same work was 0.096 minutes per pair of hose . That is , the final ratio of time reduction was 44% . The wage rate of the girls was increased , the old standard having been 40 cents per hour and the new standard 51 cents per hour . The estimated savings per year due to this change of method is $4,500 . The cost of the motion time analysis work was $2,200 . Referring to another job Brinkman says that the speed of training is quite rapid . Within ten days operators were brought down to standard cycle time which was an improvement of 60% over the time established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cost there were other advantages , the principal being : ( 1 ) processing time per batch of hosiery is substantially reduced ; ( 2 ) quality control of production and workmanship is more definitely established ; ( 3 ) training period for new operators is radically reduced .  | LAWS OF WAGE PAYMENT Wages , their amount in relation to what is produced and the methods whereby they are computed and paid , have had a long and persistent study in the development and application of management to manufacturing . As regards wage payment plans , some seventeen are recognized.58 The laws of wage payment given here concern the bases from which wages are set , and methods that govern the application of monetary incentive and the basis of hours of work . In presenting them it is clearly recognized that there are incentives other than money which have been effectually used by many managers . Incentives of this kind are often referred to as " nonfinancial rewards . " They recognize and build upon the joy of craftsmanship , of producing quality on the one hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first is emotional , the second intellectual satisfaction . There are numerous successful installations where the stimulation to more and better output is nonfinancial , and from the experiences in these cases we know that such incentives are powerful . Influence of Leadership However , little progress has been made in formulating the fundamentals underlying work of this kind . In " Management 's Handbook , p. 909.  | fact , there seems to be no group of principles in this connection which are of sufficient certainty and validity to warrant inclusion here . A reason for this situation may lie in the fact that wherever non-financial incentives are found in use there is also found a strong manager , a leader of men . It seems possible , therefore , that the successful use of non-financial incentives or rewards is an attribute of leadership , and that such methods can not stand alone but must always have the force and personality of a manager behind them . WAGES Two laws of wages written from the manufacturer 's viewpoint are : 1 . Law of Relative Wages : Wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand ; wages tend to rise when the supply of labor is insufficient to satisfy the demand . 2 . Law of Wage Level : The normal wage level of each country depends upon and corresponds to that country 's general average productivity of labor . COROLLARY : High wages accompany high production . Jacob D. Cox , president , Cleveland Twist Drill Company , explains the first law in this way : " If there are many men capable of doing a given class of work and not much demand for their services , then wages or salaries for that work will be comparatively low . But if there are very few men who can  | perform the work competently , and a great deal depends on its being done well , then the salaries paid will be proportionately high . " In a free country like the United States this is practically the only consideration influencing relative wages ( that is , the wages or salary of one individual in relation to that of others ) . " In regard to the second law , Cox states that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our average per capita production is very high and we consequently are able to pay these high wages and still sell our products in competition with the products from other countries . The only way to secure them ( high wages ) is , first , to raise the average productivity of labor through better cooperation between workers and employers , and through better industrial organization , and then allow the higher wages to come of themselves . " F. W. Taussig supports this point of view , saying that the rise in general wages for the last century and a half has had its basis in steadily growing productiveness . " Since the middle of the 19th century there has been a rise in general wages ( commodity wages ) in all the countries of advanced civilization . The basis of that rise has been the steadily growing productiveness of labor , due to the manifold advances in the arts . " ss Rise of Wages Irreversible These laws might be classed as economic rather than managerial , because they express trends rather than relationships between facts and conditions over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends footnote 6D Principles of Economics , Vol. 2 , p. 220.  | have been shown in Chapter III to be irreversible if they arise from an evolutionary change . The second law is distinctly of this order , as will be shown a little further on . As given here these laws of wages have been formulated by a manufacturer of large interests whose company is the most successful in its line in the United States and one that has an enviable record in its employer-employee relations . It is essential to understand , when considering any wage situation or when formulating a wage policy , that wages have steadily increased since the time when men ceased to be slaves and became free men , and that the level of wages at any time depends upon the productivity of labor at that time . As recently as the years of the World War and down to the business slump of 1921 , many manufacturers and most labor leaders believed that wages had a direct relationship to the cost of living . Many methods were devised and applied to satisfy what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While in any labor situation there may be local factors such as union activities , strikes , labor scouting , unfavorable living conditions or rapidly developing nearby communities which a manager will find perplexing , still in the long run no manager can go counter to the regulative force of these laws and continue to operate successfully . How Wages Have Risen To show how wages have steadily risen over a long period we must turn to English experience . Fortunately , facts are available . William Hardy has corn-  | piled a record of the wages of laborers for a nearly 700-year period from 1250 to 1920 . The rates are from " undeniable facts derived from original records covering a period of over 700 years in the history of the building trade in London . " He finds that , with the exception of very short periods , wages have never decreased . Such a slight decrease occurred between 1292 and 1324 following the completion of Westminster Abbey , Westminster Palace and the extensive alterations at the Tower of London . He gives the day wages of laborers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of 2 cents for each penny : He concludes his article as follows : " The lesson taught by these investigations is undoubtedly that wages , when they have once risen , never fall . Is it not time , therefore , that we adjust our accounts to the new standard ? It is false optimism to believe that the near future will show us a return to old conditions . History shows that only by stabilizing the controlling factorwages ? is it possible to fix the price of commodities . When any increase has been sanctioned it must be realized that such increase has brought us to another rung in the ladder of wages , of which the lower rungs have been forever destroyed . " The slowness yet steadiness of the rise as indicated  | by this record is better shown by the curve on the chart of Figure 12 . The sudden up-turn has come after 1900 . Rise in American Wages Simeon North , who has been presented in Chapter IV as a leader in American manufacturing , in 1808 paid Rise of Common Laborer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month " to blow and strike awelding pistols " and " Selah Goodrich came to work for three months at $6 per month and three months after at $8 per month . " These wages are at the rate of 24 to 48 cents per day or somewhat lower than the wages of laborers in London at the same period . The wages of women who worked in the mills at even a somewhat later date were lower still . " About the  | same time ( 1837 ) it was shown that there were more than 15,000 women in the shoe industry of Massachusetts , hundreds of them earning only from 8 to 10 cents a day up to 40 to 50 cents . " 60 George Westinghouse whose experience as a manufacturer is also presented in Chapter IV went to work in his father 's shop in May , 1860 , for 50 cents per day . The following March he was earning 75 cents per day ; in April , 1862 , he was raised to 871/2 cents . In February , 1863 , he was advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April of that year he was raised to $1.121/2 . Present Day Wages Present wages for the kinds of work done in Simeon North 's and G. Westinghouse and Company 's shops are given in an accompanying table . The rates are for the year 1925. figure  | Wages of women cotton-mill workers have had a similar rise . The rates given below are representative of those received in 1926. figure The sweep of experience shows that wages have steadily risen for centuries and there is no reason whatever to expect a change in this trend . TASK AND WAGE INCENTIVE The laws which govern the relationships of the task or stint and wage incentive are : 1 . The average worker accomplishes the most when assigned a definite amount of work to be done in a given time . ( Taylor ) 2 . A wage incentive for the accomplishment of a definite task influences a workman to maintain his maximum output .  | 3 . Incentive wage rates must be based on such simple mathematical rules that the worker will have no difficulty in determining unaided the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Frederick W. Taylor sl stated the first law as : " There is no question that the average individual accomplishes the most when he either gives himself , or someone else assigns him , a definite task , namely , a given amount of work which he must do within a given time ; and the more elementary the mind and character of the individual the more necessary does it become that each task shall extend over a short period only . " " Perhaps the most important law belonging to this class ( those that influence workers ) in its relation to scientific management , is the effect which the task idea has upon the efficiency of the workman . This , in fact , has become such an important element of the mechanism of scientific management that by a great number of people , scientific management has come to be known as task management . ' " Taylor 63 also gave factors for the amount of the wage incentive : " To get maximum output for ordinary shop work requiring neither especial brains , very close application , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , as the more ordinary kinds of routine machine-shop work , it is necessary to pay about 30% more than the average . For footnote ' . Shop Management , p. 69 . " ' Principles of Scientific Management , p. 68 . " Shop Management , p. 26.  | ordinary day labor requiring little brains or special skill , but calling for strength , severe bodily exertion , and fatigue , it is necessary to pay from 50% to 60% above the average . For work requiring especial skill or brains , coupled with close application , but without severe bodily exertion , such as the more difficult and delicate machinist 's work , from 70% to 80% beyond the average . And for work requiring skill , brains , close application , strength , and severe bodily exertion , such for instance , as that involved in operating a well-run steam hammer doing miscellaneous work , from 80% to 100% beyond the average . " Possibilities of Wage Incentives As to the results that may be secured from an incentive wage system based on standard times , Frederic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with day work . For unskilled workers the production ratio should be approximately 2:1 . For machine operators the production ratio should be approximately 2.6:1 . For all-round mechanics the production ratio should be approximately 3.33:1 . For highly skilled men the production ratio should be approximately 3.75:1 . For a plant as a whole where both direct and indirect labor are working under adequate standards and incentives the ratio should be from 2:1 to 2.25:1 . For direct labor only the average ratio for a plant as a whole should be approximately 2.5:1.  | Mr. Parkhurst shows that piece work and premium work will secure on the average only about 70% of the production indicated above as obtainable from standard times and incentives . He says further that some figure 90% of the workers in any manufacturing organization can be placed on a standard time basis and calls attention to these two important facts : " Properly applied and managed methods combined with differential bonus pay will permanently maintain  | average job efficiencies of 92 to 96% for a total grand average . " Employees though long employed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will immediately drop back to the usual low day-work efficiencies when for any reason they are without bonus work to do . " " Results of Wage Incentives Many examples are available as to the improvement made by installing a system of wage incentive . Only a few need be presented here to show the results of applying the laws . Improvements in Operation L. A. Sylvester while industrial engineer for the Atlantic Refining Company increased the labor efficiency of wharf gangs made up of colored laborers 90% by installing a system of group bonus . The results secured at various stages are shown on the chart of Figure 13 . The average hourly earnings for the four stages were :  | E. S. McQueen , general manager , Hoosier Manufacturing Company , credits a combined waste and production bonus plan with increases in production up to 30% for various departments , and with improvement in material efficiencies up to 21% . The rates of bonus paid ranged up to 19% . Theodore Clark , industrial engineer , Eastern Manufacturing Company , has applied incentives to the work of plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reduced 54% and earnings of the workers increased 43% . As indicating the extent to which wage payment plans are applied within an organization W. S. Hosford , vice president , The Western Electric Company , has this to say : Upward of 24,000 workers are employed in the manufacturing departments of the Hawthorne and Kearny works of his company . Of this number 85% of the direct workers are on piece rate and 23% of the indirect workers . Several incentive plans are used , the principal one being gang piece rate , for 60% of the direct workers who are working under an incentive plan are operating under what is usually referred to as group wage incentive . BASE TIME Base time on standardized jobs should never be changed except in those cases where a substantial change has previously been made in conditions , methods , or equipment . The National Metal Trades Association in a recently issued booklet on " Methods of Wage Payment " gives a  | group of general principles . The one which supports the above law reads : " Rates or standards should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate studies , and should be subject to such checks and rechecks before definite adoption as to make unnecessary any later change in the rate or standard as long as the job itself remains unchanged . " Good Faith in Wage Payment The law of base time is a law of good faith between employer and employee . Once accurate job standardization has been done and time and piece rates set therefrom these rates can not be changed without a previous change in working conditions , operations , tools , machinery , materials , or equipment . Otherwise the morale , the influence of incentives , and good industrial relations are destroyed . Many concerns give to their employees a guaranty that base times will not be changed except for changes in operation as stated in the law . The Gilbert and Barker Manufacturing Company prints the following guaranty on every bonus chart issued : " The following prices will be paid as bonus in addition to and entirely independent of hourly wages based on good pieces which pass inspection , after this specific operation , except that defective work not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deducted in paying bonus . These Bonus Prices and Standard Times will not be lowered no matter how long the job may run with this equipment and by the method and design specified in the instruction referred to . " The practical question in applying this law is how  | much change in method or design and what improvement in tools and equipment justifies a change in a guaranteed rate . L. A. Sylvester has answered this question by offering this rule : " Any change in condition which permanently increases or decreases efficiency over 15 points from the 100% mark warrants a change in incentive rate . " HOURS OF WORK The law of hours of work formulated by Jacob D. Cox and his explanation follow : All other factors influencing production being constant , a decrease in. the hours of work increase 's the leisure of the workers , an increase in the hours of work increases the comfort of the workers . ( Cox ) " The hours to be worked are always a compromise between greater leisure and greater comfort for the workers . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working hours should be shortened or lengthened depends on whether increased leisure , or an increased consumption of the good things of life , is most desirable in the opinion of the general average . " The Course of Hours of Work As for wage levels , we must turn to the study of a long period to gain a knowledge of the trend of hours of work . Here again English records supply convincing information . In the sixteenth century a laborer was required by statute to work from sunrise to sunset . In  | the fifth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth ( 1562 ) the " statute of labourers " was passed . This was so securely based on custom that it remained in force down to the time of the industrial revolution and the rise of the factory system . The following paragraph is from the statute : " All artificers and labourers being hired by the day or week shall , betwixt the midst of the months of March and September , be and continue at their work and not depart until betwixt 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of breakfast , dinner or drinking , the which time at the most shall not exceed two hours and a half in a day , that is to say , at every drinking half an hour , for his dinner one hour , and for his sleep , when he is allowed to sleep , the which is from the midst of May to the midst of August , half an hour ; and all the said artificers and labourers betwixt the midst of September and the midst of March shall be and continue at their work from the spring of the day in the morning until the night of the same day , except it be in time afore appointed for breakfast and dinner , upon pain to lose and forfeit one penny for every hour 's absence , to be deducted and defaulted out of his wages who shall so offend . " Factory Hours a Century Ago The hours of labor during the early years of the factory system were little better . In 1832 a Parliamentary committee investigated British factory conditions and on the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This man , who had girls working in the mills , gave this testimony :  | QUESTION : At what time in the morning , in the brisk time , did those girls go to the mills ? ANSWER : In the brisk time , for about six weeks , they have gone at three o'clock in the morning and ended at ten , or nearly half past , at night . QUESTION : Had you not great difficulty in awakening your children to this excessive labour ? ANSWER : Yes , in the early time we had to take them up asleep and shake them , when we got them on the floor , to dress them , before we could get them off to their work ; but not so in the common hours . QUESTION : What was the length of time they could be in bed during those hours ? ANSWER : It was near eleven o'clock before we could get them into bed after getting a little victuals , and then at morning my missus used to stop up all night , for fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUESTION : Were the children excessively fatigued by this labour ? ANSWER : Many times ; we have cried often when we have given them the little victualling we had to give them ; we had to shake them , and they have fallen to sleep with the victuals in their mouths many a time . Shortening of Hours in America In the early days of American manufacturing working hours of fourteen and sixteen per day were common . The process of shortening has been going on steadily until the usual working week is now from forty-five to fifty hours with some plants working as few as forty . The five-day week has been adopted in certain cases , notably in the Ford industries . Summer vacations with pay also have the effect of shortening the number of  | hours worked per year . While working hours have been shortening productivity has been increasing and costs have been lowering , as shown in Chapter I. The chart of Figure 14 shows graphically the change which has taken place in hours of working . It will be noticed that the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come after 1900 . Outstanding Cases In 1923 the issue of shorter hours in the iron and steel industry became a matter of public interest . President Harding appealed to Judge Elbert H. Gary , at that time President of the Iron and Steel Institute , to take steps to do away with the twelve-hour shift in that great industry . This appeal was supported by a report on " The Twelve Hour Shift in Industry " issued by the American Engineering Council at the end of 1922 . The result is known to everyone for acceding to the request  | of President Harding and under the pressure of public opinion the iron and steel industry began to do away with the long turn and seven-day week . The investigation into conditions in that industry was made for the American Engineering Council by Bradley Stoughton . Now , five years later , in a letter to the author he reviews the effect of the change , showing that under the shorter working hours production has increased with little if any increase in unit labor costs : " I think we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight-hour day , and probably neither of them would want to return to the twelve-hour day . It is a fact that many of both classes believe that the twelve-hour day is too long and the eight-hour day too short for the best results financially and industrially . Where it has been possible to adopt a ten-hour day , this has been done and it has worked out very well in certain classes of employment where there could be two turns of ten hours with two idle periods between , or where certain general gangs would be on ten-hour periods , not necessarily dividing the day into three eight-hour periods . " One prominent employer says that production has increased approximately thirty per cent ( 30% ) with practically ten per cent ( 10% ) less men ; but this is not all due to the eight-hour day , but also to improved methods and machinery . The men do appear , however , to be more satisfied and more efficient , and the labor turnover is less . The operations are better from a safety standpoint , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , the predictions made in the report , published under the auspices of the Ameri-  | can Engineering Council , entitled The Twelve-Hour Day in Industry ' seemed to have been more than justified . Some employers definitely say that they believe labor costs have not increased much , if any , from the old twelve-hour day . "  | LAWS OF SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE Safety of the Worker Maintenance of Machinery and Equipment CHAPTER XI LAWS OF SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE Accident prevention and industrial safety are commonly thought of as applying to the individual , the worker . The safety first movement has been aimed at reducing accidents to human beings . A moment 's consideration will show , however , that accidents , unusual happenings , may occur and do occur when there is no loss of life nor personal injury . But there may be and often is danger to property or equipment ; there may be and often is interruption to the flow of work with an accompanying loss of production . S. J. Williams , when engineer of the National Safety Council , instructively developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose a box falls off a loaded truck and kills a man . For every such case which results in a physical injury there will be perhaps a hundred cases where a box falls off , without injuring anyone . But in every one of these hundred cases either the box will be broken or in any case the truck will have to be stopped and the load repiled . While , therefore , there will be only one case of physical injury , there will be a hundred and one cases of inefficiency . An accident is something gone wrong and it can result only from causes which have their effect over a far wider field than that of the immediate accident itself . The physical injury is only the spectacular evidence of some underlying maladjustment  | in the same way that a headache is only an alarm bell that calls attention to something wrong within . " s4 Safety of Men and Things Safety and the prevention of accidents must , therefore , be considered and administered from the viewpoint of the whole as concerning all human beings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the productivity of man , tool , or machine are to be guarded against , prevented , if possible , and in every instance brought down to the irreducible minimum . The managerial attack on this element of manufacturing operation has been made through safety methods as regards the workers and through organized maintenance as regards the equipment . The direct connection between productivity and good-order tools and machines has been long recognized ; but proof of the same relationship between the safety of the workers and production is quite recent . SAFETY The application of this concept to the human being , the worker , or the law of safety is : Maximum productivity is dependent upon the reduction of accidents to an irreducible minimum . ( American Engineering Council ) The above statement of the law of safety in manufacturing is from the report of a special research committee of the American Engineering Council . Fourteen footnote " From an address delivered at the Engineers ' Club , New York , November 7 , 1919.  | months were spent in studying the relationship of safety and production in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the law is stated reads : " . . . There is a close relationship between safety and production ? a relationship so pronounced and consistent throughout as to indicate a fundamental of management , which may be stated as follows : Maximum productivity is dependent upon the reduction of accidents to an irreducible minimum . " 65 Possibilities of Accident Prevention Few , if any , of the laws of management in manufacturing have such a possibility of a high percentage of application as this law of safety . H. W. Heinrich , assistant superintendent , Engineering and Inspection Division , The Travelers ' Insurance Company , has this to say both in regard to the percentage of accidents which are preventable and to the possible money saving : " The conditions under which 98% of all industrial accidents are preventable are not impracticable of attainment nor are they expensive or complicated ; yet it is too much to expect that the fundamentals will be immediately and universally grasped . Making due allowance for existing difficulties we nevertheless are convinced that the recognition of the principles herein involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2. 88% of the causes of all accidents are supervisory and 10% are physical ( both within the power of the employer and employee to remedy ) , footnote ? 6 Safety and Production , pp. 69 , 70.  | 3 . Basic causes must be the guide to preventive action , 4 . All accidents ( including minor cases ) should be recorded and analyzed , will , within a period of a few years , make possible a reduction of 50% in the industrial-accident frequency of the country . This incidentally will result in a saving of at least $5,000,000,000 annually in accident costs which at present are borne by the employer and incidentally by the public which ultimately must absorb all industrial economic loss . " Safety and Production Turning again to the report on safety and production the mass analysis of accident and production records from 7,920 companies employing 932,952 workers gives a coefficient of correlation of .835 . Perfect correlation , that is , causation , is represented by the coefficient 1 . Therefore , the degree of correlation discovered in the investigation is impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety drive has been carried on in the cement industry initiated by the Portland Cement Association . A few of the results are given by A. J. R. Curtis , assistant to the general manager of the association . He tells of an eastern manufacturer who , during the period May 1 , 1921 to October 31 , 1927 , had a total payroll of $3,000,000 . The cost of workmen 's compensation insurance during this period based on the rates in Lost-time Accidents in the Portland Cement Industry Were Cut to One-quarter of Corresponding Month in Previous Year  | force in May , 1921 would have been $105,475.94 . The actual cost of insurance plus the cost of safety work done in the plant was $41,155.16 . This shows a saving for a period of some six and a half years of $64,320.78 . While these figures are impressive for a single plant , those for the entire industry are no less significant . The table on page 209 shows the effect of the eight years ' safety drive . A special effort was made to improve the accident record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onefourth as many accidents occurred that month as in the corresponding month for 1926 . Figure 15 is a graphical comparison . No Lost-Time Accidents The positive minimum of accidents is , of course , no accidents . There are numerous cases of long-time operation without an accident causing a loss of working time exceeding the day , shift or turn in which the accident occurred . L. A. DeBlois , a member of the research committee that made the investigation into safety and production for the American Engineering Council , has brought together a number of conspicuous no-accident records . These show the possibilities of minimum accident operation . The following tables , the first for eleven works of the United Steel Corporation , and the second for fourteen divisions of the E. I. DuPont De Nemours Company , show such records up to and exceeding 400,000 man-days.  | MAINTENANCE The law of accident prevention as applied to plant and equipment , or the law of maintenance is : Anticipating repairs and replacements prevents interruption due to bad order or broken down equipment . Frederick A. Waldron has expressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to anticipate and prevent , to greatest possible extent , interruption in operation , loss of output due to bad order or broken down machinery and equipment in a manufacturing concern . " The folk maxim , " A stitch in time saves nine , " has the same thought . Results from the application of this law expressed in percentage of improvement or in money savings are not available . However , organized maintenance is carried on in concerns operating under progressive management with full belief in its economic advantages .  | LAWS OF ECONOMY A beginning has been made to express the relationships of the factors that yield certain maximum results or economies in the form of mathematical equations . Without doubt this process will continue until such of the laws of manufacturing management as can be written into formulas will have been so formulated . In this chapter four such laws are given each having been developed through the assistance and encouragement of a leading American engineering organization . The American Society of Mechanical Engineers was the body which developed the first three , the work having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the fourth the American Engineering Standards Committee has been the initiating agency . Contrast with Academic Economics No part of the development of the fundamentals of management is in sharper contrast with the academic work done in the economic and social sciences than that presented by this particular group of mathematically expressed laws . Here relationships are not vaguely given in words without quantitative values but they are presented in exact positions through the symbols and language of mathematics . Work of this kind in time may lead to a new economics written or largely influenced by engineers and starting with the known facts  | of production instead of the theories of trade and distribution . ECONOMIC MANUFACTURING LOT SIZES ( A. S. M. E. ) Work has been under way for several years to discover a formula to give the most economic sizes of lot to manufacture under a given set of operating conditions . Notable contributions to this study have been made by George D. Babcock , manufacturing engineer , Dodge Brothers ; by Professor Ralph C. Davis , General Motors Institute of Technology ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Van Dorn Iron Works . At the request of the Executive Committee of the Management Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers , Fairfield E. Raymond , works manager , Crosby Steam Gage and Valve Company , undertook to compare and combine the previous studies . The following formula and illustrative example are taken from his work.68 Economic Lot Formula The economic lot size formulas are derived by differentiating the total unit cost U with regard to Q and equating the result to zero , as Q must be that quantity which is produced at minimum unit cost . The formula for unit cost is figure footnote " For complete analysis of the factors in the equation the reader is referred to Mr. Raymond 's paper " Economic Production Quantities , " published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers .  | where U = Total unit cost ( dollars ) c ' = Direct unit production cost of materials , labor and overhead ( simple manufacturing cost ) ( dollars ) F = Total fixed or preparation costs ( dollars ) Q = Economic production quantity ( pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Iv , = Total investment charge on work-in-process ( dollars ) V = Total rental charge on the storage space ( dollars ) D = Loss involved by deterioration of articles in stock , total ( dollars ) The exact solution requires that the cost of the finished article held in stock when applied to expressions , la , and D , be the total unit cost U ; whereas the approximate solution assumes that the cost of the finished article is only the manufactured cost ( c ' + F/Q ) . The time and labor saved in applying the shorter form for Q far outweighs the slight increase in accuracy obtained from the exact formula . The error is negligible except when Q is very small , since the natural error in estimating an average demand figure Y will wholly counteract the discrepancy . The formula for common use is , therefore : figure The terms used in this equation are defined either above or as follows , and values for these terms are derived further on in the discussion :  | P = Daily rate of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand over turnover period ( pieces ) i = Interest rate expressed in terms of days ( per cent ) k = Stock coefficient , equal to % if demand is uniform n = Number of batches kP = Ratio c " /c ' c " = Average unit value for each batch ( dollars ) a ' = Time factor for batch production v = Unit charge per day per cu . ft. of space occupied ( dollars ) B = Storage space occupied by each unit ( cu . ft . ) Simplification of the Formula Although the formula looks complicated , considerable simplification can be made when applied to a given type of industry . The various items may be divided into groups several of which are general in their application and will reduce the formula to one having but a few special items . All terms may be arranged in four groups according to the influence of 1 . Production or consumption rates 2 . General economic values 3 . The specific process 4 . The individual part In applying the law of the economic production quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four types depending upon the nature of the processes involved . 1 . Industries having continuous production and which can arrange groups of machinery or processes , eliminating set-up costs and reducing supervision and  | maintenance costs to a minimum . Production follows sales demand but is uninterrupted . 2 . Industries with a varied line of products and diversified sales demand . Production is at a semi-continuous rate , the equipment being shifted to another line of products when stock on the first has been built up . 3 . Industries which can not take advantage of continuous production and are unable to withdraw material from work-in-process to meet sales until the whole number of articles being processed is entirely completed . 4 . Industries constituting job shops where all articles are produced in unrelated quantities at irregular intervals and are probably never produced again . Preparation and supervision costs are a large proportion of total unit cost and no stock is kept in stores . Other formulas are used in connection with the building up of the main formula . Manufacturing cost : figure where c ' is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 the unit cost of labor , and o the unit overhead on operating time ( all in dollars ) . The second formula is used if labor and overhead are reduced to terms of the sum of all the production time per piece h , the hourly labor rates dl and the burden rates do of each department involved . Preparation cost F is a fixed charge against the whole order and is written as follows : figure  | where D is cost of writing specifications and doing drawing room work , G the cost of planning and scheduling , 0 the cost of issuing the order , T tool preparation including special tools , and S machine set-up ( all in dollars for the entire job ) . Length of sales period is expressed : where T , is duration of sales period in days , Ya is average demand in pieces per day , and Q is as above defined . Production time is determined by : figure where Q is the economic lot size and P is production rate . Interest rate i charged against capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn when devoted to production . This would be as much as 20% or 25% per year , which should then be reduced to terms of days . figure where Sx = Maximum quantity that will be held in stock at the end of the manufacturing period ( number of pieces ) B = Space occupied by each unit ( cu . ft. ) v = Factor representing the unit charge per day per cu . ft. of space occupied ( dollars per cu . ft . ) T = Period during which such articles are held in stock ( days )  | Average amount of capital devoted to work-in-process throughout the manufacturing period is determined as follows : figure where c " = average unit value of each batch at any instant ( dollars ) ; m , 1 and o are respectively the cost of material , labor and overhead for the batch ( dollars ) ; ka = average value factor ; and the second formula is used if labor and overhead are reduced to terms of the sum of all the production time per piece h , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a of each department involved . The number of pieces in a batch is Q/n , where n is the number of batches and the cost per batch at any instant is c " Q/n . However , in order to determine the total investment charge all batches are completed in time Tp , and therefore the degree of completion factor is unity and the average value factor ka =1/2 . The cost per batch can thereby be expressed as figure the cost of the entire lot of n batches , or the capital involved in work-in-process , figure where k = c " /c ' . The time over which the investment charge applies is equal to the production time for each batch , including all operations , and will be designated by t ' . The time required to complete the first operation ( ti ) is that which separates the start of each batch .  | figure  | figure An Approximate Formula The preceding example shows that considerable computation is necessary to apply the Raymond formula . Appreciating this fact , Paul N. Lehoczky has developed a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and quickly solved . The results though not identical with the more exact formula are undoubtedly close enough for many situations and particularly in relatively small shops .  | The factors and their symbols are these : Let X = The number of lots to be produced per year M = The interest on raw material if purchased once a year L = Set-up charge J ? Output Capacity S ? Cost of finished product Cost of raw material Using these symbols Mr. Lehoczky 's formula is figure X = Example Using Approximate Formula Using the quantities given inthe example under the Raymond formula , Mr. Lehoczky has worked out the following solution : figure Comparing results of the two formulas Raymond gives an answer of 122 days ' production as the time of economic production . The approximate formula gives as the answer 127 days . Without doubt , in any shop either answer would be scheduled as four months and production planned accordingly .  | ECONOMIC PURCHASE QUANTITIES ( DAVIS ) Professor It . C. Davis worked out a general formula for the minimum cost quantity to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a paper given at a national meeting of the Management Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers . From that source the following has been compiled : In placing an order the purchasing agent must consider not only price but in addition quality , delivery and quantity . Every experienced purchase executive knows that a cheap price may prove most expensive if the quality of the material makes it difficult to process or depreciates the ultimate quality of the product ; if the material is not delivered promptly , causing expensive hold-ups of the production program ; if the quantity purchased is so great that interest , storage , depreciation and obsolescence charges unduly increase unit costs ; if the quantity purchased is so small that the unit cost of procurement is disproportionate , or so large that interest and storage charges increase unit costs unduly . In the better managed plants , accurate information regarding prices and price trends is being obtained regularly from records of previous quotations , reporting services , trade journals , manufacturers ' associations , governmental and semi-governmental sources , daily papers , graphical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . This information is studied carefully and constantly . The quality of purchased materials is being insured through the use of properly prepared specifications in making the purchase  | contract and in inspecting the goods when delivered . To insure deliveries as promised , vendor 's records , showing capacity and past performance of each vendor from whom the company has had occasion to buy goods , are studied before the order is placed . These and other precautions may be taken to insure that the company gets the right quality , delivery and price . However , the determination of how much to buy may not receive the same careful treatment . Ideal Condition The ideal condition would be an assured delivery of the exact quantity of material necessary to meet the needs of the plant , at the exact time that the old stock is exhausted , making it unnecessary to carry reserve stocks . Of course , such an ideal is unattainable in actual practice , although some concerns have approximated it to a surprising degree . Obviously , the trend in inventory practice is to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this trend is becoming more pronounced as the practice of advance ordering is being given up in favor of buying against current needs . As the quantity purchased at any one time increases , the unit cost of procurement decreases , but the unit interest and storage charges increase . The total unit cost of the item decreases up to the point where increasing unit interest and storage charges outweigh decreasing unit procurement charges . Beyond this point , the total unit cost increases . Obviously , the maximum ordering quantity should be such that it will hold the total unit cost at this turning point .  | The Formula The equation for determining the minimum-cost purchase quantity is , figure where Q = The quantity to be purchased to bring the total unit cost to a minimum G = The total procurement cost in dollars K = The interest factor H = The storage factor It is evident that the value of G must be determined by investigation , but once determined it is a standard value which will not change until there are changes in methods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall factors made up of several elements or detail factors . These are as follows : figure where C " = The unit purchase price in dollars I = The current rate of interest in per cent S = The rate of consumption expressed in pieces per B = The bulk factor , expressed in square feet of net storage space required per unit of item . Storage space is valuable . Against it can be resolved many charges such as light , heat , taxes , insurance , wages and salaries . The greater the quantity purchased , the greater the charge , offsetting somewhat any savings from quantity buying . The term " net floor space "  | means net usable floor space , exclusive of aisles , steel bin frames , etc . E = The storage charge , expressed in dollars per square foot of net storage space per year . It is based on the expense of such items as were mentioned in connection with B. The factor S is explained above . As to the values of these factors in a given case : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I is current financial information ; S is derived either directly or indirectly from the production program ; B is determined by investigation and E by calculation , and both become standard values for a given item until there are considerable changes in the factors affecting them . An Illustrative Example The following example will show applications of the equation . It has been determined from the production program that approximately 10,000 pieces of a certain material will be required during the coming six months ' period . The market price is $0.10 per piece . The outlook is for a stable market . The procurement time is approximately four weeks . The expense of procurement for this class of material is estimated at $10 per order . The material is stored in standard bins , 2 feet square , having a cubical content of 8 cubic feet . There are four tiers in a bin stack . Approximately 100 pieces can be stowed in a bin . Normally a 5% reserve stock is carried for this item . The cost of net storage space is estimated at $4 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 6 % .  | The numerical values of the several factors in the equation become : figure One more factor needs to be determined , the minimum order point . This is found by dividing the total yearly needs in the same number of parts as there are procurement periods in a year . The total yearly needs are 20,000 X 1.05 = 21,000 pieces The procurement period is 4 weeks , or 52 of a year 21,000 X 52 = 1,632 pieces  | To sum up the example , it would be advisable to purchase on the market in lots of 2,200 pieces . The balance-of-stores department would originate a purchase requisition when the available supply fell to 1,650 pieces . Under this arrangement , each lot would cover approximately 51/2 weeks ' requirements . Before placing an order for a particular lot , actual consumption could be checked against the original consumption estimates , based on the production program . ECONOMY OF LABOR-SAVING EQUIPMENT ( A. S. M. E. ) 69 The laws of economy of labor-saving equipment may be expressed as follows : figure These formulas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1925 . They provide means for economic analysis of manufacturing to show the savings that have accrued or may be secured from improved mechanical equipment . The factors involved are : Formulas for Computing the Economies of Labor-Saving Equipment , by James A. Shepard and George E. Hagemann.  | DEBIT FACTORS : A = Percentage allowance on investment B. = Percentage allowance to provide for insurance , taxes , etc . C = Percentage allowance to provide for upkeep = Percentage allowance to provide for depreciation and H obsolescence E = Yearly cost of power , supplies , and other items which are consumed , in dollars CREDIT FACTORS : S = Yearly saving in direct cost of labor , in dollars Ta = Yearly saving in labor burden , in dollars Tb = Yearly fixed charges , on mechanical equipment employed as a standard of comparison or which will be displaced , in dollars U = Yearly saving or earning through increased production , in dollars OTHER FACTORS : X = Percentage of year during which equipment will be operated I = Initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of equipment displaced , less its resale or scrap value , in dollars RESULTS : Z = Maximum investment which will earn simple interest , in dollars Y = Yearly cost to maintain mechanical equipment ready for operation ( fixed charges ) , in dollars V = Yearly profit , in excess of fixed charges , from operation of mechanical equipment , in dollars P = Yearly profit from operation , in per cent on investment , including fixed charges H = Years required for complete amortization of investment out of earnings .  | An Illustrative Example An instructive example showing the application of this formula is afforded by data supplied by T. J. Reilly , superintendent of material , The Durant Motors Company . George E. Hagemann made the analysis and computed the results . It applies to the installation of five Clark truclifts . Mr. Reilly gives these facts in regard to operation of this material handling equipment : " Various parts such as springs , frames , tire carrying brackets , etc. , have to be taken from freight cars and conveyed either to the storerooms or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truclifts ) is to pile these pieces on low platforms placed alongside the freight cars ( or inside as soon as the car is partly empty ) . The platforms of the Clark truclifts are then run under these loaded platforms and lift the latter from the ground and take them to their destinations . Here the truclifts lower the platforms again and leave them on the floor . " Formerly the material was taken from the cars and carried over to a wooden belt conveyor from which it was removed by men at the other end and piled up . This method meant handling a piece by hand three times , whereas now it is handled but once . " The truclifts are also used for hauling many miscellaneous items such as batteries , lamps and windshields in crates . The loads vary a great deal in weight , as much as 4,000 lbs . being hauled at once by one truclift . In a few instances they have been employed to spot freight cars on the railroad tracks which run beside the receiving platforms . They have also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors of freight cars . They operate nine hours per day . " The hauling distances vary over a wide range . Some of the hauls are half a mile long . In several places the trucks have to climb steep grades , one of them being about 25% . There are three floors in the building and the Clark machines are taken from one floor to another by means of elevators . They are employed both inside and outside , in all parts of the plant except the paint shop . " The saving in labor effected by these truclifts varies according to the type of work being done and over a wide range . It is very conservative to set the labor saving at an average of three men per working day ( for each truck ) . " Calculations from the Survey Data The calculations made from the survey of this equipment in actual use are given in the following tabulation and cover the cost of operating the truclifts : figure The economic analysis by formula based upon the preceding figures and calculations follows . The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposed installation but a measure of the efficiency of equipment upon which actual service figures have been obtained . " figure The final calculations yielding the yearly profit from operation in per cent on investment and the years required for amortization of investment out of earnings follow : figure ECONOMY OF SERIES The possibilities of securing economies by adopting carefully planned series for proportions , ratings , scales and the like have been presented to and discussed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers on several occasions . As a result of the interest so aroused and of numerous requests for a scientific basis for such series the American Engineering Standards Committee appointed a special committee to study the whole matter . This body was designated the General Committee on Preferred Numbers . From its membership a working committee of eight was formed under the chairmanship of the author . The report of that committee was adopted by the General Committee in April , 1927 and informally approved by the main committee of the American Engineering Standards Committee in June , 1927 . It is , therefore , recommended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law as applied to manufacturing is : In manufacturing the series of greatest economy is the one that will satisfy the conditions with the fewest terms .  | In practice the geometric series is the most economical for it contains the fewest number of terms that will satisfy the conditions . Of course , the economy of fewest items is axiomatic in manufacturing . In management work Carl G. Barth has used geometric progression in standardizing the feeds and speeds of machine tools and for establishing wage scales . Preferred Numbers A convenient means whereby geometric series can be constructed for a given purpose is offered by the series of preferred numbers recommended by the American Engineering Standards Committee . They are given in full in the accompanying table . The explanatory statement follows : figure  | sions than lengths , the numbers apply to the unit forming the basis of the standardization . " Preferred Numbers above 10 inches are formed by multiplying the numbers between 1 and 10 in. by 10 , 100 , etc . Preferred Numbers below .001 in. are formed correspondingly by division of the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . Between .001 and .01 in. the 20 series will probably serve as the finest gradation ; the 40 series is , therefore , not given . " So far as possible the numbers of the 5 series are to be used in preference to those of the 10 series , these again in preference to those of the 20 series , and these finally to those of the 40 series . It is permissible to pass over from one series of Preferred Numbers to an adjacent series . " An Illustration Mention has been made that Barth has used preferred number series in establishing wage scales . As early as 1904 he applied the principles of geometric series upon which preferred numbers systems are based to machine hour rates and somewhat later to day rates . He has made such applications in some half-dozen plants and the scales so computed seem to be fair both to employer and employee . The principle is that the greater a man 's wages the greater should be the increase which he might receive from time to time as his services increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied the rates by 15% . His series is given in the following tabulation placed in comparison with the 20 series of the magnitude .01 to .1 :  | Barth points out that the principal difficulty in establishing wage scales of this kind is the objection raised by managers to what they consider an unduly high raise from one rate to the next . The reason is that most thinking in regard to wage rates is in arithmetical progression , that is , in the addition of a certain number of cents to an existing rate . As a matter of fact , " nobody can determine the value of the services of another , even as closely as 15%. "  | America has developed tremendous manufacturing power , as preceding chapters have shown . The productive process , making use of vast resources of materials , forces and human energy , is now at a higher level than has ever before been known in the history of the world . And still higher attainments are in sight . Preceding pages have presented a group of fundamentals that seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in upbuilding American industries . Now it is in order to examine the spirit and motive behind these laws and to evaluate in terms of human life and happiness what their application means . Such an examination reveals that the application of the laws of manufacturing management , while increasing prosperity and material wealth and contributing to the leisure , comfort and well-being of our people on the one hand , has fostered liberty , inspired progress and extended the concept of essential service on the other . The Spirit of Liberty The change in the attitude of management toward the workers from ancient times to the present well illustrates how the fundamentals of modern management have brought a large degree of economic freedom . In ancient times work was done by slave labor subject to the will of its masters . Individuals were but  | chattels and might be injured or killed with less thought than would be bestowed upon an animal today . Edward Herbert Thompson 71 has stated the law of work of those days as " Given human power , practically unlimited and unpaid for , powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of building the structures of the Mayas , he says : " Even though these ancient craftsmen of America had no tools of tempered metal with which to cut and carve the stone masses , columns , lintels , and building blocks , it did not matter much . They did not really need them . " They might have done the work quicker , but they would not have done it better , and in those days the time count of either craftsman or laborer was of even less value to the over-lord than is that of the greenest apprentice to the modern Captain of Industry . " Imagine for a moment a situation where some overlord ordered an increase in production , a hurrying up of the completion of some great building . It might have been a pyramid , a temple in Ur , an amphitheater in Greece , the Coliseum in Rome or a tomb in Chichen Itza , the Maya capitol and sacred city . Following such an order imagine a gathering of superintendents and foremen on the job . After discussion of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver would sum up the situation as regards labor with : " Make the wretches work . " footnote 71 Mr. Thompson is an engineer and scientist who has lived a number of years in Mexico and has conducted extensive explorations among the remains of the ancient Maya civilization . He found the mountain quarry from which were cut the huge blocks used in building Mictlan , the City of the Buried Zapotec Kings .  | Attitude During Middle Ages This attitude prevailed throughout the Middle Ages down to modern times and even into the factory era . With this difference , however , that the growth of political liberty took away from the employer the right to maim and kill and in the case of the worker substituted economic fear , poverty , for the fear of physical injury . The attitude toward labor throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is shown by a group of quotations from early economists . The author is indebted to Sam A. Lewisohn for this proof of economic savagery : " The spirit of early times is illustrated by a patent granted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' one of the chief advantages claimed for it being that by means of it a child of three or four years of age may do as much as a child seven or eight years old . " A writer named Mandeville said in 1714 : It would be easier , where property was well secured , to live without money than without poor , . . . who , as they ought to be kept from starving , so they should receive nothing worth saving . ' " A desire to enforce the industry of the working people led Josiah Tucker , in 1750 , to conclude that if the price of labor is continually beat down , it is greatly for the public good . ' " A writer on the " Management of the Poor " writes in 1767 : " Whenever either the legislature or private persons employ their care about the children of the poor the principal part of their plan should be to inure them to the lowest and most early labor . " Arthur Young said in 1771 : " Everyone but an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they will never be industrious ? they must be in poverty or they will not work . " John Weylord said in 1807 : " The lowest orders should endure a state bordering on want in order that a necessity may exist for their labor . " The Attitude of Today It has remained for our day and for an American management engineer to point out that workers are human and that they respond to the same kind of treatment as do all other individuals . The paper on " Training Workmen in Habits of Industry and Cooperation , " by Henry L. Gantt , has already been referred to . In this he declared that the policy of driving workmen must give way to a policy of leading . William Kent said of this paper : " I regard it as the most important that has ever appeared in the Transactions of the Society . " He gave as his reason that it was in harmony with humanitarian ideas . The three attitudes toward labor ? first , of the ancient world , second , of the century preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under modern management ? can be characterized in this wise : 1 . Make the wretches work . 2 . Keep the lower orders poor and make them work . 3 . Teach and lead your workers and so develop active cooperation between them and you . From this latter attitude comes relationships where foreman and worker meet as man to man . No longer does the worker cringe and shiver when the foreman  | approaches for each knows what is a fair output ; in fact , this is often a matter of mutual agreement . With much truth it can be said that this change reflects the growth of liberty in industrial relationships . The Spirit of Progress The effect of the causes stated in the laws of manufacturing management is to improve or better some feature of manufacturing operation . That is , every law is aimed toward something better . In this respect it is in keeping with the intent of all engineering and management work which is progressive , not ultimate . This progress is seen in every engineering and management achievement . Steam prime movers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gage is commercially employed . Electric voltages have increased from that of a single battery cell to , on experimental work , the forerunner of commercial practice , a million volts . Single airplane flights of a few hundred yards in 1907 have increased to more than 4,000 miles in 1928 . In and through all these achievements is one most important relationship . Progress becomes rapid only when facts are organized and principles formulated . Growth of Knowledge Dr. Hollis Godfrey has established the relationship between the dissemination of scientific , technical and trade knowledge and the growth of wealth in the United States . The curves are parallel from 1790 down to date , with that of scientific knowledge somewhat in the lead .  | The growth of knowledge falls into two stages . During the first , extending to about 1840 , facts were being accumulated and recorded ; during the second , facts were being organized and principles formulated . It is significant that 20% of the gain in wealth comes in the first stage and 80% in the second . And the growth and improvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal another aspect of the laws of manufacturing management ? the spirit of progress . In the light of this interpretation all of the laws should be applied . Like all other human knowledge they are in flux and flow as more discoveries are made , as the boundaries of understanding are pushed forward , as the frontier of knowledge is extended . Such , indeed , has been the development of every science . The Motive of Service To Henry L. Gantt we owe still another debt in this connection . He early recognized and emphatically declared that the doctrine of service should be applied in industry and that it pointed to the way to produce harmony between employer and employee . As early as 1919 he wrote : " In other words , we have proved in many places that the doctrine of service which has been preached in the churches as religion is not only good economics and eminently practical , but because of the increased production of goods obtained by it , promises to lead us safely through the maze of confusion into which we seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which alone can afford a basis for industrial peace .  | " This doctrine has been preached in the churches for nearly two thousand years , and for a while it seemed as if the Catholic Church of the middle ages would make it the controlling factor in the world ; but the breaking up of the Church in the middle ages into sects , and the advance of that intellectualism which placed more importance upon words and dogma than upon deeds , gave a setback to the idea which has lasted for centuries . The Reward of Service Others have dealt with this same thought and motive approaching it from the profit side of manufacturing operation . Here Benjamin A. Franklin , 72 vice-president of the Strathmore Paper Company , has been one of the clearest thinkers : " Every industrial executive and every owner in an industrial enterprise , whether in whole or in part , strives for and desires a profit . This is the essential reason for ownership . But ownership is no longer , if it ever was , a warrant for profit , for profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The public is only willing to pay a profit for service , and , with the wider spread of industry , for the best service ; therefore , essentially and fundamentally , industry is a service . " If industry is conducted as a service , then certainly the public must expect to reward that service and the renderer of that service is entitled to expect a steady and reasonable profit , for that is the essential urge to begin and continue rendering service . " The National Machine Tool Builders Association 73 footnote " The Industrial Executive , p. 100 . " Guide for Applying Code of Ethics .  | has declared : " The reward of business for service rendered is a fair profit plus a safe reserve , commensurate with risks involved and foresight executed . " Gerard Swope , 74 president of the General Electric Company , forcefully supports this same point of view : " The reason for the existence of industrial organizations is not first and primarily for profit , but to furnish the community with something the community desires to have . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good quality and at a fair price , it will always be rewarded for that service by an adequate profit . " Many more quotations of this tenor might be included but enough have been given from eminent authorities to show that the motive of service is active in the forward development of management in manufacturing . The Goal One more point now needs to be examined . What is the promise and goal of manufacturing industries if the present progress continues ? James J. Davis , Secretary , United States Department of Labor , has this to say as to what has been done : " Science is as old as history itself , and has grown to be a great and many sided thing . But I believe it has fallen to America to develop the highest science of all . I mean the science that takes all the other sciences and puts them to practical use for the benefit of men ? the benefit of every man . I mean the science of management . footnote 44 From an address before the Illinois Manufacturers ' Association , December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only here in America has the life of the working man been really enriched . . . . We have shortened his hours , lightened his labors . He used to need muscle , and we have given him endless steam and electric power instead . He used to need a handicraft that cost him years to acquire , and we have given him machinery of wonderful cunning . With power and machinery one man produces with ease more wealth than hundreds produced with heart-breaking and backbreaking toil . And he shares in the wealth he produces in the form of higher wages than workers were ever paid before . " Such is the process that is going on as seen by one who is in close contact with the condition of life of the American worker . Irving Fisher has pictured the goal in more positive terms . Commenting on the report of the department of Commerce on the national income for the period 1921-1925 , he writes : 75 " .. . it represents the most astonishing gain in real income yet shown by any nation .
