Herbert Clark Hoover never spent a more eventful week than last . <P> He listened attentively at the radio , nodded approvingly as Senator Smoot droned the G. O. Platform into the Missouri microphones . <P> On the evening , friends assembled in the living room of the Hoover home . Negro butlers , directed by Mrs. Hoover , served lemonade . There were carnations in the vases . Associate Justice Stone , of the U. S. Supreme Court , and Mrs. Stone were there ; also the Vernon Kelloggs , George Barr Baker , assistant to the Attorney General , William J. ( " Wild Bill " ) Donovan , Mrs. William E. Borah , and the Herbert Clark Hoover Jrs . Herbert Clark Hoover III and Peggy Anne Hoover were put to bed long before anything exciting happened. * <P> The radio was going . Shortly after the monstrous voice of John L. McNab was heard , at about eight o'clock , the radio sounded as if it had broken . It began to roar , hum , shriek , blare , clatter . The Beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Mr. Hoover walked in and out of the living room , gnawing cigars . A bat flew in at the window . Guests and butlers chased it upstairs . <P> The balloting began coming over the radio . Guests kept score . When the nomination was complete , Mrs. Hoover went to her husband and took both his hands in hers , but said nothing . A few minutes later , he appeared to newsgatherers in an outer room . " I ca n't say anything tonight , gentlemen . Of course , I 'm very happy , " he said . <P> The radio reported the telegram which Chairman Moses was sending from the convention to its nominee : " It is not so much that we give you this nomination as that you have earned the right to it ... etc. , etc . " <P> But the greatest moment in the Beaver Man 's life up to that time did not arrive until the actual telegram came and he could issue his acceptance . <P> " You convey too great a compliment when you say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can establish such an obligation upon any part of the American people . My country owes me no debt . It gave me , as it gives every boy and girl , a chance . . . . <P> " My whole life has taught me what America means . I am indebted to my country beyond any human power to repay . It conferred upon me the mission to administer America 's response to the appeal of afflicted nations during the War . It has called me into two Cabinets of two Presidents . By these experiences I have observed the burdens and responsibilities of the greatest office in the world . That office touches the happiness of every home . It deals with the peace of nations . No man could think of it except in terms of solemn consecration . <P> " You ask me for a message : <P> " . . . At a later date I shall discuss it ( the platform ) fully , but in the meantime I may well say that under the principles the victory of the party will assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protect American workmen , farmers and businessmen alike from competition arising out of lower standards of living abroad , foster individual initiative , insure stability of business and employment , promote our foreign commerce and develop our national resources .
