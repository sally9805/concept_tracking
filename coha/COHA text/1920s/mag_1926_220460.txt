Republican Presidential possibilities discreetly , anxiously , even feverishly await the day when President Coolidge decides whether or not he is going to be a candidate for a third term . Administrationists in Washington , D. C. , say certainly ; farm blocers in the Middle West say not a chance ; the President does not say . <P> Last week Senator Albert S. Cummins , he who was defeated in the Iowa primaries by Smith W. ( " Wildman " ) Brookhart , informed the press that Mr. Coolidge would not be a candidate in 1928 , that he would have had enough of the Presidency by that time . But the Senator is naturally pessimistic . <P> The deciding factor of the Coolidge candidacy seems to hinge on the outcome of this fall 's Congressional elections . In the Senate , the Democrats now have 39 members ; are in danger of losing none ; have good chances of gaining from four to ten seats . However , they do not forget the late Senator Medill McCormick 's poignant remark after the 1924 Republican Convention : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats will ball things up for themselves , somehow .
