Met a group of solemn judges , their faces reflective of the well-nigh sinister gravity of their office . They were the Hanging Committee . All week they labored , considering case after case , ever and again despaching small dockets which prescribed the action of certain hirelings who , with hammer , rope , wire , went about their business in the Anderson Galleries , Manhattan . They were preparing for the exhibition of the New Society of Artists . The doors of the gallery opened , the judgments of the committee and the consequent hangings stood patent to oglers . <P> Hung , elegant among the rabble , were two women . They did not twist in grisly contortion from any gibbet 's arm , not they , but sat side by side upon a sofa which George Bellows had painted . Now , for all the intimacy of their attitudes , there was a difference in the semblance , perhaps in the very characters of these two women , apparent at once to the least curious eye , for whereas the one was garbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was naked Mr. Bellows was more successful in drawing attention to his painting than he had been in drawing the left arm of his clothed lady , which was signally elongated . <P> Guy Pene Du Bois was represented with a full length portrait of a woman standing against a vast expanse of light blue background-a most interesting portrait . Robert Henri exhibited a number of quick , nervous impressions of Irish lads and colleens ; John Sloan was twice hung-once in a merry-go-round , again in a group at a country fair ; Boardman Robinson , returning to painting after many successful years of black and white , also sent two canvases .
