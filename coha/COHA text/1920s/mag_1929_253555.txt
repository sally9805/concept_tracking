President Harold F. Pitcairn of Pitcairn Aviation , Inc. , has found such promise in Juan de la Cierva 's Autogiro that last week he organized Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Co. of America to develop the autogiro in this country . <P> In fuselage , tail structure , landing gear and propelling motor the autogiro is a typical airplane . But for wings it has four great vanes fixed on a vertical mast so as to revolve horizontally . They have no motor as have the horizontal propellers of helicopters . <P> As the propeller motor pulls the autogiro across a flying field the forward motion sets the vanes revolving swiftly , like a great pinwheel . As they turn they create a lifting surface equivalent to a standard plane 's wings . <P> The autogiro 's most valuable feature is that it can descend almost vertically , and on almost any sort of field . <P> Soon Mr. Pitcairn and Seor de la Cierva may be reimbursed for their experimental investment . The autogiro is entered in the Guggenheim Fund 's " safe aircraft competition " to develop an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian manufacturers have already entered the competition . First prize is $100,000 . There are also five $10,000 prizes .
