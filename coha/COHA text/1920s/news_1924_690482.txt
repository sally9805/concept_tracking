txt The President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , which began its meeting at Toronto last night , is a parasitologist who is also a Major General . Sir DAvm C. Beuce . The theme of his address was preventive medicine , and his proposals are stated in military terms . The enemy is the pathogenic germ  --  the man-pip  --  ying parasite . Sir DAVID 'S general plan of campaign is set forth in the statement : " Medicine " in the future must change its strat " egy : instead of awaiting attack , it " . must assume the offensive . " An offensive mobilization is urged : The medical practitioner of the future must frequently examine people while they are apparently well In order to detect an incipient departure from the normal , and to teach and urge modes of living conformable to the laws of personal health , and the public health authorities must see to it that environment is in accordance with scientific teaching . Had Sir DAVID lived in the day of " The BRUCE , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health officials , he might have prevented that King of Scotland from incurring the microbial disease , due to the bacillus leprae , or dying at the early age of 55 . But that was long before the days of PASTEUR . As the annual report of the Rockefeller International Health Board states , practice has not caught up with knowledge even yet . Most diseases are preventable . The very natural question which King EDWARD VII . once put was " if preventable , why not prevented ? " The answer is that knowledge has not been translated into the consciousness and practice of the millions . This is due to the slow pace at which education goes ; to the indifference of the individual to anything.until pain comes , and to the expense of public prevention and protection by means of inspection , examination , disinfection , inoculation , quarantine and a score of other processes . Dr. VERNON KELLOGG said two or three years ago in an Atlantic Monthly article that there are many biological facts that would be helpful to the people if only these facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Health Department has used the slogan : " Health is purchasable . " But while in the end health is worth all that a community has to pay for it , it does involve a heavy outlay of effort and money , and sometimes the community has n't the price . The ' ounces of prevention are very expensive , even if they cost infinitely less than the cure . Public health is. essentially a function of Government , though private agencies have been helpful in making pioneer demonstrations . Each new discovery in medicine may have an application in public health . How it can be made , what it will cost and how it will affect the future of the community are questions which the great health philanthropies assist in answering . They can help practice to catch up with knowledge . That praetic4does sometimes catch up Is evidenced by the victories over yellow fever , the control of malaria in an average community at a per capita cost of from 45 cents to $1 a year , the control of the hookworm disease and the promotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reducing infant mortality in the great cities so that it is now lower than in smaller communities Is a convincing proof that health can be bought , If only the public is willing to pay for it . Sir DA.vm points to the demonstrable loss of not preventing the preventable even at the necessary cost . He estimates that the value of prevention ' in terms of money in England and Wales alone amounts to ? 150 000 000 and. - that the annual ' loss in the United States is ? 600,000 , - 000 . But the financial loss is only a fraction of the total . Sir Davin BRUCE proposes a monument in every community to the memory of PASTEUR , There is hardly a city or village in France that has n't a street or square named for him , besides numerous monuments dedicated to him . If all the lives his discoveries have saved or lengthened in the United Stites could be reckoned in dollars and cents , and that amount set against France 's war debt to the , United States , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French to pay . Be that as it may , our communities can best pay their homage to PASTEUR not by setting up monuments but by making appropriations for preventing disease .
