Not all men are stereotyped doctors , lawyers , Indian chiefs . In Georgia , last week , death came to a terrapin-hatcher ( see p. 63 ) . And in Georgia , 55 years ago , was born a man destined to be an expert marble-mover . This man , too , died , last week . <P> Marble is the aristocrat of sculptural materials . Like an aristocrat it is sumptuous but brittle . Subjected to undue stresses it splits and cracks . Thus the transportation of marble is ticklish , and can not be done with casual maneuvering as can steel girders . Sculptors exercise prodigious care in moving marble statuary from studios to sites . One fissure will ruin the labor of years , and one fissure may be produced by the slip of one gawkish moving man. * <P> Emmett Lawrence of Georgia could move marble statuary . And many a sculptor found it out . Frederick MacMonnies , Daniel Chester French , Augustus Saint-Gaudens , George Grey Barnard-all employed Emmett Lawrence . They knew little about him , but it was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread slowly and mysteriously . He knew just what joists to build , what pressures to apply . With perhaps five or six assistants , he would work for hours over slow shifts and perilous easements . Emmett Lawrence eyed and estimated , gave the commands . Often night fell or rains came but there was no stopping . The placing of a marble statue is one task that must be completed without pause . <P> Emmett Lawrence was always on call , a rare and curious technician . He went to perform his unadvertised handiwork in most of the large Eastern cities . Among his placements were the two lions which crouch before the entrance of the New York Public Library . During 30 years of work , he never broke or marred a statue . <P> Two years ago he contracted consumption . That dignified patrician , Sculptor George Grey Bernard , received the invalid into his studio and there he stayed for six months . Later he went to a hospital . At the end of a year , Sculptor Barnard took him back to the studio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmett Lawrence 's strange gift , " says Sculptor Barnard , " comes to perhaps one man in many thousands . He obeyed the laws of gravity with uncanny instinct , toiled always with supreme patience , and was one of the finest characters I have ever known . He could judge by his eye , to the fraction of an inch , if a statue weighing tons was off balance . . . Some day I hope to do something in the way of a memorial for him . " <P> <P> *Sculptor Jo Davidson spent nine hours , missed a dinner party , watching his statue of the late , great Senator La Follette being moved into Manhattan 's Anderson Galleries ( TIME , Feb. 11 ) .
