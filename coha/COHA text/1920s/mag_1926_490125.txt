We doubt that any distin guished man cares about rushing through the streets surrounded by policemen blowing horns , and suspect that the parades are in honor of small town mayors and beauty contest winners .

Pointed THIS may he an old story but we print it because it will be of use to Miss Spence 's School : Mr. Craig Biddle , at Hollywood several months ago , was cast for the role of a gentleman . Being required to enter a mansion , he nodded cordially to the footman , as a familiar of the household , handed over his topcoat , his hat and stick , and ' stepped out of the scene . The director , however , was not satisfied . He said as much and thereupon undertook to show Mr. Biddle how it should he done . When he was admitted , he passed his things to the footman , marched past that dignitary with never a sign of recognition , and then , pausing before a pier-glass in the reception hall , proceeded to arrange his hair with a comb abstracted from a waistcoat pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your appearance , " he admonished Mr. Biddle .

" HERE is a tiny place in East Forty-fifth Street where some of the old Delmonicos clientele lunch and dine occasionally now , partly because the food is what they consider good for these days , but chiefly because one of Delmonicos ' captains is manager there . Here a member of the older generation held forth one evening recently , on the glory that was Delmonicos . " You can never imagine " , said he , " what an esprit de corps there was among the old waiters . They were proud of themselves and their associates . Which was why the service was so good . Such service is no more , except where there is an odd survival of that company . There were some fine characters among Delmonicos ' staff .

And Barney the Oysterman  --  passed beyond , we hear  --  who took such pride in his clam chowder that he would not even let the head chef make a suggestion about it . It was gorgeous clam chowder " , said the mouthpiece of the older generation . " And " , he continued after a pause long enough for a sigh , " the waiter of today is a different type from the one of two decades ago , The immigration restrictions have something to do with this , since the cream of the foreign waiters no longer come here . But the chief reason is that waiters can not retain their self-respect now " , the old gentleman concluded sadly . The new generation does not know how to treat their servants . They are curt and sometimes abusive ; so men with pride no longer enter what was once an honorable and comfortable way of making a livelihood . THERE may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , it will he Delmonico 's with the apostrophe , and not Delmonicos , without , which latter was the case when the four members of the same family held interest in , what was then the city 's most distinguished restaurant . Traditions , the new promoters of the enterprise are likely to discover , can not be suspended for ten years or so and then resumed as though nothing had intervened . It would seem the wiser course for the new to forget the old and to try to devise for itself some such distinguishing glory as was Lobster a la Newberg in the brave days when Delmonices had fallen in with the upward trend of fashion and had moved . from Union Square to its Twenty-sixth Street site . Again , there is the matter of fortune , rather than design , for the first concocting of Lobster A is Newberg was done by Mr. Ben Wenberg , a great beau of his time and a crony of Mr. Charles Delmonico . Every Sunday at noon Mr. Wen-berg would make ceremonious entry into the dining room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same table near the Fifth Avenue side of the establishment . In one of the pockets of his silk-velvet embroidered waistcoat , he always carried a small bottle of the fiery red pepper which lent its peculiar savor to the method he had invented for preparing lobster . The waiters brought him all the rest of the condiments , sauces , wines , and the other ingredients , as well as the chafing dish he employed . This concoction was known first as Lobster a la Wenberg , but after a quarrel between the two friends , Mr. Charles Delmonico ordered its name changed on the menu cards to read , Lobster a la Newberg ; and , since the two never were reconciled , so the name remains . Tale of the Sea LUNCHEON in the ward room of the Cruiser Rochester , which is tied up at the Brooklyn Navy Yard , is generally a pleasant occasion for Commander McNair , except for one invariable circumstance .

A day or two ago , however , a new sort of telegram was handed to Commander McNair . With a bellow of delight , he read it to the assembled officers : " Having a whale of a time , " it ran , " and there 's still a little money left . Can I have five additional days to spend it ? " The signature was that of a Marine private . " There 's a leatherneck ! " chortled the commander . " Tell him to take his five days , and when he comes back have him made a corporal . " Walking PERHAPS unwittingly , Dr. John H. Finley , of the Times , is promoting the best solution of the traffic problem thus far advanced ; he has offered to everyone who does a certain amount of walking within a year , a medal having a figure of a hiker and inscribed , " a la Sainte Terre " . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , when the twelvemonth period has elapsed , to those who have completed one thousand miles within the year . Their walks are supposed to be daily matters and must include one hike of at least twentysix miles , the distance around Manhattan Island . Anyone doing one hundred miles on a boat while crossing the Atlantic is eligible for a medal , too ; par for this was set by Dr. Finley and Mr. Roald Amundsen , the discoverer of the South Pole , when they crossed together on the Adriatic . Since last Easter Dr. Finley has walked approximately one thousand eight hundred miles , so he has qualified for his own prize ; three men and a girl have notified him , thus far , that they have met the requirements . Innovation QAMMY LEE ? despite " Sky-kJ scrapers " program 's dignified " Samuel " ? has the distinction of being the first American director to put something American on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera . And though the honor is not particularly remunerative ( at least from the viewpoint of a producer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , and " Tip Toes " ) it still carries with it a goodly amount of glory . To all of which Mr. Lee is so happily unconscious that the other afternoon , as we watched " Skyscrapers " rehearsal , we were amused to see him three times fail to respond when addressed by the respectful term of " Maestro " . Originally a song and dance man , he first began staging productions during the war and is the first of the so-called " Broadway gang " to get into the Metropolitan . They gave him quite a free hand , they say , to put John Carpenter 's opera on just as he wished , training the sedate Metropolitan ballet to the intricacies of jazz or bringing in already initiated dancers of his own . He chose , however , to make jazz babies of the former . " And , " added Mr. Lee , " they loved it . " Camouflage WHILE walking with a friend along Forty-eighth Street the other day we caught sight of a strangephenomenon on top of the Collegiate Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the coffin of a former wealthy vestryman who left a large sum to the church with the unique proviso that he be laid to rest on the church 's roof . Now with due respect to our friend , he is not always noted for his veracity ; and yet , we reflected , the object on the roof was certainly a coffin and nothing else . Anyone not believing us has only to he himself to Forty-eighth Street and take a look . So we decided to investigate ; for we pride ourself on our nose for news . We accosted the first official-looking person we met on entering the church . He had a forbidding air , as though he might know all the funereal secrets of the world , but we could n't quite make up our mind how to begin . We thought of saying , " Aha , what have you got on your roof ? " But this , we reflected , would lay us open to " shingles " ; so we just said tactfully , pointing up , " Is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrain from printing his answer in full . Suffice it to say , he was a very rude person to find in a church . It is n't our fault that he is asked the same question seventeen times a week , and we resent his statement that we might have a nose for news but we have n't got much of an eye for beauty . The fact that it is a chimney does n't appease us in the least . We may have a strange sense of beauty , but we feel that chimneys should look like chimneys and that coffins should look like coffins . Attractions TO settle once and for all certain inquiries from our musically inclined readers , we wish to hurl the following facts . We learn : That less than a dozen artists can sell out Carnegie Hall completely , and not more than fifty can make expenses oftener than once a year in recital at any of New York 's music auditoriums , except perhaps in the two intimate salons in Fifty-seventh Street ? Steinway and Chickering Halls ; that the two greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom have adventitious aid from their war records ; that Kreisler , because he is less spectacular than Paderewski from a publicity angle , is the most remarkable drawing-card in the history of New York , his recitals usually being all but sold out even before they are announced ; that the Carnegie Hall box office receives inquiries every day concerning the dates of Kreisler concerts , those wanting to hear Kreisler seeming to make it their business to discover when he is to play ; that his programs rarely arc announced in advance , the total advertising bill for each concert probably not exceeding more than $15o ; that advertising expenses for most first class artists usually range from $35o to $800 per concert . We further learn : That John McCormack is the greatest drawing card among recital sing-ers and is capable of selling out four or five times yearly ; that in the past two years Roland Hayes has ac-quired almost as great a vogue locally , but it remains to he seen whether he will hold his popu-larity after the sentimental appeal which makes his art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling out , but frequently the high prices charged for his con-certs leave tickets unsold ; that he is perhaps the only male singer who is a magnet here in both opera and concert , with Gigli his closest contender . And this settles our questionnaire for this week at least . Riposte WE remarked several weeks ago on the Renaissance of the graceful art of fencing . But we did n't know at the time there was any danger of fencing masters being threatened with Rolls Royces . The source of the threat is , of course , the source of all Rolls Royces  --  i.e. the movies . When a fencing scene is required by the script , it appears it is necessary to have it rehearsed to the last detail of footing , which is done entirely according to long-prepared routine . Not an extemporaneous pose in the entire program . This means fencing masters ; except , they say , in the case of Douglas Fairbanks who is reputed to have an amateur 's acquaintance with swordsmanship . For Valentino 's " Monsieur Beaucaire " a Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a New York master coached for " When Knighthood Was In Flower " , and another local master frequently in demand is M. Louis Senac . It was he this season who coached Basil Sydney and Walter Hampden in the use of foils . He has also instructed John Barrymore  --  but not much , they say . unusual features were that the stock was given to the General Manager and that any earnings over and above those required by the dividends were paid to the Manager as a bonus  --  and that he was able to buy back the stock at a slight advance any time he wanted . That was Rockwell Kent , Incorporated , and it now exists only in name ; for Mr. Kent has recently bought back all the stock and now owns himself entirely and puts whatever money he makes directly into his pocket . FROM a distance he appears like a neatly dressed broker who has grown a little bald in the rooms of the Exchange . But as you approach him you observe that his eyes arc full of ideas , enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man who lives hand and glove with his own imagination and sets much store by it . He has never had a studio . A hall bedroom with a chair to sit on and another one on which to put a canvas are quite enough equipment , and in such a place he can paint a seascape happily . He is one of those fortunate men who always have time . He has found time while painting to make a name for himself as Hogarth Junior in black and white ; he studied architecture at Columbia , he is an expert carpenter and once joined the Carpenters and Joiners Union . He has been to Tierra del Fuego , he spent almost a year in the North , he is familiar with modern processes of reproduction and is , himself , a lithographer . Woodcuts , of course . What he loves most to talk about is craftsmanship , which , he says , so many modern painters overlook  --  that being an architect will help your painting , that being a sculptor will help ; that art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of equipping yourself to perform . La Danse THE Charleston , it has been decreed , is to become our national dance . Mr. Ned Wayburn , who has staged no less than 50o Broadway shows in the past few years , is now busy in his Sixtieth Street studio putting a final polish on i , 5oo embryo teachers and performers , and assures us that only the past week he has signed contracts calling for this expenditure for no other purpose than to establish his version of the Charleston once and for all as a permanently  --  or rather the permanently  --  accepted dance . Stout ladies and elderly gentlemen notwithstanding , Mr. Way-burn plans during the next few months to launch fifty teams of entertainers to introduce his interpretation of the dance in every state . " Not the commonly accepted , vulgar Charleston , " he explained to us , with a modest gesture , " but the artistic , the aesthetic , the beautiful Charleston as originally invented and worked out by me . " Item A LITTLE old lady in a black silk dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker Book Co. and finally called a salesman . " Have you ' The Life of Cole Younger ' ? It is an old book and out of print . " Frank Walters , who is Baker 's Americana expert , said they had a single copy and stood back in mild wonder as the gentle old lady lingeringly thumbed its pages . For Cole Younger was a celebrity of those sweet old days of the Civil War period , when Kansas went to war with Missouri . Being a Missourian , Cole Younger , of course , espoused the noble cause of the latter ; then fought as a guerilla with Quantrell during the Civil War ; and afterwards , on meeting Jesse James , turned his attention to the banks of his state , which he robbed together with those of Kentucky , Louisiana , Iowa , Minnesota , and even Virginia . He was a hard and brutal fighter . Always chivalrous and polite , he was , in short , a gentleman to the manner born  --  the sort of man who in England a few generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jailed . " Yes , " said his gentle admirer in the Lexington Avenue bookshop the other day , " this is the book I want , the very one . " The price , she was told , was five dollars . " Five dollars ! " Her lips trembled " It 's a lot for me to pay for a book . " The old lady fingered a slender purse . " I 'll take it , " she said . " It 's too much for me , but I must have the book . You see I am Mrs. Cole Younger . " Safety First AND now some big bad man has frightened Gigli again . It has been said , of course , that just as actresses lose their jewels Italian tenors receive black hand letters . In the case of a certain Chicago opera singer a convenient black hand letter even arrived whenever there was an empty house . With Gigli , however , it is different , and we are honestly convinced that the motives for his Detroit flight were genuine . We even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York and it was terrifying  --  just like a verse by Amy Lowell , is the way it ran ; then terminated with the courteous Latin admonition : " In case of your refusal to oblige us we will be compelled to act against our desire . " Gigli , it will be remembered , immediately secured a private detective to accompany him wherever he went , and another to protect his wife . Then he secured one for his little daughter , Rina , and another detective for his little son , Enzo . In fact such elaborate precautions were taken that he succeeded in long-distance frightening his black-mailers in Los Angeles , California , thereby preventing them from being captured . CARUSO 'S experience with the V. ) Camorra , it will be remembered , was somewhat different . On reception of his letter he promptly turned it over to the police ; then agreed to deliver in person the money demanded by the blackmailers . In a lonely spot in Brooklyn he arrived one night with a roll of banknotes , the Italian squad of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extremely nervous was only natural in view of the bullets expected to fly . His Camor --  ristically inclined friends , however , attributing this nervousness solely to fear of themselves , reassuringly took the money from him and were forthwith pounced on and captured by the police , with never a single shot fired . Missionary WHOEVER would have attributed " Love ' Em and Leave ' Em " to the efforts of Dr. Guthrie ? Yet this is the astonishing discovery just made by us with regard to the pastor of St. Mark's-in-the-Bouwerie . Once upon a time it appears John V. A. Weaver , co-author with George Abbot of " Love ' Em and Leave ' Em " , was secretary to that efficient minister , who had the sudden happy idea of sending his secretary to Columbia to mingle with the students in the extension courses and lure them to church . Since Dr. Guthrie was willing to pay the tuition and Weaver had always had a desire to study short story writing , he elected that course . The results were satisfactory to Weaver . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold it the next day to a magazine of which a friend was editor . Thus was Dr. Guthrie responsible for the beginning of Mr. Weaver 's literary career which has now reached the pinnacle of " Love ' Em and Leave 3Em , , .
