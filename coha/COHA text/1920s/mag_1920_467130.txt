IN order that any species of animals I may come to rule any planet , two qualities at the very least would seem necessary : some form of desire to urge them on and on , and also adaptability of a thousand kinds to their environ ? ment . So far as adaptability is concerned , we humans are experts . We talk of our " mastery " of nature , which sounds very grand ; but the fact is we respectfully adapt ourselves first to her ways . " We attain no power over nature Lill we learn natural laws , and our lordship depends on the adroitness with which we learn and conform . " Adroitness , however , is merely an ability to win ; back of it there must be some spur to make us use our adroitness . Why do n't we all die or give up when we 're sick of the world ? Because the love of life takes the form , in most ener ? gized beings , of some longing that pushes them forward , in defeat and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to live and perpetuate their species ; but those two wishes in themselves evidently do not carry any race far . In addition to these , a race to be great needs some hunger , some itch , to spur it up the hard path we have lately learned to call evolution . The love of toil in the ants , and of craft in cats , are examples ( imag ? inary or not ) . What other such lust could exert great driving force ? With us is it curiosity , endless interest in one 's environment ? Many animals have some curiosity , but " some " is not enough ; and in very few is it really a master passion . By a master passion I mean a passion that is your master ? some appetite which ha ? bitually , day in , day out , makes its subjeels forget fatigue or danger , and sacri ? fice their ease to its gratification . That is the kind of hold that curiosity has on the monkeys . Imagine a prehistoric prophet observ ? ing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would build . Any one could have fore ? seen certain parts of the simians ' history could have guessed that their curiosity would unlock for them , one by one , nature 's doors , and ? idly ? bestow on them stray bits of valuable knowledge ; could have pictured them spreading in ? quiringly all over the globe , stumbling on their inventions ? and idly passing on and forgetting them . To have to learn the same thing over and over again wastes the time of a race . But with simians this is continu ? ally necessary , because of their disorder . " Disorder , " a prophet would have sighed ? " that is one of their handicaps ; one that they will never get rid of , what ? ever it costs . Having so much curiosity makes a race scatterbrained . " Yes , " he would have dismally con ? tinued , " it will be a queer mixture ; these simians will attain to vast stores of knowledge , in time , that is plain , but , af ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in after-centuries they will now and then find it 's forgotten . How incredible it would seem on other planets to hear of lost arts . " There is a strong streak of triviality in them , which you do n't see in cats . They wo n't have fine enough characters to concentrate on the things of most weight . They will talk and think far more of trifles than of what is important . Even when they are reasonably civilized this will be so . Great discoveries some ? times will fail to be heard of , because too much else is ; and many will thus disap ? pear , and these men will not know it . If they rescue one such as Mendel 's from the dust-heap it will he an exception . " Let me interrupt this lament to say a word for myself and my ancestors . It is easy to blame us as undiscriminating , but we are at least full of zest . And it 's well to be interested , eagerly and in ? tensely , in so many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out important . We do n't go around being interested on purpose , hoping to profit by it , but a profit may come . And , any ? way , it is generous of us not to be too self-absorbed . Other creatures go to the other extreme Lo an amazing extent . They are ridiculously oblivious to what is going on . The smallest ant in the gar ? den will ignore the largest woman who visits it . She is a. huge and most danger ? ous super-mammoth in relation to him , and her tread shakes the earth ; but he has no time to be bothered , investigating such Iike phenomena . He wo n't even get out of her way . He has his work to do , hang it ! Birds and squirrels have less of this glorious independence of spirit . They watch you closely ? if you move around , but not if you keep still . In other words , they pay no more attention than they can help , even to mammoths . We , of course , observe everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ? ing on . Consider our museums , for in ? stance ; they are a sign of our breed . It makes us smile to see birds , like the magpie , with a mania for this collecting ; but only monkeyish beings could rever ? ence museums as we do , and pile such heterogeneous trifles and quantities in them . Old furniture , egg-shells , watches , bits of stone . . . . And next door ? a " menagerie . " Though our victory over all other animals is now eons old , we still bring home captives and exhibit them caged in our cities . And when a species dies out ? or is crowded ( by us ) off the planet ? we even collect the bones of the vanquished and show them like trophies . To go hack to our prophet . Curiosity is a valuable trait ( I can imagine hint saying ) . It will make the simians learn many things . But the curiosity of a simian is as excessive as the toil of an ant . Each simian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to speak of what it could ever deal with ; and those whose minds are active will wish to know everything going . It would stretch a god 's skull to accom ? plish such an ambition , yet simians wo n't like to think it 's beyond their powers . Even small tradesmen and clerks , no matter how thrifty , will be eager to buy costly encyclopedias , or books of all knowledge . Almost every simian family , even the dullest , will think it is due to itself to keep all knowledge handy . Their idea of a liberal education will therefore be pretty hodge-podge . If it is heterogeneous enough they will be sure it is " liberal . " He who narrows his field of study will be viewed with dis ? trust . Critics will simply say , " It is narrow " ? and feel they have pelted him with an unbearable epithet . If more than one man in a hundred should thus dare to concentrate , the ruinous effects of being a mere " specialist " will be sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have to admit ; but , still , they will feel badly and fear that civilization will suffer . One of their curious educational ideas ? but a natural one ? will be shown in the efforts they will make to learn more than one " language . " They will set their young to spending a decade or more of their lives in studying duplicate systems ? whole systems of chatter . Those who thus /earn several different ways to say the seine things will com- ? mand much respect , and those who , learn many will be looked on with awe ? by true simians . And persons without this accomplishment will be looked down:i on a little and will actually feel . quite apologetic about it themselves . Consider how enormously complicated a complete language must be , with its long and arbitrary vocabulary , its intri ? cate system of sounds , the many forms that single words may take , especially if they are verbs , the rules of grammar , the sentence structure , the idioms , slang , and inflections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( You remember what Kipling says in the Jungle Books , about how disgusted the quiet animals were with the Bandarlog , because they were eternally chattering , would never keep still . Well , this is the good side of it . ) Where another race , after the most frightful discord and pains , might have slowly constructed one language before this earth grew cold , this race will create literally hundreds , each complete in itself , and many of them with quaint little systems of writ ? ing attached . And the owners of this linguistic gift are so humble about it , they will marvel at bees , for their hives , and at beavers ' mere dams . To return , however , to their fear of being too narrow ; in going to the other extreme they will run to incredible lengths . Every civilized simian , every day of his life , in addition to all the older facts he has picked up , will wish to know all the " news " of all the world . If he felt any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine of him ? it would imply such a close solidarity on the part of his genus . ( Such a close solidarity would seem crushing , to others ; but that is another matter . ) It wo n't be true concern , however ; it will be merely his blind , inherited instinct . He 'll forget what he 's read , the very next hour , or moment . Yet there he will faithfully sit , the ridiculous creature , reading of bombs in Spain or floods in Tibet , and espe ? cially insisting on all the news he can get of the kind his race loved when they hung by their tails in the forest , news that will stir his most primitive simian feelings ? wars , accidents , love-affairs , and family quarrels . To feed himself with this largely pur ? poseless provender he will pay thousands of simians to be reporters of such events day and night , and they will report them on such a voluminous scale as to smother or obscure more significant news alto ? gether . Great printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the laziest of this lazy race will not think it labor to perform this toil . They wo n't like to eat in the morning without their " papers , " such slaves they will he to this weird greed for knowing . They wo n't even think it is weird , it is so in their blood . Their swollen desire for investigating everything about them , including espe ? cially other people 's affairs , will be quenchless . Few will feel that they really are " fully informed , " and all will spend much of their days in this way ? and their lives . " Books , " too , will be used to slake this unappeasable thirst . They will actually hold books in deep reverence . Books ! Bottled chatter ! Things that some other simian has formerly said . They will dress them in costly bindings , keep them under glass , and take an affecting pride in the number they read . Libraries ? storehouses of books ? will dot their world . The destruction of one will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simian civilization . ) Well , it is an offense , to be sure ? a bar ? baric offense . But so is defacing forever a beautiful landscape ; and they wo n't even notice that sometimes ; they wo n't shudder , . any-way , the way they instinc ? tively do at the loss of a " library . " All this is inevitable and natural , and they can not help it . There are even ways one can justify excesses like this . If their hunger for books ever seems in ? discriminate to them when they them ? selves stop to examine it , they will have their excuses . They will argue that some bits of knowledge they once7iad thought futile had later on come in most handy , in unthought-of ways . True enough ! For their scientists . But not for their average men ; they will simply be like obstinate housekeepers who clog up their homes , preserving odd boxes and wrappings , and stray lengths of string , to exult if but one is of some trifling use ere they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cherish their books , and pile them up everywhere into great indis ? criminate mounds ; and these mounds will seem signs of culture and sagacity to them . Those who know many facts will feel wise ! They will despise those who do n't . They will even believe , many of them , that knowledge is power . Unfortunate dupes of this saying will keep on read ? ing , ambitiously , till they have stunned their native initiative and made their thoughts weak , and will then wonder dazedly what in the world is the mat ? ter , and why the great power they were expecting to gain fails to appear . Again , if they ever forget what , they read , they 'll be worried . Those who can forget ? those who can luckily rid their poor crowded minds of such facts as the month , day , and year that their children were born , or the numbers on houses , or the " names " ( the mere meaningless labels ) of the people they meet ? will be urged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their itch is rather for knowing than for understanding or thinking . Some of them will learn to think , doubtless , and even to concen ? trate , but their eagerness to acquire those accomplishments will not be strong or insistent . Creatures whose mainspring is curiosity will enjoy the accumulating of facts far more than the pausing at times to reflect on those facts . If they do not reflect on them , of course , they 'll be slow to find out about the ideas and relationships lying behind them ; and they will be curious about those ideas , so you would think- they would reflect . But deep thinking is painful . It means they must channel the spreading rivers of their attention . That can not be done without discipline and drills for the mind , and they will abhor doing that ; their minds will work better when they are left free to run off at tangents . Compare them in this with other species . Each has its own kind of strength . To he compelled to be as quick-minded as the simians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one idea , week by week , without trying at all ; but they would all have brain-fever in an hour at a simian tea . A super-cow people would revel in long , thought ? ful books on abstruse philosophical sub ? jects , and would sit up late reading them . Most of the ambitious simians who try of pride , go to sleep . The typ ? ical simian brain is supremely distracta ? Me , and it 's really too jumpy by nature to endure much reflection . Therefore , many more of them will be well-informed rather than sagacious This will result in their knowing most things far too soon , at too early a stage of civilization to use them aright . They will learn to make valuable explosives at a stage in their growth when they will use them not only in industries , but for killing brave men . They will devise ways to mine coal efficiently , in enor ? mous amounts , at a stage when they wo n't know enough to conserve it , and will waste their few stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simian habit called " travel . " This will consist in queer lit ? tle hurried runs over the globe , to see ten thousand things in the hope of thus filling their minds . ( Even in a wild state the monkey is restless and does not live in lairs . ) Their minds will he full enough . Their intelligence will be active and keen . It will have a constant tendency , however , to outstrip their wisdom . Their intelli ? gence will hurry them into building great industrial systems before they have the sagacity and judgment to run them aright . They will build greater political empires than they know how to guide . They will quarrel endlessly about which is the best scheme of government with ? out stopping to realize that learning to govern comes first . ( The average simian will imagine he knows without learning . ) The natural result will be industrial and political wars . In a world of un Inventions will come so easily to them ( in comparison with all other creatures ) , and they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mak ? ing inventions , that their many devices will be more of a care than a comfort . In their homes a large part of their time will have to be spent keeping their numerous ingenuities in good working ? order ? their elaborate bell-ringing ar ? rangements , their locks and their clocks . In the field of science , to be sure , this fertility in invention will lead to a long list of important and beautiful discov ? eries ? telescopes and the calculus , radio ? graphs and the spectrum . Discoveries great enough , almost , to make angels of them . But here again their simian-ness will cheat them of half of their dues , for they will neglect great discoveries of the truest importance , and honor extrava ? gantly those of less value and splendor if only they cater especially to simian traits . To consider examples : A discovery that helps them to talk , just to talk , more and more , will be hailed by these beings as one of the highest of triumphs . Talking to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when harnessed and tamed , will be made to trot round , conveying the most trivial cacklings all day and all night . Huge seas of talk in all forms , such as print , speech , and writing , will roll un ? ceasingly over their " civilized " realms , involving an unbelievable waste of labor and time , and sapping the intelligence talk is supposed to upbuild . In a simian civilization great halls will be erected for " lectures , " and great throngs will actu ? ally pay to go in these at night to hear some self-satisfied talk-maker chatter for hours . Almost any subject . will do for a lecture or talk ; yet very few subjects will be counted important enough for the average man to do any thinking on them , off by himself . VOL . CXL. ? No. 838. - 04 Are we or are we not simians ? It is no use for any man to plan or adopt a sys ? tem of ethics until he has decided first of all where he stands on that question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tion , philosophy , what not . In every field of thought two great schools ap ? pear that are divided on this : Must we forever be , at heart , high-grade simians ? Or are we at heart something else ? " Our problem is not to discover what we ought to do if we were different , but what we ought to do , being what we are . There is no end to the beings we can imagine different from ourselves ; but they do not exist , and we can not be sure they would be better than we if they did . For , when we imagine them , we must imagine an entire environment ; we must imagine them as part of a whole reality that does not now exist . And that reality , since it is a figment of our minds , would probably be inferior to the reality that is . For there is this to be said in favor of reality ? that we have nothing to compare ii with . Our fan ? tasies are always incomplete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plete . We can not compare their incom ? pleteness with its completeness . " ' Too many moralists begin with a dis ? like of reality ? a dislike of men as they are . They are free to dislike them ? but not at the same time to be moralists . Their feeling leads them to ignore the obligation which should rest on all teach ? ers , " to discover the best that man can do , not to seL impossibilities before him and tell him that if he does not perform them he is damned . " Man is moldable , very , and it is de ? sirable that he should aspire . But he is apt to be hasty about accepting any and all general ideals without figuring out whether they are suitable for simian use . One result of his habit of swallowing whole most of the ideals that occur to him is that he has swallowed a number that strongly conflict . Any ideal what From an anonymous article entitled " Tolstoy and Russia , " in The London Times , September ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to assimilate ; but when two at once act on us in different ways , it is unbearable . In such a ease , the poets will prefer the ideal that 's idealest ; the hard-headed instinctively choose the one adapted to simians . As a practical matter , every man needs to decide where he stands on this question , before he attempts to make decisions that are really subsidiary . For example , take our methods of edu ? cation . We have , in the main , two great systems . One depends upon discipline , the other on exciting the interest . The teacher who does not recognize or allow for our simian nature keeps little chil ? dren at work for long periods at dull and dry tasks . Without sonic such disci ? pline , he fears that his boys will lack strength . The other system believes they will learn more when their interest is aroused ; and when their minds , which are mobile by nature , are allowed to keep moving . Or in polities : the best government for simians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk-room , where endless vague thoughts can be warmly expressed . This is the natural child of those primeval sessions that gave pleasure to apes . It is neither an ideal nor a rational arrange ? ment , of course . Small executive com ? mittees would be better . But not if we are simians . Or in industry : Why do factory-workers produce more in eight-lion rs a day than in ten ? It is absurd . Super-sheep could not do it . But that is the way men are made . To preach to such beings about the dignity of labor is futile . The dignity of labor is not a simian concep ? tion at all . True simians hate to have to work steadily ; they call it grind and confinement . They are always ready to pity the poor , who are eendemned to this fate , and to congratulate those who escape it , or who can do something else . When they see some performer in span ? gles risk his life at a circus , swinging around on trapezes , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must do itdaily , do they pity him ? No ! Super-elephants would say , and quite properly , " What a horrible life ! " But it seems rather stimulating to simians . Boys envy the fellow On the other hand , . whenever we are told about factory life , we instinctively shudder to think of en ? during such evils . We see some old workman filling cans with a whirring machine , and we hear the humanitarians telling us , indignant and grieving , that he actually must stand in that nice , warm , dry room every day , safe from storms and wild beasts , and with nothing to do but fill cans ; and at once we groan : " How deadly ! What monoto ? nous toil ! Shorten his hours ! " His work would seem blissful to super-spiders ? yet we think it 's intolerable . Grind and confinement ? " That 's the strong mon ? key blood in our veins . Our monkey blood is also apparent in our judgments of crime . If a crime is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because , being simians , with a weakness for yielding to impulses , we like to excuse ourselves by feeling not accountable for them . Elephants would have probably taken an opposite stand . They are n't creatures of impulse , and would be shocked at crimes due to such causes ; their fault is the opposite one of pondering too long over injuries , and becoming vindictive in the end , out of all due proportion . If a young super-elephant were to murder another on impulse , they would consider him a dan ? gerous character and string him right up . But if he could prove that he had long thought of doing it , they would tend to forgive him . " Poor fellow ! He brooded. " they would say . " That 's upsetting to any one . " Whatever we are , it is important that we should all do our best . This is evi ? dently a world where the ruling race must be on its mettle . Our hold on the planet is not absolute . Our descendants may lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut fungus springs up , defies us , and kills all our chestnuts . The boll-weevil very nearly baffles lls . The fly seems unconquerable . Only a strong civilization , when such foes are about , can preserve us . And our present efforts to cope with such beings are fumbling and slow . We have n't the habit . of candidly fac ? ing our precarious status . We do n't pay a respectful attention to our biological history . We blandly and blindly assume that we were " intended " to rule , and that no other outcome could even be considered by nature . But the facts are , of course , that this is a hard and pre ? carious world , where every mistake and infirmity must be paid for in full . " It needs but little imagination to see how great are the probabilities that , after all , man will prove but one more of Nature 's failures , ignominiously to be swept from her work-table , to make way for another venture . " If mankind ever is swept aside as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure he at least will have been ! I felt this with a kind of warm suddenness only to-day , as I finished these &earnings; and drove through the gates of the park . I had been shutting my modern surroundings out of my thoughts so completely , and living as it were in the will world of ages ago , that when I let myself come back suddenly to the twentieth century , and stare at the park and the people , the change was tremendous . All around me were the well-dressed descendants of primitive animals , whizzing about in bright mo ? tors , past tall , spacious buildings . What gifted , energetic achievers they suddenly seemed ! I thought of a photograph I had once seen , of a ship being torpedoed . There it was , the huge , finely made structure , awash in the sea , with tiny black spots hanging on to its sides ? crew and pas ? sengers . The great ship , even while sinking , was so mighty , and those atoms so helpless . Yet , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had planned it and built it and guided its bulk through the waves .

What fairy-story , what tale from the Arabian Nights of the jinns , is a hundredth part as wonderful as this true fairy-story of simians ? And it is so much more heartening , too , than the tales we invent . A universe capable of giving birth to any such accidents is ? blind or not ? a good world to live in , even if not the best .
