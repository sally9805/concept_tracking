About two months ago nearly every newspaper editor in America committed the sin for which ( in the eyes of the profession ) there is no forgiveness . They allowed themselves to be " played for suckers " by a press agent . Harry Reichenbach juggled the names of Otto Kahn and the Green Room Club , and thereby got free publicity for Reigen-columns of it in every paper . Reigen is a play by Schnitzer , a great dramatist , but the point which Reichenbach took pains to " put over " was that it was immoral . How many of the millions who read the " story " knew that it was manufactured news ? Most editors are sorry it happened . Coming so soon after the Chaplin-Negri wedding stunt , it may at least serve to increase editorial caution .
