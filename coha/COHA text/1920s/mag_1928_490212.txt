OF the many invitations we have received for holiday parties , one alone has touched us deeply . The majority of the invitations were perfunctory , some dull . This particular one was neither , for it arrived on a special Christmas letterhead and had what we regard as a distinct bearing on our social progress . It was a note requesting the pleasure of our company at the twenty-second semi-annual outing of the Guarantee Exterminating Company . WHEN we read Henry Ford 's advice to boys  --  not to save money  --  we knew he was getting himself in hot water . He did , too . Alarmed at his heresy , bank presidents wired him for a retraction , and the chief executive of the Boy Scouts called his speech " pernicious doctrine . " Mr. Ford is probably used to having an organization like General Motors against him , but now he 's bucking the Boy Scouts . In his hour of need , we arc happy ? to throw our weight on his side : money is the most stultifying thing there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . There would he no harm in a young boy devoting his time to saving money were it not that it actually produces results ; the first thing the thrifty boy knows he is the proprietor of a large parcel of Long Island and is an old man , giving away dimes . This is a six-per-cent country , and our Boy Scouts should be warned about it  --  the same as about starting forest fires . MHE Ritz is really the hardest place in town to get into on account of its revolving doors which , although golden , are very stiff . They are so stiff only a person of superhuman strength can push them . Even with the help of the doorman they are almost immutable . Effete fool that we arc , we got halfway through the other day and were too exhausted to go on . The doorman was otherwise engaged , and only the timely arrival of a ' very large woman who entered another sector and threw her magnificent bulk into the task , enabled us to gain access to the inn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind such mighty bulwarks ; but whether to effect an exclusiveness or whether , by giving them some exercise , to save the townspeople from complete physical decay , we dare not say . THERE is a line in Philip Barry 's show which we find hard to forget . Linda says : " We 're all swell at seventeen  --  it 's after that that the sickness sets in . " Prahahly we have n't tried very hard to forget the line , and we do n't intend to , at least until after Christmas . The adult state , at any season of the year , is a dull fate for a person who recalls that he was once a child ; and at Christmas time , maturity is inexcusable . In the time of the red berry and the white thought , it is a hard cross to bear . Therefore , you will excuse us if , in the midst of a merriment that is insecurely built of greeting cards and taxi horns and Salvation Army kettles , we seem to go back twenty years and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wobbly sincerity , in the snow of a street in a suburban town . The gas lamp at the corner , as though approving of the holy music , throws a yellow radiance on the serenaders , and the snow sifts softly down into their faces and into the hell of the bass horn . Ever since morning the parlor of the house has been shut off behind two heavy oak doors that arc never closed at any other time of year , and the mere fact that one room in the house has been dedicated to mystery is about as much excitement as the heart can stand . Across the hall from the parlor  --  in what was called the reception room , for a reason that was neither understood nor questioned  --  is the prickly smell of holly , the green smell of fir , the red promise of a paper hell . The front doorbell rings : one of the musicians appears , his horn under an arm . As he stands there , grinning and cold , a little parcel of snow comes whispering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left-hand trouser pocket of the Good Provider . " Merry Christmas ! " he says , and leaves . From the window he can be dimly seen joining the others in front of Billy Den-man 's house . It is time to go to bed and leave the prickly smell , the green smell , and the mystery . The stair landing affords the last perfect view of the hatrack in the hall , on which are ten paper parcels of known content . They contain ten varieties of hard and soft candy , which are to he mixed into a kind of candy punch and introduced with the provision that they must last until New Year 's Day . They will have entirely disappeared , as is well known throughout the household , by the afternoon of the twenty-seventh : the small round chocolate ones with the white trimmings will be gone by the morning of the twenty-sixth . That was twenty years ago . It occurred to us this afternoon that a person essentially does n't change much . Twenty years ago we wanted , above all earthly boons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After considering the thing carefully , we find that that is still what we want ? the only difference being that then , as we went upstairs after a final inspection of the hatrack and looked out from the bedroom window at the whitened roof and the weathervane on top of the barn , there seemed a stronglikelihood that we would get our wish . This year the chances seem very thin . Forecast MHERE is a possibility that taxi- ' . cabs will be electric not long hence . The Edison Company recently sent a man to Yellow Cab to experiment with operating costs of gasoline cars , with the idea of learning whether electrics might not he more economical . We do n't know yet what the results were , but we hear that Yellow is interested . One big factor is that , with traffic gone completely to pieces as it has , most of a cab 's time is spent waiting in traffic jams , not moving  --  and the engine of course is running . Therefore , although a gasoline car is cheaper in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper in the long wait . Another hit of news is that the new Checker cabs , soon to be seen , are going to be even more strangely beautiful than the Paramonnts . Theywill look something like a Lincoln town car that has gone Broadway . Soviet Director HE next European movingpie- tore director to try his luck on the American scene will be S. M. Eisenstein , who made " Potemkin " and the recent " Ten Days That Shook the World . " We have this from an American who visited him last month at his studio in Moscow and who reports that the Russian is eager to work in this country because of the great technical equipment and resources of the American studios . Eisenstein is only thirty , and of smooth-shaven , red-checked , untroubled face . In Russia he makes his pictures under difficulties . His studio is little more than a shed . He made his first picture , " The Strike , " in 1924 in bare surroundings , and it won the first prize in the cinema section of the Paris Exposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " Do you remember the night of the hay ride , when you wore that little white muslin dress ? " came immediately eminent in Europe . The rumor was that he got his actors from the Moscow Art Theatre . Then the startling revelation was made that he had not used professionals at all . He has never yet used professionals . The cast of " Potemkin " was picked up in the streets and factories . The man who played the ship 's surgeon was a fellow the director came upon shovelling coal into the furnace of a hotel in Sebastopol . Eisen-stein prowls into all sorts of places looking for likely characters . The priest in " Potemkin " was a gardener by profession . For a year the Russian has been working on a film dealing with agriculture in Russia which will feature , among other things , a cream separator , a tarantula , a grasshopper , and some flies . When he could n't find the right kind of grasshoppers and flies in Russia , he imported some from this country . This film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one room in Moscow , the space allotted him by the government . He also has a bed on thefloor in one corner of his studio where he takes naps between the shooting of scenes . He frequently labors far into the night . Although he works with the proletariat , he comes from a higher social stratum . His family owned ships and was wealthy , but lost all in the overthrow of the government . The movie director studied engineering in his teens , and during the revolution designed and built fortifications for the Red Army . He spent his spare time about the theatre and eventually became director of various proletarian theatrical groups . Once he directed a play given in a gas house , the employees at their work forming a part of the cast . He took up movies because he thought they gave him wider scope , and has become such a figure that last year Douglas Fairbanks called on him and urged him to come to America . He thinks that German productions , except " Metropolis " and " Faust , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lightly on the subject of art in American movies , preferring to dwell on our superior studios . Quest of the Golden Fish T " glow of Christmas in his heart , a kindly , rotund businessman went into a shop after lunch and bought a bowl of goldfish for his niece . After he had motored toward his office with it , it came to him that making an entrance with a bowl of goldfish would be embarrassing , so he decided to leave the howl somewhere for the afternoon . He selected a garage . In the gloom of a December twilight , when the gentleman returned for his fish , all of the garages on the block looked alike and it was the jolly fellow 's luck to hit first the wrong place . " Did I leave my goldfish here ? " he beamed at a mechanic , a hard , materialistic fellow with no feeling for fantasy . This man thought it was the intelligentsia 's idea of spoofing , and reached for a wrench . The kindly businessman promptly departed , and gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought some more fish . Broadway 11-1arionettes E were asked to a dress rehearsal of the puppet show which had its premiere Sunday at the Little Theatre . The marionettes , more adroitly fashioned than any we ever saw , amused us . The brave plan to establish a permanent puppet-repertory company on Broadway , which will put on plays and revues and , later , political satires after the Continental manner , with such things as a wooden Coolidge and a wooden Jimmy Walker , is appealing because it sounds progressive and irreverent . The rehearsal was staged in an enormous room in an old building in Twenty-third Street , where the puppeteers had been working day and night for weeks . Puppeteers have amazing vitality . Tired , but happy , they put on a complete show for a group of only two or three persons . As the show began a lady at our side turned to us and said , " W0000 . " We moved away slightly . " Do n't mind me , " she said , " I am the Voice in the Pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am also , " she whispered consolingly , " the Bell in the Sea . " Each of the puppeteers is a number of things . One of them handled the strings for a crab , a monkey , and a mouse in one play . We were awed by the men who worked the Yeller Gals  --  a pair of colored dancers  --  for each puppet is controlled by twenty-two strings . Their Ian-guorous swaying dance was a line achievement . Before we left we met the man who designed the puppets , Mr. Robert IIestwood . He is a Californian , as are many of his associates . Hearing that a rehearsal was going forward , he got out of a sick bed to attend . He had fallen ill while working late into the night on a bunch of golly-wogs . He is six feet four inches tall and a sculptor by profession . These are the first marionettes he has designed . The actual manufacturer is a man who makes scientific instruments for the Carnegie laboratories in California . The materials used are wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , temperamental and frequently will not act in certain parts . For instance , there is a cockney woman puppet designed to do a sober character part who refuses , however , to act otherwise than drunk . The skit written for her had to be abandoned . The man who pulls her strings made her go through a few steps for us , and she was plainly as tight as a tick . Fortitude ONE thing we learned this week was that the New York Central every year turns down astonishing offers from concerns that Want to rent advertising space on the little information booth in the main room . People who meet their friends by the clock tiltre are probably quite unaware of the pangs of self-control the railroad suffers in order to keep it a homey little spot , free of slogans . Just the other day a firm offered fifty thousand dollars to be allowed to paste up something or other there . The executive of the Central just smiled quizzically , and despatched another train . Crash Two ! IN connection with our mention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told of an even closer tie-up between food and aviation . When you order fried eggs at The Hying Inn , which occupies an un-painted shack next to the Sikorsky hangar on Curtiss Field , the waiter calls out " Loop two ! " An omelet is called a crash and an order of bread and butter a side-slip . Other dishes and their symbols arc ham and eggs , three-point Landing ; sau-sage , ground-loop ; lamb chop , tail-skid ; and wheat cakes , wing-overs . The Bremen fliers ate at The Flying Inn after their arrival here and Baron von Huenefeld pronounced the coffee " most delicious . " Now only the greenest student asks for a cup of coffee . Those in the know call for a " most delicious . " The German fliers autographed a paper cup for the proprietor , a young lady , and it was proudly on exhibition in the restaurant until some aviation enthusiast purchased it for a thousand dollars . He said he intended to present it to the Smithsonian Institution . Mrs. Claus AREADER has taken us to task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloomingdale 's in our recent piece about that place . It seems that the young man who plays Saint Nicholas said he would come to work only if they would find something for his wife to do too . Bloomingdale 's was in a fix at the moment as they had fired their first Santa Claus because he was too mean to the kids . They asked what the wife could do . " She has a fairy costume and she could be a fairy , " said the husband . This accounts , then , for the unsmiling young woman we saw helping Santa hand out gift boxes to the children . What fooled us was that she did n't have a wand with ft star on it . Tree Farm HE Christmas trees which bloom I in light every December in Washington Square and Times Square are bought from a lady in whom we DECEMBER . 2 2 , , 1928 became interested when someone told us that she sold many trees , but never used to send hills because she thought it was dreadful to take money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . She got over her squeamishness and now is one of the wealthiest tree growers in the world . Her name is Evelyn Smith and her estate is at Amawalk , in Westchester County . If you have motored up there  --  above P ( ) can tico Hills  --  you have driven by her six hundred acres of tree-planted land . A double lane of maples before her house is , in autumn , one of the loveliest sights in the county . Miss Smith inherited her Amawalk , rounds and a love for trees from her father , who was Major Orlando Jay Smith . He collected fine specimens as a hobby . Left with the tree farm on her hands when she was just out of finishing school , Miss Smith hardly knew what to do with it , and used to send .. trees to her father 's friends , who had to urge her to sell them rather than give them away . She finally went into the business seriously and now the trees on her land are valued at seven millions . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by George Washington in Virginia . When she was in Washington some years ago arranging for the shipment of the National Christmas Tree , which every year comes from her place , Miss Smith heard of the Washington tree going on sale and bought it , over the protests of the Daughters of the Confederacy . Many trees in Central Park and along Riverside Drive were supplied by her , and two years ago she flew down here with one of them in Rene Fonck 's plane  --  he planted the tree as a memorial along the Drive . Memorial trees are a specialty with Miss Smith and those set out here , in Washington , and elsewhere , by the Prince of NVales , Marshal Foch , the Queen of the Belgians , and most other visiting celebrities , came from her farm . The Rockefellers and Fords are customers . Most people with estates now have n't the patience to wait for saplings to mature . They want full-grown trees at once  --  thirty or forty feet or thereabouts . The transplanting of big trees was a problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out , for instance , a scheme of building an underground barrier about the base of a tree , thus confining the roots so THE NEW YORKER that they can he dug up easily . She even invented special machinery for the digging . Improvement de Luxe MUCH , much appears to lie behind the suggestion to build the new Metropolitan Opera House in the block between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and Forty-ninth and Fiftieth Streets . The idea is only a detail in a romantic and spectacular real-estate deal now seemingly on the verge of completion , perhaps the biggest in the city 's history . It involves the sale by Columbia University to John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , of practically the whole of the three city blocks bounded by Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue , Forty-eighth Street and Fifty-first Street , the demolition of all the scores of assorted buildings now on the land , and the erection of a whole flock of new ones , modern and big  --  hotels , office buildings , apartment houses , stores , and what not . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is announced to the daily press between the time this item is written and the time it is read . The whole project has crept quietly along in its stocking feet , parties to the deal being pretty mysterious , the university authorities even denying that they intend to sell the centre block  --  Forty-ninth to Fiftieth Streets  --  for the opera house site . That detail , however , is already a fait accompli , we arc told ; and Mr. Rockefeller , who has become active in real estate in recent years , has for a long time been toying with his elaborate plans for the entire area . The whole business will be grouped about the opera house in the centre , according to the plan . The Opera itself is , of course , to be mag , - nificent , with a sort esplanade facing Fifth Avenue , and probably two new streets will he cut through parallel to Fifth and Sixth Avenues . One of these will lead from Forty-eighth , midway between Fifth and Sixth , up to the Forty-ninth Street entrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street entrance on to Fifty-first Street . The other street will be cut straight through , nearer to Sixth Avenue . The idea is that these streets , free of through traffic and offering comfortable space for automobile parking , will become the finest shopping streets in the world , superior to Bond Street , or the Rue de la Paix , or our own Fifth Avenue . Cis/1u o-LuE came into possession of this great tract of land nearly a hundred years ago . In those days when the city was n't as moral as it is now it was the custom of the state to help colleges in their fund-gathering by granting them the privilege of conducting lotteries . In Columbia 's case , however , the state gave this land in lieu of a lottery permit . It is on record that Columbia was n't satisfied at the time ; but for years and years the property has been turning millions in to the university and now its value is so great that only one of Rockefeller 's fortune and credit could think of buying it . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this magnificence will be certain speakeasy proprietors who have slyly and cozily set themselves up in the brownstones , doing their surreptitious bit toward the higher education by the payment of rentals . Still , they have been lucky to hold on for so long , for if anyone at Columbia knew about their existence they would most certainly he ousted . Two years ago the university was made defendant in a padlock action in connection with a building it owns in Coenties Slip , and immediately the tenants were dispossessed . Probably Not Pr HE clerk in a teen 's shop ( so it is alleged ) brought to a young wife , looking up Christmas pajamas for her husband , a pair of silk ones priced at twenty-eight dollars and fifty cents . The lady declared that they were too costly . " Ah , but madam , " said the clerk persuasively , " you wo n't see three pajamas on every man in town . "
