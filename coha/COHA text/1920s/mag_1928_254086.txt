Swinging lazily through the Western air , Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh made a landing at San Diego . Here he was informed of the most extraordinary thing which has happened to him since he landed in Paris . An Amarillo , Tex. , newspaper editor , one Gene Howe , son of famed Atchison ( Kan . ) Daily Globe 's Ed Howe , had called Charles A. Lindbergh " swell-headed . " Lindbergh said : " . . . if I have the swelled-head my hatter has not noticed it . " <P> The Arlenesque suavity of this reference to his " hatter , " was offset by the perceptive wit of the Colonel 's other comments : " It is time the public started land-sliding . It surprises me that they did n't start sooner . If this is the beginning of the end , I am more or less ready for it . However , these adverse comments wo n't take away my appetite . All I ask is that they do n't take away the air I fly through . I 'll take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindbergh for not landing on a field crowded with eager spectators . Despite threatening and sneering telegrams the obscure editor wrote another ironic column : " I 'll grant that he has the courage , but I also insist that he is more or less simpleminded , or he would not have permitted his head to grow to such large proportions . It may be treason for me to say so , but the truth is that Lindbergh has had more extraordinary luck than anyone in modern history . "
