txt TARIFF AND PRICES Others Besides Farmers Would Seem to Need Relief . To the Editor of The New York Timee : Many of us besides the farmers are engaged in unprotected occupations and can justly complain that the laws which compel us to contribute to the support of protected industries are unjust and in violation of the principle that we all are entitled to equal rights . A neighbor of mine bought cloth made In England , and his bill came itemized : For cloth , $25 ; for Customs duties , $13 ; total , $43 . He had to pay a penalty of $18 for buying cloth not made in the United States , and the Government got the money . But this penalty for buying foreign cloth is not levied to get money for the Government . It is levied to enable the American cloth maker to raise the price of his cloth . He can charge the foreign price plus the duties and collect the penalty himself . The same is true of all laws granting protective duties . They practically empower the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These laws certainly violate the principle that all men have equal rights . The millions of us , including the farmers , engaged in unprotected occupations have not equal rights with the protected interests to whose profits the law compels us to contribute . One of the measures to secure equal rights to all was to abolish the oppressive privileges of the aristocrats . The aristocrats , like our protected interests , could enforce contributions from the common people . Every law which favors any special interest creates an inequality of rights among our citizens . It grants to the party favored by the law the oppressive privilege of exacting contributions from his fellow-countrymen . It is sufficient reason , then , for condemning all such laws because they violate the principle that all men are entitled to equal rights . HENRY T. SCUDDER .
