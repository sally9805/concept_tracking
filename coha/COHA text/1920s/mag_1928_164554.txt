Round Russian peasant tummies now contain almost twice as much bread and liquor made from grain as in Tsarist days . So said , last week , both kindly Soviet President Michael Kalinin and ruthless Soviet Dictator Josef Stalin . <P> Reasons for Alarm . Production of grain in the Soviet Union is now almost up to the pre-Revolutionary level , yet there is an acute shortage of grain in the cities , and so little is left for export that that figure now stands at less than one twentieth of the 10,000,000 tons exported in average Romanov years . <P> Explanation may lie in the fact that Tsarist landlords underfed their peasants and sold abroad what the hungry would have liked to eat . Today , with the peasant master of his Fate and Farm , rural tummies are full to bursting , and urban workers are experiencing a slight vacancy under the belt . <P> Most alarming from the Soviet State 's point of view is the loss to Russia of the immense revenue formerly incoming from foreign buyers of grain . <P> Remedies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some people are drawing that inference . . . . We must remedy the situation ! After ten years of our present policy we have reached a point where we must realize that the shortage of grain for urban or export consumption is not the result of accident or poor crops . " <P> " I can see but one way out . We must organize the poor and other citizens into farming groups , which can supplant the function of the former bourgeois landlords in producing an exportable surplus of grain . " <P> Dictator Stalin , scorning to toy even rhetorically with such questions as " Shall we turn back ? " outlined a forward looking four-year program . Keynotes : 1 ) Larger importations of tractors and farm machinery ; 2 ) Devotion of huge State grain farms to the sole purpose of producing an exportable surplus ; 3 ) Education of the peasants to rotate crops and produce a surplus even above full-to-bursting tummy needs ; 4 ) Speeding up of production by urban workers of goods desired by the peasants but not yet available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canny husbandmen into raising and selling a surplus .
