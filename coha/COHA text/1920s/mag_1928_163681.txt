Casting about for likely members of the M Club of Cornell University , Walter Clark Teagle , president of the Standard Oil Co. , of New Jersey , hit upon the name of his rich classmate , Hayward Kendall , Cleveland coalman , and wrote him a letter . It is easy to become a member of the M Club-simply agree to contribute $1,000 annually to Cornell University . But Classmate Kendall did not want to join ; and he said so in a wide open letter to President Livingston Farrand of Cornell . The letter in part : <P> <P> " Even with the will I could n't help comfortably while paying for a winter home in Florida out of income . And by a home in Florida I do n't mean a duchy or principality with a kingly villa in the centre , like the Great Khan Teagle 's estate , but a few humble acres on the Gulf and a simple cottage with bougainvillea and cocoanut palms and poison ivy around it . <P> " My friends speak of a heritage I have gotten from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received from that institution of learning was the licker habit . It took me years to get over it . And , quite frankly , I could have acquired the same habit in two years at Harvard , while it took me four at Cornell . . . . <P> " I refuse to get steamed up over Cornell . You have neither an Eastern university nor a frankly Western one . All you have is a group of rather inharmonious buildings in a glorious setting , a silly , undemocratic , un-Christian fraternity system and a large mass of unwelcome , misplaced women called coeds . . . . <P> " And who can get the date of the Norman invasion or the French irregular verbs fixed in his mind when a bare-kneed cutie , all scented up with Black Narcissus , is sitting just across the aisle ? No one without the sales resistance of a Galahad ! . . . <P> " I refuse to contribute a dime to your present misfit university with its caste system and sexy characteristics . But to show you I am acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million dollars if the fraternity and club system is completely abolished and the women students are given a separate college of their own . . . . <P> " Pardon my rough and tumble entrance to your party . But a brick through the window arouses quicker interest than a dollar 's worth of pansies laid lovingly on the threshold . " <P> This was not a sour grapes letter , for Mr. Kendall as a Cornell undergraduate ( class of 1898 ) was taken into Delta Kappa Epsilon and was managing editor of the Cornell Widow ( funny ) .
