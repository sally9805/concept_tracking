Nothing so testifies to the enlightened literacy of U. S. citizens as the fact that the great mass of them have , at one time or another , read the Saturday Evening Post . Many internationally smart U. S. citizens are proud of the world 's most widely read magazine ; but in London they must sometimes apologize and sometimes blush for the Post 's chronic misuse of British titles and excruciating presentations of the habits and customs of butlers , footmen , peers , peeresses . <P> Last week the newspaper of world 's largest circulation , the London Daily Mail , helpfully advised as follows : <P> " Some of these American magazines really ought to hire a butler to keep them straight on the question of English titles . <P> " In the current number of the Saturday Evening Post there is a story about , the ' Marquis of Benham ' who has an unmarried sister by the name of ' Lady Stanwick ' and a daughter entitled ' the Honourable Alicia . ' . . . <P> " If Lady Stanwick had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could not have had a brother . If her brother is a marquis , though , she can not be Lady Stanwick . She would be Lady Mary Benham ( if that is supposed to be the family name ) . And the daughter could not be the Hon. Alicia . She would , of course , be Lady Alicia . " <P> Embarrassed citizens of the U. S. hoped that Satevepost Owner Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis , who has a butler , will send him buttling ' round to Satevepost Editor George Horace Lorimer whose butler , if any , was thus shamefully exposed .
