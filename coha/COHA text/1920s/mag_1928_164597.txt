Riding forth in a shiny automobile on Independence Day went Vice President Charles Gates Dawes . It was in his own home town of Evanston , Ill . It was a parade . Beside Mr. Dawes in the front motor sat Evanston 's Mayor Charles H. Bartlett . Each was going to make a patriotic speech . There was a holiday atmosphere in the air . The parade was following them . There would be a crowd at the gathering place in an Evanston park . The dignitaries paid small attention to passing motors full of citizens with golf clubs , bathing suits , pop bottles , eyeshades , shirt sleeves . It was Independence Day . They were going to make speeches . <P> But at the park , the parade behind the Vice-Presidential motor proved to be incredibly small . All told the audience that assembled numbered scarcely 200 . The Evanstonians had , apparently , slipped off golfing , bathing , picknicking , rubbernecking that day , or were all sleeping late . The Vice President was vexed , and Mayor Bartlett , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' stand without a syllable , drove home .
