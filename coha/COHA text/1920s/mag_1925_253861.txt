In Prague , the International Music Festival was held , the latest developments of modern European music were presented to congeries of the cognoscenti . <P> Das Kluge Fuchslein ( The Sly Little Fox ) , an opera by Leos Jancek is , in technique , the exact opposite of Jenufa ( TIME , Dec. 15 ) , his first opera , written 25 years ago . Jenufa was realism-a Czech Wirklichkeit ; this work is phantasy . It tells the story of a fox-no histrionic creature , in whose caperings those of humanity are derisively reflected , but a sharp red beast out of the fen . Captured by a woodcutter , he bites a baby , kills a cock , runs away to the woods again . Meanwhile , one Terynka-a girl as pretty , wild , red , sly ' , as the little fox-has been misled by a rogue who , meeting the fox in the woods , destroys him also . Thus Jancek , now 70 , at once the oldest and the most vital of all Czech composers , has turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professed to consider beasts and birds as significant apart from their usefulness as marionettes of satire . <P> Half Time by Bohuslav Martinu seems to mirror in sound the delirium of a football game-bass-drum drop-kicks cannonading , harmonies lining stiffly against each other , breaking , at a signal , into isolated , screaming units . Critics , adopting this theory , compared it favorably to Honegger 's Pacific 231 ( TIME , Oct. 27 ) . Said Martinu : " As the composer , I beg to state that Half Time is not a sport composition . . . it registers no football game , no whistle of umpire or protests of the crowd . . . . The problem is one of rhythm and construction . . . a reaction against impressionism . . . . " <P> Toman and die Waldfec , by Vitezslav Novak , embodies the old German folk story of Toman who , betrayed by his beloved , can not resist the decoy of the sidelong smiling fairy whose kiss is death . He rides to his bride in a ballad for strings with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his laughter whirls in the brasses ; exhaustion succeeds ; the love cry faints into the sliding enchantments of Venus Yertocordia , to culminate at length in a triumphant orgy of brutal discords . " The finale , " said one critic , " is like awakening from a nightmare . "
