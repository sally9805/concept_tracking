The Senators bore each other so much of the time that the few humorists among them find it easy to raise a laugh , once they put their minds to it . Last week , Matthew Mansfield Neely , the handsome senior Senator from West Virginia , put his mind on Candidate Hoover 's reply to Senator Borah 's questionnaire on Prohibition ( TIME , March 5 ) and spoke for the space of four columns in the Congressional Record . So successfully did this speech go off that , afterwards , Senator Neely felt justified in editing the parenthesis Laughter into the Congressional Record no less than 13 times . <P> Some Neelyisms : <P> " Mr. President , Mr. Hoover in this letter to Senator Borah reaches the sublimest height of epistolary humbuggery ever attained by man . Laughter . " <P> " When Mr. Hoover dictated this meaningless epistle he was evidently as irritable and belligerent as Thrasymachus was when , because of his inability to answer questions propounded by Socrates , he ill-naturedly accused the great philosopher of having ' a stuffed nose ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency demanded . Laughter . " <P> " He Mr. Hoover is more exasperatingly evasive than the wicked wag whose sobbing young wife , when asked the cause of her grief , replied : ' Every time I asked my husband if he likes my biscuits he tells me that I have beautiful eyes . ' Laughter . " <P> " Let Mr. Borah add : ' Herbert , so far you have ignored this question . If you do not immediately answer it " yes " or " no , " the righteous wrath of vast multitudes of voters will wax hot against you and , like a great conflagration , consume you and your vaulting ambition on the floor of the Kansas City convention . ' Laughter . " <P> " Mr. Hoover has spoken , or , rather , written ' into the air . ' His trumpet has given an uncertain sound , a mere ambiguous squeak . Laughter . " <P> " To Mr. Hoover 's effort to obtain a political delegation from the Vice President 's Blue Heaven let us be as indifferent as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a panther was fighting his mother-in-law , retorted , ' Why should I care what happens to a panther ? ' Laughter . " <P> " An appropriate epitaph for Mr. Hoover at the conclusion of his race in the State of Illinois : <P> " Here lies the body of Mary Ann Proctor , <P> " Who caught a cold and refused to doctor ; <P> " She could not stay , she had to go- <P> " Praise God from whom all blessings flow . Laughter. "
