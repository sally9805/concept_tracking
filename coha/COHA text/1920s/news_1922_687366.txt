txt The two American members of the Sacred College , Cardinals O'Connell of Boston and Dougherty of Philadeli phia , will leave at the earliest possible moment to attend the conclave for the election of a successor to Pope- Benedict , it was said in ecclesiastical circles tonight . Cardinal O'Connell failed to secure passage yesterday , as he had planned , and will sail tomorrow on the Presidente Wilson . Cardinal Dougherty is expected to return from a vacation trip next Friday , and probably will sail on the following day on the French liner La Lorraine . If there is no especial reason for delay , it was said here , the conclave may meet Feb. 1 . The fear was expressed that if the conclave was as short as that which resulted in the election of the late Pontiff , both the American members of the Sacred College might arrive in Rome too late to participate in the election .

Strong Ties With Gasparri . Cardinal Pietro Gasparri , Papal Secretary of State and " Chamlerlain of the Holy Roman Church , " is being spoken of here as a possible successor to the seat of St. Peter . By virtue of his position Cardinal Gasparri has been in charge of the papal household and of affairs at the Vatican since 6 o'clock this morning . He is expected to carry out the late Pope 's plans with complete fidelity . With the exception of the first thirty-seven days after his election , when Benedict XV . had as Secretary of State Cardinal Domenicci Ferrata , who died on Oct. 10 , 1914 , Cardinal Gasparri has uninterruptedly occupied the position of Secretary of State . Persons familiar with the facts have commented on the warm cordiality and affection of the Pope toward his Secretary of State , and the devotion and affection of the latter toward the Pope .

The Pope used to sit at the bedside of his Chamberlain , inform him of what was going on , consult with him on important affairs and discuss with him the attitude of the Holy See on the most momentous questions . No greater intimacy , no more complete identity of views and of feelings , it is said , can be imagined than that between 113enddict and Gasparri . The Pope was small of stature and very frail , while Gasparri is above medium height " and rather stout . They ' were both indefatigable workers , who could go on without ceasing from 5 o'clock in the morning , when they arose , until late at night . They succeeded in tiring younger prelates who ' Worked under them , including Mgr . Tedeschini and Mgr .

The plenum of the Sacred College , or its authorized maximum membership , can not surpais seventy , but now the Cardinals number only sixtyone , of whom thirty-one are Italians and thirty foreigners . There , are only six Cardinal Bishops , to whom are entrusted the six dioceses immediately around Rome . Their dean is Cardinal Vicenzio Vannutelli , who visited the United States about ' ten years ago , when Pius X. sent him as Papal Legate to the Eucharistic Congress in Montreal . At that time the report circulated that his npehew , Count Galileo Vannutelli , would marry a Catholic American girl of Philadelphia ; but later he married a French girl . Cardnial Vannutelli is not only the dean of the Cardinal Bishops , but since the death of Cardinal Gibbons he is also , the dean of the entire Sacred College . having been raised to the purple by Leo XIII . thirty-three years ago .

An unwritten rule prohibits cardinals walking inside the city of Rome , so much go that all the wearers of the purple every day motor or drive outside the walls of the city to be able to take their constitutionals . Cardinal Vannutelli did not observe the rule and after sunset dressed as a simple priest , could be seen along the narrow lanes flanking the Farnese Palace or the Palace of the Cancelleria .

Cardinal Gasparri , according to the general opinion , has the greatest chance of success , but an old Roman proverb says that " he who enters the conclave as Pope comes out ' of it as Cardinal . " This was borne out in the last three conclaves , when Leo XIII. , Pius X. and Benedict XV . were elected contrary to the expectation of the majority .
