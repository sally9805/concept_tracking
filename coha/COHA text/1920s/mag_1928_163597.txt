One of England 's mellowest legends concerns a Countess of Salisbury who found her garter slipping , in the merry , ardent days of Edward III ( 1312-77 ) . Down and down slipped the garter until it tumbled before the knowing eyes of a pack of smirking courtiers . But Edward III , with instant chivalry , stooped , retrieved the ribbon , tied it just below his own royal knee , and exclaimed to the Courtiers in immortal reproof : " Honi soit qui mal y pense ! " ( Evil be to him who evil thinks ! ) . <P> Soon no knightly honor was so prized as membership in the " Society of the Garter , " founded by Edward III , circa 1347 . Today King-Emperor George V presides over what is now the " Most Noble Order of the Garter ; " and last week His Majesty appointed with great pomp three new Garter-Knights . <P> First is Alexander Augustus Frederick William Alfred George Cambridge , 54 , Earl of Athlone , a brother of Queen-Empress Mary , and since 1923 His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All his life he has been a soldier-a smart Hussar , an impeccable Life Guard , and finally , during the South <P> African and World Wars , a conscientious officer several times cited in despatches . The great honor done him , last week , may perhaps in some small measure distract his grief at the death of his son , Viscount Trematon , recently killed in a motor accident ( TIME , April 23 ) . <P> Gossips remember that the Earl of Athlone subsisted for years as a " poor relation " of British Royalty . Edward VII disliked him and was niggardly about allowing him to live rent-free in a mean suite of rooms at Windsor Castle . Not until his sister became Queen-Empress did his future really brighten . At present his duty is merely to preside impartially , in the Union of South Africa , over the incessant squabbles of the factions headed by Prime Minister James Barry Munnik Hertzog and famed General Jan Christiaan Smuts . <P> Second of the new Garter-Knights is James Albert Edward Hamilton , 58 , Duke of Abercorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous service as the Governor of Northern Ireland since the troublous times of 1922 . <P> Lastly , His Majesty bestowed a blue garter worked with gold , upon William Henry Grenfell , 72 , Baron Desborough , now president of the British Imperial Council of Commerce , but in his day a famed climber of the Alps and U. S. Rocky Mountains and a swimmer of such prowess that he twice breasted the Niagara River. * <P> <P> *Not to be confused with Dr. Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell , Master Mariner , first medical of the missionary to Labrador and now Superintendent of the International Grenfell Association operating hospitals , stores , orphanages , schools for fisherman of the far north .
