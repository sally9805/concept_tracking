Peers of the Realm ' were mightily stirred , last week , when the House of Commons sent to the House of Lords a bill providing that county councils " shall be empowered to enter and reduce rabbits upon land adjoining cultivation , " if the cultivator shall have complained of damage from the rabbits . <P> Clearly this measure would subvert a very foundation stone of aristocracy . If the rabbits of a duke are to be " reduced " upon mere complaint by an adjacent farmer , the sanctity of dukedoms totters in the balance . <P> Therefore when " that bloody rabbit bill ! " came up , last week , landed and rusticating Peers bustled up to London , to defend the right of rabbits to be reduced only by authentic sportsmen . <P> A long and bitter debate ensued . The Marquess of Salisbury , speaking for His Majesty 's Government , earnestly besought Their Lordships not to oppose a bill which Conservative farmers had been promised by Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , himself a landed country squire and rabbit owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabbit bill " was found to have been defeated by two votes . It will , of course . become law over the heads of Their Lordships if passed three times by the House of Commons . Stupefied clerks of the House of Lords said , last week , that this was the first bill introduced by a Conservative Government to be defeated by Their Lordships in 80 years .
