Scene : Sitting-room of the Morton 's farmhouse in the middle west  --  on the rolling prairie just back from the Mississippi . A room that has been long and comfortably lived in , and showing that first-hand contact with materials which was pioneer life . The hospitable table was made on the place  --  well and strongly made ; there are braided rugs , and the wooden chairs have patchwork cushions . There is a corner closet  --  left rear . A picture of Abraham Lincoln . On the floor a home-made toy boat . At rise of curtain there are on the stage an old woman and a young man . Grandmother Morton is in her rocking-chair near the open door , facing left . On both sides of door are windows , looking out on a generous land . She has a sewing basket and is patching a boy 's pants . She is very old . Her hands tremble . Her spirit remembers the days of her strength . Smith has just come in and , hat in hand , is standing by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon of Fourth of July . SMITH But the celebration was over two hours ago . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Oh , celebration , that 's just the beginning of it . Might as well set down . When them boys that fought together all get in one square  --  they have to swap stories all over again . That 's the worst of a war  --  you have to go on hearing about it so long . Here it is  --  1879  --  and we have n't taken Gettysburg yet . Well , it was the same way with the war of 1832. p. 3 SMITH Who is now seated at the table . The war of 1832 ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON News to you that we had a war with the Indians ? SMITH That 's right  --  the Blackhawk war . I 've heard of it . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Heard of it ! SMITH Were your men in that war ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON I was in that war . I threw an Indian in the cellar and stood on the door . I was heavier then . SMITH Those were stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . This war  --  Lincoln 's war  --  it 's all a cut and dried business now . We used to fight with anything we could lay hands on  --  dish water  --  whatever was handy . SMITH I guess you believe the saying that the only good Indian is a dead Indian . GRANDMOTHER MORTON I du n no . We roiled them up considerable . They was mostly friendly when let be . Did n't want to give up their land  --  but I 've noticed something of the same nature in white folks . SMITH Your son has  --  something of that nature , has n't he ? p. 4 GRANDMOTHER MORTON He 's not keen to sell . Why should he ? It 'll never be worth less . SMITH But since he has more land than any man can use , and if he gets his price  --  GRANDMOTHER MORTON That what you 've come to talk to him about ? SMITH I  --  yes . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well , you 're not the first . Many a man older than you has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try a young one . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Some one that knew him thought that up . Silas 'd help a young one if he could . What is it you 're set on buying ? SMITH Oh , I do n't know that we 're set on buying anything . If we could have the hill Looking off to the right at a fair price  --  GRANDMOTHER MORTON The hill above the town ? Silas 'd rather sell me and the cat . SMITH But what 's he going to do with it ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Maybe he 's going to climb it once a week . SMITH But if the development of the town demands its use  --  p. 5 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Smiling . You the development of the town ? SMITH I represent it . This town has been growing so fast  --  GRANDMOTHER MORTON This town began to grow the day I got here . SMITH You  --  you began it ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON My husband and I began it  --  and our baby Silas . SMITH When was that ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON 1820 , that was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON No , we were n't alone . We had the Owens ten miles down the river . SMITH But how did you get here ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Got here in a wagon , how do you s'pose ? Gayly Think we flew ? SMITH But was n't it unsafe ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Them set on safety staid back in Ohio . SMITH But one family ! I should think the Indians would have wiped you out . p. 6 GRANDMOTHER MORTON The way they wiped us out was to bring fish and corn . We 'd have starved to death that first winter had n't been for the Indians . SMITH But if they were such good neighbors  --  why did you throw dish water at them ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON That was after other white folks had roiled them up  --  white folks that did n't know how to treat ' em . This very land  --  land you want to buy  --  was the land they loved  --  Blackhawk and his Indians . They came here for their games . This was where their fathers  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen my husband and Blackhawk climb that hill together . A backward point right . He used to love that hill  --  Blackhawk . He talked how the red man and the white man could live together . But poor old Blackhawk  --  what he did n't know was how many white man there was . After the war  --  when he was beaten but not conquered in his heart  --  they took him east  --  Washington , Philadelphia , New York  --  and when he saw the white man 's cities  --  it was a different Indian came back . He just let his heart break without ever turning a hand . SMITH But we paid them for their lands . She looks at him . Paid them something . p. 7 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Something . For fifteen million acres of this Mississippi Valley land  --  best on this globe , we paid two thousand two hundred and thirty-four dollars and fifty cents , and promised to deliver annually goods to the value of one thousand dollars . Not a fancy price  --  even for them days . Children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door , left . Ira ! Let that cat be ! SMITH Looking from the window . These , I suppose , are your grandchildren ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON The boy 's my grandson . The little girl is Madeline Fejevary  --  Mr. Fejevary 's youngest child . SMITH The Fejevary place adjoins on this side ? Pointing right , down . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Yes . We 've been neighbors ever since the Fejevarys came here from Hungary after 1848 . He was a count at home  --  and he 's a man of learning . But he was a refugee because he fought for freedom in his country . Nothing Silas could do for him was too good . Silas sets great store by learning  --  and freedom . SMITH Thinking of his own project , looking off toward the hill  --  the hill is not seen from the front . I suppose then Mr. Fejevary has great influence with your son ? p. 8 GRANDMOTHER MORTON More ' an anybody . Silas thinks ' t was a great thing for our family to have a family like theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we 've had no time for the things their family was brought up in . Old Mrs. Fejevary with her shrewd smile  --  she were n't stuck up  --  but she did have an awful ladylike way of feeding the chickens . Silas thinks  --  oh my son has all kinds of notions  --  though a harder worker never found his bed at night . SMITH And Mr. Fejevary  --  is he a veteran too ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Dryly . You do n't seem to know these parts well  --  for one that 's all stirred up about the development of the town . Yes  --  Felix Fejevary and Silas Morton went off together , down that road motioning with her hand , right  --  when them of their age was wanted . Fejevary came back with one arm less than he went with . Silas brought home everything he took  --  and something he did n't . Rheumatiz . So now they set more store by each other ' an ever . Seems nothing draws men together like killing other men . A boy 's voice teasingly imitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . A whoop from the girl  --  a boy 's whoop . Looking . There they go , off for the creek . If they set in it  --  Seems about to call after them , gives this up . Well , they 're not the first . Rather dreams over this . p. 9 SMITH You must feel as if you pretty near owned this country . GRANDMOTHER MORTON We worked . A country do n't make itself . When the sun was up we were up , and when the sun went down we did n't . As if this renews the self of those days . Here  --  let me set out something for you to eat . Gets up with difficulty . SMITH Oh , no , please  --  never mind . I had something in town before I came out . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Du n no as that 's any reason you should n't have something here . She goes off , right ; he stands at the door , looking toward the hill until she returns with a glass of milk , a plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRANDMOTHER MORTON I 've fed a lot of folks  --  take it by and large . I did n't care how many I had to feed in the daytime  --  what 's ten or fifteen more when you 're up and around . But to get up  --  after sixteen hours on your feet  --  I was willin ' , but my bones complained some . SMITH But did you  --  keep a tavern ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Keep a tavern ? I guess we did . Every house is a tavern when houses are sparse . You think the way to settle a country is to go on ahead and build hotels ? That 's all you folks know . Why , I never went to bed without leaving something on the stove for the new ones that might be coming . And we never went away from home without seein ' there was aplenty for them that might stop . p. 10 SMITH They 'd come right in and take your food ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON What else could they do ? There was a woman I always wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before  --  and left aplenty for our supper when we got back with the ducks and berries . And she left the kitchen handier than it had ever been . I often wondered about her  --  where she came from , and where she went . As she dreams over this there is laughing and talking at the side of the house . There come the boys . Mr. Fejevary comes in , followed by Silas Morton . They are men not far from sixty , wearing their army uniforms , carrying the muskets they used in the parade . Fejevary has a lean , distinguished face , his dark eyes are penetrating and rather wistful . The left sleeve of his old uniform is empty . Silas Morton is a strong man who has borne the burden of the land , and not for himself alone  --  the pioneer . Seeing the stranger , he sets his musket against the wall and holds out his hand to him , as Mr. Fejevary goes up to Grandmother Morton . SILAS How'do , stranger ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And how are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not abed  --  and do n't expect to be . p. 11 SILAS Letting go one of the balloons he has bought . Where 's Ira ? And Madeline ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Mr. Fejevary 's Delia brought them home with her . They 've gone down to dam the creek , I guess . This young man 's been waiting to see you , Silas . SMITH Yes , I wanted to have a little talk with you . SILAS Well , why not ? He is tying the gay balloons to his gun , then as he talks , hangs his hat in the corner closet . We 've been having a little talk ourselves . Mother , Nat Rice was there . I 've not seen Nat Rice since the day we had to leave him on the road with his torn leg  --  him cursing like a pirate . I wanted to bring him home , but he had to go back to Chicago . His wife 's dead , mother . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well , I guess she 's not sorry . SILAS Why , mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mean , stingy , complaining man  --  his leg notwithstanding . Where 'd you leave the folks ? SILAS Oh  --  scattered around . Everybody visitin ' with anybody that 'll visit with them . Wish you could have gone . p. 12 GRANDMOTHER MORTON I 've heard it all . To Fejevary . Your folks well ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST All well , Mrs. Morton . And my boy Felix is home . He 'll stop in here to see you by and by . SILAS Oh , he 's a fine looking boy , mother . And think of what he knows ! Cordially including the young man . Mr. Fejevary 's son has been to Harvard College . SMITH Well , well  --  quite a trip . Well , Mr. Morton , I hope this is not a bad time for me to  --  present a little matter to you ? SILAS Genially . That depends , of course , on what you 're going to present . Attracted by a sound outside . Mind if I present a little matter to your horse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite o ' grass . SMITH Why  --  yes . I suppose he would like that . SILAS Going out . You bet he 'd like it . Would n't you , old boy ? SMITH Your son is fond of animals . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Lots of people 's fond of ' em  --  and good to ' em . Silas  --  I du n no , it 's as if he was that animal . p. 13 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He has imagination . GRANDMOTHER MORTON With surprise . Think so ? SILAS Returning and sitting down at the table by the young man . Now , what 's in your mind , my boy ? SMITH This town is growing very fast , Mr. Morton . SILAS Yes . Slyly  --  with humor . I know that . SMITH I presume you , as one of the early settlers  --  as in fact a son of the earliest settler , feel a certain responsibility about the welfare of  --  SILAS I have n't got it in mind to do the town a bit of harm . So  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . And homes must be in the healthiest places  --  the  --  the most beautiful places . Is n't it true , Mr. Fejevary , that it means a great deal to people to have a beautiful outlook from their homes ? A  --  well , an expanse . SILAS What is it they want to buy  --  these fellows that are figuring on making something out of  --  expanse ? A gesture for expanse , then a reassuring gesture . It 's all right , but  --  just what is it ? p. 14 SMITH I am prepared to make you an offer  --  a gilt-edged offer for that pointing toward it hill above the town . SILAS Shaking his head  --  with the smile of the strong man who is a dreamer . The hill is not for sale . SMITH But would n't you consider a  --  particularly good offer , Mr. Morton ? Silas , who has turned so he can look out at the hill , slowly shakes his head . SMITH Do you quite feel you have the right  --  the moral right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm holding it . SMITH Oh ,  --  for the children ? SILAS Yes , the children . SMITH But  --  if you 'll excuse me  --  there are other investments might do the children even more good . SILAS This seems to me  --  the best investment . SMITH But after all there are other people 's children to consider . SILAS Yes , I know . That 's it . p. 15 SMITH I wonder if I understand you , Mr. Morton ? SILAS Kindly . I do n't believe you do . I do n't see how you could . And I ca n't explain myself just now . So  --  the hill is not for sale . I 'm not making anybody homeless . There 's land enough for all  --  all sides round . But the hill  --  SMITH Rising . Is yours . SILAS You 'll see . SMITH I am prepared to offer you  --  SILAS You 're not prepared to offer me anything I 'd consider alongside what I am considering . So  --  I wish you good luck in your business undertakings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the town . SILAS Do n't sit up nights worrying about my chokin ' the town . SMITH We could make you a rich man , Mr. Morton . Do you think what you have in mind will make you so much richer ? SILAS Much richer . SMITH Well , good-bye . Good day , sir . Good day , ma'am . SILAS Following him to the door . Nice horse you 've got . p. 16 SMITH Yes , seems all right . Silas stands in the doorway and looks off at the hill . GRANDMOTHER MORTON What are you going to do with the hill , Silas ? SILAS After I get a little glass of wine  --  to celebrate Felix and me being here instead of farther south  --  I 'd like to tell you what I want for the hill . To Fejevary rather bashfully . I 've been wanting to tell you . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I want to know . SILAS Getting the wine from the closet . Just a little something to show our gratitude with . Goes off right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it 'd be better to sell the hill  --  while they 're anxious . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He seems to have another plan for it . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Yes . Well , I hope the other plan does bring him something . Silas has worked  --  all the days of his life . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I know . GRANDMOTHER MORTON You do n't know the hull of it . But I know . Rather to herself . Know too well to think about it . p. 17 GRANDMOTHER MORTON As Silas returns . I 'll get more cookies . SILAS I 'll get them , mother . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Get ' em myself . Pity if a woman ca n't set out her own cookies . SILAS Seeing how hard it is for her . I wish mother would let us do things for her . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST That strength is a flame frailness ca n't put out . It 's a great thing for us to have her ,  --  this touch with the life behind us . SILAS Yes . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see those things and say them . What a lot I 'd ' a'missed if I had n't had what you 've seen . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Oh , you only think that because you 've got to be generous . SILAS I 'm not generous . I 'm seeing something now . Something about you . I 've been thinking of it a good deal lately  --  it 's got something to do with  --  with the hill . I 've been thinkin ' what it 's meant all these years to have a family like yours next place to . They did something pretty nice for the corn belt when they drove you out of Hungary . Funny  --  how things do n't end the way they begin . I mean , what begins do n't end . It 's another thing ends . Set out to do something for your own country  --  and maybe you do n't quite do the thing you set out to do  --  p. 18 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No . SILAS But do something for a country a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've not done much for any country . SILAS Brusquely . Where 's your left arm  --  may I be so bold as to inquire ? Though your left arm 's nothing alongside  --  what ca n't be measured . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST When I think of what I dreamed as a young man  --  it seems to me my life has failed . SILAS Raising his glass . Well , if your life 's failed  --  I like failure Grandmother Morton returns with her cookies . GRANDMOTHER MORTON There 's two kinds  --  Mr. Fejevary . These have seeds in ' em . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Thank you . I 'll try a seed cookie first . SILAS Mother , you 'll have a little glass of wine ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON I do n't need wine . SILAS Well , I do n't know as we need it . GRANDMOTHER MORTON No , I do n't know as you do . But I did n't go to war . p. 19 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Then have a little wine to celebrate that . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's cold . Fejevary brings it to her , and the cookies . The Indians used to like cookies . I was talking to that young whippersnapper about the Indians . One time I saw an Indian watching me from a bush . Points . Right out there . I was never afraid of Indians when you could see the whole of em  --  but when you could see nothin ' but their bright eyes  --  movin ' through leaves  --  I declare they made me nervous . After he 'd been there an hour I could n't seem to put my mind on my work . So I thought , Red or White , a man 's a man  --  I 'll take him some cookies . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It succeeded ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON So well that those leaves had eyes next day . But he brought me a fish to trade . He was a nice boy . SILAS Probably we killed him . GRANDMOTHER MORTON I du n no . Maybe he killed us . Will Owens ' family was massacred just after this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something kind of uncertain about the Indians . SILAS I guess they found something kind of uncertain about us. p. 20 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Six o ' one and half a dozen of another . Usually is . SILAS To Fejevary . I wonder if I 'm wrong . You see , I never went to school  --  GRANDMOTHER MORTON I do n't know why you say that , Silas . There was two winters you went to school . SILAS Yes , mother , and I 'm glad I did , for I learned to read there , and I liked the geography globe . It made the earth so nice to think about . And one day the teacher told us all about the stars , and I had that to think of when I was driving at night . The other boys did n't believe it was so . But I knew it was so ! But I mean school  --  the way Mr. Fejevary went to school . He went to universities . In his own countries  --  in other countries . All the things men have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since first they began to think  --  all that was put before him . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST With a gentle smile . I fear I left a good deal of it untouched . SILAS You took aplenty . Tell in your eyes you 've thought lots about what 's been thought . And that 's what I was setting out to say . It makes something of men  --  learning . A house that 's full of books makes a different kind of people . Oh , of course , if the books are n't there just to show off . p. 21 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Like in Mary Baldwin 's new house . SILAS Trying hard to see it . It 's not the learning itself  --  it 's the life that grows up from learning . Learning 's like soil . Like  --  like fertilizer . Get richer . See more . Feel more . You believe that ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Culture should do it . SILAS Does in your house . You somehow know how it is for the other fellow more ' n we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've your wood to chop an ' your water to carry , when you kill your own cattle and hogs , tend your own horses and hens , make your butter , soap , and cook for whoever the Lord sends ,  --  there 's none too many hours of the day left to be polite in . SILAS You 're right , mother . It had to be that way . But now that we buy our soap ,  --  we do n't want to say what soap-making made us . GRANDMOTHER MORTON We 're honest . SILAS Yes . In a way . But there 's another kind o ' honesty , seems to me , goes with that more seein ' kind of kindness . Our honesty with the Indians was little to brag on . GRANDMOTHER MORTON You fret more about the Indians than anybody else does . p. 22 SILAS To look out at that hill sometimes makes me ashamed . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Land sakes , you did n't do it . It was the government . And what a government does is nothing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about that . Why is he here ? Why is Felix Fejevary not rich and grand in Hungary today ? ' Cause he was ashamed of what his government was . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well , that was a foreign government . SILAS A seeing how ' t is for the other person  --  a bein ' that other person , kind of honesty . Joke of it , ' t would do something for you . ' T would ' a done something for us to have been Indians a little more . My father used to talk about Blackhawk  --  they was friends . I saw Blackhawk once  --  when I was a boy . To Fejevary . Guess I told you . You know what he looked like ? He looked like the great of the earth . Noble . Noble like the forests  --  and the Mississippi  --  and the stars . His face was long and thin and you could see the bones and the bones were beautiful . Looked like something that 's never been caught . He was something many nights in his canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself has got a mind and that the land would rather have had the Indians . p. 23 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well do n't let folks hear you say it . They 'd think you was plum crazy . SILAS I s'pose they would . Turning to Fejevary . But after you 've walked a long time over the earth  --  and you all alone , did n't you ever feel something coming up from it that 's like thought ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I 'm afraid I never did . But  --  I wish I had . SILAS I love land  --  this land . I suppose that 's why I never have the feeling that I own it . GRANDMOTHER MORTON If you do n't own it  --  I want to know ! What do you think we come here for  --  your father and me ? What do you think we left our folks for  --  left the world of white folks  --  schools and stores and doctors and set out in a covered wagon for we did n't know what ? We lost a horse . Lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be . You were born in that covered wagon . You know that . But what you do n't know is what that 's like  --  without your own roof  --  or fire  --  without  --  She turns her face away . SILAS No . No , mother , of course not . Now  --  now is n't this too bad ? I do n't say things right . It 's because I never went to school . p. 24 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Her face shielded . You went to school two winters . SILAS Yes . Yes , mother . So I did . And I 'm glad I did . GRANDMOTHER MORTON With the determination of one who will not have her own pain looked at . Mrs. Fejevary 's pansy bed doing well this summer ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It 's beautiful this summer . She was so pleased with the new purple kind you gave her . I do wish you could get over and see them . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Yes . Well , I 've seen lots of pansies . Suppose it was pretty fine-sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too fine sounding to seem much like the war . SILAS I 'd like to go to a war celebration where they never mentioned war . There 'd be a way to celebrate victory . Hearing a step , looking out . Mother , here 's Felix . Felix , a well-dressed young man comes in . GRANDMOTHER MORTON How do , Felix ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And how do you do , Grandmother Morton ? p. 25 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well , I 'm still here . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Of course you are . It would n't be coming home if you were n't . GRANDMOTHER MORTON I 've got some cookies for you , Felix . I set ' em out , so you would n't have to steal them . John and Felix was hard on the cookie jar . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Where is John ? SILAS Who is pouring a glass of wine for Felix . You 've not seen John yet ? He was in town for the exercises . I bet those young devils ran off to the race-track . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be home sometime . Mary and the girls  --  do n't ask me where they are . They 'll drive old Bess all over the county before they drive her to the barn . Your father and I come on home ' cause I wanted to have a talk with him . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Getting into the old uniforms makes you want to talk it all over again ? SILAS The war ? Well , we did do that . But all that makes me want to talk about what 's to come , about  --  what ' t was all for . Great things are to come , Felix . And before you are through . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I 've been thinking about them myself  --  walking around the town today . It 's grown so much this year , and in a way that means more growing  --  that big glocuse plant going up down the river , the new lumber mill  --  all that means many more people . p. 26 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And they 've even bought ground for a steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cornfields  --  a big rich place  --  that 's bound to be . It 's written in the lay o ' the land and the way the river flows . But first tell us about Harvard College , Felix . Ai n't it a fine thing for us all to have Felix coming home from that wonderful place ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You make it seem wonderful . SILAS Ah , you know it 's wonderful  --  know it so well you do n't have to say it . It 's something you 've got . But to me it 's wonderful the way the stars are wonderful  --  this place where all that the world has learned is to be drawn from like  --  like a spring . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You almost say what Matthew Arnold says  --  a distinguished new English writer who speaks of : " The best that has been thought and said in the world . " SILAS " The best that has been thought and said in the world ! " Slowly rising , and as if the dream of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hill is for ! Pointing . Do n't you see it ? End of our trail , we climb a hill and plant a college . Plant a college , so 's after we are gone that college says for us , says in people learning has made more : " This is why we took this land ! " p. 27 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Incredulous . You mean , Silas , you 're going to give the hill away ? SILAS The hill at the end of our trail  --  how could we keep that ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well I want to know why not ! Hill or level  --  land 's land and not a thing you give away . SILAS Well , do n't scold me . I 'm not giving it away . It 's giving itself away , get down to it . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Do n't talk to me as if I was feeble-minded . SILAS I 'm talking with all the mind I 've got . If there 's not mind in what I say , it 's because I 've got no mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humorously . Have n't I ? You ought to know . Seeing as you gave it to me . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Ah no  --  I did n't give it to you . SILAS Well , you made me know ' t was there . You said things that woke things in me and I thought about them as I ploughed . And that made me know there had to be a college there  --  wake things in minds  --  so ploughin 's more than ploughing . What do you say , Felix ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It  --  it 's a big idea , Uncle Silas . I love the way you put it . It 's only that I 'm wondering  --  p. 28 SILAS Wondering how it can ever be a Harvard College ? Well it ca n't . And it need n't be . Stubbornly . It 's a college in the cornfields  --  where the Indian maize once grew . And it 's for the boys of the cornfields  --  and the girls . There 's few can go to Harvard College  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head from the hill to Felix . Harvard on a hill ? As Felix smiles no , Silas turns back to the hill . A college should be on a hill . They can see it then from far around . See it as they go out to the barn in the morning ; see it when they 're shutting up at night . ' Twill make a difference  --  even to them that never go . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Now , Silas  --  do n't be hasty . SILAS Hasty ? It 's been company to me for years . Came to me one night  --  must ' a ' been ten years ago  --  middle of a starry night as I was comin ' home from your place . To Fejevary . I 'd gone over to lend a hand with a sick horse an '  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST With a grateful smile . That was nothing new . SILAS Well , say , I 'd sit up with a sick horse that belonged to the meanest man unhung . But  --  there were stars that night had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . And the hill  --  Felix , in all your travels east , did you ever see anything more beautiful than that hill ? p. 29 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It 's like sculpture . SILAS Hm . The wistfulness with which he speaks of that outside his knowledge . I s'pose ' t is . It 's the way it rises  --  somehow  --  as if it knew it rose from wide and fertile lands . I climbed the hill that night . To Fejevary . You 'd been talkin ' . As we waited between medicines you told me about your life as a young man . All you 'd lived through seemed to  --  open up to you that night  --  way things do at times . Guess it was ' cause you thought you was goin ' to lose your horse . See , that was Colonel , the sorrel , was n't it ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes . Good old Colonel . SILAS You 'd had a long run o ' off luck . Had n't got things back in shape since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , did you ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Thanks to you . SILAS Thanks to the medicine I keep in the back kitchen . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You encouraged him . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Silas has a way with all the beasts . SILAS We 've got the same kind of minds  --  the beasts and me. p. 30 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Silas , I wish you would n't talk like that  --  and with Felix just home from Harvard College . SILAS Same kind of minds  --  except that mine goes on a little farther . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Well , I 'm glad to hear you say that . SILAS Well , there we sat  --  you an ' me  --  middle of a starry night , out beside your barn . And I guess it came over you kind of funny you should be there with me  --  way off the Mississippi , tryin ' to save a sick horse . Seemed to  --  bring your life to life again . You told me what you studied in that fine old university you loved  --  in Vienna ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took hold o ' you and you talked  --  way you used to , I suppose . The years , o' course , had rubbed some of it off . Your face as you went on about the vision  --  you called it , vision of what life could be . I knew that night there was things I had never got wind of . When I went away  --  knew I ought to go home to bed  --  hayin ' at daybreak . " Go to bed ? " I said to myself . " Strike this dead when you 've never had it before , may never have it again ? " I climbed the hill . Blackhawk was there . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Why he was dead . SILAS He was there  --  on his own old hill , with me and the stars . And I said to him  --  p. 31 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Silas ! SILAS Says I to him , " Yes  --  that 's true ; it 's more yours than mine , you had it first and loved it best . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Not my hill , not your hill , but  --  hill of vision , said I to him . Here shall come visions of a better world than was ever seen by you or me , old Indian chief . Oh , I was drunk , plum drunk . GRANDMOTHER MORTON I should think you was . And what about the next day 's hay ? SILAS A day in the hayfield is a day 's hayin '  --  but a night on the hill  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST We do n't have them often , do we , Uncle Silas ? SILAS I would n't ' a had that one but for your father , Felix . Thank God they drove you out o ' Hungary ! And it 's all so dog-gone queer . Ai n't it queer how things blow from mind to mind  --  like seeds . Lord A'mighty  --  you do n't know where they 'll take hold . Children 's voices off . GRANDMOTHER MORTON There come those children up from the creek  --  soppin ' wet , I warrant . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we raise more of ' em than we used to . I buried three  --  first ten years I was here . Need n't ' a happened  --  if we 'd known what we know now , and if we had n't been alone . With all her strength . I do n't know what you mean  --  the hill 's not yours ! p. 32 SILAS It 's the future 's , mother  --  so 's we can know more than we know now . GRANDMOTHER MORTON We know it now . ' T was then we did n't know it . I worked for that hill ! And I tell you to leave it to your own children . SILAS There 's other land for my own children . This is for all the children . GRANDMOTHER MORTON What 's all the children to you ? SILAS Derisively . Oh , mother  --  what a thing for you to say ! You who were never too tired to give up your own bed so the stranger could have a better bed . GRANDMOTHER MORTON That was different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1ST So are we . Silas turns to him with quick appreciation . GRANDMOTHER MORTON That 's just talk . We 're settled now . Children of other old settlers are getting rich . I should think you 'd want yours to . SILAS I want other things more . I want to pay my debts ' fore I 'm too old to know they 're debts . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Momentarily startled . Debts ? Huh ! More talk . You do n't owe any man . p. 33 SILAS I owe him . Nodding to Fejevary . And the red boys here before me . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Fiddlesticks . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You have n't read Darwin , have you , Uncle Silas ? SILAS Who ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Darwin , the great new man  --  and his theory of the survival of the fittest ? SILAS No . No , I do n't know things like that , Felix . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I think he might make you feel better about the Indians . In the struggle for existence , many must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . SILAS Us and the Indians ? Guess I do n't know what you mean  --  fittest . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He calls it that . Best fitted to the place in which one finds one 's self , having the qualities that can best cope with conditions  --  do things . From the beginning of life it 's been like that . He shows the growth of life from forms that were barely alive , the lowest animal forms  --  jellyfish  --  up to man . SILAS Oh , yes , that 's the thing the churches are so upset about  --  that we come from monkeys . p. 34 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes . One family of ape is the direct ancestor of man . GRANDMOTHER MORTON You 'd better read your Bible , Felix . SILAS Do people believe this ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST The whole intellectual world is at war about it . The best scientists accept it . Teachers are losing their positions for believing it . Of course , ministers ca n't believe it . GRANDMOTHER MORTON I should think not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's so discouraging ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Gently . But is it that ? It almost seems to me we have to accept it because it is so encouraging . Holding out his hand . Why have we hands ? GRANDMOTHER MORTON Cause God gave them to us , I s'pose . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST But that 's rather general , and there is n't much in it to give us self-confidence . But when you think we have hands because ages back  --  before life had taken form as man , there was an impulse to do what had never been done  --  when you think that we have hands today because from the first of life there have been adventurers  --  those of best brain and courage who wanted to be more than life had been , and that from aspiration has come doing , and doing has shaped the thing with which to do  --  it gives our hand a history which should make us want to use it well . p. 35 SILAS Breathed from deep . Well , by God ! And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did n't you tell me ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I 've been thinking about it . I have n't known what to believe . This hurts  --  beliefs of earlier years . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST The things it hurts will have to go . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I do n't know about that , Felix . Perhaps in time we 'll find truth in them . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Oh , if you feel that way , father . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Do n't be kind to me , my boy , I 'm not that old . SILAS But think what it is you 've said ! If it 's true that we made ourselves  --  made ourselves out of the wanting to be more  --  created ourselves you might say , by our own courage  --  our  --  what is it ?  --  aspiration . Why , I ca n't take it in . I have n't got the mind to take it in . And what mind I have got says no . It 's too  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like I got this very slowly other way around . From underneath . As if I 'd known it all along  --  but have just found out I know it ! Yes . The earth told me . The beasts told me. p. 36 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Fine place to learn things from . SILAS Anyhow , have n't I seen it ? To Fejevary . In your face have n't I seen thinking make a finer face ? How long has this taken Felix to  --  well , you might say , bring us where we are now ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Oh , we do n't know how many millions of years since earth first stirred . SILAS Then we are what we are because through all that time there 've been them that wanted to be more than life had been . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST That 's it , Uncle Silas . SILAS But  --  why , then we are n't finished yet ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No . We take it on from here . SILAS Slowly . Then if we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be more than life has been , we go back on all that life behind us ; go back on  --  the  --  Unable to formulate it , he looks to Fejevary . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Go back on the dreaming and the daring of a million years . After a moment 's pause Silas gets up , opens the closet door . p. 37 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Silas , what you doing ? SILAS Who has taken out a box . I 'm lookin ' for the deed to the hill . GRANDMOTHER MORTON What you going to do with it ? SILAS I 'm goin ' to get it out of my hands . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Get it out of your hands ? He has it now . Deed your father got from the government the very year the government got it from the Indians ? Rising . Give me that ! She turns to Fejevary . Tell him he 's crazy . We got the best land ' cause we was first here . We got a right to keep it . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a serious thing to give away one 's land . SILAS You ought to know . You did it . Are you sorry you did it ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No . But was n't that different ? SILAS How was it different ? Yours was a fight to make life more , was n't it ? Well , let this be our way . GRANDMOTHER MORTON What 's all that got to do with giving up the land that should provide for your own children ? p. 38 SILAS Is n't it providing for them to give them a better world to live in ? Felix  --  you 're young , I ask you , ai n't it providing for them to give them a chance to be more than we are ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I think you 're entirely right , Uncle Silas . But it 's the practical question that  --  SILAS If you 're right , the practical question is just a thing to fix up . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I fear you do n't realize the immense amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a start . You would have to interest rich men ; you 'd have to have a community in sympathy with the thing you wanted to do . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Ca n't you see , Silas , that we 're all against you ? SILAS All against me ? To Fejevary . But how can you be ? Look at the land we walked in and took ! Was there ever such a chance to make life more ? Why the buffalo here before us was more than we if we do nothing but prosper ! God damn us if we sit here rich and fat and forget man 's in the mankin ' . Affirming against this . There will one day be a college in these cornfields by the Mississippi because long ago a great dream was fought for in Hungary . And I say to that old dream , Wake up , old dream ! Wake up and fight ! You say rich men . Holding it out , but it is not taken . I give you this deed to take to rich men to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best land he 's got . That ought to make rich men stop and think . p. 39 GRANDMOTHER MORTON Stop and think he 's a fool . SILAS To Fejevary . It 's you can make them know he 's not a fool . When you tell this way you can tell it , they 'll feel in you what 's more than them . They 'll listen . GRANDMOTHER MORTON I tell you , Silas , folks are too busy . SILAS " Too busy ! " Too busy bein ' nothin ' ? If it 's true that we created ourselves out of the thoughts that came , then thought is not something outside the business of life . Thought  --  with his gift for wonder why thought 's our chance . I know now . Why I ca n't forget the Indians . We killed their joy before we killed them . We made them less . To Fejevary , and as if sure he is now making it clear . I got to give it back  --  their hill . I give it back to joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Moved but unconvinced . But , my friend , there are men who have no aspiration . That 's why , to me , this is as a light shining from too far . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Old things waked in her . Light shining from far . We used to do that . We never pulled the curtains . I used to want to  --  you like to be to yourself when night comes  --  but we always left a lighted window for the traveler who 'd lost his way . p. 40 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I should think that would have exposed you to the Indians . GRANDMOTHER MORTON Yes . Impatiently . Well , you ca n't put out a light just because it may light the wrong person . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No . And this is as a light to him . He turns to the hill . No . SILAS With gentleness , and profoundly . That 's it . Look again . Maybe your eyes are stronger now . Do n't you see it ? I see that college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what come at the last of that thinking that breathes from the earth . I see it  --  but I want to know it 's real before I stop knowing . Then maybe I can lie under the same sod with the red boys and not be ashamed . We 're not old ! Let 's fight ! Wake in other men what you woke in me ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And so could I pay my debt to America . His hand goes out . SILAS Giving him the deed . And to the dreams of a million years ! Standing near the open door their hands are gripped in compact . ( Curtain ) @x Scene : A corridor in the library of Morton College , October of the year 1920 , upon the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of its founding . This is an open place in the stacks of books , which are seen at both sides . There is a reading table before the big rear window . This window opens out , but does not extend to the floor ; only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high window . Outside is seen the top of a tree . This outer wall of the building is on a slant , so that the entrance right is rear , and the left is front . Right front is a section of a huge square column . On the rear of this , facing the window , is hung a picture of Silas Morton . Two men are standing before this portrait . Senator Lewis is the middle-western state senator . He is not of the city from which Morton College rises , but of a more country community farther in-state . Felix Fejevary , now nearing the age of his father in the first act , is an American of the more sophisticated type  --  prosperous , having the poise of success in affairs and place in society . SENATOR LEWIS And this was the boy who founded the place , eh ? It was his idea ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes , and his hill . I was there the afternoon he told my father there must be a college here . I was n't any older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised by this . p. 42 SENATOR LEWIS Well , he enlisted a good man when he let you in on it . I 've been told the college would n't be what it is today but for you , Mr. Fejevary . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I have a sentiment about it , and where our sentiment is , there our work goes also . SENATOR LEWIS Yes . Well , it was those mainsprings of sentiment that won the war . He is pleased with this . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Nodding . Morton College did her part in winning the war . SENATOR LEWIS I know . A fine showing . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And we 're holding up our end right along . You 'll see the boys drill this afternoon . It 's a great place for them , here on the hill  --  shows up from so far around . They 're a fine lot of fellows . You know , I presume , that they went in as strike-breakers during the trouble down here at the steel works . The plant would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason I venture to propose this thing of a state appropriation for enlargement . Why do n't we sit down a moment ? There 's no conflict with the state university  --  they have their territory , we have ours . Ours is an important one  --  industrially speaking . The state will lose nothing in having a good strong college here  --  a **28;437;TOOLONG college . p. 43 SENATOR LEWIS I admit I am very favorably impressed . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I hope you 'll tell your committee so  --  and let me have a chance to talk to them . SENATOR LEWIS Let 's see , have n't you a pretty radical man here ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I wonder if you mean Holden ? SENATOR LEWIS Holden 's the man . I 've read things that make me question his Americanism . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Oh  --  Gesture of depreciation . I do n't think he is so much a radical as a particularly human human-being . SENATOR LEWIS But we do n't want radical human beings . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher , you know . And then  --  he 's a scholar . He betrays here his feeling of superiority to his companion , but too subtly for his companion to get it . SENATOR LEWIS Oh  --  scholar . We can get scholars enough . What we want is Americans . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Americans who are scholars . p. 44 SENATOR LEWIS You can pick ' em off every bush  --  pay them a little more than they 're paid in some other cheap John College . Excuse me  --  I do n't mean this is a cheap John College . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Of course not . One could n't think that of Morton College . But that  --  pay them a little more , interests me . That 's another reason I want to talk to your committee on appropriations . We claim to value education and then we let highly trained , gifted men fall behind the plumber . SENATOR LEWIS Well , that 's the plumber 's fault . Let the teachers talk to the plumber . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the plumber . He might tell them what to do about it . In fact , is telling them . SENATOR LEWIS That 's ridiculous . They ca n't serve both God and mammon . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Then let God give them mammon . I mean , let the state appropriate . SENATOR LEWIS Of course this state , Mr. Fejevary , appropriates no money for radicals . Excuse me , but why do you keep this man Holden ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST In the scholar 's world we 're known because of him . And really , Holden 's not a radical  --  in the worst sense . What he does n't see is  --  expediency . Not enough the man of affairs to realize that we ca n't always have literally what we have theoretically . He 's an idealist . Something of the  --  man of vision . p. 45 SENATOR LEWIS If he had the right vision he 'd see that we do n't every minute have literally what we have theoretically because we 're fighting to keep the thing we have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only vision . Take you , Mr. Fejevary  --  a banker . These teachers  --  books  --  books ! Pushing all books back . Why , if they had to take for one day the responsibility that falls on your shoulders  --  big decisions to make  --  man among men  --  and all the time worries , irritations , particularly now with labor riding the high horse like a fool ! I know something about these things . I went to the State House because my community persuaded me it was my duty . But I 'm the man of affairs , myself . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Oh yes , I know . Your company did much to develop that whole northern part of the state . SENATOR LEWIS I think I may say we did . Well , that 's why , after three sessions , I 'm chairman of the appropriations committee . I know how to use money to promote the state . So  --  teacher ? That would be a perpetual vacation to me . Now , if you want my advice , Mr. Fejevary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stronger if you let this fellow Holden go . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I 'm going to have a talk with Professor Holden . p. 46 SENATOR LEWIS Tell him it 's for his own good . The idea of a college professor standing up for conscientious objectors ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST That does n't quite state the case . Fred Jordan was one of Holden 's students  --  a student he valued . He felt Jordan was perfectly sincere in his objection . SENATOR LEWIS Sincere in his objections ! The nerve of him thinking it was his business to be sincere ! FELIX . SENATOR LEWIS I should hope so . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Holden fought that , but within the college . What brought him into the papers was his protest against the way the boy has been treated in prison . SENATOR LEWIS What 's the difference how he 's treated ? You know how I 'd treat him ? A movement as though pulling a trigger . If I did n't know you for the American you are , I would n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm simply trying to see it all sides around . SENATOR LEWIS Makes me see red . p. 47 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST With a smile . But we must n't meet red with red . SENATOR LEWIS What 's Holden fussing about  --  that they do n't give him caviar on toast ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST That they did n't give him books . Holden felt it was his business to fuss about that . SENATOR LEWIS Well , when your own boy ' stead of whining around about his conscience , stood up and offered his life ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes . And my nephew gave his life . SENATOR LEWIS That so ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Silas Morton 's grandson died in France . My sister Madeline married Ira Morton , son of Silas Morton . SENATOR LEWIS I knew there was a family connection between you and the Mortons . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Speaking with reserve . They played together as children and married as soon as they were grown up . SENATOR LEWIS So this was your sister 's boy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son ! p. 48 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Speaking of her with effort . My sister died  --  long ago . Pulled to an old feeling ; with an effort releasing himself . But Ira is still out at the old place  --  place the Morton 's took up when they reached the end of their trail  --  as Uncle Silas used to put it . Why , it 's a hundred years ago that Grandmother Morton began  --  making cookies here . She was the first white woman in this county . SENATOR LEWIS Proud woman ! To have begun the life of this state ! Oh , our pioneers ! If they could only see us now , and know what they did ! Fejevary is silent ; he does not look quite happy . I suppose Silas Morton 's son is active in the college management . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No , Ira is not a social being . Fred 's death about finished him He had been  --  strange for years , ever since my sister died  --  when the children were little . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible circumstances . SENATOR LEWIS I can see that you thought a great deal of your sister , Mr. Fejevary . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Oh , she was beautiful and  --  bitterly it should n't have gone like that . p. 49 SENATOR LEWIS Seems to me I 've heard something about Silas Morton 's son  --  though perhaps it was n't this one . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Ira is the only one living here now ; the others have gone farther west . SENATOR LEWIS Is n't there something about corn ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes . His corn has several years taken the prize  --  best in the state . He 's experimented with it  --  created a new kind . They 've given it his name  --  Morton corn . It seems corn is rather fascinating to work with  --  very mutable stuff . It 's a good thing Ira has it , for it 's about the only thing he does care for now . Oh , Madeline , of course . He has a daughter here in the college  --  Madeline Morton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to have you meet Madeline  --  she 's a great girl , though  --  peculiar . SENATOR LEWIS Well , that makes a girl interesting , if she is n't peculiar the wrong way . Sounds as if her home life might make her a little peculiar . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Madeline stays here in town with us a good part of the time . Mrs. Fejevary is devoted to her  --  we all are . A boy starts to come through from right . Hello , see who 's here . This is my boy . Horace , this is Senator Lewis , who is interested in the college . p. 50 HORACE Shaking hands . How do you do , Senator Lewis ? SENATOR LEWIS Pleased to see you , my boy . HORACE Am I butting in ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Not seriously ; but what are you doing in the library ? I thought this was a day off . HORACE I 'm looking for a book . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Affectionately bantering . You are , Horace ? Now how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham Lincoln . SENATOR LEWIS You could n't do better . HORACE I 'll show those dirty dagoes where they get off ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You could n't show them a little more elegantly ? HORACE I 'm going to sick the Legion on ' em . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Are you talking about the Hindus ? HORACE Yes , the dirty dagoes . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Hindus are n't dagoes you know , Horace . p. 51 HORACE Well , what 's the difference ? This foreign element gets my goat . SENATOR LEWIS My boy , you talk like an American . But what do you mean  --  Hindus ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST There are two young Hindus here as students . And they 're good students . HORACE Sissies . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST But they must preach the gospel of free India  --  non-British India . SENATOR LEWIS Oh , that wo n't do . HORACE They 're nothing but Reds , I 'll say . Well , one of ' em 's going back to get his . Grins . FELIX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them is wanted back home . SENATOR LEWIS I remember now . He 's to be deported . HORACE And when they get him  --  Movement as of pulling a rope . They hang there . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST The other two protest against our not fighting the deportation of their comrade . They insist it means death to him . Brushing off a thing that is inclined to worry him . But we ca n't handle India 's affairs . p. 52 SENATOR LEWIS I should think not ! HORACE Why , England 's our ally ! That 's what I told them . But you ca n't argue with people like that . Just wait till I find the speeches of Abraham Lincoln ! Passes through to left . SENATOR LEWIS Fine boy you have , Mr. Fejevary . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He 's a live one . You should see him in a football game . Would n't hurt my feelings in the least to have him a little more of a student , but  --  SENATOR LEWIS Oh , well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and grow into a man among men ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He 'll do that , I think . It was he who organized our boys for the steel strike  --  went right in himself and took a striker 's job . He came home with a black eye one night , presented to him by a picket who started something by calling him a scab . But Horace was n't thinking about his eye . According to him , it was not in the class with the striker 's upper lip . " Father , " he said , " I gave him more red than he could swallow . The blood just  --  " Well , I 'll spare you  --  but Horace 's muscle is one hundred per cent American . Going to the window . Let me show you something . You can see the old Morton place off on that first little hill . Pointing left . The first rise beyond the valley . p. 53 SENATOR LEWIS The long low house ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST That 's it . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the hill , so the Morton place is still a farm . SENATOR LEWIS But you 're growing all the while . The town 'll take the cornfield yet . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes , our steel works is making us a city . SENATOR LEWIS And this old boy turning to the portrait of Silas Morton can look out on his old home  --  and watch the valley grow . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes  --  that was my idea . His picture really should be in Memorial Hall , but I thought Uncle Silas would like to be up here among the books , and facing the old place . With a laugh . I confess to being a little sentimental . SENATOR LEWIS We Americans have lots of sentiment , Mr. Fejevary . It 's what makes us  --  what we are . Fejevary does not speak ; there are times when the senator seems to trouble him . Well , this is a great site for a college . You can see it from the whole country round . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reverence for education . It grew , in part , out of his feeling for my father . He was a poet  --  really , Uncle Silas . Looking at the picture . He gave this hill for a college that we might become a deeper , more sensitive people  --  Two girls , convulsed with the giggles , come tumbling in. p. 54 DORIS Confused . Oh  --  oh , excuse us . FLOSSIE Foolishly . We did n't know anybody was here . Mr. Fejevary looks at them sternly . The girls retreat . SENATOR LEWIS Laughing . Oh , well , girls will be girls . I 've got three of my own . Horace come back , carrying an open book . HORACE Say , this must be a misprint . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Glancing at the back of the book . Oh , I think not . HORACE From his first inaugural address to Congress , March 4 , 1861 . Reads . " This country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it . " Well , that 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it , "  --  after a brief consideration I suppose that that 's all right  --  but listen ! " or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it . " FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He was speaking in another age . An age of different values . p. 55 SENATOR LEWIS Terms change their significance from generation to generation . HORACE I suppose they do  --  but that puts me in bad with these lice . They quoted this and I said they were liars . SENATOR LEWIS And what 's the idea ? They 're weary of our existing government and are about to dismember or overthrow it ? HORACE I guess that 's the dope . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Look here , Horace  --  speak accurately . Was it in relation to America they quoted this ? HORACE Well , maybe they were talking about India then . But they were standing up for being revolutionists . We were giving them an earful about it , and then they sprung Lincoln on us . Got their nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SENATOR LEWIS The fact that they are quoting it shows it 's being misapplied . HORACE Approvingly . I 'll tell them that . But gee  --  Lincoln ought a been more careful what he said . Ignorant people do n't know how to take such things . Goes back with book . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Want to take a look through the rest of the library ? We have n't been up this way yet  --  Motioning left . We need a better scientific library . They are leaving now . Oh , we simply must have more money . The whole thing is fairly bursting its shell . p. 56 DORIS Venturing in cautiously , from the other side , looking back , beckoning . They 've gone . FLOSSIE Sure ? DORIS Well , are they here ? And I saw them , I tell you  --  they went up to science . FLOSSIE Moving the Senator 's hat on the table . But they 'll come back . DORIS What if they do ? We 're only looking at a book . Running her hand along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puts it in the book . They are bent with giggling as Horace returns . HORACE For the love o ' Pete , what 's the joke ? Taking the book from the helpless girl . Matthew Arnold . My idea of nowhere to go for a laugh . When I wrote my theme on him last week he was so dry I had to go out and get a Morton Sundee . The girls are freshly attacked , though all of this in a subdued way , mindful of others in the library . Say , how 'd you get that way ? DORIS Now , Horace , do n't you tell . HORACE What 'd I tell . except  --  seeing the paper Um hum  --  what 's this ? p. 57 DORIS Trying to get it from him . Horace , now do n't you . A tussle . You great strong mean thing ! Fussie ! Make him stop . She gets the paper by tearing it . HORACE My dad 's around here  --  showing the college off to a politician . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll back you both out there starts to do it and  --  DORIS Horace ! You 're just horrid . HORACE Sure I 'm horrid . That 's the way I want to be . Takes the paper , reads . " To Eben You are the idol of my dreams I worship from afar . " What is this ? FLOSSIE Now , listen , Horace , and do n't you tell . You know Eben Weeks . He 's the homeliest man in school . Would n't you say so ? HORACE Awful jay . Like to get some of the jays out of here . DORIS But listen . Of course , no girl would look at him . So we 've thought up the most killing joke . Stopped by giggles from herself and Fussie . Now , he has n't handed in his Matthew Arnold dope . I heard old Mac hold him up for it  --  and what 'd you think he said ? That he 'd been ploughing . Said he was trying to run a farm and go to college at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORACE We ought a  --  make it more unpleasant for some of those jays . Gives the school a bad name . FLOSSIE But , listen , Horace , honest  --  you 'll just die . He said he was going to get the book this afternoon . Now you know what he looks like , but he turns to  --  Both girls are convulsed . DORIS It 'll get him all fussed up ! And for nothing at all ! HORACE Too bad that class of people come here . I think I 'll go to Harvard next year . Have n't broken it to my parental  --  but I 've about made up my mind . DORIS Do n't you think Morton 's a good school , Horace ? HORACE Morton 's all right . Fine for the  --  kindly people who would naturally come here . But one gets an acquaintance at Harvard . Where'd'y ' want these passionate lines ? Fussie and Doris are off again convulsed . HORACE Eye falling on the page where he opens the book . Say , old Bones could spill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For when we say that culture is to know the best that has been thought and said in the world , we simply imply that for culture a system directly tending to that end is necessary in our reading . " He reads it with mock solemnity , delighting Fussie and Doris . " The best that has been thought and said in the world ! " Madeline Morton comes in from right ; she carries a tennis racket. p. 59 MADELINE Both critical and good-humored . You have n't made a large contribution to that , have you , Horace ? HORACE Madeline , you do n't want to let this sarcastic habit grow on you . MADELINE Thanks for the tip . FLOSSIE Oh  --  Madeline . Holds out her hand to take the book from Horace and show it to Madeline . You know  --  DORIS S  --  h . Do n't be silly . To cover this Who you playing with ? HORACE Want me to play with you , Madeline ? MADELINE Genially . I 'd rather play with you than talk to you . HORACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moving through to the other part of the library . But first I 'm looking for a book . HORACE Well , I can tell you without your looking it up , he did say it . But that was an age of different values . Anyway , the fact that they 're quoting it shows it 's being misapplied. p. 60 MADELINE Smiling . Father said so . HORACE On his dignity . Oh , of course  --  if you do n't want to be serious . Madeline laughs and passes on through . DORIS What are you two talking about ? HORACE Madeline happened to overhear a little discussion down on the campus . FLOSSIE Listen . You know something ? Sometimes I think Madeline Morton is a highbrow in disguise . HORACE Say , you do n't want to start anything like that . Madeline 's all right . She and I treat each other rough  --  but that 's being in the family . FLOSSIE Well , I 'll tell you something . I heard Professor Holden say Madeline Morton had a great deal more mind than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Holden , he 's erratic . Look at how popular Madeline is . DORIS I should say . What 's the matter with you , Fussie ? FLOSSIE Oh , I did n't mean it really hurt her . HORACE Guess it do n't hurt her much at a dance . Say , what 's this new jazz they were springing last night ? p. 61 DORIS I know ! Now look here , Horace  --  L'me show you . She shows him a step . HORACE I get you . He begins to dance with her ; the book he holds slips to the floor . He kicks it under the table . FLOSSIE Be careful . They 'll be coming back here . Glances off left . DORIS Keep an eye out , Fussie . FLOSSIE From her post . They 're coming ! I tell you , they 're coming ! DORIS Horace , come on . He teasingly keeps hold of her , continuing the dance . At sound of voices , they run off , right . Fussie considers rescuing the book , decides she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , it could be done . There is that surplus , and as long as Morton College is socially valuable  --  right here above the steel works , and making this feature of military training  --  He has picked up his hat . But your Americanism must be unimpeachable , Mr. Fejevary . This man Holden stands in the way . p. 62 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I 'm going to have a talk with Professor Holden this afternoon . If he remains he will  --  It is not easy for him to say give no trouble . Madeline returns . Oh , here 's Madeline  --  Silas Morton 's granddaughter , Madeline Fejevary Morton . This is Senator Lewis , Madeline . SENATOR LEWIS Holding out his hand . How do you do , Miss Morton . I suppose this is a great day for you . MADELINE Why  --  I do n't know . SENATOR LEWIS The fortieth anniversary of the founding of your grandfather 's college ? You must be very proud of your illustrious ancestor . MADELINE I get a bit bored with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MADELINE I suppose because I 've heard so many speeches about him  --  " The sainted pioneer "  --  " The grand old man of the prairies "  --  I 'm sure I have n't any idea what he really was like . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I 've tried to tell you , Madeline . MADELINE Yes . p. 63 SENATOR LEWIS I should think you would be proud to be the granddaughter of this man of vision . MADELINE Her smile flashing . Would n't you hate to be the granddaughter of a phrase ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Trying to laugh it off . Madeline ! How absurd . MADELINE Well , I 'm off for tennis . Nods good-bye and passes on . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Calling to her . Oh , Madeline , if your Aunt Isabel is out there  --  will you tell her where we are ? MADELINE Calling back . All right . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST After a look at his companion . Queer girl , Madeline . Rather  --  moody . SENATOR LEWIS Disapprovingly . Well  --  yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's been hearing a great many speeches about her grandfather . p. 64 SENATOR LEWIS She should be proud to hear them . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Of course she should . Looking in the direction Madeline has gone . I want you to meet my wife , Senator Lewis . SENATOR LEWIS I should be pleased to meet Mrs. Fejevary . I have heard what she means to the college  --  socially . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I think she has given it something it would n't have had without her . Certainly a place in the town that is  --  good for it . And you have n't met our president yet . SENATOR LEWIS Guess I 've met the real president . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Oh  --  no . I 'm merely president of the board of trustees . SENATOR LEWIS " Merely ! " FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I want you to know President Welling . He 's very much the cultivated gentleman . SENATOR LEWIS Cultivated gentlemen are all right . I 'd hate to see a world they ran . FELIX FEJEVARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look up here , then we can go down the shorter way . He goes out right . Senator Lewis turns and examines the books . Fussie slips in , looks at him , hesitates , and then stoops under the table for the Matthew Arnold ( and her poem ) which Horace has kicked there . He turns . p. 65 FLOSSIE Not out from under the table . Oh , I was just looking for a book . SENATOR LEWIS Quite a place to look for a book . FLOSSIE Crawling out . Yes , it got there . I though I 'd put it back . Somebody  --  might want it . SENATOR LEWIS I see , young lady , that you have a regard for books . FLOSSIE Oh , yes , I do have a regard for them . SENATOR LEWIS Holding out his hand . And what is your book ? FLOSSIE Oh  --  it 's  --  it 's nothing . As he continues to hold out his hand , she reluctantly gives the book . SENATOR LEWIS Solemnly . Matthew Arnold ? Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SENATOR LEWIS A master of English ! I am glad , young woman , that you value this book . FLOSSIE Oh yes , I 'm  --  awfully fond of it . Growing more and more nervous as in turning the pages , he nears the poem . p. 66 SENATOR LEWIS I am interested in you young people of Morton College . FLOSSIE That 's so good of you . SENATOR LEWIS What is your favorite study ? FLOSSIE Well  --  An inspiration . I like all of them . SENATOR LEWIS Morton College is coming on very fast , I understand . FLOSSIE Oh , yes , it 's getting more and more of the right people . It used to be a little jay , you know . Of course , the Fejevarys give it class . Mrs. Fejevary  --  is n't she wonderful ? SENATOR LEWIS I have n't seen her yet . Waiting here now to meet her . FLOSSIE Worried by this . Oh , I must  --  must be going . Shall I put the book back ? Holding out her hand . SENATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . Sits down . FLOSSIE Unable to think of any way of getting it . This is where it belongs . SENATOR LEWIS Thank you . Reluctantly she goes out . Senator Lewis pursues Matthew Arnold with the conscious air of a half literate man reading a " great book . " The Fejevarys come in. p. 67 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I found my wife , Senator Lewis . AUNT ISABEL She is a woman of social distinction and charm . How do you do , Senator Lewis ? They shake hands . SENATOR LEWIS It 's a great pleasure to meet you , Mrs. Fejevary . AUNT ISABEL Why do n't we carry Senator Lewis home for lunch ? SENATOR LEWIS Why , you 're very kind . AUNT ISABEL I 'm sure there 's a great deal to talk about , so why not talk comfortably , and really get acquainted ? And we want to tell you the whole story of Morton College  --  the good old American spirit behind it . SENATOR LEWIS I am glad to find you an American , Mrs. Fejevary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one hundred per cent American . Our boys  --  Her boy Horace rushes in . HORACE Wildly . Father ! Will you go after Madeline ? The police have got her ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST What ! p. 68 AUNT ISABEL As he is getting his breath . What absurd thing are you saying , Horace ? HORACE Awful row down on the campus . The Hindus . I told them to keep their mouths shut about Abraham Lincoln . I told them the fact they were quoting him  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Never mind what you told them ! What happened ? HORACE We started to  --  rustle them along a bit . Why they had handbills holding one up as if presenting incriminating evidence  --  the Senator takes it from him telling America what to do about deportation ! Not on this campus  --  I say . So we were  --  we were putting a stop to it . They resisted  --  particularly the fat one . The cop at the corner saw the row  --  came up . He took hold of Bakhshish and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took hold of him  --  well , a bit rough , you might say , when up rushes Madeline and calls to the cop , " Let that boy alone ! " Gee  --  I do n't know just what did happen  --  awful mix-up . Next thing I knew Madeline hauled off and pasted the policeman a fierce one with her tennis racket ! SENATOR LEWIS She struck the officer ? p. 69 HORACE I should say she did . Twice . The second time  --  AUNT ISABEL Horace . Looking at her husband . I  --  I ca n't believe it . HORACE I could have squared it , even then , but for Madeline herself . I told the policeman that she did n't understand  --  that I was her cousin and apologized for her . And she called over at me , " Better apologize for yourself ! " As if there was any sense to that  --  and she  --  she looked like a tiger . Honest , everybody was afraid of her . I kept right on trying to square it , told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college  --  that you were her uncle  --  he would have gone off with just the Hindu , fixed this up later , but Madeline balled it up again  --  did n't care who was her uncle  --  Gee ! He throws open the window . There ! You can see them , at the foot of the hill . A nice thing  --  member of our family led off to the police station ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST To the Senator . Will you excuse me ? AUNT ISABEL Trying to return to the manner of pleasant social things . Senator Lewis will go on home with me , and you  --  he is hurrying out come when you can . To the senator . Madeline is such a high-spirited girl . p. 70 SENATOR LEWIS If she had no regard for the living , she might  --  on this day of all others  --  have considered her grandfather 's memory . Raises his eyes to the picture of Silas Morton . HORACE Gee ! Would n't you say so ? ( Curtain ) p. 71 Act 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Scene I , three hours later . Professor Holden is seated at the table , books before him . He is a man in the fifties . At the moment his care-worn face is lighted by that lift of the spirit which sometimes rewards the scholar who has imaginative feeling . Harry , a student clerk , comes hurrying in . Looks back . HARRY Here 's Professor Holden , Mr. Fejevary . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Mr. Fejevary is looking for me ? HARRY Yes . He goes back , a moment later Mr. Fejevary enters . He has his hat , gloves , stick ; seems tired and disturbed . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Was I mistaken ? I thought our appointment was for five . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Quite right . But things have changed , so I wondered if I might have a little talk with you now . PROFESSOR HOLDEN To be sure . Rising . Shall we go downstairs ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I do n't know . Nice and quiet up here . To Harry , who is now passing through . Harry , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY Yes , it 's locked . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And there 's no one in here ? HARRY No , I 've been all through . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST There 's a committee downstairs . Oh , this is a terrible day . Putting his things on the table . We 'd better stay up here . Harry , when my niece  --  when Miss Morton arrives  --  I want you to come and let me know . Ask her not to leave the building without seeing me . HARRY Yes , sir . He goes out . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Well , wearily it 's been a day . Not the day I was looking for . PROFESSOR HOLDEN No . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You 're very serene up here . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Yes ; I wanted to be  --  serene for a little while . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Looking at the books . Emerson . Whitman . With a smile . Have they anything new to say on economics ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN Perhaps not ; but I wanted to forget economics for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of Morton College . Answering the other man 's look . Yes , I confess I 've been disappointed in the anniversary . As I left Memorial Hall after the exercises this morning , Emerson 's words came into my mind  --  " Give me truth , For I am tired of surfaces And die of inanition . " Well , then I went home  --  Stops , troubled . p. 73 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST How is Mrs. Holden ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN Better , thank you , but  --  not strong . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST She needs the very best of care for a time , does n't she ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN Yes . Silent a moment . Then , this is something more than the fortieth anniversary , you know . It 's the first of the month . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And illness has n't reduced the bills ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN Shaking his head . I did n't want this day to go like that ; so I came up here , to try and touch what used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak despondently of us . And there 's been such a fine note of optimism in the exercises . Speaks with the heartiness of one who would keep himself assured . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I did n't seem to want a fine note of optimism . With roughness . I wanted  --  a gleam from reality . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST To me this is reality  --  the robust spirit created by all these young people . p. 74 PROFESSOR HOLDEN Do you think it is robust ? Hand affectionately on the book before him . I 've been reading Whitman . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST This day has to be itself . Certain things go  --  others come ; life is change . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Perhaps it 's myself I 'm discouraged with . Do you remember the tenth anniversary of the founding of Morton College ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST The tenth ? Oh yes , that was when this library was opened . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I shall never forget your father , Mr. Fejevary , as he stood out there and said the few words which gave these books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to baptise them in the very spirit from which books are born . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He died the following year . PROFESSOR HOLDEN One felt death near . But that did n't seem the important thing . A student who had fought for liberty for mind Of course his face would be sensitive . You must be very proud of your heritage . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes . A little testily . Well , I have certainly worked for the college . I 'm doing my best now to keep it a part of these times . p. 75 PROFESSOR HOLDEN As if this has not reached him . It was later that same afternoon I talked with Silas Morton . We stood at this window and looked out over the valley to the lower hill that was his home . He told me how from that hill he had for years looked up to this one , and why there had to be a college here . I never felt America as that old farmer made me feel it . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Drawn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry to break in with practical things , but alas , I am a practical man  --  forced to be . I too have made a fight  --  though the fight to finance never appears an idealistic one . But I 'm deep in that now , and I must have a little help ; at least , I must not have  --  stumbling blocks . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Am I a stumbling block ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Candidly , with a smile you are a little hard to finance . Here 's the situation . The time for being a little college has passed . We must take our place as one of the important colleges  --  I make bold to say one of the important universities  --  of the middle west . But we have to enlarge before we can grow . Answering Holden 's smile . Yes , it is ironic , but that 's the way of it . It was a nice thing to open the anniversary with fifty thousand from the steel works  --  but fifty thousand dollars  --  nowadays  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do more later , I think , when they see us coming into our own . Meanwhile , as you know , there 's this chance for an appropriation from the state . I find that the legislature , the members who count , are very friendly to Morton College . They like the spirit we have here . Well , now I come to you , and you are one of the big reasons for my wanting to put this over . Your salary makes me blush . It 's all wrong that a man like you should have these petty worries , particularly with Mrs. Holden so in need of the things a little money can do . Now this man Lewis is a reactionary . So , naturally , he does n't approve of you . p. 76 PROFESSOR HOLDEN So naturally I am to go . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Go ? Not at all . What have I just been saying ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN Be silent , then . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Not that either  --  not  --  not really . But  --  be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I want to put up to you . Why not give things a chance to mature in your own mind ? Candidly , I do n't feel you know just what you do think ; is it so awfully important to express  --  confusion ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN The only man who knows just what he thinks at the present moment is the man who has n't done any new thinking in the past ten years . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST With a soothing gesture . You and I need n't quarrel about it . I understand you , but I find it a little hard to interpret you to a man like Lewis . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Then why not let a man like Lewis go to thunder ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And let the college go to thunder ? I 'm not willing to do that . I 've made a good many sacrifices for this college . Given more money than I could afford to give ; given time and thought that I could have used for personal gain . p. 77 PROFESSOR HOLDEN That 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know just why I 've done it . Sentiment , I suppose . I had a very strong feeling about my father , Professor Holden . And his friend Silas Morton . This college is the child of that friendship . Those are noble words in our manifesto : " Morton College was born because there came to this valley a man who held his vision for mankind above his own advantage ; and because that man found in this valley a man who wanted beauty for his fellow-men as he wanted no other thing . " PROFESSOR HOLDEN Taking it up . " Born of the fight for freedom and the aspiration to richer living , we believe that Morton College  --  rising as from the soil itself  --  may strengthen all those here and everywhere who fight for the life there is in freedom , and may , to the measure it can , loosen for America the beauty that breathes from knowledge . " Moved by the words he has spoken . Do you know , I would rather do that  --  really do that  --  than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you see , or rather , what you do n't see is , you have to look at the world in which you find yourself . The only way to stay alive is to grow big . It 's been hard , but I have tried to  --  carry on . p. 78 PROFESSOR HOLDEN And so have I tried to carry on . But it is very hard  --  carrying on a dream . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Well , I 'm trying to make it easier . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Make it easier by destroying the dream ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Not at all . What I want is scope for dreams . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Are you sure we 'd have the dreams after we 've paid this price for the scope ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Now let 's not get rhetorical with one another . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Mr. Fejevary , you have got to let me be as honest with you as you say you are being with me . You have got to let me say what I feel . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PROFESSOR HOLDEN You say you have made sacrifices for Morton College . So have I. FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST How well I know that . PROFESSOR HOLDEN You do n't know all of it . I 'm not sure you understand any of it . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Charmingly . Oh , I think you 're hard on me. p. 79 PROFESSOR HOLDEN I spoke of the tenth anniversary . I was a young man then , just home from Athens . Pulled back into an old feeling . I do n't know why I felt I had to go to Greece . I knew then that I was going to teach something within sociology , and I did n't want anything I felt about beauty to be left out of what I formulated about society . The Greeks  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST As Holden has paused before what he sees . I remember you told me the Greeks were the passion of your student days . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Not so much because they created beauty , but because they were able to let beauty flow into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a romantic young man , smiles it seemed if I could go where they had been  --  what I had felt might take form . Anyway , I had a wonderful time there . Oh , what would n't I give to have again that feeling of life 's infinite possibilities ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Nodding . A youthful feeling . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Softly . I like youth . Well , I was just back , visiting my sister here , at the time of the tenth anniversary . I had a chance then to go to Harvard as instructor . A good chance , for I would have been under a man who liked me . But that afternoon I heard your father speak about books . I talked with Silas Morton . I found myself telling him about Greece . No one had ever felt it as he felt it . It seemed to become of the very bone of him . p. 80 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Affectionately . I know how he used to do . PROFESSOR HOLDEN He put his hands on my shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away . We need you here . Give us this great thing you 've got ! " And so I stayed , for I felt that here was soil in which I could grow , and that one 's whole life was not too much to give to a place with roots like that . A little bitterly . Forgive me if this seems rhetoric . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST A gesture of protest . Silent a moment . You make it  --  hard for me . With exasperation . Do n't you think I 'd like to indulge myself in an exalted mood ? And why do n't I ? I ca n't afford it  --  not now . Wo n't you have a little patience ? And faith  --  faith that the thing we want will be there for us after we 've worked our way through the woods . We are in the woods now . It 's going to take our combined brains to get us out . I do n't mean just Morton College . PROFESSOR HOLDEN No  --  America . As to getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1ST That 's one of your sweeping statements , Holden . Nobody 's all wrong . Even you aren't. p. 81 PROFESSOR HOLDEN And in what ways am I wrong  --  from the standpoint of your Senator Lewis ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He 's not my Senator Lewis , he 's the state 's and we have to take him as he is . Why he objects , of course , to your radical activities . He spoke of your defense of conscientious objectors . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Slowly . I think a man who is willing to go to prison for what he believes has stuff in him no college need turn its back on . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Well , he does n't agree with you  --  nor do I. PROFESSOR HOLDEN Still quietly . And I think a society which permits things to go on which I can prove go on in our federal prisons had better stop and take a fresh look at itself . To stand for that and then talk of democracy and idealism  --  oh , it shows no mentality , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume the prisons do need a cleaning up . As to Fred Jordan , you ca n't expect me to share your admiration . Our own Fred  --  my nephew Fred Morton , went to France and gave his life . There 's some little courage , Holden , in doing that . p. 82 PROFESSOR HOLDEN I 'm not trying to belittle it . But he had the whole spirit of his age with him  --  fortunate boy . The man who stands outside the idealism of his time  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Takes a good deal upon himself , I should say . PROFESSOR HOLDEN There is n't any other such loneliness . You know in your heart it 's a noble courage . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It lacks  --  humility . Holden laughs scoffingly . And I think you lack it . I 'm asking you to coperate with me for the good of Morton College . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Why not do it the other way ? You say enlarge that we may grow . That 's false . It is n't of the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton and Walt Whitman  --  each man being his purest and intensest self . I was full of this fervor when you came in . I 'm more and more disappointed in our students . They 're empty  --  flippant . No sensitive moment opens them to beauty . No exaltation makes them  --  what they had n't known they were . I concluded some of the fault must be mine . The only students I reach are the Hindus . Perhaps Madeline Morton  --  I do n't quite make her out . I too must have gone into a dead stratum . But I can get back . Here alone this afternoon  --  softly I was back . p. 83 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I think we 'll have to let the Hindus go . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Astonished . Go ? Our best students ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST This college is for Americans . I 'm not going to have foreign revolutionists come here and block the things I 've spent my life working for . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I do n't seem to know what you mean , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . I can settle Madeline all right . Looking at his watch . She should be here by now . But I 'm convinced our case before the legislature will be stronger with the Hindus out of here . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Well , I seem to have missed something  --  disgraceful performance  --  the Hindus , Madeline  --  Stops , bewildered . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You mean to say you do n't know about the disturbance out here ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN I went right home after the address . Then came up here alone . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Upon my word , you do lead a serene life . While you 've been sitting here in contemplation I 've been to the police court  --  trying to get my niece out of jail . That 's what comes of having radicals around . p. 84 PROFESSOR HOLDEN What happened ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST One of your beloved Hindus made himself obnoxious on the campus . Giving out handbills about freedom for India  --  howling over deportation . Our American boys would n't stand for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the Hindu in his place . Then Madeline rushes in and it ended in her pounding the policeman with her tennis racket . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Madeline Morton did that ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Sharply . You seem pleased . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I am  --  interested . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Well , I 'm not interested . I 'm disgusted . My niece mixing up in a free-for-all fight and getting taken to the police station ! It 's the first disgrace we 've ever had in our family . PROFESSOR HOLDEN As one who has been given courage . Was n't there another disgrace ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST What do you mean ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN When your father fought his government and was banished from his country . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST That was not a disgrace ! p. 85 PROFESSOR HOLDEN As if in surprise . Was n't it ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST See here , Holden , you ca n't talk to me like that . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I do n't admit you can talk to me as you please and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not a servant . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Yes , and you 're a damned difficult professor . I certainly have tried to  --  PROFESSOR HOLDEN Smiling . Handle me ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I ask you this . Do you know any other institution where you could sit and talk with the executive head as you have here with me ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN I do n't know . Perhaps not . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Then be reasonable . No one is entirely free . That 's nave . It 's rather egotistical to want to be . We 're held by our relations to others  --  by our obligations to the vaguely  --  the ultimate thing . Come now  --  you admit certain dissatisfactions with yourself , so  --  why not go with intensity into just the things you teach  --  and not touch quite so many other things ? p. 86 PROFESSOR HOLDEN I could n't teach anything if I did n't feel free to go wherever that thing took me . Thirty years ago I was asked to come to this college precisely because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of us as a moment in a long sweep , because of my faith in the greater beauty our further living may unfold . Harry enters . HARRY Excuse me . Miss Morton is here now , Mr. Fejevary . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Frowns , hesitates . Ask her to come up here in five minutes . After Harry has gone . I think we 've thrown a scare into Madeline . I thought as long as she 'd been taken to jail it would be no worse for us to have her stay there awhile . She 's been held since one o'clock . That ought to teach her reason . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Is there a case against her ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No , I got it fixed up . Explained that it was just college girl foolishness  --  would n't happen again . One reason I wanted this talk with you first , if I do have any trouble with Madeline I want you to help me . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Oh , I ca n't do that . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to think things over and express herself with a little more dignity . p. 87 PROFESSOR HOLDEN I ask to be excused from being present while you talk with her . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST But why not stay in the library  --  in case I should need you . Just take your books over to the east alcove and go on with what you were doing when I came in . PROFESSOR HOLDEN With a faint smile . I fear I can hardly do that . As to Madeline  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You do n't want to see the girl destroy herself , do you ? I confess I 've always worried about Madeline . If my sister had lived  --  But Madeline 's mother died , you know , when she was a baby . Her father  --  well , you and I talked that over just the other day  --  there 's no getting to him . Fred never worried me a bit  --  just the fine normal boy . But Madeline  --  With an effort throwing it off . Oh , it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 'll be all right between you and me , wo n't it ? Caution over a hard strip of the road , then  --  bigger things ahead . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Slowly , knowing what it may mean . I shall continue to do all I can toward getting Fred Jordan out of prison . It 's a disgrace to America that two years after the war closes he should be kept there  --  much of the time in solitary confinement  --  because he could n't believe in war . It 's small  --  vengeful  --  it 's the Russia of the Czars . I shall do what is in my power to fight the deportation of Gurkul Singh . And certainly I shall leave no stone unturned if you persist in your amazing idea of dismissing the other Hindus from college . For what  --  I ask you ? Dismissed  --  for what ? Because they love liberty enough to give their lives to it ! The day you dismiss them , burn our high-sounding manifesto , Mr. Fejevary , and admit that Morton College now sells her soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEJEVARY , 1ST Well , you force me to be as specific as you are . If you do these things , I can no longer fight for you . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Very well then , I go . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Go where ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN I do n't know  --  at the moment . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I fear you 'll find it harder than you know . Meanwhile , what of your family ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN We will have to manage some way . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It is not easy for a woman whose health  --  in fact whose life  --  is a matter of the best of care to " manage some way . " With real feeling . What is an intellectual position alongside that reality ? You 'd like , of course , to be just what you want to be  --  but is n't there something selfish in that satisfaction ? I 'm talking as a friend now  --  you must know that . You and I have a good many ties , Holden . I do n't believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROFESSOR HOLDEN She has been very , very good to her . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And will be . She cares for her . And our children have been growing up together  --  I love to watch it . Is n't that the reality ? Doing for them as best we can , making sacrifices of  --  of every kind . Do n't let some tenuous , remote thing destroy this flesh and blood thing . p. 89 PROFESSOR HOLDEN As one fighting to keep his head above water . Honesty is not a tenuous , remote thing . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST There 's a kind of honesty is selfishness . We ca n't always have it . Oh , I used to  --  go through things . But I 've struck a pace  --  one does  --  and goes ahead . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Forgive me , but I do n't think you 've had certain temptations to  --  selfishness . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST How do you know what I 've had ? You have no way of knowing what 's in me  --  what other thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's left nothing ? But I find myself here in America . I love those dependent on me . My wife  --  who 's used to a certain manner of living ; my children  --  who are to become part of the America of their time . I 've never said this to another human being  --  I 've never looked at it myself  --  but it 's pretty arrogant to think you 're the only man who has made a sacrifice to fit himself into the age in which he lives . I hear Madeline . This has n't left me in very good form for talking with her . Please do n't go away . Just  --  Madeline comes in , right . She has her tennis racket . Nods to the two men . Holden goes out , left . p. 90 MADELINE Looking after Holden  --  feeling something going on . Then turning to her Uncle , who is still looking after Holden . You wanted to speak to me , Uncle Felix ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Of course I want to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging up my racket like this . The second time it came down on his club . Why do they carry those things ? Perfectly fantastic , I 'll say , going around with a club . But as long as you were asking me what I wanted for my birthday  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Madeline . I am not here to discuss your birthday . MADELINE I 'm sorry  --  smiles to hear that . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You do n't seem much chastened . MADELINE Chastened ? Was that the idea ? Well , if you think that keeping a person where she does n't want to be chastens her ! I never felt less " chastened " than when I walked out of that slimy spot and looked across the street at your nice bank . I should think you 'd hate to  --  with friendly concern . Why , Uncle Felix , you look tired out . p. 91 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I am tired out , Madeline . I 've had a nerve-racking day . MADELINE Is n't that too bad ? Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was n't he a stuff ? But ca n't you go home now and let auntie give you tea and  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Sharply . Madeline , have you no intelligence ? Has n't it occurred to you that your performance would worry me a little ? MADELINE I suppose it was a nuisance . And on such a busy day . Changing . But if you 're going to worry , Horace is the one you should worry about . Answering his book . Why , he got it all up . He made me ashamed ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And you 're not at all ashamed of what you have done ? MADELINE Ashamed ? Why  --  no . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Then you 'd better be ! A girl who rushes in and assaults an officer ! MADELINE Earnestly explaining it . But , Uncle Felix , I had to stop him . No one else did . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Madeline , I do n't know whether you 're trying to be nave  --  p. 92 MADELINE Angrily . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go home . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I think you will not ! It 's stupid of you not to know this is serious . You could be dismissed from school for what you did . MADELINE Well , I 'm good and ready to be dismissed from any school that would dismiss for that ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST In a new manner  --  quietly , from feeling . Madeline , have you no love for this place ? MADELINE Doggedly , after thinking . Yes , I have . She sits down . And I do n't know why I have . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Certainly it 's not strange . If ever a girl had a background , Morton College is Madeline Fejevary Morton 's background . He too now seated by the table . Do you remember your Grandfather Morton ? MADELINE Not very well . A quality which seems sullenness . I could n't bear to look at him . He shook so . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Turning away , real pain . Oh  --  how cruel . p. 93 MADELINE Surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1ST Not just you . The way it passes  --  to himself so fast it passes . MADELINE I 'm sorry . Troubled . You see , he was too old then  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST His hand up to stop her . I wish I could bring him back for a moment , so you could see what he was before he bitterly shook so . He was a powerful man who was as real as the earth . He was strangely of the earth , as if something went from it to him . Looking at her intently . Queer you should be the one to have no sentiment about him , for you and he  --  sometimes when I 'm with you it 's as if  --  he were near . He had no personal ambition , Madeline . He was ambitious for the earth and its people . I wonder if you can realize what it meant to my father  --  in a strange land , where he might so easily have been misunderstood , pushed down , to find a friend like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Silas was always making them right  --  and as if  --  oh , hardly conscious what he was doing  --  so little it mattered . It was the way he got father , and by that very valuing kept alive what was there to value . Why , he literally laid this country at my father 's feet  --  as if that was what this country was for , as if it made up for the hard early things  --  for the wrong things . p. 94 MADELINE He must really have been a pretty nice old party . No doubt I would have hit it off with him all right . I do n't seem to hit it off with the  --  speeches about him . Somehow I want to say , " Oh , give us a rest . " FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Offended . And that , I presume , is what you want to say to me . MADELINE No , no , I did n't mean you , Uncle . Though hesitatingly I was wondering , how you could think you were talking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean  --  my side ? MADELINE Oh , I do n't  --  exactly . That 's nice about him being  --  of the earth . Sometimes when I 'm out for a tramp  --  way off by myself  --  yes , I know . And I wonder if that does n't explain his feeling about the Indians . Father told me how grandfather took it to heart about the Indians . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST He felt it as you 'd feel it if it were your brother . So he must give his choicest land to the thing we might become . " Then maybe I can lie under the same sod with the red boys and not be ashamed . " Madeline nods , appreciatively . MADELINE Yes , that 's really  --  all right . p. 95 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Irritated by what seems charily stated approval . " All right ! " Well , I am not willing to let this man 's name pass from our time . And it seems rather bitter that Silas Morton 's granddaughter should be the one to stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not standing in your way . Of course I would n't do that . I  --  rather bashfully I love the Hill . I was thinking about it in jail . I got fuddled on direction in there , so I asked the woman who hung around which way was College Hill . " Right through there , " she said . A blank wall . I sat and looked through that wall  --  long time . She looks front , again looking through that blank wall . It was all  --  kind of funny . Then later she came and told me you were out there , and I thought it was corking of you to come and tell them they could n't put that over on College Hill . And I know Bakhshish will appreciate it too . I wonder where he went . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Went ? I fancy he wo n't go much of anywhere tonight . MADELINE What do you mean ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Why , he 's held for his hearing , of course . MADELINE You mean  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 96 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Certainly . MADELINE Rising . Then I 'll have to go and get him ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Madeline , do n't be so absurd . You do n't get people out of jail by stopping in and calling for them . MADELINE But you got me . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Because of years of influence . At that , it was n't simple . Things of this nature are pretty serious nowadays . It was only your ignorance got you out . MADELINE I do seem ignorant . While you were fixing it up for me , why did n't you arrange for him too ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Because I am not in the business of getting foreign revolutionists out of jail . MADELINE But he did n't do as much as I did . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It is n't what he did . It 's what he is . We do n't want him here . MADELINE Well I guess I 'm not for that ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST May I ask why you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are strangers p. 97 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Well they 're the wrong kind of strangers . MADELINE Is it true that the Hindu who was here last year is to be deported ? Is America going to turn him over to the government he fought ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I have an idea they will all be deported . I 'm not so sorry this thing happened . It will get them into the courts  --  and I do n't think they have money to fight . MADELINE Giving it clean and straight . Gee , I think that 's rotten ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Quite likely your inelegance will not affect it one way or the other . MADELINE She has taken her seat again , is thinking it out . I 'm twenty-one next Tuesday . Is n't it on my twenty-first birthday I get that money Grandfather Morton left me ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST What are you driving at ? MADELINE Simply . They can have my money . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Are you crazy ? What are these people to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world who came here believing in us , drawn from the far side of the world by things we say about ourselves . . Well , I 'm going to pretend  --  just for fun  --  that the things we say about ourselves are true . So if you 'll  --  arrange so I can get it , Uncle Felix , as soon as it 's mine . p. 98 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And this is what you say to me at the close of my years of trusteeship ! If you could know how I 've nursed that little legacy along  --  until now it is  --  Breaking off in anger . I shall not permit you to destroy yourself ! MADELINE Quietly . I do n't see how you can keep me from " destroying myself . " FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Looking at her , seeing that this may be true . In genuine amazement , and hurt . Why  --  but it 's incredible . Have I  --  has my house  --  been nothing to you all these years ? MADELINE I 've had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been  --  very gay for me  --  without you all  --  though Horace gets my goat ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST And does your Aunt Isabel  --  " get your goat ? MADELINE I love auntie . Rather re&amp;sgrave ; entfully . You know that . What has that got to do with it ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST So you are going to use Silas Morton 's money to knife his college . MADELINE Oh , Uncle Felix , that 's silly . p. 99 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST It 's a long way from silly . You know a little about what I 'm trying to do  --  this appropriation that would assure our future . If Silas Morton 's granddaughter casts in her lot with revolutionists , Morton College will get no help from the state . Do you know enough about what you are doing to assume this responsibility ? MADELINE I am not " casting in my lot with revolutionists . " If it 's true , as you say , that you have to have money in order to get justice  --  FELIX FEJEVARY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , Uncle Felix . You said so . And if it 's true that these strangers in our country are going to be abused because they 're poor ,  --  what else could I do with my money and not feel like a skunk ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Trying a different tack , laughing . Oh , you 're a romantic girl , Madeline  --  skunk and all . Rather nice , at that . But the thing is perfectly fantastic , from every standpoint . You speak as if you had millions . And if you did , it would n't matter , not really . You are going against the spirit of this country ; with or without money , that ca n't be done . Take a man like Professor Holden . He 's radical in his sympathies  --  but does he run out and club the police ? p. 100 MADELINE In a smoldering way . I thought America was a democracy . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST We have just fought a great war for democracy . MADELINE Well , is that any reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you would have a little emotion about the war  --  about America  --  when you consider where your brother is . MADELINE Fred had  --  all kinds of reasons for going to France . He wanted a trip . Answering his exclamation . Why he said so . Heavens , Fred did n't make speeches about himself . Wanted to see Paris  --  poor kid , he never did see Paris . Wanted to be with a lot of fellows  --  knock the Kaiser 's block off  --  end war , get a French girl . It was all mixed up  --  the way things are . But Fred was a pretty decent sort . I 'll say so . He had such kind , honest eyes . This has somehow said itself ; her own eyes close and what her shut eyes see makes feeling hot . One thing I do know ! Fred never went over the top and out to back up the argument you 're making now ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Stiffly . Very well , I will discontinue the argument I 'm making now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty serious things . The regret of having stood in the way of Morton College  --  his voice falling the horror of having driven your father insane . p. 101 MADELINE What ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST One more thing would do it . Just the other day I was talking with Professor Holden about your father . His idea of him relates back to the pioneer life  --  another price paid for this country . The lives back of him were too hard . Your greatgrandmother Morton  --  the first white woman in this region  --  she dared too much , was too lonely , feared and bore too much . They did it , for the task gave them a courage for the task . But it  --  left a scar . MADELINE And father is that  --  can hardly say it  --  scar . Fighting the idea . But Grandfather Morton was not like that . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No ; he had the vision of the future ; he was robust with feeling for others . Gently . But Holden feels your father is the  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  excludes all else  --  as if unable to free himself from their old battle with the earth . MADELINE Almost crying . I think it 's pretty terrible to  --  wish all that on poor father . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Well , my dear child , it 's life has " wished it on him . " It 's just one other way of paying the price for this country . We need n't get it for nothing . I feel that all our chivalry should go to your father in his  --  heritage of loneliness . p. 102 MADELINE Father could n't always have been  --  dwarfed . Mother would n't have cared for him if he had always been  --  like that . FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST No , if he could have had love to live in . But no endurance for losing it . Too much had been endured just before life got to him . MADELINE Do you know , Uncle Felix  --  I 'm afraid that 's true ? He nods . Sometimes when I 'm with father , I feel those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ,  --  feel them as you 'd feel the cold . And now that it 's different  --  easier  --  he ca n't come into the world that 's been earned . Oh , I wish I could help him ! As they sit there together , now for the first time really together , there is a shrill shout of derision outside . MADELINE What 's that ? A whistled call . Horace ! That 's Horace 's call . That 's for his gang . Are they going to start something now that will get Atma in jail ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST More likely he 's trying to start something . They are both listening intently . I do n't think our boys will stand much more . A scoffing whoop . Madeline springs to the window ; he reaches in ahead and holds it . p. 103 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST This window stays closed . She starts to go away , he takes hold of her . MADELINE You think you can keep me in here ? FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Listen , Madeline  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get in trouble a second time , I ca n't make it right for you . MADELINE You need n't ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST You do n't know what it means . These things are not child 's play  --  not today . You could get twenty years in prison for things you 'll say if you rush out there now . She laughs . You laugh because you 're ignorant . Do you know that in America today there are women in our prisons for saying no more than you 've said here to me ! MADELINE Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST I ? Ashamed of myself ? MADELINE Yes ! Are n't you an American ? A whistle . Is n't that a policeman 's whistle ? Are they coming back ? Are they hanging around here to  --  Pulling away from her uncle as he turns to look , she jumps up in the deep sill and throws open the window . Calling down . Here  --  Officer  --  You  --  Let that boy alone ! p. 104 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holden . Professor Holden  --  here  --  quick ! VOICE Coming up from below , outside . Who says so ? MADELINE I say so ! VOICE And who are you talking for ? MADELINE I am talking for Morton College ! FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Returning  --  followed , reluctantly , by Holden . Indeed you are not . Close that window or you 'll be expelled from Morton College . Sounds of a growing crowd outside . VOICE Did n't I see you at the station ? MADELINE Sure you saw me at the station . And you 'll see me there again , if you come bullying around here . You 're not what this place is for ! Her uncle comes up behind , right , and tries to close the window  --  she holds it out . My grandfather gave this hill to Morton College  --  a place where anybody  --  from any land  --  can come and say what he believes to be true ! Why you poor simp  --  this is America ! Beat it from here ! Atma ! Do n't let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to  --  Oh , let me down there ! Springs down , would go off right , her uncle spreads out his arms to block that passage . She turns to go the other way . p. 105 FELIX FEJEVARY , 1ST Holden ! Bring her to her senses . Stand there . Holden has not moved from the place he entered , left , and so blocks the doorway . Do n't let her pass . Shouts of derision outside . MADELINE You think you can keep me in here  --  with that going on out there ? Moves nearer Holden , stands there before him , taut , looking him straight in the eye . After a moment , slowly , as one compelled , he steps aside for her to pass . Sound of her running footsteps . The two men 's eyes meet . A door slams . Curtain @x Scene : At the Morton place , the same room in which Silas Morton told his friend Felix Fejevary of his plan for the hill . The room has not altogether changed since that day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race is in its old place . One of the old chairs is there , the other two are modern chairs . In a corner is the rocker in which Grandmother Morton sat . This is early afternoon , a week after the events of Act Two . Madeline is sitting at the table , in her hand a torn wrinkled piece of brown paper  --  peering at writing almost too fine to read . After a moment her hand goes out to a beautiful dish on the table  --  on old dish of colored Hungarian glass . She is about to take something from this , but instead lets her hand rest an instant on the dish itself . Then turns and through the open door looks out at the hill , sitting where her Grandfather Morton sat when he looked out at the hill . Her father , Ira Morton , appears outside , walking past the window , left . He enters carrying a grain sack , partly filled . He seems hardly aware of Madeline , but taking a chair near the door , turned from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of corn . As he is bent over them , examining in a shrewd , greedy way , Madeline looks at that lean , tormented , rather desperate profile , the look of one confirming a thing she fears . Then takes up her piece of paper . MADELINE Do you remember Fred Jordan , father ? Friend of our Fred  --  and of mine ? p. 107 IRA Not wanting to take his mind from the corn . No . I do n't remember him . His voice has that timbre of one not related to others . MADELINE He 's in prison now . IRA Well , I ca n't help that . After taking out another ear . This is the best corn I ever had . He says it gloatingly , to himself . MADELINE He got this letter out to me  --  written on this scrap of paper . They do n't give him paper . Peering . Written so fine I can hardly read it . He 's in what they call " the hole , " father  --  a punishment cell . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet at one end , three feet at the other end , and six feet long . He 'd been there ten days when he wrote this . He gets two slices of bread a day ; he gets water ; that 's all he gets . This because he balled the deputy warden out for chaining another prisoner up by the wrists . IRA Well , he 'd better a-minded his own business . And you better mind yours . I 've got no money to spend in the courts . With excitement . I 'll not mortgage this farm ! It 's been clear since the day my father 's father got it from the government  --  and it stays clear  --  till I 'm gone . It grows the best corn in the state  --  best corn in the Mississippi Valley . Not for anything  --  you hear me ?  --  would I mortgage this farm my father handed down to me. p. 108 MADELINE Hurt . Well , father , I 'm not asking you to . IRA Then go and see your Uncle Felix . Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you say you 're sorry . MADELINE I 'll not go to Uncle Felix IRA Who will you go to then ? Pause . Who will help you then ? Again he waits . You come before this United States Commissioner with no one behind you , he 'll hold you for the grand jury . Judge Watkins told Felix there 's not a doubt of it . You know what that means ? It means you 're on your way to a cell . Nice thing for a Morton , people who 've had their own land since we got it from the Indians . What 's the matter with your uncle ? Ai n't he always been good to you ? I 'd like to know what things would ' a been for you without Felix and Isabel and all their friends . You want to think a little . You like good times too well to throw all that away . MADELINE I do like good times . So does Fred Jordan like good times . Smooths the wrinkled paper . I do n't know anybody  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he does . She tries to look out , but can not ; sits very still , seeing what it is pain to see . Rises , goes to that corner closet , the same one from which Silas Morton took the deed to the hill . She gets a yard stick , looks in a box and finds a piece of chalk . On the floor she marks off Fred Jordan 's cell . Slowly , at the end left unchalked , as for a door , she goes in . Her hand goes up , as against a wall ; looks at her other hand , sees it is out too far , brings it in , giving herself the width of the cell . Walks its length , halts , looks up . And one window  --  too high up to see out . In the moment she stands there , she is in that cell ; she is all the people who are in those cells . Emil Johnson appears from outside ; he is the young man brought up on a farm , a crudely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell door , and around it . Hello , Emil . JOHNSON How are you , Madeline ? How do , Mr. Morton . Ira barely nods and does not turn . In an excited manner he begins gathering up the corn he has taken from the sack . Emil turns back to Madeline . Well , I 'm just from the courthouse . Looks like you and I might take a ride together , Madeline . You come before the Commissioner at four . IRA What have you got to do with it ? MADELINE Oh , Emil has a courthouse job now , father . He 's part of the law . IRA Well , he 's not going to take you to the law ! Anybody else  --  not Emil Johnson ! MADELINE Astonished  --  and gently , to make up for his rudeness . Why  --  father , why not Emil ? Since I 'm going , I think it 's nice to go in with someone I know  --  with a neighbor like Emil . IRA If this is what he lived for ! If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the kernels drop off . Madeline and Emil look at one another in bewilderment . p. 110 JOHNSON It 's too bad anybody has to take Madeline in . I should think your uncle could fix it up . Low . And with your father taking it like this  --  To help Ira . That 's fine corn , Mr. Morton . My corn 's getting better all the time , but I 'd like to get some of this for seed . IRA Rising and turning on him . You get my corn ? I raise this corn for you ? Not to them  --  his mind now going where it is shut off from any other mind . If I could make the wind stand still ! I want to turn the wind around . MADELINE Going to him . Why  --  father . I do n't understand at all . IRA Do n't understand . Nobody understands . A curse with a sob in it . God damn the wind ! Sits down , his back to them . JOHNSON After a silence . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira , who is holding the sack of corn shut , as if someone may take it . Too bad  --  Stopped by a sign from Madeline , not to speak of it . Well , I was saying , I have to go on to Beard 's Crossing . I 'll stop for you on my way back . Confidentially . Could n't you telephone your uncle ? He could do something . You do n't know what you 're going up against . You heard what the Hindus got , I suppose . p. 111 MADELINE No . I have n't seen anyone today . JOHNSON They 're held for the grand jury . They 're locked up now . No bail for them . I 've got the inside dope about them . They 're going to get what this country can hand ' em ; then after we 've given them a nice little taste of prison life in America , they 're going to be sent back home  --  to see what India can treat them to . MADELINE Why are you so pleased about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  I 'm just telling you . Guess you do n't know much about the Espionage Act or you 'd go and make a little friendly call on your uncle . When your case comes to trial  --  and Judge Lenon maybe on the bench  --  Whistles . He 's one fiend for Americanism . But if your uncle was to tell the right parties that you 're just a girl , and did n't realize what you were saying  --  MADELINE I did realize what I was saying , and every word you 've just said makes me know I meant what I said . I said if this was what our country has come to then I 'm not for our country . I said that  --  and a-plenty more  --  and I 'll say it again ! JOHNSON Well  --  gee , you do n't know what it means . p. 112 MADELINE I do know what it means , but it means not being a coward . JOHNSON Oh , well  --  Lord , you ca n't say everything you think . If everybody did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . MADELINE Once in a while you have to say what you think  --  or hate yourself . JOHNSON With a grin . Then hate yourself . MADELINE Smiling too . No thank you ; it spoils my fun . JOHNSON Well , look-a-here , Madeline , are n't you spoiling your fun now ? You 're a girl likes to be out . Ai n't I seen you from our place , with this one and that one , sometimes all by yourself , strikin ' out over the country as if you was crazy about it ? How 'd you like to be where you could n't even see out ? MADELINE A step nearer the cell . There ought n't to be such places . JOHNSON Oh , well  --  Jesus , if you 're going to talk about that  --  ! You ca n't change the way things are . MADELINE Quietly . Why ca n't I ? p. 113 JOHNSON Well , say , who do you think you are ? MADELINE I think I 'm an American . And for that reason I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! America 'll lock you up for your pains . MADELINE All right . If it 's come to that , maybe I 'd rather be a locked up American than a free American . JOHNSON I do n't think you 'd like the place , Madeline . There 's not much tennis played there . Jesus  --  what 's Hindus ? MADELINE You are n't really asking Jesus , are you , Emil ? Smiles . You might n't like his answer . JOHNSON From the door . Take a tip . Telephone your uncle . He goes . IRA Not looking at her . There might be a fine , and they 'd come down on me and take my land . MADELINE Oh , no , father , I think not . Anyway , I have a little money of my own . Grandfather Morton left me something . Have you forgotten that ? IRA No . No , I know he left you something . The words seem to bother him . I know he left you something . p. 114 MADELINE I get it today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm twenty-one . IRA Your birthday ? Twenty-one ? In pain . Was that twenty-one years ago ? It is not to his daughter this has turned him . MADELINE It 's the first birthday I can remember that I have n't had a party . IRA It was your Aunt Isabel gave you your parties MADELINE Yes . IRA Well , you see now . MADELINE Stoutly . Oh , well , I do n't need a party . I 'm grown up now . She reaches out for the old Hungarian dish on the table ; holding it , she looks to her father , whose back is still turned . Her face tender , she is about to speak when he speaks . IRA Grown up now  --  and going off and leaving me alone . You too  --  the last one . And  --  what for ? Turning , looking around the room as for those long gone . There used to be so many in this house . My grandmother . She sat there . Pointing to the place near the open door . Fine days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd sit there  --  tell me stories of the Indians . Father . It was n't ever lonely where father was . Then Madeline Fejevary  --  my Madeline came to this house . Lived with me in this house . Then one day she  --  walked out of this house . Through that door  --  through the field  --  out of this house . Bitter silence . Then Fred  --  out of this house . Now you . With Emil Johnson ! Insanely , and almost with relief at leaving things more sane . Do n't let him touch my corn . If he touches one kernel of this corn ! With the suspicion of the tormented mind . I wonder where he went ? How do I know he went where he said he was going ? Getting up . I du n no as that south bin 's locked . p. 115 MADELINE Oh  --  father ! IRA I 'll find out . How do I know what he 's doing ? He goes out , turning left . Madeline goes to the window and looks after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , she turns and finds her Aunt Isabel , who has appeared from right . Goes swiftly to her , hands out . MADELINE Oh , auntie  --  I 'm glad you came ! It 's my birthday , and I 'm  --  lonely . AUNT ISABEL You dear little girl ! Again giving her a hug , which Madeline returns , lovingly . Do n't I know it 's your birthday ? Do n't think that day will ever get by while your Aunt Isabel 's around . Just see what 's here for your birthday . Hands her the package she is carrying . MADELINE With a gasp  --  suspecting from its shape . Oh ! Her face aglow . Why  --  is it ? AUNT ISABEL Laughing affectionately . Foolish child , open it and see . Madeline loosens the paper and pulls out a tennis racket. p. 116 MADELINE Excited , and moved . Oh , Aunt Isabel !  --  that was dear of you . I should n't have thought you 'd  --  quite do that . AUNT ISABEL I could n't imagine Madeline without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But be a little careful of it , Madeline . It 's meant for tennis balls . They laugh together . MADELINE Making a return with it . It 's a peach . Changing . Wonder where I 'll play now . AUNT ISABEL Why you 'll play on the courts at Morton College . Who has a better right ? MADELINE Oh , I do n't know . It 's pretty much balled up , is n't it ? AUNT ISABEL Yes ; we 'll have to get it straightened out . Gently . It was really dreadful of you , Madeline , to rush out a second time . It is n't as if they were people who were anything to you . MADELINE But , auntie , they are something to me . AUNT ISABEL Oh , dear , that 's what Horace said . p. 117 MADELINE What 's what Horace said ? AUNT ISABEL That you must have a case on one of them . MADELINE That 's what Horace would say . That makes me sore ! AUNT ISABEL I 'm sorry I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADELINE He 's a  --  AUNT ISABEL Stopping it with her hand . No , he is n't . He 's a headstrong boy , but a very loving one . He 's dear with me , Madeline . MADELINE Yes . You are good to each other . Her eyes are drawn to the cell . AUNT ISABEL Of course we are . We 'd be a pretty poor sort if we were n't . And these are days when we have to stand together  --  all of us who are the same kind of people must stand together because the thing that makes us the same kind of people is threatened . MADELINE Do n't you think we 're rather threatening it ourselves , auntie ? AUNT ISABEL Why , no , we 're fighting for it . MADELINE Fighting for what ? AUNT ISABEL For Americanism ; for  --  democracy . p. 118 MADELINE Horace is fighting for it ? AUNT ISABEL Well , Horace does go at it as if it were a football game , but his heart 's in the right place . MADELINE Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place . AUNT ISABEL In what place ? MADELINE Where Horace 's heart is . AUNT ISABEL It 's too bad you and Horace quarrel . But you and I do n't quarrel , Madeline . MADELINE Again drawn to the cell . No . You and I do n't quarrel . She is troubled . AUNT ISABEL Funny child ! Do you want us to ? Madeline turns , laughing a little , takes the dish from the table , hold it out to her aunt . MADELINE Have some fudge , auntie . AUNT ISABEL Taking the dish . Do you use them ?  --  the old Hungarian dishes ? Laughingly . I 'm not allowed to  --  your uncle is so choice of the few pieces we have . And here are you with fudge in one of them . p. 119 MADELINE I made the fudge because  --  oh , I do n't know , I had to do something to celebrate my birthday . AUNT ISABEL Under her breath . Dearie ! MADELINE And then that did n't seem to  --  make a birthday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top shelf , and I remembered that it was my mother 's . It was nice to get it down and use it  --  almost as if mother was giving me a birthday present . AUNT ISABEL And how she would love to give you a birthday present . MADELINE It was her mother 's , I suppose , and they brought it from Hungary . AUNT ISABEL Yes . They brought only a very few things with them , and left  --  oh so many beautiful ones behind . MADELINE Quietly . Rather nice of them , was n't it ? Her aunt waits inquiringly . To leave their own beautiful things  --  their own beautiful life behind  --  simply because they believed life should be more beautiful for more people . AUNT ISABEL With constraint . Yes . Gayly turning it . Well , now , as to the birthday . What do you suppose Sarah is doing this instant ? Putting red frosting on white frosting . Writing it with her finger . Madeline . And what do you suppose Horace is doing ? This a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one to grow on . Big birthday cake . Party tonight . p. 120 MADELINE But , auntie , I do n't see how I can be there . AUNT ISABEL Listen , dear . Now , we 've got to use our wits and all pull together . Of course . we 'd do anything in the world rather than see you  --  left to outsiders . I 've never seen your uncle as worried , and  --  truly , Madeline , as sad . Oh , my dear , it 's these human things that count ! What would life be without the love we have for each other ? MADELINE The love we have for each other ? AUNT ISABEL Why , yes , dearest . Do n't turn away from me , Madeline . Do n't  --  do n't be strange . I wonder if you realize how your uncle has worked to have life a happy thing for all of us ? Be a little generous to him . He 's had this great burden of bringing something from another day on into this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's done it as best he could . It will hurt him as nothing has ever hurt him if you now undo that work of his life . Truly , dear , do you feel you know enough about it to do that ? Another thing : people are a little absurd out of their own places . We need to be held in our relationships  --  against our background  --  or we are  --  I do n't know  --  grotesque . Come now , Madeline , where 's your sense of humor ? Is n't it a little absurd for you to leave home over India 's form of government ? p. 121 MADELINE It 's not India . It 's America . A sense of humor is nothing to hide behind ! AUNT ISABEL With a laugh . I knew I would n't be a success at world affairs  --  better leave that to Professor Holden . A quick keen look from Madeline . They 've driven on to the river  --  they 'll be back for me , and then he wants to stop in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a further ride . I 'm worried about her . She does n't gain strength at all since her operation . I 'm going to try keeping her out in the air all I can . MADELINE It 's dreadful about families ! AUNT ISABEL Dreadful ? Professor Holden 's devotion to his wife is one of the most beautiful things I 've ever seen . MADELINE And is that all you see it in ? AUNT ISABEL You mean the  --  responsibility it brings ? Oh , well  --  that 's what life is . Doing for one another . Sacrificing for one another . MADELINE I hope I never have a family . AUNT ISABEL Well , I hope you do . You 'll miss the best of life if you do n't . Anyway , you have a family . Where is your father ? p. 122 MADELINE I do n't know . AUNT ISABEL I 'd like to see him . MADELINE There 's no use seeing him today . AUNT ISABEL He 's  --  ? MADELINE Strange  --  shut in  --  afraid something 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much has been taken from him . And now you . Do n't hurt him again , Madeline . He ca n't bear it . You see what it does to him . MADELINE He has  --  the wrong idea about things . AUNT ISABEL " The wrong idea ! " Oh , my child  --  that 's awfully young and hard . It 's so much deeper than that . Life has made him into something  --  something he ca n't escape . MADELINE With what seems sullenness . Well , I do n't want to be made into that thing . AUNT ISABEL Of course not . But you want to help him , do n't you ? Now dear  --  about your birthday party  --  MADELINE The United States Commissioner is giving me my birthday party . AUNT ISABEL Well , he 'll have to put his party off . Your uncle has been thinking it all out . We 're to go to his office and you 'll have a talk with him and with Judge Watkins . He 's off the state supreme bench now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle he will be your lawyer . You do n't know how relieved we are at this , for Judge Watkins can do  --  anything he wants to do , practically . Then you and I will go on home and call up some of the crowd to come in and dance tonight . We have some beautiful new records . There 's a Hungarian waltz  --  p. 123 MADELINE And what 's the price of all this , auntie ? AUNT ISABEL The  --  Oh , you mean  --  Why simply say you felt sorry for the Hindu students because they seemed rather alone ; that you had n't realized  --  what they were , had n't thought out what you were saying  --  MADELINE And that I 'm sorry and will never do it again . AUNT ISABEL I do n't know that you need say that . It would be gracious , I think , to indicate it . MADELINE I 'm sorry you  --  had the cake made . I suppose you can eat it , anyway . I turning away  --  ca n't eat it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt her , Madeline goes to her aunt . MADELINE Auntie , dear ! I 'm sorry  --  if I hurt your feelings . AUNT ISABEL Quick to hold out a loving hand , laughing a little . They 've been good birthday cakes , have n't they , Madeeline ? MADELINE She now trying not to cry . I do n't know  --  what I 'd have done without them . Do n't know  --  what I will do without them . I do n't  --  see it . p. 124 AUNT ISABEL Do n't try to . Please do n't see it ! Just let me go on helping you . That 's all I ask . She draws Madeline to her . Ah , dearie , I held you when you were a little baby without your mother . All those years count for something , Madeline . There 's just nothing to life if years of love do n't count for something . Listening . I think I hear them . And here are we , weeping like two idiots . Madeline brushes away tears , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Holden was hoping you 'd take a tramp with him . Would n't that do you good ? Anyway , a talk with him will be nice . I know he admires you immensely , and really  --  perhaps I should n't let you know this  --  sympathizes with your feeling . So I think his maturer way of looking at things will show you just the adjustment you need to become a really big and useful person . There 's so much to be done in the world , Madeline . Of course we ought to make it a better world . In a manner of agreement with Madeline . I feel very strongly about all that . Perhaps we can do some things together . I 'd love that . Do n't think I 'm hopeless ! Way down deep we have the same feeling . Yes , here 's Professor Holden . Holden comes in . He seems older . p. 125 PROFESSOR HOLDEN And how are you , Madeline ? Holding out his hand . MADELINE I 'm  --  all right . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Many happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The birthday . AUNT ISABEL And did you have a nice look up the river ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN I never saw this country as lovely as it is today . Mary is just drinking it in . AUNT ISABEL You do n't think the further ride will be too much ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN Oh , no  --  not in that car . AUNT ISABEL Then we 'll go on  --  perhaps as far as Laughing Creek . If you two decide on a tramp  --  take that road and we 'll pick you up . Smiling warmly she goes out . PROFESSOR HOLDEN How good she is . MADELINE Yes . That 's just the trouble . PROFESSOR HOLDEN With difficulty getting past this . How about a little tramp ? There 'll never be another such day . p. 126 MADELINE I used to tramp with Fred Jordan . This is where he is now . Stepping inside the cell . He does n't even see out . PROFESSOR HOLDEN It 's all wrong that he should be where he is . But for you to stay indoors wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him , but  --  today  --  I ca n't go out . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I 'm sorry , my child . When this sense of wrongs done first comes down upon one , it does crush . MADELINE And later you get used to it and do n't care . PROFESSOR HOLDEN You care . You try not to destroy yourself needlessly . He turns from her look . MADELINE Play safe . PROFESSOR HOLDEN If it 's playing safe it 's that one you love more than yourself be safe . It would be a luxury to  --  destroy one 's self . MADELINE That sounds like Uncle Felix . Seeing she has hurt him , she goes over and sits across from him at the table . I 'm sorry . I say the wrong things today . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I do n't know that you do . p. 127 MADELINE But is n't uncle funny ? His left mind does n't know what his right mind is doing . He has to think of himself as a person of sentiment  --  idealism , and  --  quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with it . The war must have been a godsend to people who were in danger of getting on to themselves . But I should think you could fool all of yourself all the time . PROFESSOR HOLDEN You do n't . He is rubbing his hand on the table . MADELINE Grandfather Morton made this table . I suppose he and Grandfather Fejevary used to sit here and talk  --  they were great old pals . Slowly Holden turns and looks out at the hill . Yes . How beautiful the hill must have been  --  before there was a college there . He looks away from the hill . Did you know Grandfather Morton ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN Yes , I knew him . Speaking of it against his will . I had a wonderful talk with him once ; about Greece  --  and the cornfields , and life . MADELINE I 'd like to have been a pioneer ! Some ways they had it fierce , but think of the fun they had ! A whole big land to open up ! A big new life to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Why did so much get shut out ? Just a little way back  --  anything might have been . What happened ? p. 128 PROFESSOR HOLDEN Speaking with difficulty . It got  --  set too soon . MADELINE All of her mind open , trying to know . And why did it ? Prosperous , I suppose . That seems to set things  --  set them in fear . Silas Morton was n't afraid of Felix Fejevary , the Hungarian revolutionist . He laid this country at that refugee 's feet ! That 's what Uncle Felix says himself  --  with the left half of his mind . Now  --  the Hindu revolutionists  --  ! Pause . I took a walk late yesterday afternoon . Night came , and for some reason I thought of how many nights have come  --  nights the earth has known long before we knew the earth . The moon came up and I thought of how moonlight made this country beautiful before any man knew that moonlight was beautiful . It gave me a feeling of coming from something a long way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not here . Moving . We seem here , now , in America , to have forgotton we 're moving . Think it 's just us  --  just now . Of course , that would make us afraid , and  --  ridiculous . Her father comes in . IRA Your Aunt Isabel  --  did she go away  --  and leave you ? MADELINE She 's coming back . p. 129 IRA For you ? MADELINE She  --  wants me to go with her . This is Professor Holden , father . PROFESSOR HOLDEN How do you do , Mr. Morton ? IRA Nods , not noticing Holden 's offered hand . How ' do . When is she coming back ? MADELINE Soon . IRA And then you 're going with her ? MADELINE I  --  do n't know . IRA I say you go with her . You want them all to come down on us ? To Holden . What are you here for ? MADELINE Aunt Isabel brought Professor Holden , father . IRA Oh . Then you  --  you tell her what to do . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at left . MADELINE Sadly , after a silence . Father 's like something touched by an early frost . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Yes . Seeing his opening and forcing himself to take it . But do you know , Madeline , there are other ways of that happening  --  " touched by an early frost . " I 've seen it happen to people I know  --  people of fine and daring mind . They do a thing that puts them apart  --  it may be the big , brave thing  --  but the apartness does something to them . I 've seen it many times  --  so many times , I fear for you . You do this thing and you 'll find yourself with people who in many ways you do n't care for at all ; find yourself apart from people who in most ways are your own people . You 're many-sided , Madeline . Moves her tennis racket . I do n't know about it 's all going to one side . I hate to see you , so young , close a door on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you as I know how . I myself am making compromises to stay within . I do n't like it , but there are  --  reasons for doing it . I ca n't see you leave that main body without telling you all it is you are leaving . It 's not a clean-cut case  --  the side of the world or the side of the angels . I hate to see you lose the  --  fullness of life . p. 130 MADELINE A slight start , as she realizes the pause . As one recalled from far . I 'm sorry . I was listening to what you were saying  --  but all the time  --  something else was happening . Grandfather Morton , big and  --  oh , terrible . He was here . And he went to that walled up hole in the ground Rising and pointing down at the chalked cell where they keep Fred Jordan on bread and water because he could n't be a part of nations of men killing each other  --  and Silas Morton  --  only he was all that is back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice tore it open  --  his voice as he cried , " God damn you , this is America ! " Sitting down , as if rallying from a tremendous experience . I 'm sorry  --  it should have happened , while you were speaking . Wo n't you  --  go on ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN That 's a pretty hard thing to go on against . After a moment . I ca n't go on . MADELINE You were thinking of leaving the college , and then  --  decided to stay ? He nods . And you feel there 's more  --  fullness of life for you inside the college than outside ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN No  --  not exactly . Again a pause . It 's very hard for me to talk to you . p. 131 MADELINE Gently . Perhaps we need n't do it . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Something in him forcing him to say it . I 'm staying for financial reasons . MADELINE Kind , but not going to let the truth get away . You do n't think that  --  having to stay within  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the  --  blight of being without ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN I think there is danger to you in  --  so young , becoming alien to society . MADELINE As great as the danger of staying within  --  and becoming like the thing I 'm within ? PROFESSOR HOLDEN You would n't become like it . MADELINE Why would n't I ? That 's what it does to the rest of you . I do n't see it  --  this fullness of life business . I do n't see that Uncle Felix has got it  --  or even Aunt Isabel , and you  --  I think that in buying it you 're losing it . PROFESSOR HOLDEN I do n't think you know what a cruel thing you are saying . MADELINE There must be something pretty rotten about Morton College if you have to sell your soul to stay in it ! p. 132 PROFESSOR HOLDEN You do n't " sell your soul . " You persuade yourself to wait . MADELINE Unable to look at him , as if feeling shame . You have had a talk with Uncle Felix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to pass . PROFESSOR HOLDEN Yes ; and with my wife 's physician . If you sell your soul  --  it 's to love you sell it . MADELINE Low . That 's strange . It 's love that  --  brings life along , and then it 's love  --  holds life back . PROFESSOR HOLDEN And all the time with this effort against hopelessness . Leaving me out of it , I 'd like to see you give yourself a little more chance for detachment . You need a better intellectual equipment if you 're going to fight the world you find yourself in . I think you will count for more if you wait and when you strike , strike more maturely . MADELINE Detachment . Pause . This is one thing they do at that place . She moves to the open door . Chain them up to the bars  --  just like this . In the doorway where her two grandfathers once pledged faith with the dreams of a million years , she raises clasped hands as high as they will go . Eight hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like this one hour then sit down and think about  --  As if tortured by all who have been so tortured , her body begins to give with sobs , arms drop , the last word is a sob detachment . Holden is standing helplessly by when her father comes in. p. 133 IRA Wildly . Do n't cry . No ! Not in this house ! I ca n't  --  Your aunt and uncle will fix it up . The law wo n't take you this time  --  and you wo n't do it again . MADELINE Oh , what does that matter  --  what they do to me ? IRA What you crying about then ? MADELINE It 's  --  the world . It 's  --  IRA The world ? If that 's all you 've got to cry about ! To Holden . Tell her that 's nothing to cry about . What 's the matter with you , Mad'line ? That 's crazy  --  cryin ' about the world ! What good has ever come to this nouse through carin ' about the world ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why is there no one in this house today but me and you ? Where 's your mother ? Where 's your brother ? The world PROFESSOR HOLDEN I think your father would like to talk to you . I 'll go outside  --  walk a little , and come back for you with your aunt . You must let us see you through this , Madeline . You could n't bear the things it would bring you to . I see that now . As he passes her in the doorway his hand rests an instant on her bent head . You 're worth too much to break . p. 134 IRA Turning away . I do n't want to talk to you . What good comes of talking ? In moving , he has stepped near the sack of corn . Takes hold of it . But not with Emil Johnson ! That 's not  --  what your mother died for . MADELINE Father , you must talk to me . What did my mother die for ? No one has ever told me about her  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got a feeling of  --  something from far away . Something from long ago . Rare . Why ca n't Uncle Felix talk about her ? Why ca n't you ? Would n't she want me to know her ? Tell me about her . It 's my birthday and I need my mother . IRA As if afraid he is going to do it . How can you touch  --  what you 've not touched in nineteen years ? Just once  --  in nineteen years  --  and that did no good . MADELINE Try . Even though it hurts . Did n't you used to talk to her ? Well , I 'm her daughter . Talk to me . What has she to do with Emil Johnson ? IRA The pent up thing loosed . What has she to do with him ? She died so he could live . He lives because she 's dead . In anguish . And what is he alongside her ? Yes . Something from far away . Something from long ago . Rare . How 'd you know that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Then she came  --  that ignorant Swede  --  Emil Johnson 's mother  --  running through the cornfield like a crazy woman  --  " Miss Morton ! Miss Morton ! Come help me ! My children are choking ! " Diphtheria they had  --  the whole of ' em  --  but out of this house she ran  --  my Madeline , leaving you  --  her own baby  --  running fast as she could through the cornfield after that immigrant woman . She stumbled in the rough field  --  fell to her knees . That was the last I saw of her . She choked to death in that Swede 's house . They lived . p. 135 MADELINE Going to him . Oh  --  father . Voice rich . But how lovely of her . IRA Lovely ? Lovely to leave you without a mother  --  leave me without her after I 'd had her ? Was n't she worth more than them ? MADELINE Proudly . Yes . She was worth so much that she never stopped to think how much she was worth . IRA Ah , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . And now you cry about the world ! That 's what the world is  --  all coming to nothing . My father used to sit there at the table and talk about the world  --  my father and her father . They thought ' t was all for something  --  that what you were went on into something more than you . That 's the talk I always heard in this house . But it 's just talk . The rare thing that came here was killed by the common thing that came here . Just happens  --  and happens cruel . Look at your brother ! Gone  --  snaps his finger like that . I told him not to go to war . He did n't have to go  --  they 'd been glad enough to have him stay here on the farm . But no ,  --  he must  --  make the world safe for democracy ! Well , you see how safe he made it , do n't you ? Now I 'm alone on the farm and he  --  buried on some Frenchman 's farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope they did n't just  --  tormented. p. 136 MADELINE Oh father  --  of course not . I know they did . IRA How do you know ? What do they care  --  once they got him ? He talked about the world  --  better world  --  end war . Now he 's in his grave  --  I hope he is  --  and look at the front page of the paper ! No such thing  --  war to end war ! MADELINE But he thought there was , father . Fred believed that  --  so what else could he do ? IRA He could ' a minded his own business . MADELINE No  --  oh , no . It was fine of him to give his life to what he believed should be . IRA The light in his eyes as he talked of it , now  --  eyes gone  --  and the world he died for all hate and war . Waste . Waste . Nothin ' but waste  --  the life of this house . Why folks today 'd laugh to hear my father talk . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make us a better people . What was his word ? Waits . . Aspiration . Says it as if it is a far-off thing . Well , look at your friend young Jordan . Kicked from the college to prison for ideas of a better world . Laughs . His " aspiration " puts him in a hole on bread and water ! So  --  mind your own business , that 's all that 's so in this country . Constantly tormented anew . Oh I told your brother all that  --  the night I tried to keep him . Told him about his mother  --  to show what come of running to other folks . And he said  --  standing right there  --  pointing eyes all bright , he said , " Golly , I think that 's great ! " And then he  --  walked out of this house . Fear takes him . Madeline ! She stoops over him , her arm around him . Do n't you leave me  --  all alone in this house  --  where so many was once . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? It wo n't be long . After a little I 'll be dead  --  or crazy  --  or something . But not here alone  --  where so many was once . p. 137 MADELINE Oh  --  father . I do n't know what to do . IRA Nothing stays at home . Not even the corn stays at home . If only the wind would n't blow ! Why ca n't I have my field to myself ? Why ca n't I keep what 's mine ? All these years I 've worked to make it better . I wanted it to be  --  the most that it could be . My father used to talk about the Indians  --  how our land was their land , and how we must be more than them . He had his own ideas of bein ' more  --  well , what 's that come to ? The Indians lived happier than we  --  wars , strikes , prisons . But I 've made the corn more ! This land that was once Indian maize now grows corn  --  I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see them side by side !  --  their Indian maize , my corn . And how 'd I get it ? Ah , by thinkin '  --  always tryin ' , changin ' , carin ' . Plant this corn by that corn , and the pollen blows from corn to corn  --  the golden dust it blows , in the sunshine and of nights  --  blows from corn to corn like a  --  the word hurts gift . No , you do n't understand it , but proudly corn do n't stay what it is ! You can make it anything  --  according to what you do , ' cording to the corn it 's alongside . Changing . But that 's it . I want it to stay in my field . It goes away . The prevailin ' wind takes it on to the Johnsons  --  them Swedes that took my Madeline ! I hear it ! Oh nights when I ca n't help myself  --  and in the sunshine I can see it  --  pollen  --  soft golden dust to make new life  --  goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what 's makin ' their corn better ! I want my field to myself . What 'd I work all my life for ? Work that 's had to take the place o ' what I lost  --  is that to go to Emil Johnson ? No ! The wind shall stand still ! I 'll make it . I 'll find a way . Let me alone and I  --  I 'll think it out . Let me alone , I say . A mind burned to one idea , with greedy haste he shuts himself in the room at left . Madeline has been standing there as if mist is parting and letting her see . And as the vision grows power grows in her . She is thus flooded with richer life when her aunt and Professor Holden come back . Feeling something new , for a moment they do not speak . p. 138 AUNT ISABEL Ready , dear ? It 's time for us to go now MADELINE With the quiet of plentitude . I 'm going in with Emil Johnson . AUNT ISABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with us . MADELINE No . I have to be  --  the most I can be . I want the wind to have something to carry . AUNT ISABEL After a look at Professor Holden , who is looking intensely at Madeline . I do n't understand . MADELINE The world is all a  --  moving field . Her hands move , voice too is as of a moving field . Nothing is to itself . If America thinks so  --  America is like father . I do n't feel alone any more . The wind has come through  --  wind rich from lives now gone . Grandfather Fejevary , gift from a field far off . Silas Morton . No , not alone any more . And afraid ? I 'm not even afraid of being absurd ! AUNT ISABEL But Madeline  --  you 're leaving your father ? MADELINE After thinking it out . I 'm not leaving  --  what 's greater in him than he knows . p. 139 AUNT ISABEL You 're leaving Morton College ? MADELINE That runt on a high hill ? Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can one day lie under the same sod with him , and not be ashamed . Though I must tell you a little laugh under the sod is my idea of no place to be . I want to be a long time  --  where the wind blows . AUNT ISABEL Who is trying not to cry . I 'm afraid it wo n't blow in prison , dear . MADELINE I do n't know . Might be the only place it would blow . Emil passes the window , hesitates at the door . I 'll be ready in just a moment , Emil . He waits outside . AUNT ISABEL Madeline , I did n't tell you  --  I hoped it would n't be necessary , but your uncle said  --  if you refused to do it his way , he could do absolutely nothing for you , not even  --  bail . MADELINE Of course not . I would n't expect him to . AUNT ISABEL He feels so deeply about these things  --  America  --  loyalty  --  he said if you did n't come with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between you and me. p. 140 MADELINE I 'm sorry , auntie . You know how I love you . And her voice tells it . But father has been telling me about the corn . It gives itself away all the time  --  the best corn a gift to other corn . What you are  --  that does n't stay with you . Then  --  not with assurance , but feeling her way. be the most you can be , so life will be more because you were . Freed by the truth she has found Oh  --  do that ! Why do we three go apart ? Professor Holden , his beautiful trained mind ; Aunt Isabel  --  her beautiful love , love that could save the world if only you 'd  --  throw it to the winds . Moving nearer Holden , hands out to him . Why do  --  Seeing it is not to be , she turns away . Low , with sorrow for that great beauty lost . Oh , have we brought mind , have we brought heart , up to this place  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLDEN Unable to bear more . I think we  --  must go . Going to Madeline , holding out his hand and speaking from his sterile life to her fullness of life . Good-bye , Madeline . Good luck . MADELINE Goodbye , Professor Holden . Hesitates . Luck to you . Shaking his head , stooped , he hurries out . p. 141 MADELINE After a moment when neither can speak . Good-bye  --  auntie dearest . Thank you  --  for the birthday present  --  the cake  --  everything . Everything  --  all the years . There is something Aunt Isabel would say , but she can only hold tight to Madeline 's hands . At last , with a smile that speaks for love , a little nod , she goes . Emil comes in . JOHNSON You better go with them , Madeline . It 'd make it better for you . MADELINE Oh no , it would n't . I 'll be with you in an instant , Emil . I want to  --  say goodbye to my father . But she waits before that door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks around the room . Sees the bag of corn , takes out a couple of ears and is looking at them as Madeline returns . She remains by the door , shaken with sobs , turns , as if pulled back to the pain she has left . JOHNSON Gee . This is great corn . MADELINE Turning now to him . It is , is n't it , Emil ? JOHNSON None like it . MADELINE And you say  --  your corn is getting better ? p. 142 JOHNSON Oh , yes  --  I raise better corn every year now . MADELINE Low . That 's nice . I 'll be right out , Emil . He puts the corn back , goes out . From the closet Madeline takes her hat and wrap . Putting them on , she sees the tennis racket on the table . She goes to it , takes it up , holds it a moment ; then takes it to the closet , puts it carefully away , closes the door behind it . A moment she stands there in the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . ( END OF PLAY. )
