Before the conference of Anglo-American historians , meeting last week in London , went Premier Stanley Baldwin of Britain to welcome them and to enunciate a Tory view of historical writing that caused a flurry of international comment , mostly favorable . Said Mr. Baldwin : " I am quite sure that if you try to bring up youth on entirely unbiased history he will never read it . I prefer my own method of getting a vivid picture first and correcting it afterwards ; because , generally speaking , you do not want to be fair until you are grown up . ... I think that to try to make young people see every side and sit on the fence would be to train up a generation of mug-wumps who would be singularly ineffective in practical life . . . . " <P> Mr. Baldwin explained that his own reading of history had begun with Froissart , going on to Scott , Macaulay , Froude , Carlyle , Clarendon . He dwelt upon the opportunity for some historian to deal with the American Revolution from the viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint of " Old England " to whom the Revolution was , at the time , not an epoch-making event but simply a regrettable incident . Polite answers from the U. S. historians present greeted these remarks , but minds went back to ponder the proposition that bias is best in history . ... It was a reactionary proposition , quite out of line with the best liberal pedagogy of the day and with the ironic resurrection of " mauve " and " dreadful " decades now so popular in the U. S. But without bias , Mr. Baldwin 's listeners reflected , there might be nothing left of party , or even of national , spirit among men . Even supposing impartial history could be made readable , the stunting effect of philosophical detachment upon young people 's emotional equipment would be fearful to contemplate . They might never have the slightest desire to rush out to war for the motherland . They might reason so broadly about government that fine old political issues would become meaningless and forgotten , and states would perhaps fall into the hands of dreadfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in their books , with no axes to grind , no slogans to shout and no fine frenzies to indulge .
