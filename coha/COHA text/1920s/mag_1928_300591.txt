Blue canvas for a ceiling stretched over Chicago 's Coliseum last week . It was intended to represent the sky ; few of the thousands who visited the first International Aeronautical Exposition under that dyed sky paid attention to it . Airport beacons flicked their beams about the room ; few noticed them . People hurried around the Coliseum and two auxiliary show buildings to see and buy airplanes . <P> And buy they did-300 Command-Aires , + 500 American Eagles , 500 Travel Airs , 200 Swallows . Fairchild and Curtiss made large contracts for plane deliveries . Scarcely was there a plane manufacturer who did not book immediate orders . Kreider-Reisner Challengers were popular , was were Hamilton Metalplanes , Mohawk Pintos , Monarchs , Mono-coupes , Advance Wacos , and Consolidated Husky Juniors . Customers for the most part were young men . Air transport managers-for Transcontinental , National , Boeing , Western Air Express , Pan-American-examined the huge passenger planes - Fords , Fokkers , Loenings , Boeings , Keystones , Ryans , Stinson-Detroiters . <P> The British De Haviland Moth was the only foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large group of European aeronautic authorities who visited the show on their way to the International Aeronautics Conference at Washington , this week , and the 28th flying anniversary at Kitty Hawk , N. C. <P> Wright Aeronautical Corp . picked the show week to make a shrewd commercial gesture . Everybody knows the reputation of Wright Whirlwind and Cyclone motors , as they know the reputation of Pratt &; Whitney Wasp and Hornet motors . But relatively few know the practical advantages of those motors . So Wright Aeronautical told the many unknowing ones in great advertisements that its $25-h. p . Cyclone is built for the great air lines and heavy-duty express planes , its 3OO-h. p . Whirlwind for multi-motored passenger carriers , its 225-h. p . Whirlwind for medium-sized passenger planes , its 150-h. p . Whirlwind for small runabout planes . Topping those advertisements , Wright 's then announced that they would manufacture the loo-h. p . De Haviland Gypsy , a four-cylinder-in-line air-cooled engine ( the other Wrights are radial air-cooled ) for small gadabouts. + Usufructs of this astute advertising : people have bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will buy twice as many as this ; and they may naturally be expected to demand the motors they know most about . <P> <P> + Brilliant example of the air industry 's swift enterprise . Young R. B. Snowden Jr . of Memphis , Tenn. , reorganized Command-Aire , Inc. , only last October to make biplanes at Little Rock , Ark. , to sell at $3,250 . Sales directed at business and college men have made Command-Aire a leader in the industry . *At $2,400 without motor . TIME , Dec. 3 , erroneously printed the price as $24,000. +The Gypsy is the third British motor to be made in this country The others : Cirrus , similar to the Gypsy ; the Bristol Jupiter air-cooled radial .
