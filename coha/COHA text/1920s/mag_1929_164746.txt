Along the battlefront of the Tariff War last week ran the clatter of musketry as Senate soldiers tussled for the first time over actual rates . There was so much scampering back and forth between the lines that at times it was hard to tell on which side a Senator was really fighting . <P> The Democratic-Insurgent Republican coalition first held a special caucus-of-war at the headquarters of Field Marshal Simmons . They decided to reverse their strategy of last Spring limiting tariff fighting only to the Farm Lowlands . They consented to give the regular Republicans battle all along the tariff line , with a view to beating down with their rifle butts all industrial rates that dared pop their heads above the present trench level . <P> Under Brevet-Brigadier La Follette , the Coalition troops marched forth to open their attack at Chemical Corner , behind which they thought lurked the Dye Trust . ' Their first day 's assault was successful . Five Republican generals ( Couzens , Jones of Washington , Glenn , Robinson of Indiana , Thomas of Idaho ) , were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1913 ( Underwood Tariff ) line in the gallic acid segment and were hustled out of their trenches ( 45 to 33 ) in the tannic acid sector . <P> Flushed with victory , the coalition troopers pushed on toward Calcium Carbide-ville , only to suffer a bad reverse on the barbed wire entanglements of the Power Trust . ( Power companies supply electricity to manufacture calcium in plants widely scattered over the U. S. ) Thirteen Democrats with power or carbide plants in their States broke ranks in the face of the enemy , refused to charge . The assault to halve the ifz ' - per- lb. rate was repulsed by the regular Republicans ( 42 to 37 ) . <P> Coalition ranks reformed , pressed on to Casein Creek . ( Casein is a skimmed milk by-product of large industrial value . ) Battle lines crumbled weakly as the attackers swept through to double the rate ( 2 to 5 per lb . ) . Farmers cheered lustily and manufacturers of waterproof paints , glue , coated paper , groaned with despair . <P> Up the other side of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar salient temporarily lest it be treacherously mined , but forcing ergot and crude chicle on the free list . Democratic Senator Steck of Iowa , weary from running from side to side in fighting , insisted that the tariff campaign promises of both parties must be thoroughly fulfilled . <P> A brief hold-up occurred over hexamethylenetetramine ( derivative of formaldehyde and ammonia used in medicine and vulcanized rubber ) when Generalissimo Smoot could not pronounce it . Ink rates fell suddenly with a great black splash over the regulars . Epsom salts collapsed feebly under the jabbing attack of the Coalition .
