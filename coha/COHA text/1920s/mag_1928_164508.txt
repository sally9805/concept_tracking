Penn was on the inside lane , Yale on the outside , and Columbia in the middle . On the course at the Schuylkill at Philadelphia , with its staggered start and its finish laid at an angle past a bend , the outside lane was much the hardest . But the course did not bother the Yale crew . It was in front when the three boats settled down after the racing start and it stayed in front , fighting off Columbia 's sprints , to win by three quarters of a length . Penn was three lengths behind Columbia . <P> At Cambridge the heavy Harvard crew pushed over a rough mile and three quarters of the Charles River to nose out M. I. T. by a quarter of a length . And on other rivers other crews were practicing , watched by critics who every season go from college to college , watching workouts from launches or from the boathouse platform . Other commentators , believing that things in rowing , more than in any other sport , are decided by training methods , considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed last week was Edward O. Leader ( Yale ) , gruff and domineering , who has built his crew out of meagre material . A week before the race at Philadelphia he found a stroke , Woodruff Rankin Tappen . He believes that Yale will row in the Olympics . <P> No other coach has turned out as consistently fine crews as Leader . He lost two races last year : one to Harvard , when a Yale man " caught a crab , " and one to Princeton , through overconfidence . The Yale crew did not raise its beat until it was inside the flags marking the last quarter mile and even at that it finished within a few feet of the winner . If it had not been for these two slips Leader would have a record of six years without a defeat . He is efficient because he is absorbed in training a crew to row , without considering the minor problems of morale , college politics or his personal popularity . He is liked by the great tribe of Yale alumni , most of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympics he is probably right .
