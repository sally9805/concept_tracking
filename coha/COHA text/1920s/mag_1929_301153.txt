Loud was the outcry of U. S. newspaper publishers when Canadian papermakers , prodded by provincial government officials , announced they would have to charge $5 more than $55.20 per ton ( the present price ) for newsprint ( TIME , Dec. 9 et seq . ) . The American Newspaper Publishers Association made the threatening gesture of inviting Federal investigation . They also made the conciliatory gesture of inviting a committee of the Newsprint Institute of Canada to meet with them in Manhattan and talk things over . Last week the pulpsters replied : Their minds were made up , they would not go to Manhattan to discuss the matter further , the price would be raised to $60 per ton with a $5 reduction for the first six months on three-year contracts . <P> A six-month truce was forced upon them by the biggest company among them , U. S.-owned International Paper Co . Not a member of the institute , free to act independently , International offered newsprint at $55.20 per ton until July 1 , promising 30 days ' notice of any price change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
