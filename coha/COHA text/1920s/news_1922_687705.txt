The money paid to Mr. Connor was for his services in buying control of the Wheeling &; Lake Erie , which was the connecting link in the entry of.Mr . Gould 's Wabash Railway into Pittsburgh . Mr. Connor , who sold his Stock Exchange seat in 1910 , after having held it sinci. 1871 , ' was known as one of the Most spectacular operators on the exchange for many years . Jay Gould , and later George J. Gould , as well as the late G. P. Merosini , were partners in his firm . Many of Connor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His office adjoined that of Mr. Sage in the structure on the prLsent site of the Empire building , at Broadway and Rector Street , and it ' was in Connors office that Mr. Sage took refuge after the attempt of Norcross to blow him up with a bomb . Payment Is Revealed . Direct testi/ley as to payment of the $102,000 by Mr. Connor to Mr. Gould was brought out after Mr. Gould had been cross-examined , and books of the Mercantile Trust Company , which financed the Wabash-Pittsburgh Terminal through the Pittsburgh and Toledo syndicate , showed that un April 4 , 1901 , Mr. Connor 's account with the trust company had a credit of $479,5S4 ; that on the same day there was a debit entry of $102,000 , and that on the same day this amount had been credited on the books to Mr. Gould . Louis Marshall , attorney for the receivers , led up to this fact when , in cross-examining Mr. Gould , he asked about a telegram to the late General Louis Fitzgerald , Chairman of the Mercantile Trust Company board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $1,000,000 payment to Mr. Cone nor . This Mr. Gould had said on Tuesday was necessary because control of the Wheeling &; Lake Erie could be obtained through Mr. Connor at less expense than in any other manner . ' I he testimony showed that the syndicate paid Mr. Connor $15 for common stock and $35 for second preferred stock of that road , besides giving his $1,000,000 for his services . Mr. Gould testified yesterday that he had nothing to do with the telegram but that he was the only member of the syndicate then in the city , and that he thought he had given the necessary approval required In the telegram to authorize President Deming of the Mercantile Trust Company to pay the balance due Connor &; Co. in behalf of Mr. Connor . " I had no other business connections with Mr. Connor at this- time , neither did 1 receive anything from or pay anything to him , " - said Mr. Gould . When asked at what time his business relations with Mr. Connor- had ceased , Mr. Gould said he thought he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . In reply to a question from Justice Finch , the witness said the Pittsburgh &; Toledo syndicate had a certain lump sum , to pay out for the purchase of control of the Wheeling &; Lake Erie , and " did n't care how it was divided up . " Reference to Carnegie .. On redirect examination , a copy of a letter from the late Joseph Ramsay Jr. , who brought about the syndicate , to Mr. Gould , dated Jan. 1 , 1901 , was shown to Mr. Gould by his attorney . It referred to the organization of corporations in the vicinity of Pittsburgh to put through the plan of the syndicate . Mr. Marshall objected to the offering . of the copy , and asked Mr. Gould If he could remember the contents of the original after 21 years .. He said he believed the copy offered was genuine because of its reference to Andrew Carnegie . Mr. Ramsey wrote about the desirability et acquiring the Wheeling &; Lake Erie , saying that while the syndicate could build a , line of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the Wheeling- Lake El le , yet that road was a good property lfecause of its heavy coal freight and in that respect would be valuable to the Wabash . He said further it wou:d be dan- gerous to have the Wheeling &; Lake Erie out of the project because that road would- be forced to build a competing line into Pittsburgh or " sell out to those who would build and were anxious to control the situation . " He estimated that it . would cost $6,000,000 to construct the connection with the Wheeling &; Lake Erie from Pittsburgh , and that the acquisition of the latter would cost $7.000,000 . He thought the gross earnings would be more than $6 , - 000,01 ) 0 the first year , and that there would be at least $600,000 left for dividends . Mr. Ramsey wrote that he thought Mr. Carnegie would buy all the bonds or ' back the project in some other way , and if he would n't , probably some other Pittsburgh manufacturer would . Mr. Gould testified that of the $6,000 , - 000 received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wabash-Pittsburgh Terminal bonds the syndicate devoted $3 , - 2.39,606 to pay off the balance of the Mercantile Trust Company loan for the actual purchase of Wheeling &; Lake Erie control , and the remainder was used to pay otf the second loan for the construction of the terminal road . He said that at a meeting of the syndicate managers it was decided unanimously to make this disposition . On recross-examination Mr. Gould testified that the managers voted first to pay off all the debts of the syndicate and to . turn over the balance of the funds to the Wabash-Pittsburgh Terminal . When Washington E. Connor was called to the stand in behalf of the defendants he . was asked about the payment of $102.000 to Mr. Gould . He replica that in his first talk with Mr. Gould over buying control of ill ' ? Wheeling &; Lak .. Erie for the syndicate he demanded from Mr. Gould an interest of $1,000,000 in the syndicate . II ! said Mr. Gould came to him later and told hint an interest of $2,000,000 had been allotted to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland , Canton and Southern syndicate , a private venture composed of fifteen friends of ex-Governor Tferrick . Part of this syndicate property consisted of a block of Wheeling &; Lake Erie stock , which the Gould syndicate wanted . Mr. Connor testified that when Mr. Gould . came to him with his generous offer of an additional $1,000.000 interest in the Pittsburgh &; Toledo syndicate and explained to him that subscriptions to that syndicate promised 15 per cent . profit and 6 per cent . interest on the money devoted to , , the syndicate , representing a prospective profit of $300.000 : Mr. Connor then gave Mr. Gould $102.000 of his ( Mr. Connor'sl share of the profits in the Cleveland ; Canton &; Southern . and figured that he was getting three to one at that . When asked if he had paid Mr. Gould the money out of his own funds , Mr. Conner said he did . and that his own firm was in several syndicates at the time . that the stock market was feverish , and he did n't want to disturb the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercantile Trust Company for the money . Mr. Connor said the exchange between him and Mr. Gould of the syndicate interests was entirely voluntary . Mr. Connor said his generosity to Mr. Gould was due largely to gratitude because he could distribute the extra money he would get to good advantage among persons whose good-will he wanted at that time . - Justice Finch , commenting on Mr. Connor 's testimony , suggested that he already had a $1.000.000 interest in the Gould syndicate and that since he would get only about $150.000 from the additional $1,000.000 he really did n't gain much . Mr. Marshall , in cross-examining Mr. Connor . asked if it was the custom to have verbal agreements in such syndic , . te operations , and Mr. Connor replied : " In all my dealings with Jay Gould any time I participated In any of his ventures there would always ' be a verbal agreement . " Mr. Connor insisted that the payment of $102.006 to Mr. Gould had nothing to do with the payment of the $1.000,000 authorized to him by Mr. Gould for services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a " cover " for tho t transaction . The last witness was John H. McClement. banker and railroad expert . who said he was sent to Pittsburgh by the Mercantile Trust Company in October . 1003 , to look over the WabashPittsburgh Terminal property , investigate - the disbursements and ? account for the $17,119.458 spent . The purpose of his trip was to prepare plans for liquidation of the syndicate because the trust company wanted to know just how the money was spent . whether the . payments were proper , and how much more would be required . McClement reported that the cost of the Wheeling &; Lake Erie stock was $5.469.782. and there was an interest charge of $502,415 . The total sum . sent to Pittsburgh to be spent there for the actual purpose of the terminal railway construction was $11.050,000 . Mr. McC'ement said he accounted for all this except $160.000 , which the late Mr. Ramsay said he would account for personally to the syndicate managers . There was a cash balance of $15,823 in the syndicate treasury .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
