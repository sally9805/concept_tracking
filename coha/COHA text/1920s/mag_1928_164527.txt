THE LIVING BUDDHA-Paul Morand-Henry Holt ( $2.50 ) . Spengler and Keyserling have turned toward the Orient for destruction and salvation of the Occident . Far less seriously , Paul Morand , scintillating French diplomat-novelist , shows the East has much to offer the West , and the West something to the East , but that incompatibility of mind and heart will prevent any contact close enough for destruction or salvation . <P> The Story . Jli is heir apparent to the kingdom of Karastra . Thirsting for Occidental wisdom , he escapes Asia , arrives impoverished in London , where he shrinks from bustle , rain , cupidity . He sells some jewels , and moves to Claridge's. * Naked heiresses disgust him , aristocratic drawing rooms open to actors and prizefighters amaze . At Cambridge he devours the knowledge which a cultured French friend sorts out for him . When his French friend dies , Jli mourns him deeply , but ruminates upon the curious Western distaste for death . The East , having learned the desirability of death , celebrates its advent with garish ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices his circumstantial similarity to Buddha , believes himself the new Buddha , visions " saving " the West . He shaves his head , exchanges " garments by Poole " for a beggar 's garb , and tosses his riches away . London , but for a few dishevelled lady-mystics , is unimpressed . So Jli takes himself to Paris and there , under a willow tree in the Bois de Boulogne , invites the peace of Nirvana . <P> Paris Bohemians , needing diversion , become his disciples . So also Rosemary Kent , daughter of a steel magnate , Great Dragon of the Indiana K. K. K. As brother and sister they live in Marly woods , barefoot , till Rosemary catches cold , and returns to patent-leather slippers in America . <P> But she leaves behind her a most unphilosophical Buddha , as is seen when Jli forsakes his willow tree and , in hot pursuit , takes passage to the U. S. Lunch with Rosemary at Sherry 's ends in catastrophe when the people at the next table object to " the colored man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient watchmaker mumbles his philosophy of resignation and indifference . Comforted by the old Chinaman , disgusted with the Occident , Jli returns to the pomp and ceremony of coronation in Karastra . <P> Technically , " the living Buddha " means the priest ( or rather , the candidate for Nirvana ) who is by way of being pope in Tibet of present day Buddhism . A new Buddha is , however , predicted for each cycle , and it is such , evidently , that Jli for a time thought himself . His exotic career at Cambridge is delightfully Zuleika Dobsonesque , and artificial as his rustic life in the Bois . <P> The Author . France , patron of the arts , frequently offers her young authors the travel and leisure of the diplomatic service ( Paul Claudel , Jean Giraudoux ) . Author Morand has been attached to the embassies of London , Rome , Madrid , and finally Bangkok . To and from this last post he traveled by way of America , Japan , India , collecting data for his latest book . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was educated at Oxford , studied law and political science in Paris , is a prolific writer , notably of post-War character sketches . Sleek of face and hair , he looks still younger than he is . <P>
