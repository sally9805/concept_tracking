Stupidity Goes Marching Forth In the Name of Morality <P> Justice John Ford of the Supreme Court of New York , like Polonius , had a daughter . One day , so the story goes , he caught her reading D. H. Lawrence 's Women in Love . It is a very long novel , an erudite and obscure novel , and some critics say - among them H. L. Mencken - a very dull novel . But unquestionably it has some erotic passages which are intelligible to the sophisticated intelligentsia , Whether they were understood by his daughter or not Justice Ford did not say ; whether her mind was corrupted by them he did not try to ascertain . But Justice Ford , being a lawyer and used to the obscure and euphemistic language of legal pleading , understood them and was out raged . Because his daughter might have been shocked by some highly literary but indecent expression , Justice Ford set about outlawing the whole body of literature from the Greek classics to George Moore for everybody , at least in New York State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein the mobilized blue forces of New York are attempting to jam through the legislature the most drastic piece of censorship in American history . <P> Their legal weapon is the so-called Cotillo-Jesse bill . <P> This bill provides that any book containing a " lewd , obscene , or filthy word or expression " is liable to get into trouble . The intent of the book is not considered ; if from the purest and most moral motives it used an obscene word it comes under the law . The book is not to be judged as a whole but shall be condemned for a single passage out of its context . In one fell stroke this clause would outlaw the Bible , Shakespeare , the Greek and Roman classics , Swift , Chaucer , the whole of Restoration comedy , Milton , Fielding , Voltaire , Flaubert , Goethe , Balzac , the writings of the early Christian fathers , Martin Luther , the Encyclopedia Britannica and the dictionary . <P> Moreover , another provision of the law forbids the introduction of expert testimony by the defense . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society for the Suppression of Vice , who are backing the bill , can not hope for conviction if expert intelligence is brought to bear on a suspect author . They must rely on ignorance and prejudice . <P> It is a significant fact that not a single author , nor a single publisher , whether of books or magazines , has appeared in favor of the bill . <P> Surely here is censorship gone mad .
