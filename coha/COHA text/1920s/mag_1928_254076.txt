Proud , swashbuckling Brigadier General Jos Alvarez-since 1924 Chief of Staff to President Plutarco Elias Calles-is suspected of being a monstrous smuggler , a multifaced Judas , a thoroughgoing rapscallion . <P> Not until last week , however , would even potent Mexicans have dared to cry " Rapscallion ! " at steelyeyed , quick-triggered General Jos . Then , suddenly , President Plutarco Elias Calles , bull-necked and bushy-browed , took pen into heavy fist and dashed an angry signature onto a proclamation : " To my greatest surprise , and assuredly that of the entire country , it has been discovered that one of the highest officials of the Administration and a prominent member of the army , General Jos Alvarez , the Chief of my Headquarters Staff , who had enjoyed my friendship and confidence , has proved traitor to the most elementary principles of honor and morality by not only directing and manipulating a large amount of contraband merchandise but also by using my name in telegraphic orders to protect such merchandise and to assure himself of immunity . <P> " My constant endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my Administration . I believe that I have complied with that purpose by having suppressed with an iron hand such crimes as that now in question immediately upon discovering them . I will continue that line of conduct until I leave office . <P> " Consequently , as soon as I obtained conclusive proofs of the crime in question , I ordered the immediate dismissal of Alvarez and consigned him to the competent authorities . " <P> Soon Rapscallion Alvarez was specifically charged with furthering the smugglery of $250,000 worth of silk into Mexico . In rebuttal he declared under oath to a high police official : " I deny any knowledge of this affair . I have been made the dupe of others . " <P> Presently detectives swooped , arrested the Signorina Maria Conesa , Spanish danseuse , toast of Mexican boulevardeurs , able duper of many a dupe .
