txt Former Ambassador MORGENTHAU goes today on a mission which is comparable in importance with that of an official diplomat . He sails for Greece to take the active Chairmanship of the commission under the League of Nations for the settlement of refugees from Anatolia in Western Thrace and Macedonia . There are 600,000 of these exiles who , having fled from Anatolia , where their ancestors lived for generations , are now given shelter by the Greek Government and the Greek people . More than a million acres of land ( vacant lands and crown lands ) have been deeded by the Greek Government to this use . The Greeks have undertaken to attempt to raise among themselves ** The British have made a temporary loan of f1,000,000 . And it is hoped to sell long-term bonds in the total amount of ? 6,000,000 for the constructive work of setting up these refugees in agriculture ' and elementary industries . This great public enterprise is to be carried forward under the direction of a committee of four members , named by the League - of Nations , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in no way obligated to help forward this beneficent enterprise . Mr. MORGENTHAU goes in a private capacity . But he will have back of him the good-will of a great body of citizens who feel that we should co-operate in every possible practical way to help a people who have , with all their mistakes , behaved most hospitably and generously toward others in distress . While the Red Cross and the Near East Relief and some other organizations have given a helpful hand since the great Smyrna disaster , the Greeks themselves have given far more than all outside agencies ? as two to one ? in providing for these exiles , some of whom have no more claim upon the hospitality of Greece than upon that of the rest of Europe or of America . It is a work of rehabilitation which ought to succeed , not only for the sake of those who will be directly aided but also because of the wholesome general influence which such a successful effort would have . What is needed is not another Deucalion and Pyrrha incident in Greece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with seed , plows and harrows and other agricultural implements . The very valley in which ALEXANDER the Great was born needs to be conquered by agricultural industry . If this is accomplished the flight of the refugees to Greece may turn out to be a blessing for that disturbed , historic land .
