Tenderloin . Sputtering , squealing , the first night audience squeaked in their seats . They were looking , listening , to Warner 's new talking cinema . <P> They saw Dolores Costello as the pure dancing girl asleep at midnight . Entered the villain demanding the stolen money . With hand to throat , she vows innocence . <P> The audience then heard this gamey dialogue : <P> " All right-you 're not bad to look at , and my night shall not be wasted . " <P> " Not that-not that-surely you have a sister . " <P> Director Curtiz had opened this picture with such simple symbolism as a skinny cat sniffing garbage pails , following with a tale whose luridity dated back to the Black Crook , famed thriller . This one paraded the emotions of Rose Shannon , night club dancer who loved a handsome bank robber ( Conrad Nagel ) . Eventually , wildly , wrongly , she is suspected of stealing , is arrested , scared under the third degree , where the spoken dialogue is first heard . To end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , classic embrace . <P> Of the voices , Cinema Critic Harriette Underhill wrote : " The fact that all screen talking devices give the characters a certain lisp , slightly detracts from the serious effect . So , when the beautiful heroine clasps her hands , rolls her eyes and cries , ' Why do you perthitht in perthecuting me ? I am innothent ! ' it sounds funnier than if she were speaking her lines in ' perthon . ' " <P> The Secret Hour . There is no denying the cinemart of Pola Negri , but it is a shame to see her put into cotton stockings and handing out coffee in a San Francisco lunch room . Nonetheless , JLuigi ( Jean Hersholt ) , potent orange grower , is attracted by Waitress Pola . He writes her a letter inviting her to his farm , enclosing a photograph of his handsome house man , Jack . Then he gets full of giggle water and drives his car into a creek while going to meet Waitress Pola at the railroad station . Of course , Waitress Pola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all rather diverting . Sidney Howard wrote it , using his successful play , They Knew What They Wanted , as a basis . <P> The Heart of a Follies Girl should not be touched with a forty-foot pole . The plot is like a last year 's fresh egg . The captions are like nice round soup dishes full of soup . The girl ( Billie Dove ) is like a seven-course dinner in which each course is a can of condensed milk . <P> The Night Flyer . Speedy , thrilling is this picture of how the mail train raced to Medicine Bend . Director James Cruze routed from the round house the engines of pioneer railroad days as a setting for a story as primitive as that of Casey Jones . <P> Jim ( William Boyd ) was a fireman , Bat <P> ( Philo McCullough ) an engineer . Both loved snub-nosed Kate ( Jobyna Ralston ) daughter of the lunch room lady . Jim warns Bat to go slowly round the curve . Bat speeds up , skids , smashes into the ditch . Unhurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail bags , rushes to Medicine Bend on time , winning the contract and Kate . <P>
