X'hat will not be for long , Mr. Cole surmises . But that is a detail . What is essential is that on assuming ownership the public makes itself responsible for keeping the capital of the industry intact and for new investments . It may be assumed that capital for replacements and extensions will as a rule be derived , as now , from the surplus earnings of the industry . Actual operations will be conducted by managers , appointed by committees representing equally the managing staff and the rank and file . How the managing staff would be recruited , how promotions would be made , present nice problems of administration which Mr. Cole does not undertake to solve definitively , although he offers luminous suggestions on the point , which - unfortunately I have not space to discuss . Unlike the Plumb plan the Cole plan makes no provision for the representation of the general public or of the consumers in the committees in control of industrial operations . The consumers , organized in cooperative societies , could exert needed pressure upon the industry through Parliament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be practicable for the public to buy out industries at random and turn them over to the personnel for management . A prerequisite to this scheme of reconstruction is a thoroughgoing organization of labor , which includes not only the manual workers , skilled and unskilled , but also the technical and office staff . The mining industry , however , has attained to a condition of organization which would justify nationalization . The transport industries may be placed in the same class . But not so the great engineering industry which is all shot through with labor organizations on the old trade lines , and in which the conflict between skilled and semi-skilled labor is naturally acute . Neither is the work done in this industry easily standardized or reduced to centralized management . For this industry Mr. Cole recommends a policy of " encroaching " labor control while private ownership still survives . Let the shop stewards movement be carried forward to its logical conclusion ; let labor wrest from the employer , the whole of discipline on the job , the right to hire and fire . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " whereby the employers would agree to a lump sum compensation for a particular job , while the distribution of the sum among the several grades of workmen was de termined by the workers themselves . A still different condition is presented by the cotton industry , where the pro cess of manufacture has been reduced to mere routine and business functions are chiefly concentrated at the commercial ends of the industry , the import of raw cotton and the export of cloth . Something like the war control of cotton importation would be essential to reorganization . Besides , the labor organivitions in the industry require new func tions , to awaken them out of the lethargy produced by generations of Niggling over the piece rate . Mr. Cole suggests that they concentrate on " welfare " functions . In the building industry perhaps the shift to the new basis might be accomplished almost immediately , since fixed capital amounts to little or nothing and cities requiring building done could furnish credit directly to a building , guild as they often do now to the private contractor . Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cole 's general scheme would not apply without modification . Mr. Cole does not pretend to exhaustive discussion , but covers only so many instances as may be necessary to exhibit the flexibility of his reconstruction plan . He does not even look forward to a completely exclusive guild scheme as a desirable ultimate state . He would leave it open to the largest possible number of persons Ito workon their own account , either as petty traders or as operators of small shops worked chiefly by their own labor . It is only to the large scale enterprise that Mr. Cole 's scheme of organization applies . Whether events are actually tending toward the rah ' zation of an industrial order as definitely based upon M. ganized labor as the present system is based upon organizetl capital is a question that can be answered conclusively ordY after an examination of the pertinent facts of industrisl psychology much more exhaustive than Cole presents in M'Y of his writings , or than could be presented forthwith by all of his critics . Whether an industrial system based on of ganized labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that neither Cole nor his critics would wisely undertake to answer categorically . It 10i i ' be admitted that it is harder to think of great masses of labor , held together by bonds of personal organization , functioning so smoothly to the end of public service as great masses of capital , held together through corpora " , organization and financial control have worked to the et ? of private enrichment . On the other hand , one can hardlY , conceive that a system based on labor organization could be so generally permeated by graft and cut-throat methods as even the most smoothly working capitalistic system . Mr ' Cole 's system may not inspire confident belief in those whose approach to economic study has been through the classical formulae . But no one can afford to dismiss it as a tissue of fallacies , an impossible Utopia . It become impossible only if capitalism can be redeemed of its present tendency to destroy the creative impulses of labor which ' alone can give permanence to any industrial system . ALVIN JOHNSON The Group Mind The Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply them to the Interpretation of National Life and Character , by William McDougall , F. R. S. New York : G. P. Pia ' nam 's Sons . INCE collective psychology is one of the most ilninr ture of the sciences , the greatest need of those who a " plore it is that they should , as Mr. Morris Cohen has said ' learn to disinfect themselves and their instruments . They start with a strong sense that . there is something or other I. ? explore which will ultimately matter a good deal . For hu " man beings are grouped , and a vast amount of mental ac : tivity is affected by that grouping . But about the natal ' of that activity all of us are plainly confused . Crowd ! ' morale , tradition , nationality , patriotism , college spirit ' class spirit , " class consciousness , " loyalty , roo per cent Americanism , are words all of them that indicate the exTt-ence of a field of knowledge almost virgin to scientific lo " vestigation . When they are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concise meaning , and the c that they are used is in itself a fact and a clue . t , But . the growing desire to penetrate these mom o rentous scurities is everywhere baffled by a chaos of definitionsEach psychologist , and certainly every school , seems to Cucu tivate a private lingo which makes it virtually impossible , 0 knowhen when en are two talking are about talking erent about onesthe same . James'sthing and when cr cial selves , " Trotter 's herd instinct , Freud 's censor , Tar " e , 5 imitation , McDougall 's sympathetic induction , Gidchag , consciousness of kind , Sidis 's suggestibility are all pre ? n is ably aimed at about the same target , but where these tan // coincide and where they diverge it is not easy to discover by reading the books . Sometimes it almost seems as if the psychologists do not read each other 's books . Professor McDougall , for example , does not seem to regard as deserving of notice such extremely important contemporaries as Trotter , Wallas , Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he has the space and energy to answer a patrioteer who attacked him because psychology might endanger loyalty to the British Empire . This disorderly individualism is merely the superficial aspect of , a disorder in ideas . What is group psychology ? Is there a Group Mind that leads a jolly or a sombre existence as an oversoul somewhere between , above , or around the minds of those who compose the group ? Or is the Group Mind another name for the minds of the group ? Or is it neither , but rather both ? These are important questions , because your answer to them will determine what you will study when you set up as a social psychologist . Mr. McDougall 's answer is worth watching closely . He rejects the Oversoul , that is to say , he specifically denies that there is a " collective consciousness " apart from individual human consciousness . For this rejection he gives two reasons : first , that there is no evidence for the idea , and second that it is a German idea . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group . For " the social aggregate has a collective mental life , which is not merely the sum of the mental lives of its units " and " it may be contended that a society not only enjoys a collective mental life but also has a collective mental or , as some prefer to say , a collective soul . " Now this sounds at first glance as if the Oversoul , forced to abdicate as German and untrue had been restored to the throne . It not only sounds that way , but it is that way . For the sad truth is that Mr. McDougall 's four hundred pages are almost entirely based on the premise of an over-soul which he tried so hard to reject . How did that happen ? How did the hypostasized Group Mind come back to govern and , as I believe , to thwart the investigation ? It came back no doubt primarily because Mr. McDougall believes in it in spite of everything . This assertion can be ventured because the pages of this book are strewn with evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplate his own group life without feeling worshipful . To worship he must deify . To deify it he must regard the group as somehow over and above the scraggly human individuals who compose it . Now Mr. McDougall feels a peculiar awe for all the groups he happens to belong to . Oxford and Cambridge , the army , England , Scotland , the Empire are repeatedly advanced as samples of group life at its best . Next in order of approval , but considerably below , come the Allies , ? France above all , Japan , and the United States ( after it entered the war ) . Down low come trade unions , Ireland , and Europe east of the Rhine . The rule which prevents a physician from operating upon a member of his own family because his emotion would interfere with his judgment is one that no scientist can afford to ignore . Mr. McDougall has ignored it . That is to say he has not searched his heart to free himself from his own group affiliations sufficiently to approach his subject with a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is weedy with those very moral preferences and prejudices of group life , which it was his task to explain . He has not accomplished that first stage in social investigation , which is to become acutely aware of your own social inheriance , and by awareness to discount it He has attempted the impossible task of examining what he calls the Group Mind while he remains more than half embedded in- his own Group Mind . He has not disinfected himself or hIS instruments . There is consequently a conflict in his thought between the emancipated part of him , which is the scientist , and the unemancipated . part , which is mere membership in his groups . The scientist in him rejects the Oversoul as suPet ? stition ; the member clings to it as an object of worship , the victory is given to this more ancient and primitive Part of him . The Group Mind is accepted as an entity above the aggregate individual minds . But it is masked . F ? 1 science has its claims . The conflict is resolved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case by draw ' . ing a distinction between group mind and group conscioo ness . Mr. McDougall defines mind " as an organized system 0f interacting mental or psychical forces . " As I understaed , this , you can speak of a collective mind when a number ? I individuals are reacting upon each other in something 10 , e than a casual relation . You call it a " collective mind , " a ' though you must try at the same time to remember that anything you may know about it is known only through individual minds . This seems to me the confusion of the logical with the psychological . It is like saying that the rules of chess and the moves being made under those rules are the collective nlifiu of two men playing chess . You can call it that if you like " But what you have done is to use a word that connotes 3 psychic process to denote a logical system . And if you it sist upon regarding the logical system as the subject of Your study you may possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not learn anything about the psychology of the chess players . Mr. McDougall 's group mind is not a psychological fact at all , and that is why his investigations of it produce s ? little fresh insight into the psychology of groups . For nilec having admitted the group mind as a unity somehow distifict from the individuals , he is forced to continue treating it as .. a unity . He can therefore describe it only from the outside ' He can not take it apart and show how it is put together ? r how it works . He has to regard the group mind as an issr ? analyzed lump , and then to generalize about how that lumP . behaves . His sketch of " principles " thus turns out to be a series of semi-moral judgments , interspersed with exh ? ti tation . People are fickle in casual groups , sturdy and ral in highly organized groups , and so on through all the nau of trite and dubious generalizations , to pages and pages , ) e t undocumented , unverified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about inferiority and superiority , ah ? 1 ? 4 races , subraces , deductive Frenchmen , empirical Englis ? t men , anarchic Hindus , lazy Orientals and the rest of the g debris which it is the task of psychology to explain , not to repeat . Whatever the value of this talk as pamphleteering 1 ? r , the views which Mr. McDougall finds himself attached to , these bastard ideas derived from anthropology , binit history jumbled in one immense confusion , have no val as a contribution to psychology . They take for grail " those very premises which scientists have yet to establish . But at one point , early in the book , Mr. McDougalseems dimly to remember that he is a psychologist , for speaking of crowds he stops to consider what is the methby which emotion communicates itself . That surely is e , entrance to his subject , for when we have learned the rflb chanism by which grouped individuals interact upon eac other we shall really begin to know something . The 11 ? W when and what of hum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one individual to others , from one group to other groups , the process by which ideas and feelings are conducted , what determines susceptibility and obtuseness , these are among the crucial questions for any scientific understanding of group life . Social psychology is that branch of psychology which originates at the points of contacts between individuals , and one can safely assert that no collective psychology will go far or go deep which starts from the group as a whole rather than from the disposition of individuals to form groups . Mr. McDougall stops for a moment to advert to the principle of " simple direct induction " ( described briefly in his Introduction to Social Psychology ) , which he regards as the social bond of a crowd . He practically never returns to the subject , almost never again examines the organization of groups from the inside . I say almost never again , because there are sporadic hints , but of comprehensive discussion of this central theme there is none in the book . For Mr. McDougall was too much diverted by his Group Mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIPPMANN . Smoke and Steel Smoke and Steel , by Carl Sandburg . New York : Harcourt , Brace and Howe . T HIS new collection establishes what Chicago Poems only promised and Cornhuskers plainly intimated . It proves that these states can now claim two living major poets : Sandburg and Frost . Both poets are racially indigenous , both have that blend of toughness and tenderness that tastes of the soil , both are in love with a world of frank and homely realities . But each wears his realism with a difference . Frost kneels at well-curbs and discovers universes ; one farm , one rocky acre is too large for him to exhaust . Sandburg marches and countermarches over two hemispheres ; one world is not large enough for his restless feet . Frost is true to things ; the fact is always brimming over for him ; he never hopes to drain it all . Sandburg also feeds on the fact ; it nourishes , but it does not satisfy him . Frost plays with its twinkling or sardonic suggestions . For Sandburg , hot after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations ; he probes eagerly for the question behind , the answer beyond . The past , " a wind , gone down , " is a dead thing ? " a bucket of ashes . " But To-day , for all its tangibility , is no more solid or substantial to this peculiar realist ; the present is a drifting mist through which he peers at an ocean of tomorrows . It is a revealing title Sandburg has chosen for himself . Steel hardens him , but it is the smoke of steel that prompts and carries his dreams . The very first poem in the new volume uncovers the heart of the contradiction . In this extended title poem it is at once evident that Sandburg is a reporter turned mystic . He uses the actual scene as a point of vivid and abrupt departure ; for him realism acts chiefly as a spring-board . From it he leaps directly into a romantic , lyrical mysticism . Fragments , torn from their setting , would do a double injustice to the unity of Smoke and Steel . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous lengthy works were scarcely long poems at all , but a succession of brief figures ; lyrical snatches ? Prairie is a splendid example ? loosely connected , almost disintegrated . Here mood , accent and image are held at a glowing pitch , fused in a new intensity . This tightening power and sharpness of effect extend through the major portion of the volume , making it the most valuable as it is the most varied of Sandburg 's three offerings . It is a new solidity that hits with a restrained power in the fourteen lines of PennsYl vania , that backs the grim banter of Losers and emphasizes the less than half expressed pathos in A. E. F. There will be a rusty gun on the wall , sweetheart , The rifle grooves curling with flakes of rust . A spider will make a silver string nest in the darkest , warmest corner of it .

Forefingers and thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spoken among half-forgotten , wished.4to-be " forgotten things . They will tell the spider : Go on , you 're doing good work . In the face of those who see only a coarse brutality and distorted veritism in Sandburg , it can not be said too often that he is brutal only when dealing with brutal things , that behind the passionate force of his projectile phrases there burns the greater passion of his pity , that the strength of his hatred is exceeded by the challenge of his love . n is difficult to believe that the harsh and hard-hitting Person who seems to be writing with fists doubled , the Post of that magnificent protest , The Liars ( significantly dated March , 1919 ) , is the same wistful visionary who can make such delicate designs as the Four Preludes on Plaything ' of the Wind or Three Spring Notations on Bipeds , and who can sing so gently of sand-scribblings , women washing their hair , purple martins , a half moon in a high wind ' He is sensitive to every pitch and nuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old cry rises out of the new jargon ?
