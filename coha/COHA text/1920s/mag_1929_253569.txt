The first New York Stock Exchange seat to be sold since the adoption of the 25% membership increase brought , last week , $625,000 , the same figure as for the last seat sold prior to the increase . But last week 's purchase included the seat with its extra one-fourth right ; in other words , five-fourths of a seat was purchased . Thus a precedent was established for valuing each quarter-seat at $125,000 and a seat at $500,000 . The seat was bought by Ferdinand A. Straus from Robert L. Leeds , Mr. Leeds purchased his seat early in January , paid for it $600,000 . <P> Inasmuch as the Straus purchase was for five-fourths of a seat , there still remained the question of what quarter-seats , sold separately , would bring . The bear market caused by the Federal Reserve 's attack on speculative loans ( see p. 47 ) may well lower seat prices since speculation by the general public is always on a bull market . A bear market generally means less trading for seat-holder , fewer commissions .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
