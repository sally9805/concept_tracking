Dickerson N. Hoover , * supervising inspector general of the U. S. Steamboat Inspection Service , gravely put his name last week at the end of a long document . It was a review of all the evidence given at the inquiry which he conducted into the sinking of the Lamport &; Holt liner Vestris off the Virginia Capes on Nov. 12 , with a loss of in . It blamed the man whose death , clinging to the bridge of the doomed ship , has been called another saga of the sea : Captain Carey . <P> In the emergency , Inspector Hoover stated , loss of life was caused by the " absence of a strong directing hand . " <P> Inspector Hoover 's conclusions were in agreement with those given in U.S. District Court before Commissioner Francis A. O'Neill , by two government experts assigned to the independent investigation there . <P> In his report , which was forwarded to the Department of Commerce , Inspector Hoover denied the prevailing story that the Vestris shipped water first through an illsealed coalport . He declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel through a broken scupper or sanitary pipe . Not until she had a list of 13 degrees or more would the coal ports be submerged . <P> Then , when obviously the ship was in grave peril , Captain Carey should have sent out his SOS . He delayed this too long . The lifeboats were in good condition , but were lowered with difficulty on account of the extreme list of the vessel . " No systematic effort was made to get the passengers into these boats . " <P> When Captain Carey failed , none of his officers took charge . " The officers of this ship do not seem to measure up to the standard that we would expect in a British ship . " And from the whole disaster Inspector Hoover stated there was one great lesson to be learned . Mechanically , nothing went wrong . Humanly , almost everything went wrong . " We must hereafter stress men more than things . " <P> Twelve recommendations were appended by Inspector Hoover to his report . Three of them were that ways should be studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeboat-tackle . <P> Especially significant was Inspector Hoover 's recommendation that admiralty laws be amended reducing the amount of salvage that may be claimed by masters of ships which answer another 's SOS . Inspector Hoover pictured the reluctance of a captain in time of peril to incur the expense of salvage . " If the amount was reduced , the master of a ship in distress would not hesitate too long before asking for help . " <P> Then , considering the possibility that with smaller salvage fees other captains would ignore an S 0 S , Inspector Hoover declared : " It would be easy to place the responsibility upon a shipmaster who refused to respond , and who , refusing , should have visited upon him the severest penalty . " <P> Across the ocean , Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister , President of the British Board of Trade , assured the House of Commons last week that his organization would begin an investigation of the Vestris disaster as soon as arrangements could be made . <P> <P> Among the famed Hoovers of the U. S. , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover , dean of engineering , Stanford University ; brother of Herbert Clark Hoover .
