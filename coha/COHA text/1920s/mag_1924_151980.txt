The Saint . Stark Young ( of The New York Times ) is a critic of the Theatre whose penetrating observation has long been a tonic to our stage . Much to the distress of his admirers , he has attempted to embody the rules and measure of his wisdom in the heart and beauty of a play . Mr. Young has built up the fabric of a well-made drama ; he has strengthened it with a fancy thread of beauty ; and he has wholly failed to fill it with the air of sound reality . <P> His hero deserts the priesthood for the stage . It is the shabby stage of Tip Thompson 's variety show on the Texas border . In its centre is Marietta , gir ! of his seminar ' village . She deserts his studious quietness for the more flagrant physical attractions of Dedaux , the Knife Thrower . " The Saint " has lost his girl and lost his God . <P> Leo Carillo impersonated " The Saint " with stretches of good acting and lapses that were not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who trained pigeons-Maria Ouspenskaya , late of the Moscow Art group . <P> The New York Times- " A play of lofty aim . . . . Moments of beauty ... it came to life only in flashes . " Percy Hammond- " Neither art nor entertainment . " <P> The Crime in the Whistler Room gallantly attempted to be introspective and exceedingly modern and succeeded in being dull . It is the opening production of the season by the group of young and thoroughly intelligent persos of whom Kenneth MacGowan , Robert Edmund Jones and Eugene O'Neill are the leaders . Unhappily , they selected as a starter a complex and over-worded play . <P> The crime is a spiritual slaughter of a highly charged barbarian who is being educated in the current unworldliness of a wealthy home . She seeks solace from the daily burden of propriety with a drink-dishevelled author . Then she dreams . She dreams in a modernistic manner , reminiscent of the weird episodes in The Adding Machine . <P> She dreams in a modernistic manner , reminiscent of the weird episodes in The Adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloister of convention . She dreams that she has fought her way free . She wakes up . <P> None of the acting is very good and none of it very bad . Most of it is accounted for by Mary Blair , E. J. Ballantine and Edgar Stehli . <P> The play will prompt in lowbrows the gnawing of baffled discontent . They will want to know what it is all about . The so-called intellegenzia will find in it flashes of finesse and faithful beauty . The rest is rain and thunder of a very cloudy evening . <P> Alexander Woolcott- " A dauntless production . . . which will probably remain at best in the limbo reserved for distinguished aspirations .
