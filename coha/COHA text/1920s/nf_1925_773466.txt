txt 26o BUSINESS ORGANIZATION or promises to pay , into circulation as money , thus adding to the funds available for investment and lending . The bank also performs many secondary functions of service to its customers . It may operate a savings department ( a special form of deposit ) , a trust department , a safe deposit vault . It acts as agent for the collection of notes and drafts . One class of banks also act as brokers , aiding the customer to dispose of stocks or bonds . The bank also gives financial advice to its clients and supplies credit information on request . CLASSES OF BANKS There are several types of banks which have adapted themselves primarily to performing special classes of services for a particular type of clientele . One line of distinction is between private , state , and national banks . A private bank is one started by an individual or a group , not incorporated , and thus not obliged by the law of many states to conform to the regulations affecting an incorporated bank . Such a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking except that of note issue . Generally such banks lack the prestige of the state and national banks , and , with some exceptions , they are influential mainly in foreign sections where the people are unacquainted with American customs and regulations and prefer to deal with their own countrymen . Because of the fact that in the absence of strict supervision these banks were too often made the means of defrauding the credulous , there has been a movement to bring them under the same state supervision as other banks . Quite a different type of private bank is found in the great individual banking houses , such as J. P. Morgan and Company . These banks are a combination of investment house and bank , confining their attention to assisting in , or taking charge of , the financing of large issues of stocks and bonds for their clients . // The state bank is incorporated under state laws , which differ in various states , but which generally provide for supervision by a state-bank examiner . It operates under somewhat different regulations and can not issue notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects to the national bank , and does a similar type of business . THE NATIONAL BANK The national bank is organized under the National Banking Act , passed in 1864 , which provides that such a bank may be organized by not less than five men , who forward to the Comptroller of the Currency ( an official of the Treasury Department ) a copy of articles of association entered into by them . These articles of association correspond in general character with the application for a charter of a corporation , and an organization certificate is returned by the Comptroller , if the formation of the bank is approved , which corresponds to the charter . Minimum capital requirements are specified , running from $25,000 in towns of 3,000 people or less , to $200,000 in towns exceeding 50,000 people . Shareholders are liable for debts of the bank to an amount equal in value and in addition to the value of their capital stock . The bank can not lend more than ro% of its capital and surplus to any one company or individual , with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national bank under the act was its authority to purchase designated issues of bonds of the United States , to deposit these bonds with the Treasurer of the United States , receiving the interest on these bonds , and to have issued for them , by the Treasury , national bank notes , which could then be loaned out by the bank at the usual rate of interest , thus earning a second profit . A deposit of 5% of the value of the notes must be made with the Treasurer , as a redemption fund , and a small tax is levied on the circulation of the notes . National banks are directly under federal supervision , being examined by // the national-bank examiners . The Federal Reserve System , in which membership is open to state banks as well as national banks , and in which the issue of Federal Reserve notes is gradually taking the place of banknotes , has tended to make the distinction between the national and the state banks of less importance . The state and national banks usually deal in short-time mercantile loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some banks do quite a little of this business , but the usual and primary activity is commercial banking . Often , however , savings , trust , and other departments are added . SAVINGS BANKS The business done by savings banks is more of a longtime character , and such banks are large purchasers of mortgages and of approved types of bond issues . Savings deposits draw interest at from 3% to 4% , and are not subject to check . Thirty days ' notice before withdrawal may be required by the bank if necessary . This relative stability of deposits enables the bank to handle longer-term loans such as those named . Savings banks are organized as stock or as mutual companies , and savings departments are a feature of many commercial banks . TRUST COMPANIES The trust company is organized to administer estates , act as guardian to minors , as trustee of funds and of bond issues , and in similar fiduciary capacities . In doing so it is frequently called upon to invest the funds of its clients , and thus often develops a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiduciary activities . Banks are now very frequently adding trust departments , their acquaintance with a clientele of borrowers and depositors giving them a natural advantage in inducing their customers 1 // to name the bank as trustee in their wills , and to commit other trust matters to its safekeeping . OTHER FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS Similar or closely related to banking are the activities of a number of other types of institutions . Safe deposit companies advertise to the public , fire- and burglar-proof vaults for the storage of valuables , renting these boxes or vaults on a scale of prices based on size . The renter is given a key , which must be used in connection with a master key held by the attendant , to open the box . The contract usually exempts the company from liability in case of fire or burglary , but great precautions are taken against such losses . The building and loan association , already mentioned , is essentially a financial institution . In 1920 the membership of such cooperative associations was nearly five million , and their deposits exceeded two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although not always , connected with a real estate firm , and lends money on longterm loans secured by real estate , selling these mortgages to investors and usually charging a commission for placing the loan . Note brokers specialize in selling short-term notes , say for 90 days or longer , of industrial and other companies . Such notes may be sold to banks or to private investors . Usually one firm of brokers specializes in placing paper of one particular type of business , being thus in a position to pass on the credit of the borrower intelligently and to build up a favorable record as to low losses , with clients . Stock and . bond houses perform a similar function in floating issues of longer term or capital securities . They may buy such issues outright , selling at a profit , or may charge a commission for selling . Some large businesses have found it possible to act to a // certain extent as their own stock and bond brokers . The Commonwealth Edison Company , of Chicago , and others of the Chicago utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiary financing company for the purpose , and pay a commission to employees for selling shares . Stock exchanges are organized in the principal cities for the purpose of trading in shares . Members purchase " seats , " which entitle them to participate in buying and selling on the floor , and trading must conform strictly to rules promulgated by a board of governors , which has authority to suspend or expel any member for violations . Shares are sold on commission . On conforming to certain requirements and meeting the approval of the board of governors , a stock may be " listed " and sold on the exchange . This gives the stock a distinct advantage in the way of a standardized ' market and recognition , which makes it easier to dispose of shares . THE ORGANIZATION OF A BANK A bank is started like any other corporation by a group of men with money to invest . Stock is subscribed and an application made for a charter or organization certificate . The directors of the bank are held responsible to the stockholders for the proper conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to make an examination of the condition of the bank , verifying accounts and inspecting loans which are on the company 's books . The president , vice-president , secretary , and treasurer have duties corresponding to those in the usual corporation . In the larger banks , the vice-presidents frequently act as heads of the various departments . They are often business men , not necessarily with banking experience , chosen for their knowledge of manufacturing , mercantile , trust , or other fields , and expected to get business and supervise the granting of loans in their particular fields . // The executive , or discount committee , is a committee appointed by the board of directors from its number which exercises active authority for the management of the bank , and to which all important loans are referred for approval . The cashier corresponds to the general manager . He supervises all accounting , the work of the tellers and other employees , and deals direct with customers in arranging loans , opening new accounts , and so forth , subject , of course , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more assistant cashiers . There are also one or more paying tellers , receiving tellers , note and discount tellers , a collection department , bookkeeping department , and special departments such as savings , trust , investment ( selling securities ) , and safe deposit . OPERATION OF THE BANK In opening a new account with the bank the depositor introduces and identifies himself and offers funds for deposit . He is asked to sign one or more signature cards for subsequent comparison and identification . He is given a passbook , in which deposits are entered , and a checkbook . Some banks will not accept an account showing an average or a minimum balance of less than a certain amount , or else they will make a monthly charge for carrying such an account , considering that the costs of clerical and other service make the small account show a loss . On the other hand , many banks pay interest , say at 2% , on that part of the monthly balance in excess of $r , 000 . Checks properly indorsed , and cash , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the receiving teller for deposit . Frequently checks are on banks in other cities , and it may be several days before the funds actually are collected . Where this is the case , the bank sometimes does not credit the customer 's account until collection is made . W. H. Kniffinl describes the procedure used in verifying // these checks by the receiving teller . There is frequently a line at the window , and the receiving teller does not stop to verify the totals on the deposit slip , but glances at each check to see that it is indorsed and to catch other possible errors , and leaves the verification for assistants . This verification is often done hourly or at frequent intervals , the checks being sorted into those on local banks , on the bank itself , on out-of-town banks , and so forth . Checks and deposit slips are totaled and should correspond . If not , the error is located and the customer notified , if it affects his deposit . The customer , in indorsing a check , assumes liability for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Care must be used by the receiving teller to avoid counterfeit money and to count correctly . Mail receipts can be handled in a less burried manner . In paying out money a slightly greater degree of responsibility is necessary . Here there is the danger of paying checks on forged signatures or forged indorsements , in which case the bank may be held liable by the depositor . Checks may be stopped for various reasons , such as loss of the check , or fraud in securing the check . In this case the maker notifies the bank in writing to stop payment of the described check . The paying teller must be on the watch for these , also for overdrafts on which payment is refused for lack of funds . Post-dated checks are also to be guarded against , as must be discrepancies or errors made in writing the check . Evidences of fraudulent alteration or raising of the amount must also be looked for . Money is handled by the bank in packages of fixed amounts of one denomination , thus reducing errors and facilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a day of the amounts in the various cages , the paid or received checks balancing the amount paid out . It is the practice in some banks to make no distinction between paying and receiving tellers , one teller acting in both capacities . While this requires a higher type of skill and alertness , it tends to give quicker service to the public . // THE CLEARING-HOUSE Every bank , in the course of a day 's business , receives many checks drawn on other banks , local and in other cities , and these and other banks in turn are receiving its checks . To simplify the settlement of these checks , a clearing-house is organized in about 200 of the larger cities , to which the member banks daily send representatives to clear these outside checks , thus saving cross-payments and unnecessary transportation of funds . In clearing , checks , properly indorsed , are sorted according to bank and placed in envelopes bearing the name of the depositing and the paying bank and the amount . These checks are then distributed to the paying bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank are then balanced , and each bank determines its debit or credit balance with each of the other banks . These balances , between local banks , are settled by direct payment in cash , or in clearinghouse certificates representing money deposited with the clearing-house . It is becoming the custom to settle balances through the Federal Reserve bank , this bank being notified of the amount owed by one bank to another , and debiting and crediting each bank respectively . LOANS The needs for money by a business are of two types . First is the temporary need for money made necessary to finance seasonal increases in business , to meet large payments , and for similar short-time needs . The second type is for more permanent requirements , which amount to permanent additions to working or fixed capital . It is not the function of the commercial bank to meet needs of this latter type , for which the borrower should resort to bond issues or to the sale of capital stock . For needs of the former type the business man will approach the bank with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan or establish a line of credit . When a line of credit is established , it is agreed between bank and borrower that , subject to the maintenance of satisfactory conditions as to credit by the borrower , the bank will lend money as requested up to the amount agreed on as the line , during a given period . In making the application for a loan the borrower may offer security , or may make the loan on the strength of his financial position and the bank 's confidence in his ability and intention to repay . The borrower is usually expected to explain the purpose for which the money is to be used , and to present a statement very similar to that shown on page 227 . The bank will record this information in a credit file similar to that of the mercantile credit man . Loans made by the commercial bank are usually for 30- , 6o- , or 9o-day periods , and the bank is usually willing to renew such loans at maturity if so arranged in advance . It expects the borrower to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affording visible evidence of the fact that the money is not being used as part of the permanent capital of the business . The bank also expects the borrower to keep part of the loan on deposit . The requirements differ , some banks figuring on a minimum deposit of not less than 20% of the loan , others considering the average balance maintained by the borrower . As a matter of fact , a loan is seldom paid to the borrower in cash , but he is given credit on his checking balance for the amount of it . The requirement as to cash balance is not often a hardship to the borrower , since he must have a balance to draw against in any case . It increases the deposits of the bank and has somewhat the effect of collateral , since the agreement gives the bank the right to debit the customer 's account in case of any default . DISCOUNTS A loan is an advance of money on a note , on which principal and interest are payable at maturity . A note , either // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be discounted when the interest is deducted in advance . Most commercial banks discount their customers ' notes . It is sometimes cheaper for the large borrower to sell notes to note brokerage houses than to borrow from the bank , since no deposit is required . A premium ordinarily has to be paid , however , and the borrower does not have the same reserve support which he may expect from a bank . Where right relations are established with a good bank and a record meriting confidence is made , the business man can count on the banker as a friend who will assist him with invaluable advice and counsel and usually support him to the limit in any emergency , in which the bank can act without imperiling the moneys in its trust . SECURED NOTES Many loans are made on the basis of secured notes . Security is commonly of the following types : z . Collateral ? stocks or bonds having a market value in excess of the loan . Stocks usually have printed on the back of the certificate a blank to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , and this blank is indorsed and the stock is deposited with the note at the bank , which is given specific authority , by the terms of the note , to sell or dispose of the stock or bond in case of default of the note or to call for additional security in case the market value of the collateral becomes reduced to a point insufficient to protect the note . The accounting for this collateral and following its market value presents a managerial problem of some importance . 2 . Warehouse receipts , showing good title to grain in storage elevators , produce , or other marketable merchandise in cold storage or other public storage houses , form good collateral , when the goods are marketable and not subject to substantial deterioration or decline in price during the // period of the loan . Since the warehouse receipt is in itself title and calls for the delivery of the goods , no formalities of transfer are necessary beyond the authorization to take title in event of default , contained in the note . 3 . Bills of lading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also often accepted as collateral , corresponding in nature to the warehouse receipt . The usual method is to draw a " sight draft attached to bill of lading " and discount the draft , which is forwarded with the bill of lading to a bank in the customer 's city and must be paid in order to obtain the bill of lading and release of the goods . 4 . It is not the general practice of banks to lend money on customers ' accounts as specific security , but there are many concerns which specialize in this type of loan , and some banks will do so . Mention was made , in the last chapter , of one financing house of this type . The thing may be handled in two ways . Either the customer pledges himself to turn over to the bank , or financing corporation , money as received to apply on the specific accounts assigned , or the account is turned over direct for collection . In the former case , Smith , the customer of the borrower , hears nothing of the transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over to the bank . In the latter case Smith is notified that arrangements have been made for him to pay the bill to the bank , or other financing company . Various other securities are given , ranging all the way from savings banks pass-books to life insurance policies . Real estate and chattel mortgages are also used , but not as commonly on short-term loans . On the " unsecured " loan , the bank is , of course , secured by the whole property of the debtor , which may be levied upon for satisfaction if the obligation is defaulted , but such property is equally subject to the claims of other mercantile creditors , so that the bank runs a certain risk of loss in case of business difficulties of the borrower and must judge carefully as to the dependability of the borrower . // COLLECTIONS The bill of exchange or commercial draft was described in the previous chapter . These drafts are very commonly presented to the bank , either for discount or collection . If the drawer is reasonably certain that the draft will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would a note . If it is simply in the nature of a prod to attempt to induce the customer to pay , it is advisable to ask the bank to forward it for collection and remit proceeds . A small fee is generally charged for this service . BANK ACCOUNTING The accounts of a bank are generally similar to those of any other business institution except for a specialization of the asset and liability accounts . There will be the usual expense accounts , classified as salaries , interest , taxes , expenses of operating the building , stationery , advertising , and so forth . There will be the usual capital accounts , the stock transfer book , and the surplus and capital accounts . Also the usual accounts payable ledger , for general accounts payable . The principal liability of the bank is to its depositors . The depositors ' accounts are nowadays kept on loose-leaf ledgers , machine-posted . Each day 's deposits , and the separate checks , are entered by the machine , picking up the previous balance and carrying it forward . Elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to the correct account . From this ledger sheet the monthly statement is taken off and tallied with the number of canceled checks or vouchers returned to the customer with the statement . In the accounting for loans , a note register is kept , with a page to each customer , on which a record is made of the amount , date , date of maturity , collateral if any , and value , also all payments , constituting a record of the total current liability of the borrower , direct and on indorsement . A // record is also kept of all notes by day of maturity , constituting , in effect , a tickler file for collection . A short time in advance of maturity , notes about to become due are drawn from the files and forwarded for collection to out-oftown banks , or held for payment at the window by the borrower . The application of cost-accounting principles by the bank was mentioned . This is done to analyze the profitableness of various customers ' accounts . The net average balance , deducting checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans , can be found . Interest and other income from the customer are also known . Against this may be set the cost of the service rendered , based principally on the number of checks drawn , at a unit cost per check which covers stationery , bookkeeping , and the general overhead of the bank . Not all accounts which are superficially unprofitable are undesirable . Depositors may be influential in bringing other accounts to the bank , or may be developing into what will eventually become profitable accounts . But this system tells a bank where its deadwood is located , and , as in the case of cost accounts , enables the bank to act intelligently in developing new business . BANK EXAMINATIONS The law requires the examination of the bank at frequent intervals , usually twice a year or oftener , by a state- or national-bank examiner . His coming is unannounced , and the examiner takes charge and seals all vaults . Cash is , verified , notes and collateral are examined for correctness and correspondence with the records of the bank , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A statement is called for as of the day of the examination . The bank 's own auditor may follow the same system of unexpected audit , thus avoiding giving time to cover up any evidence of peculations by theft or juggling of accounts . // THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM The banking system prior to the establishment of the present Federal Reserve System suffered from a number of serious faults . Currency was inflexible in volume , since notes could be issued only by the government or on the basis of government bonds by the national banks . Therefore , at any time of unusual business expansion there was danger of a money panic , caused by a shortage of money which caused the banks suddenly to be forced to refuse to renew loans . Interest rates rose to excessive levels , and gold was hoarded just when it was needed most . A second serious fault was decentralization . Each bank stood alone , except for a measure of voluntary support which had been effected through the clearing-houses . Each bank , moreover , had to maintain its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needlessly tied up and , to a great extent , frozen . The remedy for these and other serious evils was found in the Federal Reserve System . The country was divided into 12 districts , with Reserve banks at Atlanta , Boston , Chicago , Cleveland , Dallas , Kansas City , Minneapolis , New York , Philadelphia , Richmond , San Francisco , and St. Louis . National banks in each district are required to join the system , and state banks may do so . Each bank , on becoming a member , subscribes 6% of its capital and surplus , for stock in the Federal Reserve bank . Only 3% of this subscription has yet been called for . On this stock it receives dividends as earned up to 6% . Beyond this , earnings go into surplus up to i oo % of the capital stock . Above this , ro% of the earnings go to surplus , the remainder to the government as a franchise tax . Each Reserve bank is governed by a board of nine directors , three of whom are elected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks from among business men , the remaining three being appointed by the central Federal Reserve Board . This board consists of the // Secretary of the Treasury and Comptroller of the Currency , and of five members appointed by the President . The Federal Reserve Board acts as a board of governors for the whole system , exercising general supervision over the conduct of the Federal Reserve banks , authorizing note issues and , under certain restrictions , permitting a temporary suspension , for any Reserve district , of the reserve requirements . One of the important functions of the system is the pooling of gold reserves . The reserves of all member banks are deposited with the district Reserve bank . Member banks are required to carry a reserve of 3% against time deposits such as savings bank deposits . On demand deposits ( checking accounts , and so forth ) , local or county banks must carry a reserve of 7% , Reserve city banks , io% , central Reserve banks ( New York , Chicago , and St. Louis ) 13% . Reserves may be shifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are inadequate , by loans from one bank to another . The Federal Reserve banks must maintain gold reserves of 35% against the deposits of the member banks . The Reserve banks deal only with member banks , for ordinary banking transactions . A second function of the Federal Reserve bank is discounting commercial paper for its members . Acceptances , notes , drafts , bills of exchange , banker 's acceptances , may be offered for discount by member banks and held by the Federal Reserve bank , which also has the right to purchase such paper in the open market . Against securities of this character the Federal Reserve bank is authorized to issue Federal Reserve notes , but must maintain a gold reserve of 40% against such notes . The Federal Reserve bank also acts as Fiscal Agent of the United States , the funds of the government being deposited with the Reserve banks . The function of the Reserve banks in clearing the checks of member banks , already alluded to , is a great convenience , which is gradually reducing the amount of exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks . // THE RELATION OF THE BUSINESS MAN TO THE BANK A knowledge of the requirements which govern the bank and of the methods by which it operates should be of assistance to the business man in knowing both the extent and the limits of the service which the bank is prepared to render him . In the face of the possibility of unexpected requirements for money which are so common in business , as well as in consideration of the normal need for short-time loans , it is but a matter of common-sense policy to keep open as many reserve sources of funds as possible . Even where it is not necessary regularly to borrow money from the bank , it is often advisable to make occasional use of its facilities so that credit may be established and the way open to secure money when it is needed . Right relations with a good bank are a distinct asset to any business . XVIII RISKS AND INSURANCE Chance unavoidable . Business hazards . Hazards of the elements . Fire . Failure of materials . Market hazards . Failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Removing uncertainties . Forecasts . Reserves . Transfer of hazards . Deferring commitment . Diversification . Integration of hazards . Insurance . Conditions of insurability . A real hazard . Control by the insured . Co-insurance . Distribution of risk . A calculable risk . Insurable interest . Agencies for insurance . Self-insurance . Mutual insurance . Reciprocal insurance . Stock companies . Lloyd 's associtations . Government insurance . Underwriters ' associations . THE nature of chance was discussed in Chapter VII . Although chance is synonymous with lack of knowledge , it is necessary , in many of the affairs of life , to act with only a partial knowledge of the facts . Business can not be dissociated from the taking of risks , since inaction is often a greater risk than acting , even when a chance must be taken . Chances , however , can be minimized , and one of the important responsibilities of the business man is the reduction or neutralization of the hazards of business . Any classification of the hazards of business has in it elements of artificiality , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is due to the combination of fortuitous elements . While many hazards of business fall outside of a classification or are caused by a combination of causes , the following list will suggest some of the commoner business hazards . HAZARDS OF THE ELEMENTS Storm , flood , hail , frost , cyclone , the ravages of insects and disease , take annual toll of industry . The Weather Bureau and the Agricultural Department have done much to 276 // assist in foretelling and avoiding such disasters , but much remains to be done . Recent investigations seem to indicate the possibility of some measure of prediction of the longer swings of the weather cycle , which would be of great value . The losses caused to agriculture by bad weather and to retailers in the sale of seasonable goods , need not be elaborated upon . FIRE , FAILURE OF MATERIALS The nation annually foots a tremendous bill for fire losses . Failures of materials , collapse of structures , such losses as the spoilage of tools in tempering due to variations in metal or heats , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are all to a degree avoidable , yet not wholly so and they can not be exactly predicted . MARKET HAZARDS A third and large hazard , perhaps the largest of all , is that due to miscalculation of market , and this applies equally to the buying and money markets , and to the selling market . Changes in price , the glutting of markets by good crops or by the entry of new competitors , style changes , the occasional falling off in demand which seems largely to be due to group suggestion arising from some insignificant rumor , the obsolescence of an article due to new inventions or improvements , any one of these causes may upset market plans . This hazard is one which must be considered in making practically all business plans . FAILURE OF INDIVIDUALS Hazards due to the failure of individuals are unfortunately common . Mistakes in judgment , stupidity , incompetence in the performance of tasks , dishonesty , unfaithfulness to a trust , or death or incapacity , are but a few of the personal and moral hazards of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOCIAL AND LEGISLATIVE HAZARDS A fifth group of hazards , which , like the first , is only slightly subject to individual control , includes those arising from unfavorable group action , such as unfavorable legislation , public opinion , and strikes . Often hazards are interrelated , as where incompetent workmen are responsible for a failure of materials , poor salesmen or unwise management for destruction of demand or for unfavorable legislation , careless construction or supervision for fires . No one of these hazards is often exactly predictable . One can never tell just when the right combination of circumstances will happen to produce a fire , or to lose a customer . Where it is possible to know and control the causes , however , part or all of the hazard may be removed . REMOVING UNCERTAINTIES One method of reduction of risk is by thus removing the elements of uncertainty . The value of standardization has been mentioned in this connection . With standard times and controlled conditions , a very material uncertainty is removed from production costs and program . With a standardized and uniform product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( This is subject to a contrary influence , diversification , later to be mentioned . Yet , so far as a variety of articles serve a single demand which would be satisfied with a smaller variety , it is true . ) Hazards may be reduced by forecasting . The studies of the business cycle have contributed in almost revolutionary fashion to the elimination of the old money panics and to the reduction and discounting of periods of business depression . The value of the budget to the individual business in forecasting events has been discussed . Weather reports , market analyses , furnish other illustrations of this method of reducing the hazard by foretelling its probability . // RESERVES A third method of reducing the seriousness of unexpected losses and hazards is by the provision of reserves . In borrowing money for business , a wise man seldom or never touches his last reserve ? up to the very last emergency he has , somewhere , property or credit which can be converted into cash . As Napoleon said , the battle is won by the last reserves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finished parts , of work in process , constitutes a reserve which takes up the irregularities of production and demand . Advertising is often in the nature of preparation of a reserve . A firm may be able to get all the business that is possibly can take care of , yet it advertises , knowing that in unfavorable seasons the good-will built up will protect it in some measure from a falling off of demand , and from price competition which forces prices below the profit line . Just where to draw the line between reserves and active capital or resources is a problem calling for a high degree of managerial discretion . The less the reserves and the greater the proportion of borrowed money to owned money in the business , the more rapid is the turnover and the higher the return on business , assuming the profit rate on the borrowed money to exceed the interest rate . Sometimes large chances must be run . But it is noticed that the man who exercises a moderate degree of caution and conservatism usually stays in business longest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards of business , but they also make it possible to take advantage of unexpected opportunities . The man who can pay cash is in a position to pick up bargains at times . TRANSFER OF HAZARDS A fourth method of reducing hazards is by transfer . " Hedging " is the classic illustration of this method . A // miller manufacturing flour , does not desire to risk speculation in wheat . Yet his large inventory of grain and flour is affected by changes in market prices whether he will or not . So he goes into the market and sells , for future delivery , the same quantity of wheat as he buys , to be delivered at the same time as his flour will be marketed . Then , if the market goes up , he loses on the wheat he must buy to fill his short sales , approximately as much as he gains on the flour , and vice versa . He neither gains nor loses ( except the expense of brokers ' commissions ) but passes on to some one else the risk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing on the risk of an undertaking . DEFERRING COMMITMENT A fifth method of avoiding risk is to defer commitment . The steel mills manufacture principally on sold orders , instead of making first , then selling . This , of course , involves delay in delivery , as from two weeks to six months may be required , according to the amount of unfilled orders ahead , before delivery can be made . To accommodate demands which can not wait , there are steel jobbers and warehousemen who carry all staple sizes in stock and can ordinarily furnish immediate delivery , at a price perhaps 20% or 30% higher . There has been a very noticeable tendency of recent years to shift the burden of risk toward the consumer as far as possible . Wholesale tailors now make up the bulk of their product after samples have been shown the retailer and orders taken . The same tendency is observed in the " hand to mouth " policy of retail buying . Except with remote stores where time and freight costs are a consideration , there is less carload buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carry samples only , in the store , and fill orders from a very small stock replenished daily , or wait to order from the supplier , until the goods are // sold . Not only is the risk of changes in demand and price thus reduced , but turnover is increased . DIVERSIFICATION A sixth method of hazard reduction is by diversification or spreading the risk . The bank is safer than any one single borrower because its risks are distributed . Diversification of investments is a well-recognized rule for good investment . The same thing applies in the granting of credits . The old proverb about " putting all your eggs in one basket " applies here . A basic rule for safe diversification of hazards is to so dispose them that they are unlikely to be unfavorably affected by a single common cause . Thus in making financial investments , it is a good rule not to buy one class of securities exclusively . Investments should be distributed among various classes , such as farm or city mortgages , industrial , railroad , and municipal bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisable . Similarly in taking insurance risks , a dozen buildings in one block , all subject to a single conflagration , constitute a much more serious hazard than the same buildings in different towns . For the same reason , life insurance companies prefer several moderate-sized policies to one very large risk . Wherever possible , it is advisable to keep small enough the amount which could be lost in a single unfavorable event , so that it would not constitute a serious blow to the firm . The same principle applies in trade . Frequently , finding one or two accounts more profitable and easily handled than the small ones , a firm caters to these large accounts and neglects the small ones . The time comes when the firm is quite at the mercy of a single account , and may be forced to accept disadvantageous terms , being absorbed by the larger concern or having prices cut or being thrown on a market quite without connections . // The point is to be considered in choosing a line of business . Although the competition is keen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalize opportunity , such businesses as toolmaking , printing paper boxes , which may serve a great variety of clients , are particularly stable and immune from sudden fluctuations . Mail-order houses and farm-implement manufacturers , catering mainly to farmers , were hard hit by the low agricultural prices of 1920 . It is significant that since that date several large mail-order concerns have begun an energetic campaign for city sales , by chain stores or city stores , by advertising , and so forth . Insurance is one especially important application of the principle of diversification . A fire loss which would be catastrophic for a single firm , is but an incident to an insurance company carrying thousands of such risks and receiving from each a premium , whose aggregate amount more than suffices to pay all the losses likely to occur in a given clientele . INTEGRATION OF HAZARDS A variation of the method of diversification is that of integration . No one can predict the life of an individual , beyond saying that he is certain to die sometime . But if a thousand or many thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately by experience just what proportion of the group will die each year , and what is a total hazard for the individual and his family , is by this process of combination of many risks reduced to a virtual certainty . A modification of the same method is met in the reduction of market risks by control . If many independent producers or merchants operate in a given market , no one of them can tell with certainty what the others will do , or what share of the market will be his . But if the unorganized group of suppliers is replaced by a combination or a monopoly , this risk is totally eliminated and there remains // only the hazard of changes in demand for the product as a whole . Probably one of the directions of social and economic progress during the next century will be in finding ways to secure such integration without the dangers of slackening of effort and abuse of power which so often accompany security . INSURANCE A device of the greatest practical value to business and society is the process of insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certainties by the principles named above . At the cost of a small , certain premium , the large risk is avoided , aiding in the securing of credit , protecting the individual from useless waste of energy in worry , and rehabilitating him in case of disaster . Experience has demonstrated the need for fulfilling certain general conditions if insurance of any type is to be practicable . These are as follows : 1 . A real hazard . There must be a real hazard , of sufficient importance to justify interest by the insured . Depreciation of machinery is a hazard , to an extent incalculable , since any machine may fail before its time . But the average factory uses enough machines , and depreciation is sufficiently regular , so that the factory can count on the retirement from service of machinery according to an approximately known schedule , and the hazard is reduced to a virtual certainty . Wearing apparel is subject to hazards of tearing and other forms of destruction , but it is not a strain on the individual to replace a torn garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is done , however , as in the case of the English gentleman , who , crossing the Atlantic , was drenched by a dash of spray and took depositions from one or two accommodating bystanders . His silk top hat had providently been insured with Lloyd 's before leaving London . // ability is that the hazard must be at least partially beyond the control of the insured . Hail or tornado insurance is a simpler risk to write than fire , because of the extent to which carelessness or deliberate intent may be the cause of fires . The subject of compulsory automobile casualty liability insurance is now receiving attention , because of the necessity of protecting the public from irresponsible drivers who could not pay for damages caused by them . One of the serious objections to such compulsory insurance would be the tendency to stimulate carelessness on the part of the driver . Co-insurance . Where the hazard is partially within the control of the insured , a device for securing caution which is very generally applied is the principle of co-insurance . The term will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it has a special application . But in general , under co-insurance the individual bears part of the risk . Health or disability insurance is a form particularly liable to malingering , and here the provision is usually made that payments shall not be made during say the first week of disability . Similarly in automobile liability insurance it is proposed to make the individual liable in all cases , for an amount , say the first $so , of any damage . 3 . Distribution of risk . A third important requirement for insurance is that there shall be sufficient risks to afford an adequate distribution , and that this distribution shall be so effected that no large proportion of the risks shall be subject to a single hazard . 4 . A calculable risk . The risk must be capable of calculation , at least approximately . Where it is not calculable , so large a premium must be charged that the insured prefers to take his own risk , and even then the insurer may lose on the transaction . Where the chances of the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premium of 5o% , plus expenses and profit , would be necessary . In the case of rain insurance , frequently taken out by large openRISKS // air entertainments , the premium can be figured on the basis of the usual numerical proportion of rainy days , at the time of year of the event insured . 5 . Insurable interest . There must be an insurable interest on the part of the insured . Any insurance in which there is no such interest is in the nature of a bet placed on the happening . Thus it used to be common to insure the lives of public men , to the benefit of individuals who had no connection with them . Policies nowadays usually limit the amount of the loss to be paid ( where this is provable , the value of a life not being of this nature ) to the interest of the insured in the loss . Thus if a building is insured for $10,000 , and is destroyed , and the insurance company can prove that it was worth a less value , the terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loss , whatever the policy face called for . It is presumed that the insured will not pay for more protection than he needs . An insurable interest may lodge in others than the owner . Creditors or mortgagees may insure or be made the beneficiaries of an insurance policy ; businesses may insure the lives of officers , executives , or employees under valuable contracts . AGENCIES FOR INSURANCE There are several distinct types of organizations which furnish insurance . The following are the more representative types : i . Self-insurance . Where a firm owns a large number of scattered properties , none of them subject to a common catastrophe , it may be cheaper to set aside a reserve for insurance sufficient to cover the probable loss , than to pay premiums . Thus a company owning railway cars in use on many roads , or owning chain stores in many towns , would have a sufficiently wide diversification of risks to make selfinsurance justifiable . In the same way many large companies give bond to state authorities , for the payment of // employee-compensation claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The test of the advisability of self-insurance is the ratio of the probable risk to the resources of the company . If this ratio were large enough so that a single loss would prove crippling , self-insurance would be inadvisable. 2 . Mutual insurance . Mutual insurance is a pooling of risks by various individuals , by which , with sufficient numbers , the same advantages of pooled risks are secured as with the private or " old-line " companies . A majority of the life insurance in this country is written by companies mutual in form , although in practice policyholders do not exercise largely the right to participate in management , which is left to a small group much as in the old-line company . Farmers ' mutuals for fire insurance are of some importance , and a frequent activity of manufacturers ' associations is the writing of mutual fire , and employees ' liability , insurance . In the mutual company a loss is settled by assessment on all the members in proportion to the amount for which each is insured . Usually a fixed premium is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the payment of losses and out of which the expenses of running the organization are paid . If , however , this fund should be insufficient , members are liable to an assessment varying from one to ten times the annual premium , to meet the loss . If the fund becomes larger than is needed as a reserve , the balance is returned pro rata as a " dividend " ? not , of course , in the nature of a profit . The premium in most mutual life companies is made high enough to provide , in any normal year , for the payment of such a dividend . Some old-line companies offer " participating " policies , in which a dividend is returned to the policyholder in the same way , in case the losses and expenses of the company are less than an estimated quantity . Many societies and lodges have made mutual insurance a prominent feature of their organization . Originally the scheme of insurance of these bodies was very generally // faulty , for insurance was on the assessment basis , a fixed assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay benefits . As long as all the members were young , the assessments were low , but as the membership aged , the death-rate and assessments went up , until younger members would no longer enter the society . Nearly all the fraternal orders reorganized their insurance plans some years ago , following the lines of the regular companies in establishing adequate reserves and basing premiums on age . While there is a slight element of risk in the mutual company due to the possibility of assessments , the mutual company , when properly organized , has had a general record of being an economical form of insurance . 3 . Reciprocal insurance . Reciprocal insurance is a variation of the mutual plan , in which , instead of placing the management in the hands of an elected board of trustees or similar group , one man is given a power of attorney by each member , authorizing him to act for him under designated restrictions . Each member joins with all the others in the group , in insuring any one member . In this respect it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described . 4 . Stock companies . In the stock or " old-line " company the risk is undertaken for a fixed premium by an association or corporation , and the insured assumes no part of the risk insured . The principal activities of a stock company , activities which are also paralleled in some form in any insurance organization , are as follows : ( a ) Selling . Various types of selling organizations are found . The branch-agency plan is very generally used , general agents or managers being put in charge of large territories , with district agents operating under them . Special agents and field agents are also employed who travel to the agencies to promote business with brokers , help sell difficult risks , and so on . In many of the smaller towns one agent will combine the business of local attorney or real estate man with that of representing several insurance companies . // Much business is also written by insurance brokers , who , in reality , represent the client or insured , in placing the client 's business with any company the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker are paid by the insurance company , however . ( b ) An actuarial department , responsible for the computation of insurance rates , the figuring of the legal reserves ( explained in the following chapter ) , and the large amount of statistical work involved in insurance . ( c ) An investment department , which passes on mortgages , real estate loans , bonds , and other securities purchased by the company . ( d ) A policy-writing department . ( e ) Legal , claims , auditing , bookkeeping , inspection , supply , filing , departments whose functions approximate those of the ordinary corporation . ( f ) A life insurance business would also have a medical department , which would establish the standards for medical examination and approve applications , and a department handling policy loans , refunds in case of lapses of policy , and service to policyholders. ( g ) The executive organization would include the usual board of directors with chairman of the board , president , vice-presidents , secretary , and treasurer . The actuary is often an elected executive officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and officials , for such purposes as the review of claims and applications , for agency and for clerical methods , for review of investments , and similar purposes . 5 . Lloyd 's associations . The original Lloyd 's association was a group which used to congregate at an inn of that name in London , and which is still the largest association . In such an association , the application for any kind of insurance is offered to the members , who decide for each contract offered the extent to which they will participate in assuming liability . The association does not write insurRISKS // ance , but provides , for its members , regulations , uniform policy forms , and a place of doing business , being in this respect somewhat analogous to a stock exchange . Lloyd 's will write almost any kind of insurance , and does a large business in many countries . Lloyd 's associations have been started in this and other countries , but have not attained the degree of success of the original company . 6 . Government insurance . From some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is , however , subject to the dangers inherent in the political control and administration of large funds . The Government of the United States wrote a great volume of life insurance on soldiers in the World War . The theory of the policies was that the soldier paid the same premium as he would have paid under peace conditions ( the government , howevef , paying the expenses of administration ) and the government assumed the war risk of casualty as a substitute for the pensions of previous wars . European governments have embarked on a number of plans of an insurance nature , as social measures . Unemployment insurance , or the " dole , " has been in use in England since the war . A fund is created by equal payments from employers and employees , with a contribution by the government . From this fund , administered by the government , payments are made on a weekly basis to persons out of work . Some of the states in this country provide for state administration of the funds for insuring employers under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . Other state insurance plans proposed include old age and maternity pensions , widow 's pensions , and so forth . 7 . Underwriters ' associations . The trade association is very usefully employed in the insurance field . Various associations ? national , such as the National Board of Fire Underwriters , and local , such as are found in the larger cities ? do much to standardize the forms of policies , secure // uniform practice , fight incendiarism , and represent insurance interests and points of view regarding proposed legislation , in the case of the national groups . The local groups commonly support a joint inspection and rating bureau , which inspects and rates a hazard for the benefit of all insurers , thus securing uniformity of rates and a more thorough classification of the risk than would be practicable to the individual company . The association also serves to promote acquaintance and good-will among insurance men ; it has its professional meetings at which papers are presented and discussions take place on the selling , actuarial , and other phases of insurance . Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tabulation of statistics and the refinement of rating experience . The local association has in many cases carefully prepared , large-scale maps of the city or locality , on which each building is shown , with a code designation of its classification from the standpoint of risk .

Preventive work by insurance companies . WE turn from a survey of the agencies by which insurance may be offered , to the objects which may be insured and types of insurance . LIFE INSURANCE ? COMPUTING THE PREMIUM The computation of the premium on any type of insurance policy is based on the law of probabilities , which is , that the probability of an event 's happening is equal to a fraction of which the numerator is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of ways favorable and unfavorable . For example , drawing from a pack of cards , the chances of drawing a particular card are 1/52 , since there is i chance of drawing it and 51 of not doing so . But the chance of drawing an ace , suit not specified , are 4/52 , since there are now 4 chances of a favorable occurrence out of the 52 possible occurrences . The probabilities of the death of any individual are derived from the American Experience Table of Mortality , which is in general use by life insurance companies , although it is recognized that the values give results somewhat higher than the actual losses . Typical figures extracted from this table are shown in Table 7 to illustrate the problem of ratemaking. 291 For a person aged 30 , the chances of dying within one year would be 720/85,441 , or .00842 , and a net premium of $8.42 would cover this risk for a $1,000 policy for that year only . Similarly , the net premium for a person of 31 would be 721/84,721 , or S8.51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premium paid at the end of the year , and the loss , if any , at the same time . If the premium on a life policy were paid in one lump sum , as it sometimes is , it would be necessary to allow compound interest at 3% or 314% , on each of these sums for the period it was in the company 's hands , and the actual net premium would be the sum of present values ( obtainable from annuity tables ) of the successive annual premiums . To this amount would be added a " loading " or additional sum sufficient to cover the cost of selling the policy and administering the company . To divide this sum into the equal annual payments of the uniform rate annualpremium plan , would involve only an additional interest computation , since the payment on an annual basis gets progressively larger and on an equal payment basis enough more is paid as advance premium in the early years to compensate for the deficiency in the later , years . The actual premium in an old-line company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 at age of 30 , was , on a single-payment plan , $432.50 , and on an annual-payment plan , $23.50 . RESERVES Taking the paid-up policy of $432.50 as an illustration , it is seen that it is in the nature of a trust fund , representing advance payments . Each year the company is entitled to deduct the $8.42 , $8.5r , and so forth , plus loading , earned as an annual premium by the carrying of the insurance for that year . The company is required , by law , to carry a reserve equivalent to the unexpended balance of such prepaid policies . A portion of the level annual life premium must also go into this reserve , which is required to be maintained by the company for the security of the policyholder . Because of the very great amount of clerical detail which would be involved in figuring the reserve at all times due on each policy , approximate methods , based on total sales of policies per month , are employed in actually figuring the reserve . These reserves , which total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company in approved types of securities under regulations having a similarity to those governing savings banks . The insurance company thus performs a banking function to its clients and earns profits as a bank would , by investing money at higher rates of interest than it pays for the money . As a matter of fact , the big insurance companies are among the largest sources of capital for such types of investments as mortgages and bonds . LOAN AND SURRENDER VALUES That portion of the policy which is unexpended for the annual premium is virtually the property of the policyholder and , in case he abandons his policy , most companies provide for its return , minus certain additional loadings designed to cover that portion of the administrative expense as spread over the policy , for which the company is not yet re294 BUSINESS ORGANIZATION imbursed . Or a loan may be made , with this reserve value as security . Or if the insured elects , the reserve may be allowed to stand as prepaid premium , for a policy of the same face for a certain period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new type of policy which has been considerably used is one in which , for a premium paid by an employer , the company agrees to pay a fixed amount , say $I , 000 , or an amount depending on length of service , and so forth , on the death of any employee . It is virtually term insurance , the term being the average period of employment , and is computed on the average age of a group of employees . It relieves the employer of any feeling of responsibility for the pensioning of widows or dependents of old employees , and is used as an inducement to stimulate good-will of employees . SELECTION OF RISKS As contrasted with fire insurance , it has been the policy in life insurance to write policies only on individuals who , by virtue of health , occupation , habits , and other factors affecting the expectation of life , are considered good risks , and a very complete medical examination and history are made part of the application and contract of insurance . Some companies have experimented in writing sub-standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a higher age as a premium basis . Special risks , such as suicide during the first year , service in war and in hazardous occupations , are generally excluded in the policy . FIRE INSURANCE What has been said as to computation of premium and reserves , applies also to fire insurance . There must be an insurable interest , and the company does not assume liabil- // ity for more than the actual amount of the loss , the standard policy containing a clause giving the company the option of replacing the destroyed structure or article with others of like kind and value , taking possession of the damaged property , if desired . The standard policy also excepts from its coverage , " accounts , bills , currency , deeds , evidences of debt , money , notes , or securities , " as well as other special classes of property . It provides that where there is more than one policy in force , the loss shall be divided pro rota among the various policies , the total not exceeding the amount of the loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices , such as the storage of gunpowder or inflammable oils , are prohibited except by specially attached riders giving permission . Either party may cancel the policy at will , unearned premium being returned . The company is relieved of liability during the continuance of such hazardous conditions as repairs , extended vacancy , and so on . Changes increasing the risk are forbidden . Various other provisions cover the method of ascertaining and paying the loss , of protecting the property from further damage after a fire , of notification of loss , and so forth . COMPUTATION OF PREMIUM The writing of fire insurance differs from life insurance in that a great variety of risks are taken . The usual method of computation of the premium is therefore some system of classification or separate consideration of the elements of risk . Various systems are in use . One system is that of classification of risks , such as dwellings , frame , brick , and so on , churches , stores , factory buildings of various types . A more usual system for industrial and business risks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors for the various elements of risk . Thus for a particular town with a given fire protection and fire experience , the base rate for a brick factory building might be 50 cents // per $1oo . For open floor areas greater than I , 000 square feet a charge of 5 cents per $Ioo might be made . For walls of insufficient thickness , for thin flooring , for openings from one floor to another , and so forth , additional charges would be made . An occupancy charge would similarly be computed , corresponding to the hazard of the particular building with an addition for waste or shavings scattered on floor , for open-flame furnaces , and so on , with credits for approved fire extinguishers . In this way a rate is made up which corresponds with the experience of probability of fires , with buildings having similar features . Accurate rate-making requires careful statistical analysis of a great variety of risks , although the application of the rate to a given structure is more or less standardized . This system of rating the elements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by eliminating hazards , he can reduce his premium . CO-INSURANCE The fire insurance policy usually contains a provision to the effect that the company shall not , with all other insuring companies , be liable for a greater proportion of any loss than the amount insured bears to a percentage , such as 8o% , of the actual cash value of the property at the time of the loss . Suppose a building is worth $10,000 and is insured under an 8o% co-insurance policy for $5,000 . Suppose a fire damage of $4,000 . The policy calls for 8o% insurance , or $8,000 . The loss which the company will assume is then 5,000/8,000 = .625 , X $4,000 = $2,500 . The object of this clause is to prevent the insured from taking out a small policy , which would throw the full load of partial losses on the company . RE-INSURANCE A large fire , such as the fires caused by the San Francisco , Japanese , or Santa Barbara earthquake , the Baltimore con- // flagration , or the earlier great fire in Chicago , may entail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily in the district . Policies on single large establishments often constitute uncomfortably large risks . In order to protect itself against such losses , or in the case of a small insurance company to protect itself against any loss greater than its capacity to pay , it is a very general practice to re-insure a portion of the risk . Thus a company may carry with another company or in Lloyd 's a policy covering that portion of a specific loss , or of any loss , over $ioo , 000 or other stated amount . SETTLEMENT OF LOSSES The terms of the policy require prompt notification of the insurance company in the event of lost , and the protection , preservation , separation of damaged and undamaged property , and salvage of the property . Loss is ascertained by an inventory , which may be submitted by the insured to the company , or may be taken jointly . The insured is also expected , within 6o days , to submit a sworn proof of loss , stating the time and origin of the fire , the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the insured , and of all others , in the property , and the use of the property at the time of the fire . The company 's representative usually inspects the property as soon as practicable after the submission of the statement , and examines the inventory and statement . The insurance may be paid without question ; the company representative may offer a lower settlement figure , dickering until an agreement is reached , or the company may make its own inventory or , in suspicious circumstances , refuse payment until an investigation is made . Incendiarism is a crime punishable by imprisonment , but one difficult to establish even when the smell of kerosene is in the air , and the companies have constantly to fight the unscrupulous people who overinsure and burn out , or who burn out to dispose of unsalable t // merchandise or a hopeless business . The writer heard of one case in which a business was for some time offered for sale for $2,000 without securing a buyer . Shortly afterward there was a fire , and we heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascal were not only the insurance companies , but the other tenants whose businesses were interrupted at serious loss , and the firemen , one of whom fell and injured his back for life . In another fire , almost certainly incendiary , eleven firemen lost their lives and several small businesses were ruined to extricate a nearly bankrupt business . In settlement after the fire , a good inventory is of the greatest importance , as insurance can be collected only for those articles whose existence and value can be satisfactorily established . In the case of metal goods and machinery there is usually enough left for evidence , but a perpetual inventory and job-cost sheets which show the present value of work in process save a great deal of trouble and prevent overlooking many things otherwise forgotten or lost in making the settlement . Once a settlement is arrived at , the check usually comes promptly , and most companies will be found very fair in attempting to establish the actual loss and making a settlement with the insured . OTHER TYPES OF INSURANCE Use and occupancy insurance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire or similar causes . Profit insurance covers the loss of profits expected from the sale of goods and prevented by their destruction by fire . Marine insurance is similar in principle to fire insurance but is a very specialized form , due to the special nature of the hazards involved . Automobile insurance may be had to cover liability for damages by injury to persons or to property , damages to the car of the insured by collision or by fire , or loss by theft . Tornado , crop , plate glass , boiler , burglary , and rain insurance are other types . // CREDIT INSURANCE Credit insurance is an insurance against losses by bad debts . It usually is co-insurance , the firm 's normal loss experience being determined and the insurance covering only losses above this limit . It applies only to losses on customers rated by the commercial agencies . In a majority of cases a firm 's credit risks should be sufficiently diversified so that self-insurance should be practicable . TITLE INSURANCE According to present law , it is possible for flaws in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property is transferred . Occasional cases have come up , for example , in which some one would unearth a long-forgotten will and lay , and establish , claim to an immensely valuable piece of New York City real estate . To protect holders it is customary to have a search made of title , going back over all transfers to the original grant of the land by the government or purchase from the Indians . This search becomes very expensive with old properties which have passed through many hands . As a consequence , title companies have been formed in some of the larger cities , which combine centralized records and searches of all titles to property , with an assumption of the remote risk of an undiscovered flaw in the title . Certain risks such as the presentation of valid unrecorded documents affecting the title , and any specific and described flaws discovered in the search , are usually excluded from the guaranty . The policy can not be transferred and , in case of transfer of the property , a new guaranty must be purchased . The Torrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases as a substitute for this system , provides by act of legislature that any person , on payment of a small fee , may register his property , being given absolute possession thereof after publication for a certain period to // give opportunity for objections to such title being given . The fees are collected into a fund for the reimbursement of any claimant who might subsequently show valid claim to a registered property . EMPLOYERS ' LIABILITY INSURANCE Employers ' liability insurance has been mentioned . Most states have laws replacing the old common-law rights of the employee to damages for injuries sustained in the course of employment , and substituting a fixed scale of damages for various injuries , as well as placing on the employer the burden of proof of " contributory negligence " on the part of the employee or his fellow workmen . Such laws also require , in most states , the employer to give bond for performance should an accident happen and an award of damages be made , or failing to do so , to carry insurance with companies prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain percentage of the pay-roll , depending on the rating of the plant as to safety . UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE The Chicago Industrial Federation of Clothing Manufacturers , in October , 1923 , concluded an agreement with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America ( the clothing makers ' union ) by which each factory in the group established a fund , to which employees contributed 172% of their wages and the employer a like amount , and from which all regular employees of a year 's standing or more were paid 40 ; 0 of their regular wage , not to exceed $20 per week or $loo , or five weekly payments , in any one year , during periods of unemployment , after a waiting period of two weeks . The clothing industry is one subject to recurring seasonal irregularities and this experiment was made in an attempt to relieve the worker of a part of the burden of unemployment . Suitable provisions were made for the adminis- // tration of the fund by a board of trustees , for the regulation of the conditions of the award of benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discontinuance of the plan or retirement from business of the manufacturer . BONDING There are many cases where an individual or corporation , acting as trustee or in some other fiduciary capacity such as a guardian , is required to give bond for the faithful performance of an undertaking . Formerly the custom was to ask some friend who possessed enough property to satisfy the court or the other party , to go as surety for such performance . Much of the business of acting as surety , except in the case of criminal bonds , is now done by corporations or bonding companies who , after making a very careful investigation of the character of the obliger , or bonded person , agree to go his bond for a consideration . Bonding is thus not insurance , since it is assumed that the investigation of the character and responsibility of the obliger minimizes risk and the premium is mainly a payment for the use of the credit of the surety . The obliger is also always liable to the surety , for any payment made by the surety because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this liability is not worth much in the case of a criminal default and flight from justice . There is , however , evidently an insurance element because of the incalculability of the default of any individual , and the premium of the bond must include not only compensation for the use of credit and for the expenses of the bonding company , but an insurance charge based on the default experience in a particular type of suretyship . Bonds are required in many situations , of which the following are the commonest : r . The fidelity bond , required , for example , of a watchman , bank employee , storekeeper , and so forth , for the faithful performance and honesty of the employee ; // 2 . The fiduciary bond , required of trustees , guardians , and administrators for the administration according to law or the conditions of the trust , of trust funds , or the property of minors or others , and the due accounting for such funds . Of this nature also are the bonds required of public officials , treasurers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to cover liability of a plaintiff for damages in wrongfully attaching property for debt , or liability to pay judgments , and so forth ; 4 . Depository and warehouse bonds , to secure the repayment or return of money or articles of value entrusted to a bank or warehouse ; 5 . Contract bonds , required frequently in construction work , where there is considerable risk and where contractors often abandon an uncompleted contract . Such bonds indemnify the party for whom the contract is being performed , for losses caused by non-completion ; 6 . Criminal bail , required as security for the production of persons on trial , when required by the court ; 7 . Bonds are required for various other purposes , such as to indemnify a bank against loss in cashing a duplicate certified check of which the original is destroyed , of individuals as a surety that they will keep the peace or comply with court injunctions , immigrant bonds , franchise bonds , marine and customs bonds , and license bonds , which protect the state and the public against damage by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warehousemen , and others . PREVENTIVE WORK BY INSURANCE COMPANIES A very substantial amount of work has been done by insurance companies , by inspection and education , toward reduction of hazards in the respective fields covered . Workmen 's compensation insurance companies inspect premises and recommend elimination of hazards discovered , as well as distributing safety posters , and so forth . A national advertising campaign of education in good health has been carried on for some time by one of the large life insurance companies . In several types of insurance , such as workmen 's compensation liability insurance , a firm is given a t // lower rate on the basis of a favorable experience rating , thus definitely encouraging it to improve its methods in this regard . Much constructive work has thus been done in various lines of insurance . XX FORECASTING BUSINESS CONDITIONS Rhythm , or periodicity , universal . The economic cycle . The period of depression .

Index numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stocks ; money ; production ; market conditions ; business profits . Order of events in the cycle . Business barometers . The use of forecasts in business . A phenomenon which is so universal that it may be called a basic law of nature is the tendency for action to occur in rhythms or waves . A river flowing through a flat , low plain does not cut the straight channel which would be the shortest and most direct outlet for the energy of its flow , but winds into a series of " oxbow " curves and loops which gradually become so extreme as to meet , and cut off islands . An individual , also , does not move from day to day in an even emotional tenor , but today is elated , tomorrow perhaps suffering a reaction of depression . One of the underlying causes of all such rhythms is inertia . The stream , striking the slightest obstacle , is deflected against the opposite bank , from which it is again deflected in ever-sharpening and deepening curves . There is a similar emotional inertia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that overexpends nervous forces , leaving one a prey to depression on slight cause or no cause at all . THE ECONOMIC CYCLE Economic conditions being subject to a similar rhythm , there results a " business cycle , " a tendency for production , instead of remaining steadily adjusted to demand , to swing from one extreme of overconfidence and overproduction , to 304 // a reaction of depression and inaction . Various explanations have been advanced for this variation , and , as a matter of fact , it is probably due to a combination of causes rather than to any single cause . Back of specific causes we can , however , as in the stream or the pendulum , trace an inertia as responsible for the oscillation . The years 1814 , 1818 , 1825 , 1829 , X837 , 1848 , 1857 , 1866 , 1873 , 1884 , 1893 , 1903 , 1907 , 1914 , 1920 have been bad years in American business , those indicated in italic being the years of serious crisis or depression . There is a sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is often interrupted by outside non-periodic events . In a study made by W. L. Cruml the length of the cycle in the case of interest rates on commercial paper was found to approximate 40 months , with irregularities , however , from time to time . The actual cycle , while varying slightly in duration , has a definite and well-marked history.2 THE PERIOD OF DEPRESSION Taking the cycle at its low point as a beginning , the period of depression is marked by generally slow business , low prices , and small profits . There is much unemployment , there is a tendency for wages to sag slowly to lower levels , failures in business are numerous , and interest rates are low . Consumption of goods tends to fall off much more in some lines than in others . Necessities , such as food and articles of small current consumption , are affected but little . Luxuries drop sharply and the sale of articles of comparatively long life falls off because people get along with the old furniture , wear the old suit a little longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money to spend . The banks are usually in a strong position as to reserves during this period , since there is little demand for money // and the banks are cautious in lending . This period is apt to be characterized by a certain amount of undertaking of large projects and public works , for it is a period of low interest rates , low wages and material prices , and those with money to invest are apt to use this opportunity to carry out long-planned projects at bargain prices . On the other hand , concerns with less funds tend to cut down on replacements and capital expenditures . Retail buying during this period is from hand to mouth ; prices remain low and tend to drop lower . RECOVERY Often quite imperceptibly an improvement appears , now in a few lines , now in more and more . Stocks of goods have all been exhausted to the point where they are inadequate and shortages begin to develop . The mills are not yet operating at full capacity and for the moment this shortage leads to no bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or machines into operation and seeks volume to carry the overhead which has been devouring his profits . Unemployment decreases and retail stores begin to feel the effect in increased buying power . Bank loans increase , although there is still enough idle money to keep interest rates low . Here and there wages begin to rise . Here and there a business man 's orders begin to run ahead of productive capacity , and he decides that it is safe to raise prices a little . EXPANSION The immediate effect of the increases in price is to decrease buying . But as demand continues steady as a whole , more and more firms decide that the time has come to increase profits , or are forced to higher prices by increases in wages and in the costs of their materials . Gradually the impression gets abroad that prices are going higher . The grocer says , " Better order a hundred pounds of sugar , // madam . My jobber tells me that it may go up again any day . " Speculators begin to buy and hold or hoard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already at its maximum , is augmented by extensive taking out of the market of goods being held for a rise . Production , which at first raised but a hesitant note here and there , is now swelling into a full-throated symphony of profit , with here and there a discord as strings are stretched too tight . There is a shortage of labor , a shortage of materials . Manufacturers begin to bid up the price of labor , and the workman , finding himself sure of a job , yields to the natural impulse to take things a little easier . Absenteeism , insubordination , strikes , and careless workmanship increase rapidly . They tell of an employment manager , during the height of the boom of 1919 , who was in the habit of accosting every man he met and asking him if he wanted a job . One day he met one of the workmen from his own plant but did not recognize him . " Got a job ? How much are you getting ? " " Seventy cents . " " Come around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you seventyfive . " High prices and volume of demand bring low-grade mines on the market . Copper ore which can not be hauled to the smelter at 15 cents , shows a profit at 25 . Everywhere , obsolete machinery , damaged materials , cripples and incompetents are being pressed into service . Transportation facilities are overtaxed ; there may be an embargo such as the freight embargoes of 1919 . Interest rates begin to rise . Building slows down , for building is a long-time investment and investors become cautious about investing at the high prices and with inefficient and troublesome labor . Factory construction , however , tends to hold up almost till the last . Gradually a new phenomenon appears as merchants find that they can not get early deliveries . They place perhaps six orders for the same article with six firms , intending to cancel five as soon as the first is received . // LIQUIDATION By this time the inertia of the movement has carried production out of all relation to demand . Hoarding stops because of the natural limits of capacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its inventory overextended , and the bank asks it to reduce its loans . Production has been becoming more inefficient and costly and people on fixed incomes begin to feel the pinch of higher costs , and curtail purchases . Contracts are canceled here and there , and , suddenly , the pendulum which has been swinging higher and higher comes to a rest , and begins to recede . There is a rush to unload on the part of speculators big and little , a rush of cancelations passed down the line . Interest rates suddenly rise as banks begin to call in loans , and there is a desperate scramble for money . Depending on circumstances , the liquidation may at this time take on the characteristics of a panic , or it may be possible to hold it to a more orderly recession . In 1907 the panic was precipitated by a failure and an actual shortage of currency ( the Federal Reserve System not then being in existence ) . Credit overnight was violently deflated , there was a scramble for money which was suddenly taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emergency currency , such as clearing-house certificates , was put into circulation and there were many failures . If the deflation can be kept under control , the banks continue to support loans , giving the merchant a chance to liquidate with a minimum of loss . The weakest concerns fail , the weaker ones suffer drastic " reorganizations , " and the strong concerns , while suffering actual immediate losses , are improving their position in their markets . All through this period there is a desperate effort to hold up prices , which fails in some instances but is successful in many . The decrease in volume of demand is felt in output rather than price , and the hoarded and excess stocks hang like a cloud over production until they are finally used up . // Wages remain high but unemployment is sharply felt . Labor , fighting on instinct to hold its gains , is troublesome , and strikes are frequent . Manufacturers , faced with the everpresent problem of burden , are the first to make the price concessions that everybody is trying to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cuts while maintaining the retail price , so that while his volume is greatly reduced his unit profit is larger . But gradually competition forces reductions here also . For a time business hangs on a dead center . Everybody holds off buying as long as possible in the expectation of still further price cuts . Failures continue heavy , as firms which weathered the first blast reach the end of their resources . A realization of a real scarcity of jobs makes workmen who have them anxious to retain them , and labor efficiency increases and labor troubles almost disappear . Extravagance is disappearing , and the initial period of recovery and slow gain is again in sight . CAUSES UNDERLYING THE CYCLE Various explanations have been given for the periodicity and cyclic nature of this phenomenon . One of these has already been suggested , the tendency for a swing from underproduction to overproduction , owing its origin partly to the influence of price and in part to the fact that the plants , equipment , and capital assets , which are directed toward supplying a shortage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goods until these productive assets have been used up . Were oversupply and depression of prices the sole cause of deflation , price reductions would precede , instead of following , the deflation . But speculation , the anticipation by business men of the approaching condition of oversupply , operates to discount price depression and profit reduction . The influence of our credit system is also felt . During prosperous times the banks tend to overextend credit and a point is reached at which further loans can not // be made , suddenly interrupting the process of pyramiding prices and production , which has been developing . The subject of the cause of the cycle is still not a fully settled one . There is an interplay of many forces , partially those of investment inertia , partially the forces of group suggestion and hysteria , partially forces extraneous and accidental . NON-PERIODIC FACTORS Other forces enter to complicate the pattern . A good crop year or the discovery of gold may shift the period or break the rhythm . The United States in 1914 was on the verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war orders from Europe . Good or bad legislation , such as the refusal of a charter to the First Bank of the United States in 1811 , the coinage act of 1834 , which disturbed the ratio between gold and silver and induced the export of gold , the bimetallic policy of the United States in 1893 , and the Federal Reserve Act in 1914 , may accentuate or reduce the normal tendency . THE PRODUCTION OF GOLD A long-term swing has been pointed out , culminating in each of the major war periods . The period of 1800-1814 was one of very general martial activity , the Napoleonic Wars and our own War of 1812 . It was marked by feverish price increases and was followed by an equally sharp drop , then by a long gradual sag of prices , with an upward tendency commencing about 1835 and accelerating until the early 6o 's , which were marked by the Civil War , and by the Franco-Prussian , Crimean , and other European wars . Following this period was again the sharp , then decreasing rate of price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle 90 'S and culminating in the World War of 1914-1918 . Edward Beach Howell points out , in a thoughtful artiFORECASTING // de , ' the possible connection of these great war periods with the sudden increases in the world 's production of gold , which he shows have coincided through a long period with the periods of special military activities . His explanation is that the sudden increases in gold supply were accompanied by a cheapening of gold , or its equivalent , a rise of prices . This , in turn , stimulated trade , excited commercial rivalry , and caused wars . Professor Irving Fisher some years ago proposed a plan in which the standard of value would be composite , consisting of measured quantities of a variety of articles of common use , such as lumber , wheat , meat , metals , and so on . Paper money would still be used as the medium of exchange and would still be redeemable in gold , but the weight of gold paid by the government for a dollar of certificate would vary with the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of the commodities goes up , it is an indication that the price of gold has gone down , and more than 25.8 grains would be given for a dollar . While it is difficult to change established institutions , the world may some time be forced to adopt a more stable unit of value than gold . Any particular economic situation is affected not alone by these various general periodic and non-periodic factors , but it is affected by many local influences . It is curiously interesting to watch the short-time fluctuations of trade ? this month , retailers all report good business , next month there is a pause , the next month all is activity again . The year 1923 was a record business year , almost as great money volumes of business being done as in 1919 . But in December of that year or January , 1924 , sales stopped sharply , and the dullness continued through 1924 . With all these various factors affecting the cycle , influencing its severity and affecting its length , prediction of the cycle bears some slight analogy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , we can // trace many of the secondary influences in a particular case and we can predict the order but not the exact time of the events in the cycle . We may also establish a connection between those factors which come earlier in the cycle and those which come later , thus making possible a partial short-time prediction . METHODS OF FORECASTING There are two methods of analyzing the probabilities in any particular stage of the business cycle . The first of these is an analysis of the situation from the standpoint of the economic factors involved . This method contemplates the identification of such factors in the situation as an overproduction of particular commodities , or the influence of immigration restriction on labor prices , costs , and foreign trade , the effect of increased taxes , or of such other factors as may be recognized as acting in the given case . The influence of these factors is then evaluated and a prediction is made . Like the weather prediction , this may indicate conditions which make a thunderstorm probable , but we can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be realized . The other method employs the statistical method of correlation . If one or several observable movements , such as price changes , can be proved by statistical comparison to vary with the changes of the cycle in a known manner , then , without needing to establish precisely the relationship between cause and effect we may say that as long as the situation is not changed by new elements , such movements or indicators may be taken as a fairly reliable index of the economic situation at the time . This is the method used in preparing the Harvard index , later described . Experience has shown that the prices of industrial stocks , for example , change some months in advance of the wholesale prices of commodities , and these , in turn , usually in advance of retail commodity prices . // INDEX NUMBERS One of the most reliable indicators of the tendency of the cycle is the price of the various commodities . A single commodity may be influenced by so many special factors that its price is not as reliable an index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such series of price index numbers , of which the most important are the United States Department of Labor 's index of wholesale prices and Bradstreet 's index of wholesale prices . Bradstreet 's index is a composite figure obtained by adding together the wholesale prices of 96 staple commodities , reduced to a per pound basis , divided into 13 groups , a separate index of each group , and for the total , being published . The Department of Labor 's index of wholesale prices is based on the prices of somewhat over 400 commodities each weighted in proportion to its commercial importance , and is stated in terms of the percentage of the price of 1913 . It is found , however , that the unweighted index , such as Bradstreet 's , serves nearly as well as an indicator . INDEXES OF BUSINESS CONDITION The following list embraces some of the most important of the business conditions commonly used as indicators of the general business trend : Agricultural conditions . Agricultural conditions do not in general correspond to the business cycle , because they are affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythms . The length of time required to mature live stock , orchards , and other crops , the weather , crop shortages , and other factors , have a predominant weight . For this reason agricultural conditions are useful more as indicating one of the factors affecting prosperity , than as indicators of the cyclic trend . Agricultural production and prices of the principal crops ? wheat , corn , cotton , live stock ? are the statistics of principal // importance . Government reports are issued eight times a year , giving the estimated condition of the wheat , cotton , and other crops , and prices can be obtained from market reports of prices paid in the various markets and produce exchange . Shares and stocks . The prices of shares and stocks give one of the earliest indications of business changes , since they reflect a combination of the opinion of experienced investors all over the world , and of tendencies known or felt by those actively in business . Such stocks may be classified as industrial , mercantile , rails , and public utilities . Industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation , the General Electric Company , the various automobile companies , and many other industries , are the most sensitive to coming adjustments in the business situation , a turn in the market usually preceding by about six months a change in the business situation . Mail-order stocks reflect agricultural conditions to a degree . Rail and utility stocks are usually slower to respond . Money . The interest rate , volume and disposition of currency are matters of very great interest . Bank clearings follow rather than precede business movements . Bank statements , also published by the Federal Reserve banks and by individual banks , may be analyzed to show very clearly the amount of loans outstanding and the condition as to contracted , normal , or inflated credit . The volume of Federal Reserve notes and other note currency in circulation is another indicator of the same condition . The reserve ratio of the Federal Reserve banks also is of interest . Gold movements between nations are also significant in indicating volume of trade and adjustments of international finance . Interest rates are very significant , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating a probable inflation . There are several rates of interest , on various types of loan , as follows : ( 1 ) The call loan rate , which is the rate paid on the New York Stock Exchange on money // borrowed and subject to payment on demand ; call loans tend to indicate speculative conditions rather than general business conditions ; ( 2 ) the Federal Reserve rediscount rate , applying to the rediscount of commercial paper presented by banks ; ( 3 ) the rate on current 30- , 6o- , and 90-day loans by the mercantile banks ; ( 4 ) the rate on prime short-term notes or commercial paper , offered , as before described , on the open market by industrials ; ( 5 ) the interest rate on bonds of the first grade . Production . Of the various statistics of production which are available as indexes of the trend of business , those relating to iron and steel are of special interest because of the extent to which this product enters into other products , and to which the demand for steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pig-iron production is the basic process through which all steel must originally pass , hence the figures of monthly pig-iron production , published by the iron trade magazines , are watched with special interest . The volume of unfilled orders of the United States Steel Corporation is published quarterly and affords a good indication of the trade situation . The production of coal , the volume of imports , the amount of new building , by classes ( residential , business , industrial ) , are also available and of interest . Labor conditions also afford an excellent index of the production situation . Many of the various states and the United States Department of Labor regularly publish statistics showing the amount of unemployment , a reliable index of activity . The Department of Labor of the state of Illinois publishes a figure of interest , compiled by its Free Employment Bureau , and showing the ratio of applications for jobs , to applications for employees . Wage rates are published by the United States Department of Labor . Wage rates tend to lag behind the general cyclic trend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barometric standpoint . Market conditions . Among the various indicators of // market conditions perhaps the most important is commodity prices , which quickly reflect changes . Wholesale prices are more sensitive to changes than retail prices . The United States Department of Labor index of wholesale prices and the Bradstreet index have been referred to . The volume of transactions is indicated by sales of mail order and of chain stores . Freight movements are also significant , and idle cars , car loadings , and gross earnings of railways are available as indicators . The volumes of exports and imports are also of interest . Business profits . Earnings of corporations are available , but reflect conditions some months past . Business failures , while including only bankruptcies and insolvencies , and not those businesses which have been found unprofitable and wound up without loss to creditors , are a very satisfactory indicator of business conditions , tending to give an early indication of favorable or unfavorable conditions . While not directly an indicator of business profits , savings bank deposits , amount of new insurance written , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating the general prosperity . ORDER OF EVENTS IN THE CYCLE The factors just named may be classified according to the sequence in which they take place , especial significance attaching to those indexes which come before the general change in the situation . Among those items which tend to precede the general body of symptoms may be named the prices of industrial shares and stocks , and wholesale prices . Among those factors tending to accompany the general change are the production of pig iron and volume of unfilled steel orders , the amount of unemployment , bank clearings , retail sales , and business failures . Among those factors which come late in the cycle or follow the general movement are changes in wage rates , retail prices , interest rates , bank reserves , and corporation profits and dividends . // figure Agricultural figures , as stated , have an important and sometimes determining influence on prosperity , but do not follow the same cyclic law . It is of very practical interest to classify one 's business as to how it is affected by the cyclic trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail trade , late , some experience a reverse effect . Newspapers and other publications usually suffer during periods of increasing circulation , for the actual publication is very often sold below the cost of production and profits are based on advertising , whose price in turn is based on the older , smaller circulation figures . It is sometimes possible to establish a relationship between prosperity of the business and some special factor . The relation between rural prosperity and the sale of agricultural implements is clear . // BUSINESS BAROMETERS A composite picture of business tendencies may be presented by selecting several representative indexes of condition and combining them . There are several such barometers published , among which may be mentioned the Harvard and Babson barometers . The Harvard index of general business conditions is a series of three curves , an " A " curve for speculation , a " B " curve for business , and a " C " curve for money . ' The following items are used as the basis for the three curves : " A " curve , speculation : New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " curve , business : Bank debits of 140 cities outside of New York Index of prices of 10 sensitive commodities " C " curve , money : Interest rate on 4-6 months ' commercial paper The figures for these three groups are presented by curves , with a combined curve . The Babson " compositplot " is based on index figures for immigration , new building , failures , check transactions , commodity prices , total foreign trade , foreign money rates , domestic money rates , yields of principal crops , railroad earnings , Canadian conditions , and stock market conditions . The curve representing the composite tendency of these elements is plotted and compared with a base curve representing the long-time tendency of business to increase . An interesting feature of the Babson curve is the theory on which future developments are predicted . This theory is that , while the violence of the cyclic swing above or below the base curve of the long-time tendency may vary from cycle to cycle , the area enclosed by the curve above and below the line tends to remain constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Review of Economic Statistics , Harvard Committee of Economic Research . // may be of some assistance in predicting the probable appearance of a change in conditions , it is subject to so many uncertainties , such as a change in the base line , and has so little fundamental proof of the assumption that " action equals reaction " that it is open to question as a scientifically correct method of prediction . A great many summaries of business conditions are available . The Federal Reserve banks publish , in monthly bulletins , a very useful summary of business conditions , and many of the larger banks publish and distribute similar summaries on request . The United States Department of Commerce publishes a very complete and useful Survey of Business Conditions . THE USE OF FORECASTS IN BUSINESS The business depression of 1920 emphasized the value of a prophetic study of business tendencies . When the crest of the boom was past , many companies found themselves loaded with heavy inventories on which tremendous depreciations had to be taken , or committed to orders which they could not use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from more serious losses . A few companies had followed old Colonel Vanderbilt 's motto of " letting the other fellow take the last cent " of the profit from a rise or fall in prices , and had put their houses in order by cautious buying and restraint of expansion . One of the companies which took to the storm cellar in time was the Dennison Manufacturing Company . The Dennison Company during the boom period followed a policy of developing a variety of new lines , which were not put on the market during the boom . Salesmen were familiarized with these lines and an aggressive sales campaign was planned , which was all ready to launch as soon as the first flurry of the crisis had passed , and which enabled the company to hold up its sales without serious interruption during the years of the depression .

A MANUFACTURING business is a " typical " business such as the one we have been assuming in the previous chapters , plus a production department . Manufacturing involves a merchandising problem , organization , finance , accounting , purchasing and storage of materials , credit management , and the activities we have been describing as typical of businesses in general . It is subject to the same laws of good management . Rapid turnover , high unit profit per turn , planning in advance of performance , analysis and control of expense , the anticipation , allowance , and provision of protection for risks , all apply to it , with the addition of its own special problems , technical and administrative , made necessary by its task of production . Sometimes manufacturing is but an incident to mercantile operations . The Jewel Tea Company is primarily a wagon distributor of teas , coffees , flavoring extracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffee roasting , grinding , and packing department which is a true factory . Sometimes the financial and mercantile departments are quite secondary to the problem of production , as in the case of the Western Machine Tool Works , which sells the entire output of its specialty , machine tools , to a single jobber and does not directly concern itself about sales . In this and the succeeding chapter we will be concerned with production . 320
