The Secretary of the Treasury , particularly , " the greatest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton , can not afford to indulge in wishful thinking . Financiers were inclined , last week , to be instructed , rather than startled by what financial writers called Secretary Mellon 's " bold " plan for refinancing the Third Liberty Loan which matures in September . With the money market hitting its highest since 1920 Secretary Mellon offered to exchange 3 ? % bonds for the 4% Third Liberty Bonds , which mature in September . He gave the new bonds a life of 12 to 15 years . Like most Government securities , they were only partially taxexempt . The conclusion was that no matter how high money may be now , Secretary Mellon believes that 3 ? % will be a sufficiently attractive rate to keep Government bonds near par from now till 1940 . In other words , in Mr. Mellon 's judgment , a decade of " easy " money lies ahead . <P> The retirement plan for the Third Liberties was consistent with Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , 1927 , about one-sixth of the 4% Second Liberties , then outstanding , were retired by an issue of 16-to-20 year bonds , bearing only 3 ? % . This year 's offer was to retire at 3 ? % as many 4% Third Liberties as people cared to bring in for exchange , and besides to sell for cash $250,000,000 worth of the 3 ? % bonds , or about one-fifth the amount of Third Liberties outstanding . <P> To make the exchange offer more attractive , the Treasury promised to pay the interest on Third Liberties turned in during the balance of their life . <P> To make the cash offer more attractive , the Treasury announced that no other long-terms bonds would be offered in connection with the Third Liberty Loan . <P> Inside of 24 hours , the cash offer was oversubscribed by $475,000,000 . Provident owners of Third Liberties hastened to convert their holdings before July 31.
