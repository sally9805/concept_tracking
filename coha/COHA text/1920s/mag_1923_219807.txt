Mr. Ramsey Macdonald , British Labor Leader , in a recent number of the Socialist Review animadverts upon riotous behavior in the House of Commons : " I detest these scenes . One heated furnace of a man can lead the legitimate calls of ' adjourn ' into the badly sung strains of Rule Britannia or The Red Flag or Tipperary or fisticuffs and not only make a fool of himself but degrade everyone associated with him . Fascism was stimulated into life by communist tactics . " <P> Herewith two verses of the Red Flag : <P> " The people 's flag is deepest red ; <P> It shrouded oft our martyred dead ; <P> And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold , <P> Their heart 's blood dyed its every fold . <P> Chorus : <P> " Then raise the scarlet standard high ! <P> Within its shade we 'll live and die ! <P> Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer <P> We 'll keep the Bed Flag flying here ! <P> " It waved above our infant might . <P> When all ahead seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vow , <P> We must not change its color now . " <P> Chorus as above .
