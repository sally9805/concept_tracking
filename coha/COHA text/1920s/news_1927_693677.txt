txt A very interesting artele might be written Upon the subject cf the mi gralions of authors . They ! tilt about the earth nowadays in B. m 0 a t amazing manner , and are to be found as a rule almost anywhere but at home . For example , when I come to America I a/ways meet there English authors whom I never , or hardly ever , see at home ; and when I am in Eng ' land I see American authors whom I have never seen in America . When I first came to America , three years ago , I saw both Miss Rebecca . West and Mr. W. L. George in New York , whereas I had barely met either of them in the old world . I have never seen Mr. Sinclair Lewis In America , but always in England . One has to go to France to see Mr. W. J. Locke and Mr. I. D. Beresford , to Italy to see Mr. Aldous Huxley , and sometimes to Africa to see Mr. Brett Young , or as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in London , and Mr. Arnold Bennett Is out of it  --  not that there is any connection between Mr. Lewis ' arrival and Mr. Bennett 's absence , for the two men are very good friends , and Mr. Lewis has no more sincere admirer than Mr , Bennett .

He has been a very hard working journalist all his life , and for twenty years had the weight of editorial responsibility upon his shoulders  --  he edited the London Daily News for that time ? , so it is only right that he should now have occasional holidays . -. - Another liberal ex-editor , Mr. J. A. Spender , who edited the Westminster Gazette when It was an evening paper printed upon pale green paper , and for this reason ( as well as the famous Integrity of its editor ) had the name of " the pea-green incorruptible , " is also shortly going upon a great jourrly .
