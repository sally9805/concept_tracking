ON THE street this week we unexpectedly came face to face with Mr. Noel Coward , the agreeable English actor , and were shocked and surprised to observe that he was carrying a bundle . He looked distressingly like a commuter . We need not say that carrying bundles is hardly in the best tradition of the English stage , and we might sound a note of warning to the effect that the American Public will not stand for much of this sort of thing in its idols. 9- ' ? HE enterprising I. Miller shoe I store , he it recorded , at Forty-sixth Street and Broadway , has caused to be put on the outside of its establishment four niches in which eventually will stand statues of America 's best-loved actresses .

WITHOWITHOUT question the thrill UT the fall book season was furnished by Putnam 's book store in Forty-fifth Street , in the window of which was displayed the fur coat recently worn in the arctic by David Binney Putnam , the boy author . That New York should he allowed to see the garments worn by this celebrated prodigy is something for which we should give thanks .

Not only does the city house its creatures in shockingly shabby houses , under eroded corrugated tin roofs and behind bars that look rusty enough to give way , but also it fails to label most of the animals ' cages . A father is hard put to it to name the more recondite specimens like yaks , tapirs and zebus , while the polar bears , bison , and other obvious beasts are carefully tagged .

It was Mr. Gleason who  --  newly established in our midst as an authority on slang ? was asked last year to be a speaker at the annual banquet of the Drama League . And it was Mr. Gleason who , knowing what the august League would expect , planned a surprise . " These birds , " he told an erudite acquaintance , " will be looking for something in slang ; all right , I want you to write me five pages of the most high-sounding blab you can think of . Not a one-syllabled word in the speech . I stand up  --  I 'm wearing tortoise-shelled glasses with a black stringsee  --  and I reel off this speech . These nuts do n't make me , get me ? And then two minutes before I sit down I purposely let my glasses slip off and finish with a sentence in slang . That 'll lay the mob right in the aisle . " The speech was written and stuffed with Latin phrases and pedantic language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gleason spent a good two days memorizing it . The day after the banquet the author of the discourse asked the comedian how he made out . " Rotten , " said Gleason , " I was a flop . The speaker before me was Otto Kahn .

' Bigger and Bigger WITHWITH THE satisfaction that the late horse show was the biggest and best in the world , the officials are already telling people that next year 's will be even bigger . 1925 was an off year for the show ; everyone held their breath for 1926 . Mr. John Bowman , the new President , went abroad and was a judge at the Olympic show in London and came back to institute , among other things , the Olympic course , that maze of eight jumps over which the colorful international competitors jumped or did n't jump .

Even with the additional space of the New Garden , the promenade before the boxes was dropped in anticipation of attendance so large as to make it impractical because of overcrowding , an expectation justified by the sensational figures of eight to ten thousanda night . Characteristically the new order speeded the mechanics of the show , trundling equipment in and out upon carts spun along by magnificent dray horses with postillions in gay uniforms . The Garden 's electric scoreboards and announcers kept the crowd informed . The reward for it all was an array of opera hats astonishingly large even for the big Horse Show .

Regrettable , too , was the emptiness of the top galleries , but that was not the committee 's fault . A decade ago one saw up there the great proletariat of horsedom  --  the cabbies , coachmen , stablemen  --  leaning out of their aerie , more interested and more conversant by far than the box-holders . No more will they be seen  --  for their day is done . ? A LADY reports that when a Lex- ington Avenue local tore unhesitatingly past all stations , from Thirty-third Street to Eighteenth Street , she complained to the guard .

Five Dollars FOR THE information of those Christmas shoppers who have felt it necessary to restrain themselves while gathering in the countless tempting purchases at any of Mr. Woolworth 's gay shops , it may be helpful to note that the company will deliver goods bought on the ten-cent counters if the total reaches the $5 mark . Not only that , but a basket will be provided for your use while collecting the five dollars ' worth  --  or even a porter to carry the basket , in case it becomes too heavy .

She was there as Gatti 's guest , and she is said to have " embarrassed " Scotti when she suddenly encountered him as she left by the stage door . However , this does n't seem to mean that Farrar is returning to opera . In-de ed , it is whispered in other quarters that there has been no misunderstanding , and that she was simply another of those ladies like Fremstad , who were n't sopranos at all , but who forced their voices into soprano roles and who are now paying the penalty for it . Which brings up the query , where are the opera singers of yesteryear ? So many of them seem to disappear . Numbers of them , of course , retire to the less arduous task of teaching . Sembrich , for instance , is at the Curtis Institute , Charles Dalmores , the leading French tenor , is in Chicago , and Melba is teaching here in New York . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for writing their autobiographies . Lilli Lehmann , Emma Calve , Louisa Tetrazzini , Blanche Marchesi , Clara Louise Kellogg , Geraldine Farrar and Maria Jeritza all have published their memoirs . Others , it is said , are still dictating . Not a few former Metropolitan stars have retired altogether , to rest " He never acts this way when he has his sleep . " " Its fragrance , sir , is positively intoxicating . " Reporters have been sleeping in cellars , photographers in bathtubs and kitchens which , in the daytime , have been converted into dark-rooms . The Daily Mirror , the tabloid accused of bringing about the recent trial , has been maintaining a menage for a staff of ten men , which number includes the important editors of the paper . The household staff , according to our Stars THERE IS whispering of a re- -1 . cent " reconciliation " at the Metropolitan , brought about by Geraldine Farrar 's first return to the Metropolitan in several years .

Most of these own villas in France and Italy and appear in public only occasionally for charity . Madame Tetrazzini , now in the fifties , but recently married to a youth of twenty odd , owns villas in Florence , Rome and Lugano . Calve has a chateau in central France , though she sometimes appears in Paris for a concert , and she also does some teach- ing . Olive Fremstad lives quietly in Maine , where three of our most famous American singers were born . Annie Louise Cary , Lillian Nordica and Emma Eames all came from there . Emma Eames , incidentally , is one of the few sensible prima donnas who have retired at the height of their glory . She decided that most singers do n't retire early enough , so in 1906 she hied herself to Paris with her husband , Emilio de Gogorza , the baritone , and she has been living there ever since , except for a few years spent in Bath , Maine , during the war . She is close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have a more beautiful voice than ever . It was Eames , by the way , who , when she returned to America a few years ago and was met by a battalion of reporters , asked that the representatives of the Hearst papers please step forward . They complied , with eagerness , in hopes of a good story . " Well , now I know what you look like , " the singer said . " You may go home . " ? Cause and Effect TUDENTS of psychology will be 0 interested in the story of a Wall Street financier whose innocent experiment in medicine cost him the services of his office force for a morning . Afflicted with a minor ailment , he called his physician , who took his temperature and reported it as ninety-nine , but added " there 's nothing-the matter with you many people 's normal temperature is well over the usual ninety-eight . " The financier was sceptical , so en route to the office the next day he bought a thermometer and , one by one , called his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took their temperature . His right hand man showed ninety-two print two , his secretary nearly ninety-nine , a stenographer just a degree above normal . Satisfied , he put up his instrument and settled to work . But within fifteen minutes his secretary appeared , announcing that she had developed a severe headache and she was going home . His assistant entered with a similar tale , but showing symptoms of a genuine stomach-ache . And shortly afterwards the stenographer left , too , having dizzy spells . A telephoned explanation that the thermometer used had been defective brought all three of them hack within an hour . The instrument was found , we hear , in the gentleman 's waste-basket that evening . Service IF YOU are one of those who score 100 on all the " Are You A New Yorker ? " queries , you will consider the problem of how to find the nearest cross-street to a given number on an avenue positively elementary . But for the benefit of our less erudite readers , we have dug up a convenient system , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cross off the last figure of the given house-number , divide the remainder by two , and add the result to the number of the street at which the avenue begins . BROADWAY and Fifth Avenue , because of the eccentricities in their numbering system , have special numbers to add which bear no relation to the starting point of those splendid thoroughfares ; and you are warned that any number on Fifth Avenue below Seventeenth Street will have to be ascertained otherwise . With these few drawbacks , however , the method of all this is as certain as it is simple . AFTER crossing off the last figure / of the house-number , dividing by two and keeping the result firmly in mind , add it to the following numbers : for Avenues A , B , C , D , and First and Second Avenues , 3 ; for Third Avenue , 10 ; for Lexington Avenue , 22 ; for Fourth Avenue , 8 ; for Madison , 28 ; for Park , 34 ; for Sixth , 6 ; for Seventh , 12 ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenth , 14 ; for Eleventh , 15 ; for Columbus , 59 ; for Amsterdam Avenue , 59 . All of these are the numbers to be added and are those of the streets at which the various avenues have their beginning . For the rebellious Fifth Avenue , you will have to add 17 ; for Broadway , deduct 30 , and if the result on downtown numbers is less than zero , you are out of luck . Examples : If the given number is say , 328 Park Avenue ; cross off 8 , divide 32 by 2 ( getting 16 ) , add 35 , and you will find that the nearest cross-street is Fifty-first Street . Or if 831 Fifth Avenue is your destination , cross off 1 , find that one-half of 83 is 41% , add this result to 17 , and you know that you must look for your address between Fifty-eighth and Fifty-ninth Streets . Do n't say we are n't helpful . The Red Lights IF YOU have difficulty in finding a taxi these days , look up one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxi-driver there , his car parked along the curb , busily knocking out the red lights from the thousand and one lamps that adorn the modern taxicab . The police have issued a new ruling that red lights shall appear only on the rear of taxicabs . This cruel hardship , has been found necessary for public safety . As an ordinary taxi carries nine green , fourteen blue and two dozen red lights on each side of the car , the man driving from the opposite direction finds it difficult to get his bearings . From now on , only ambulances will be allowed red lights in front . Back Yard THE NEW Ziegfeld Theatre at the beginning of the rejuvenated Sixth Avenue at Fifty-fourth Street , " It looks to me , ma 'm , like this spot was made by alcohol .

" ? ? raises the question whether Broadway is going to contaminate that new residential district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Broadway has been responsible for the shabbiness of Sixth below that point , or whether the blame lies wholly on the Elevated . Nobody seems to know this , and nobody cares to prophesy what will spring up between Forty-second Street and Fifty-third Street when  --  and if  --  the Elevated goes . It 's an odd section . A big department-store district lies below it , an apartment-house district lies above it , the side streets running to Fifth Avenue include some of the most expensive streets in the world , and the Great White Way is within a stone 's throw on the other side ; yet this particular portion of Sixth Avenue is like nothing but West Fourteenth Street . It begins at Thirty-eighth Street , with a flock of cheap fur-shops and men 's furnishing stores . ( Forty-second Street , by the way , puts a curse on any avenue it touches . ) Thereafter , the eye is saluted with a vicious circle of tawdry hotels and shops .

Here are a few grocers and fishmen and a candy shop where , they tell you , Bernie Baruch bought candy as a tiny tot . AND THERE is the old car-barn , no longer used to house cars , but still in use by motormen and conductors . More checkers are played there , we believe , than anywhere else in New York City . And overhead the Elevated growls , as it has done ever since its ill-starred birth . The street seems curiously decadent. - But of late this cheesy part of Sixth has begun to grow restless . Property is constantly changing hands ; store leases are all two- to Eve-month affairs ; Bing and Bing are said to control the car barns and to have some plan in mind ; rents gradually rise .

Old English AGENTLEMAN connected with the Rockefeller Institute discloses that , among hundreds of letters of denunciation received by the institution during the past year was one from a man in Arkansas who took the view that all this modern education is dangerous and that the new-fangled practice of grounding preachers in Latin and Greek is especially pernicious . They ought to be taught English , and only English , he said , adding in conclusion , " If English was good enough for Jesus , it 's good enough for me. "
