THE BOOK WITHOUT A NAME-Anonymous - Brentano 's ( $2.50 ) . The lady of this 18th Century journal seems to have lived in a quiet way , in a Hall , by a forest , with her natural son , a few friends and a few gypsies for company . Some evenings she would draw close to her bedroom fire and reflect upon her unconventional estate , her mother love , the perfection of her absent lover , passing events in politics , art , literature , or upon life itself as she found it in her solitude . The texture of her mind was altogether extraordinary , far in advance of its time , indeed of this time too . Only a few pages are necessary to convince the reader that here is no hoax like The Diary of a Young Lady of Fashion in the Year 1764-65 , published last winter by a whimsical Irish girl . Nor is there room left for wonder that this lady 's descendants should have kept her journal in locked bureau drawers all these years . <P> The editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each entry with " a quotation therefrom . One of these quotations appears . twice , being the thought most prominent in the lady 's mind : " It is motherhood , not wifehood , that matters . " She was an early feminist , having determined upon motherhood and compacted " earnestly " with her lover , a Baron , who drowned returning from Paris in 1763 . " Let every woman be a mistress , " she wrote , and projected a book on this theme , setting forth the naturalness of parenthood , the superiority of " naturals , " the state 's duty and the end of bawdry through free love . <P> She was an antiChristian , finding <P> Marcus Antoninus " as good or better than Jesus . " She corresponded with Rousseau , whom she deemed to have known few fine women . She read Toland , Tindal , Hume , Locke , Grey , Campion , Herrick , Pope and Shakespeare , among others , never without intelligent commentary .

" <P> Her phrases were most original . To describe the fop of her day she invented or hit upon the significant epithet , " awless . " She called sky " an ancient scroll . " She knew what was meant when her gypsy crone said : " She will never be lonely while pushing sticks into fire and watching them burn away . " One evening she wrote : " The secrets of life that are discovered from age to age are as hard to find as a knife lost in rushes . " She sympathized with the American colonists and aroused by George Ill 's banishment of traitorous Jack Wilkes to ask : " Why is it that dogs are never hunted by weasels ? " <P> Most amazing was her attitude towards her boy , Robert , and through him , towards society . She marked his birthdays as day of special grace for her . She let him wander naked , and herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she felt , and many another sage , would have approved ; her contemporaries " would rather face their God with naked souls than naked bodies , " being disease-ridden , blotched and misshapen . She freed her boy from fear of the dark and the forest . She resolved , in one of the old fashioned phrases so fresh on her pen , to urge him out of the nest that he may learn to fly .
