Scoundrel <P> Sirs : <P> I have been a reader of TIME almost from the beginning and have always found that the few displeasing features were always balanced by the many pleasing ones . <P> However , I would have enjoyed TIME , June 28 , much more if there had been a different picture on the front cover , happen to be one of the millions who had to use " bullets " instead of " ballots " to put " Wilhelm Der Zweite " where he belongs . I was glad to use bullets , in 1918 to endeavor putting him off his throne and I wish I could have used a ballot in 1926 to deprive him of the riches and property which are not his by right and use them for the relief of the poor German people who need it . <P> I am on a bed of pain to this day , directly , or at least indirectly , because the man , whose conceited likeness you have on your front cover , made it necessary for all the world that believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course the article on p. 13 was news , and all right , but why cause Americans , or at least one , to remember any more vividly that arch-rascal and scoundrel " Wilhelm Der Zweite " who felt that he was almost if not equal with God ? <P> WILLIE E. HUNTER <P> Prosperity , S. C. <P> Incantatory <P> Sirs : <P> TIME is universal , international , historical , eternal . It is unprejudiced and unfearing . Your article on the ex-Kaiser TIME , June 28 , GERMANY was illuminating , incontatory , stimulating . <P> ROBERT L. GORDON Baltimore , Md . <P> " Impressions ' " <P> Sirs : <P> I have just returned from a European trip and was particularly interested in your article in the issue of May 3 , p. 14 , on King Haakon of Norway . As you will note from the clipping enclosed , I had the pleasure of conversing with the King about the time this article was written , and hence I am in a position to at least say that my impressions of the King were much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More power to you . . . . <P> P. S. STEENSTRUP Buick Motor Co . San Francisco , Calif . <P> Subscriber Steenstrup 's clipping reads in part : <P> " When the King , upon opening the conversation in Norwegian , was informed by Steenstrup that he had not conversed in Norwegian for thirty years , and that his Norwegian conversational ability was hardly fit for a King , the King smiled and continued his remarks in English . " - ED . <P> Unique Sirs : <P> ... As a newspaperman , I find TIME a valuable weekly review . It contains so many facts , so few errors . At first I felt that you overdid the feature angle , but I appreciate your unique style now . <P> H. P. HOWARD <P> The Associated Press , Pierre , S. D. <P> Horrible <P> Sirs : <P> You have a lot of good qualities and I shall subscribe to you again . In the meantime it will rest me to get away from your haste and really unnecessarily bad English . No one ought to be in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and unfailingly horrible literary style . <P> A. H. COOK <P> Narberth , Pa . <P> Mule <P> Sirs : <P> Missouri may raise the most mules but surely Alabama raises the funniest ones . As far back as I can remember I have been regaled with stories of this remarkable quadruped . And now , " honor to whom honor is due . " The enclosed clipping is self-explanatory .
