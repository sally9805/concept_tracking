In Chilton , England , the Rev. E. P. Gough , rector of a nearby parish , found a church , buried beneath a rubbish pile . Disregarding the symbolical nature of his discovery , he immediately broadcast news of it together with interesting details . The church had apparently been built in the days of Roman occupancy of Great Britain ; in it , it seemed probable , St. Augustine had initiated bearded and barbarous tribesmen into fellowship with a kind , mysterious and splendid God . During the lapse of savage centuries , the little church had become overlaid with dust ; when found , it was covered 14 feet deep with the refuse of many dreary years . <P> Like many corners of England , Chilton abounds with relics of its ancient tenancy . Near to the almost perfectly preserved little chapel which Rector Gough discovered last week are the remnants of a Norman Church , built at a much later date and destroyed during the last century . In its foundations there is a tomb upon which travelers may read this somewhat anxious epitaph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and gracious God have mercy . "
