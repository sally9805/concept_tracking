After ten years of beating , Congress last week transformed a monster sword into something faintly resembling a plowshare . It was the War Department 's $160,000,000 project on the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals , Ala. , a power dam to generate electricity to fix atmospheric nitrogen to make nitrates to make explosives to blow up the Enemy . <P> Nitrates can also be used to make fertilizer for farmers . Electric power never comes amiss . Hence the decade of debate , which was between men who thought the Government should keep and run Muscle Shoals to benefit farmers and men who thought the Government should sell or lease the project to a private operator . Among the bidders for Muscle Shoals have been Henry Ford , the American Cyanamid Co. , the Union Carbide Co. , Elon H. Hooker , the Underwood Power Co. , the Consolidated Power Co. , the Air Nitrates Corp. , the Muscle Shoals Fertilizer Co. , the Alabama Power Co . <P> What finally settled the debate was not the sweet reasonableness of Congressmen but the rapidity with which science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plies its trade was another contributing factor . <P> Science helped settle the Muscle Shoals question by making obsolescent that process of fertilizer manufacture which requires water power to make the nitrates . Nebraska 's Norris , who fought the farmers ' fight in the Senate , wound up by admitting that Muscle Shoals fertilizer would probably not be cheap enough . The measure he pressed and got passed last winter dealt chiefly with Muscle Shoals water power , leaving the Department of Agriculture to experiment with fertilizer as a byproduct . The Senate voted for Government operation when persuaded that a Power Lobby had gone to extreme lengths to oppose it . <P> In the House , the Norris measure was altered by Pennsylvania 's Morin to plump the U. S. squarely into the fertilizer business . This brought the National Fertilizer Association buzzing back to Washington in open , indignant lobby . Their case seemed better than the case of the Power lobbyists and the House consented to substitute the words " fixed nitrogen " for " fertilizer . " The U. S. would make , as it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the finished product . Government operation of the power plants was retained and , as the Bill passed the House , a $10,000,000 Government power corporation was set up . Any power left over after nitrate-making may be sold to the neighboring South at cost . Also , a new $25,000,000 dam was provided , 200 miles upstream from Muscle Shoals on Cove Creek in Tennessee . <P> The House sent the Bill to conference with good reason to think that the Senate would approve , the President sign .
