txt CHAPTER III ROUSE PLANS AND CONSTRUCTION A rn ( ( it all , the exterior of a house should be shaped and determined by its inner comfort and convenience . The Scotch phrase " far ben " speaks of that inner privacy , the hearth , which is the heart of the home , and around which everything else is grouped . Some one has said : " Begin with the chimney and fireplace and build the house around that . " Arrangement of rooms . ? In spite of the fact that we must allow for radiators , registers , and gas logs , there is opportunity for much choice in the arrangement of our rooms . ( ' ertain things may be said of both apartment and house . 11 ave as many separate rooms as the purse will allow . If there must be economy here , combine rooms in such a way that separate bedrooms may be retained . One may have a general living-room , instead of sitting-room and parlor ; the dining table may even be moved into the living-room or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of the dining-room . This applies only to crowded conditions , because we want our kitchen , dinin5 ? room , and sitting-room separate ; though , in the simple home where a woman does her own work some doubling up , as suggested , saves many weary steps . An important matter is the way that rooms open into each other . Each room should have an exit independent of every other room . Where rooms open into each other see that they can be cut off , when necessary , for warmth and privacy . Notice that the arrangement of doors and windows permits of draughts of air when they are desirable . 30 // Wall space. ? Many rooms that give an impression of cheerfulness actually have no places for furniture because they are so cut into by doors and windows , fireplaces or radiu , - tors . See that the bedroom has a place for bed and bureau , and that each room is so planned that there is space for the furniture appropriate to it . One house was found to have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining-room or kitchen . The kitchen . ? See that the kitchen is a comfortable room , not too hot in summer . It need not be large to be convenient and practical , but be sure that a draught may pull through it . Be careful to have the kitchen , supply closet , and dining-room in close relation to each other . Fancy yourself walking from one to the other , and see which arrangement gives the fewest steps . The bathroom . ? Notice that the location of the bathroom makes it easily accessible to all , and that it is light and well ventilated . Closets . ? Remember to count the closets and cupboards and see if every available space has been used for this purpose . There is little danger that you will find too many . Entry or hall . ? This is important to consider in the smaller house . We all like a wide , comfortable space as the front door opens to us . But in a large house a hall with broad and easy stairway , perhaps a fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramped or crowded entrance , but be sure that space is not used here that might give more real comfort in the living-room or the dining-room . Stairs . ? Notice these particularly . Is the tread comfortable ; are they safe and easy for older people and little children ; can trunks be easily carried up and down ? Look particularly at the back stairs , which are often awkward and dangerous . // Some other important points . ? Remember the servant 's room . See that it is habitable and planned for human comfort . In the apartment look particularly for the arrangement of rooms in regard to air-shaft and opposite apartments . Do not forget the placing of fire escapes . Be sure , too , in the large dwelling house , that there are fire escapes from the upper story . ( For ventilation and plumbing , see Chapters IV and V. ) In a house large enough , plan porches or balconies for sleeping out of doors , and also if practicable , a room that can be completely cut off in case of illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ell . CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE This is a technical subject in the field of architecture , and the details must be worked out by the architect and builder . Every householder needs to be informed in regard to certain basic facts , however . The foundation and cellar . ? Never take a house without looking at the cellar ; and when you are building , be willing to put enough money into it to make it good . A cellar must be dry , and the foundation strong enough to hold the upper structure firmly . Damp in the cellar penetrates the house , and a badly built foundation causes settling and cracking of the walls . This is true in an apartment house , where we usually ignore the cellar in selecting the apartment , trusting that all will be well . One family that had suffered a whole winter from various illnesses learned in the spring that a foot of water had been standing in the cellar . The foundation had been badly laid in the bed of a brook . In another apartment the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied a year , both defects due to a poor and badly laid foundation . Of course , good buildHOUSE // ing laws and honest inspection will in time do away with such conditions . In the meantime , watch the cellar . Have good workmen and do not hurry them . If the diggers of the cellar strike water , tiles must be laid to draw it off . The floor should not be perfectly level , but even and inclining gradually to some lower spot . This floor is made of a mixture of small broken stone , sand , and cement , at least two inches thick and well pounded . When this is hard , a layer of mixed Portland cement and sand two inches thick is laid over it and made smooth . Such a floor will be strong and water-tight . This Portland cement is the best material for making a cellar waterproof . It is inexpensive , and simple to use . The walls must be plumb , and it is well to have a coating of Portland cement placed on the outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even coating of the cement , one inch in thickness , added . This should reach below the level of the cellar floor . This same method can be applied to an old cellar , by digging the earth away outside , to the very bottom line of the foundation . This plan is recommended by a practical cellar builder , who has found this a permanent cure for many damp and leaky cellars . Double cellar walls are sometimes used , and are good , but they add greatly to the cost of the cellar . Materials for the upper structure . ? Stone , brick , and concrete are the usual materials for large buildings , and small houses in cities must be built of these materials when the fire laws require it . They are durable and fireproof , and not absorptive of damp if the bricks are well baked and the walls well laid . Wood has been the material of the average single house , on account of its cheapness . It is no longer cheap , if the quality is good , for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save our supply . More and more , brick and cement will be used in the small house . This will make for safety from fire ; although there is a charm about a well-designed wooden house that other materials do not give . The outer wall may be covered with clapboards protected by paint or cedar shingles . The latter soon weather to a pleasing color and will last many years . Stained shingles are also much used . Stucco , laid upon wood , is increasing in use . It gives warmth ; has a pleasing color ; and saves money , in that it is lasting , and does away with the expense of repainting . This may be used in the renovating of old houses instead of paint . The house walls . ? These must be double , with an air space between for warmth and dryness . In a wooden house some good sheathing should be used , of heavy paper made for the purpose . Hollow tiles give the necessary air space in brick and stone houses . The inner wall must be covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and must be thoroughly dry before the house is occupied . One thing that we should ask for in the inner wall and ceiling and floor is a curve when two surfaces meet at right angles ; round corners , as it were . This does away with one trap for dirt , and is used in well-built hospitals . The architect will tell you that this adds to the cost . The inner finish of the walls will be considered in the chapter on decoration . The floors . ? The floors should be made of well-seasoned wood carefully laid . They should be double , in order that sound may be deadened . Sometimes other materials are used to assist in the deadening of sound . For details in regard to the floors see the chapter on House Decoration . The roof . ? Here the material is all-important . The roof must be waterproof , durable , a protection against // undue heat in the rooms beneath , not too expensive , not too difficult to lay , and in harmony with the remainder of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler in summer if a layer of mineral wool can be placed directly beneath the roof . Tiling is beautiful on concrete and stucco houses , but it is very costly , and so heavy that the lower structure must be especially constructed to hold it . Slating is also expensive and cold in effect . Cedar shingles are durable , and one of the best of the ordinary roof coverings . There is a new method of applying shingles that gives the effect of the thatched roof seen on the English cottage . A felting is being used as an inexpensive roof cover . It is cemented at the seams , and fastened with flat nails . It does not absorb heat and can be painted if desired . This is a good covering for the roof dormer windows . Avoid tin . It draws heat , needs repair and painting often , is noisy when rain falls upon it , and it is ugly . Technical details . ? The details of wood , stone , and brick structure must be studied in some technical guide . Look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architect , and secure good workmen . Poor and cheap work are accountable for most defects in our houses . Rental . ? Rents vary so much in different towns and localities that no definite statement can be made beyond the fact that rent must never exceed one quarter of the whole income . If more than this is paid for rent , ends can not be made to meet except by undue sacrifice elsewhere . This is a fact stated by economists that works out in practice . Of course , if the rent is one fifth or one sixth of the income , so much the better . Within the allotted sum one must find the best available . // The cost of building must also vary with the locality , for the cost of material and labor is not the same everywhere . The following comparison shows how much the average cost has increased within a few years . It is the custom for a contracts to estimate the cost per cubic foot . When the size of the building is decided upon , the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is proved to be the average cost per ( . line foot , all labor and materials included . At present this is said to be $0.18 to $0.20 . Ten years ago it was $0.12 to $0.15 . A country carpenter in Connecticut in 1011 made a plan for a small house costing $1200 . There were three rooms and pantry downstairs and three small rooms upstairs . This estimate did not include plumbing . It is evident then that $2000 will build only a small house . From $2500 to $5000 must be available for average houses . This means that we need capital ; that we must save for some time ahead , borrow from a good Building and Loan Company , or buy on installments . The last is better than renting , provided the company selling the house is financially sound , the location good , and the house well built . No one should venture into such a scheme without con-sulting some good business man . CHAPTER IV HEATING , VENTILATING , AND LIGHTING HEATING and ventilating must be studied together , for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often shut out air , and must take great pains to see that this is supplied . General aim . ? We should aim to keep an even temperature in all parts of the house ( from 68 ? to 70 ? Fahrenheit ) , to supply extra moisture , to have an inlet for fresh and an outlet for foul air , and to save labor and fuel . Most of our heating systems are defective in one or all of these requirements , and to secure them in any degree of perfection means a large outlay . But something can be done in each case to improve the ordinary practice . Air if too dry is injurious to our breathing apparatus , Dur skin , and hair . In one schoolroom a test showed that the air was dryer than that of the Desert of Sahara . Yet this defect is one of the easiest to overcome . ( See each system . ) The fireplace and grate . ? These are unusual nowadays , used in summer in the camp or bungalow , in spring and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other systems in winter . The open fire is the poetry of heating ; nothing should ever supplant it . The heat is agreeable , but uneven . Ventilation is secured by the passage of air up the chimney , if the chimney is well built , but drafts from doors and windows are difficult to prevent . Both fireplace and grate are wasteful of fuel , as so much heat 37 // passes up the chimney . With coal grates a large shutter can be placed in the opening of the flue , to be used as a damper . Wood is a luxury to the city dweller and , as usually handled , an extravagance in the country . If the wood lot from which the supply comes is properly forested , wood is a useful fuel . . Every one who owns a wood lot should obtain pamphlets on the subject from tiro United States Department of Agriculture . The stove . ? The first stoves date back to Colonial days , and still bear the name of the inventor , Benjamin Franklin . The original Franklin stoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many stove firms , replicas of some Colonial pattern . They are in reality iron fireplaces or grates , standing out in the room , and radiating more heat into the room than the fireplace . They are used in country Louses , or wherever an open fire is wanted and no fireplace is built in . ( See Fig. 13 . ) The type of coal stove known as " self-feeding " is most conuuon . It is impossible to heat a house evenly with them , as it is seldom desirable to have one in each room . The room above can be warmed by placing a register over the stove , although bad air then passes upstairs ; or by an iron " drum " in the upper room over an opening in the ceiling . If the stove is not well made , coal gas leaks out into tire room . Moisture must always be supplied by some vessel standing on the stove top . This is important . Labor on this type of stove is now light as it can be made . The coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed below slowly , and the draft and shaker are so well arranged that if cared for at regular hours , the fire will last for a long time ; weeks even , as in a furnace . One great objection is the space taken in the room , and also the extreme ugliness of the patterns commonly on the market . Iron does not // lend itself to flower patterns and human faces . This is a place where good design is much needed . The wood stove is used only where fire wood is abundant . The heat is intense . The wood in the stove has to be replenished more often than coal , but the fire will keep over night if a large stick is put in late and the damper shut . The sheet-iron stoves adapted to wood cost less than coal stoves . The old-fashioned name for these stoves was " The Air Tight , " as contrasted with the open Franklin . A wood stove when made of soapstone gives a less intense and more lasting heat . // Oil and gas stoves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent . They have to be carefully watched on account of possible fire . They vitiate the air , and frequent airing of the room is necessary . Water in an open vessel should always be placed on them to evaporate and furnish moisture to the air in the room . The hot-air furnace . ? In some ways this is one of the best mel hods of heating the small dwelling house . Fresh , moist air is easily secured . The heating , however , is not even for the house as a whole . In extreme weather the roonis are oft en culd on the windy side . Fresh air is obtained by a window , opening into an air box and flue , built into the house and opening into a chamber in the furnace , where a pan of vvalet supplies moisture . This air box should have an outside opening above the level of the ground , in order to have hider air , : 111 ( 1 should be carefully screened . There must also Im a void rivanee to regulate the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the walls at the side of t he room rattier than in the floor . A register in the chimm y will give an outlet for bad air in those rooms adjoining chimneys . Excellent furnaces are made that save fuel and labor , with appliances that regulate the lire , tool the amount of heat given off in different kinds of weal her and at different times of day . Steam and hot-water apparatus . These are the most common methods in cities . People differ in their opinions as to the merits of the two . Steam is cheaper to install . Hotwater apparatus gives an even heat , and once started , maybe kept even for the season . Steam heat is controlled more quickly , but is more intense , and the heat is less even . With both these the secret of success is in having a large furnace with a moderate fire rather than a small furnace forced . // There are patent contrivances for regulating heat and supplying moisture , but these are not commonly found in inexpensive plants . So here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbreakable bowl or vessel standing on each radiator , secured by a wire if it does not stand firmly . A water receptacle made to hang on the back , containing a heavy piece of cloth like a lamp wick , may be purchased at steam apparatus supply shops . Radiators are apt to be ugly , and should be as much out of sight as possible . In the case of steam heat , if the radiator stands under a window see that it is protected by a piece of wood or metal standing out from the window sill ; otherwise there may be trouble due to cool air condensi . g the steam in the radiator . In expensive plants hot-water apparatus is sometimes hidden in wall and floor . Some schemes for ventilation . ? In an ideal plan , fresh air , with dust removed , warmed and moistened , passes into the room in such a way that no draft is felt , while had air is removed and carried out of doors . The air should usually come in at the top of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets should be distributed over a space ( say in small openings along the cornice and footboard ) , and not concentrated in a few large openings . For such a system pumps and fans and shafts and flues are needed , and the cost is very great ; so great that few such systems exist in private dwellings . What , then , can the average person do ? Windows and chimneys must be used . A register in the chimney , near the floor , is a good thing with any heating system . Windows may be made into ventilators by putting a board under the lower sash , thus letting in air between the sashes ; if this is felt too much , cheesecloth can be placed over the opening and a board placed at an angle to turn the current of ail // upward . Another plan is to lower the upper sash , and place cheesecloth across the opening . Whether air comes in or pulls out at a window depends upon the direction of the wind , and the position of the window in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied to see how drafts pull , and these arrangements made accordingly . A screen as large as a fly screen and covered with cheesecloth is an excellent thing to use in all mild winter weather , and may be easily moved from window to window . One thing we must write in large letters . DO NOT BE AFRAID OF WASTING HEAT . Some people are so economical of heat that they breathe foul air all winter , night and day . We should save fuel , but we must save human beings . Remember to air rooms frequently . This may not be necessary in the twenty-first century , but it is now with our imperfect ventilation . If there is a ventilating system with fans , close all inlets and outlets in the room while the windows are open ; else the whole system stops working . Airing is necessary to remove odors . Have windows open at night , in all weather . Delicate people must be protected from chill ; but they , more than others , need the steady supply of air during sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you breathe at night ? Lighting the house . ? The kind of light that we may have is often determined for us by the city supply , or that already wired or piped in the apartment or house . Sometimes we may choose , even in small towns and in the country . An electric trolley company often supplies light , and there are a number of methods for making a home supply of gas . Artificial light should be steady , never flickering , lighting the room as evenly as possible , soft and not glaring , the color not too white , or bluish , or greenish , but inclined to the yellow . The placing of lights is something about which // we are often too careless . For lighting the room well high lights seem necessary ; but then they need shading or softening , so that the light does not strike directly into the eyes . A better effect is obtained by side lights , moderately high , than by central lights suspended . All brilliant lights should be toned down by some soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house take time to see that the fixed lights in each room are conveniently placed for reading and sewing , and for toilet purposes . A reading or sewing light should La low , shaded to protect the eyes , and to allow the light to fall upon the book or work . It should fall from the left when possible . Candles . ? Candles are still used for decorative purposes or when a soft light is wanted and for warm summer nights . Their chief defects are their flickering , and the possibility of fire . Candlesticks are now made with small glass shades , others with hoods that protect from drafts . Metal and paper or silk shades are made to fasten on the candle itself ; but something attached to the candlestick is safer . Lamps . ? Nothing gives a softer and steadier light than a good kerosene lamp with a central draft and circular wick , or a lamp of the " student " type . They do not give a disagreeable odor , and are not dangerous if well cared for . A denatured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . It will not be used commonly until denatured alcohol is cheaper . One great advantage of the lamp is that it is movable , and may be placed where it is most needed at the time . Gaslight . ? The " batwing " flame is passing by , for mantle burners use no more gas , and give a more brilliant light . If you have the old-fashioned flame , see that it is even in shape . If it is not , something is wrong with the " tip . " This you can remove yourself and clean with fine // wire , or sharp edge . A new tip may be needed . This kind of flame needs a shade to protect it from the motion of the air . A mantle burner gives so vivid and white a light that a shade is required to soften it . See that the mantle is straight , and that it is not jarred . Have extra mantles on hand , and learn how to place them . Electricity . - Where electricity is used , we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about shading it . A foreigner once remarked that we have much eye trouble in America because our lights are too bright . Probably we have swung too far from the tallow dip and pine knot of pioneer days . I loulrt less , a bright electric light , unshaded , strikes the eye like a little flash of lightning . Many well-shaded and sometimes artistic lamps are on the market , and home-made shades will serve the purpose . We should be particularly careful of t he eyes of little children when elec tricity is the lighting medium . CHAPTER V THE WATER SUPPLY AND DISPOSAL OF WASTE Is it not strange that though we have almost conquered the air , we have not yet fully learned to control our water supply , and many people still trust to luck that the water they drink is unpolluted ? This is one cause of the yearly deaths from typhoid , and the injuring for life of many who live through the fever . And this is only one of the evils from impure water . What are our sources of supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we purify it if it becomes polluted ? Scientists can tell us what to do and how to do it . We need to study the water supply and disposal of waste together , since it is waste matter that pollutes water . Remember that clean drinking water is a matter of money . Every community can have it by paying for it . Sources . ? We may collect rain water in tanks . In Bermuda this is the only source of supply . Or we may use surface water from rivers or lakes . Or we may find a spring welling out from some hillside , corning from deep down in the earth , slowly filtered through leaves and soil . Or we may reach these hidden stores by digging wells . How to prevent contamination . ? Nature has her own ways of purifying water if we do not interfere . As water slowly passes downward through the soil it is cleansed , largely by filtration and partly by the aid of certain bacteria which oxidize the impurities . As the water flows along in a slow-moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impurities tend to 45 // settle . Air and sunlight also help to purify it . It is only when we let waste matter collect and seep through some stratum of soil into the well or spring , or when we pour it , untreated , into brook and river , that Nature can not work fast enough and then we pay the penalty . A most terrible epidemic of typhoid in Lawrence , Massachusetts , was traced to one case of " walking typhoid , " where an outhouse was built above a brook that ran into the river supply and contaminated the water of the whole city . So our watchward is : " ( : card t he sources from all uncleanness. " /twit welter is used when other supplies are lacking . It is caught , as it pours from the roof and pipes into a cistern . The pipes must be so arranged that after a dry spell the first falling water is turned away from the cistern , until all the dust has been washed from the roof , gutters , and pipes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This gives a clean , soft water , wit h a " flat " taste that many people do not like . A spring , to be safe , must Ie rebore all sources of pollution . Some town or state geologist should be able to tell you how the strata of earth lie , and what probability there is of danger . The spring should be dug out , cemented , screened , covered , and piped to the house . The best thing to be said : trou ( : c well is : I ) o not have one . If your property is large , and you know the lay of your land , and have all waste properly removed , a well is fairly safe . Or if you make an artesi:iu bore , going below bed rock , the water is free from organic impurities , but may be " hard " with lime or iron . In a village or small town the ordinary well is too unsafe to use . You may cement it , have the surface about it clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you may have trouble from careless though quite distant neighbors . Every village and small // town should work for a common and safe water supply . Some people cling to their wells with almost personal affection . The common supply is often brought from a distance at the expense of the taxpayer , but at a less cost in the end than the loss of human life or human vigor . The source , whether river or lake , must be freed from all filth by removing outhouses and refuse , and it must be made safe by constant guarding ; in large systems there must be a patrol . Picnic parties , campers , and bathers must be kept off . Filtration plants of proper size must be installed no matter at what cost . A filtration plant is a large bed of gravel and sand through which the supply slowly filters before it reaches the consumer . Our large cities are learning this , and are spending millions of dollars ; and some day our small towns will take like precautions . It is a mistake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If you use an unclean city supply , a filter on the faucet will strain out mud and large particles . Such a filter must frequently be unscrewed and boiled . If the public supply is reasonably good , faucet filters are of very doubtful value . If there is any.doubt of the quality of the supply , the proper precaution is to boil the drinking water for at least five minutes . This must always be done in case of an epidemic of typhoid , which might be due to the water . The boiling " deadens the taste " by depriving the water of air , but this may be restored by letting the water stand in a clear , cool place or by pouring from one clean vessel to another several times . Boiling is also good if there is much lime in the water , in the condition known as " temporary hardness . " Buying spring water is a doubtful remedy , unless you have knowledge of conditions at the source . Distilled water may be accepted as safe if the distiller uses good methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The ice supply .  --  Natural ice is unsafe , for freezing will not destroy harmful bacteria nor remove dirt . Artificial ice is better , if the manufacturer is honest and the factory clean . I n either case , do not put ice into the drinking water , but cool the water by putting it in bottles on the ice , or in a cooler with ice around it . " Too much trouble , " you say ? Illness is a greater trouble . 1 ) ISPOSAI . OF WASTE So irlrort ; int is this matter that the degree of perfection reached seems the measure of the real civilization of any community . NIost c ? it ies and small towns keep the " best " streets free of litter and filth ; but look at the back yards along our railways , the Vacant lots between apartments and houses , the river Ic:urla in manufacturing towns , the dump heaps where the I ( ) Wit is filling in and " making " land , and you will see that we have ncueli to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough in these drys for the housekeeper to see that her own premises are tidy . She must work in some way with the whole community to see t h at good methods are used in street sweeping , disposal of sewage , food waste , and all the rubbish that is I brown in 1 he scrap heap of the human family ? ashes , tin cans , old iron , old shoes , and paper . " Out of sight , out of nrind " leas been the easy motto of the past , meaning out of our own sight , but not our neighbor 's always . Fire , earth , and water are coworkers with us if we use them aright . The isolated house . ? On the farm , or small place of a few acres , we can take care of our own waste , without trouble to our neighbors . Food scraps are given to animals . Everything burnable , like paper and rags , can be disposed // of in the stove or by bonfire . A large , cylindrical basket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a safe distance from buildings , will hold this kind of refuse for several days , and it can then be burned in the basket , when the wind is not strong . Tin cans and unburnable material may be buried in a hole dug for the purpose , and kept covered . Such things should not be carted away and emptied by the roadside . Slops may be carried off in pails on a barrow , and poured on a different spot each day . An earth closet should be used , with pails that can be taken out and carried off , the contents to be burned . Wood ashes are used as a soil fertilizer ; coal ashes for filling in . If there is water piped into the house , waste is usually piped out . In this case the isolated house may have a cess pool , preferably constructed on the " septic tank " principle . It should be dug deep , and constructed so that it may be self-emptying . It should be cemented , and divided into two compartments . The waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquefied , passes out by a system of pipes and tiles into some open field where it is taken up by vegetation . The old-fashioned cesspool in the back yard is a constant menace . The village and city . Here there must be community work . The outhouse with a vault and the cesspool must be banished , and some system used for the whole . Sewage can be piped out into a field at a proper distance , and dis tributed over the surface much as in irrigation , the surplus water draining into some brook or river after it has been thus thoroughly filtered through the soil . This " sewage farm " method has been tried at the Experiment Station on the Merrimac River , Massachusetts , with success . The septic tank treatment followed by filtration through sand may also be used on a fairly large scale . Sewage should never be // poured unchanged into a river , on account of other towns below . If sewage is poured into salt water , the pipes should run far out and reach the deep tide current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For disposal of other kinds of waste on a large scale there are ample methods , if the taxpayers will only believe it is worth while to pay the bills . The city may partially pay expenses here by selling usable rubbish . Within the city house . ? Have proper cans to hold waste , and obey the city ordinances . In New York City , for instance , food scraps and paper should be kept separate . This is a rule made by the authorities , because paper and food scraps are finally disposed of by the city in different ways . Whatever the town rules may be , obey them . If you find they are inadequate , help to get them improved . Plumbing . ? This is one of the vital things in the house , upon which good health depends . The plumbing system brings in water and takes out waste , with water as the cleansing and carrying agent . The waste pipes must be of iron , tight at all joints , and large enough to carry off all material without clogging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steady flow . Noxious gases must not be allowed to collect and pass into rooms . Ventilating pipes , called vent pipes , are connected with the waste pipes so that gases pass upward and out above the roof . Water is used to prevent the gases from rising into the room , and is called a water seal . The water is held in a bend in the pipe called a trap . 1 . The trap . ? Figure 14 shows a cross section of a trap , called the S trap on account of its shape . This is still considered the best form of trap , although there are others on the market . Notice that it is a perfect trap for holding the water ; but when a basin is emptying , it allows a rapid // passage , and so it does not hold solid particles such as hair and lint . Notice that there is an opening at the lowest part of the S to be unscrewed with a monkey wrench for cleansing the trap once in a while . There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when the traps are well flushed daily . Each basin , sink , tub , and closet must have its own trap . If two basins are connected with one trap , the water may sometimes pull out or " siphon " from the trap . Sewerage system . ? Figure 15 illustrates the main parts of a house system .

Plumbing attachments . ? These in-elude basins , sinks , bathtubs , laundry tubs , water closets , with the smaller metal attach-ments belonging to each .

Figure 17 gives a cross section of a basin . Notice that there is no chain for the stopper . The " waste rod " ( 1 ) acts directly on the stopper . The stopper ( 2 ) in basin is operated by turning the handle ( 3 ) . This particular device is said to be simpler in construction than any other of this type . // If the faucet is one that turns on and runs steadily , an overflow is needed . This overflow is not easy to keep clean . // It is better to have the type of faucet that needs a steady pressure to keep up the flow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The construction is such that the vent is above the top edge of the closet , so that any overflow taking place from stoppage in the closet is not forced into the vent pipe , and each time the closet is operated the vent chamber ( 4 ) is flushed , as well as the bowl . This closet is also more noiseless than many . Care of plumbing . - All basins must be cleansed daily with hot and cold water . Once a week wash out the traps with a solution of caustic soda . If leaks in pipes are sus pected , pour peppermint oil in the vent pipe of the roof . If the odor is detected anywhere in the house , send for the plumber . CHAPTER VI DECORATION OF THE HOME FEw people realize the effect that a well-decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . It produces an environment of harmony , of beauty of form , line , and color ; and the general atmosphere resulting from this harmony is conducive to better living . In the past this work has been put largely into the hands of the experienced decorator or left to the haphazard working out of those who did not know or who were guided by intuition rather than principles . The girl of to-day and to-morrow should have a fund of information along these lines that will aid her in surrounding herself and her family with the colors and forms that tend to promote an atmosphere of restfulness in daily living . Many people who have not technical artistic skill can make home attractive , and this is as much an expression of the artistic temperament as the ability to paint a beautiful picture or to model a statue . It is very important , for it is helping to make life more beautiful through the adaptation of art to everyday things . The desire to decorate , to beautify , is inherent in the race , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tools , and dress . In successful home furnishing , the aesthetic aspects together with economy and hygiene should be borne in mind . Too many homes are furnished simply for show without relation to health or pocketbook . Beauty in house decoration depends upon the harmonious 55 // relation of parts and of each part to the whole . The aim should be to make it as simple as possible , and appropriate , in that it is adapted to one 's mode of living . William Morris said , " To give people pleasure in the things they must perforce use ; that is the one great office of decoration . " The home should be refined and inviting ? a place that it is a pleasure to enter ? where cheer and comfort greet us and the atmosphere is one of rest . Much of this general atmosphere can be produced through the right kind of house decoration . Bright colors and showy effects with exciting combinations do not tend to produce an atmosphere of repose . The interior should be simple and an honest expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home will find it wise to select articles with thought toward appropriateness and serviceability . This requires a definite plan before purchase is made , for it means a consideration of the whole life of the home , spiritual as well as material . The problem of those who are already established in homes is more difficult , for this often necessitates the utilization of present belongings in the attempt to produce harmony . Sometimes this will call for the disposal of much that is ugly , though valuable . The articles about the home should express the individuality of its members and should be honest , simple , and true . Is the furnishing of use ? Does it please in color , form , and decoration ? Is it durable ? All these questions help one to decide whether the furnishings are to be discarded or whether they shall remain a part of the daily life . It is not good taste to accumulate a quantity of useless articles in the home , but rather to select a few things that will add to the comfort and well-being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Decorate construction , do not construct decoration . " // Unity . ? The first guiding principle then in the selection of decorations and furnishings for a home is the thought of unity . Some definite scheme should be adopted in planning the whole apartment or house . This idea should be kept always in mind when the decorations and furnishings are selected . In those things that nature clothes , there is unity ? a freedom from disturbing and unrelated elements . This unity we find is due to proper relationship of shapes , lines , dark and light , and color . With this idea in mind one would never decorate in bright red a room opening into one of lavender treatment , or place a set of dark stuffed furniture in a country home where only wicker and chintz or light fur nishing would be appropriate . No object should intrude itself , and one should be conscious at first only of a delightful whole . Decoration is for the purpose of producing this harmony , it is not simply for ornament . Simplicity in house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will prefer the things that are appropriate and which meet the needs of comfort and daily living . Sim plicity of taste means that conglomerate mixtures of all kinds of materials and furnishings will not be tolerated . One picture of good print and simple framing will be prefer-able to several bright chromos or large family portraits in gilt moldings ; one simple vase with a beautiful spray of apple blossoms has more beauty than an exhibition of brie a-brac such as many homes exhibit . Use as well as beauty if kept in mind will guide . Appropriateness . ? In planning avoid the selection of unusual or pretentious furnishings or decoration . The fur nishings should represent the ideals and the standards of living of the family , should be within the income , and should be appropriate to the station in life . A Louis XV drawing-room would not be an honest representation of a college // professor 's life , even if he could afford such furnishings . Ideals as well as ideas influence selection . Simple wicker furniture and muslin curtains , if one can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin draperies and upholstered chairs . The principle of appropriateness must be borne in mind in the furnishing of each room . Uncomfortable chairs do not suggest the ease and restfulness of a living room or heavy draperies and thick carpets the healthful or inviting bedroom . The use of articles often determines their appropriateness . " Dust collectors " are seldom useful or appropriate , and much time is consumed in dusting useless bric-a-brac , furniture with much carving , twisting , and ornamentation that is neither beautiful nor suitable . One would not expect to find upholstered chairs or velvet carpet in a kitchen , and neither should one find inappropriate furnishings discarded from other places in the bedrooms or living room . Decoration must take into consideration also the principles of good line , dark and light , shape and color . These principles will be shown in their application to dress ( Chapter XIX ) and are as truly applicable to questions of decoration and furnishing of the home . Good " lines . " ? The home selected may not have good form or " lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , it is possible to keep the proportions in proper balance . If this is carefully worked out , homes so constructed will not need as much decoration , for the pleasing " lines " and proportions are decoration in themselves . Houses , like people , must be so decorated by dress as to bring about the most harmonious effect , and to correct the poor lines of inartistic construction . Some suggestions will be given under wall coverings for changing the effect of fixed lines . There should be no jerky angles , but a rhythmic flow of lines one // within and into another . The proper arrangement brings about design and space relationship , which must be carefully considered in choosing wall coverings , draperies , rugs , and other furnishings . Color ) . ? Many women fail in their schemes for home decoration because of a lack of real appreciation of color . This is due to the fact that the color sense needs training , which is sometimes difficult to attain . Appreciation is often inherent and a part of one 's being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which come in life to some , and from which others are debarred . Every girl in her high-school art classes will have opportunity to study color . To think about color in daily living is a good way to study it . Notice what nature teaches . Observe the sunsets on a clear day , then on a misty one when all is rather gray . Notice the wonderful backgrounds of middle values of gray and purple , brown and green . See how the bright colors are placed in little patches by way of relief and determine the relation of these color combinations to the problems of dress and home decoration . ( See color suggestions under dress , Chapter XIX . ) Color schemes in relation to light must be carefully con sidered . This will be explained under selection of wall coverings . Gradation of color is a part of every correct scheme in home decoration . The dark values and less in-tense colors should always be at the base , consequently ceilings are light in value and walls of intermediate value and intensity . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast . Contrasting colors or comple mentary colors should be used carefully , as this arrangement of decoration tends to make both colors stand out . Suc60 SHELTER AND CLOTHING cessful combinations provide for the use of a large amount of one color and a small amount of the contrasting color , which is always in subordinate relation . In planning color schemes , those having one predominant color will be found very pleasing for simple interiors . With these general principles in relation to furnishing and decoration one can begin to consider in more detail the problems of decoration . After the house is selected , the first problems in decoration relate to floors , woodwork , walls , and ceilings . These should really be considered together as well as in the relationship of one room to another . It is desirable to have an effect of unity and harmony . For convenience in study , the walls will be discussed first . The wall decorations . ? Before choosing the particular decoration for any wall , there are several problems which confront the home maker and which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , its size , shape , exposure , use , ? all affect selection if a harmonious whole is to be the result . In considering the walls , questions of sanitation and protection are as important as decoration . The painted wall is most sanitary , for it can be cleansed with soap and water and permits of some decoration in the way of stenciled borders , etc . Wall papers sometimes decay and become infected with germs . They therefore are not as sanitary as painted walls . This makes paint especially preferable to paper in the case of the bedroom , as well as the kitchen , pantry , and bathroom . Walls are often covered with burlap , canvas , Japanese matting , muslin , or rough plaster , and for decoration these are sometimes painted . Paper is the most common wall covering , and many beautiful effects can be obtained with it . Its use is more general because it is as a rule cheaper . Care should be taken to // keep it clean , and it should be changed after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of light is one of primary importance and the location of each room should be carefully studied . Light enters usually from the sides only , and we have not only direct but reflected light from all the wall and ceiling surfaces . This should be consid ered in decoration when the question of too little light necessitates a light wall covering , or too much one of darker value to absorb the brightness and light . Colors of strong chroma and dark value absorb a great deal of light . When there are few windows and the interior is gloomy , a bright wall covering of cream , yellow , pale green , or other bright color value with white woodwork will produce a light effect because of the reflection as well as the decoration itself . The question of the particular hue , value , and chroma of color to be used will depend on the amount of light ad mitted to the room by day as well as its lighting at night . On the north side of the house one should have some warm color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Yellow in various values , or other warm colors , such as the so-called reds , terra cotta , tan , golden brown , buff , etc. , should be used where north light predominates . When rooms are located with a southerly exposure and there is plenty of sunlight , the cool colors are most effective ? the light values of green , ' blue , lavender , tan . Bright yellow or reds are not needed in a sunny room , neither are cold greens or blues comfortable in one of northerly exposure . The color of the woodwork and floor also affects the pre-dominant color of wall surface . If the woodwork is painted , it can be changed more easily to harmonize with the wall // color than can the varnished or stained woodwork of modern houses . This harmony of color with woodwork as well as the daylight and sunlight of a room should be carefully weighed in choosing color . If furnishings have been bought , they too should be kept in mind in the selection of color of wall covering for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its exposure should affect choice of wall decoration . Bedroom walls should be covered simply and quietly . Such rooms are primarily for rest . The kitchen walls as well as the bathrooms and pantries are best painted green , tan , or buff , a warm or cool hue according to location and amount of light . The living room wails should he treated with something which will be unobtrusive in color and design , as it is the room where the family collects usually for rest at the end of the day . The dining room should offer cheer , and certain values of tans , blues , and reds , according to the amount of light , are always pleasing . The size and shape of the rooms are also of primary importance . If the rooms and halls are small and open one into another , an effect of unity is produced by deciding on one rather light color for all . This effect produces a feeling of spaciousness , for light colors make small rooms look large as dark ones tend to make large rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will emphasize the height . Borders should be omitted in rooms with low ceiling , as they break the line between wall and ceiling and detract from the height . If the ceilings are high , the effect of the height may be broken by carrying the color of ceiling down on the side walls or using a border with the picture molding below . This horizontal effect detracts from the height . The walls should be considered as a background for the pictures , furnishings , and life of the home , and must be so // harmonious that they will tend to unite the whole , and yet remain the background and confining outer limit . Color in wall covering is , therefore , very important in its effect on the atmosphere of the home . Red is known to be very exciting and to tax the nervous energy of the occupants ; while strong blues and cold colors , especially in sunless rooms , may have a depressing effect . Yellow values add to the sunniness and cheer ; and browns , tans , and grays have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its many combinations and possibilities . The soft colors , that is , those of low chromes and middle value , are the most pleasing , for they make good backgrounds which harmonize well with the woods of furniture , floors , and woodwork , and thus unite the whole . Plain papers make the best background for pictures , as they throw in relief the subjects of interest . Plain papers are more restful than figures , and one does not grow so tired of them . They are more apt to show spots or soil and , especially in a hallway , though they are pleasing , they are not durable . Cartridge papers of good soft colors make effective backgrounds , as do burlap , linen , and matting in plain color . These may be relieved by a decorative band or border near the ceiling , the width of which will depend on the height of the room . Borders may be stenciled on plain paper , or designs cut from figured paper may be arranged to form a border and give a finished appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paints which are produced in good shades . They can be used on rough or smooth plaster , burlap , muslin , or any surface used for walls . Oil paint , though more expensive , is always sanitary and pleasing , especially in the dull finish . Figured papers are preferred by many , but great care is necessary in selection in order to obtain harmonious 65 // effects . The use , exposure , and furnishing of the room should all influence choice ( see Fig. 19 ) . Striped papers are good in many places ( see Fig. 20 ) . They accentuate the height of a room and are dignified . There should not be great contrast in color between the stripes , for this tends to emphasis , and the pronounced dark lines will stand out in an unpleasant way . The width of the stripe should depend on the size of the room . Broad stripes would be out of proportion in a small room , as they would tend to lower and narrow the effect . There are many excellent patterns in wall paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Be sure that the principles in relation to pattern are considered , for the shops show many that are ugly and distressing . The plain patterns are usually the best . Allover patterns , in which the figures connect , are more pleasing than those in which spots of repetition stand out in relief ( see Fig. 21 ) . Figures of allover patterns in two or three values of the same hues are more agreeable than those of contrasting hues . There are many ugly scroll patterns on the market . Beware of these . They are particularly bad when carried out in contrasts of color so that one feels bewildered by them on entering a room . The wall as a flat surface should not be covered with bouquets or flowers which appear waiting to be picked ( see Fig. 22 ) . The designs should be flat , and good decoration will represent the floral or fruit designs conventionalized and adapted to the flat surface . Avoid glaring contrasts of color and design . Large figures are suitable only for large rooms . Borders and friezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of a room will permit , and should not be used at all unless the border matching the paper is good in design . The walls of some rooms may be of proper // height to permit of a combination of figured and plain covering . This combination is very effective , and is usually so arranged that the lower or of the space is plain , with the figured paper above . This gives the appearance of a wide border and in a large room is very effective . Ceiling effects should be unobtrusive . The lightest values of color scheme should be used there , for it must be remembered that the ceiling acts also as a reflector of light . Scroll effects and gay color are not suitable , but light creams , grays , and tans which harmonize with the walls are always good taste . Picture moldings should be carefully placed , for they form . a horizontal line around the room and may break the space in wrong proportions . They are usually placed at the top of the wall covering close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carried downward to make a high room look low , the molding is put below it , and about on a level with the tops of the doors or window ' , . Avoid overelaborate , highly colored moldings . The simple ones of natural wood or color harmonizing with the walls are always the best . Floors . ? The floors of each room should ' e considered in relation to use , furnishings , woodwork , and wall decorations . These should all harmonize . The floor is the foundation and a background for decoration , and much of the final harmony will depend on its treatment in color . It is certainly more hygienic and it requires less work to have bare floors with rugs . Rugs may be cleansed more easily than carpets and the wood may easily be kept free from dust . If the floors are old and the boards not too rough and uneven , it is possible to fill the cracks and holes with a good filler and then paint and varnish or stain and varnish them . The question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on the cost , use of room , etc. , whether the floor is to be waxed , painted , or varnished . Light values of brown are usually good , and harmonize with furnishings and at the same time do not show the dust . The durability of floor finish should be carefully considered , for much labor may be saved by selecting the proper kind . The manufacturers of paints and finishing varnish have many varieties for all kinds of woods and all conditions of floors . Careful consideration of conditions is necessary in selecting the finish . Some of these bring out the natural beauty of the wood if the floor is a new one . If it is impossible to have hard wood , good yellow pine makes an excellent floor . Hardwood floors are the most beautiful and quite hygienic . These can sometimes be laid over old floors if the surfaces have been planed . Oak and maple are perhaps the most satisfactory . These can be left the natural color except for the filler and wax or other finish , or can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too light , as it is in some natural finishes , the lack of harmony with the walls and woodwork may destroy the color scheme . Rugs of carefully selected color may then be used to bring about the right balance . The finish is important . Good wax gives a beautiful smooth surface and lasts a long time . Hardwood floors are expensive in the beginning because of the filling , staining , varnishing , and waxing , but are so durable that they may be kept in order for a long time with very little extra expense , while carpets must be often removed and changed to be hygienic . Waxed floors may be well preserved by treating occasionally with a new coat of wax . This must be well rubbed in , which makes the cost greater than some other finishes . Kitchen floors are often a problem . There are many floor // coverings on the market of inlaid rubber , cork , and other materials . Some of these are very satisfactory , many are expensive . The inlaid linoleums can be bought in good colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often used for kitchen floors . Maple is very dense and a treatment with oil will tend to prevent the wood from absorbing grease . Linoleum or soft wood painted and varnished makes a good bathroom floor when it is not possible to have hard wood . Color is again important in order to have an unobtrusive background . The linoleum is easily cared for and can be laid over any kind of a floor provided the boards are even . An uneven warped floor will cause the linoleum to wear . Good linoleum costs $1 or more per yard . Floors for any part of the house where scrubbing is not necessary can be filled , stained , varnished , and waxed , or in place of varnish , shellac can be used . Woodwork . ? Woodwork can be painted , stained , or finished with varnish or wax . Color as well as durability must be kept in mind . White , gray , or cream is excellent when these colors harmonize with color schemes . In Colonial decoration white woodwork in harmony with mahogany rails is characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax or varnish requires much labor . This , however , pays , for it is most durable . It must be rubbed thoroughly in order to get a satiny , glossy finish . Varnish when left shiny is most inartistic and cheap looking . The woods are usually finished to show the grain . They are filled , sometimes stained , and finally finished with wax or varnish . If stained , the color of walls , floors , and furnishings should be considered , and the stain should not be obtrusive in color . Sometimes soft wood is painted to represent the grain of // hard wood . This is not good taste , for it is not honest . Such a finish is called " graining , " and painted surfaces are made to imitate oak , or the grain of other wood surfaces . A plain painted surface of suitable color is preferable to this . It is not necessary to have hardwood trim in order to get pleasing ( fleets . Yellow pine and some of the cheaper woods , when stained in gray or brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most artistic results . A little experimenting is worth while . After the walls , floors , and woodwork of the house have been carefully considered iii relation to color schemes , finish , etc. , it remains to place one 's belongings or to select new articles . Successful furnishing of the rooms depends on the harmony he ! veen the articles of furnishing ; this may exist in most humble interiors and depends upon careful selection and orderly arrangement . Floor coverings . ? A great variety of floor coverings is on the market from which choice can be made . Carpets of various kinds have been used as floor coverings for many years . At best , they are not hygienic unless often removed and cleansed , which is seldom practicable . In most old houses floors were finished rather roughly , and carpets were used for warmth as well as beauty . When it is necessary to use carpets , they should be carefully chosen in reference to the size of the room and the color values of the walls and woodwork . A plain color is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not too pronounced in color or design . Greens and browns are usually good . A carpet with large scroll pattern or bunches of Easter lilies is not good taste because obtrusive . It is not a good background for the rest of the furnishings . The carpet should be restful , the size of the design depending on the size of the room , and the colors not too many in number , preferably two values // of one hue . It is wise to have the floor colors of darker value than the walls and woodwork , but in harmony with their value and intensity . This color harmony should also be kept in mind in selection of matting or rugs as back-ground for furnishing . Carpets of Body Brussels , Wilton , velvet , and ingrain are the most popular ? when carpet is to be used . Japanese matting and other fibers are inexpensive if the floor is to be entirely covered . In selecting these good color and unob-trusive designs are best , and can be used with a few rugs to relieve the monotony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a room . Do not forget that a good-sized rug makes a room look larger than several small ones . There are many varieties of rugs on the market from the beautiful durable Oriental to the rag rug woven at the farm home or by local weavers . The Oriental rugs are beautiful in texture and coloring and are choice possessions . These rugs were first used by the tent-dwelling peoples for wall as well as floor coverings , and were things of sentiment as well as beauty : wedding rugs , dowry rugs , prayer , throne , and grave rugs ? all woven in symbolic designs with wonderful colors of wools and silks of beautiful texture . Much of the wool for modern Oriental rugs is still spun by hand , and the rugs are woven with much patience and diligence , as each little knot is tied to make the pile of the rug . They are really mosaics in wool . Rugs from the East are imported from many districts and have many names , Turkish , Cau-casian , Persian , Turcoman , Indian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who understands their value , or the purchase should be made from a reliable house . The value depends upon many things : the number of knots to the square inch and the length of the ends , the beauty of design and color , the quality of the materials used , // the dye , and the manner and care with which the weaving is done . A study of the various kinds with their character istic designs is most interesting . There is great variety in American rugs ; those of Body Brussels and Wilton are the most serviceable and are sold in good colors and patterns . The " Smyrna " rugs are soft and reversible , and there are other good wool rugs , many of which have patterns in two values of one hue , as border design or good simple figures . The old-fashioned braided rug and the rag rug are useful for certain kinds of furnishings . The old-fashioned patterns of " hit and miss " are sometimes distracting , because of the way in which the white is introduced , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light , and dark have been kept in mind , they are quite pleasing . CHAPTER VII FURNISHING OF THE HOME Furniture . ? There is perhaps no more delightful task in home making than the selection of furniture for the new home . A few fortunate people are the happy possessors of heirlooms of beautiful Colonial mahogany ( see Figs. 23 , 24 ) . There is always a place for these in a scheme of house decoration because of their beautiful simplicity of line , decoration , and finish . They should be treasured and preserved . Those that have been disfigured by generations of poor varnish may be restored . The majority of young people , however , in furnishing their new homes need some guiding principles which will help them to select modern furniture wisely . It must never be forgotten that furnishings express the taste of the individual making the home . They are a part of the individual and show his ideals for life and standards of taste and beauty . The ethical influence of well-made and well-designed furniture is difficult to estimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really successful home . It should yield utility and comfort , and furniture , in order to be beautiful , should be simple and strong in construction , with good lines . It should also be appropriate . With such principles in mind there will be fewer gilt chairs selected , ornate and insufficient in strength to hold an average person . It is better to furnish slowly and to choose one good piece at a time than to buy whole " sets " with superfluous pieces . Most people have too many pieces of furniture in 73 // each room ; a few of real purpose and well placed are more pleasing . A wise rule is to choose only those pieces that meet the needs of the users . This necessitates a careful study of old furniture as well as the new styles and productions of the leading manufacturers . It is better to buy one durable piece with good lines than three that will soon go to pieces and be of no service . Real antiques are very expensive , but there are to-day excellent reproductions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the Colonial assures us that the style will be a permanent one . We have really no new shapes , but the copies of the old English and Colonial times are so well reproduced , especially those of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , that a brief study of those periods should help one to choose intelligently . Our cabinetmakers to-day owe much to the designs and models that originated in England and were copied by the furniture makers of New England . The influence of four firms of English cabinetmakers is strongly felt in the repro ductions of to-day . They were in reality artists : Thomas Chippendale , A. Heppelwhite and Company , Thomas // Sheraton , James and Robert Adams . These were all eighteenth-century designers . The Adams furniture was formal , ornate , and costly . The Chippendale showed traces of Dutch and Chinese influence , and the ornamentation of French style ( see Fig. 25a ) . It was characterized by fine proportions , rather elaborate carving , and the bow form at the top of the back of chairs . The claw-and-ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful lines , and is lighter than the heavy Dutch styles which had previously influenced English furniture making . Carving and inlay were used in the backs of chairs as well as designs of paint or Japanned work . The backs of the chairs were oval , heart , or shield shaped ( see Fig. 26a ) . Sheraton styles were somewhat similar to Heppelwhite , but the chairs were characterized by more rectangular-shaped backs ( see Fig. 25 ) . Other styles were of such periods as Louis XIV and XV , Spain under Moorish influence , Holland of the sixteenth cenFURNISHING // fury , and England under William and Mary as well as the Georges . In the furnishing of the American home of to-day the styles of the early Italian and French are disappearing and the reproductions are rather of the more informal types from the time of William and Mary to the end of the seventeenth century . The comfort and the beautiful lines of these styles are better adapted to our mode of living than the elaborate Italian and French designs . " Mission " furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It lacks grace , and is often extremely clumsy , but is honest and simple . It is made of oak and will last for genera tions . It is comfortable as well as durable and has a place in modern furnishing ( see Figs. 27 , 28 , 29 ) . " Cottage " furniture is well adapted to use in summer homes or where it is necessary to furnish at moderate ex pense . It is in good style , simply finished , and durable ? a 78 // great improvement on the cheap , painted , beflowered cottage furniture of the past . It is dignified , easily cared for , and less expensive than the Craftsman ( see Figs. 30 , 31 ) . Willow furniture is very attractive , and has its place in modern schemes of furnishing . It is comfortable and artistic in appearance , and much of it is durable and inexpensive . It can be used a long time in the natural color and then stained or enameled . In selecting this style the workmanship should be carefully examined for weak places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or without cushions , and is most serviceable . Very often for expensive interiors upholstering of elaborate velvets and other textiles is used for willow furniture ( see Figs. 32 and 33 ) . // Bent-wood furniture , serviceable and simple in construction , is offered in the shops in variety of design in combination with cane or without . It finds its place in decoration of simple rooms , especially bedrooms . The woods used principally in the making of Colonial furniture were mahogany , rosewood , walnut , cherry , and birch . In some furniture we find , instead of the solid mahogany , some soft wood or occasionally mahogany backing veneered with a layer of mahogany . This was not sham , but utility , for by cutting the veneer to run in opposite direction to the Un-derwood , the maker provided against the tendency of the wood to shrink in one direction . The period of wal-a // nut furniture in America was a poor one . The wood was subjected to so many groovings , and the furniture ornamented with so many poor designs stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beautiful or is of use to-day . It was made during a period of debased design in all art . Draperies and curtains . ? The heavy dust-catching draperies , long curtains , and hangings used in many houses in the past seem to be giving way to simpler forms , and in many American homes to-day a more rational system of decoration with curtains and draperies is being followed . The sill-length curtains and overhangings and the lighter draperies are better adapted to the modest home . The draperies add to or detract from the artistic whole . As a rule the portiere should be of the same " value " as the walls . Plain walls can be relieved by figured portieres , and figured walls are made more interesting with plain hangings . The principle to bear in mind in choosing should be simplicity , suitability , and harmony with the other furnishings and decorations . Select hangings in keeping also with the purpose of the room . A velvet hanging is not appropriate in a bedroom . If plain textures are desirable , there are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , denims , arras , and other material . Velvets of many kinds make a rich , plain finishing , and many of the beautiful designs of old textiles from the palaces , churches , and museums of Europe are being reproduced . These fabrics with brocade and pile surface are interesting in dignified rooms where the effect desired is to produce the high lights and contrasting deep shadows . Figured fabrics are many , from the old-fashioned English chintzes , cretonnes , and block-printed linens to the more expensive silk brocades and wool tapestries . Portieres hung straight to escape the floor are the present // style , and are more dignified than many overhanging arrangements . By lining it is possible to use only one set in a doorway and have the lining harmonize with the room it faces . Good taste in hanging implies that they serve their purpose for decoration and use , and this in a harmonious way with thought of good lines , color , and design . Curtains are used for decorative purpose at windows to soften the lines of the wood casings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent those outside from looking into a room or to shut out unpleasant sights . Windows are for ventilation and light , and for the purpose of giving an opportunity to those wishing to look beyond the confines of the narrow room ; curtains should not interfere with these aims . Rooms would be prisons otherwise . Curtaining should not obstruct the view unless it is an unsightly one , and they should not obscure it except for the purpose of privacy . Long , clumsy lace curtains are seldom used to-day , but have been replaced by curtains made of many lovely materials from the inexpensive madras , scrim , cheesecloth , lawn , swiss , and linen to the more expensive curtains of brussels net and linen with inserts of filet and cluny lace . Costliness does not always mean that the best has been chosen , but in selection the material should be appropriate , sensible , and harmonious , and many inexpensive honest materials of swiss and cretonne , when used skillfully and in harmony with surroundings , are more beautiful and artistic than imitation velvets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning . Plain curtains of pongee , scrim , or simple muslin look well in some rooms when decorated with simple stenciled designs . There are many simple ways of hanging curtains . Curtains suspended from a brass rod in the straight-line effect , // with or without a valance , are very pleasing . They may be caught back simply , to admit light and air . For bathrooms , or other rooms where sash curtains are desirable , they may be fastened to the window frame to prevent them from blowing out , or they may be placed on a rod at the proper height from the sill . Pictures , bric-a-brac , and small furnishings . ? Again in selection one is confronted by the question of use and reason for being . Pictures and bric-a-brac are not of use except as they exert a silent influence . Pictures , casts , ornaments used to beautify should do this . With so many splendid reproductions from famous artists available , in sepia prints , // etchings , and photographs , there is no excuse for filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well chosen , are preferable to many . The Japanese place but one work of art at a time . In American homes we usually have too many pictures . If one is so burdened , it is possible to put some aside and change the subjects from time to time . Pictures of personal interest , as photographs of friends and personal favorites of reproduction , should be placed in the bedroom . In the hallways and general rooms subjects likely to be of interest to others are suggested . There is a wonderful fund from which to make selection : reproductions from Millet , Corot , Whistler , Abbey , Sargent , and hundreds of others having artistic value , as well as photographs of exquisite bits of scenery and dignified old ruins . Family portraits , when really artistic , have a place in the living room . The framing of pictures is important ; mats should be carefully chosen ; white ones are , as a rule , too conspicuous in places where the furnishing is in brown or green or dark values . Soft browns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be neat , simple , durable , and inconspicuous . A frame should not be noticeable , but it should bring out the attractiveness of the picture . Gilt frames are reserved generally for oil paintings . The hanging of pictures requires thought . Avoid having too many pictures on the walls ; they collect dust , and the effect is not artistic . The cord or wire should be as simple and inconspicuous as possible . Vertical wires with two hooks are preferable to slanting lines where but one hook is used . The size and shape of the picture should be considered in relation to the wall space , and an orderly , dignified arrangement made . Many pictures are hung too high . A diagonal effect in placing pictures is usually displeasing. // In choosing bric-a-brac for decoration or use , keep in mind the principles of simplicity and harmony . Rhythmic lines that How one into another are the most beautiful . Some ornaments may serve a use other than beauty , as jardincres of brass or pottery , brass candlesticks , trays , and howls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , but a cluttered shelf or " whatnot " full of bric-a-brac is a disturbing element in the repose of any room . Many of these things are valuable , but not from the standpoint of the home maker who has the principles of simplicity and harmony iii mind . A few flowers , well arranged , or some growing plants add much to the attractiveness of a home , and are far more beautiful and graceful than cheap vases , statuary , and other useless , dust-collecting atrocities . The furnishing of the bedroom . ? A bedroom is primarily a place for rest . Sometimes it serves also the purpose of sitting room or study for individual members of the family . If it serves this double purpose , furnishings may be introduced that one would not put into a room used only for sleeping and dressing . There should be a comfortable place for reading , for writing , and for sleeping ; these are the essentials of the combination room . The room should have only the most simple furnishings and those which can easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be situated on the sunny side of the house . The floor should be of wood with rugs ; light-color values are preferable for the walls and woodwork in bedrooms , and the curtains and bed valances , if used , should be such as can easily and frequently be laundered . Metal beds are the most sanitary . The mattress and springs can be kept in good condition with fitted muslin covers . The bed should be comfortable . Good springs and mattresses are an economy . One third of life is spent in bed , and // efficiency depends much on the way one rests ; therefore thought should be given to the selection of bed furnishings . Good light blankets , sheets of right width , and good pillows all add to comfort . A few well-placed pictures are restful , but too many are distracting and have no place in a room intended for rest unless they are of personal interest to the occupant . Few ornaments are necessary . They add to the labor of cleaning the room . Beware of the room cluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which collect dust and possibly disease germs . Wicker furniture with muslin and chintz curtains is well adapted to the furnishing of some bedrooms ( see Figs. // 33 and 34 ) . Old mahogany pieces or reproductions of them are always interesting . Brass beds when of very simple design are good , and white metal beds always cleanly and attractive . Bedroom furniture in " sets " is not always the most pleasing furnishing for the bedroom . Chairs of varying styles add interest to a room , and relieve the monotony of set pieces . The bedroom should provide a place for the storage of clothing . There should be a comfortable chair well placed with regard to light for reading by day or night , and a study desk or table for writing purposes . " Cottage furniture " for bedroom purposes , where expense must be considered , is attractive , relieved with a comfortable wicker chair or two . The bathroom . The furnishings for this room should be as simple as possible . The walls are most sanitary if painted , and the addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they can be kept clean . The aim should be the maximum of comfort and cleanliness with the least care . The floors can be tiled , painted , or of hard wood , and the woodwork painted or varnished . There should be a comfortable rug and a bat hniat . Bath tubs resting on their own base rather than on feet are more cleanly , as dust can not collect beneath , and rounded corners and edges of the room are more sanitary . There should be plenty of rods and hooks for towels according to the number using the room . It is preferable to have a sunny bathroom . It should be well ventilated and the plumbing absolutely without question . Mirrors and a closet or cabinet are almost indispensable , and a small stool adds greatly to comfort . A basket or bag for soiled clothing is a necessity ( see Fig. 16 ) . The dining room . ? This room should offer cheer and comfort , for in it much of the social life of the home takes // place . The wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be too dull . Wainscoting is effective in some dining rooms . In others the paper is so arranged that the lower part of the wall is in plain color and a wide border ( 4 height of wall ) is applied above . An open fireplace that can be used adds to the cheer . The furniture ? table , chairs , and side table ? should be care-fully selected . Large pieces should not be chosen for a small dining room , and simple outlines are much more agree-able than heavy carving and claw-and-ball feet , which collect // dust and are cumbersome ( see Fig. 35 ) . A few wellplaced pictures of general interest are decorative , and plants add much to the cozy effect . The floor is most hygienic if of wood with a rug that can be removed and cleaned frequently . One large rug is preferable in a dining room to several small ones , and one of not too deep pile is more cleanly . Body Brussels and Wilton are serviceable if one can not afford an Oriental rug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good taste in a dining room . Plate rails collect dust . A few articles of table service , candelabra , or a dish or two may be attractively placed on the side table or sideboard . Dishes and most silver should be kept in closets rather than displayed in china closets with glass fronts . Few dishes are really good art . The sideboard with a long drawer for linen and shallow drawers for silver is serviceable . The curtains in a dining room should be placed to admit good light . Scrim , net , and simple muslins are best for the modest home . When there is an interesting view of garden or landscape from the dining room , a large window carefully curtained to disclose the view adds much to the charm and beauty of the room ( see Fig. 36 ) . The living room . ? The same general principles of simplicity , beauty , and comfort should be applied in the furnishing of the living room . In few modest homes of to-day can a room be spared for occasional use as parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and library , may be so planned that one 's friends can be entertained there rather than in a stiff parlor ( see Fig. 37 ) . In most homes where entertaining is of an informal nature the " parlor " of former days is no longer known . The living room should offer cheer and comfort , and good common sense should be used in the selection of furnishings , // useful as well as beautiful ( see Fig. 38 ) . It is here that the family assembles and friends are entertained , therefore comfort and harmonious furnishings should greet the occupants . Soft-colored wall coverings of one or two values or a simple pattern , with woodwork to harmonize , are preferable . A wood floor with small rugs or one large rug , a fireplace with comfortable chairs or davenport near , a couch and pillows well placed , a good table for lamp and books , a desk with a good light ? are the essentials . Bookcases can be arranged in this room if there is no separate library ( see Fig. 37 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old-fashioned " sets " of upholstered tufted furniture // are no longer considered desirable . A few wicker chairs in the living room add greatly to the degree of comfort ; they are easy to move about , and can be ordered in colors to harmonize with the furnishings . Avoid cluttering ; have only the essentials of comfort , convenience , and beauty . Curtains should be simple and arranged to admit light and air . Plants , a few dignified vases , a bowl of brass , some well-chosen prints of good subjects will be found sufficient decoration . Arrange the furniture in relation to light with the idea of comfort for reading , writing , and the other home activities in this much-used room . The reception room . ? In many houses a small reception room is almost a necessity . It is a room for occasional use , and when space permits , can be utilized to great advantage . It is there that people can be received who are not admitted to the intimacies of living room or library . It may conFURNISHING // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the house must practice . The treatment of this room should be formal . As a whole it should be in lighter color value than the living room . It is the place where choice pictures should be hung , ? some oil paintings , when not too heavy , and selected etchings . Avoid gilt furniture , statuary , and other frivolous furnish ings without use or beauty . A well-finished floor with a few good rugs , dignified chairs and sofa , a palm or other plant well placed , and the piano and stool , make it a place for formal use . // The hall of every home should represent to the visitor son let hing of the ideals and standards of taste of the family . There should greet the visitor orderliness , cheer , and dignity , ? an introduction to the life within . Very little furnishing is necessary . The essentials are few , a chair where space permits , an umbrella stand , a place for hanging a few wraps or hats , and a mirror . If space permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coats , rubbers , and gloves should not be deposited in the hall space ; a closet at the rear is quite necessary , or a few hooks screened . The wall and floor covering should be chosen with care . It should express cheer and dignity . Unless the hall is very // large , small patterns of wall paper look best , and stripes are usually a success unless the stairway is very long and the lines accentuate the height . The floor covering should be unobtrusive , and of a color that will not show soil or footprints . Many ugly pieces of hall furniture destroy all feeling of harmony and beauty . A simply framed mirror and a good chair are decidedly to be preferred . Curtains of muslin , scrim , or silk are serviceable . A golden-colored china silk with brown hall furnishings adds light and cheer . The kitchen . ? The greatest care should be exercised in furnishing the kitchen . It is of primary importance that everything in it be easily kept clean . There are numerous floor coverings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be kept clean easily and lasts a long time . The selection of wall covering , paint , and woodwork should be as carefully made as for the living room , and with the same idea of harmony in color and line . The kitchen furnishings should be so arranged that energy and time are saved . A small room where articles are at hand is most convenient . A light arranged near the stove and good light near the sink are essential . Furnishings to promote the comfort of the worker , a high stool , a sink of sufficient height to prevent backache , convenient utensils near at hand , and provision for the protection of all articles from dust should be carefully considered in furnishing this very important room . The kitchen should be carefully screened ? both at windows and doors . A plant or two on the window sill furnishes cheer . A good clock and a book shelf for cookbooks are necessary . // PART II TEXTILES : MATERIALS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE CHAPTER VIII COTTON Reasons for the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her rests the responsibility in household affairs of making each dollar procure full value . Many women spend foolishly , and this is due principally to igno-rance . Women should have a knowledge of textiles so that the materials used in the household for clothing and furnishings may be purchased intelligently . This knowl-edge means a study of the processes of modern manu-facture of materials , their properties , and the laws governing the adulterations and fraudulent labeling of materials . In the present day of high prices , it is essential that girls , who sooner or later assume the responsibilities of the home , should make a study of these important things . Cotton is the most common and the cheapest of the important textile fibers used in the manufacture of materials . It is a vegetable fiber , and a cotton field of unfolding bolls with the soft white cotton fibers within is a lovely sight ( see Fig. 40 ) . Cotton is the white , downy covering of the seeds that are borne in the capsule after the beautiful flower has disappeared ( see Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h its soft covering so that , in the wild state , the wind would catch the fiber and carry the seeds far and ? le . Where grown . ? Cotton is a native of many countries . ( ' olinnbus found it growing in the West Indies and Cortez in Peru . Theophrastus wrote about cotton in India three centuries before Christ . Biblical references mention cotton as early as 519 B.C. Herodotus , " the father of History , ? in his book of travels speaks of the cotton plant . There are , however , many myths and fables as to its nature and origin . It was supposed by some to be a tree in which the buds yielded tiny , woolly lambs which stooped and grazed about the plant . The principal countries producing it to-day are the United States , India , Egypt , and Brazil . In our own country , about 30,000,000 acres are devoted to cultivation of cotton , and about 15,000,000 bales are produced annually . Texas leads the states in the production of cotton . The fiber depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy , loamy soil which will retain the proper amount of moisture as well as heat . It grows best between 35 ? north latitude and 45 ? south . Varieties of cotton . ? The value of the cotton fiber depends upon its quality . Strength , length , and evenness are affected by the soil and climatic conditions ( see Fig. 42 ) . Over one hundred varieties are known by the agriculturist . A microscopical examination of the cotton fiber shows that a fully developed ripe fiber has the appearance of a piece of twisted rubber tubing ( see Fig. 87 ) . The twist is of great economic importance and aids in spinning as well as producing a more elastic fabric . Its length varies from one half to two and one half inches , usually one to one and one half inches . Unripe fibers do not swell or twist as much and consequently do not accept the dye as readily . They can // be easily distinguished if used in colored cotton fabrics . The most . important species of cotton are the Gossypium herbaceum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and G. peruvia.nurn . Within these five species over one hundred varieties ' are recognized . Gossypium herbaceum bears a short fiber or staple , and the seeds are covered with a short gray down . The plant grows about five feet in height and bears a yellow flower . Many varieties of Egyptian and Indian cotton are in this class . The cottons called " Nankeen cottons " are made from the fiber of this variety . This grows in China and India and is yellow in color . Gossypium barbadense is a long staple cotton . The plant grows to be eight or ten feet in height and bears also a yellow blossom ( see Fig. 43 ) . The seeds are black and smooth , and unlike other varieties . Sea Island cotton is of this species and grows chiefly off the coast of Florida and Georgia . This species grows best by the sea and yields the finest // grade of cotton , since its staple is silky and from one to two inches in length . Gossypium hirsutum is so called because its leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . The plant grows to be six feet in height . The fiber is short and the seeds covered with soft green down . Gossypium arboreum grows higher than other cotton , about twenty feet at maximum . It is also called religiosum because the variety was used in spinning priests ' robes in India . The fiber is short and the seeds covered with green fuzz . The flowers of the plant are brown and purple-red . Gossypium. peruvianum is considered a native of Peru and Brazil , and has all the characteristics of the barbadense . It is harsh and rather wiry in fiber and is used for wool adulteration because of this characteristic . Cotton culture in the United States . ? The United States produces three fourths of all cotton used . It was not until 1621 that it was grown for fiber in this country . It has become since then one of the most important crops in the world . This is largely due to the wonderful inventions in cotton machinery during the last three hundred years . Cotton planters prepare their fields in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the picking begins about the middle of August and lasts until December . This period is a most anxious one for the farmer . IIe prefers light showery weather for the best development of his crop . Frosts are most destructive . There are many enemies which the farmer has to fight : the boll weevil , the cotton caterpillar , the bollworm , lice , and fungous growths . A large quantity of cotton is destroyed annually in this way . The United States government has rendered much assistance in studying these pests , but much is still to be done . One acre will produce a crop of from three to six hundred pounds of cotton . // Estimates of the cost per pound of growing cotton vary from five to nine cents . In the old days cotton was grown principally by the planters , who had large areas under cultivation with armies of slaves . It is now also grown by the small farmers who own their farms or rent them and also work on shares . Labor is so uncertain that owners of land can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who helps in the work . The cotton is gathered by young and old . This is a tedious task . The cotton grown in the field must be put into marketable shape . It is taken from f he field to the gin house where it is cleaned and the seed removed . Each cotton boll contains from thirty to forty seeds , and each tiny fiber is attached at one end to a seed . The process of separating seed from the fiber is called ginning . After it is ginned , the cotton is baled . Let us study more in detail about these two processes . Cotton ginning . ? Most of the cotton of to-day is ginned by machinery . In India and China the foot gins and other primitive types are still used . The primitive hand types are somewhat like a household clothes-wringing machine . The rollers separate , but do not clean very well ? and the process is a slow one . A woman using the " churka gin " could separate three pounds per clay at a wage of five cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one gin , it is possible to gin enough cotton to make a bale of five hundred pounds . Eli Whitney invented the saw cotton gin , for which a patent was issued by George Washington in 1794 . Water power was soon used in running these saw gin mills . The manufacture of cotton cloth could never have become a great industry but for this American invention . It was needed because of the wonderful improvements in spinning and weaving machinery , and this gin made possible a large supply of the raw material . The saw gin is made of a series of circular saws . The cotton is delivered // to the gin box , one side of which is grated . The saws revolve through this grid , which is fine enough to permit the fiber to be drawn through but not the seed . The seeds are heavy and fall , and are used later for various by-products . The fiber thus pulled from the seeds by the saws is brushed off by a revolving brush and delivered from the machine . Much American cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the saw gin operating too quickly . This gin can clean under average conditions about three hundred pounds per hour . Cotton is also ginned by means of the roller gin , which is perhaps less destructive . This was the primitive method . The best long staple cotton , the Sea Island , is ginned on the modern roller gin . The saw gin is better adapted to the upland or short staple cotton . One early form of roller gin invented by Mr. Bissell of Georgia was used as early as 1788 . Mr. McCarthy of Alabama invented a roller gin in 1840 , and with steam power this gin will pro-duce about one thousand pounds or two bales per day . The gin houses and baling presses were formerly on the planta- // tions , but now the processes of ginning and baling are completed at central points . Cotton baling . ? The cotton is delivered from the gin to the baling press . Boxes the shape of the American cotton hale are prepared with jute bagging and the cotton delivered into them . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other is pressed by means of a screw . This hale usually weighs about five hundred pounds , and fifteen hundred pounds of seed cotton are used in producing it . After being bound with sheet-iron bands it is ready for the local market or mill . The size of the American bale is about 54 " X 27 " X 16 " . For shipping at steamboat piers as ocean freight , it is necessary to reduce the size , as rates are fixed according to space occupied . The machines used to reduce the size of the bales are called compressors , and are so powerful that the bale can be compressed to seven inches in thickness . This means great economy in transportation . Bales are shipped also by rail and from local mills by river boats to ports . The American system of round bales has been much discussed as to relative merit . The cotton from the gin is rolled in a lap as one would roll a bandage or a roll of tape on a spool . The air is pressed out and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very easily handled and unrolled at the mill , and is in better condition because of proper wrapping of cotton cloth which protects and keeps it clean . It is called the Bessonette cylindrical bale . The Egyptian cotton bale is a trifle longer than the American and weighs seven hundred pounds . The Indian bales are about four hundred pounds in weight . Cotton is shipped from the United States to Liverpool , Bremen , Havre , and Genoa , and to other ports in Spain , Japan , and India . We import cotton from Egypt principally , but also from // Peru and from India . The long fiber , imported Egyptian cotton is used for fine cotton goods requiring long staple , as sewing thread , underwear , cotton hosiery . The business of shipping cotton is transacted by great exporting companies . Each bale is so marked that it can be traced through each step of its journeying . Cotton by-products . ? Formerly the farmers wasted most of the cotton by-products , seed and stalks only being utilized . To-day the seed is first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hulls of the seeds are then removed and are used for fertilizer . The green kernels of the seeds are pressed and the oils used for various purposes , such as salad oil , cooking fats , soaps , candles , according to the refinement . The remains of the pressed kernel are ground to make the cottonseed meal used as food for cattle . It has been estimated that one ton of seed will produce 30 pounds of lint , 950 pounds of hull , 40 gallons of oil , and 675 pounds of meal . Cotton yarn manufacture .  --  The bales , whether round or square , eventually reach the mill . There many processes are necessary before the yarn is finally spun and ready to be used in the weaving of cotton fabrics , the making of cotton thread , or for the knitting machines which consume much cotton yarn in the manufacture of underwear and hosiery . The cotton on arrival at the mill is first weighed . Sometimes after the bales are opened several qualities are mixed according to the quality of yarn to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . The cotton must then be cleansed , and this is done in the picker machines by means of air currents which beat the cotton against cylinders until the dirt , seeds , and stones are removed . The final picker machine delivers the cotton cleansed in a lap like the cylindrical bale . The cotton is next treated at carding machines . // These cleanse still more , and by means of flat cards covered with small wire teeth the fibers of the cotton are laid parallel ( see Fig. 44 ) . The cotton roll or lap is delivered at the hack of the machine and leaves it at the front , cleansed and carded ? a gossamer web which is the width of the machine , but is reduced to a coarse rope of cotton called a sliver as it passes into the cylindrical cans prepared to receive it . During this process short , broken , and unripe fibers are removed . The cans of cotton slivers are placed next before the drawing and doubling machines except when the cotton is to be combed as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fine and strong yarn is required . A great deal of waste is made by the use of this machine , for only the best fibers for good yarn are wanted . The comb is made up of fine teeth on rollers , which remove the short // fibers and straighten out the long ones . The cotton from the carding machine is in the form of slivers and must be prepared for the combing machine . This is done in a sliver lap machine which prepares the slivers into laps ten inches wide which are ready for the comb . The cotton is delivered from the comb in the form of slivers which are delivered in cans ready for the drawing and doubling frames or machines . The purpose of these machines is to pass a number of slivers together between rollers and draw them out so as to equalize the strength of all . Several slivers may enter the back of the machine together and be delivered in front as one attenuated stronger sliver . We now have a cleansed cotton with fibers lying as nearly parallel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ropelike form of cotton . In order that this soft sliver or rope may not break , it is necessary to put iii some twist as the sliver is drawn out gradually until it is a fine yarn . The cotton is passed through bobbin and fly frames to accomplish this twisting . There are several of these frames , the slubber , the intermediate roving frame , the roving frame , and the jack roving . All cotton does not pass through the full set of frames , but through those only that will accomplish the aim of the manufacturer . The cotton is delivered at the back of the machines on spools or bobbins . The first frame in this set has large spools with a thick roving and the last before spinning a much smaller spool with a finer roving . This reduction in size is accomplished by the bobbin and fly frames , which draw out the rovings as they pass between rollers and put irr a twist which makes the attenuating possible . The twisted roving on bobbins or spools is a very different looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames . This twisted roving , closely resembling thick yarn , is ready now
