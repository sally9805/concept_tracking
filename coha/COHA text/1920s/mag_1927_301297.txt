Last week , Watts Gunn of Georgia Tech , playmate of Robert Tyre Jones Jr. , went four times around the Garden City ( L. I. ) Golf Club course in a total of 302 strokes . Had he been alive to do this in 1902 , he would have won the U. S. Open Championship by five strokes. * But , at 22 , his reward was the qualifying medal of the national intercollegiate golf tournament . <P> Consistently but not brilliantly , Golfer Gunn battered his way to the finals where he found the other favorite , Roland Mackenzie of Brown University , his good friend , with nerves set for a 36-hole struggle . <P> Beginning at the fifth hole of their first round , Golfer Gunn went stark , staring golf-mad , made six birdies , used only nine putts on seven consecutive holes-putts varying between 35 and 12 feet-sunk with a borrowed putter . His score for the first 18 holes was 69 , breaking the course record by two strokes . After that it was only a matter of time before Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . <P> Another figure in the tournament was John D. Ames , blond son of Knowlton L. ( " Snake " ) Ames ( sinuous Princeton quarterback of the strenuous ' 90s ) , who lost to Watts Gunn in the second round but was elected president of the Intercollegiate Golf Association . <P> <P> * Runner-up would have been Lawrence Auchterlonie who , as it was , won with 307 strokes .
