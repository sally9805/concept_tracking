txt To Conductor " : I read with great Interest your letter pulilished Oct , 19 In the Post . I regret that you did not sign " your name in full so that I might address you personally , I notice you say that you are one of the old timers ; that , you have worked for the railroad for over a Ouprter of a century . I , too , have spent almost my entire business career on the Northwestern . Next April I will have finished a half century of uninterrupted service . During all this period of time I have felt that a spirit of comradeship existed between the Northwestern employes and the executive cfficers , and have exerted every effort , consistent with my duties to the property , in the interest of the employes and in an effort to , properly discharge the transportation obligations to the shipping public . It is with a mingled feeling of rogret and sadness that I now learn that the Northwestern railway is to be in the first zone of attack In an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' system . And may I ask what for ? Why is this attack made against the Northwestern ? Do the employes . have some present dispute with the-management ? Have you been to the president , the vice president , and the general manager in an effort to settle your griev- ances ? What is the dispute ? - The leaders of your brotherhoods. say you are striking against the wage . award , effective July.1 , 1921 . But your , representatives participated in the hearing before the labor board , offered their evidence , submitted their argp ? meats , and , after full and complete hearing , the labor board , . an instrumentality of the federal government , in accordance with the law of congress , made a decision ' regarding wages . And this railroad has complied with that deIn your letter you sar you are willing to take the cut of July 1 , but that you can not take another one until the cost of living has been reduced . Your officers have not asked you to take another cut at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this subject , and you have not met with your executive officers for the purpose of discussing any such question as the law requires even ' before any application is made to the labor board , and yet you propose to strike in response to a call which bases the strike upon the wage cut with which you say you are satisfied . It you have fear of a further reduc ? tion in wages , then permit me to call your attention to the record which the Northwestern company made at the last hearing on the subject before the United States labor board . In his closing arguments at that time our Mr. Sargent stated that It was the purpose of thin company to obey the decisions of the labor board and to strictly observe the law to the minutest detail'at all times ankunder all circumstances . That statement had my full approval and still stands as the policy of this company . There has been no intention of re ? clueing wages further without first conferring with you and our other employes in the manner as pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not reach an amt .. : cable and friendly settlement , then , there can still be no rrduction ? in wages until after we have applied to the United States labor board and have certified to that board that we were unable to agree . The board will then set our dispute down for a hear-1 ! lig . At such a time you will be.rep-1 resented and will be given an opportii-1 nity to be heard , just as you were . when the board ordered reductions of between 10 and , 12 per cent effective July 1 , 1921 . At this hearing you will be given the opportunity to offer all of your evidence , to present all the facts and all the argdments against a reduction in wages , and the board will then decide whether conditions have so changed since their decision effective July ? 1 , 0921 , that there should be a further reduction in wages . We be ? 1 lieve that such decision will be based ; squarely and Impartially upon the evi- ' donee produced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so changed that some further reduc- ' ' tion In wages should be ordered , they ! will so decide . If , on the other hand , they should find that conditions have not so changed as to justify further reductions , they will decide accord . ingly and dismiss the application . Whatever this may be , this railroad ' will obey it , We obeyed the decision of the board when in 1920 they directed us to increase . wages approximately 22 per cent . We obeyed their decision in 1921 1 when they directed a reduction of between le and 12 per cent . We will ' obey any future decision , and there will be no reduction of your compen.1 Isatien , or that of any other employes coming under the jurisdiction of the United States labor board , without the approval of that bodyi I was pleased to have you say ' that you and your fellow ' employes have al ? ways considered yourselves as of the Northwestern family , and it is ' my most earnest hope that you will con-1 tinue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue as I have now stated it you will agree with me that the proposed strike ' . upon the Northwestern Is not justified .
