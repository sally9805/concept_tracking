Everyone is sorry for professors ; the idea is not a new one . It makes no student happy to see his learned and witty instructor pushing a baby-carriage because he can not afford a nurse , wearing butter and eggs on his old vest because he can not afford a new vest , slushing along without rubbers because he can not afford a wife . Too bad ; they ought to get more money . Editors have said it , bankers , statesmen , industrialists have said it ; the country ought to raise their salaries . How much of a raise has generally been left vague , but not by one Frank Bohn , who wrote an article for the October Forum , " Professors Should Get $50,000 a Year . " <P> That universities can afford to pay this , Dr. Bohn maintains in good scholarly fashion by printing a list of some recent donations to institutions of the " higher " learning , and adding up the sum-$1,585,500,000 . Said he : <P> " Pay one hundred professors a minimum salary of $30,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public ... They should receive from $30,000 to $50,000 annually . The tendency should be , unless the cost of living falls off sharply , to pay the higher sum generally . . . . This nation spends many hundreds of millions a year upon chewing gum and candy ... a half-billion on military and naval aviation since the war . . . billions for pleasure automobiles . Our contention here is that it is not being used to the best advantage . . . . " <P> Were such salaries paid , many men of intellect now preoccupied with the details of business , law or war , could withdraw from active life and lend their minds , unharassed , to the service of human thought-men like Elihu Root , John Hay , Admiral Mahan , Steinmetz . Scholarship would come into its heritage ; universities would be dignified . " Our typical ' University ' of today would gradually find its place in the new system . Perhaps no great harm comes from assembling these vast crowds of healthy , noisy , young people . Let them enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university ? "
