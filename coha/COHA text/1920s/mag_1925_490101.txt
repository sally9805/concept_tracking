Is beauty , one wondered , ever amateur ? Is it not the most professional of all professional matters ? To a man it would seem so . But woman may know better . And if there is a distinction  --  if we are to have amateur and professional beauties  --  why should not the Atlantic City promoters take a leaf from golf 's book and hold an open championship , wherein the two classes may meet ?

I thought of cigarettes , perhaps , because I remembered the Winter nights Anderson spent , in partnership with Laurence Stallings , in the making of " What Price Glory . " Mr. Anderson had no Packard then . He lived in a little apartment in Bank Street , and tried to do his writing in a narrow room that he had to share with his children . To find privacy , he found a retreat in the huge rooms of the Public Library , and in the deep silences there labored over the script of the play , with what deft hand we now are well aware . But there is a rule against smoking at the Public Library . Mr. Anderson tells me that he obeyed it , too  --  though he grimaced at the recollection . I doubt exceedingly that there are many writing folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of their tobacco . Rather , they will endure the discomforts and hubbub of their makeshift studios  --  perhaps at grievous cost to the literature of the nation . I am willing to head a movement toward the granting of smoking privileges at the Library . It has been suggested that a room he set aside for writers , with redoubled restrictions in the matter of silence , but with full smoking rights for all . The plan must be kept secret from the reformers , however . ? XTHLTR HOPKINS loquitur : Twenty years , and New York will no longer be the theatrical center of America . Theater groups in cities all through America will he producing native plays in intelligent fashion . More important , they will be sound , satisfying plays , providing the provincial population with thoroughgoing entertainment .

Styles THOSE English tailors will not stay put , murmured the Gentleman in the Know , whose Fall clothing spoke quietly of Bond Street . Just when our more conservative dressers were reconciled to the wide shouldered sack coat , tapering to snugness about the hips , the Britishers have fashioned their coats to fall more fully . Shoulders are much the same , and the coat 's length is still rather short , however , added the Gentleman in the Know . They have found , too , a practical use for the buttons on the side of the coat sleeves , for the first time since they were invented to permit gay blades of other years to roil up their sleeves and button them back for sword play , continued the Gentleman in the Know . The English have made the buttonholes actual instead of ornamental in sport clothes , and the bottom of the sleeves somewhat wider , so that they may be rolled back by the golfer on days when a sweater can not be worn , which is often enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least of this season 's Rus- sian movements arc the plans we have been hearing for the construction of an all-Slavic metropolis , to be named New Petrograd , and located in the environs of South Plainfield , New Jersey . The genius behind this segregating move is M. Vladimir Bouimisdro ? , a stately gentleman of the old school , head of the Russian Aid Society who daily travels Jersey-ward to superintend the grading work already begun . Only last week I spoke to M. Bouimisdroff at tea , but he continues a most conservative realtor . He admits , however , that the American-Russian Engineering Society has taken 120 lots ( which sell at from one to three hundred dollars ) and proposes a club house which shall ring to Volga boating songs ; Madam de Krouleff will build a tea house . Agofonoff , the painter , will journey thither . However , M. Bouirnisdroff explains , New Petrograd is not to be secluded haunt of the remnants of the old regime , but an industrial city which welcomes all castes . WHILE Vanity Fair offers by advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer chic , " I continue to consider that one of the nearest New York approaches to a salon is Madame Smoliani 's charming apartment in West Fifty-ninth Street overlooking the Park . Madame Smoliani is one of those Russians , who are much easier to find than one supposes , who has a title and prefers not to use it . Her husband , Prince Zavolotsky , was Housemaster to the former Czar , of distinguished family from Krimy on the Black Sea . After five o'clock one is bound to find ( or hear gossip of ) Chez-Smoliani , all our permanent guests of the old regime . Among them there is that most aloof of gentlemen , His Highness , Grand Duke Dimitri , nephew of the Czar , Son of Grand Duke Alexander Michael , and a brother of Princess Irene Yousoupoff  --  Madarne Bakieff , whose father was Genera !

The latest acquirer of a place of business is the tiny Princess Ouchtomsky , hand-painter of dresses and gowns in Russian motif , who has only just established herself in Madison Avenue . Reverence MR . DAVID BELASCO 'S clerical collar always has commanded respect , but few had suspected , even with this evidence forever before them , that his reverence was so deep as lately it has been shown to be . The story confirming Mr. Belasco 's supreme faith has been told about widely in the last few days , but , for the sake of those few who have not heard it , the account of a fortunate eavesdropper is presented . During the tryout of " Canary Dutch " at Stamford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the second night , Mr. Belasco summoned his company . In the dim , religious half-lights of the stage , he delivered a solemn message . " This success is not due to you , " he assured his troupe . " Nor is it due to the author . Nor is it due to me , " said Mr. Belasco , with humble modesty . He adjusted his clerical collar and concluded , impressively , " It is due solely to God ! " Accommodation TT is always a point of amazement 1 . with suburban friends to be told , when they are held in town unexpectedly , that almost every hotel in town can supply their overnight needs , although , strangely , no pajamas are available . Only the old-fashioned night gown is furnished to the transient and forlorn male , and in many cases these have the names of the hotel embroidered in big letters across their chest , much after the style affected by the playboys of Grahams-vine Hose and Pumping Company . The Bowman chain of hotels supply the most elaborate outfit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety razor and soaps , all in a sanitary package . The more fashionable places have not surrendered the older conception of the dignity of travel sufficiently to make special preparations for the last-minute guest , but even these now have emergency nightgear in their linen closets , which is available to those in the know and the good graces of the night clerk . Yesterday YEARLY our faith in the charm of our city is revived by perusal of a fresh issue of " Valentine 's Manual of Old New York . " The latest volume has just come into our hands from its author , Mr. Henry Collins Brown , the gentleman who ten years ago took it upon himself to revive old Valentine 's tradition , after a lapse of fifty years following the faithful clerk 's death . From a collection of contemporary statistics , " Valentine 's Manual , " under Mr. Brown 's guidance , has come to he a charmed ambling through the vistas of Manhattan 's past . This year 's work is devoted to the last fifty years . Such strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1874 . New York depended for protection from fire on towers , such as the Forest Rangers use to-day  --  tall skeletons with winding stairways , a-top which sat observers with telescopes . One tower is shown in the manual with an early sketch by Winslow Homer , then a youth on Harper 's Weekly . Memories of the old toboggan slide at One Hundred Tenth Street , of the first telephones and electric lights , of the coming of the elevated flow together with intimate pictures of daily life of the city , the modes and manners and superstitions , the fads and fancies of a day hardly passed , and yet , in this strange Western World , already history . And last and least , as we glance through , a tiny cut of two negro ragamuffins , " dancing for eels " by the old Catherine Street Market . Change not a gesture , but merely sketch the entrance to a Broadway theatre behind them , and the drawing is a picture not of 188o but of 1925 entr'act Charleston dancers .

Geraldine Farrar was there , probably drawn by the memory of the days when she and the star of the piece were slaving divinities under the lash of Samuel Goldwyn Esq. , Gentleman . That evening in the sticks was nothing to write to the shade of Edwin Booth about , but it was amusing to see the lady who kept Sir James Barrie waiting an hour in Mayfair while she paddled in her tub , standing against the background of the fearsome Stamfordian make-up cell after the fall of the final curtain .

And then she herself presented a worshipful young man with a large tin of cigarettes with the announcement that she had given up smoking because it affected her voice . She had made the startling discovery that theatre and studio are not the same . Wheat Cakes WITH the realization that Childs ' Realty Company is in possession of the site of the Savoy Hotel in Fiftyeighth Street and Fifth Avenue , there is a growing belief that in time an even more magnificent Childs restaurant will be added to the elegant series that has been creeping into the fashionable shopping district . It simply is n't possible to be democratic any more . One had no sooner discovered the novelty of winding up an hilarious evening at breakfast among the flannel-shirted proletariat in one of the Broadway Childs , than that institution must march right up to Fifth Avenue , establish itself behind a fashionable address , grilled fronts and gold curtains , and become very , very de luxe . We may even live to see gilded hot dog wagons next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? Obeisance to the code of the Fifth Avenue Association has led to a most ungrateful denial of the Childs ' origin . The restaurant at Thirty-sixth Street is the only one on the Avenue to display the historic Childs ' sign . Neither the cafeteria Childs in the Holland Building nor the latest and most elaborate restaurant at Forty-eighth Street have the flapjack flapper in the window . And prices are slightly higher than on Broadway . There had even been a report that Childs had banished chewing gum from its emporia above Forty-second Street , but breathless investigation proved that this rumor was baseless . Horses THE glory has not departed wholly from the horse , when the season just coming to an end can boast twenty-five horse shows  --  held , or to be held  --  within a day 's drive of town . Interest , of course , centers chiefly about jumpers , or hacks . That is to say , the horse survives for saddle purposes , while the four-in-hand and the phaeton beauties command chiefly , reminiscent , or academic regard . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goshen , in the glow of early Fall , thrills to its lovely week-end meet , wherein Mr. W. Averill Harriman is accustomed to guide his horses in the spirited brushes each afternoon . A gorgeous spot , Goshen , and the track is a beautiful sight , although the sparse sprinkle of spectators in the stands proves that it is not appreciated as it should be . The horse has one friend less since the untimely death of Mr. Reginald Vanderbilt , whose activities for many years helped make the Newport shows successes . But other horsemen , mourning their associate , are still active . In the Jersey district the Far Hills show is imminent , with the Schleys , Pines , Pierreponts , Kissels and others in judpors , those amazingly close-fitting breeches , and A. F. Hyde , M. F. H. , at Peapack very much in evidence ; and the Morristown show is to come , where Otto Kahn used to indulge his pocketbook before he grew musical . In Plainfield they will also cavort .

Her new role is not merely an addition to the crowded gallery of florid ladies she has portrayed in the course of her colorful career . Zaza , of beloved memory , Du Barry , Mrs. Tanquery , and Lady Catherine Champion-Cheney in the " Circle , " are only fragrant wild flowers compared to Madam Goddam , presiding evil genius of a Shanghai brothel in the new play written for her by John Colton , author of " Rain . " Here her palace will not be one of silks and scented down but a temple where tough cosmopolitan votaries hang garlands of empty bottles over a doorway leading to the darkest den of Asiatic iniquity . Expansion TENNIS  --  one is led to reflect by the popularity of the Davis Cup matches  --  no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has grown beyond the narrow limits of the elect . Too big for Newport ; too expensive for Southampton . Neither colony can supply to-day the enormous playing fields , the huge stadia and the elaborate guest quarters needed for the proper conducting of an important tournament . So control of tennis has passed from Newport and Southampton  --  that is , from society  --  into the hands of the body of thorough sportsmen who govern for the U. S. Lawn Tennis Association . And with that passage has come a change in the galleries which attend big matches . Once composed almost exclusively of tennis players themselves , they are now almost wholly non-players , as much so , for example , as are the crowds at the big football games . It was a natural transition , regretted , perhaps , by the Newport and Southampton colony , for there was much glamor and excitement in the old tennis weeks at both resorts . But the game has grown too big . It is world-wide now . The Davis Cup matches made it so . And any sport which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely social . The Long Island set found it was so when , in polo , the Hurlingham Cup matches began to attract international attention . Criticism AGENTLEMAN whom it is my delight to call The Critic of the Critics , has for years made a hobby of comparing the current theatrical criticisms with the facts about stage folk which he has marvelously preserved in his capacious memory . There is hardly a theatrical writer in town , he tells me , whom he does not catch in inaccuracy , week after week . Thus from the Daily News he cites : " Appearing on the stage for the first time in thirty-five years , Augustus Thomas , called the dean of American playwrights , played the leading role in his new play , ' Still Waters , ' in Stamford , Conn. , last night . " Well , murmured the Critic of the Critics , Mr. Thomas played the role of Mr. Kallan in his own play , " Nemesis , " at the Hudson Theatre , in 1921 , which is not yet thirty-five years ago . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Morning Tele-graph : " Bertha Kalich , renowned for her performance in the well-remembered Kreutzer Sonata , ' is to return to the Broadway stage soon . She will he starred in ' Magda , ' by Herman Sundermann , the well-known German playwright , author of Heimat ! Magda ' has never been produced in this country . " Which , aside from calling Hermann Suderman out of his name , overlooks such an important event as Mme. Modjeska 's performance in " Magda " in 1894 , and the more recent performances here in the same play of Mme. Duse , Mrs. Fiske , Mrs. Patrick Campbell , Nance O'Neil , Olga Nethersole , Sarah Bernhardt , and Laura Hope Crews . A slight oversight , to say the least , murmured the Critic of the Critics .
