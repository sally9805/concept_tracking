President of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company , yesterday when he testified at a hearing before the Transit Commission on the lnterborough 's petition for a reduction in service during the Summer months . In the course of the investigation , Mr. Keegan disclosed that what the Interborough Itapid Transit Company really desired was an order from the Tfansit ' Commission authorizing a curtailment of service during the nonrush hour periods on the local tracks for the next eleven months . Geo  --  ge , Chairman of the Transit Commission , frankly informed the witness that the plea . of a falling off , in traffic in support of the petition for curtailed service did not appeal to him very much . , " The argument that there should be a change in schedules merely because the subway is carrying less passengers in the Summer in and of itself does not impress me. " further said the Chairman of the Transit Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thee - are put , without fault except that of circumstances , are required to carry a great many more than they can comfortably accommodate , the fact that they are required to carry less in the Summer time may mean nothing more than that they are closer to the kind of service that they ought to give . " The thing that impresses me chiefly is your physical need in the matter of the condition of your equipment and the lack of adequate repair facilities . If that need is recognized , then the question is what are the comparative figures in the train service of today ? " Twenty Per Cent . tinder Last Winter . The witness said that there had been a reduction of 20 per cent . from the total number of passengers handled duringAthe Winter , and " with that 80 per cent . passenger traffic this company is running more seats past the peak point ( rush hours ) of observation that there are passengers .

He maintained that the 331-3 per cent . increase in service over last year was more than sufficient to handle the 5 per cent . increase in the volume of traffic over last year .

" The plea of the Interborough for permission to reduce its service for a period of eleven months is based , also , according to Mr. Keegan. on a shortage of shop facilities which prevents the cornpan ? from keeping pace with repair work . The Company 's Check . Mr. Keegan explained that in anticipation of the hearing the subway officials had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading conditions on trains during the non-rush hour .
