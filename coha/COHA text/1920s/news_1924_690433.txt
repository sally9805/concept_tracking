txt Employer Declares Reserve Officer Quit Before Leaving for Plattsburg . SAYS HE SOUGHT NEW JOB Statement From E. S. Lott Replies to Charge Made in " Price of Patriotism " Sermon . Edson S. Lott , President of the United States Casualty Company , SO Maiden Lane , . issued a statement yesterday about the case of Francis A. Brown , a Lieutenant in the Army Reserve Corps , who was in the employ of that company until he went recently to the training camp at Plattsburg and there received a letter announcing  --  his , dismissal . Mr. Lott denied that Brown had been discharged because he went to the camp for training . He said that Brown resigned when he was unable to get a substitute to perform his work for him or to arrange a change in vacation periods with a. colleague so that he could attend the camp . He added that Brown would not be taken back by the company . Brown 's case became known as a result of a sermon preached at Plattsburg on Sunday by the Rev. William Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting chaplain of the , 305th Infantry . Brown also lives in Brooklyn and is at present at Plattsburg . While his name was not mentioned by the chaplain it was soon learned that it was his case that the clergycnan referred to In his sermon entitled " The Price of Patriotism . " In that sermon Mr. Carter asserted that a reserve officer had lost his position as a result of attending the camp . Explains Company 's Action . When the news was published in New York on Monday , Mr. Lott was at his country place at New City , N. Y. , and no statement was issued in his absence . Yesterday , upon his return , Mr. Lott gave out the following : " Our vacations are necessarily fixed early in each year . Mr. Brown 's only original objection to the time allotted him was that it included the Fourth of July . Later he asked that his vacation period be changed . Assistant Secretary Hunt . who has charge of Mr. Brown 's work , told him that this would be agreeable if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation periods with him . This Mr. Brown could not arrange . He said nothing more about it , but left for his vacation , ending July 12 . On that date Mr. Brown came to Mr. Hunt and told him that he was going to the training camp for the following two weeks . Mr. Hunt 's letter to Mr. Brown followed . " It may be mentioned that service at the training camp is wholly voluntary ( see . Special Regulation 43 ) , that Mr. Brown 's work had to do with workmen 's compensation insurance and that an interruption of that work would lead to delayed payments to injured workmen and their dependents .. T may also say that Mr. Brown had full knowledge of the conditions and of the probable consequences . He tyrned in his office key , and made at least two efforts about which we know to land another position just before leaving for camp . On his Part it seemed to be a voluntary giving up of his position : on ours , an effort to keep at least a semblance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way to meet our responsibilities . " Every official and employe of this company , so far as I know , is in favor of that which the Government is attempting to do at Plattsburg . " Thirty-seven employes of this company went to war . In each case . when they came back , they were given their old positions with such increases in salaries as they might reasonably have expected had they not been absent , and in some cases we otherwise helped them financially . " Mr. Hunt states specifically that he said not a word to Mr. Brown or to any one else which could be construed into anything but praise for the training camp . " In Sympathy With Camps . Supplementing this statement Mr. Lott said that the policS- of tile company was entirely in sympathy with the military training camps . " It is the first case of its kind In which we have experienced any difficulty . There are others here ho are members of the Officers ' Reserve Corps . Some have gone to training camps during their vacations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vacation periods . " Mr. Brown 's assertion that the first he knew about the change was while he was at camp is misleading . The fact of the matter is that he knew this orally before he went to camp and the letter was sent as a matter of record . He was dissatisfied with his position here , sought another , left us and will not be taken back . "
