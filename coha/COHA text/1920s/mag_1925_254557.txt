Vanities . Two years ago , Earl Carroll started this series off with Peggy Hopkins Joyce , Joe Cook and a lot of vaudeville actors . He had a good show . <P> Last year , he had Mr. Cook and vaudeville actors-fair show . This year he has only the vaudeville actors and the show is a dire display . <P> On the opening night , it commenced at eight and ran till morning hours . The following night , he had chipped out an hour or more of the worst proceedings . The remainder was still pretty stupid . Mr. Carroll will juggle the piece for about a month in an effort to make it salable . By then it may be fair . <P> He has strained for novelty . There are no footlights . The stage comes graded down to a half moon of front-row tables . These are ostensibly sold to patrons at $11.00 a seat . Ginger ale is served . Off to the left where the boxes were sits a jazz band-not an orchestra . The chorus spends a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during the intermission , the audience dances on the stage . <P> Julius Tannen , Ted and Betty Healy , Bobby Folsom are reported to be headliners in vaudeville-Mr . Tannen has occasionally assisted other revues . None seem to matter much . The chorus is only mildly exhilarating , the scenery slipshod . A tune or two stands out . <P> All Wet . Weary reviewers approached this one cautiously . After pawing it a bit with their pens , they passed on , rejoicing that they had seen the last play until the August rush begins . Last of the season , and one of the least . <P> It was a farce . No producer would risk it , so the actors gave it themselves . Three married couples and a butler set out to nationalize women in Yonkers . One of the couples is just leaving home after quarrels ; one is just arriving after an elopement . Opposed to the butler 's Soviet theories is a heaving sea captain with a notion to hammer anyone mistreating a woman . All this loudly played , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Once more the patriarch of song and dancing has operated on his current show . New blood for its failing veins he has purchased , new cooling costumes for the chorus , new backgrounds , new tunes . Since this year 's Follies was one of the smartest ever staged , these changes seemed scarcely necessary . They advance the show 's excellence sufficiently to make it worth while on second visit . <P> W. C. Fields , Will Rogers , Ray Dooley , Olsen 's Band , Vivienne Segal remain . Added are Edna Leedom , Lina Basquette and various ladies fair .
