The last message of Calvin Coolidge to the U. S. Congress proved to be a brief and unmomentous document . It began , of course , on Peace and Prosperity . It announced that , thanks to prudent budget pruning , the Treasury might have a surplus of 37 millions this year instead of the 94-million deficit rumored before the election . Let Congress beware of the " unthinkable disgrace " of unbalancing the budget between now and June 30 , it said . <P> The message touched conventionally on foreign relations , taking the Senate 's ratification of the Kellogg treaty for granted . Again the cruiser bill was urged ( " I wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic " ) . Farm relief was urged-a revolving loan fund to help market surpluses ; more research work , especially by the States . The Coolidge desires to see more railroad mergers and to get the government entirely out of the shipping business were re-expressed . There were flat pronouncements for building the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by-product " as private enterprise can very well fill this field . " Again let the Muscle Shoals power and nitrate plants be leased , urged the President . <P> Prohibition was reserved for a closing paragraph . President Coolidge called upon all states and " all our inhabitants " to help federal enforcement . <P> Finally there was a Conclusion-a sort of preliminary farewell to the U.S. people from Calvin Coolidge ( who will make at least one more Last Speech at the Hoover inauguration ) . Said he of peace and prosperity : " . . . Having reached this position , we should not fail to comprehend that it can be easily lost . It needs more effort for its support than the less exalted places of the world . . . . Peace and prosperity are not finalities ; they are only methods . It is too easy under their influence for a nation to become selfish and degenerate . This test has come to the United States . .                  @ @ @
