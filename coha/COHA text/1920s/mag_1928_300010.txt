There was something impressive about the return of Calvin Coolidge , sunburned and filled out after three months on a small Wisconsin river , to a Washington full of national politics and governmental odds and ends . He gave the politics some attention . He issued some orders in connection with the Budget Bureau 's forecast of a $94,000,000 deficit , chief of the odds and ends . But the sphere to which he chiefly applied himself was the grand one of International Relations . It was as if he felt he had conquered his own nation politically and economically and was now , in his last few months in office , ready to engage the world , diplomatically ; ready to take his place as a world statesman . The Hoover campaign and the Deficit would take care of themselves , his attitude seemed to say . The Pact of Paris , the Anglo-French naval agreement , readjustment of Reparations-with such matters was the Coolidge Era to be concerned at its close . <P> President Coolidge , his first day back , talked with his Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few perfunctory moments and Nominee Hoover about a half-hour . The Pact of Paris ( renouncing war as an instrument of national policy ) was signed and in the State safe . It must now be ratified by the Senate . Ratification would be opposed by friends of the cruiser-building bill , which was shelved last spring , until that bill 's passage was assured How would the bill be affected by the semisecret agreement between England and France to restrict their armaments of large submarines and large cruisers ? President Coolidge reassured the U. S. Navy 's friends that any naval reductions France and England might agree on between themselves would be applauded by the U. S. but would have no effect on U. S. naval policy . After seeing the President , Secretary Wilbur of the Navy felt free to say : " We have not changed our naval program . " <P> To Zogu I , new-crowned King of Albania , this cable was despatched . " It is with pleasure that I extend to your Majesty and to the people of Albania congratulations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people join with me in expressing best wishes for your Majesty 's good health and happiness and for the prosperity of Albania-CALVIN COOLIDGE . " <P> President Coolidge announced that no matter what anyone may say he is going to do after March 4 , " it is wrong . " <P> President Coolidge appointed Col. Harry Burgess . U. S. Engineers , to succeed Brig. - Gen . Meriwether L. Walker as Governor of the Panama Canal Zone . <P> President Coolidge scanned Red Cross reports on the Porto Rico-Florida hurricane ( see p. n ) , and sent orders for the Army , Navy and Coast Guard to give help . <P> President Coolidge proclaimed Fire Prevention Week Oct. 7 to 13.
