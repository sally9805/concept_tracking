Dun 's Review has published some illuminating statistics on the current boom in construction . New building permits filed last March call for the expenditure of $318,926,000 , compared with $248 million in the month preceding , $189 million in January , 1924 , and $292 million in March , 1923 . <P> Most of the leading centres of population show larger amounts this March than for the same month last year ; leading examples are Boston , Buffalo , Pittsburgh , Baltimore , Greater New York , Memphis , Dallas , Cleveland , Detroit , Milwaukee and practically all the Pacific Coast cities . Yet many large cities , notably Chicago , Cincinnati , Philadelphia , St. Louis , Indianapolis and smaller Western and Southern centres , show a decrease compared to 1923.
