In his father 's house are many mansions , and it is from the windows of one of them that he stands looking out upon the clock-work of the skies . With the precision that is possible only to things dead in themselves , the stars weave incessantly their interlocking measures . At intervals the blackest pockets of space give birth to a nebula , whirling in new anguish , but for the most part the sky offers only its vast stars , eased in the first gradations of their cooling , and fulfilling happily and with a faint humming sound the long loops of their appointment . To him comes Gabriel . GABRIEL There are some unusually urgent petitions here ... There 's this colonel on a raft in the Bengal Sea .  - -  Here again is the widow and her two daughters in Moscow . A lady in Rome . ( He lays some papers on the table ) Besides , there is someone outside who wishes to speak to you . He says he knew you on earth . I think he has something to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . ( There is a loud rapping at the door . ) GABRIEL There is again . OUR LORD Then let him in . ( Gabriel admits Malchus and goes out . ) MALCHUS Please , sir , excuse me being so hasty , but I had to speak to you about something . p. 3 OUR LORD You are displeased with Heaven ? MALCHUS Oh no , sir -- except for one thing . OUR LORD We will talk about it in a minute . Come by the window and look . Can you tell me which of those stars is mine ? MALCHUS Lord , all are yours , surely . OUR LORD No , only one is mine , for only one bears living things upon it . And where there is no life I have no power . All the stars save one are lifeless ; not even a blade of grass pushes through their powder or their flame . but one of them is so crowded with event that Heaven itself is scarcely able to attend its need.  - -  But you are not interested ? MALCHUS Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there that I can not be expected to ... Even my children 's children have long since left it . I can not be very interested . Since I am so happy here -- except for one thing . But I should like to see it again . Which is it sir ? OUR LORD There , see ! See where it floats for a moment out of a green mist . If your ears were accustomed to it as mine are , you would hear what I hear : the sigh as it turns . Now , what it is you want of me ? MALCHUS Well , as you know , I was the High Priest 's sevant in the garden when you were taken . Sir , it 's hardly worth mentioning . p. 4 OUR LORD No , no . Speak out . MALCHUS And one of your fellows took out his sword and cut off my ear . OUR LORD Yes . MALCHUS It 's ... hardly worth mentioning . Most of the time , Lord , we 're very happy up here and nothing disturbs our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are aware of it , pleasantly or unpleasantly . A sort of something crosses our mind . And because I 'm in your book someone is always reading about me and thinking about me for a moment , and in the middle of my games I feel it . Especially at this season , when your death is celebrated , no moment goes by without this happening . And what they think is , that I 'm ridiculous . OUR LORD I see . And you want your name to be erased from the book ? MALCHUS ( Eagerly ) Yes , sir . I thought you could just make the pages become blank at that place . OUR LORD Now that you have come here everything that you wish is granted to you . You know that . MALCHUS Yes sir ; thank you , sir . OUR LORD But stay a minute . At this season , Malchus , a number of people are thinking of me , too . MALCHUS Yes Lord , but as good , as great ... p. 5 OUR LORD But Malchus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! OUR LORD Ridiculous because I suffered from the delusion that after my death I could be useful to men . MALCHUS They do n't say that ! OUR LORD And that my mind lay under a malady that many a doctor could cure . And that I have deceived and cheated millions and millions of souls who in their extremity called on me for the aid I had promised . They did not know that I died like any other man and their prayers mounted into vain air , for I no longer exist . My promises were so vast that I am either divine or ridiculous . ( Pause ) Malchus , will you stay and be ridiculous with me ? MALCHUS Yes , sir , I 'll stay . I 'm glad to stay . Though in a way I have n't any right to be there . I was n't even the High Priest 's servant ; I only held his horse every now and then . And and I used to steal a little -- only you 've forgiven me that . Sure , I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MALCHUS ( Smiling ) It is n't even true in the book . It was my left ear and not my right . OUR LORD Yes , the book is n't always true about me , either . p. 6 MALCHUS Excuse my troubling you , sir . Good day . OUR LORD Good day , Malchus . ( Malchus goes out . Gabriel enters discreetly and lays down some more papers . ) GABRIEL ( In a low voice )
