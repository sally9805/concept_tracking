When John William Davis was chosen by the Democratic Convention on the ninth day of balloting , he issued a formal announcement . In <P> he spoke , with seeming understatement , of " the resolution and endurance ... the supreme vitality " of the delegates , and of their " deliberate and unanimous choice . " It was a touching tribute . <P> McAdoo Withdraws . For eight days , a mountain of a Convention-1,098 men and as many assistants-labored and brought forth not even a mouse . In the travail ot the eighth night , William G. McAdoo and his supporters were watching in the Madison Square Hotel , close to the " Garden " . There they sat while a last effort was made to send McAdoo over the top . On the 96th ballot he reached 421 votes more than 100 short of his high mark of 530 achieved three nights earlier , and his advisers shook their heads . Bernard M. Baruch and Thomas L. Chadbourne Jr . were in the group . Mr. McAdoo was almost groggy from lack of sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers asked him to quit for the Party 's sake . He was very weary-very . He sent word recalling his floorleaders from the Convention Hall . Judge David Ladd Rockwell and J. Bruce Kremer came hurrying . He told them that he was going to quit . He stayed by his decision . <P> Slowly , wearily , a letter was drafted . He would not withdraw his name . He would merely free his followers to vote as they saw fit . At 3.00 a. m. the letter was read in the Wall amid great emotion . In two ballots , McAdoo dropped from 406 to 190 . The Convention then called it " a night . " <P> Nominated . The Convention had its job still ahead . The next noon , resolutely enduring , with supreme vitality , it became deliberately unanimous after three ballots . When McAdoo fell , Smith followed . Most of the favorite sons failed to come forward at the crucial moment . The field on the final day was led by new leaders . First , Davis ; second , Underwood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the lead . Like a boat which heels over and shifts her cargo , the further she tips the faster she goes . Davis : 839 votes on the 103rd ballot ; then unanimous by acclamation . <P> After a brief recess the Convention resumed . Senator Walsh came within an ace of being nominated for Vice President . Like the Republican , Frank O. Lowden , Senator Walsh had written his regrets in advance ; so the Democrats , less incredulous than the Republicans , took his word for it . <P> In the course of the speechmaking 13 men were placed in nomination for the Vice Presidential place . <P> During a long evening of nominating speeches there were two bright spots . One was when Alfred E. Smith appeared and told what an extraordinary Governor he had been to New York . <P> Davis ' Speech . The second bright spot was when the nominee himself appeared . His speech was brief-an effort to reknit the wounds of nine days ' battle and to obliterate the antagonisms aroused :         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
