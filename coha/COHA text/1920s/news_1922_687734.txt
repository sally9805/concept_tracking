Some had started before that date , and others climbed still higher for several months , but May , 1920 , was the month when the general descent began , and it was not until a year later that a breath-catching period was reached . A comparison of the wholesale price index for that month with those of the past three will show , not only how far prices have fallen , but that th.y are coming to a common resting place , some climbing up and others slowly moving down to meet them .
