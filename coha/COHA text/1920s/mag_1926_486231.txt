A bag pudding the King did make , And stuffed it well with plums , And in it put great lumps of fat As big as my two thumbs . T HERE were kings in those days . In our time kings no longer make plum-puddings . Perhaps that is why they are losing their thrones . But though royalty does not now mix bag puddings , that modern king of kings , the restaurant chef , does it on a larger scale than ever . A press dispatch from London , the capital of puddingdom , tells us that the chef of the Savoy opened the plum-pudding season some weeks ago and by early November had already made 2,000 pounds of this delectable dish for consumption in the United States  --  not to speak of keeping the home puddings boiling . The dispatch continues : No ritual could be more impressive to the epicure than to see Mr. Latry mix his first plum-pudding of the season . For thirty years he has assembled his assistants about him on a date fixed several weeks before Christmas . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some quaint religious ceremony , he has poured the first bottle of brandy into the pudding mixture . A diminutive page-boy always makes the first stir . When one reads a description like that one gets an inkling of the solidity of Great Britain . Plum-pudding , under the flag upon which the sun never sets , is not merely a food ; it is a British institution . It may almost be called the British institution . Indeed it is probably the reason why the British have a flag that the sun never sets on and that others rarely sit on . Christmas pudding , they like to call it in England , although the term should be reserved for an unusually rich and mellow one , specially destined for the holiday season . " Mix your puddings several weeks in advance , " advises the chef of the Savoy , " and let the flavor improve . " Several weeks ? That would never have done in the good old days when King Arthur did the cooking . In less opportunist times than ours the open season for plum-pudding-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the product was preserved for the holiday season of the year thereafter , for its contents were such that it could be depended upon to carry out the principles of Dr. Cone ; every day and in every way it grew better and better . In fact , a tip-top plum-pudding is so good that it is as excellent cold as hot . That it is often eaten that way is recalled by the story of the family butler who asked his mistress solicitously : " Will you heat your pudding cold or shall I ' eat it for you ? " We Americans have never got anywhere with pudding ; neither in the making nor the eating of it . Pie is our national dish , and it is fit and proper that it should have no serious rival in our affections . In the direction of puddings we have a few weak sisters : rice , bread , tapioca , cabinet . They are baked puddings and as such are not really puddings at all . They are fluffy , unsubstantial confections which digest in two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish for heroes and strong men . It is not baked but boiled in a bag like King Arthur 's ; and it does n't leave you with an empty feeling a few hours after eating . It has a staying quality which has passed from it into the English people ; it grapples the inside of the stomach and goes with you for the rest of the day . The national wealth of Great Britain must go into Christmas puddings if one may judge by the Savoy recipe : Twelve ounces Malaga raisins , 12 ounces currants , 12 ounces suet , 9 ounces flour , 4 ounces chopped apple , 1 ounce orange peel , 8 ounces brown sugar , half pint milk , 12 ounces Smyrna raisins , 12 ounces crystallized peel , 10 ounces bread crumbs , 1 ounce ginger , 1 ounce citron peel , 1 teaspoonful salt , 6 eggs , quarter of a pint of brandy or sherry . All the dry ingredients should be well mixed together . A little extra mixing well repays the trouble . Beat the eggs and add them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again mix thoroughly . Pack into greased molds and boil for six hours at the time of making . The puddings should be boiled for a further six hours when wanted for use . The best sauces are white , custard , or brandy sauce . We do not make many puddings like that  --  fortunately , perhaps , because this is no country in which to eat them . When a true Christmas pudding does get itself made among us it serves chiefly as a table ornament . Nobody eats more than a bite or two  --  again fortunately . For America , although a land of many blessings , has not a climate adapted to bold eating . It lacks the stimulus of those cold , penetrating fogs , of that moisture-laden , marrow-piercing air . In our earlier outdoor days we were fair-to-middling eaters , but latterly there are everywhere signs of decay : consomm  --  s , salads , custards , and such flubdubbery . Any American who has ever tried to eat his way through a day with an Englishman on his home grounds has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank heaven , the English have a reasonable breakfast hour ) with porridge , followed by finnan haddie or other salt fish , which leads up to a bountiful plate of bacon and eggs , a pot of tea , and a generous portion of toast and marmalade with which to top off . The middle of the day calls for a light soup ( say , pur  --  e of split pea ) , an evanescent mutton chop ( two inches thick ) , a bursting potato , and a vegetable trifle like boiled cabbage . When this has been washed down with a pint of bitter one has laid a fitting foundation . He may dam up the rest of his stomach with plum-pudding , confident of some permanency in an otherwise mutable and dissolving universe . But at four o'clock one puts one 's legs under the table again for tea , toasted scones , and a few trivial slices of plum cake  --  presumably designed to clamp the pudding down . What an Englishman eats after that no American has ever found out , because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , puddings are not for Americans , but they are the mainstay and the standby of every Briton-born . If not his first thought , they are at least his last , as evidenced by the dialogue in an East End fried-fish shop : " Gim me some fried fish . " " Hot or cold ? " " Hot . " " Eat it here or take it with yer ? " " Eat it here . " " Fork or fingers ? " " Aw in disgust , gim me puddin' ' . " Some folks think it 's patriotism that has made Great Britain great . Tommyrot ! It 's puddin' ' . Calvin Coolidge , Socialist T HAT was such a sensational message which President Coolidge sent to Congress on December 7 that the New York Times placed over it the thrilling and unexpected heading , " PRESIDENT URGES CAUTION ON CONGRESS . " Superficially it is a cheerful Christmas message for all of our citizens  --  but only superficially . True , in reporting on the state of the Union he found it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperity . " To this he added , with his delicate sense of what is new and startling : " In some quarters our diplomacy is vexed with difficult and as yet unsolved problems , but nowhere are we met with armed conflict . " With this assurance to his readers that we have no private war going on under cover unknown to the public , he launched into a panegyric on economy : " Nothing is more destructive of the progress of the nation than government extravagance . " But this is not the most striking part of Mr. Coolidge 's message , nor is the early keynote which reads thus : " What the country requires is not so much new policies as a steady continuation of those which are already being crowned with such abundant success . " He sagely advises that it would " be greatly for the welfare of the country if we avoided at the present session all commitments except those of the most pressing nature . From a reduction of the debt and taxes will accrue a wider benefit to all the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " However , he would have " a balanced portion of the surplus revenue " applied not to the reduction of the debt but to the reduction of taxation . Nevertheless , he favors " a speedy reduction of the debt as already required by law and in accordance with the promises made to the holders of our Liberty bonds " ; but he also sees no reason why we should not come to the relief of the taxpayers by " making reductions in the income-tax payments which accrue on the 15th of March and June , 1927 . " These are his " convictions stated with full knowledge that it is for the Congress to decide whether they judge it best to make such a reduction or leave the surplus for the present year to be applied to retirement of the war debt . " Having thus clearly and succinctly stated his opinions , Congress will , of course , know just how to act . We confess to an uneasy feeling that the President , who has till now been rated as a very Gibraltar of conservatism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With alarm we find his keynote to be advocacy of a socialistic dealing with the cotton situation , urging that 4,000,000 bales of cotton be purchased and withheld from the market , thus interfering with the normal functioning of the great law of supply and demand , which is the very heart of private business . More than that , he urges " a reduction of about one-third in the cotton acreage in the coming year . " The virus has , however , affected him even more deeply than this . We find him urging the lowering of all the freight rates of all the railroads for the benefit of all the farmers , demanding further consolidation of the railroads , and , most sinister of all , praising the Government Inland Waterways Corporation under which the government operates boats on 2,500 miles of navigable streams , a violent government plunge into private business . At point after point he wishes to put the government into private business ; he wants to broaden and strengthen federal credit agencies which compete with private banks ; he wishes to throw open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he calls for the development of those cooperative associations , which some of our leading business men declare to be a step toward communistic marketing ; he urges a legislative interference with the private bituminous ' coal industry by Congress in that he asks for the passage of legislation to enable him to interfere in any struggle between employers and employees , and in time of trouble to distribute coal and to fix the price of coal for the consumer . Next , he insists that the government rigidly supervise and control the private radio business by a radio board and the Department of Commerce . Nor are these urgings that the government compete with private enterprise to be offset by the declaration that he is " in favor of reducing rather than expanding government bureaus which seek to regulate and control the business activities of the people . " When he declares the next moment for a stricter enforcement ' of the prohibition amendment , advocates the extension of the Mississippi River transportation system , and refrains from urging the immediate transfer of our government-owned merchant marine to private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subtle influences which , as the Daughters of the Revolution and the American Legion so well know , strike directly at our fundamental liberties . What will these patriots do about it ? We tremble as we await their decision . Claude Monet , 1840-1926 T HE death of Claude Monet is in a sense the death of impressionism itself . The thousands of impressionist pictures that are being turned out now , and that are likely to be turned out for generations to come , are at best the work of epigoni , at worst the result of a lifeless formula with slight relation to the life of our time . The impressionists were a typical product of their experimental , individualist epoch . Nineteenth-century France , oscillating between revolution and reaction , republic and empire , ' civil and foreign war , witnessed a parallel oscillation in its cultural life . In art the classic and romantic , the realist , naturalist , and impressionist schools followed in rapid succession , each in its turn envisaging new aims ; adopting new methods , accomplishing new triumphs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which placed nineteenth-century France in the forefront of Europe . Other schools may have exercised a wider influence than impressionism ; few have provoked more acrimonious controversy . Impressionist exhibitions were signals to battle in which every statute in the code of literary etiquette was violated . But the ferocious onslaughts of its enemies were more than matched by the passionate defense of its friends , Duret , Huysmans , Zola , Mirbeau , Mauclair , who in the end forced the recognition and acceptance of the new doctrine . Of this movement Monet was the most consistent protagonist . It was one of his own canvases exhibited in 1874 which gave the name to the movement ; and since the age of sixteen , when Monet exhibited for the first time , and for almost seventy years thereafter , his work and person illustrated the halting beginning , the gradual development , and the culminating perfection of the entire impressionist school . Impressionism sought to grip and stay the momentary impressions of things , men , and events , to render concrete and permanent the fleeting , changing aspects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tout est a peindre . " Crooked alleys and spacious boulevards , rickety shanties and magnificent cathedrals , the race track , the bar room , the dance hall  --  all the variegated modernity , crossed at certain points by traces of the medieval and ancient epochs , entered the impressionist 's angle of vision . Monet himself painted still-lifes , genre pictures , portraits , but it was light playing on field , sky , and water which formed the true subject of his most characteristic pictures . The commonly accepted practice among artists to divide the march of seasons and the passage of hours into summer , winter , spring , and fall , and morning , evening , day , and night , is arbitrary and artificial . There are numberless gradations within these divisions ; every hour of the day is different from every other hour of the same day . The world is to the impressionist a stream of unique sense-impressions seen once and never to be repeated . Accordingly , Monet painted his haystacks , water lilies , poplars , cathedrals . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old methods . While some influences may be traced in part to Japanese art , and to Constable and Delacroix , more important still were the scientific discoveries of Chevreul and Rood . Color was raised to a higher pitch and greater variety by concentrating light upon it . A more vigorous brushwork was practiced and the new technique of point/Wiz/7w was developed , in which spectral colors were used without being mixed on the palette but placed in small dots and in complementary juxtaposition direct on canvas , where , seen from a certain distance , they blend , giving the desired hue with great brilliance . Even the shadows were made aglow with color and vibration . His eyesight failing and his general health weakened , l'arvn a+ no a aari his la a+ van re a+ flivarriv T-Ta " kind iivpfi inn fy enough to see the triumph of the principles for which he fought . Impressionism , which began as a rebellion against the academy , ironically enough was later sanctified in academic circles and even used as a club against the newer tendencies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more tolerant toward these newer tendencies ; and , remembering perhaps his own early struggles , he had even words of praise for their " esprit de bataille et de decouverte . " Friar Bacon T a memorial meeting in honor of the late Professor Newbolt of the University of Pennsylvania two members of the Department of Chemistry at that institution announced the performance of an odd experiment . Working upon a hitherto unknown formula recorded in cipher by Roger Bacon , they succeeded in producing a certain salt of copper , and , though the cumbersome formula is useless , the result of the experiment is to vindicate Professor New-bolt 's reading of a strange manuscript and to remind the public again of one of the most remarkable adventures of modern paleography . About fourteen years ago a well-known dealer brought to this country , a fascinating- vellum volume of which the documentary history could not be traced farther back than 1665 , but which appeared to be an original production of Roger Bacon . Adorned with various drawings of cell development and other microscopic details of plant structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alchemy , it was eagerly scanned by scholars on account of the half-historical , half-legendary position of its authoras a man centuries in advance of the scientific knowledge of his contemporaries and possessed of secrets not known to others until they were rediscovered centuries later . The text of the work was mere gibberish , but , since Bacon was reputed to have concealed much of his knowledge rather than increase an already dangerous reputation as a magician , a cipher was suspected . Various experts failed , however , to make anything out of it until Mr. Newbolt announced before a meeting of the American Philosophical Society in 1921 that he had found the key . Under a lens each letter was seen to be composed of a number of separate strokes , and these strokes were the symbols used in a known system of Greek shorthand . Pursuing this discovery Mr. Newbolt was able to decipher considerable portions of the text and , to his amazement , brought to light records of historical events , astrological observations , and bits of philosophical and scientific theory which had doubtless been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . In the opinion of some , the manuscript demonstrated his knowledge of the compound microscope , and certainly he had observed certain details of living organisms not again noted for four hundred years , until the days of Leeuwenhoek and Hamm . Unfortunately , however , the cipher was not completely unambiguous . It seemed to allow considerable latitude for the exercise of ingenuity in interpretation , and there were some , not wholly convinced , who argued that perhaps Mr. Newbolt , though perfectly sincere , was reading into the mysterious symbols the contents of his own unconscious mind , so that he died without having won entire acceptance for his reading . Now , however , the experiment at Penng3r1vania seems +n b VILL nvcrdicirl fbta Vse.o.1-the result is both to vindicate Mr. Newbolt and to add support to the long-enduring legend of Friar Bacon . Not only will it awaken the keenest interest of all serious medievalists and doubtless stimulate someone to complete Mr. New-bolt 's translation but it will come as a comfort also to those of romantic disposition whom it pleases to see picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , for the fame of the friar has been sadly dimmed of late . In the days of Shakespeare every street urchin had heard of the wonderful brazen head which he was supposed to have made speak and many had seen him appear as a sort of Faustus upon the contemporary stage ; today not everybody can distinguish him very clearly from " the author of Shakespeare 's plays " and his legend has not escaped the destructive criticism of scholars . In his monumental " History of Magic and ' Experimental Science During the First Thirteen Centuries of Our Era " Lynn Thorndike not only questions the old story of his persecution by the church but attempts as well to prune of its extravagances the legend of his almost superhuman wisdom , stoutly maintaining that Bacon was more conspicuously a man of his age than one who transcended it . Now , however , the remarkable cipher throws a new glamor about his name : he was engaged in making actual , detailed , scientific observations , and for some reason , real ar fanciful , he did think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion . For once then , minute investigation comes to the rescue of romance , and we are at liberty again to fancy the friar , solitary in the cold cell of his cloister , penetrating secrets which were to be his alone for centuries , one more example of A mind forever Voyaging through strange seas of thought , alone .
