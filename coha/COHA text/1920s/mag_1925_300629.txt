The French Parliament reassembled after the New Year 's vacation . Premier Herriot was in his place on the Government bench . It was his first public appearance since his illness ( TIME , Dec. 22 , et seq. ) , and he attended the session , as he said , to prove his protesting doctors false prophets . To his friends , he said that he was feeling perfectly able to stand the strain of debate . <P> Ex-Premier Paul Painlev was re-elected President of the Chamber of Deputies by 313 votes to 25 . The Right Opposition abstained from voting . <P> In the Senate , M. Justin de Selves was re-elected President of that august body . His poll was 30 votes larger than it was when he was elected last July . This was taken as a sign that the Senate was becoming pro-Nationalist and therefore antiGovernment , which augurs ill for Premier Herriot M. de Selves received 167 votes . M. Bienvenu-Martin , Socialist , was the opposing candidate with 116 votes . <P> Chamber President Painlev had hardly finished his inaugural address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in his presidential capacity , than a first-class uproar broke out . The Government consented to listen to an interpellation on the sardine-packers ' strike in Brittany , but the Right Opposition objected and showed their antipathy by banging their disk-lids and shouting . The Left Opposition tried to shout down their opponents across the Chamber and in the ear-splitting din which resulted , Chamber President Painlev was seen to rise , a pained expression on his face , put on his hat and depart , thereby signifying that the session was at an end . At this moment , several Communists rushed the Nationalist benches and a free fight began , to be ended a half an hour later by the brutal intervention of a dozen lusty sergeants-at-arms , the Chamber 's chuckers-out . <P> Next day , it was charged that a certain Deputy had thrown a glass at the head of a brother Deputy who had insulted him . Several Deputies thereupon undertook to draft a measure providing for the punishment of any members committing an act of violence during a session . <P> Premier Herriot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Government was adamantly opposed to a policy of currency inflation : " It is not our fault that during this year the country will have to meet enormous bills . But whoever is to blame , and whatever the consequences of our decision , this Government is formally determined there shall be no inflation . However desperate may be the measure we may be forced to take , and even should personal interest be shaken , there will be no inflation . It is only in that way we can do our duty toward the future as did those who in the War gave up their lives for it . " <P> The Premier 's declaration received the unanimous support of the Chamber ( Communists excepted ) . Deputy Marcelle responded : " However great the personal sacrifices which may be involved , and however harsh the consequences for many , the Opposition heartily associates itself with the courageous words of the Premier . " <P> Finance Minister Etienne Clementel , backing his Chief , expounded that " it would be a crime to have recourse now to the printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves free from the present situation is by economy and sincerity . "
