He happened to get caught in a street crowd . Everybody but himself was hissing to the top of his hiss . In candid ignorance and good faith he asked a , Frenchman at his side what he was hissing at . " At those American tourists on that bus . " " What for ? " asked the puzzled Oxonian . The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't know . " " That , " says the now returned traveler , %was typical of the crowd . " Very likely . Some mischief-maker starts a demonstration . The idlers join in it , if not from sympathy , from imitation or infection .

Students are always conspuing their professors or some Minister . Communists , royalists and other factions are always getting up manifestations . Toughs are always ready to bait those patient " cows " the police . Idlers like to see the " fun . " Often it goes too far , either by design or the instinctive cruelty of crowds .

The Deputy Returning Officer testified that he had put the extra ballots in the box and that W. T. CROOK , the clerk , had , written seventyfour names down in the poll book . The two men " went fifty-fifty in the decision to stuff the ballot boxes . " The reason was that " if the poll made a good showing , it would be thought there was a fair population in the district . " The Frog Lake poll was not so inflated , but a score or more names were voted on , FRED Bowrate , " an old resident , " explained that he had suggested the stuffing because " if we showed enough votes , we should get more roads and bridges .

For years studies have been made of the similarities between the tribes on both sides of Bering Strait , showing either common intercourse or a common origin . The lay mind , always so ready to give advice to experts rather than to receive it from them , does not understand why , more studies are not made of the-Indians of South An:taloa with a view to throwing light on their Asiatic origin . The opportunities for intercommunication between the peoples of the two continents near Bering Strait are so many that similarities are sure to be more striking there than elsewhere . The Asiatic origin theory implies a land bridge or more highly developed boats than have yet been discovered among the aborigines .

It has been pointed out by Mr. Gn. - BERT H. MONTAGUE that there is nothing in the ruling of the commission to prevent calling the wood by any simple , non-technical name , provided it does not deceive the buying public . Through an inquiry addressed to consumers from the Atlantic to the Pacific it was discovered that an overwhelming majority believed that " Philippine mahogany " meant some kind of real mahogany . Since the courts have held that the public 's understanding of a term is-the only legal criterion , it became necessary to order a change to some name which would deceivt , no one . A number of curious cases have been considered by the commission . " Rayon " for artificial silk has been approved : " Irish lace " was thought by most people to be lace manufactured in Ireland .
