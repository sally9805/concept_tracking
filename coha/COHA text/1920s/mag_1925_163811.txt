With Chancellor Luther and Foreign Minister Stresemann in the Distinguished Visitors ' Gallery of the House of Commons , noted Scotch Laborite Arthur Henderson* created a sensation by demanding to be told once and for all whether the dead bodies of German soldiers were ever " boiled down " by their comrades in " corpse factories " during the War , or whether the story ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) was faked British propaganda , as was recently hinted in Manhattan by General Charteris ( head of the British Army Intelligence Service during the War ) . <P> Amid an awkward pause , Dr. Luther and Herr Stresemann arose and quitted the gallery . A few minutes later Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain appeared and smoothed matters over as follows : <P> " The Chancellor of Germany has authorized me to say on the authority of the German Government that there was never any foundation for the corpse factory story . On behalf of the British Government I accept this denial and trust this false report will not be again revived . " <P> A modicum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Secretary for the Admiralty , announced in the House that 37 antiquated British warships are shortly to be junked for what they will bring . Included in the list are 18 destroyers , 7 submarines , 3 cruisers , 1 " drifter " ( fishing boat taken over during the War and employed as naval trawler ) . <P> Sir Samuel J. G. Hoare , Secretary of State for Air , told the House that 9 squadrons of airplanes ( averaging 12 planes each ) are now maintained permanently with the fleet , 27 squadrons are in readi- ness in England , and 18 squadrons are stationed in the colonies and elsewhere . <P> A Labor resolution censuring the Government for its part in the recent jailing of 12 noted Communists ( TIME , Dec. 7 ) was voted down by the House 351 to 122 . During the debate former Labor Premier Macdonald cried : " These 12 men were put in prison after a trial conducted like a general election . . . after a most improper whoop . " The Home Secretary , Sir William Joynson-Hicks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less pugnaciously than is his wont . He remarked : " My attention haying been called to these Communists , their activities were merely referred to the Attorney General . " Attorney General Douglas Hogg then rose and " accepted full responsibility " for the prosecution . <P> Late in the week , at 4:30 a. m . Mr. Neil McLean , Clydeside Laborite fire-eater , attempted to delay debate in the Commons by in- terjecting a motion calling for a secret session of the House-the first since the War period . Adroit , the Tories refused to heckle over the point , passed the motion in a flash , effectively cut Mr. McLean off from the public audience which he delights to entertain . <P> *Onetime day laborer , total abstainer , Home Secretary in the Maddonald cabinet .
