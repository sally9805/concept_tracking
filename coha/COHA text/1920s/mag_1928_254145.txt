Governor Ralph O. Brewster of Maine made the error several years ago of seeming friendly to the Ku Klux Klan . The Klan is now dead in Maine , as elsewhere , but the smudge of pitch lasts long . Governor Brewster tried to oust U. S. Senator Frederick Hale in Maine 's Republican primary last week . He reminded the voters that Senator Hale voted to seat U. S. Senators-suspect Vare and Smith . But the Hale men reminded the voters of Governor Brewster 's onetime Klannishness . Senator Hale was renominated by a margin of some 30,000 votes .
