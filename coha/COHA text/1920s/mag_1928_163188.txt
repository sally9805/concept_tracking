Faces of clerks working in the chain of 75 Happiness Candy Stores were animated last week . They had been thinking . <P> The Happiness clerks had been thinking of how to avoid disappointing customers who , because they see candy counters , soda fountains , lunch counters and , in five stores , complete restaurants , expect a full line of drugs . Customers whisper , their faces impassive as possible , hygienic and illegal requests to the Happiness clerks . The clerks on such frequent occasions are embarrassed . Frankly they explain that at their counters they have only bromo seltzer , aromatic spirits of ammonia , bicarbonate of soda and epsom salts , nothing more . <P> The painful situation required thought . The clerks thought , and their thoughts rose like thin spirals of incense through the executive organization of the Happiness Candy Stores , to the executive organization of the United Cigar Stores , which operates the Happiness chain . And last week the plan took form , which made the diligent store clerks rejoice . <P> In 15 or 20 Happiness Candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cigar Stores will put a stock of drugs . The candy and restaurant business will be reduced to coordinated departments of those drug stores , according to the best practice of chain merchandising . If the first stores do good business , United Cigar Stores will make more Happiness Candy Stores into United Cigar drug stores . Later will be occluded by the chain the 64 drug stores operated by the United Retail Chemists ' Corporation , a United Cigar Stores subsidiary . And later will come more retail outlets . Then Louis Kroh Liggett 's $102,500,000 United Drug Co. ' s chain of drug stores across the U. S. will have a most potent rival . United Cigar 's drug store chain will be capitalized for $25,000,000 or $30,000,000.
