Old Dog Tray had his day . Not to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd for his spectacular flight to the North Pole and back last spring at Spitzbergen but to U. S. Mail Pilot Shirley J. Short , for having flown 2,000 hours with valuable cargo in all kinds of weather and with never a serious accident or lapse in schedule , did the International League of Aviators last week award the Harmon Trophy for the best performance in 1926 by a U. S. flyer . To Pilot Georges Pelleder D'Oisy for his long distance flights ( France to Africa , Paris to Tokyo ) went the 1926 Harmon Trophy for France . <P> Mail Pilot Short 's beat is between Chicago , where he lives , and Cleveland . Aged 32 , stocky , black-mustached , cheerful , Pilot Short started flying during the War , has never stopped .
