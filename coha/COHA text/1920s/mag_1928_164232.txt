Some thirty years ago , the widow Angeline Philippe looked hard at the small boy who stood beside her . She and her husband had named him Louis . By itself , Louis was perhaps the commonest name in all Paris , but Louis Philippe smacked of kingship . With such a name , a young Parisian should go far . It was unfortunate that she had scarcely enough money to clothe or feed him . <P> But the widow Angeline was resourceful . While she put little store by such things herself , she knew that Parisian women loved to soften their skins with greasy pastes , loved to create an artificial bloom to replace the natural color which had faded . The widow Angeline bent over the kitchen stove , mixing potions , whipping them into creams . Each ingredient she showed to the round-eyed , intelligent boy . Thus Louis Philippe was trained to become , not a king , but a maker of cosmetics . <P> In 1910 , the widow Angeline and Son Louis embarked for America , settled in Manhattan . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital of $100 . Proudly , they formalized their little business , became Louis Philippe , Inc . Their first trademarked line they named the " Angelus , " the tribute of a dutiful son to the widow Angeline . By 1914 , the American public was beginning to be cosmetic-conscious . Cosmetic makers , among them the Philippes , valued their products in that year at $25,514,352 . <P> Last week , the widow Angeline , 72 , still shuffled about the factory in a faded blue denim dress , big , loose-fitting shoes . Each day at noon she bent over her stove , but she was preparing eggs , not unguents . To her alone is entrusted the task of cooking lunch for Son Louis , now a fattish little man with the traditional French pointed mustache . The widow Angeline has never troubled to learn English , but she knows that Son Louis has made money . She knows he has four motor cars , a home in fashionable Park Avenue , another in a New York suburb , four more in Europe . She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his U. S. wife and his two small children . <P> Probably she does not concern herself with figures . But Son Louis may have told her , jubilantly , that in 1927 he cleared $163,968 , and in the first five months of 1928 he made $83,161 . He may have told her , last week , that a syndicate was offering the public 40,000 shares of Louis Philippe , Inc. , cumulative participating convertible Class A common stock . She would not have understood the financial terms , but she would have known that she did well when she led her little boy to a kitchen stove in Paris . <P> It was perhaps harder for Louis Philippe to make $100 in 1910 than $163,968 in 1927 . Last year , U. S. beauty seekers paid between $400,000,000 and $500,000,000 to cosmetics makers , who had already devoted $40,000,000 to advertising . At times , the advertising pages of such magazines as the Cosmopolitan ( Hearst ) seem almost exclusively devoted to cosmetics . Every small town has its beauty specialist , its " parlors , " where creams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on sale . As an industry , cosmetics making has all the modern paraphernalia . It has its trade papers ( Toilet Requisites , Toilet Goods Economist ) , its federal supervision ( no health-destroying chemicals ) , its radio programs ( Gimbel Bros . Station WGBS ) . <P>
