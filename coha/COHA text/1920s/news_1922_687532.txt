txt By presence of mind on the part of the master of the steamship Potomac , which arrived yesterday from Bremen , a fire which had been blazing for sixteen hours was extinguished and the necessity of beaching the vessel obviated . Two members of the crew who had been overcome with smoke and another who had been struck on the head by a piece of iron had recovered when the ship reached port . Two engineers ' had 10 stand guard in the fire room with drawn revolvers over the Spanish and Filipino stqkers , who wanted to get out on deck . The fire , which was in No. 4 hold , right next to them , combined with the heat from the furnaces , made things too warm even for natives of the tropics . The Potomac left Bremen on March 1 for New York , and was eighty-three miles out in the North Sea , skirting the Dutch coast , when a Quartermaster reported that smoke was coming out of No. 4 hatch , where the provisions were stowed . Captain William , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer of the watch and word was sent to Chief Engineer E. M. Garland , who had been on duty for two dayys and nights in Bremen , overhauling the machinery , and had just gone to his cabin . The pumps were started and the chemical apparatus was turned into the ho d wrere the blaze was raging , but had little effect . At 1 A. M. the fire had gained so much headway that the heat could be felt by the watch who were wetting down the decks . The crew worked quietly and stewards were stationed at the companionways to prevent passengers from coming on deck and impeding the work of the crew . lly this time the spare straw mattresses stowed under No. 4 hatch had caught on fire and the pungent smoke made it difficult for the engineers and officers to get along the between decks to direct the hose on the fire . Smoke Overcomes Two Officers . The pumps worked steadily injecting tons of water into the hold , and the passengers , who had been unaware of the fire until they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any signs of panic because they realized that the shore was not far off and that they would- be saved by steamers standing by their blazing craft . During the forenoon Alfred Puff , a sailor , was knocked on the head by a piece of falling iron , and Chief Officer William Albrecht and Chief Engineer Garland were overcome by the smoke and were treated by Dr. William Ford , the ship 's surgeon . Garland had to remain in his cabin two days after the fire had been extinguished . At 3 P. M. on March 2 the ship was listed to starboard , and with 400 tons of water which had been pumped into No. 4 hold to quench the fire , which was on the port side , Captain decided that he had to take sudden and drastic measure if he wished to save the ship . About this time the foreign firemen and coal passers became restive and did not want to stop down below , but the presence of Assistant Engineers Edward Standish and Henry Topping with big navy revolvers in their hands decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not get the fire under control from between decks , the Captain stopped the ship just before 5 A. M. and sent men over the side in Bo'sun 's chairs with sledge hammers to ' smash in the ports opening into the blazing , hold . Lines of canvas hose were run over the side to the seamen , who placed the nozzles through the broken ports directly on to the ? ire . Just at that time a German steamer bound for Bremen came up and hove t4. - within a quarter of a mile of the Potomac , and stood by to see if Captain needed assistance . While he did not admit this yesterday . the officers said that the Captain had decided to run into the Dutch coast and beach the vessel if the fire could not be got under control before it spread to the passengers ' quarters . Avalanche of Water Smothers Fire . After sending word to the engineer in charge below to give her every pound of steam he could , the Captain ordered the quartermaster to out the helm hard aport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her list to starboard and the water went over to the opposite side of the hold with a noise like a tidal wave and knocked seven bells out of the fire , as the bo'sun said . From that time it was under control , and the flames gradually died out , after destroying a considerably quantity of stores . Whether the hull of ' the ship was damaged and how far the beams of the deck above have been warped by the heat will not be known until the surveyors have been on board tomorrow and made their examination . Chief Engineer Garland said that he intended . this to have been his last voyage to sea , and now he is sure . From now on he said that he would be content to live in Wiusted , Conn. , and look after his cabbage patch . The passengers spoke in high braise of the manner in which the fire had been handled by Captain , officers .
