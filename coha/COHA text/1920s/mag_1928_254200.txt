They would wish to hear from me not a discourse upon the platform-in which I fully concur-but something of the spirit and ideals with which it is proposed to carry it into administration . <P> " Our problems of the past seven years have been problems of reconstruction ; our problems of the future are problems of construction . They are problems of progress . . . .

The working out of agricultural relief constitutes the most important obligation of the next Administration . . . .
