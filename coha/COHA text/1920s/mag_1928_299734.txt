As the U. S. cruiser Detroit swung into the Irish harbor of Kingstown last week , 40 bravely martial fortress guns went BOOM ! ! <P> There was , however , a pause after the 21st boom , which divided the 40 detonations into a 21-gun salute for President William Thomas Cosgrave of the Irish Free State , and a 19-gun salute for U. S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg , both on board the cruiser . <P> Secretary Kellogg was visiting President Cosgrave , who was returning to Ireland after having signed at Paris a parchment called The Multilateral Treaty for Renouncing War as an Instrument of National Policy , Representatives of 15 nations had signed in Paris ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) . Moreover , when President Cosgrave and Secretary Kellogg stepped upon Irish soil , they knew that several additional nations had already declared their desire and intention to sign . <P> Among these were Liberia , Peru , Costa Rica , Santo Domingo , Panama , Uruguay , Cuba , Brazil , Austria , Switzerland , Denmark , Finland , Czechoslovakia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Haiti , Latvia , Greece , Bulgaria , Lithuania and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics . <P> The Russian note , despatched by Comrade Maxim Maximovich Litvinov , Vice Commissar of Foreign Affairs , raised pointed objections to the Treaty , but indicated that Soviet Russia would sign anyway , for better or worse . <P> Excerpts from the Red note : <P> " . . . the Soviet Government has considered and considers now that the carrying out of a plan for universal and full disarmament is the only actual means of preventing armed conflicts . . . . <P> " It is necessary to recognize in the Kellogg pact lack of any obligations for disarmament , which are the only genuine guarantee of peace ; the insufficiency and indefiniteness of the formula itself for the prohibition of war ; and the existence of several reservations having the object to suspend in advance even appearance of obligations toward the cause of peace . <P> " Nevertheless , inasmuch as the pact objectively imposes certain obligations on the powers before public opinion and gives the Soviet Government a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest importance for peace - the question of disarmament , the solution of which is the only guarantee of preventing war-the Soviet Government expresses its consent to sign the Paris pact . " <P> A potent commentator on the treaty was Signor Arnaldo Mussolini , editor of Il Popolo d'ltalia , founded by his brother , Signor Benito Mussolini . <P> Said Signor Arnaldo : " There is no need to laugh at this pact , signed with much solemnity by various great Powers . . . but . . . there is in this Kellogg pact . . . much rhetoric and transparent insincerity . <P> " . . . The Papacy was right when it recently said that the Kellogg pact is not a novelty , but already the thousand-year-old patrimony of the Church of Rome . . . . Anyway . . . politics is an ugly fiction . " <P> While acclaimers and decriers warmly discussed the treaty , Secretary Kellogg received the freedom of the city of Dublin , admired Irish countryside , wenches , embarked for the U. S.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
