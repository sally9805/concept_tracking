In Denver , they have buried the hatchet , brought out the peace dove , shaken hands , spoken words of mutual praise , given up things for the common weal . <P> Who buried the hatchet ? One party is Fred G. Bonfils , sometime gambler , fighter , and more recently philanthropist , who is proud to say that his grandfather ( surnamed Buonfiglio ) was a cousin of Napoleon Bonaparte . When the West was a gold brick , Mr. Bonfils bounced about until he profited $800,000 in the Little Louisiana Lottery . Then he ran into a garrulous bartender named H. H. Tammen and they bought a newspaper , the Denver Post , with which they fattened the gambler 's wad and extended the bartender 's ingenuity . They had a circus , too ( Sells-Floto ) . But , for raw meat and dripping ballyhoo , the Denver Post was a circus in itself . The reputation of Mr. Bonfils was to use the hatchet , but not to bury it . <P> The other party is Roy Wilson Howard , smartly groomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stepped into the Denver field two years ago , purchased the Rocky Mountain News ( morning ) and formed the Evening News to compete with Mr. Bonfils ' Post ( evening ) . Mr. Bonfils soon issued a Morning Post ( TIME , Jan. 17 , 1927 ) . The competition was a vicious fight-a circulation war , a death-grapple for advertising , a snarling in editorials , a sneering in news columns . <P> How did they bury the hatchet ? Mr. Howard , returning from a hunting trip in Wyoming , stopped off in Denver , talked with Mr. Bonfils . They talked , off and on , for nearly a week . Finally , each agreed to kill a newspaper . This leaves Denver with the Scripps-Howard Rocky Mountain News for its breakfast table and the Bonfils Post for its afternoon fare , with both for its Sunday picnic . The prices were raised by both publishers from 2 daily and 5 Sunday to 3 daily and 10 Sunday . The Rocky Mountain News added Associated Press service to its United Press service. * The Post added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bury the hatchet ? Because newspaper wars , especially long ones , cost money . Because Denver advertisers , and all advertisers , prefer two papers to four papers , especially when the two papers represent monopolies in their respective ( morning and evening ) fields . <P> Mr. Howard : " The plain truth of the matter , plus a sportsmanlike desire to give credit where credit is due , compels the frank admission that after having been afforded two years ' opportunity to judge of a result which had involved the employment of much ingenuity and the expenditure of several million dollars , an overwhelming majority of the people of Denver and the adjacent newspaper field continued their preference for the type of evening paper produced by F. G. Bonfils in the Evening Post , rather than for the type offered by Scripps-Howard in the Evening News . ... On the other hand , the Rocky Mountain News under Scripps-Howard management has enjoyed a rebirth . . . . " <P> Mr. Bonfils : " That burial has now been done for the benefit of the subscriber and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better newspaper feeling and co-operation . . . making this a better and a more wholesome country in which to live , rear our families and transact our business . . . . These two papers are going to try to deserve the respect and friendship of each other . . . . " <P>
