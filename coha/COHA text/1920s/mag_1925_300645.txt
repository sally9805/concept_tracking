The Life and Language of Mr. Weber and Mr. Fields <P> The Book . Two undernourished young U. S. Hebrews-one fat , one skinny-came to fame in 1873 for their mutilations of the English language . Music-hall audiences rippled and rocked when they heard , just before an act came on , the plaintive offstage whisper of the fat one ( Weber ) to the skinny one ( Fields ) - " Do n't push me , Meyer ! " When the pair were at the height of their popularity , 20 years ago . they disagreed , separated . Friends called this a " business suicide . " This winter , they have returned to the two-a-day , are playing certain Western towns under the management of Keith 's Theatres , Inc . But this winter the whisper is not quite so funny ; there is a ghost in its levity . For that whisper belongs to the theatrical days of which Savoyards reminisce with wistful head-shakings , of which Mr. Isman , in a similar manner , writes in this book . <P> He tells about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Esther , Leah , Rae , Rebecca , Flora , Anna , George , Abraham , Solomon , Philip , Max and Joseph , little Joseph . They lived in a shoe on Mott Street , Manhattan . ' Nearby , Lew Schanfield tended a street soda-fountain for a man named Gump . One night . Fields taught Weber a dance step he knew . Another night , the little lights on the facade of a brand-new music hall pricked out a trade-name that had become a tradition : WEBER AND FIELDS . They owned the place . <P> Between those two nights were many tumbles , shuffles ; Weber and Fields clogged in dime museums , warbled for sidewalk audiences , galooted in saloons for $2 a day and 3 beer checks , toured with variety troups . Pages of their jocular maudlinity fill the book . <P> Maudlinity came to be worth the incredible sum of $6,000 a week to them . They formed their own company . Famed were its members : Peter F. Daily , " the quickest-witted man who ever wore grease-paint " , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every evening in his dressing room ; golden Lillian Russell who " broke 1,000 hearts a night " when she sang Rosie , you are my Posie ; David Warfield , William Collier , Fay Templeton , De Wolf Hopper , Bessie McCoy , Frankie Bailey , Sam Bernard . <P> When Weber and Fields dissolved partnership in 1904 , and the curtain , descending to the strains of Auld Lang Sync , ended the company 's farewell performance , notables of society , stage , politics stood up in their chairs , weeping , shouting , refused to leave until Weber , until Fields , had responded . <P> " Speech ! " they yelled . <P> Weber 's voice carried only to the front rows . <P> " We can only say that we are sorry , " he murmured . <P> " Fields ! " they cried . <P> " I can only echo the sentiments of Mr. Weber , " said the skinny Mr. Fields . <P> The Significance . Mr. Isman 's narrative is like an old music-hall tune played on a street organ .
