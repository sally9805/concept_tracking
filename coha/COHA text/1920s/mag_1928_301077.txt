Earl Carroll , producer of musical shows , whose hospitality on one occasion was so extravagant as to cause him to lie and go to jail for four months , last week made preparations for a new revue . His preparations included an inspection of would-be chorines , of whom he allegedly required that they strut naked in front of him , so that he could observe their defects . <P> Two chorines , whether because they were shy , or because they wanted publicity , or because they were not awarded jobs , raged at this requirement . They caused the New York Daily News to print their pictures with stories damning Earl Carroll , quoting George White , " Ziggy " and such showmen as being shocked by Earl Carroll 's nude parade . The effort to start another Earl Carroll rumpus failed ; District Attorney Joab H. Banton pointed out that even if the chorines were telling the truth , Earl Carroll had committed no crime . <P> Smart Richard Montague last week discovered that the famed Keith-Albee Corp . considers Lindbergh , Mussolini and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractions now extant . To each they would pay $10,000 a week . President Coolidge or President-Elect Hoover could get $3,000 . Al Smith could get $7,000 . Queen Mary is worth $5,000 . Queen Marie is worth $8,000.
