He Has Three Ambitions <P> The author of Greenmantle , Midwinter , The Three Hostages ( one of the finest romances of modern times ) was in Manhattan the other day for a few hours . Lieutenant Colonel John Buchan is a short , quiet-spoken , modest English author . In those characteristics , he is like Walter de la Mare and W. Somerset Maugham , our other English visitors of the moment . They arrived without blaring of trumpets-and both Buchan and Maugham departed quietly , after seeing a few things at the theatre and saying " how-do-you-do-goodbye " to a few friends . <P> When I met John Buchan the other day , I said to him : " How I should like to find time to read your History of the Great War . " His reply was : " Well , there are a million words of it ! " He is not only a writer of stirring romantic novels , but the best historian , so far , of the recent War . In fact , two talents-literary and historical - became evident early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects while at Oxford , where he was educated after preliminaries at Glasgow University . <P> He was born in Scotland , in 1875 , at Perth , of an old Border family . His mother was a cousin of Mr. Gladstone . Mr. Buchan regards writing as his avocation . He was called to the English bar in 1901 . He has seen duty in South Africa-both worked and shot big game there . He has collaborated in writing a legal textbook on taxation of foreign income . He is partner in Thomas Nelson &; Sons , one of the largest publishing houses in the world . Nor has he escaped politics ; he once stood for his county as Unionist candidate for Parliament . His War career was brilliant , progressing from newspaper correspondent , intelligence officer in active battle to Director of Information under the Prime Minister ( Lloyd George ) and the War Cabinet . <P> A man of many interests , and one of action-thoroughly admirable . I like this recent statement of his ambitions : " I regard business as my profession , writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of politics was going to be my duty . I have three ambitions in each sphere : To write a full Life of General Robert E. Lee ; to make the best literature accessible to the poorest purse and in any language ; and to do a little to help bring about the full understanding of America and the British Empire , which I regard as the biggest thing that can come out of the War and the main guarantor of the future .
