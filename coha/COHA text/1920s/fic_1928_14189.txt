THE sun has gone down over the Oxendine clearing and a sort of steaming night-sweat creeps up and around the cabin from the feverish surrounding swamps . FESS OXENDINE , a powerful Croatan Negro of middle age with a swarthy copperish face , stands by the pig-pen holding a bucket in his hand and watching his pig eat slops . The pig finally finishes his guzzlings and squeals and gnaws at the rails for more , but FESS pays no attention to him now , watching on with unseeing eyes . The dusk gradually thickens in the little field , swamp owls begin their mournful calling , and presently a mocking-bird bursts into a lonely chatter in the one pear tree near the garden . FESS with a mutter shakes his shoulders and looks morosely around at the sky . The spectacle of the west burning in a flame and the clouds marching in glory seems to irritate and awe him . With a low oath , he lurches across his few potato rows and into the house . Sitting down by the fire-place , he begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mop of heavy hair . In the back of the room is a bed and to the left of that a broken-down cot . A rough eating-table is in the center . Three or four pots and pans hang to the right of the fire-place and in the corner a cupboard contains some provisions and a few cracked dishes . There are two or three chairs with untanned cowhide bottoms . A door at the right opens to the outside , and in the left wall is a wooden window with a double-barreled shot gun above it . Old clothes are hanging on nails about the room . FESS Slapping himself and muttering . Mon , dem domn muskeeters seem lak try to eat you up . He beats about him with his ragged felt hat and sits listening . Why ' o n't she come on hyuh ? And dem owls , dem owls , seem lak worse dan useter . He lights a sputtering lamp , sets it on the table and resumes his seat before the hearth . Presently he lifts the lid from the spider sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite t'eat . Knowed it . Min ' take my cowhide when she come and beat the clothes off'n her . Whah she gone nohow ? Pondering . Sump'n in her mind , dat 's a fac ' . He wanders to the door , looks out , and gives a sharp whistle . As he waits with no reply , his face grows distorted with anger , and he yells . Heigh , you , Vonie ! ' Come out'n dat ' ere swamp ef you 's down dere . ' His hound shakes himself in the yard and coming up into the door leans against his leg . The brute 's gesture of kindliness infuriates him and with a savage kick , he hurls him from him . In a burst of anger he springs across the room , jerks down the gun and hurries to the door . Gwine shoot dat God-domn dog . Git f'om hyuh , you dirty suck-aig devil ! Allus in de way . He raises his gun and fires , and the dog runs screaming across the field . He fires a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the swamp . Then , heaving a great sigh , he sets the stock of the gun on his foot . Unh-hunh , I been telling dat Nick to keep out'n my way . Anh , dat purty sudden dough , shooting him lak dat . Chuckling . Sho ' tore up his tail wid dem shot , I betcha . He stands thinking . Seem lak eye'y-thing gitting wrong wid me . My haid des ' flies all to pieces . Shaking himself . Wish't I could fohgit dat ' ere dream I had  --  oh  --  Lawd ! Next thing I 'll be putting a load o ' shot in dat Vonie . He gets two shells from the cupboard , reloads the gun , and replaces it above the window ; after which he sets about stirring up the fire and preparing supper . He places a frying-pan on the coals and begins hacking off huge slices of white side meat at the cupboard . While he is thus occupied , VONIE shuffles quietly in . She is a middle-aged Negro , dressed in dirty rags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One eye is missing from her head , leaving a red membraneous slit between her lids . Her face is dead and sagging and unrelieved by any vitality even in her one good eye . As she enters , FESS whirls upon her with a shout , raising the knife in his hand . Yeah , and where you been to , ' oman ? p. 3 VONIE Dragging off her bonnet and sitting quietly in a chair . Off . FESS With a guttural snarl . Reckon I knows it , and you gone de whole evenin ' . Seizing her and putting the knife against her throat . Gooder min'er rip yo ' gullet open . Whah you been to , I axes you ? VONIE Choking out the words . Off , off a little piece . FESS Crushing her down in her seat . Spet out , spet out ! What you up to . VONIE closes her eye and drops her head limply against his hand . He gives her throat a little sharp prick and steps back from her with a threatening chuckle . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to no tricks , you know me  --  VONIE Wiping a trickle of blood from her throat with her apron and speaking in a thin stifled voice . Gouge t' other eye out , anh ? FESS Throwing his knife down and slumping in a chair . Mon 's ' oman tell de shuriff on him orter have ' em both bored out wid a chunk o ' far . VONIE Ai n't no shuriff dis time .

FESS Dat what you been doing off in dem woods ? VONIE Ne ' mind . FESS Do n't talk too sharp wid me , nigger , VONIE suddenly breaks into a low sardonic and toothless laugh . FESS turns and gazes at her in astonishment , then shrugs his shoulders carelessly . Yo ' misery mak ' you laugh lak dat ? p. 5 VONIE Mebbe . FESS Bounding out of his chair . ' Y God you stop dat and git a move on you ' bout my supper . He moves toward her . Hyuh I been waiting , and I got to hurry to de swamps . VONIE Better not go to dat still tonight . FESS Hunh ?

There is a noise outside and old QUEENIE stands in the door . FESS looks at her a moment and then sits quietly in his chair near the fire . The old woman comes in , followed by her twin daughters . She is an incredibly ancient GUINEA NEGRO of a bluish-black color , drawn and skinny , with bright little eyes , and dressed in a single garment of dull red flannel . She walks with a stick and carries a little leather satchel on her arm . The twins , dressed in the same dull stuff , and holding hands , follow her into the room . They are about sixty years old and walk with short quivering palsied steps , their tiny bonneted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two snakes . As they enter they fasten their beady eyes on FESS , who moves closer against the wall. p. 12 OLD QUEENIE Motioning with her stick and speaking in a husky jerky voice . Set over dere .

VONIE Rising and placing her a chair . Set down and rest yo ' se'f . OLD QUEENIE Huskily . Who dat man ? VONIE Dat Fess , de daddy o ' her . FESS watches her narrowly , abstractedly pulling out his snuff-box . OLD QUEENIE Sho ' dat Fess . Pleasantly . Bad man , ai n't you , Fess ? FESS Growling . What you doing hyuh in my house ? He turns his head away and begins dipping . Old ' oman what de snakes useter suck . A sudden gleam comes into QUEENIE 'S eye , quickly passing away . OLD QUEENIE How you all gitting on ?

She takes the snuff and puts some in her lip and nose . You do n't seem so quare adder all . Old QUEENIE suddenly sneezes and then inhales with a deep breath of delight .

Look at deir little haids and deir little black eyes , des lak a snake foh de world . She sneezes again and the twins grow more and more excited , their heads appearing to rise higher and higher on the stems of their scrawny necks. p. 14 FESS Mak ' em quit looking at me dat-a-way . She hands the snuff-box back to him . OLD QUEENIE Dat mighty good snuff , Fess . She sneezes twice in rapid succession and turns and looks at the twins . Their tongues begin to flutter between their lips as they look hungrily at their mother . FESS Suspiciously . Why you sneeze so ? VONIE looks up intently . OLD QUEENIE Speaking gently over her shoulder . Good snuff , Fess , good Lord o ' God . She opens her mouth , wrinkles her nose , and then sneezes sharply . The two women sit up stiff and straight on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seben times ! She totters to the door and looks out over her left shoulder . Dere it is , dere 's de new moon behime dat poplar . All ready , fixed and ready , fixed and ready . FESS Standing up . Do n't you start dat ' ere business , I tell you .

OLD QUEENIE Touching VONIE 's bent back with her stick . Fetch me huh dress and bonnet . VONIE rises and gets a dress and bonnet from a nail in the wall . QUEENIE places a chair to the table , spreads the dress over it , and puts the bonnet on top , forming a crude dummy . FESS watches every movement with skeptical braggadocio . Old QUEENIE calls . Chillun ! p. 16 LIL AND FURY Softly . Yeh , mam . OLD QUEENIE Kin you heah me ? LIL AND FURY Us heah you . OLD QUEENIE Kin huh heah me ? LIL AND FURY Huh heah you too . OLD QUEENIE Chuckling .

They bend their heads toward the center of the table and blow in the bowl . Presently a curl of smoke rises upward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumes and sit stiffly back in their chairs looking unblinkingly at old QUEENIE .

Thick clouds of smoke pour upward and settle about the room . Breave it , chillun , breave it . She takes a little red flannel pouch out of the satchel and pours some white powder in each of the three plates . The twins wet their fingers and dip the powder into their mouths . QUEENIE coaxes them on . Look down , ' way down yander in dat t' other place . Look down . LIL AND FURY In a far-away voice . Us looking . OLD QUEENIE Kin see dere ?
