A. conference labeled " not a convention . " Conventions are mostly deadly things , and the topic of this " conference " called for something distinctly personal : it was : What Resources Has Jesus for Life in Our World ? <P> Though there were celebrated speakers , including Henry Sloane Coffin and Scientist Robert A. Millikan , -* the essential spiritual give and take of the students themselves was the feature - a thing incapable of analysis by newspapers , interested in " headline stuff .

At 30 years of age the boy has become a father with a three-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claus , and the Christmas spirit is the most beautiful thing in the world . "
