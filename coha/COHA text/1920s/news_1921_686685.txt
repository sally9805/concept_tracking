txt England has need of JAN CHRISTIAN SMUTS ; Europe has need of him . By sheer force of high moral principle , political foresight and wisdom , he has come to a foremost place among the statesmen of the world . All nations of this disturbed globe may be said to have need of his calm ' judgment . Gencral SMUTS addressed the Imperial Conference on Tuesday in terms that any company of statesmen the world over might have listened to with ofit . He foresees the shifting of the entre of political interest from Eu ' , To to the Far East and the Pacific . : : : the problems to be solved there ? : Itring the next fifty years or more . ! IC British Empire will be vitally in. ? rested , and " there Europe , Asia and America are meeting , and there believe the next great chapter in " human history will be enacted . " rite all-important question is whether ? . this transfer to a new theatre the eFors in the drama of world politics are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new chapter of history be y. - ritten as the history of Europe has fe.en written during the past cenlaries ? As General SMUTS puts it : I ask myself what will be the , : eltaracter of that history  --  will it be : , long the old lines , will it be the old spirit of national and imperial dom1-7 ; itation which has been the undoing of Europe , or shall *eve have learned our lesson , shall we have purged our souls if . the fires through which we have passed ? Will it be a future of peaceful co-operation , of friendly co-ordination of all the vast interests at stake ? Shall we act in continuous friendly consultation , in the true spirit of a society of nations , or will there once more be a repetition of rival groups , of exclusive alliances , and finally of a terrible catastrophe more fatal than the one we have passed through ? That , to my mind , is the alternative ; that is the parting of the ways at which we have arrived . For " exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are for ends , purely selfish , that beget suspicion and jealousy and lead to quarrels . It might be asked at once what need has England to renew her exclusive treaty of alliance with Japan ? The original treaty when first negotiated was not popular . The renewal in 1905 was disliked in England ; it was very much disliked here . In the renewal now proposed the Dominions insist that there be unmistakable provisions excluding England from participation in any difference Japan might have with the United States . - But why any treaty of this kind at all ? Neither Japan nor Great Britain has " special interests " known to the world which would seem to require safeguarding by alliance just now , and many Western nations may be moved to inquire what bearing the Anglo-Japanese Treaty is going to have on the future of China . Better than treaty alliances between two - nations or groups of nations is the compact of peace and justice of ill nations . Addressing Mr. LLOYD ' GEORGE , General SMUTS called up the subject that lies very near his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many nations ; You spoke yesterday most eloquently on the Peace Treaty , the sacredness of the Peace Treaty and the obligation to carry out the Peace Treaty . There is one chapter in that Treaty which , to my mind , should be specially sacred to the British Empire . That is the first chapter of the League of Nations . The Covenant may be faulty , it may need amendment in order to make it more workable and more generally ac. ceptable , but let us never forget that the Covenant embodies the most deeply felt longings of the human race for a better life . There more than anywhere else do we find serious effort made to translate into practical reality the great ideals that actuated us during the war : ildeals for which millions of our best owe their lives , a method of undersVi-nding instead of the ' violence of foi Nee . The operation of consultation and conference in all great difficulties , which we have found so fruitful in our empire system , is the method which the League attempts to apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Empire back it for all it is wbrth . It may well prove away out of the present morass . It ' may become the foundation of a. new - international system which will render armaments unnecessary and give the world at large the . ' blessings which we enjoy in our ; lesser league of nations in the empire . ' These are words for meditatiOn an pondering by Americans ; most of all , perhaps , by Americana . They will ht scornfully put aside by our irrecon ? cilables ; they will ha-4e no consideration from the Irish and the Gerznanv. who built up . the much-talked-of 7,000,000 majority . But the ideas of General SMUTS have , it .. vital quality that does not pertain to policies born of hatred , personal , Partisan or national , those being the three particular branches of the hate which gave rise to the defeat of the Treaty , here . The Ideas , thoughts and principles of this great statesman have the power of survival , they influence the minds of men , the destinies of nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both his immediate and his ' wider audience , it is to be hoped , will give serious attention to his counsels of safety and wisdom .
