First there was an oil lease . Then there was suspicion . Investigations followed suspicion . Suits , civil and criminal , followed investigation . Out of the civil suits came proven illegalities and the U. S. got back its " Teapot Dome " oil reserve in Natrona <P> County , Wyo. , Out of the criminal suit in the District of Columbia Supreme Court , to see if Albert Bacon Fall , onetime ( 1921-23 ) Cabinet man , and Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair , were criminals or not , came more suspicion , much confusion , a mistrial . <P> The Principals . Albert Bacon Fall , his lungs congested , despaired greatly and wished that his criminal trial might begin afresh . But it could not begin afresh until January . Wrapped in a blue velvet bathrobe , Mr. Fall gathered strength to go home to New Mexico for Christmas . He reiterated his protests of innocence and said : " Unless doctors forbid me to return to Washington in January , I will come . But I must consider my family and , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little longer before going across the Great Divide . " <P> Harry Ford Sinclair , although younger , stronger , bolder and far richer than Mr. Fall , had an even less pleasant time ahead . For it was upon him and his friends that the fresh suspicion had fastened-suspicion of attempted jury-tampering , the last resort of wealthy felons . <P> But , just as the disrepute of Oilman Sinclair and friends momentarily overshadowed that of Mr. Fall , so , last week , did the disrepute of yet other " villains " in the story overshadow " the villainy " of Oilman Sinclair and friends . <P> The " villainy " of Oilman Sinclair 's friends was hiring detectives to shadow the jury that was trying him , the new " villains " were these same detectives and notably their chiefs-Detective William John Burns , his son Sherman Burns and their " chief shad-ower , " one Charles G. Ruddy . Not only in the " villainy " of these three but in their collective stupidity was the public invited by the press to take special satisfaction as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oilman Sinclair 's friends and vice presidents-Henry Mason Day and Sheldon Clark-were " villains " from the start last week . They refused to tell the grand jury anything about the hiring of the Burns detectives . They said they were afraid of incriminating themselves . They were arrested , released on bail. *Their hearings were put off until after Thanksgiving Day , while the government ran out other aspects of the case . " Hero " Burns . Detective William John Burns began last week in a heroic capacity . As soon as he heard that his 16 agents in Washington had been caught sleuthing the Fall-Sin clair jury , he announced that they had broken no law , " approached " no juror . He hurried down to Washington from Manhattan with a lot of papers , his face boiled red with righteous indignation . <P> He told newsgatherers that he was going to talk " long and loud " and started to do so . He willingly went before the grand jury . He told a hideous tale . <P> " Hero " Burns ' Tale . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But not by Burns men ! <P> There had been jury-tampering by an agent-of the U. S. Government !
