txt Albert B. Fall former Secretary of the Interior , and Edward L. Doheny , oil magnate , were arraigned in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia this morning to plead to indictments charging them with having entered into a conspiracy to defraud the Government In the matter of the leasing of the Elk Hills oil fields in California . Both entered pleas of not guilty , and the date of the trial , the first of the criminal proceedings involving Mr. Fall and Mr. Doheny , was set for Nov. 22 . The Court ordered bail continued in the sum of $5,000 each . Thirty-three months have elapsed since Mr. Doheny , appearing before the Senate Committee on Public Lands , admitted having loaned $100,000 to Mr. Fall , which he declared was nothing more than an effort on his part to aid an old friend in the hour of his need . The Government will contend that the loan was in fact a gift , if not a bribe , and that the lease of the Elk Hills Naval oil reserves was the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Doheny has expressed a desire to take the witness stand in his own defense , and his request has been submitted to his chief counsel , Frank J. Hogan of this city and Frederick R. Kellogg of New York . They have not , it is understood , decided to grant the request , but the impression is general that when the time comes Mr. Doheny will be called as the chief witness In his own defense . On the other hand , the impression is that Mr. Fall will not take the stand , although the question is still in abeyance , according to talk in court circles . Mr. Fall and Mr. Doheny , escorted by their lawyers , entered the court room a few minutes before 10 o'clock this morning . Mr. Doheny seemed to be In fine health , but Mr. Fall looked only the shadow of the robust man who was known so long in Washington , first as Senator from New Mexico and subsequently as Secretary of the Interior in the Cabinet of President Harding . In those days the Secretary weighed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his friends that he was under 145 pounds . As soon as Justice Hoehling ascended the bench Mr. Hogan announced that Mr. Doheny and Mr. Fall were ready to plead to the indictment . The clerk put the question to Mr. Doheny , who answered " not guilty " In a voice that rang clearly through the room . A moment later Mr. Fall entered his plea of not guilty and the proceedings were then adjourned until Nov. 22 . The court room was packed to capacity when Mr. Fall and Mr. Doheny faced Justice Hoehling . It was the first time in history in which a former member of the Cabinet had been arraigned , charged with a crime involving his administration of the executive department of which he had been head . When the trial begins it is doubtful if the general public will be admitted , owing to the small seating capacity of the court room . If the crowd that sought to get into the room today ? and not more than one-third of them succeeded  --  indicates what is coming , an auditorium would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the trial . The lawyers in the case will be Mr. Hogan , Mr. Kellogg , Harold Walker of New York , and Joseph J. Cotter of Washington , for Mr. Doheny , and exUnited States District Attorney Henry A. Wise of New York , Levi Cooke of Washington and Mark P. Thompson of New Mexico for Mr. Fall ; Wilton J. Lambert of this city may also be counsel for Mr. Fall . For the Government the lawyers are ex-Senator Atlee Pomerene of Cleveland , Owen J. Roberts of Philadelphia and District Attorney Peyton Gordon of the District of Columbia . The pending case has no relation whatever to the case of Harry F. Sinclair and Mr. Fall , which involves the lease of the Teapot Dome to the Sin-clair interests . The criminal proceedings in that case are not expected to start until some time in the early months of next year . A second case charging bribery is also pending against Mr. Doheny , Mr. Fall and Edward L. Doheny Jr .                @ @ @ @ @
