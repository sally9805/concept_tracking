Scowling , muttering , grumbling among themselves , some U. S. artists paced their studios . They were not merely annoyed ; they felt grieved and hurt . On the upper end of Manhattan Island a vast edifice was arising , the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , which had been conceived and financed not solely as a monument to religion , but as a monument to U. S. religion , supported by all creeds and classes , a monument to and by U. S. art , an expression of the nation 's creative genius in the 20th Century . <P> And see what had happened . The architect in charge , Dr. Ralph Adams Cram of Boston , had already employed an English sculptor , a fine man of great ability , one John Angell , but still a foreigner , to execute twelve statues in the Cathedral 's baptistry . <P> Last week , at his home in Sudbury , Mass. , Architect Cram heard of this discontent . He spoke over the telephone to the New York Times , saying : <P> That Sculptor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . <P> That he had gone abroad for this foreigner only after offering the work to two Americans , who were occupied for two or three years to come and could not accept . <P> That , in general , it was difficult to find American sculptors who were proficient at draped figures , their training being chiefly classical , in nudes , of which cathedral architecture makes little use . <P> That he had asked for funds to investigate further the work of American sculptors , and proposed to use just as many of them as could work in accord with the Gothic style of the Cathedral , but : <P> " If any American sculptors take any position against the employment of fine artists from other countries in order that they may get the work themselves , I will do everything in my power to stop any such sculptor from getting any work on the Cathedral . . . . Neither the trustees nor I will be dictated to by any artist or any sculptor whatever . " <P> This attitude was swiftly indorsed by Professor Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division of Fine Arts which is raising $150,000 ( from sculptors , $10,000 ) for a Fine Arts Bay in the Cathedral . He said : " The Cathedral is not being built for the benefit of American sculptors or architects but for the cause of religion . . . . Dr. Cram is entirely correct in feeling that he must get the best sculptors he can find . " <P> The U. S. studios loosed their thunder . Meetings were planned , resolutions framed . August Lukeman , sculptor of the Stone Mountain Memorial to the Confederacy , was first to be heard : <P> " That arrogant statement Architect Cram 's should not debar any man from discussing what is purely a matter of principle-namely , whether a so-called national monument . . . should not be made an expression of the country and the times by the exclusive use of the talent and genius of America . . . . There is nothing personal in what I have to say . Dr. Cram says that he offered the work to one or two Americans before employing Angell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have offered it , and men of the greatest competence . The truth of the matter is that Dr. Cram does not know the work that is being done , by American sculptors . . . . "
