A chubby and phenomenally lifelike corpse lay in state last week at the Croatian capital of Zagreb . Throughout the entire province , peasants burned mourning candles under black shades and church bells tolled at midnight . Among some thousands of pious , grieving folk only the corpse seemed cheerful . A contented smile curved the dead lips , and the face was not " deathly pale " but merely less tanned and florid than usual . As the black-hooded candles danced , and solemn prayers were uttered , cables flashed around the Globe that Death had come to Stefan Raditch . <P> A volume crammed with paradoxes might conceivably sum up the man . Yet all his inconsistencies sprang from a consistent love of fellow men and a consistent impatience with vested authority . Perhaps the key fact is that Stefan Raditch 's parents were Gypsies . He rose beyond their sphere to become the greatest champion of Croatian Freedom ; but he remained always a rolling stone , shrewd and earthy . Even his lying in state smacked of paradox . The spacious death chamber was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Gypsy Raditch had turned it years ago into a democratic , almost proletarian Party Headquarters . <P> The corpse of such a man may well smile optimistically , as though the soul were soaring up among Croatian angels , all crying , " Zhivoi Raditch ! Hail Raditch ! " <P> Curiously , the Death of Croat Raditch caused a potent repercussion in the household of a famed U. S. Middle Western couple who are now honeymooning* in England . The husband , Mr. Sinclair Lewis , found his wife suddenly a-pecking at his typewriter . Mrs. Lewis is the onetime **27;6802;TOOLONG Dorothy Thompson . Therefore , just as a cry of " Help ! " will cause a retired life guard to dive automatically ; so the " break " of the big story at Zagreb set Mrs. Lewis to reeling off a long and able despatch which was soon read with surprise by devotees of her old papers , the New York Evening Post and Philadelphia Public Ledger . <P> " I knew quite well the Croatian Peasant leader Stefan Raditch . ... I have visited him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Such was the sure-fire lead which Mrs. Sinclair Lewis slapped upon her story . She continued : <P> ' " No political leader now living ever has changed his tactics and his outer program more often or more radically . He was a Pan-Slav Anti-Habsburg agitator before the World War , yet he supported Hungary and the Habsburgs during the War . <P> " When the Kingdom of Jugoslavia was founded he . . . became leader of a Croatian Sinn Fein , refusing to allow the 50 Deputies of his party to go to Belgrade . Then he got into touch with Moscow . . . . The result was six months ' imprisonment for treason . . . . He was released when he had indicated his willingness to abandon his ... Sinn Fein policy . . . and to cooperate with Belgrade i.e. , with the Government of Jugoslavia . <P> " I was in Jugoslavia at the time of his imprisonment and release . Everything had been done to damage him in the eyes of his supporters . The conservative peasants had been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been released because he had promised to reverse his whole policy . <P> " What political leader could withstand such attacks with such evidence to support them ?
