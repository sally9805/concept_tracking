txt The Gulf of Alexico with the Caribbean Sea , which feeds it , is the greatest inland sea of the world . It could absorb the Mediterranean and most of Europe outside of Russia . Its waters are the heart of the Atlantic . Here rises the Gulf Stream which warms the North Atlantic and Western Europe . It is a beginning and a center of the Southern Pacific 's Empire . No railroad system has so much at stake on its waters . The states and countries on its border could duplicate the possibilities of our Pacific and southwest country and except for apples , furnish the food of the North American continent . While in Louisiana the Southern Pacific has 783 miles it has ; in Texas : 1.000 of its 13,482 miles . Texas is the greatest cotton state and the greatest oil state in the union , and the Southern Pacific goes through nearly every one of its oil fields and has about half the business origi-1 natieg from oil Other states have harbors , but Texas as well as Florida has endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters of the Gulf straight up from Galves-i ton to the it of Houston , fifty miles inland . THE PORT OF FIOVSTON Houston has the hustle , and the Southern Pacific is ; hustling along with it and spending millions on the deep- ; water terminal of Houston . When I counted up a dozen railroads , big and little. , entering New Orleans , 1 thought no centre in the South could pass it , but Houston I found advertised as " inhere 17 railroads touch the sea and flags of nations meet " . Here is the heat t of the Southern Pacific in Texas . Its payroll and annual expenditure herg is above ten millions . Colton exports from Houston have reached a million bales and oil exports above two and a half million tons . In 1919 oil exports were 131.000 tons and cotton exports 45,000 hales from the port of Houston . The Houston ship channel is to be 250 feet wide and no feet deep and including the turning basin four million dollars are being expended on this development . Already more than sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6/01 THORN teirzt-s STEAMERS The Southern Pacific System is divided into four operating units . San Francisco is headquarters for every- thing on the Pacific and east to El Paso and the connection with the Rock Island in New Mexico . A second division covers Mexico , and a third division embraces Texas and Louisiana . But the entire traffic direction of the system is under Lewis J. Spence , who is the executive officer of the steamship lines , which is the fourth division , and on the board of directors of the Southern Pacific System . This shows the importance , present and future , of the steamship lines . The Southern Pacific is the only railroad owning its own steamship lines . It is , therefore , the only railroad able to compete with the Panama Canal . It is a popular misconception that all rates are made by the Interstate Commerce Commission and that competition no longer exists . But the Interstate Commerce Commission only exercises supervision . ite I LILO AD C'OMPETI'TION Rates are still initiated by the carriers and there is more competition between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition in service , but viewing the Southern Pacific System as a whole , one notes that salt from the Louisiana mines is marketed in Chicago and other middle western cities in competition with salt produced in Kansas , Michigan and New York . Sugar refined from California beets , as well as from sugar cane in the Hawaiian Island , is marketed in the Missouri River cities , Chicago and Minneapolis , in competition with sugar refined at New Orleans from Louisiana cane , and sugar from Cuba and Porto Rico refined at the Atlantic coast . One would not ordinarily understand that the Southern Pacific dominion really reached from Hawaii to Porto Rico . But Traffic Director Spence must know the commercial interests at both these points . The units composing the Southern Pacific System combine to make rates to meet such competition as that created by the steamship lines operating through the Panama Canal , and the Southern Pacific Lines in Mexico must combine with those in the United States to meet competition of steamship lines operating along the Pacific Coast between Mexican and United States ports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transportation interests of the United States will , in the future , see the necessity for expansion of steamship interests on both the Atlantic and Pacific under railroad direction . The Canadian Pacific belts the globe , and the United States railroad lines must eventually do the same . It would also be in line with the rising reform in our transportation system to put the Union Pacific back with the Southern Pacific , and then extend the dominion of both to Chicago and the Great Lakes . Steamship rates have a measure of freedom from Washington iegulation , and steamship lines are valuable railroad connections as affording an ideal route for the tourist . The shortest time by ship between New York and Los Angeles by way of the Panama Canal is 15 days . By the Southern Pacific steamship and railroad lines ont 81:i days are required . Non-perishable freight is becoming a larger and more important factor all the time and this is more easily moved by water . Unless the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad were permitted to use Long Island Sound for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for freight can now move on the New Heaven lines only by night , or by Sunday or by express . When the Southern Pacific Line is opened to direct connection with Mexico City in the summer of 1926 , the necessity for steamship expansion of American lines on the Pacific may be emphasized . But at present the Southern Pacific , while having no ownership on the Pacific , does a large and increasing business with the Pacific Mail and other Pacific steamship lines . should be ten million long before the United States doubles in population . OIL IN TEXAS Texas is on sedimentary rocks of sea shell of all ages and has four oil bearing formations , all different from Mexico , and of an area incomparably greater than the oil area about Los Angeles or in the San Joaquin Valley of California . They are now being more scientifically exploited than ever before and " wildcatting " is going out . Oil at Wortham ip 3,000 feet deep and a well was drilled here in less than ten days .

Twelve acres have produced 12,000,000 barrels at West Columbia from a depth of 3,000 feet . Considering the richness of oil territory in Texas and the improvement of modern mechanics and modern science one may look forward to a very rapid development in production and wealth in this state . OIL sCIENCE AND ** 4 Pll A few years ago Texas and California were nearly side by side in oil production at about 100,000,000 barrels each per annum . But during the last three years the new discoveries around Los Angeles doubled the California production to 225,000.000 barrels , while Texas advanced only to 125,000,000 barrels . Yet of the 720,000.000 barrels of oil produced last year in the United States , Texas and Oklahoma produced 277.000.000 and together with Kansas and Louisiana 323,000,000 , or 45$'e of the total United States production , which is 71% of the world 's production , and with Mexico of the world 's production . It will thus be seen that Texas is the center of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of locating oil by the seismograph , heretofore used to measure earthquake distances and vibrations . The Marland Oil Company was the pioneer in the use of this detector . The seismograph is located a mile aw iy from an exploded charge of 500 or a thousand pounds of dynamite and any salt domes give ground resistance , which the seismograph measures . Oil and sulphur are both found under salt domes . The first salt dome located by the seismograph proved its accuracy within twenty feet . Already three salt domes have been thus located . SAN ANTONIO San Antonio with its 40 parks , S7 churches and 07 schools and colleges is ideal in &mate; and balanced population . It is the third city of Texas with 200.000 people as contrasted with 250,000 in Dallas and 211,000 in Houston . One-quarter of its population is Mexican , an element of labor just as important and advantageous for Texas as is the colored labor for Florida 's development .

Here are not only the climate and the prairie fields , but Fort Sam Houston , which had 100,000 soldiers during the war and now holds 10,000 men , and two large government aviation fields with one of 1 the largest hnngars in the world-160 feet long , 170 feet wide and 160 feet high . This is at the Brooks aviation field , where the government maintains about 500 men of whom 200 are students . Let us leave to the domain of mental speculations the possibility of land booms around San Antonio or in Texas . Happily the boundless prairie sets a limit to land booms , and I can see little advantage to any community in enhancing land values under homes and home buildfnes THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name carries one 's idea to California and Texas . 1 am wondering how many people on Manhattan Island know that the Southern Pacific steamship lines are the largest users of New York 's wharf facilities . They occupy 1,670 feet along the river front in the business district and heart of the city . For the accommodation of the Southern Pacific and ? other lines the maritime interests of the Port of New York must steadily move up the Hudson River . We hear much of our decaying Government tonnage , and but little of new steamers put into the American coastwise trade . Thus far this year the Morgan Line of the Southern Pacific has increased its line of steamers from 23 to 25 , putting into service a new luxurious passenger freight steamer the Bienville in January , and launching in February a new freight steamer El Oceano . After the above was written , the Bienville was burned at New Orleans ; fully insured .

Of its three oil tankers one is the third largest in the world . THE SIZE OF rr There were 101 passengers in the Mayflower . There were 101,000 civil servants in the employ of our national government 50 years ago when the demand was imperative for civil service reform lest popular rule be endangered by the army of government employes . The army of Southern Pacific employes now reaches 100,000 . The country grows and a railroad system must expand . When the Steel Corporation was organized it was the first billion dollar corporation on the continent . Today the Southern Pacific is approaching the billion dollar mark .
