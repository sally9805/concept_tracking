When glum pre-Prohibition workers of Pacific Coast Steel Co. first read upon their checks " These pay checks are made non-negotiable so that employes can not cash them in saloons " they knew it was the work of William ( Pigiron ) Piggott , president of the company , bitter and active campaigner against liquor. * Mr. Piggott by the time of his death ( TIME , July 29 ) had built up his Pacific Coast Steel Co. and its subsidiary , Southern California Iron &; Steel Co. , to an annual capacity of 380,000 tons-40,000 more than Columbia Steel , only complete steel unit west of the Rockies , managed then by San Francisco 's powerful Fleishhacker-SIoss interests . <P> Last month United States Steel Corp . absorbed Columbia ( TIME , Nov. 11 ) . Last week Bethlehem Steel 's Eugene Gifford Grace , then in San Francisco , announced his company would acquire Pacific Coast Steel and its subsidiary . <P> Already entrenched on the Pacific Coast through Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp . ' s plants in San Francisco , Alameda and Los Angeles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater rival , U. S. Steel . Open to the competitors lie not only the rich Pacific Coast but the Far East . <P> *Other Piggott campaigning methods included a " Sermon Against Booze " on each pay statement . Typical of these was : " To the married man who thinks he can not get along without his drinks the following is suggested as a solution to the bondage of the habit : " 1 . Start a saloon in your own house . " 2 . Be the only customer and you will have no license to pay . Give your wife $2 to buy a gallon of whiskey and remember that there are 69 drinks to the gallon . " 3 . Buy your drinks from no one but your wife . By the time the first gallon is gone she will have $8 to put in the bank and $2 to start business again . " Should you live 10 years and continue to buy booze from her and then die with snakes in your boots , she will have money enough to bury you decently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry a decent man and quit thinking about you . "
