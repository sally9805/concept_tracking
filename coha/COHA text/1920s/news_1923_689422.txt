txt SULZER ON OKLAHOMA . Former Governor Says He Took the Opposite Course From Gov . Walton . To the Zdttor of The New York Times : As several newspapers have called attention to the supposed analogy of Governor Walton 's case , in Oklahoma , and my case in New York , will you be ' good enough to say for me that there is no analogy . At a conference at the Executive Mansion , in Albany , the evening of Aug. ' 9 , 1913 , my friends advised me to sign a proclamation declaring martial law in Albany County , and instruct the militia to disperse the Assembly because it was about to meet in violation of the Constitution of the State . Suffice it to say that I refused to sign such a proclamation , and said to them , and repeat now : " No man is a greater believer than I am in the supremacy of the law . No man , high or low , rich or poor , is above the law , no matter what he thinks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances . No man must take the law in his own hands . Sooner than sign that proclamation declaring martial law to save my office I will sacrifice the Governorship on the principle that the law is supreme , and every man must bow to its supremacy . " The fact that I was advised the Assembly was to do an unlawful act was no reason why I should take the law in my own hands . If I had to go through now what I did go through in 1913 , I would do today just what I did then ? submit to the civil authorities . WILLIAM SULZER . New York . Oct. 1 , 1923.
