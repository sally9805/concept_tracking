txt Says Allies Have Won at Last . To the Editor of Tht , New York Times : Where are those benevolent , practical authorities who were so loudly anxious to volunteer their self-styled " expert advice " to France and " to determine Germany 's capacity to pay "  --  or not to pay ? Now that foreclosure and reorganization of defaulting Germany are imminent , we are hearing nothing of those plausible slogans and catch-words " stabilization of the mark , " A ' intervention , " " mediation , " " benevolent neutrality , " &c.; Even " French imperialism " and " Black troops on the i ' Rhine " have been shelved or " pied . " The quiet courage and independence of France and her Allies , their dignified tenacity and honorable diplomacy may have served to change the minds of certain types of howling politicians and industrialists who evidently dreamed their ideas about Europe or got their hints from Berlin . The Allies seem to have won the war at long last . HERBERT - FITCH . London , May 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
