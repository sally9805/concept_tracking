" The " Naval Limitations Parley* is developing into an Anglo-American struggle for supremacy . . . . Great Britain 's attitude reveals her wish to remain the foremost naval power . . . . America says , rather hysterically , that . she will never be content with an inferior navy . . . . " <P> The three tart sentences just quoted conveyed last week to readers of the Tokyo news organ Nichi Nichi Shinbun a very clear impression of the situation faced by the Japanese Delegation in Geneva . While the U. S. and Britain " struggled , " how could their strife be turned to good account by Japanese Chief Delegate Viscount Minoru Saito ? Obviously Admiral Viscount Saito ought to cast his influence on one side or the other-after appropriate bargaining . He chose last week the British side . <P> Treaty at Issue . Strife arose because the British insisted on pushing their thesis that the Washington Treaty of 1922 , limiting capital ships of the U. S. , Britain and Japan in the famed 5-5-3 ratio , should be modified or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Chief Delegate , Hugh Simpson Gibson , resisted the British pressure , maintaining that the Parley had been called to extend the 5-5-3 ratio to smaller ships , and not to modify it in any way . Suddenly the Japanese , previously supposed to favor the U. S. position , switched over to support British Chief Delegate the Rt . Hon. William Clive Bridgeman . <P> Saito Keynotes . When newsgatherers were called into the presence of Viscount Saito , they found him amid the homage and the state which befits a man who has recently received the personal mandate of " The Son Of Heaven , " the sublime Tenno ( Emperor ) Hirohito of Japan . Moreover Admiral Saito is now Governor-General of Korea-a post of almost vice-regal dignity . This very rich , potent and shrewd old man read a statement keynoting on two vital points . <P> He said that Japan does not desire to foster the 5-5-3 ratio , but rather considers its implications irritating to her amour propre . " We had not thought , " said Viscount Saito smoothly , " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This first point was in itself a polite negation of U. S. aims at the Parley ; but the second point squarely supported the British thesis , thus : " The British proposal for reducing the size of capital ships and extending the age limit undoubtedly has merit , proving that it will contribute in no small measure toward the diminution of naval expenditures . " <P> U. S. Rebuttal . Chief Delegate Hugh S .. Gibson was so vexed by this Japanese hint of support to the British that he retorted sharply through the press : " The economic situation suggested by Viscount Saito does not arise . It happens that the Washington Treaty expressly provides that no further capital ships are to be laid down until 1931 . Therefore premature discussion here of capital ships could not affect the taxpayers ' burden for armaments . "
