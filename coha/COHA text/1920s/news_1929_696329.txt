In my Inaugural address I offered assurance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the administration " On Dec. 6 , last , Judge James 11. and the general assembly .

" The measures are properly safeguarded by provisions that any ordinances drafted under them must be submitted to a veto of the people before becoming effective . Tho bills do not in themselves settle the traction question and no settlement can be effected until the city council has agreed upon the terms of settlement and the people at a referendum have approved the action of the council .

All Authority Provided . " It is the belief of , the citizens committee and members of the city council that these bills give the city al/ the authority it needs to work out an adequate unification plan , which will provide the most comprehensive and economic transportation system of any large city in the world . " Under their terms the city has the power not only to determine the details of the plan of settlement , but also to regulate operation , rates , and service and the right of purchase by the city , should that be desired , is protected . That authority , properly used , should be of the greatest value in providing for future growth of the metropolis and in giving the people improved transportation facilities at reduced costs .

Technicality Causes Veto . " House bill 513 is vetoed because the amendment it made in the cities and villages act is accomplished by Senator ' bill 484 , which has been signed . " That paragraph of the governor 's statement beginning " The measures are properly safeguarded , " and referring to the referendum requirements in connection with a consolidation ordinance , were heavily underscored in the copies given to too press . During the press conference Gov . Emmerson indicated that tomorrow ho will pass on two other legislative acts of extreme importance to ChicagoTho ; 27,000,000 nen-referendum. bill of the Chicago sanitary district and the increased tax rate for tho Chicago Board of Education , which means approximately ; 35,000,000 increase in taxes during the next two years .

Simpson ' Highly Pleased . " " I am highly pleased , " he said , " to learn that the governor has signed the hills , because they open an opportunity to develop Chicago . I will ask our committee to assemble tomorrow afternoon . I prefer that the committee decide upon any extended comment which may be made . " Aid . talked more freely .

It has been pleaded for years that we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city needs . That reason has been wiped out . Every expert who has advised the city has said that we could not obtain the best possible transportation without a consolidation of the Elevated roads and the surface lines and now under these bills , they can merge . No Excuse for Delay . " The companies are given the power to set up a financial structure which will get them credit on a reasonable basis . They can get the cash with which to make urgent extensions and needed improvements . They now have no reason to stall , sidestep or back up . " The city council can have no excuse for letting the companies get away with procrastination . The city can compel action within a reasonable time . " It these bills mean what I have been led to believe they mean , there is no reason why there should not be fair play on both sides .

" Plan Program First . The alderman said that he desired to talk with a number of his colleagues before announcing a tentative program . He thought last night that the first session of the committee would probably be devoted to formulating program . the representatives of the companies to be called in later . He added : " There will be no delay , if I can prevent P .. You may be sure of that . " ' The Mita signed yesterday are the culmination of contests in the last three sessions of the legislature ? at least , that is true of the terminable permit act . ' The first bill authorizing an indeterminate franchise in Illinois was presented to the general assembly In 1925 by Senator Richard .1 , Barr pf Joliet . The protests were so strong against that bill that it was withdrawn without a vote . A legislative commission was appointed to investigate this form of franchise and report , The report was tiled with the 1927 session . At the general assembly the companies presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was so weighted down with amendments in the house that it was left to die . At the session just closed the terminable permit bill , sponsored by the citizens ' committee and indorsed by the city council passed both houses overwhelmingly . The companion bills , permitting the companies to consolidate , increasing the powers of the city to build subways and conferring home rule over transit matters , also received large favorable votes . But the legislation half a longer history than attaches to the terminable permit crusade . When the 20 year , franchise of the surface lines had run about half its term , the companies and city officials decided that a consolidation of both surface and elevated roads was the best practical way to , improve the local transit facilities . The Parsons-Arnold-Ridgeway investigation at that time recommended that course . To accomplish that end , It was proposed to have a consolidation under a trustee system and an ordinance on that policy was submitted to the voters for approval in 1918 . It was defeated . Dever Ordinance Defeated . That next serious effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal ownership with an operating control in the hands of men selected by public officials . That plan was shelved by a majority of 105,000 votes . Then started the crusade for a corporate consolidation of the transit companies , to which merged company should be given a terminable permit . The public regulatory control was to be vested in a local utility commission . That scheme did not really get started , although discussed and kicked about for a long time , until last autumn . The aldermen decided that they wanted an ordinance before asking for bvading legislation to make it effective , ' The , companies wanted the enabling legislation first , but pretended to discuss an ordinance with the aldermen until it looked like tht time left before the legislature convened was insufficient in which to reach an agreement . Wilkerson Group to Rescue . Wien into the picture stepped Judge James H. Wilkerson of the U. S. dieblot court , which had appointed a receiver for the Chicago Railways company . He appointed a citizens ' committee consisting of James Simpson , Col. A. A. Sprague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles M. Thompson . They undertook the job of ironing out the differences between the companies and the city . They turned out sLx bills , agreed to by both sides , The city council indorsed these billa , but insisted upon presenting a seventh Mil . Gov . Emmerson suggested an eighth . The Citizens ' committee has asserted that these bills give the companies all the power they need and the city more authority than it had Previously requested . How the power will be utilized is the second chapter in the story . BISHOP CANNON A STOCK PLAYER WHO LOST OUT New York , June 19 . ?
