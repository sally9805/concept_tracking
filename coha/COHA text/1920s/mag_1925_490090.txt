Our National Hero ANICE New York lady with fluffy hair cried into her teacup when her afternoon paper an-. nounced that Gerald Chapman was to be hanged for murder . She said almost any woman could love this ratty little man , whose known history is a catalogue of the more reprehensible crimes , whose probable use for the women he knows is the cadet 's and who , when he looks into any human face , does so with startling eyes of a blow-torch blue in which is the expression of humble hatred found in a small animal at bay . New York men , too , showed a sympathy for the justly sentenced killer . It was a sympathy so frank and general that editors of New York newspapers , analyzing it , have unanimously chosen to console the reading public with hopeful predictions that Chapman , before the June day on which his neck is to he broken , will find a way to escape from the death yard in the prison at Wethersfield , Connecticut . Every reason for this popular sympathy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , which is that killing a cop is not quite generally regarded as murder . New York would be satisfied if , for beating an armed New Britain constable to the draw , the State of Connecticut had imposed on Chapman a good sized fine accompanied , perhaps , by a severe reprimand from the bench . The Hartford jury which convicted Chapman could have taken the popular point of view and could legally have chosen any one of three penalties less than the one of death . Their reasons for not doing so were founded in things having little to do with the guilt or innocence of Chapman . The verdict was a fair one , but it wasreached by judicial processes that were unobjective from start to finish . You do not have to go so far as Dubuque to find a definite hatred of New York and things from New York . In Connecticut there is a very lively detestation of the loud and happy neighbor down the Sound . People from New York , to mention only one Corniceticut grievance , rush through the tidy little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath and the speed laws . This breeds no great affection . State Prosecutor Hugh Alcorn , when he got Chapman away from a Federal prison and delivered him over to Connecticut justice , gave his fellow townsmen a brilliant opportunity to rebuke , in the person of one of its most famous citizens , the Babylon beyond the Boundary . Of that opportunity , Alcorn and congratulating brother puritans proceeded to take full advantage . The Hon. Newell Jennings , who presided over the trial , had been Alcorn 's assistant in the prosecutor 's office until , mainly through Alcorn 's influence , he was promoted to the bench . In any panel of veniremen , there were sure to be many men who , during Alcorn 's eighteen years of State office and Hartford practice , had made with him some litigious contact teaching them either to respect or fear his great local power . Alcorn , who is allowed by law to continue private practice while in public office , handles thousands of suits against the great insurance companies of Hartford and every one of the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcorn further improved his chances by preparing a good circumstantial case and clinched victory when he begged the jury to protect New England against the bloody outlander who had dared to intrude with his criminal projects into the puritan peace of their countryside  --  yes , " even into the shadow of the humble birthplace of our beloved president . " It was perhaps the prosecutor 's specious reference to Mr. Coolidge which finally reduced Chapman 's chances to zero . But other things helped . On the bench , Judge Jennings took a great dislike to the New York newspapermen who crowded the press space in his court and , after the manner of their kind , made it untidy . The shingled female representative of a Manhattan picture paper disturbed his sense of the fitness of august things . He allowed it to he understood that he would watch her closely for any sign of levity . The young lady showed none . She , too , cried bitterly when sentence on Chapman was pronounced . WHEN the verdict was given , the jury celebrated the Connecticut triumph with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could eat one more meal at the expense of the State , they each achieved the herculean feat of consuming $5 worth of food at a Hartford hotel , the lunch ending on two helpings of pie all around . It may not please us of New York that the circumstances which made virtuous Alcorn champion of Connecticut also made infamous Gerald the knight of Manhattan . We may regret that our colors are so often carried abroad by the Nicky Arnsteins . . . But the thought of Chapman 's worthy conduct under legal fire should he some consolation to our civic pride . In the days before he took the stand to state his own case in language which shamed the grammar of his questioners , Chapman , the illiterate , read Conrad 's " Lord Jim . " He may have been struck by the similarity of his plight to that of Jim , trying to explain to the Admiralty justice the inexplicable . He , too , had to tell of things that none could understand . Why a man must steal because he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hunted and why he must end on a gallows things begun in a reform school  --  this he understood , but could not relate . One felt that , with each eloquent word he spoke , he became more unintelligible to twelve proper men ; with each good sentence he formed he was more disliked by twelve indifferent parsers . They will hang our New York bad man , quite rightly . ONE thing is hard to believe about Gerald Chapman . And that is Chapman 's more than movie-star eagerness to pose for the press photographers in profile , close-up , with his lawyers , his beloved Conrad books , and his favorite cigar stubs . There was the dismal day , thus , when Chapman was arrested in New York with " Dutch " Anderson and a few others for the million-dollar postal robbery . Manacled to a detective , Chapman strode out of Police Headquarters after being properly fingerprinted , and ran into the omnipresent photographers . He balked at posing , trying to shield his face with his straw hat . The photographers pleaded with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lest they fail to catch the last edition . " I wo n't do it , " said Chapman , quite meekly . " You wo n't , hey ! " declared his braceleted companion . " Why , you ( here insert a line from a current play ) if you do n't look right at that camera , I 'll plant this fist in your ( another line ) jaw ! " And that 's how Chapman learned to pose . Mr. Hearst Retires WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST is slipping into retirement . The handwriting has long been on the wall . As yet the retirement is not absolute and it will not be absolute , in all probability , until this world knows Hearst as a name only . But the master , nevertheless , is definitely passing out of the active picture in the Hearst publications . Last fall Mr. Hearst went to his ranch at San Simeon , California . At the time it was said aroundhis offices and among his executives that he was to spend a month or two in the West . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said that he would be back in New York by Christmas , or in January at the latest . In December he sent for Joseph Moore , official holder of the Hearst money bags . Moore went West and talked with his boss . When he returned , and overnight , Hearst 's International Magazine was no more . It was consolidated , retaining the best features of both , with Cosmopolitan . And then Hearst 's name disappeared from the mast head of the New York Zmerican , and Moore 's appeared instead , as president of the organization . These two incidents may seem trivial . First , a magazine consolidation , which was good business , for Hearst 's was taking circulation away from Cosmopolitan , and second , the Hearst name dropping out of the New York iirnerican . But for many years it had been understood that , come what might , Hearst wanted his name on the magazine covers , no matter if he lost thousands of dollars thereby . Hearst 's International was expected to exist as long as Hearst survived this orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Hearst name on the label . Then , too , he had Norman Hapgood as editor , and under Hapgood 's regime , Hearst 's International went to a circulation figure of 500,000 and more  --  for the first time in its history . The New York American has always been the paper that Hearst has personally directed . When he lived in New York , every edition , as it rolled from the presses , was sent to his Riverside Drive apartment , and later to the Ritz , by office boy . He would remake the editions , from time to time , by telephone . The American was the one Hearst paper that Hearst ran himself . That he was not very successful with it in a financial way has an obvious cause  --  every man he tired of elsewhere he assigned to the American , and some heavy salaries were and still are carried on its pay rolls . And now his name has been dropped from that paper . He asked Norman Hapgood to become editor of the American after the consolidation of Hearst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Hapgood occupies a little office in the American building in William Street  --  the kind of office spoken of as a dungeon in the Hearst service . rTEARST has informed those close to him that from now on he intends to spend most of his time in California . He has been there continuously since last Fall , ( a long visit for the nervous Mr. Hearst ) , and he intends to stay there . Trips will probably be made East , of course , but they will be short trips , and more for inspection than anything else . Just now when he wants any of his editors he sends for them . This does not displease them , for they achieve thereby a trip to California , and a week or two at San Simeon . Then back they come to their posts in the East , Middle West or South . The real , active Hearst management has been left to the aforesaid Moore , who now runs the magazines and newspapers . Ray Long and Arthur Brisbane handle the editorial end for these two branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save for the news reel , are now being disposed of , along with Marion Davies 's contracts . The movies have been a far from profitable field for the publisher . It was only a few years ago that Hearst started to enlarge his string of papers . Seattle , Baltimore , Fort Worth and San Antonio publications were added to his already extensive possessions . There have been no recent acquisitions , however , and the various Hearst papers have been told to keep expenses down and save and make money . A reign of economy and efficiency is setting in . Mrs. Hearst , it is said , will remain in New York , where she has been giving large parties this season . The Riverside Drive apartments of the Hearsts were remodeled and redecorated more than a year ago , but Hearst has not lived there since When work first started , he moved to the Ritz , leaving it only for California . Mr. Hearst retires to San Simeon and its vast acres , with only the expense accounts of his editors whom hesends fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? he is sixty-two , ? and he feels that his time to play has arrived . . . . Tea and Things THE most recent British conspiracy against the hurly-burly of American business life has terminated with the departure of Sir Charles Iligham , This sleekly attired , pudgy Englishman , regarded as the foremost advertising man in his country , is determined that we shall no longer be denied an understanding of the blessings of tea . Sir Charles is a tea missionary , and he does n't care whose tea is drunk , providing it is British tea . A missionary should be a good fellow , and the jolly group that nightly congregated around Sir Charles 's table in the smoking room of the Leviathan west hound had no reason to be disappointed in the good fellowship of their host . He did n't carry his enthusiasm for tea to the point where more animating fluids were excluded . During this voyage across , however , Sir Charles experienced twenty-four hours of acute unpopularity . As is customary , the pool speculators congregated to vote on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Leviathan had been making good time : 616 knots the first day , 600 the second and 6oi the third , but with a rougher sea and some head wind there was some belief among the smoking room sea dogs that the next day 's run would not go beyond 590 . At any rate , there were strong arguments advanced to have the numbers from 591 to 610 auctioned off , but Sir Charles insisted that the numbers be 595 to 614 . He had the advantage of organization for , while the others who urged a lower starting number for the pool were scattered , Sir Charles had many friends . Whether the suspicion was just or unjust , there was a disturbed feeling among those outside the Sir Charles circle that the whole scheme had been cut and dried . It had all the appearance of a low Yankee trick . Naturally , the bidding would be keenest for " low field " which means , as all good smoking room sailors know , that if the ship 's run is less than the number of knots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidder in of " low field " will win the pot . And , as it was generally believed that it was a part of Sir Charles 's plan to obtain " low field , " the bidding for all of the numbers was light , but they forced him up to $25o for his " low field " ticket . There were no sad faces the following day at noon when the ship 's run was posted and it was found that 598 had won . The winner , who was not a member of the Sir Charles circle , collected his profits , which included Sir Charles 's $250 and the other minor amounts which he had bid in on unlucky numbers . At this point , the Englishman was unpopular . It was announced that Sir Charles would be the pool auctioneer for the next day 's run . He made a gallant come-back . He not only proved to he a suave and humorous merchandiser of numbers , but whenever he came to one of his own he forced the bidding to such an extent that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure than was warranted by previous sales . Yesterday was forgotten , and Sir Charles again presided at his popular tea table . VOU may , if you have ten dollars and receive an I invitation , become a member of the Embassy Club of New York , and so become eligible to attend the nightly functions of the Embassy Club of London should you run over for the season this Summer . It might , however , be better to postpone your trip across until next year , because then the Prince will have returned from South Africa . Invitations are being sent these gay Spring mornings to a carefully selected list of persons ; that is to say , to most persons owning town residences not situated in Brownsville or the Bronx . They are put5 out over some impressive names , including that of the affable Messmore Kendall . There are , to be sure , others  --  thus , Lawrence S. Butler , Frank Hitchcock , Alexander Duer Irving , Robert McBride , Walter S. Andrews Jr. , Bradford Norman , Jr. , Paul Phelan , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Embassy Club has acquired for its home the building at 695 Fifth Avenue , which is being done over to furnish the members with card rooms , mah jongg rooms ( although this last seems a waste of space ) ; a beauty parlor , if that is what is meant by the salon de beauti ; suites for private affairs and various dining rooms . Luncheon , tea , dinner and supper will be served , with music designed to inspire those energetic movements known at present as dancing . When the Embassy Club opens formally , it is believed that Mr. Michael Arlen will be invited to attend , if he survives Hollywood . When he writes his inevitable novel of New York 's charming people , it is hoped , he will do as well by the local exquisites as he did by the Trevors and Shelmerdcnes of London ; remembering , of course , that what is a drink in London is an adventure in New York .                  @ @ @
