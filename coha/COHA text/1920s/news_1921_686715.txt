txt The passage and signing of the joint resolution declaring the state of war with Germany ended fell flat in this country . There was not the slightest sign of public enthusiasm or even interest . And in Germany , too , accord- ing to the dispatches in THE TIMES , not a particle of excitement was evident . Both nations remained , like the little girl friend of Sir WALTER SCOTT , " most unusual calm . " The reason lies on the surface . In Germany as clearly as in the United States the people and public men understand that the peace resolution , gets us nowhere except to state the fact that hostilities have ceased . This was admitted in the Senate by e. strong advocate of the resolution , Senator Bassaiscez . He said : " The only effect of this resolution is to " say that we are at peace , when the " previous declaration of Congress " said we were at war . " The Conifecticut Senator put the matter even more bluntly when he asserted that the resolution " simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 --  without a declaration ever since the 44-armistice . " This being so , there is obviously in the resolution nothing to throw anybody into paroxysms of joy . . f-There is a question , however , to be concerned about , and that is , " What next ? " Next there must be a treaty With Germany . The only way to seCure to the United States the " rights , privileges , indemnities , reparations 41 or advantages " of which the peace resolution speaks is by effective treaty agreements . There is no dispute about this . Senator BRANDEGEE conceded that the resolution could give no instructions to the Executive . The President and his Secretary of State May negotiate any sort of treaty they please . It is generally expected , of Course , that an attempt will be made ' 4 , i , treaty to secure all American lights . But Germany will be free to deal with our demands as she sees fit . The question was put direct to Mr. &L; kNDEGEE whether the second part of the resolution , about compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His frank answer was : " I do not think it has . " Of course it Has n't . And if Germany were to refiise to give in a treaty the guarantees which this country will insist upon , what would be left for us to do ? Apparently , nothing but to declare war ikon her again and compel her to yield . - Thus what we come down to in this great Republican achievement of the peace resolution is an empty gesture . It settles nothing . It makes only the more difficult the problems that must be settled . Senator POMERENE of Ohio made a comparison which Is pointed and not unfair : Suppose my good friend Senator KNox in the days of his active practice of the law had sent a law clerk out to settle a lawsuit involving a thousand different causes of action , he representing the plaintiff , and the defendant had one cause of action that he was particularly interested in , and the clerk came back , and the Senator said : " Did you settle ? " And the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Which one ? " " The one the defendant wanted to settles ' " Are the others unsettled ? " " Yes . " " Why did you not settle them ? " " I thought we would ' let those remain until a later day . " That law clerk would not remain very long in Senator KNox 's law office . Meanwhile , the Senate could not get away from the fact that all these vexing ' and unsettled questions between the United States and Germany have been dealt ! with comprehensively and satisfactorily in what President HARDING calls " the existing Treaty , " under which he informed Congress that he thought it would be " the wiser course " to " engage . " All those matters of reparation , alien property , seizures of ships , &c.,; involve nice questions of international law , Private as well as public , and economics . They were wrestled with for months at Paris by the greatest experts in law and in finance that could be assembled . And yet , as Senator WALsii of Montana complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the res " olution before us without the " slightest contemplation " of the difficulties that were fought through at the Peace Congress . Say what they the Republican Senators know that there must be a treaty with Germany . In their hearts they are aware that the Versailles Treaty is better than any new one that could be negotiated . And they live in fear of what Senator BRANDEGEE called the " untoward event " of the Versailles Treaty being again submitted ' . to the Senate . The present indications are strong that Secretary HUGHES will advise that this be done . He has described himself as " counsel for the United States . " As such it is his duty to assert and secure the rights of his client in the most complete way possible . And if this , in his deliberate opinion , is to be found in a modified Versailles Treaty , do the Senate snarlers imagine that the country would for a moment uphold them against him ?                 @ @ @ @
