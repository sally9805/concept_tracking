Drown , chairman of the Hoover Ohio comraittee . Under the Ohio law , a. candidate must give pis consent to the use of his name , but that is as far as Secretary Hoover plans to go for the pres. ent at least . He will not undertake to discuss campaign issues , nor will he take the stump in Ohio or elsewhere during the pre-convention campaign . He will remain in the Coolidge cabinet attending to his duties and will resign only if he is nominated at Kansas City . Hoover Letter to Brown , The letter ' to Mr. Brown follows : " I have received , through you and others , . requests from very . many Republicans of Ohio that I permit my name to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . " I shall be deeply honored by what . lever support the people of Ohio may decide to give me at the Republican national convention . I shall be glad to serve the American people through the Republican party in any way that I can in finding constructive solution to the many problems which confront our country . " My conviction that I should not strive for the nomination and my obligations as secretary of commerce preclude , me from making any personal campaign . I must rely wholly upon my friends in Ohio to conduct it and to conduct it in a fair manner and with steadfast regard for Repub. lican success in the state and the noHon . It is my special desire that expenditure of money shall be strictly limited and rigidly accounted for . Carry on Coolidge 's Policies . " If the greatest trust which can be gives by our people should come to me , I should consider it my duty to carry forward the principles of the Republican party and the great objectives of President Coolidge 's policies ? all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness , progress , and security . " With one-third of the prospective delegates lined up , Mr. Hoover seems certain to start off in the convention balloting in the lead . The convention will be made up of 1,080 delegates and 545 will be necessary for the nom . Motion . Estimates of the initial IlooNer strength run from 325 to 375 , without counting such states as New York and Pennsylvania , In which the delegates likely are to be uninstructed but which may be swung to Hoover , The Hoover supporters feel assured that their candidate will be well ahead of his most formidable rival , Frank 0 . Lowden , for whom 250 or more votes have been claimed on the first The plan of the Hoover board of strategy is to enter nine or ten of the seventeen primary states . The Ohio primary may be the only one in which Mr. Hoover opposes a favor- ' ite son candidate . He will remain out of the primary in Illinois , the home state of former GOV . Lowden , and in Indiana where Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoover and Lowden to Clash , Whether Hoover and Lowden will oppose each other for delegates in any primary states is uncertain . The Hoover people have no present intention of invading the Dakotas or Nebraska where Lowden is conceded to have the advantage . In one or two primary states where Hoover has the inside track , such as Maryland , there is talk that Lowden may be entered The Hoover and Lowden forces are certain to clash in a number of states where nominations are to be made by conventions . Ten primary states in which Hoever may be a candidate have a total of 324 delegates . These include , however , Pennsylvania , which will not be entered it Secretary of the Treasury Mellon prefers that the delegation shall be uninstructed , and Massachusetts , which will be let alone if Gov . Fuller , who has expressed himself as favor . Ing Hoover , decides to allow his name to be used as a favorite son candidate . Pennsylvania has 79 delegates and Massachusetts 39 .

Expects to Win in California . Secretary Hoover 's friends expect to have little or no opposition in his home state of California ; in Oregon , in Michigan , in New Jersey , in New Hampshire , and probably in Maryland , unless Lowden becomes a factor there . They also regard conditions as favor able in West Virginia , although Senator Goff is talked of as a possible favorite son candidate .
