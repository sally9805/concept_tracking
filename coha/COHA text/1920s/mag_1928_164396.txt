An elegant express train rolled southward last week carrying Candidate Smith to Biltmore , social suburb of Asheville , N. C. , for a week of rest mixed with golf and not voluntarily with politics . <P> Cities north of Washington are accustomed to elegant express trains carrying distinguished statesmen . Not until the Smith train entered Virginia did real crowds begin to appear on station platforms . At Charlottesville , though it was getting late , Candidate Smith went out on the back platform and made a bow . <P> " Come on down here , Governor , and put your foot on Virginia soil , " cried a man . The candidate descended and let a flagman shine a lantern in his face so that the Virginians could see what he looked like . The light gleamed on his gold fillings . The Virginians cheered . <P> The next appearance was at Old Fort , N. C. , where it looked as though Candidate Smith might make a speech . But George W. Sandlin , the local orator , got into action first , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All aboard . " <P> At Biltmore , the Candidate stood up in an automobile and said he was glad to be there . He told his five thousand or so welcomers how busy he had been , governing New York-an amiable , spontaneous yet perfunctory speech until the last sentence . Then , slily combining his oldtime East Side accent with the local vernacular , he said : " I hope to meet yez-all personally before I leave . " The North Carolinans cheered . <P> Sedulously dodging large functions , sticking closely to the golf course , the Candidate did find time to drop in at the local firehouse . " Hello , boys . What 's the chance of a fire ? " he said , and told them he was a volunteer fireman himself , at home . He also entered a bakery to pay compliments on a cake . The local press did not overlook these matters . <P> The outstanding property of the Smith trip was a brown derby hat . That is the Smith insignium . Asheville haberdashers caught the idea quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as " copper war helmets . " In Manhattan , seeking to find out where the original Brown Derby was bought , newsgatherers found no less than three hatters claiming the honor-Knox , Young and Truly Warner . The Knox company said that Candidate Smith purchased four or five of its hats per annum . All hatters look forward to a boom year , not even counting election bets . <P> From Spokane came unexpected news that the Washington Democrats , in state convention , had instructed their Houston delegation to cast all 14 votes for Candidate Smith . Senator Dill , previously opposed to Candidate Smith , remained silent during the session . <P> From Iowa came news that Candidate Meredith , whom Candidate Smith was reported to have trounced at county conventions last fortnight , disputed the Smith victory and scented a " plot . " In the U. S. Senate up stood James Thomas ( " Tom Tom " ) Heflin , who mortally hates and fears the Roman Pope , and denounced the Smith campaign fund as the " most corrupt ever used in a Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said : " I want to get Jimmy Walker first . He is the slickest eel in the pond . " Mayor Walker of New York ignored Senator Heflin . From Iowa came the Smith men 's report of expenses : about $1 per precinct .
