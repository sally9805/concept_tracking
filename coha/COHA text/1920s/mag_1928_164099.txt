Cholera , furiously fatal intestinal disease , is as old as populated India ; and until 1817 never left the home grounds . In that year it spread East ; with the increase of travel in later years it spread West , invading the Americas in 1826 and 1873 . The great pandemic of 1879 to 1883 threw a scare into the civilized world , sent scientists to microscope and test tube , sent Robert Koch* into Egypt from which he emerged with the Vibrio cholerae , cause of all the trouble . Work on the troublesome organism has not ceased since that time . During the last epidemic the British Government appointed Dr. Felix d'Herelle , world renowned bacteriologist , head of a special mission to India to study cholera . Last month he returned to Paris victorious . The bacteriophage** which is liberated by Vibrio cholerae , discovered by d'Herelle in 1917 , had eradicated the disease and immunized the population of large areas . <P> With characteristic biologic modesty , the cholera bacteriophage had been at work long before it was discovered and named . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a village in India has remained free from cholera while the epidemic raged around it . These patients had an abundance of bacteriophages in the intestines , probably because the village drinking water had been accidentally contaminated by the bacteriophages . Dr. d'Herelle systematized these coincidences . He prepared cultures of the bacteriophage from the stools of convalescent patients , transferred 30 to 40 cubic centimetres of the culture to every well in the district , administered several cubic centimetres by mouth to all sufferers repeatedly . The bacteriophage feeds on the living matter to which it is accustomed . Therefore the cultures in the wells ate up all the cholera organisms , purifying the drinking water ; the cultures administered by mouth destroyed all the cholera germs in the intestines , healing the sick . Even in grave cases where the patients were already moribund the mortality was cut down phenomenally . Sixty-two per cent of the cases that were not treated died , whereas only 8 per cent of the treated cases succumbed . <P> Cholera strikes suddenly . Intense thirst is followed by acute cramps and collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the collapse the face turns black , the skin becomes dry and hard , the voice fades . Early and extreme rigidity of the corpse is a striking feature of cholera and the origin of much superstition . Frequently the corpse will sit bolt upright on the stretcher as it is being carried to the morgue , or rise on its cot at home . <P> <P> *German bacteriologist , 1834-1910 . <P> **Bacteriophage-a living by-product of the development of bacteria which has the power of destroying the bacteria when they reach a certain concentration ( TIME , Aug. 30 , 1926 ) . The bacteriophage of bacillary dysentery has been employed by the Oswaldo-Cruz Institute in Brazil to eradicate bacillary dysentery in that country .
