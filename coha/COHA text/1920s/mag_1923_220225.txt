George Harvey , American Ambassador , made a speech at a Pilgrims ' dinner in London . He said that America had never asked Britain to guarantee money lent to the other Allies , and he repudiated Lord Balfour 's contention ( note to the Allied Powers on War Debts , Aug. 1 , 1922 ) that the United States Government had so insisted " in substance , if not in form . " Not content with having made a useless diplomatic blunder , Mr. Harvey was willing to prove it ; for he implied that the British Government would withdraw the " unfortunate allusions " made by Lord Balfour six months ago . <P> The War Debt owed by Britain to America has been settled . The British Government has decided not to rake up the ashes of the past and thus prolong a futile discussion . Harvey 's remarks will therefore go ignored .
