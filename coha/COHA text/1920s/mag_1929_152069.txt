Before You 're 25 . " If a man is n't a socialist sometime before he 's 25 , " says Playwright Kenyon Nicholson , " he has no heart . If he is a socialist after he 's 25 he has no head . " In this Nicholson play , Clement Corbin , son of a wealthy Chicagoan , has a heart , a radical magazine called The Torch , a baby born en route through Indiana , the baby 's mother , no marriage certificate . He is a determined socialist . How his family and would-be wife combine to make him marry and drop The Torch for a furniture house-organ , is developed in somewhat strained comedy . In searching for laughs Playwright Nicholson has lost the convincing humanity which characterized The Barker . Eric Dressier , Mildred McCoy play the leads . <P> The Love Duel . It would save a great deal of translating if English-writing dramatists could learn of the debonair didos that presumably occur in Vienna and Budapest after the curtains are drawn . But to most English-writing dramatists sex remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravaganza . Therefore central Europe is combed for playwrights akin to the gently libidinous Ferenc Molnar . One of the latest combings is Lili Hatvany , authoress of The Love Duel . <P> The play itself would cause no exultation . But Ethel Barrymore acts the part of the jaded lovelady of Budapest who meets a sleek male counterpart . Ensues a mutual struggle against sentiment . Even in Budapest it is difficult not to care for the person with whom one has an affair , so after the child is born , a tremulous surrender to the exigencies and joys of affection occurs high in a Swiss chalet . This cycle of repression and catharsis is endowed with the mysteries of personality and feeling by Actress Barrymore , statuesquely assisted by Louis Calhern . <P> The Camel Through the Needle 's <P> Eye by Czech Surgeon-Playwright Frantisek Langer is the last production of the eleventh Theatre Guild season . It is a success story in the mid-European idiom . Alik is the silent , dawdling son of a millionaire . All that he subsequently becomes , his redemption from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Susi . Naturally , since Alik is Continental , Susi is not his wife . Possessing the shrewdness of the slums , she manages , when Alik 's father ousts her from Alik 's modernistic chambers , to take Alik away with her , to make him work . Together they found a model dairy in Prague . Dispelling U. S. qualms , their marriage looms . <P> Elliot Cabot and Miriam Hopkins play the lovers . But their ardors are scarcely as exciting as the tart philosophizing of old Mrs. Pesta , a female shard , played by Helen Westley of the Guild Board of Directors . Director Westley has acted in 37 of the Guild 's 70 productions . As the mother of Susi she makes the first act so brilliant that the last two are inevitably the worse for her longer absence from the stage .
