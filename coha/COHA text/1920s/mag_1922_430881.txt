 | TO understand any ancient literature , and the Old Testament more especially , it is important to guard against the error that myth , legend , and tradition are not true . Truth being as much in idea as in concrete fact , they are often the only forms in which it can be conveyed . A myth , long transmitted , can distil into fable form primitive ideas as to religion , as to the origin of the world , as to the separation of the races , as to the rise of social institutions , because in no other shape could they so easily be condensed . A legend is no more than the enlargement into a tale , easily told and remembered , of events for the most part historical in essence . Tradition is the unwritten history of mankind . It passes from father to son , from country to country , working itself out in custom , speech , manners , law , and ways of thinking . Tradition is the element which welds the generations and the peoples into something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one force , it holds the world together ; To say that the earlier portion of the Scriptures makes use of myth , legend , and tradition is in no way to invalidate its power of transmitting truth . Except in these forms the broken memories of the prehistoric and the barely historic could hardly have been summed up . It must not be forgotten that to man 's discovery of God , and God 's revelation of Himself , external facts are not of the first importance . If the spirit of them can be given , the necessary has been done . The one theme which the Bible develops consistently , even if unconsciously , is man 's relationship to God , and to that external facts are only incidental . Through the working together of all the means at the chronicler 's command @#  | we have seen Man and Woman ? otherwise the human race ? starting on their upward climb at the moment when they have discerned the difference between right and wrong . The idea of God is as yet elemental , though fraught with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow through the ages . It grew slowly and irregularly . It flourished here ; it wilted there . Materialism was against it , as it always is . In the very first stages materialism , personified as Cain , rose up against the spiritual idea , personified as Abel , and slew it . The spiritual eemed already dead . At an early period the world belonged apparently to the seed of Cain . " And Cain knew his wife , and she conceived and bare Enoch . And he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son , Enoch . And unto Enoch was born Irad ; Irad begat Mehujael ; and Mehujael begat Mehushael ; and Mehushael begat Lamech . And Lamech took unto him two wives ; the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other was Zillah . And Adah bare Jabal ; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle . And his brother was Jubal ; he was the father of all such as handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare Tubal-cain , the forger of every cutting instrument of copper and iron . " Under these names , some of them uncouth to us , we must see ' more than individuals in a line of descent ; we must understand generations , peoples , movements , tendencies , and the whole upward surging of the race . It was undoubtedly a period in which great things were being done . Merely to have worked out of the Stone Age into the Iron Age was a long stride in progress . To have discovered the arts was a longer stride . The dividing of population between those who live in cities and those who dwell in tents and have cattle ? the manufacturing and the pastoral classes ? is along the specialized lines Which civilization follows . Nothing accomplished in the twentieth century is worthier of the struggle upward than the efforts made by primitive men to raise themselves . It will be-noted that this is material development only . But the spiritual idea which seemed dead in Abel came to a new birth in Seth , and grew again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attack . Direct onslaught having failed to kill it , inner perversion was tried , and tried not unsuccessfully . The line of Seth corrupted itself . The God who could come to regret what He had done regretted it . " And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually . And it repented Jehovah that he had made manon the earth , and it grieved him at his heart . And Jehovah said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground ; both man and beast , and creeping things , and birds of the heavens , for it repenteth me that I have made them . But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah . " The Flood , which in the Babylonian legend came through the rising of rivers , and in the Hebrew through rain , was doubtless some catastrophe in which the ancient mind read the kind of lesson as to moral consequence which some of us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the primitive form of expression . Corruption seeming to call for punishment , that punishment was seen as the wrath of an angry God . A God subject to violent fits of passion is a concept easy to the elemental and ignorant , who are subject to the same . The Creator who repented that He had made man , and who was grieved at His heart over His mistake , would naturally break out into threatenings and slaughters . Let it be remembered here that any seeming misconception is verbal rather than actual , If Evil wars against Good , Good must also war against Evil . It is the continuance of the struggle in which the serpent wounds man 's heel , and man crushes the serpent 's head . God 's forces are on man 's side and on that of ultimate victory . If He is represented as " angry , " it is only because the thought and phrase of three and four thousand years ago were less nicely adapted than those of today to the ideal of God as unchangeably of Love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible are of extreme antiquity . In them are embodied man 's first gropings after that All-Tender Universal which we have not completely realized ourselves , but toward which we are on the way . The angry God , the jealous God , the remorseful God , of the Old Testament are but the terins of man 's imperfect understanding , dropping into disuse in proportion as God is discovered as dynamic , unvarying Good-will . The point to be noticed in these early pages of the Scriptures is the conflict between the material and the spiritual standards . Now the one , now the other , seems to triumph . While the idea of God remains elemental , it nevertheless tends to ' purify itself as time goes on . Then , as the mists enshrouding the early eons begin to lift , one great figure , in whom the spiritual impulses which strain forward are blended and exemplified , emerges dimly but colossally . " Terah begat Abram , Nahor , and Haran ; and Haran begat Lot . And Haran died before his father Terah in the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terah took Abram his son , and Lot , the son of Haran , his son 's son , and Sarai his daughter-in-law , his son Abram 's wife , and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan . And they came unto Haran and dwelt there . " These were the days of great migrations . How far these names represent the movements of individuals only , or of whole tribes under the leadership of individuals , is now obscure . From a point a little north of the Persian Gulf they journeyed up the greater part of the length of the Euphrates into the rich plain between that river and the Tigris , then known as Padan-Aram , now called Mesopotamia , and there came to a halt . In that lush @#  | country , to which Hebrew legend always looked back as the Garden of Eden , the starting-point of the human race , the vision of man widened its outlook upon God , seeing Him as beyond any of man 's speculations hitherto . What Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others can not now , of course , be known . It is certain that he was not alone in his spiritual striving . Scattered here and there were men and women as eager then as they are today to get out of the stagnancy of merely accepted assumptions and to find God for themselves . Discoveries of any kind , as we often have opportunities to observe , come through a timetendency. - Abraham was the spokesman of his era . Summing up its aspirations in himself , he carries them to point to which no one of his contemporaries was seemingly prepared to go . The Call two Canaan After the God of hopes and fears , of jealousies and distrusts , which the early pages of Genesis portray to us , it is like coming on a higher order of existence to read the call in which Abraham feels the urge to leave PadanAram and push on into the unknown . The tone becomes unexpectedly more mature , the language nobler . Though God still shows traces of the vindictiveness which man recognized in himself , the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . It is probable that no such ideal could have been formed earlier . The illumination in this man 's inner life was great enough , not only to impart the sense of a consecrated mission , but to make him to all the future the vehicle of Good-will . " Now Jehovah said unto Abraham , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred . and from thy father 's house , unto the land that I will show thee . And I will make of thee a great nation . And I will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and be thou a blessing ! And I will bless them that bless thee , and him that curseth thee will I curse . And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed . So Abraham went forth as Jehovah had spoken unto him . And they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came . " Why Canaan ? Why not Padan-Aram , or Ur of the Chaldees ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and speech that its significance is worth noticing . Making all allowance for those explanations after the fact which mark so much of early history , the destiny of the Hebrew people seems , from their first development out of a family into a tribe , and out of a tribe into a nation , to have been linked with this south-east corner of the Mediterranean litoral . And , as a matter of fact , there we find civilization 's focal point for perhaps three thousand years . All the great empires which rose and fell turned round and round about it . Situated between the two river powers of the very ancient world , that of the Nile and that of the Euphrates , it was open to the influence of both . With the sea as a highway to Greece 1 and Rome , it was in touch with the more . modern world the minute it came into existence . It was therefore a natural center for the getting , as for the distribution , of ideas . It drew them from all quarters ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out again . It has sometimes been made a reproach to the Bible that much of what was supposed to be original with the Hebrews is found to have been absorbed from the Egyptians on one side , from the Babylonians on the other , or from the more remote east or west . But the fact is an enlargement of the Bible 's function as the interpreter of mankind 's guesses at the truth . It is well to remember that the Bible 's roots struck out to  | all the known reservoirs of supply . Taking its ideas where they could be found , it purified and enriched them , but the sources were what , with due limitations , we may call universal . Abraham himself was universal . He knew all the civilizations of his time . We find him far in the east on the Persian Gulf ; far in the north , in Mesopotamia ; far in the south , in Canaan ; far in the west , at the court of the King of Egypt . More than a nomad , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinker , and a man of world experience . Standing in the twilight where the history which could only be told in myths , legends , and traditions begins to give place to the work of the chronicler , he is the first , as far as we know , to see human existence as a venture with a purpose . The purpose is dim as yet ; it is far off ; it has no clear outline ; but it is beneficent . In spite of all the ills of social corruption and international violence , of which instances are given us , the high goal at the end of man 's struggle has come into sight . It will never again go out of sight . Individuals will lose it ; whole nations will disregard it ; there will be times when a vast majority will deny that it is there ; but some will always keep it in view and lead the rest of the world on . To the man who discovered it , great honor must be due . He was not a perfect man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethics was below that which later ages reached , and even his less enlightened colleagues , the Kings of Gerar and Egypt , had the right to reproach him with dealings they found unfair . The Bible tells this with no attempt to hide a hero 's w eaknesses . Revealed to us as he is , only in the half-light between the legendary and the semihistorical , he is a credible human man who , like most pioneers , was both beyond his time and within it . But he is a great man ? the first , perhaps , of that long and stately procession of great men which the human race has produced . God Almighty For his claims to greatness rest not alone on the discovery that in his relation to God there is a purpose to man 's life . As age comes on , as experience grows richer , as thought is able to climb to higher and higher outlooks , he reaches the most overwhelming conviction that had ever , as yet , been seized by human intelligence . " Jehovah appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almighty . " It will be seen at once that in these words we are far from the merely elemental God of the more primitive ages . Whether this revelation came to Abraham , the man , or whether in Abraham , the man , it is only centered and expressed , is a point of minor importance . It came to some one . It came to some one at some time in the course of man 's expansion . The essential fact is that it came . Once having come , it began to transfigure man 's life , as the world is transfigured by the dawn . Not that the world laid hold at once of conception of Almightiness . It was a material world , and for a material world the only almightiness is in matter . To the human race at large the Almightiness of God has been theoretic only . This is as true of Church as it is of State ; as true of religion as it is of business . Abraham 's vision has always been visionary except to a few , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To active Divine Almightiness the material has always been opposed and hitherto opposed successfully . An Almighty God is not a working factor in the world of men . He is a vision , but a vision that has been seen . The stage at which the Almightiness of God supplants the almightiness of matter is one to which the human race , except in the case of individuals , has not yet attained . While reasoning is often spiritual , practise is oftener material . The condition will doubtless obtain for many generations to come . But there is this to be said for the human race , that once it  | has perceived an ideal , it never absolutely lets it go . It will play fast and loose with it , turn away from it , come back to it , turn away from it again , renounce it , abjure it ; but sooner or later it will be converted to it finally and will make it its own . In the long run it will probably assimilate this discovery of Abraham 's . An Almighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , a world which will have wearied of the experiment of governing itself through mutual suspicions , hatreds , rivalries , enmities , cut-throat diplomacies , and brutal wars , social , military , and religious . will have learned that Good-will toward men by men is the only irresistible force . To Abraham the new understanding came as a great marvel . With a God who was Almighty anything was possible . He , Abraham , was no longer hedged in by circumstance . That which he had put out of the question could happen as easily as not . Almightiness being not in matter but in God , all merely physical laws must give way to it . It was more than a conviction , more than an enthusiasm ; it became a burning and consuming faith which he could test to any extremity . Nothing was too hard for it . He could trust it to the uttermost , up to the end of reason , and beyond . During the rest of his life we see this as his dominating thought , leading to the outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac The unexpected had happened . A son by his wife had been born to his old age . The father understood that it was through the person of this lad that the new nation was to descend and the " blessing " come to the whole world . So much ryas clear . But it was also clear that by an Almighty God the hopes founded on the lad could be realized just as easily even if the person of the lad ? - ere removed . " Is anything too hard for Jehovah ? " had been the question on their lips at the time of the child 's birth . In the new discovery there was an exultation , almost a recklessness , of confidence . The suggestion rose in the father 's mind that perhaps , after all , God willed to produce the nation and work out the " blessing " through the boy , but without the boy . If so , it would simply be another triumph of His Almightiness . The knowledge that , as the Nazarene Master put it two thousand years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these stones , " was already in his mind . " And it came to pass after these things , that God did prove Abraham , and said unto him Take now thy son , thine only son whom thou lowest , even Isaac , and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of . " It must be repeated here that a primitive chronicler is telling this story in the tongue of a primitive age . For the moment it is enough to bear in mind the difference between ancient and modern ways of thought and forms of expression . What is to us the conviction of the inner man was to elemental peoples the external utterance of God . They saw direct and positive command where we see a wrestler with God putting himself to a last terrific test . And Abraham rose early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and went unto the place of which God had told him . On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off . And Abraham said unto the young men , Abide ye here with the ass , and I and the lad will go yonder ; and we will worship , and come again to you . And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son , and he took in his hand the fire and the knife ; and they went both of them together . @#  | " And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father , and said : My father ! ' " And he said : Here am I , my son . ' " And he said : Behold the fire and the wood ; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ? ' " And Abraham said : God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering , my son . ' " So they went both of them together , and they came to the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , upon the wood . And Abraham stretched forth his hand to slay his son . " The scene is one of great dramatic intensity . Nowhere else in ancient literature is there to be found a situation between a father and his boy more tender or more tragic . The lisped question , the veiled answer , get force from their very simplicity . Remembering that behind them there was not only the devotion of an old man to the son given him late in life , but the hope of the future of the world , we see how poignant must have been the nature of this sacrifice . But we see more . Beyond sacrifice is conviction . The hope of the world 's future will be realized in spite of everything . He may take the knife and slay his son , and yet God is Almighty . Almightiness will carry out the promises . In other words , faith may have been carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had not the reserves and peradventures with which we surround it today . It was not prudent ; it was not perhaps wholly sane , as we count sanity . But it was superb . It was in the grand manner . It could call on the Almighty to prove Himself Almighty by a challenge at once extravagant and sublime The Prince-Patriarch 's Situation To get the value of the episode two points must be borne in mind . r . According to the standards of his time a Prince-Patriarch had the right to slay his son . A human being had as yet no claim to the assured possession of his life . He was not an independent entity . Nothing was guaranteed to him . He had no place as a citizen , and as a subject he was little above the level of a living piece of property . If , as civilizations developed along the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile , laws were passed protecting individuals against each other , there were none to make them anything but chattels of the king . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme lord . Imagine a social condition of not a little softening of manners , but in which there was no government , no legislation , no law , no compelling force beyond that of custom and the dictates of the Chieftain . The Chieftain 's will was all there was to keep the tribe a unit . Tribal unity required not merely patriarchal rule , but patriarchal ownership . From this ownership nothing and no one was exempt . There could not , therefore , come into the Patriarch 's mind any of the qualms and questions which would have stirred in a man of a later period in history . There might be suffering in his heart , but his sense of justice would be undisturbed . Out of the fatherly love and pride in him the last drop of anguish might be wrung , but all that made him a Prince-Patriarch would be left serene . He was doing what he had an acknowledged right to do , and neither victim nor relative could have known a thought of protestation . 2 . Doubtless , too , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the higher value of the human sacrifice . I have said that , like other pioneers , he was both beyond his time and within it . If he had seized the concept of an Almighty God giving a purpose to man 's existence , there were phases of knowledge to which he had not advanced . In the inference that a human sacrifice must be dearer to God than any other sacrifice , @#  | because of its costliness to man , he was , it would seem , still of his day and generation . While in later ages a sacrifice came to bear a highly purified meaning , to elemental men it was a gift to the Deity to please and appease Him . This hope of placating God by giving Him the thing man held as most precious was not outlived for many generations . The thing man held most precious was his child , and hi child-sacrifice the ancient mind found a fearful fascination . Though the Hebrews were perhaps the first to reject in theory this conclusion as ta the Divine , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation evolved a State , the severest laws were enacted against fathers and . ' ethers who sacrificed their children , but secretly or openly the offerings continued . Of the Israelites in the time of Moses an historical recital declares that , " They sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons , and shed innocent blood ? even the blood of the ! : sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan . " Centuries later , when Judah was tottering , the reforming king , Josiah , was obliged to take measures against child-sacrifice , while in the reign of the last prince of the line of David they still , according to Jeremiah , " built the high places of Baal , which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom , to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech . " For such sacrifice to be possible there must have been a persistent and deeply-rooted belief . Something had to be gained by it , or fathers and mothers would never have so outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of God , so difficult to secure , could not but be granted to those who bought it at such a price . The Prince-Patriarch 's Reward The Prince-Patriarch belonged to his time in the degree to which he considered the sacrifice of his son an act of merit ; he was beyond his time in perceiving in the end that no such sacrifice was asked for . " And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven , and said : Abraham ! Abraham ! ' " And he said : Here am I. ' " And he said : Lay not thy hand upon the lad , neither do thou anything unto him . For now I know that thou fearest God , seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son , from me . ' " Again we must bear in mind the tendencies of primitive verbal expression . Where modern psychology would read the higher reasoning of the Patriarch 's own mind , the early chronicler heard an angel calling from the sky . Between the two , perhaps verbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an angel but a messenger ? And if God is Universal Mind , why should not our higher thoughts be messages ? If God is the Intelligent Working Energy of man , would not an Intelligent Working Energy which never speaks be mechanical and partial ? This is not argument ; it is suggestion only ; but the identification of true perception with the Voice of God 's Messenger is not without its beauty . To Abraham message followed on message , as great perceptions broadened into greater ones . He had long ago come to understand God as Almighty ; before putting himself to the supreme test he had seen Him also as Everlasting . Now the angel of the Lord calls unto him out of Heaven a second time . What he had already understood is made more positive and definite . He had gained much on his own personal account , but , after all , gain on his own personal account was but gain for the world at large . He was the first altruist we know anything about , the first to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Good for himself could only be good in proportion as they , far into the future , should share in it .  | " By myself have I sworn , saith Jehovah . because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son , that in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies . And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed , because thou has ! obeyed my voice . " The final widening of this man 's horizon was in a new understanding of spiritual cause and effect . Because he obeyed the Voice , not only he but others were to benefit . What we perceive clearly , he appreciated dimly ; that no man can do right to himself alone . That a single right act is an universal asset , in which , to its degree , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of his great discoveries in God of which we shall take note .

Sarah , whose part in the sacrifice of Isaac was probably that of dumb agony , had died in the land of Canaan . " And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah , and to weep for her . And Abraham rose up from before his dead , and spake unto the Children of Heth , saying : " I am a stranger and a sojourner with you . Give me a possession of a burying-place with you that I may bury my dead out of my sight . ' " And the Children of Heth answered Abraham , saying unto him : " Hear us , my lord .

And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the Children of Heth , even of all that went in and out of the gate of his city , saying : " Nay , my lord ; hear me . The field I give thee ; and the cave that is therein , I give it thee . In the presence of the children of my people give I it thee . Bury thy dead .
