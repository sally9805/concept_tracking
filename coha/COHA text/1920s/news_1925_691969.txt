txt The inquiry into aviation which President COOLIDGE 'S Air Board is conducting by taking the evidence of War and Navy Department heads , officers of the sea and land and air services , other authorities and specialists , is especially valuable because it attracts general attention throughout the country . Everybody wants to read about it . The information is brought out in popular style , by question and answer . It is to be a running debate on mooted Points , such as whether there should be a unified Air Service . whether the development of aviation has been retarded by conservatism in the army and navy , whether appropriations have been adequate and properly expended on modern planes , whether in the matter of promotion and pay there is discrimination against the officers of the Army Air Service , and , the greatest question of all , the importance of aviation as a factor in fighting on land and sea . There is nothing like an investigation with open doors , especially after sensational charges that something is wrong have been made , to assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way as to hold the ihterest of the people . On Feb. 19 the report of a special board of naval officers of high rank upon the relation of aviation to the navy was published without making any stir . That inquiry , ordered by Secretary Wn , eun , was painstaking and thorough . It went over much the same ground that Mr. COOLIDGE 'S Air Board will have to traverse . It remains a monument of research . But when summaries of the report were published , little attention was paid to them . Had the facts , and opinions then assembled been appreciated at their true value , Colonel MITCHELL ' s propaganda of the past Summer would not have made such a sensation . It seems , however , that it was necessary to arouse the American people to a realization of the vital Importance of . aviation to national defense . Hence the Air Board and the day 's story that everybody is reading . There is a division in the army about a unified Air Service , as the testimony already shows . The navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of War , DWIGHT F. DAVIS ; the Chief of Staff , Major Gen. JOHN HINES , and his assistant , Brig . Gen. HUGH A. DRUM , oppose the proposal of Colonel MITCHELL . Even the chief of the Army Air Servie &; General PATRICK , does not approve of the plan of an Air Service Department with representation in the Cabinet . His idea of a Ministry of Defense , combining army , navy and air , is not deeply impressive , because he admits that the time is not ripe for such an organization . When General HINES was asked whether there should be , a single Air Service under a Cabinet head , he emphatically said " No ! " . eaplaining , he maintained that " an air service is " an essential element of . an army or " navy , " It was tied to the ground , or to a ship . The demands of , tteither the army nor the navy would be met if the Air Service were an independent organization . General HINES declared that an Air Department " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with consequent increase of " cost . " Our war experience tells us that the cost of aviation and upkeep can be very high . General HINES made a telling point when he declared that there should be but one consideration in determining air organization , and that was " efficiency in combat . " He denied that an indep , endent air force would be as serviceable as one under the immediate control of an army commander . General DRUM drove this point home when he said that " the greatest deficiency of our " air force in France was that it had " not been trained with other combat " branches of the army . " In stating his objections to a unified Air Service , Secretary WILBUR depended upon the elaborate arguments of his own board , which reported in February . It would remove " from the naval commander , " he said . " that unity of command in time of " battle , and that uniformity of train " ing in time of peace , which every " war has proved to be essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Secretary was speaking with authority when he said that " press comment from Great Britain , " where the pendulum is already " swinging back toward naval control " for seagoing aviation , recognizes the " soundness of our air policy . " One wonders how long after war broke out the British Government would allow the Air Ministry to dominate the defense of the country .
