The 67th Congress has adjourned . It was in session 622 days out of two years , considered about 14,600 bills , and passed about 600 . It snubbed the Administration and suffered much ridicule and excoriation at the hands of the public . Of the 531 members , 138 were repudiated by their constituencies . <P> Torn by schisms , the strong Republican Congress that convened two years ago presented a state of disorganization at the end of its career . The Senate was peevish and forgot the traditional courtesy of thanking the Vice President and the President pro tem . The House was boisterous , with the assistance of the Marine Band and much backslapping . Nobody turned the legislative clock back to prolong the last day . <P> The 67th Congress made peace with Germany , revised taxes , cut government expenses , provided loans for farmers , reduced naval armament , passed a high tariff and a reduced immigration bill , ratified the British debt settlement . <P> It failed to pass a ship subsidy , a bonus , a revised Transportation Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganization of executive departments , the Ford Muscle Shoals offer , an anti-lynching bill , and 77 constitutional amendments . <P> Ninety-nine minor bills were run through at the last moment , all of which the good-natured Mr. Harding signed in an hour at the Capitol .
