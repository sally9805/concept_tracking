txt Report and findings of Special Master Graham in the Consolidated Gas Co. case are the most important yet made in the litigation against the $1 gas law- Should they be upheld through to the United States Supreme Court , not only will the $1 gas rate be thrown out , but the companies can prove that the old rate of $1-15 a thousand feet is inadequate . Successful conclusion of the fight to ' the highest court , on the basis of the master 's report , will mean that New York City gas companigs will be entitled to a rate of at least $1.25 . Such a rate would be based on the master 's findings of an actual investment in gas properties by Consolidated Gas , not including gas subsidiaries , of $99,000,000 ; that the company is entitled to an SC-c return , and that to get such a return would require a rate of $1.25 .
