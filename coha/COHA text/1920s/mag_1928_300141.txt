POINT COUNTER POINT-Aldous Huxley-Doubleday Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> Intricate and difficult is counterpoint- " the art of adding melodies , according to fixed rules , as accompaniment to a given melody . " If Author Huxley 's " given melody " is perhaps the conflict between passion and reason , it is outnoised by his myriad irrelevant themes . If he has any " fixed rules , " they are well camouflaged in a medley of deliriously discordant , rarely harmonious , characters-famous Artist Bidlake whose voluptuous youth has reluctantly passed into caustic Rabelaisian senility ; his writer-son who flings aside a reproachful mistress for the wanton daughter of a musty scientist ; a suave sadist who bullies , tortures , kills , for the sheer thrill of it ; an editor-publisher , bitterly caricatured , who fleeces his authors , but shows his mistress an almost inhuman tenderness ; a conversational philosopher who is said to be the author 's particular mouthpiece . As such , he is a brilliantly garrulous person , for Huxley fairly seethes with things to be said about art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a few devotees ; but to many they are meaningless , affected , smartly vulgar . Point Counter Point is a rich symphony of modern semi-intellectual London , done into polished prose that will be read slowly and with great relish-by the devotees .
