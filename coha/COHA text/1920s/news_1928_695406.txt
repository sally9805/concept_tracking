Recent absorption by Republic of Sheet &; Tubes , Inc. , following its acquisition earlier this year of Trumbull Steel , has resulted in reports that the interests who bought into Republic last year are planning to enlarge the company greatly , first by the purchase of Central Alloy Steel and later of other companies . While there are possibilities of further expansion by Republic along these lines not.ling immediate is likely . Republic now is engaged in consolidating and harmonizing its present facilities . New Pipe Proves .. Acquired Purchase of Steel &; Tubes not only give Republic an additional outlet for its semi-finished steel , but puts it in control of patents for electrical welding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weld thin pipe . And the resultant Joint is stronger than the pipe itself . This puts welded pipe in a position to compete with seamless steel pipe for various uses for which welded pipe hitherto has been unsuitable .

Republic common enjoyed a sharp rise Thursday , advancing to a new high for the year at 701y against a 1928 low of 493,8 , Accompanying the rise were rumors of great possibilities of profit from the welding patents . While these patents are undoubtedly valuable , just how important a source of earnings they will prove to be remains to be seen .
