Nuns ask for them for recreation . First a nun . Have you meant to have fun and funny things . Do you like to see funny things for fun . Objects lie on a table . We live beside them and look at them and then they are on the table then . Objects on a table and the explanation . Who says glasses . Who says salt in Savoy . Who does say pots of porcelain . And who does say that earthen ware is richer than copper , glass , enamel , or cooking . We have the very best celery salad and selection . Now then read for me to me what you can and will see . I see what there is to see . You want to show more effort than that . And now how do you do . I have done very well . The objects on the table have been equal to the occasion . We can decorate walls with pots and pans and flowers . I question the flowers . And bananas . Card board colored as bananas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one should not happen to be there what would happen , the green would unhappily unhappily result in hardness and we could only regret that the result was unfortunate and so we astonish no one nor did we regret riches . Riches are not begun . They have a welcome in oceans . Oceans can not spread to the shore . They began description and so we relish seas . Over seas objects are on the table that is a wooden table and has not a marble top necessarily . So thank every one and let us begin faintly . As to houses certainly houses have not the same restfulness as objects on the table which mean to us an arrangement . You do not arrange houses nor do you fancy them very much . I have a fancy for a house . When I appeal I appeal to their relation . What is a relation . A British Dominion . And will there ever be no memory will there even not be a memory . I remember you . And you . Yes you remember you remember me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and you you feel as I do . I remember you , and you are certainly aroused by the apple the descent from the cross and the dog and the squirrel . You do please when you please . Combining everything with everything . This is their flour . I find that milk salt flour and apples and the pleasant respective places of each one in the picture make a picture . Esther . I prefer a merry go round . And I a street . And I nothing at all says Rose as she decides to stay away . But she comes again repeatedly . Have you hesitated about singing . Have you hesitated about singing . He said he had met her there . And now we have explained the interest a cellist can show in a sculptor . She does not play the cello any more but she does continue to cover the wood the stone and the wood and color the wood . She does not color the wood . And now houses and buildings and houses and the buildings containing houses . I live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not bother to remember about the other place of worship . See to it that you have an equal respect for all who are all together . And then when you mean to see me . Call to me . Come to me readily and prepare in that way . What do you know about fields and table-cloths . Objects are on the table when I am there . And when you are not there . Let me explain this to you . About ten pages . And what are their ages . Their ages are you know , you know what their ages are and their weights and their measures . And you know how very soon we can be up before noon . Yes . To-morrow and then we will buy we will buy we will not buy , yes we will not buy all that we need to buy because we will not be able to agree about them . You agree with me . And so we will see just what we need to gladden their Christmas tree . Objects on the table do not imitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Esther be named Esther and not take cognisance of Ahasuerus but only of Olga she is a Russian how dare she . Does he shine when he means to whine . Of course he does and now speak connectedly . He said that he respected the expression of opinion and she said , I believe in looking facts in the face . And he said and what do you see when you do as you say you do and she said I see but you and he said the same to you . And then they said they greatly appreciate the painting of houses and objects on a table . Come up out of there is very well said when the instinct which has lead to the introduction of words and music not pictures and music , not pictures and words not pictures and music and words , not pictures not music not words when the instinct which has lead to the spread of rubbing has been shed then we will invite each one to sign himself Yours sincerely Herman G. Read and very quickly I include everything in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will . Ladies change . How can you neglect admissions . And she was seated and she said I am not pledged to much retribution . Come again . Forward and back . Look right and not left . And lend a hand . The lend a hand society . Calming . Pocket the watch . Can soldiers surround a chinaman . Pray then . Pray then why do you wish for this thing . Providing . Providing you need strengthening why do you reiterate that you are coming . Going and coming . Was he willing . Has he been willing . When is he willing to vary everything . He says he invents nothing and then I say do not invent a table cloth to-day do not let the table table that you invented stay . And he says I am very willing but I have had to invent something to fill in and I say to him you had better really have it and he said I am not able to get it and I say to him I am sorry I have not one to lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will realize that I can replace it and I say I am willing to address you and he replied , I do not doubt that you will be of great assistance to me and as for the result that is still in question . What is the difference between houses and a table . What is the difference between objects on a table and furniture in houses . Had you ever thought of that . Objects on a table make a standpoint of recompense and result , furniture in houses do decide matters . Very well let us come to that decision . No they come together . Scotchmen , frenchman chinaman negro and the black races . When will you adopt . You or me , when this you see remember me . Chinamen are cautious with negroes with frenchmen with scotchmen and with candles . They are cautious with oil and impoverishment . No one is easily impoverished then . And now compare them with these . They have instincts they cook and turn and apples and salt . These have their way , they are not wretched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so many people appeal . They appeal to flushing . They flush when they have no rapid silence there . And they do not despise arrangements . Who can be merciless to the best armament . And do they like poise . I like the noise . I do not like the noise . How can you forget riches . Riches can mean prejudice . Can riches mean that . Yes in a crew . How can you cut a fish . Babies look , boys look and we look . We look there . Believe the future that he tells her . Really though she told him . He was not disappointed because I had warned him . Objects have been recognised as a knife , a pot , a pan , a cover , a ladle , carrots , apples and a salt cellar . These all have been recognised which really is not so astonishing as his aunt is a farmer and cultivates her own ground and has cows and sheep and a sheep dog . His mother is an exceedingly capable manager and his father has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and has been retired on a pension . His sister and brother-in-law have a hard ware store and do a successful business although in their part of the country it is exceedingly difficult to get payment . You can see that it is not astonishing that the objects are easily recognised . They are a chair , table , tea cup , tea pot , a pot , a ladle , a bottle a pan , a cover carrots , salt-cellar with salt in it , apples and a pitcher . It would appear that she is near , it would appear that he is near he is nearly he is merely delayed . And so he will come . And so he will come . And so he will come . And so he will come . He will be welcome . He will come when he has time . And what will he do then . He will say that objects are to-day recognised as something with which to play . And we will reply this is not why we like them here but the real reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of this reasoning . We have displaced them because we have replaced them . Thank you so very much for this explanation . Please tell Mr. Edmund Holt that if he will understand I will be delighted . And houses with their hooks upon which in the country they still do need to hoist furniture and water and other hooks that support the lights . It is very interesting that a light or a house is sometimes on the side and sometimes at a corner and in either case it compares very nicely with the house even in the day time when the light is not lit and the house is not necessarily ready to be recognised . A house readily recognised is no longer necessary and yet can we deny recognition can we deny that yesterday we were certainly not displeased with our residence . How lovelily the wall how lovelily all of the wall and we do not necessarily hesitate he did not , he found it thin . The wall is thick and not heavy and has a support and when you look at it again they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted red and a lemon yellow and pretty soon every ten years they will again oblige every one to do something , to paint the houses and arrange a wall which is crumbling . This is the law that they are reinforcing . And where did his mother get her ration . She did not she had copper and earthen ware pots and so she found then when he went away she had nothing to say . How neatly a man and a woman who go away every day come home to stay . They are very neat in their washing and ironing and in their eating and drinking and in their sleeping and waking . Can you believe that he uses their room all day . Can you believe this I say to you and he has said to me that he was under no obligation to them for anything . He was not satiated with eating how could he be in choosing bananas or a persimmon . How can he be violently radiating when ordinarily he was visiting and when visiting they had said to him , listen while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . Objects on a table are hazardous . Imitate a cheese if you please . We are very well pleased with gold coin and ribbons . Imitate a cheese very well if you please , and readily reflect how can you be credulous of more than the assumption of imitating ham . We were not pleased with the imitation of the lamb . I have a special taste in feeling . I can feel very well . I can feel that some resemblances the resemblance between a sausage made of sugar and a sausage made of meat is not as great as the resemblance between an object made of almonds and an object made of wood . How often do we see what we have not readily recognised . I readily recognise the object that has the most perfect quality of imitation . Then can you be astonished by a meal . How easily you had rather blame him and blame them and how easily she had rather fly than swim . We have discouraged her together we have discouraged her altogether . Dogs are good for photography and recoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you be so anxious . She was told to be measured and she said assuredly I shall be there . How often do you mean to remain . Remain to me the culminating tender tree . And how can a woodbine twine . And now how do you feel what you hear . I come back to expecting a house and a farm and not a farmhouse and a southern climate in the north . We do not go very far north . Mountains are just the same , very nearly the same . I have had a special taste in rivers . And now remember to see me . Objects on a table are all there and I do not care to say that they have been studied . Study again and again and leave me to my wishes I wish that they could copy all of it as well as they do copy it . No one can say yes again . Have I forgotten that fruits do not remember flowers , that flowers contain what they contain and that together with fruit they do not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to share fruits and at the same time know that I have wished to be queen . How can she stay there very easily . She gets up and she says very well this is quite what I mean . So we consider flowers masculine . We have not mentioned the resemblance between trees and streets and all of the things that have not been constructed . How can you prejudice him . We are not only patient but satisfied , we are not only satisfied but more than satisfied . Do we suppose that a rose is a rose . Do we suppose that all she knows is that a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose . He knows and she knows that a rose is a rose and when she can make a song as to which can belong as to what can belong to a song . Now let us pray that a table may that a table may very well stay , that a table may that a table very well may stay to be settled for in that way . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table upon which they will not permanently be put away . We had a wish and the wish was that when rose colored ribbons and no roses because of course after all roses are supposed to be of the color of imitation trees . How can you imitate trees so prettily . I find I have changed my meaning , I find I have changed my meaning in changing my meaning from the meaning I had to this meaning . I mean to do right . I do not mean to settle the clamor by reiterating have you met one another and do you care to ask a question . I ask the question I say have you succeeded , you succeed . Can you succeed and do you succeed . I succeed in recalling this to their mind . I do not fall behind .                                             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
