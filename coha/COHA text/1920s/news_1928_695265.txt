txt An assertion that the Methodist Episcopal Church South has and must take a determined stand politically in active support of prohibition is made in a joint statement issued here tonight by four Southern Methodist Bishops . 1 The statement , without mentioning by name Governor Smith of New York as Democratic candidate , calls upon the clergy and laymen of the Church to oppose " the election to the Presidency of a man whose personal and official record both brand him as the outstanding enemy of national prohibition . " I : is in reply to recent statements , by Bishops Warren A. Candler of Atlanta , Ga. , and Collins Denny of Richmond , in which they argued , and quoted the Southern Methodist records , against " bringing the Church into politics . " These two Bishops made their pronouncement opposing entry of the Church into - the present campaign following the conference at Asheville , N.

Moore of Dallas , Texas ; James Cannon Jr . of Richmond , and Horace M. Du Bose of Nashville , Tenn . It quotes from . episcopal addresses and the records of General Conferences to show that , both before and after the adoption of national prohibition , the Methodist Episcopal Church South has been especially concerned in placing in office men who are " sincere friends " of prohibition . Statement of the Bishops . The statement of Bishops Mouzon , I Moore , Cannon and Du Bose was as follows : " On July 16 Bishop Warren A. Candlergave to the secular press a statement containing quotations from the deliverances of Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church South between the 17th day of August , 1865 , and the 21st of May , 1894 . Concerning these deliverances Bishop Candler says ? ' I see no reason to dissent from the position of my Church on the subject of personal and party politics as that position has been proclaimed authoritatively by its leaders from the beginning of its history as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement with the words of our Lord when He witnessed his good confession before Pontius Pilate , ' My kingdom is not of this world .

' " It is not our desire or purpose to discuss or to criticize any of the statements made by the lishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church South between ' 865 and 1894 on the position of the Chi rch on the subject 1 of personal and part : ' politics . Those Bishops openly and courageously met in their own way the condition which confronted them in those days ; but it is likewise true that Bishops , ministers and laymen of our Church in our days and generation have met with equal frankness and courage the great moral issues which have confronted them . " Therefore , in view of the statements made by Bishcps Candler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the opponents of rtrohibition , it becomes absolutely necessary that the attitude of the Methodist Episcopal Church South on the question of prohibition should be plainly set forth by quotation from episcopal addresses and from the official record of the General Conference of the Church , which utterances of the highest and most representative body of the Church must be accepted as the final authority . A Prohibition Church . " First  --  Extract Report Committee on Temperance adopted by General Conference in Asheville , May 12. 1910 . Whereas the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , has ever gone before the world as the unalterable foe of the liquor traffic , and is a prohibition church , which will never consider a compromise with this heinous sin ; and whereas greater strides have been made in temperance in the home of Southern Methodism in the South  --  than in any other part of our Union in recent years , to the furtherance of which our church has been one of the principal factors , Resolved .

It was He who said in His Church : " Ye are the salt of the earth . ye are the light of the world . " " It is exceedingly interesting to compare the quotations milde by Bishop Candler on July 16 , 1928 , ' My kingdom is not of this world , ' with the quotation made by Bishop Candler in the Episcopal address in 1914 , ' Ye are the salt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In neither case is there any distinction made between the ministry and the laity . Rejoice at Victories . " Fourth ? Extract from Report Committee on Temperance adopted Atlanta , 1918 : " Resolved , that we rejoice in the unparalleled nation-wide victories which have been won in the warfare against the liquor traffic and the social evil , victories so great that there is hope that the irrepressible warfare to make our whole country safe from the greed and covetousness of the saloon and the red-light district will be won in the near future .

" Seventh  --  Extract from Episcopal address , May , 1926 , Memphis , read by Bishop Denny . signed by all the bishops , including Bishop Candler . The National - Prohibition law is the most remarkable social enactment by any great nation to promote the general welfare by the restriction of the activity of the individual . The full effect of such a law will not be secured immediately , or even in a decade ; that the results already secured are exceedingly beneficial is evident to an impartial observer , and there is good reason to expect far greater benefits in the future . The industrial , social , educational , moral and religious forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrew the legalized liquor traffic , and secured national prohibition . The same great forces must unitedly fight with equal vigor and persistence the outlawed criminal traffic and the would-be nullifiers of the law . * * * Adequate appropriation should be made by State and nation to provide ? a sufficient number of men with salaries commensurate with such important dangerous work . Prosecution of offenders should be speedy , penalties by Judges and juries should be adequate , violators of the Prohibition law , however prominent , should be branded as criminals . Above all there must be continued everincreasing emphasis upon the educational process in the press , in the pulpit and in the school , setting forth the evil of alcoholism and the destructive results of lawlessness upon the entire fabric of the national life . Oppose Any Nullification . " Eighth  --  Resolutions adopted by General Conference by unanimous rising vote May 11 , 1926 , Memphis . Resolved , That the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , assembled in Memphis , Tenn. , in quandrennial session , representing a Christian citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress of the United States to reject all proposals to enact any legislation which has for its object the nullification or the weakening of the prohibition enforcement act , commonly known as the Volstead Law . We most positively insist that when men openly flaunt their determination to violate any law of our country , the Government must suppress anarchy and compel obedience to the laws absolutely regardless of cost . " Ninth  --  Extract , report , Committee of Temperance , unanimously adopted by General Conference , Memphis , May 20 , 1926 . The pronouncement of the Bishops on the National Prohibition Law should be read from every pulpit in the Church . It is a clarion call which should ring throughout our border and stir all supporters of temperance and prohibition to action . * * * The campaign for nullification must be answered by a crusade for observance and enforcement . The laws must be administered by its friends . In our states from constable to Governor and in the nation , from revenue agent to President , officials must be selected who believe in enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it ought to be the law . Full power and authority of the States must be exercised in co-operation with the general Government . To the attainment of these ends , we call upon our preachers and teachers to give voice to the social creed of our Church . and upon all our people to assert their full influence as Christians and as patriotic citizens of our Republic . " These quotations from recent episcopal addresses and recent acts ( 1910-1926 ) of the General Conference , which is the highest authority of our Church and which is composed of an equal number of preachers and laymen , indicate the definite . Positive attitude of the Methodist Episcopal Church South on the subje 1 of prohibition . The abolition of the beverage liquor traffic is regarded as a great moral issue , and the entire membership of the Church , both ministry and laity , are called upon to fight unitedly , with vigor and persistence the outlawed criminal traffic and the would-be nullifiers of the law . " We emphasize that in the episcopal address of 1922 it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen ( ministers and laymen ) to work for the placing in power of men , who are sincere friends of the law . ' Also in the last recorded action of the General Conference ( 1926 ) it is declared . ' That in our State , from constable to Governor . and in the natiln , from revenue agent to President , officials must be selected who believe in enforcement not only because prohibition is the law . but because it ought to be the law , and all our people . ( ministers as well as laymen ) are called upon to exert ' their full influence as Christians and as patriotic citizens of our republic . ' " It - would be an unthinkable repudiation of our personal responsibility as Christian citizens and a base betrayal of those who have a right to look to us for moral leadershin to retire from the field at ' this critical . juncture in the warfare with this age-long enemy of mankind . We notify the defenders and the advocates of the liquor traffic that the moral forces of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are ' bringing the Church into politics ' because they are opposing the election to the Presidency of a man whose personal and official record both brand him as the outstanding enemy of national prohibition , for which great reform we have ourselves not only as citizens but also as Christian ministers been working for many years . " The extracts quoted above show that in our present attitude and activity we are in full accord with the highest authority of our Church . " EDWIN MOUZON , " JOHN M. MOORE , " HORACE M. DU BOSE , " JAMES CANNON Jr . " DEFENDS SMITH IN GEORGIA . State Chairman Says Nominee Has Right to Seek Modification . ROME , Ga. , July 26 ( JP ) . ? The prohibition plank of the Democratic Party is merely a pledge to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead act , and makes no reference to repeal , maintenance or modification , Chairman G. Ed Maddock of the Georgia Democratic Executive Committee today wrote Bishop W. N. Ainsworth of the Methodist Episcopal Church South . The letter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Party leaders of Georgia , in which the Bishop called attention to the plank and asked by what right the party nominee had said he expected to seek changes in the present enforcement law . Mr. Maddox , who served as a member of the Platform Committee at Houston . said the prohibition plank was accepted by a majority of the committee on the idea that prohibition was not and ought not be a party question and that Democrats and Republicans alike , irrespective of party affiliations , were entitled to their own individual views on such a great moral question . " Bishop Ainsworth had recalled that a wet plank was rejected by the committee . Mr. Maddox agreed with this , but pointed out that there had also been an amendment offered by Governor Dan Moody of Texas not only to enforce the prohibition amendment and enforcement law , but to pledge the party to their maintenance . He said this was rejected by the committee along with other views ranging all thn way from the Moody resolution to outright repeal of the amendment . Disagrees With Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , be he nominee or mere party follower , has the right to express and urge his own personal views On the question of prohibition , " Mr Maddox 's letter continued . " In answer to your question as to whether I endorse the action of the nominee in declaring his views on the prohibition question and that he will urge the adoption thereof , I unhesitatingly say that I disagree with him and regret that he holds such views ; but , as he has emphatically declared that he would honestly enforce the prohibition laws as long as they are a part of our statute law , I am clearly of the opinion that there is nothing ' in the platform which excludes him from urging a modification of those laws if he sees fit " Expressing the belief that the election of Governor Smith would not endanger the prohibition amendmen ? or its enforcement , due to a ' majority of Senators and Representatives in Congress who oppose repeal or modification , the State Chairman added : " If Governor Smith or any one else can suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with the prevailing conditions surrounding the enforcement of these laws , I believe that every true advocate of temperance will welcome it . " I can only say that choice : of . party or . loyalty to the party is a question for the conscience of each individual . "
