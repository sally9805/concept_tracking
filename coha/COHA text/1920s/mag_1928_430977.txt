THE American woman 's idea of religion is summed up in the word " service . " It begins ? it almost ends ? there . In this is its strength and its weakness . " Service " is of course almost a cant word in America . Every business man , since Mr. Ford showed him the way , is engaged in " giving service " to the community ; every gasoline pump is a " service station . " It is the most overworked word in the American language , for it is employed upon all occasions . Overworked or not , it expresses something exceedingly fine . It expresses the fact that Americans are the kindest people on earth . Their kindness is not merely in giving , though they " give like gods " ; it is in serving too , and no one who knows America ? if only as a visitor ? can ever forget the amazing consideration and thought-out kindness that meets and surrounds him here . To women everywhere the idea of service makes an instant appeal . To American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom of heaven come on earth . It is a great and glorious ambition , and certainly it is in keeping with the teaching of our Lord , who said : " When ye pray , say Our Father , . . . thy kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven . ' " I speak of Protestant America , for I judge that America is primarily a Protestant Christian country . Perhaps I should find myself correcting my opinion if I had had the opportunity of coming into closer contact with Roman Catholic America , but ? to my regret ? I have met few Roman Catholics here and , naturally , have not been in touch with their church life and ideals . Protestantism seems to me to intensify the natural inclination of Anglo-Saxondom , and of women , to emphasize the practical side of their religion . The Protestant has always been more interested in building the City of God than in the making of saints . I write in California ( a state which I visit now for the first time ) and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her history , and reading the life of her great pioneer missionary ? Fray Junipero Serra . I confess that there is , for me , a charm in the story of these heroic Franciscan friars , and a beauty in their buildings that I can not find in the equally heroic history of the sturdy Pilgrim Fathers . The deserted ( or now restored ) missions , mellowed by time but always full of charm , attract me , while the more active and practical Protestant buildings leave me cold . There was something aggressive and even arrogant in the spirit of the Pilgrim Fathers . Asking for help from their government at home , they would write that it should be given because " we are not as others are , easily discouraged by little things . " Junipero Serra , on the same errand to the Spanish Government in Mexico , takes leave of his brethren when he has attained his object , " praying them to forgive him any ill example he may have given them . " Certainly Junipero was not a whit more " easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history most clearly shows ; but he never dreamed of comparing himself with others , to their disadvantage . He compared himself to his Master , Christ , and found himself a miserable sinner . His humble spirit leaves a fragrance , while the Pilgrim Father extorts admiration without affection . Yet how much better state builders were those same sturdy Protestants ! The utter devotion , the heroic courage of the Franciscan friars were spent in making converts among the Indians , and " the acceptance of - baptism , the regular attendance at church , veneration of the sacred images and emblems of the Catholic faith , were sufficient in their minds to secure to an Indian full membership in the church . " * After this , they were looked after , protected , guided , even instructed , but as children are . The Pilgrim Fathers built after another fashion . Their descendants are still busy building to-day . And no sooner had women attained the position in the social order which they now hold in America than they too turned with buoyant optimism and determination to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RESPONSIBLE FOR PROHIBITION The result is perhaps Protestantism versus Roman Catholicism , or perhaps Anglo-Saxondom versus the rest of the world , or the West versus the East , or a little of all these ; certainly the result is a lively and a militant religion of an intensely practical sort . The  | women of America are largely responsible for Prohibition and for a multitude of practical attempts to make the kingdom of heaven come quickly . They did not propose to work the miracle by making people interested in something better than the exciting business of getting more or less drunk ; they did not first attack the evil surroundings which , with us , so often lead to drinking ; they simply , and at one stroke , sought to remove the drink . That the result has been in many ways good I can not doubt ; that it has also been in some ways bad I do not doubt either . Whether the good or the bad will in the end prevail , America must judge for herself , while the Englishwoman , conscious of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watches with an interest painful in its intensity . What concerns me here is the method of the attack on this great evil ? direct , uncompromising , - external ? and the fact that its driving force came , and comes still , from Protestant American women , and has been their most remarkable use of power . American women have , of course , a unique position . Some of them indeed assure me that American men " do not take them seriously . " And in a sense , perhaps , this is true ; but only in the very general sense that nowhere in the world do the sexes take each other perfectly seriously . Men everywhere feel that the real business of life is their affair in the end . Women are equally convinced that , compared with themselves , men are a set of Peter Pans who forever refuse to grow up . Taking this for granted , it remains true that American women have more freedom , greater equality in educational advantages , and , in consequence , more economic independence than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the world , American men really do refuse to take them seriously , American men are guilty of extreme folly . The single instance of Prohibition should be enough to convince them of this . Whether they think it good or bad , there can be no doubt of its importance ; and everywhere I find its passage into law stated to be , in great part , the work of women . It is inevitable that American women , entering into political life , should do something ! Why else are they educated and equipped either for a career and economic independence of their own , or for a husband whose first business it is to maintain them in a good position ? In neither case do they expect to lead a life of leisure . The standard of life in America , which is the pride of  | Americans and the admiration of the world , is maintained at an almost terrifying cost to all but the wealthiest women . Indeed , women have insisted on a marvelous equipment of labor-saving devices . The multiplicity of bathrooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the absence of dustcollecting " ornaments " ? all reflect the determination of American women to have beautiful homes without becoming slaves to them . The amount of intelligence which they have put into the maintenance of the American standard of living alone makes it possible ; money by itself could not do it . It still takes an alarming toll of the strength of women ; but it does make it possible for them to take up public work without neglecting home duties , and the possibility is seized upon with an energy and good will that is astounding . I , at least , am too much a woman not to realize ? as men visiting the United States for a few weeks or months rarely do ? what a real religious impulse it is that gives such public service . With all the labor-saving apparatus at their command , the standard these women set for themselves is too high not to mean incessant work , forethought , and organizing capacity . An American home is a work of art and a triumph of administration . What cookery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , however , they are not content . They seek to make the world a home , no less spotless , hospitable , and orderly than their own . In one city , a reporter , after ten minutes conversation with me , reproachfully observed : " When our women come into public life , they always seem to get off on the subject of peace ! " I was rebuked . I had talked to a reporter for ten whole minutes in a town in the very heart of the Middle West and had not yet broached any international affair . He was right . When the American woman comes into public life , she wants to know why the world ca n't live in peace . She wants to see that it does , in future . She wants to make her religion work ? and after all , it is the religion of the Prince of Peace ! Once more , I warn the American male : if he does not take his women seriously , he is making a miscalculation . They take themselves seriously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure of war . Christianity , they think , ought to work ? or what is it for ? I am a pragmatist myself . Perhaps all Anglo-Saxons are . Perhaps all women are . When people are both women and ? in great part ? Anglo-Saxon , and moreover have education and  |  public responsibility , a high degree of energy and political power ? look out ! Such people want a religion that will work . They believe they have one . They intend to try it out . Not for nothing do so many American women have the blood of the Pilgrim Fathers in their veins . The number who trace their descent to the passengers on the " Mayflower " may be , in fact , a joke : in spirit it is anything but a joke , as the world will find . In all this , however , joyful and congenial though I find it ? for I , also , am an Anglo-Saxon , a little tempered by the Celt ? there is , I very respectfully suggest , an element of weakness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In theological language we should say it can be " redeemed . " This is a fundamental principle of Christianity . In the work of reformation , however , we are apt to become so exceedingly busy that we easily fall into the habit of trying short cuts . At first sight it seems a kind of selfishness to be concerned in the making of saints or the salvation of one 's own soul . Certainly it often becomes so . But though concentration on spiritual discipline may be the besetting sin of the spiritual East , a complete neglect of it is the curse of the practical West . Filled with her desire to serve , the American woman sets about the building of the City of God , and often fails , because , born organizer and administrator that she is , she does not perceive that organization is not enough . Even good conduct is not enough . Nor can good conduct be permanently achieved by any amount of organizing , admonition , or even legislation , unless the spirit of good will exists behind it . CIGARETTES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , perhaps , not an American in the world who would not applaud the platitude ? it is not really admitted . For this is , of course , the real weakness of American religious women : they believe much too strongly in external reformation . They have been too active in the service of the world to give much thought to themselves ; consequently they really do not know themselves or human nature . I have been much impressed by this fact in the reaction of the American religious public to the discovery that a supposedly religious woman ? myself ? occasionally smokes cigarettes . It was not because the more extreme anti-cigarette women canceled my engagements or abused me for smoking . People have a  | right to believe that nicotine , even in the smallest amounts , is a terrible poison and must have all the shocking results , both on my health in this world and my destiny in the next , that have been freely prophesied in letters and " literature " sent to me by mail . ( Others , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that struck me in this connection was the kind of appeal that was , in most cases , addressed to me . That cigarettes smoked at the rate of about half a dozen in a week could not possibly injure my health , either in this world or the next , was generally very freely admitted . That it had no religious significance whatever was conceded also . " But , " I was assured , " American women can not smoke in moderation . If they smoke at all , they must become cigarette fiends . Though you , and perhaps other English women , can smoke a little and be content with that , will you not give it up for the sake of your American sisters who can not ? " Let me say at once that , knowing many Americans and perceiving them to be as capable of self-control as other people ? and a good deal more than some ? I do not believe this accusation . But , apart from this , and supposing that it were true , how in the world does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not affect it at all . If I should cease to smoke , American women would be exactly as self-controlled ? or un-self-controlled  --  as they were before . It is not , admittedly , a few cigarettes that matter ; it is the inability to stop there . How am I going to help them to " stop there " ? So far as I can " help " them at all ( which seems to me rather a ridiculous proposition ) , it should surely be by " stopping there " myself . The attitude of mind which thinks cigarette-smoking really wicked is not universal ; in this extreme form it is , I believe , not even common . Only one women 's organization canceled its engagements with me , while two others passed resolutions and hurled excommunications against me . This was all . And in the course of about seventy public meetings held right across the continent and almost always followed by an open forum , I was only once asked about my smoking and even then by a questioner who sent up his question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the idea that something is gained by consciously and deliberately setting what is called " a good example " is common ? seems , indeed , almost universal . This is so , even when it is  | openly admitted that the example set will not be followed . One religious journal , for example , publicly addressed to me a most kindly and courteous appeal to " set a good example " to the world by voluntarily abandoning a habit which could be no great sacrifice , and added that in the religious communion it represented , the ministers were required to sign a pledge not to smoke before they were accepted for ordination . Yet , in the very same article , the editor admitted that the fight against the use of tobacco by men ( other than ministers ) had been given up in despair . To whom , then , and for what conceivable purpose , were the ministers setting a good example ? To the young ladies of their congregations ? Is it seriously supposed that they will abstain from smoking because the ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely ? It seems inconceivable . But then I frankly admit that the whole argument is incomprehensible to me . I replied to the appeal , because it was so courteously worded and so free from abusive epithets . I explained that I did not believe that religion was a matter of such trifles as the smoking of six cigarettes in a week , and added that I did not smoke at all in Lent . I did not dream that it was necessary to explain that I did this in order to test my own power of self-control it seemed sufficiently obvious . The editor , however , returned to the attack in his next issue by asking if I supposed the sacrifice of thirty-six cigarettes would " impress or interest God . " On this I abandoned the controversy . The idea that , by giving up smoking , I should impress young ( female ) America with the excellence of my example seemed to me ridiculous and pretentious enough . ' When it came to a hope of impressing the Deity , I gave up . GOOD EXAMPLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because it is good but because of the effect it will have on someone else , is part of the weakness of a too external religion . The haunting hope of achieving something by " setting a good example " must be exorcised . If we only took time to think , to deepen our own spiritual life , to measure our weaknesses and seek a conquest over them , we should certainly find that we are not helped but hindered by the conscious setters of good examples . A good man is inspiring ? his goodness , infectious ? because he loves goodness . He makes us love it too , because we can not help loving him . And to make men  | in love with goodness is to do them the greatest service that can be done or imagined . But one who does good in order that he may set us a good example is repellent to us . We do not desire to follow such an example . We realize that the man does not act so from pure love of goodness ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impressing us . We are impressed , but not as he desires . We are impressed with the conviction that he is a conceited prig , and the last thing we wish is to resemble him . Most of us would rather commit most of the sins in the calendar than justly be called a prig . And in this I submit that we are right ? at least by Christ 's standards . It is on record that the prigs of the first century were the only people who moved our Lord to intense disgust . He could not bear them . He liked better the publicans and the harlots . I do not think he liked their vices ; but I think he liked almost any kind of sinner better than the sinner who makes virtue detestable by self-consciously " setting a good example . " On one occasion the Pharisees asked him to forbid his disciples to pluck ears of corn on the Sabbath day . According to the rigor of the law , to pluck an ear of corn was to reap , and to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved rebuke . Our Lord refused to rebuke them . I think there are many religious leaders to-day who would have acted differently . Am I not right ? Would they not have said : " This is a trifle which you will surely sacrifice for the sake of others ? True , it is a trifle ; to pluck and eat a handful of corn is not really breaking the Sabbath . We all know that . Still , it is setting a bad example , and others ? younger and less thoughtful ? may easily be led into more serious breaches of the law , unless you are careful to be exact . " In almost these very words I have been urged to give up smoking . Heavens ! What a suffocating creed ! As if religion were an affair of such meticulous trifles ! One wants a little fresh air . It is true that I have St. Paul against me . But when St. Paul and his Master disagree , I must ( even on St. Paul 's authority ) still prefer Christ . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " If St. Paul tells me to set a good example to my weaker sisters ( Who , pray , are my weaker sisters ? ) and Christ refuses to tell his disciples to set one , I shall believe that Christ 's was the best advice . Truly a good example may be a burning and a shining light .  | " Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven . " There are men and women , themselves in love with goodness , whose grace and loveliness and power attract us like a magnet . And when we see them , we see that goodness is gracious and lovely . We desire it for ourselves . We realize ? sometimes , alas ! with a shock of surprise ? that " religion " is not a dull , meticulous , negative affair . It is not a matter of not drinking , not smoking , not gambling , not being licentious ; it is a radiant and an active thing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " light " does " so shine before us " that we glorify God and worship him . They make us in love with goodness ? which is God . If , then , I dare to offer a word of advice to my sisters of the American Protestant churches , it is with a most real admiration for the splendid and selfless vigor with which they set out to build the City of God . I have worked with and for associations of women whose zeal for this work is equaled by their courage , and with courage has gone statesmanship and wisdom . Every time I return to America I am more impressed by these qualities in American women . But I believe American Protestant religion lacks the spiritual depth and the sense of eternal things which comes only from intensive spiritual discipline . In other words , it has , in building the City of God , neglected the making of saints . There is a marvelous saying which the Fourth Evangelist puts into the mouth of Christ ? " For their sakes I consecrate myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at home in England ? the battlefield of the religious life , the earnest endeavor of high-minded people , full of the desire to serve . Not only in the Christian churches but in other organizations and " movements " the cause is lost again and again because , though it was a good cause , its leaders were not good enough . The task of building the City of God is a long and difficult one . We lose patience , we seek short cuts , we are content ( more or less ) with external remedies , we lose our own serenity , we grow confused , our sense of proportion disappears . The standards of the external world are so organized and articulate that it needs almost a new moral sense to see them with steady vision against the background of eternity . The astounding organization of public opinion , regimented by the press and the radio across a vast continent , can ? bring a moral bombardment against a single individual or society which , for the time being , is  | terrific . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do not need a biscuit merely because a poster tells us we do ; yet , in the end , the name of the biscuit rises automatically to our lips on some shopping expedition . We assure ourselves ? at least Americans assure me ? that they " do not believe a word they read " in a newspaper ; but I know , from personal experience , that quite a considerable number of people do believe even the most preposterous statements on no better authority than this . Knowing these things , reading these newspapers , listening in on a radio , watching the news on the screen at the movies ? bombarded on every side by sights and sounds , all expressive of this world 's standards and its passing shows , it becomes utterly impossible to " see life steadily and see it whole " without a conscious and continuous effort to see it in the light of God and to listen in the silence to his voice . THE VALUE OF SILENCE Yet this requires a great effort and an effort which easily seems a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost intolerable to Western people . An American woman , above all , is taught that her social success will depend largely on her ability to keep up a continuous flow of talk . The result is terrifying . How often during the last three months would I have given almost any price to be allowed to be silent ! Traveling through enchanting scenery , or in the darkness returning from a crowded meeting , I have instinctively relapsed into silence ? only to realize that my unhappy host was laboring to keep up a conversation and bitterly feeling that only an Englishwoman would expect a man to do all the work . One such toiler described to me a drive taken by a party of English people , plus himself and his wife , through some beautiful Devonshire valleys . " And if you will believe me , " he said , " there was no conversation but what my wife made ! " I blenched and awoke to a sense of my own delinquencies . In silence , meditation , and self-examination comes a clearer idea of where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it . Instead of bringing all our batteries to bear on some striking but superficial difference of taste or custom , we shall reserve our strength for our real enemies . The industrialization of life , mass production and mass standards , the cheapening of human personality , the menace of war ? to some of these , American religious leaders are now attentive .  | It is true that in this present world and generation the appeal to save our own souls has greatly lost its force . I sympathize with those to whom it seems selfish in itself and uninspiring in its object . But I believe the generation which has tried to save the world without saving itself is learning how futile is the attempt . The truth is that we are not fit to save anybody and are hardly fit even to serve them in the humblest capacity . The service of humanity is a most searching business . Under its terrible demands every weak and shoddy place in us , every lack of discipline , every unregulated impulse , every wasted ( and therefore now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least it would be , if we ever took time to look and consider . If we will not , we shall almost certainly lay the blame for our failure ? since it must be laid somewhere ? on the people we wanted to serve . No doubt it is partly the fault of the world that we do not more rapidly make it into the kingdom of heaven . But it is also partly our fault ; and it is our own fault that we are responsible for ? our own fault that we can deal with and overcome . Such dealing makes us wise too , for since we are part of that world we would serve , we shall be wiser to deal with it when we have dealt with ourselves . This generation of Christians , I believe , is finding out the real weakness of its religion . Several times I have had the joy of coming into contact with little groups of people who value both the discipline of silence and meditation , and its wealth . I have found a deep interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose object it is to provide for its members something of the individual spiritual discipline which organized church life rarely offers , while at the same time dispensing with organization as far as it is humanly possible . To have some place in one 's spiritual life for long silences , for discussion which is not debate , for worship in common but not in a crowd , is in no sense to compete with the full , regular , and stimulating life of church membership , but it is to supplement that life with something that is lacking in most churches and terrifying in its rigorous simplicity to many church goers . Perhaps out of the union of such a spiritual ideal with the generous ideal of active service ? the horror of spiritual selfishness , so characteristic of Christian America ? may come the saints who will at last build the City of God , who " for our sakes consecrate themselves .
