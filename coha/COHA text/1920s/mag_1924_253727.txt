" B. G. Lamme is dead . How many of our 112,000,000 know his name ? He was one of the four greatest electricians in the country . Edison , Tesla , and Steinmetz were the other three . Lamme and Steinmetz are gone . " <P> - ARTHUR BRISBANE , Hearst Editor . <P> At Ohio State University the young Benjamin Lamme studied electricity but slightly . He was a prodigy in mathematics - which explains his later power to perfect the most intricate inventions in his mind , without pencil or paper . Differential calculus and high-range multiplication were his diversions . Upon graduation , in 1888 , he entered the employ of the Westinghouse Co . He began inventing then , and stopped only at his death , after having given the world 150 useful devices . <P> His more important achievements : the " umbrella " generators to which the waters of Niagara Falls were first harnessed ; the high tension system of power transmission ; the synchronous converter employed on New York City subways for converting alternating to direct current ; the generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Y. , N. H. &; H. ) ; the single-phase alternating current ; the single reduction-gear streetcar motor , which , although designed in 1890 , is the type still used . His conception of the single-phase alternating-current railway system , now in universal use , is declared to have revolutionized the industry . The 62,500-kilowatt generator which he recently designed was larger than Steinmetz had conceded to be possible .
