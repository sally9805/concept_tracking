Two most distinguished Argentine jurists , Dr. Carlos Alberto Alcorta and Dr. Luis Podesta Costa , tried repeatedly and even frenziedly , last week , to obtain an audience with the new , silent and seclusive President of Argentina , Dr. Hipolito Irigoyen . <P> The jurists were not presuming , bumptious . They had every right and every reason to see Sphinx-President Irigoyen . The previous President of Argentina , Dr. Marcelo T. de Alvear , had appointed them Delegates to the Pan-American Conference on Arbitration and Conciliation which convenes in Washington on Dec. 10 , 1928 . Before leaving for Washington-and time was getting short-the Delegates must receive instructions from the Argentine Government as to what to do and say in Washington . <P> They could obtain no instructions . The President would not receive them . When they called repeatedly at the Foreign Office , the Minister was always in conference . Therefore , last week , Delegates Alcorta and Costa mailed their resignations . Officially there was no explanation . Perhaps President-elect Hoover will ask President Irigoyen , " Why ? " <P> Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new Argentine President and " boss politician " intimated recently ( TIME , Oct. 22 ) that he was vexed by reports that President Calvin Coolidge had made up his mind to raise the tariff on corn and flaxseed . Vexed anew , last week , was President Irigoyen when the Independent El Diario of Buenos Aires issued a presumptuous statement that it expects the government to refuse to sign the Kellogg Peace Pact on the grounds that Argentina is " a traditionally peaceful country .
