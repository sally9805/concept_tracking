txt The Catholic 4piscopate , acting through the venerable Archbishop of Mexico , the Most Rev. Jose More y del Rio , and Bishop Pascual Diaz , Secretary and official spokesman of the Episcopate , has made definite peace overtures to President Canes , as a special dispatch to Tax NEW YORK TIDIES yesterday announced they would do . In the name not only of the Catholic clergy but of- all loyal Mexican Catholics , the heads of the Church make a plea-for fin adjustment of the conflict between the Church and State , precipitated by the Government 's recent religious regulations . The Bishops declare they seek a solution of the controversy not only to regain the former rights of the Church but also for the sake of the peace and tranquillity of the entire nation . Calles Cited to Support Action . The Church leaders inform the President that their petition accords with the expressed ideas of Senor Calles himself , who , they point out , suggested a resort to the constitutional guarantee of the right of petition . They , therefore , request President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious articles in till Constitution and the regulatory laws until such time as action is taken to amend the Constitution and to repeal the laws that provoked the conflict . President Calles 's answer to the Bishops ' note has not been made pub , lic so far , and no indication of its nature has been revealed . It is generally I believed , however , that the Governmerit wall reiterate its stand that the religious laws must be strictly obeyed . Should the President so reply , the next move of the Church is problematical , but it will probably mean ian indefinite continuation of the deadlock between the Church and State . 1 Proposal Reid No Compromise . The action of the Episcopate in suggesting an adjustment of the situation came as a complete surprise to Mexico City and to the whole nation . I It is pointed out by Bishop Diaz that the Church makes no proposal to compromise , but seeks only a guarantee of the rights which it asserts were recognized by President Carranza and , so far as action was concerned , acquiesced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors of Carranza . The Episcopate is being flooded with messages from all parts of Latin America and from the United States urging it to stand firm , and surprise , therefore , is expressed that , in the face of these world-wide pledges of support and sympathy , a ' move for peace should have been initiated in the Archbishop 's palace at this time . The Bishops ' letter to the President declares that nothing could be more unjustified than the charge that the clergy are in rebellion against the laws . President Carranza , the prelates inform President Calles , . interpreted the religious laws as a violation of the rights of Catholic citizens and expressed support of a move to amend them so as to meet with the approval of the Church . But the move to reform the laws failed , says the letter , because of unsettled political conditions , this reference apparently being to the conditions which culminated in the death of Carranza . Text of the Letter . The letter , which was delivered late yesterday , reads : Mr. President : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishops and Bishops and Mexican Catholics , place before you , with all respect , the fol-lowing : We come using our constitutional rights , which were cited by you in your public statements published in the press on July 25 . ? But before we disclose our petition We believe it opportune that we refer with all sincerity to the two charges that have been made against the Church , one that we are in rebellion against the laws of the republic , and the other that we have not before used the right of petition , of which we now avail ourselves , to complain of the reform laws of the Constitution of 1857 , effective since 1873 and subsequently incorporated in the Constitution of 1917 . We have been charged with rebellion because we suspended public worship in the churches when the penal regulations became effective . Charges Declared Unjustified . There is nothing more unjustified . Refusal to commit an illegal act does not constitute rebellion . Citizens have the right to suspend the exercise of their profession when they conscientiously believe that the legal requirements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion , as " the use of one 's rights injures no one . " The conduct observed by the Catholic priests of the republic has harmonized with these rights since the day the laws went into effect . We believe that our conduct has been one of respect to the laws , in so far as our conscience will permit . In reference to the other charge , there are very strong arguments , the principal among them being that the . Government did not insist on the observance Of the reform articles of the Constitution , which were against the Church and the rights of Catholic citizens , and the State Governors , for one motive or another , did not insist on compliance with these articles , so that in practice there was created a mutual tolerance sufficiently elastic not to alter public tranquillity and to permit the Church a relative liberty to live and exercise her function . Carranza 's Stand Invoked . ? President Carranza , did not believe in the strict observance of the religious articles of the Constitution of 1917 , and he personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties to which Mexican Catholics were entitled as citizens of the republic . Senor Carranza officially proposed certain reforms of these articles , which were not realized because of unsettled political conditions well known to every one . Two successors of Senor Carranza also failed to enforce compliance with these articles . Therefore there was no occasion for a change in the attitude of the Catholic Church . Now , filled with the most sincere patriotism and desirous of a true and stable peace , we come to request you to use your influence so that there may be reform in the most effective manner of the articles referred to , naturally also , of the penal regulations which have been enforced . Suspension of Laws Asked . As this requires time and as a solution of the existing difficulties is very urgent , we believe we are authorized to petition you that you , in some manner , suspend the application of the latest law and of the constitutional articles so that the Church , school instructors and public charities may again enjoy the usual guarantees . The principle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to the true aspirations of the people , is that there be a sincere separation of Church and State , so that the Constitution and the organic laws and regulations will be a true interpretation of the aspirations of the people . Through this , the State will not dictate laws proscribing any religion , nor will it legislate in religious affairs , as , for example , determining the number of minis/prat ansl A will not stipulate the conditions for the exercise of the ministry , &c.; This harmonizes with a true interpretation of the civil law observed in all countries in which the independence of the temporal and spiritual powers is loyally respected . Requests Are Enumerated . Consequently , we request the following liberties : That we , as Christians , as citizens of a civilized nation and as men , have the right of liberty of conscience , of thought , of creed , of education , of teaching , of association and of the press . In a word , sincerely and without restrictions and without requesting privileges , we ask the recognition of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the aforementioned liberties may be effective . We have the most intimate conviction , which is also that of the Mexican Catholic people , that only in this manner can the ancient religious conflict , which has caused so much damage to the nation , be definitely terminated . It can not be doubted that this is the intense desire of all good Mexicans who are interested in the happiness of their country , and hiatory will record with just veneration the name of the Government which , in compliance with its duty , realizes so noble a work . JOSE MORA Y DEL RIO , Archbishop of Mexico and President of the Episcopal Committee . PASCUAL DIAZ , Secretary , Bishop of Tabasco . Mexico City , Aug. 16 , 1926 . Bishop Diaz Withholds Comment . Bishop Diaz , in making public the text of the letter , refused to comment on it , other than to say that the letter spoke for itself . Asked if he expected President Calles to agree to the Bishops ' suggestions , he smilingly replied : " Only time can answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
