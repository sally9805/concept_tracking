Those astronomers who specialize in planetary lore are enjoying a treat since Mars is now at its closest point to the earth . The actual date of nearest approach is Aug. 23 . At this time the planet is only 35 million miles away as against a possible distance of about 63 million miles when the two planets are at opposite sides of their orbits . These approaches , such as the present , occur every 26 months or so , but there is a variation of some 2 million miles in the nearness depending on what part of their eliptical orbits the two planets may be at the moment of juxtaposition . When the two planets are " in opposition , " as this is called , in last August the very best opportunity for observation is offered , although at that time only the south pole of Mars can be seen . <P> As usual the flood of newspaper buncombe about Mars and its inhabitants appears . The actual knowledge of the planet is considerable , as astronomical knowledge goes , but the amount of conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Mars is the planet whose orbit lies just outside that of the earth . Its mass is about one-ninth that of the earth . Its atmosphere has probably less than one-seventh the density of that of the earth . Because of its smaller mass , its gravity is much less and objects on its surface weigh only about one-third as much as the same objects would on the surface of the earth . It has also distinct polar caps , which increase and decrease with seasonable variations . It has also no marked clouds in its atmosphere . It has no surface elevations probably not over 2,000 or 3,000 feet in altitude . It has no oceans . Its year or period of revolution is close to 687 days ; its day is about 24 hours and 37 minutes . It has two satellites , very small , and very close to the planet , one of which rises and sets twice a day , one every other day . Because of the structure of its orbit there is a difference of about 40% in the amount of solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aside from this , on account of its light atmosphere , its temperature variations are great . <P> And then there are the canals . The presence of the major canals are fairly well established by a number of observations . The late Prof. Percival Lowell at his observatory at Flagstaff , Ariz. , claimed the discovery of as many as 585 canals . Some of these are doubted as optical illusions . These supposed canals were estimated at 30 to 100 miles in width and Prof. Lowell believed them to be belts of irrigated country close to canals . He believed further that they were supplied with water by the melting of the polar caps , and thought he dectected changes in the darkness and color of the canals indicating the coming and going of the water and its effect on vegetation . The whole supposition that there is animal life on Mars rests on the fact that the alleged canals are absolutely straight , running along great arcs of the planet 's surface . " How , " it is asked , " could these canals have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
