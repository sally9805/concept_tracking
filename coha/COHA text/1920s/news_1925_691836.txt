txt The Belgian and American Debt Commissions failed to reach an agreement at a brief meeting held this morning and further negotiations were put off until Tuesday afternoon . In the meantime the Belgian Cabinet will have an opportunity to study the reports which have been transmitted by the Belgian commissioners and it is hoped that definite instructions will be forwarded early next week . Because of this delay Secretary Mellon and Senator Smoot of the American commission decided last night to confer with President Coolidge at Plymouth during the week-end and hurriedly made arrangements for the trip . Secretary Mellon had planned to visit President Coolidge later at White Court , to go over matters pertaining to tax reductions . With the change of plans both tax reduction and the debt funding problem will be taken up at this time . ? Treasury officials indicated today that while an agreement on debt funding had not been reached , a number of obstacles had been overcome , and they continued to maintain an optimistic viewpoint . Belgium has agreed to fund both the prearmistice and post-ar#tistice debts withCitit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the total . The American commission , on the other hand , hsa consented to a moratorium on interest and to interest rates somewhat lower than those contained in the British-American settlement . But apparently the Belgian commission is not yet prepared to accept , as Within the country 's ability to pay , the interest rates which the American commission considers fair . At the opening of negotiations here it was understood that Belgium sought to have the United States cancel all of the accrued interest on her debt of $480.000 , -  |p00  , but thin was unacceptable to the American commissioners . The next effort was to reach an agreement on a reduction of the rate covering accrued interest , which would sharply cut down this item of the debt . An offer has been made by the American commission and one of the points to be determined is whether this finally will be accepted by the Belgians , or an even greaterconcPcsion demanded . Interest Rate Still undecided . The same question remains to be answered regarding interest rates to be paid from the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again has offered to consider rates lower than those in the British-American compact , but the Belgian commission , it is understood , does not feel that it is in a position to accept the terms unless favorable advices are received from the Brussels Cabinet . As yet such consent has not come , but it is hoped that there will be much clearer understanding when the commissions get together again on Tuesday . The American proposal , in some detail , will be placed before President Coolidge by Secretary Mellon and Senator Smoot , along with the arguments which the Belgian commissioners have made for even more lenient terms , and his opinion obtained as to the extremes of the concessions to which the American commission should agree . The commission feels that it is of vital importance that the President 's approval be obtained in advance , if great concessions are to be made , as the whole matter will have to come before Congress for approval in the event an agreement is reached .
