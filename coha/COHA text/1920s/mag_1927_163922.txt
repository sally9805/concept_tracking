From the Straits Settfements , a Crown colony comprising Singapore , Penang and Malacca , news came last week that the local British administration derives some 2,500,000 ( $12,150,000 ) annually from opium revenues . Opium , called locally chandu , was reported on sale at $8 an ounce , in " smoke parlors " operated by the government , whereas the government imports tin drug from China for less than $1 an ounce . During 1925 almost $300 000 was spent by the government in building new and more luxurious " smoke parlors " which are now reported in full blast . The natives , accustomed to chandu , apparently feel no more than a slight " head " on the day following an evening of indulgence .
