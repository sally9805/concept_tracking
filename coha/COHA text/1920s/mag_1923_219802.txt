A Ray of Sunshine in Europe <P> Herr Cuno , German Chancellor , made his expected reparations offer of 30,000,000,000 gold marks ( $7,140,000,000 ) . This amount is only the vanguard of the real German offer which will be 50,000,000,000 gold marks ( $11,900,000,000 ) , representing the maximum amount Germany can pay . <P> The Germans , as well as the rest of the world , knew that a small offer would be unacceptable to the French and Belgians before they made it . Their sole aim was to create a pied a terre for future discussion and settlement of the vexatious reparations problem . It can not now be denied that a ray of sunshine has broken through the dark clouds overhanging Europe . <P> It must not be supposed , however , that the machinery , having been oiled , will move with marked rapidity . The outlook is favorable , but some time is sure to elapse before events shape themselves to the political mould . <P> News from Germany tends to corroborate the prognostication that Cuno will resign in the near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in the solution of the whole Ruhr and reparations question . <P> It must be borne in mind that the thirty billion offer is the direct outcome of the Stinnes proposals in Italy . For the reason that the industrialists are anxious to bring about peace in the Ruhr , a Stinnes nominee will , in all probability , form a cabinet after the predicted fall of Herr Cuno has taken place . The Stinnes man is Herr Stresemann , political head of the People 's Party , which is in reality controlled by the industrialists . It seems reasonable to suppose that Stresemann would receive support of the Socialist Party , who are known to favor an early settlement with France-particularly as no other party seems anxious to take the responsibility of forming a new government . <P> France , seconded by an apparently concurring Belgium , refused point blank to entertain the German offer . It was clearly an impossible figure for her to accept , considering that her share would only amount to about $3,700,000,000 . Belgium , committed with France in the Ruhr struggle , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decline Germany 's offer , although it is known that she is very strongly in favor of a definite settlement . <P> The French and Belgians in their reply to the German offer stated that " The German note from one end to the other is only a thinly veiled ex- pression of systematic revolt against the Treaty of Versailles . " They ask now for the cessation of passive resistance in the Ruhr before any negotiations can take place . They refused the thirty billion gold mark offer , stating that it was inadequate and lacking tangible guarantees . <P> From a semi-official source it is learnt that Poincar , in conjunction with M. Theunis of Belgium , will have a Franco-Belgian counter reparations plan ready by May 15 . He will then place it before the Chamber of Deputies and demand a vote of confidence on it .
