THE outbreak of the European war came seventeen months after the death of the elder Mor-gan . At the time , the power and prestige of the House , under the younger Morgan , were being seriously threatened by Kuhn , Loch &; Company and other private banking houses who were openly going after Morgan business . The war helped Morgan &; Company ; end Morgan &; Company , more than any other single financial force , saved the Allies . Terrific responsibilities were placed suddenly upon the comparatively untried Morgan . The war forced him to reverse sharply his announced policy of conducting in future merely " a bond and security business upon a strict commission basis . " England , financial bag-holder for the allied nations of Europe , recognized only Morgan &; Company in American finance . All Europe ( with the exception of the Central Powers ) and a large part of America turned to Morgan &; Company for financial succor . Panic threatened New York . The municipality owed London scores of millions . London demanded payment in gold . Sterling exchange rocketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first test and he met it ably . He and his cabinet took hold , advanced gold credits and averted the crisis just as his father , by bringing gold out of hidden vaults , had halted the panic of 19117 . Soon Morgan &; Company was drawn into the maelstrom of the European conflict . Sentimentally and socially , the sympathies of the firm were on the side of the Allies . By 1915 France and England were in desperate need of American gold . The scholarly Lord Reading headed a mission to America and asked Morgan to form a syndicate and sell one billion dollars of five per cent , five year securities . No such stun had ever before been even mentioned in international finance . The evening of the mission 's arrival in America , Morgan entertained Lord Reading at dinner in the old Morgan mansion at Thirty-sixth Street end Madison Avenue . Reading and his host adjourned for coffee to the spacious , old-fashioned study on the second floor . Business had not previously been mentioned . The financier and the British statesman were old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pipe he smokes the same brand of strong , expensive thunderbolts his father used ) and remarked , as casually as though speaking of the weather : " Reading , I would n't ask a billion if I were you . I think you 'd be wiser to limit your first large bond issue to half a billion . " It is a striking illustration of the confidence the allied leaders had in the far-sighted judgment of the House of Morgan that Lord Reading at once accepted the American 's advice . I.Vhde the allied mission was crossing the Atlantic , Morgan and his partners had made a careful survey of the investment market and Morgan had in his pocket estimates from all over the country showing America 's ability and inclination to absorb an allied loan . This loan was the beginning of international finance on a new scale . Other vast operations followed . The same year ( 1915 ) Morgan &; Company was appointed purchasing as well as fiscal agent of the Allies in the United States . It bought munitions and food supplies to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mnnth amounts greater than the entire commerce of the world for a like period a generation before . The terrific strain of the job broke the constitu tions and eventually hastened the deaths of Henry P. Davison and Edward R. Stettinius . But Morgan , steel-nerved , iron-muscled , handled his share of the vast enterprises with frictionless efficiency . His self-discipline was the marve of his associates . Each evening he dropped the awful rispoirsibilities of the day , went motoring or cruised briefly in the Corsair . DURING this period it madman forced his way into 11.1organ 's Glen Cove hiime with a gun , and fired at Morgan . Although painfully woundedintheehdornen , Morgan shielded his wife , hurled himself at the intruder and disarmed the as-cadent before he himself collapsed . A few weeks later , fully recovered , Morgan arrived at his office at noon , unheralded and unguarded . Fifteen minutes before his accustomed hour of departure t four o'clock ) an ii itinnolide drew up in front of The Corner . A crowd collected . Morgan walked alone to the machine . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brim of his hat , and waved his hand . Evenings , during those anxious days , his only companions were Mrs. Morgan end George F. Baker , aged friend of his father and dean of Wall Street , Morgan 's relations with Baker are almost those of son and father . Two years sign , when Ile learned that Baker was ill et Jekyll Island , Georgia , Morgan advanced the time of his usual winter vacation and motored south to see him . TN spite of his human qualities , Mor- i gan is tactless and absolutely lacking in diplomacy After his father 's death , he ordered almost immediate sale of the priceless paintings housed in the specially constructed Morgan Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Stunned officials of the Museum first learned of Morgan 's act through the newspapers . The hanker was bitterly criticized . It was his first real bath in antagonistic ink . He treated the attacks contemptuously , scorning the slightest attempt at defence . Years later one of his partners confided that Morgan sold the paintings be-cause he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate was but nineteen million dollars and there were an inheritance tax of three millions and many other large expenses to he met . There is similar explanation . his friends say , for another incident that caused him to he attacked by the press . Some years ago Morgan was subpoenaed to testify before the so-called Walsh Industrial Relations Committee of Congress . One of the questions Walsh asked was : " Do you consider ten dollars a week proper wage for a longshoreman ? " Bluntly , Morgan replied : " If that 's all he can get and he takes it , I should say that is enough . " The sentence rang around the country . Almost as many stinging editorials were written about it as about Commodore Vanderbilt 's famous " public be damned " phrase . Yet the reply did not represent Morgan 's real viewpoint . He did not and does not believe that ten dollars a week is sufficient wage for any man . He was merely venting his irritation at being unnecessarily dragged from his desk ( as he viewed the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and took the stand , he was infuriated to discover himself the centre of a forest of motion-picture cameras . He lost his temper and tittered an expression he has since regretted , though he would be the last to admit regret . Friends say J. P. is warm , jovial , and generous-natured at heart . Once a junior employee stole a sum of money . The youth confessed and was headed for Sing Sing , apparently . Morgan heard of the matter and summoned the boy 's mother . She came into his office weeping . " Ilf nv , now , none of that , " ordered the banker brusquely . " Your son wo n't he sent to jail . I will get him another job and keep an eye on him . " MORGAN thus far has successfully repulsed the thrusts of publicity . He guards his inner life from all save a privileged few . Above all else , he is a family man . He adored his wife , Jane Norton Grew Morgan , whose brother , Edward , was a classmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grew , was a banker , mill owner , and financier of Boston . She married Morgan in 1890 , a year after the latter had received his diploma . Morgan was eighteen when he became a Harvard freshman . He roomed at Beck Hall alone . Here had lived many other wealthy and famous sons of Harvard , amon2. them Theodore Roosevelt , who later entered into deadly feud with Morgan senior . In his last year at Harvard , Morgan was manager of the annual Hasty Pudding Club show . The production that year was Sheridan 's comedy , " The Duenna . " With Morgan in charge it was a big success . Harvard has received many gifts from her famous alumnus and in 1923 his alma mater bestowed on him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws . He frequently attends class reunions . " The chief change in my condition since me last report to the class of ' 89 is me promotion to the position of grandfather , " he told his classmates in 1918 . He thanked the Harvard authorities for his appointment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs the one I liked best . " He was referred to as " Mr. Morgan " when asked to make a speech on the subject : " Of what earthly use are overseers ? " " Oh , hell , call me Jack , " interjected Morgan . On this occasion the class poet read some lines on the overseer , beginning : " First comes the Great Lord Morgan hark how the trumpets crash ! Striding along with a heavy air , cutting an awful dash . " -M ago RS. after M a lingering eri died g four siege year sears l aeegping sickness . Since then , the banker has retreated more and more within himself . He attends the theatre or opera not half a dozen times a season , though his box at the Metropolitan is generally occupied by members of the family or friends . He is , however , passionately devoted to yachting , now about his only outdoor diversion , and is never so happy as when pacing the deck of the Corsair , especially during a squall . He rowed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale-Harvard race . Once he played a great deal of tennis , and even now he occasionally takes part in a doubles match with his family . Also , a few times a year , he joins a family foursome at golf . He was one of the founders of the Creek Club at Locust Valley and occasionally dines there with Clarence Mackay , Harry Payne Whitney , or other close friends . He still deeply mourns his wife . Her room at Matinicock Point , over the library and to the left of the porch , is just as she left it . Something of the depth of affection between Mr. and Mrs. Morgan is shown in her will . The document left most of her property to her two sons and two married daughters but the will contains this unusual sentence : " I feel sure that if , through any unforeseen cirat his office until after eleven ; but often , before he motors to town or rides the Corsair across the Sound to the New York Yacht Club landing at the foot of Last Twenty-sixth Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little corner of the beautiful gardens that Mrs. Morgan herself tended , and plies shovel and rake . Mrs. Morgan loved tulips and raised many varieties . Annually and invariably Morgan 's tulips win awards at many horticultural shows . Mrs. Morgan was an old-fashioned housewife . There has never been a feeling of caste in the rambling three-story house nn Matinicock Point , which is one of the few occupied by families of great wealth where strict immobility is not required of the servants . Often a footman or butler will set a lifted dish hack on the serving table and smilingly await the completion of a dinner-table joke or anecdote . Then the servant joins in the general laughter without rebuke . MORGAN 1S a diligent student of the Bible and of Shakespeare , and often surprises associates by copious and accurate quotations from these source-founts of literature . Ele is also an authority on the art treasures collected by his father and himself . Since the former 's death he has added more than four thousand to the nineteen thousand volumes and manuscripts in the greatest private library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of his time to art dealers and bibliophiles . Morgan senior spent half a century assembling his art treasures . res . Five years ago , the son deeded the library to the public as a memorial to his father . Its use is necessarily restricted to scholars , since many of the rare manuscripts are not in condition to be handled much longer . Often , afternoons , Illorgan deserts the money marts and drives to the library , where he reads and browses for hours , frequently remaining long after the departure of Miss Belle do Costa Green and the latter 's assistant librarian , Miss Ada Thurston . The , great room of the library is one of the mast romantic chambers in the world . Milton , as a boy , painted by Cornelius Janssen , looks down upon galleries , shelves , and tables containing treasures of queens and courtesans , popes and kings , scholars and statesmen . In this beautiful setting , each Christmas Eve , a few close friends and members of the family , including the older of the eleven Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas Carol , " from the original manuscript in the handwriting of Charles Dickens . The custom was initiated by the first J. Pierpont Morgan when Jack Morgan and his sister , Anne , were children . Morgan 's interest in Biblical lore has brought him some unusual associations . He and Pope Pius XI correspond regularly . When the financier is in Rome , he turns as soon as possible from the hustle and bustle of the revivified Mussolineaa metropolis and drives to the Vatican . The Pontiff leads the way to an inner den where he and his distinguished guest from overseas sit about informally and discuss  --  Coptic manuscripts ! The friendship began when Pope Pius , then Monsignor Ratti , undertook the labor of restoring sixty volumes written in Coptic , or medieval Egyptian script , and dating hack to the seventh century . Two years before his death Morgan senior  --  in Italy he was called admiringly " II Magnifico , the modern , Lorenzo de ' Medici " ? enlisted the aid of Monsignor Ratti in making legible the tattered pages . 11 Magnifico had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coptics were discovered in a dry well attached to the ruined monastery of St. Michael the Archangel in Fayum , Egypt . Pope Pius is perhaps the greatest living authority on early Christian documents . He and expert manuscript restorers stiffened the crumbling parchment with gelatin ; and the writing so cleared up that nearly all of it can now be read . In 1 923 , after twelve years of uncertainty , the Pope sent the restored volumes to the younger Morgan . They now occupy cabinets of honor in the Morgan Memorial Library . Ten complete photographic copies of the original volumes have been deposited in the leading museums and libraries of the world ; and students of exegesis pore over them , eagerly searching out differing versions of the New Testament . REmEmBERiNG his father 's nervous and physical breakdown in his mid-seventies , Morgan guards his health . He has no dissipations and carefully regulates his manner and method of life . Because of the increasing frequency of his trips to England , he maintains a fully-staffed home at 12 Grosvenor Square , London , W.1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive table ready for dinner , the covers of his bed turned hack , curtains drawn , lights ready to turn on , and ash tray and book placed beside the bed . Incidentally , if the book is the latest crime thriller , Morgan will be pleased . Like so many other men of burdens , he frequently turns to detective fiction for relief . Morgan has no intention of dying in harness . It is noticeable of late years that he and his older associates have picked young partners , men in the early forties or even younger . The oldest Morgan son , Junius Spencer ( they call him " Junior " at 23 Wall ) is destined to succeed to the chieftainship of the house . Junius has a dry , biting humor , much on the order of the great-grandfather for whom he was named . Be is now one of the most important of the partners . The other Morgan son , and youngest of the four children , is Henry Sturgis . After five years of apprenticeship in the tough school at 23 Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with young Henry Pomeroy Davison and Thomas Stilwell Lamont . Harry Morgan is twenty-eight , Davison thirty , Lamont twenty-nine . True to tradition , Harry Morgan started as a messenger . After two years he worked his way into a clerkship . Really worked his way . No Morgan ever raised his son to soldier . Even though he now has a job yielding , it is said , at least a million a year , Harry may be seen any afternoon swinging along towards the subway puffing at a pipe . In appearance he differs not at all from hundreds of other hustling youngsters in the financial district . Undoubtedly the head of the firm looks forward eagerly to the time when he may transfer his burdens and responsibilities to his sons . Pr HE J. Picrpont Morgan of today 1- is a massive , deep-chested , graying-haired man who paces restlessly beneath the frowning oil portrait of his father at 23 Wall Street . Paces restlessly , for at heart this Morgan is not a money king . He is more essentially a student , a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens of his position , good-humoredly and capably , because these burdens were thrust upon him . If the traditions of his family had permitted , friends say , he would have preferred a more cloistered life . The drift of Morgan 's mind is towards study , contemplation , and the quiet pursuits of a country gentle-
