 | TWENTY years ago , when I came to live in the country , I was as ignorant of birds as most Londoners and many country people are . I had been blissfully aware of the melodies of the country side and was inclined to claim that they were the more enchanting for being anonymous ; but in looking back now , it seems to me that I was deaf as well as blind ; for who would say that any one who did not know whether they were listening to Bach or Beethoven really heard music , or that any one who did not distinguish a Chardin from a Velasquez saw pictures ? The mere naming , evidently , has no value ; but it represents a new power of discrimination , and from the pleasurable chaos of unformulated impressions we draw , for a deeper enjoyment , the definite forms of each special beauty . Until one can distinguish the songs of the different birds one can not really hear them , and once known they become one of the greatest pleasures of life -- and a pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I watch a fly-catcher hovering with upstretched wings , if any Pavlowa or Karsavina can offer so exquisite a spectacle , and listening to the delicate melody of the willow-warbler , dropping among the leaves like a tiny chain of crystals , I have thought that jazz itself was dated . Why not sit down at home , in our - own garden , and look about us with a pair of field-glasses , and listen for an hour or two ? If we are rewarded only by the bubbling song of the chaffinch or the sight of the wren , with tiny upturned tail , slipping in and out of the hawthorn hedge , we shall have gained a fresher sense of the value of peace and solitude . This little paper , written for my American readers , can , alas ! share with them none of their bird memories . My early childhood in America was , as regards birds , completely blind and deaf ; I have no recollection of them at all ; and even when I returned for a visit , twentyfive years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember a flock of delicious bright blue birds that flew before us , when I was being driven behind a Kentucky trotter along a road in Ohio ; and hoped for hermit-thrushes in the Massachusetts woodlands . Mr. Frank Chapman , whose books on American birds I had read before I met him , and whose friendship I owe to birds , promises me that if I can come again he will take me to a spot in the Adirondacks where I shall hear them singing from May till August .  | I have a dim memory , too , from this visit , of the handsome American robin , very different from our chubby little English bird , though both have a red breast ; it was this resemblance , no doubt , that led the homesick Pilgrim Fathers to name the red-breasted thrush of America after the familiar bird of home . And let me here urge upon my American readers , for the sake of international amity , that the so-called " English " sparrow is no more English than French or German . He is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwanted everywhere , except , perhaps , in the dingiest of city streets . Winter Watching But to return to my bird education . It began with the feeding of birds in winter , and I do not think that there is a better way to begin , for one may sit at leisure indoors and watch the birds assemble at the feeding ground outside . I was thus engaged one day when my eye was caught by a parrot-bright little bird , green , black and yellow , with a white cheek and glossy , blue-black head ; a bold , rather rakish bird . I had tended to find all birds very much alike until I saw the great tit , just as I had protested to the patient teacher of my walks that I could really hear no difference between the song of the wren and the chaffinch ; but after I had examined the great tit , delighted , while he picked up the crumbs and flew off with them , and been told that he belonged to a family comprising seven or eight species in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up bunches of bacon-rind on the creepers outside the window . I soon came to know the darling if somewhat shabby little Cole tit , and the lovely blue tit with his sapphire head , lemon breast , and blue-gray back . The blue is the commonest of all the tits here , and as exquisite , as absurd and endearing in the world of birds , as a Pomeranian is in the dog world . Indeed all the tits , except the rather stalwart great , remind me of Poms ; tiny , buoyant , careless , their looping flight the equivalent of his pricking step , their sharp chick-a-dee-dee , of his bark , while there is an actual physical resemblance between the high head and minute bill and the Pom 's sharp little nose and innocent , wind-swept forehead . The tit is called a chickadee in America , and chickadee and tit are admirable alternative names for a Porn ; you could not call a pug , a Sealyham , or a Pekinese by either ! The marsh and willow tits are almost indistinguishable ; adorable little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts , but of all the tits there is none so captivating as the long-tailed . His little body is hardly larger than a walnut , and his tail three or four times as long . They are fantastically exquisite to watch as they zigzag down a hedge , swinging to hang upside down from a twig , rather as a minute soap-bubble swing= round the pipe it is blown from , to hang and sway with its balanced lightness ; always in a family , so that their happy conversational zeezee seems to trail a gossamer thread behind them as they go . Dawn-pink breasts , chocolate backs , ruffled , innocent countenances with tiniest bills and largest round eyes , there is nothing that I know of comparable to them in the bird world , for the tiny gold-crest , so like them in habit , and lovely with the butterfly eye upon his wing , has not their miraculous tail . It was in the same winter that I grew really familiar with the robin , best known of all English birds and one that could perhaps least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the year round , and his silvery song can be heard from earliest autumn and all the winter and spring . He comes so confidently to the window for crumbs , and follows the garden spade in the borders so imperatively for worms , that he seems almost a household pet ; delicate of leg , high of head , washed well over his brows with ruddy color . He has a delicious little knick of pallor , as of a finger-tip pressed among the  | feathers , where the red melts into pearl-color on the lower breast . His song , falling often from high trees , reminds me always of shattered silvery spears , such spears as a Blake angel night use , and he is heard singing when all other birds are silent , so that a strange poignancy , as if of regret and pleading , is added to the sweetness . During the next spring I came at last to distinguish the songs of the thrush and blackbird . The world of bird-lovers is divided on the question of which is the lovelier . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eager , exultant song , with its mazurka-like cadences , its splendid variety and inventiveness , shows greater mastery and resource . It seems impossible to think that I did not at first distinguish them , for one phrase of either , one note even , is now so evidently characteristic to my ear . The pitch of the blackbird 's song is lower , of a more golden tone ; his phrase is one long arabesque , indolent , desultory almost , laid out as if with loving deliberation on the silence of early dawn when , after the skylark 's prelude , his is usually the first song that we hear . The thrush is all ardent reiteration and seems to celebrate present delight ; the blackbird , to brood over remembered happiness . " My darling ! ? My darling ! ? My darling ! ? Come to me ! Come to me ! Come to me ! " sings the thrush ; while the blackbird says , " Do you remember our first meeting , beloved ? " I symbolize the songs by these amorous words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds are essentially amorous ; they seem more analogous to what one might call hymns of praise , Magnificats . Field-Glasses Find Friends I like having my field-glasses with me when I go for my walks . A bird is rarely seen in detail unless seen through them , and it is peculiarly delightful to have it thus " perched on one 's thumb " ( as our bird-loving neighbor Warde Fowler expressed it ) and isolated in its own small circle of universe , the spangled goldfinch on his thistle , a slip of blue sky behind ; the stone-chat on the tip of a golden gorze spray , with black head , red breast and high white collar ; the wheat-ear perched on a clod in the plowed autumnal field , the bullfinch as he sits gravely , contentedly picking one 's plum-buds to pieces on a circle of gray March sky , his azalea pink breast as lovely in the misty air as any flower . Who would not give all the plums of a summer for the sight of three cock and three hen bullfinches , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The hen , a delicately lovely reproduction in a warm grisaille of the cock 's rose and white and gray . One winter brought the lesser and the greater spotted woodpeckers to our garden . We watched the lesser as he fiercely , insistently , tapped his way down the larch paling , hurriedly , accurately , searching insects in the lichen . The checkered black and white of his back was like a Chinese pattern , and only a Chinese palette could have reproduced the depth and richness of his whites and blacks and vermilions . The greater spotted , larger , and even more splendid in coloring and design , haunted a pile of logs in the orchard all through the winter , but we have not seen these beautiful birds now for years . Years also have passed since I heard a nightingale . One used to sing in a lane not far from our house , and on late summer evenings we made more than one pilgrimage to listen to it . It is certainly the most romantic , even dramatic bird-song that I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated note , beginning on what is almost a whisper of happiness ? or grief ? and rising , deepening to passionate urgency of prayer and protest . But when we came home after the war , the hedge had been cut , and the nightingale nested there no longer . Strangely enough , it was in France , where they net and eat their small birds in winter and  | seem to have little of the feeling for them so widely spread in England and America , that I had many of my happiest bird experiences . have never seen or heard so many warblers as in France . Delicate and unobtrusive as they are , and arriving at a time of year when people are not thinking much of fritures , they escape molestation , and every wood and orchard is full of them . It was in a Normandy orchard that I first saw and heard the blackcap poised on a spray of apple-blossom , so near that not only could I delight in every shade of his silvery white and ashen gray , and mark the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , but actually could look down his orange throat as he sang out , loudly and ecstatically , his joyous , solitary phrase . No one has defined it better than sober , simple Gilbert White , " a full , sweet , deep , loud and wild pipe " ; for wildness is of the essence of it , and it seems to wander among the branches in a rapture of loneliness . like the voice of a spirit released from every earthly tie and forgetful of them all . In a lower orchard the babbling song of the garden warbler was almost always to be heard . ' One could sit in deep shade on a summer day and listen to the delicious , brook-like monotone , running like rippling water among the leafage . The angelic wood warbler I have heard only twice , once in a wooded valley above the Correze , and once in a Wiltshire beech-grove . Not only is its song singularly seraphic , but , with its trembling , drooping wings and upstretched throat , it looks like a seraph while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their settings . A blackcap was singing marvellously outside Amboise Castle when I was there , the great walls perhaps lending resonance to the song ; and another sang as I have never heard a blackcap sing before or since in the great old chestnut tree said to have been planted by Francois Premier , on the high terrace at Loches . The song seemed to celebrate the beauty , and the beauty to . enhance the song . In the French Country Redstarts are far more common in France than with us . I used to watch one in my Normandy orchard , with its starry azure forehead and flame-colored tail , and the black redstart , so inappropriately called the rossignol des murailles , haunts every French country town . He is a charming little bird to look at , poised against a steep tiled roof , with his dusky head and breast and fiery tail ; but his song is singularly charmless ? and can even become annoying when one wants to sleep at dawn and is kept awake ? as I was one morning at Chartrist ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the shivering of a stout tumbler against a stone . Gray water wagtails were abundant in the small French watering-place where , during the war , we worked in a hospital . Daffodil yellow beneath ? and two shades of yellow , as the daffodil has two shades ? soft gray above . they tilted and waded in the shallow brooks that ran on either side of the street , or exquisitely displayed their black and white pinions as they fluttered and turned in the air above the mill-stream . More than any other bird , they are like beautiful balletdancers , elongated , elegant , the tilt of the long tail not at all unlike the absurd yet charming swaying of the dancer 's tulle skirt as she runs across the stage . The French call these lovely wagtails bergeronnettes , as they are often seen in pastures among the cows , and the pied wagtail is the lavandiere , a name derived from the movement of the wooden implement with which the French washerwomen beat their linen at the river 's edge , a movement shared by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagtail 's song here in my garden , on an aspen tree outside the drawing-room window . Whether I should recognize it again I do not know , for it was years ago ; but I @#  | remember that it was full of liquid turns and cadences and seemed part of the pale spring sky and pale leaves among which he sat . The daily commonplaces of bird life are all welcome to the bird-lover , but it is specially delightful to see some unexpected picture , such as the pied wagtails gave me once in early spring , when the floods were out in the lower meadows below our house . One sees pied wagtails , as a rule , only as individuals ; but here was a flock of them sporting in a sheet of bright blue water that lay like a miniature lake along the grass . They ran in and out of the water , splashed it , as they bathed , into silver spray , and fluttered and flashed in the sunny air above it . And I have an autumnal picture to match with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woods , some miles away , on an October afternoon , I chanced to look through a thicket and saw in a rough , disused pasture what was nothing less than a bird 's fairy-tale party . 1 One is accustomed to seeing lapwings in flocks , and here were myriads of them , and blackbirds and thrushes , assembled as if for the pleasure of companionship . Lapwings , with their beautiful crested heads , always look like enchanted princesses to me , their stately pause like that of a princess awaiting her courtiers , and the forward poise of their swift run like that of a princess , pursued , but still gracefully managing her train . They stood grouped in little companies or couched peacefully upon the ground , while the blackbirds and thrushes ran in and out from the hedges and bathed in the shallow pools lying among the brambles ; and one tall heron stood contemplatively in the midst . I gazed for a long time , and then some involuntary gesture betrayed me , for suddenly , with one accord , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blues and grays turning to black and silver on the sky . The blackbirds and thrushes hastened to cover , and the heron sailed away , his long legs trailing behind him . All settled , no doubt , to resume their interrupted musings in a farther , solitary pasture , and I turned back to my long walk home , accompanied by the peace and contentment of that happy spectacle .
