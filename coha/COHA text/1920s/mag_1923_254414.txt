A French professor , Charles Henri , has discovered a method of " aging " wine in a few minutes . In a demonstration before the Academy of Sciences , he took a bottle of new wine , and by placing it for a few minutes in an electrostatic field of from 60,000 to 100,000 volts , changed it in a short time so that in all respects - strength , color , bouquet-it could not be detected from old wine . Steps have been taken to commercialize the new invention . <P> Hudson Maxim , the inventor , suggested to the National Cotton Conference for Boll Weevil Control that inasmuch as insects are guided by smell , it might be possible to destroy the boll weevil by baiting traps with the scent of the female . If the method could be developed it might be made effective against the house fly , mosquito , ant , and other pests . <P> A new planetoid , or tiny planet , was discovered at the United States Naval Observatory . About a thousand planetoids have been already discovered . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Orion .
