txt When the Chicago encountered difficulty in getting off the glassy stealer of Kagoshima bay , and when Smith signaled the rest of us to push right en to China , we headed the New Orleans and Boston straight steams the open sea , and for six solid heurs flew ? entirely out of sight of ' land . This was our longest sea jourley-up until this time , ' says Erik Nel. , on . who was the only one of the world flyers familiar with the China coast . As a sailor before the mast Erik had Resent weeks idling. in these- waters . over which he now flew in a few - heurs . " With the shores of beautiful Japan and the cone of Sakurajtma rapidly - melting into the  --  sky behind us , I am ' sure the thoughts of all of us were on what an interesting time we had passed in the land of the Mikado , of : what a relief Japan had been after coming down from the edge of the Afctic , of the honors that had been heaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . It was all so wonderful that we were in a bit of a daze . Conducive to Thinking . ?

But when they When it came time on June to leave Kagishima for China a dead II calm prevailed , and only the ; Veto Or leans was able to leave the water . It flew to Shanghai alone . It was not until June 13 that the other two could leave Japan and fly to Shanghai . The mouth of the Yangtze river was filled , with native boats in great profusion , which huttlerisily added to the danger in taking off . The panes left Shanghai on June S , but with so light a load of gasoline that they heal ? put in at Tchimkocnt bay , a short distance down the Chine coast , for fuel . saw us land on their island after having flown all the way across the Paeine , and when they realized that their country was merely one of twenty- , eight counti.es we were to visit on our flight , they seemeal to wake up to the possibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry and his American fleet opened the doors of Japan to the cons merge of the world just a little over a half century ego They put in orders for the building of fleets of airplanes and for the construrtion of airships twice the size ea the Shenandoah and ZR-3 , of which We are so proud . ? Destroyers Guard Path . " Part of the time while speeding across the Yellow sea I did nothing but think and let Jack take the wheel . We often relieved each other like that . Nor is there a more ideal place in the world to think than in the cockpit of a plane as you race across the sky at seventy , or one hundred , or one hundred and fifty miles art hour . If the sky is clear and you are high enough from the earth not to be interested in the affairs of the world below , and if your motor is singing a melody of power that Is one long rhythmical harmony to your ears , you and your plane seem to merge into one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brain and you can do more clear thinking in two hours than you can do in two days in a croft ded city . " We had left Kagoshima bay at 5:25 in the morning . A half hour later we bad reached the open sea . Our flight had been across the water at the place where the Yellow and China seas merge into one . One hour off the coast we , pasted over the Ford , which was the first of the string of destroyers strung all the way across to China to be on hand in case of engine trouble . We passed nine other destroyers beems the Ford , and when forty miles off the China coast we could tell that we were approaching the mouth of a great river . Most of the way the sea had been a deep blue . Then it changed to green and we knew that it was much shallower . But as we neared the mainland of Asia it all of a sudden turned a muddy . brown . Yangtze Divides China . " This indicated to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest rivers in the world , the Yangtze Kiang , e river longer than the distance from San Francisco to New York The Yangtze Kiang is the Mississippi of Cnina and divides the country into two parts . Tens of millions of people live on its shores , and millions actually live their entire lives on its broad expanse In houseboats , . sampans , and junks . Among the cities on its banks am Shanghai , about the size of Philadelphia : Nanking . nearly as large as Boston ; Hanitow , which is as large as St. Louie and New Orleans combined ; Soocliow , in the delta , about the size of Detroit , and a score of others all over /00.000 in population . " As we flew across the mouth-of the river and drew near Shanghai we wore amazed at the number of Ohiness water craft under us . Tho river seemed Jammed with tens of thousands of junks , sampans , and steamers . I had seen nothing like this on my previous visit to China , long years before . But we found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all traffic in the river for hours . Just In one bunch there were over 250 boats loaded with fish , and they did not represent one hundredth of 1 per cent of alt that vast mass of water craft . The harbormaster had n't known just how much space we would require , so he had cleared several miles in order tn ' , t we would be sure not to repeat the experience of D'Olsy , the French airman , who only a few days before had : trashed on the outskirts of Shanghai , " Our American friends had - worried greatly for fear that In coming down In the harbor we would smash up on a sampan or junk . Capt . Eisler had spent sleepless nights thinking about it . This was the main subject of con versatiun , and every one seemedmuch relieved to see us arrive withoutcrashing . Change Motor Exhausts . " On our-way across the Yellow sea the exhaust pipe on the right hand side of my cmgine had gotten so hot that the rubber had all burned off the ignition wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two longer we might have had serious trouble and plunged Into the sea . During our brief stay in Shanghai we had new exhaust stacks , short open ones , - put on all the planes . We had been hawing trouble with the long ones cracking , getting strained , and burning out the exhaust gaskets . I succeeded in arranging with a machine shop in a Chinese shipyard to work night and daymaking the short stacks and from then on we had no more trouble . " Immediately after the reception on the boat we rowed back to our planes and went to work . In doing so we disappointed people ashore who had arranged an even more elaborate reception . We ? learned afterwards that the reserve militia , on horseback and In full regalia , were waiting on dress parade to receive us . But it was long after dark when we finished our work . Of course we much disliked disare pointing people , but I am afraid this occurred in. many cities . Great . Reception at Hotel . " When we ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astor , and on entering the lobby , had It not been for the Chin se attendants and the throngs of smartly dressed people from all over the world , we might have thought ourselves in a New York , Paris or London hotel . - After we had dressed and dined , cars whisked us through the streets to a charity ball which we were told had been postponed in order that it might coincide with our arrival . It was held In the home of some merchant prince . But it was more of a palace than a mere house . " Upon entering we were asked to stand in front of some massive double doors for a moment . We were standing there innocently when suddenly they swung open , and we nearly dropped through the floor with fright Thera wo were facing a great throng of people in evening thesis Some one behind us gave a gentle shove to prevent us from running away . As We entered through an aisle the orchestra burst forth , and little girls in sweet little dresses walked in front of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We had never neon such a brilliant affair . The women wore stunning everang gowns , dazzling jewels , and diamond tiaras . The men were dressed In the uniforms of a dozen different nations . " Working Garb Causes Woe . Next day Smith and Arnold arrived , and again the reception committee , the foreign colony , and vast throngs of Chinese were out on the Yangtze Kiang to meet them . The second day the boys all worked on the planes until after dark , and when " Les " and Leigh returned to the hotel they had on their . greasy union-ails , The native footmen at the door of the Astor ordered them around to the tradesmen 's entrance . In the meantime Smith and Nelson were busy with naval officers figuring out the best way to " take off " from Shanghai and arranging for several destroyers to drop down the coast and prepare a special landing place where they could refuel , because they knew it , was going to be extremely difficult to get out of the Yangtze Kiang without hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of gas and oil . s Flyers Have Narrow Escape . Erik and Jack had an exceedingly narrow escape on the morning of May 7 , when attempting to " take off . " The traffic on the river was so great that the harbormaster had not been able to clear a very wide stretch . The first time the three planes attempted to get into the air they could n't make it , nearly collided with Chinese craft , turned and taxied buck , and then made a second attempt . The Chicago and Boston succeeded in getting off , but Erik and Jack went sailing up the Yangtze Kiang at sixty miles an hour , dodging sampans , freighters , ocean liners and junks . The other boys watched them with their hearts in their mouths fully expecting to see the New Orleans have a headon collision , but were , 1mmensely relieved to see her just clear the mast of a junk . Brave Rollers in Bay . With only enough gasoline to carry , them a short way down the China coast they flew ' from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tchimicoem bay . This body of water turned out to be not nearly as well protected from the open sea as it looked on the map . Huge rollers were coming in , but the pieties simply had to descend , because they were nearly out of fuel . Their take-off through the rollers was another one of those episodes of the trip when they did n't know whether they were going to make it or not . Experiences of this kind were almost an every day occurrence with thorn by now . ' On every flight they were ' always facing death , flying In all sorts of weather , never knowing just what the country was going to be like up ahead , and realizing that if anything went wrong and if the motor forced them to land immediately they were almost certain to crash .
