" no military or nailat base will be established there . We are reminded that its area is less than Rhode Island or Guam . and its harbor Emu II ; dually that it has no natural produce , and , " except for its cable facilities , is a worthless piece of barren soil In mlibocean .

None but the.Japanese government would slip the whole gist of an international . controversy into a modest except . Gibraltar is a small promontory without produce , and except for Its strategic position is a barren rock obtruding Itv unproductive bulk between the Atlantic and Mediterranean .

But small and barren as Yap is , it is important enough to call forth an assertion by the Japanese government that Japan will keep lt . The communique is , as we have said , an interest ? tog utterance throwing further light on the repeated claims of Japanese diplomacy to candor and straightforwardness . The whole Yap episode Is a sorry example of Wilson 's neglect of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage was takers of it .
