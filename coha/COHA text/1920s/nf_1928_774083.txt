txt // II . THE DRAFTING OF THE " STANDARD MARKETING ACT " In the prosecution of this work Mr. Sapiro became convinced that it was necessary to secure statutory provisions recognizing such contracts and authorizing vigorous measures for their enforcement . He therefore set about drafting such a measure as would , in his judgment , meet the needs of this situation . No action was taken at the time to have it adopted in the state of California , but when in 1919 its framer undertook the organization of the Oregon Growers ' Co-operative Association he was again impressed with the inadequacy of existing statutes to meet the needs of mdern co-operative organization . This resulted in substantial amendment to the Oregon law during the 1921 session of the legislature . Meanwhile , however , the organization of cotton associations in several of 11ie Southern states had been undertaken and , as an aid to such organization along lines considered necessary by Mr. Sapiro , a comprehensive measure drafted by him on the basis of his California and Oregon experience was presented first to the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of the other Southern stales . This measure was passed substantially in its original form by the states of Arkansas and Idaho in February , 1921 ; by Texas , Arizona , Kansas , Montana , North Carolina , North " COMMODITY MARKETING " io1 Dakota , and Washington in March , 1921 ; and by Georgia in August and Alabama in October of the same year . The year 1922 saw relatively few legis latures in session , but on January 10 of that year the so-called Bingham Act was passed by the legis lature of Kentucky . As this embodied several amendments which had grown out of earlier experi ence with the law , the Kentucky Act is ordinarily taken as the typical form of the Sapiro law , 4 and will be used as the basis of our subsequent discus sion . By the addition in 1923 ' of some fourteen states to the list of those adopting this law , and by smaller additions in 1924 and 1925 ( this including states that amended existing laws in substantial con formity with the new act ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ITnion have within a short period of time accepted legislation embodying the chief features that are to be considered character istics of this law . In view of the extensive vogue which this measure has enjoyed and of its present strongly entrenched position on our statute books , we should examine it with some care to see what are the distinctive ele ments which it has introduced or emphasized in our co-operative legislation . This measure departs from the brief and general terms in which earlier bills // were frequently drawn and which prevent subse quent students from determining the exact intent of the framers of those laws . Mr. Sapiro has inten tionally ( one may suppose ) adopted a didactic role and has included in his statute many phrases not strictly essential to its legal purpose , but designed to inform the Iaw-maker , the jurist , and the general public as to its meaning and purpose . Thus , for example , as a declaration of policy ( Section 1 ) we find the following : In order to promote , foster , and encourage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation ; and to eliminate speculation and waste ; and to make the distribution of agricultural prod ucts between producer and consumer as direct as can be efficiently done ; and to stabilize the marketing of agri cultural products , this act is passed . The author of the bill evidently was keenly con scious of the fact that such decisions as that in the Decorah Case ' ' tended lo enunciate a public policy for those states which might be cited elsewhere with harmful effect . I Ienee he felt it important that in the new act there should be a clear statement of the public policy of any state in which it might be passed . The same general intention is carried out iii still greater detail in Section 5 : Every group of persons contemplating the organization of an associat ion under this act is urged to communicate with the Dean of the College of Agriculture of the Uni versity of Kentucky , who will inform them whatever a // survey of the marketing conditions affecting the commodities proposed to be handled may indicate regarding probable success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production in contrast to the group or factory system that characterizes other forms of industrial production ; and that the ordinary form of corporate organization permits industrial groups to combine for the purpose of group production and the ensuing group marketing and that the public has an interest in permitting farmers to bring their industry to the high degree of efficiency and merchandising skill evidenced in the manufacturing industries ; and that the public interest urgently needs to prevent the migration from the farm to the city in order to keep up farm production and to preserve the agricultural supply of the nation ; and that the public interest demands that the farmer be encouraged to attain a superior and more direct system of marketing in the substitution of merchandising for the blind , unscientific and speculative selling of crops ; and that for this purpose , the farmers should secure special guidance and instructive data from the Dean of the College of Agriculture of the University of Kentucky . ' Much as Section 5 had sought to offset the effect of former court decisions , the last paragraph cited above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of adjudication // of this law on the ground that it was in effect class legislation . Hence this statement that there was a real distinction which the state desired to recognize as a matter of public policy , making it the basis of classification which presumably the courts would uphold as reasonable and proper . How fully this hope has been realized we shall see in Chapter XVI . This act differs from the Department bill discussed in the previous chapter in that it authorizes associations with capital stock as well as those without . It does , however , stress the idea of personal participating membership and the non-profit character of the organization . III . MEMBERSHIP QUALIFICATIONS AND VOTING POWERS As to membership , the chief provisions of the Bingham Co-operative Marketing Act are as follows : The term " member " shall include actual members of associations without , c ; ipitttl stock and holders of common stock in associations organized with capital stock . ( Section 2b ) No association . . . shall handle the agricultural products of any non-member except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions prescribed in the bylaws adopted by it , an association may admit as members , or issue conunou stock to , persons only engaged in the production of the agricultural products to be handled by or through the association , including the lessees and tenants of land used for the production of such products and any lessors and landlords who receive // as rent all or part of the crop raised on the leased prem ises . ( Section 7a ) Articles of Incorporation shall set forth : If organized without capital stock , whether the prop erty rights and interest of each member shall be equal or unequal ; and if unequal , the general rule or rules applicable to all members by which the property rights and interests , respectively , of each member may and shall be determined and fixed ; and provision for the admission of new members who shall be entitled to share in the property of the association with the old members , in accordance with such general rule or rules . ( Sec tion 8f ) 8 By-laws may provide : The amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the manner and method of collection of the same ; and the purposes for which they may be used . ( Section lOg ) The number and qualification of members or stock-holders of the association and the conditions precedent to membership or ownership of common stock ; the method , time and manner of permitting members to withdraw or the holders of common stock to transfer their stock ; the manner of assignment and transfer of the interest of members and of the shares of common stock ; the conditions , upon which and time when mem bership of any member shall cease ; the automatic sus-pension of the rights of a member when he ceases to be eligible to membership in the association ; and the mode , manner and effect of the expulsion of a member ; the manner of determining the value of a member 's interest and provision for its purchase by the association upon the death or withdrawal of a member or stockholder , or upon the expulsion of a member or forfeiture of his I06 AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION membership , or , at the option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed by conclusive appraisal by the board of directors . In case of the withdrawal or expul sion of a member , the board of directors shall equitably and conclusively appraise his property interests in the association and shall fix the amount thereof in money , which shall be paid to him within one year after such expulsion or withdrawal . ( Section l0i ) It will be observed that these membership re quirements are substantially identical with those of the Department bill iii that they limit member-ship to persons actively engaged in the production of the product dealt in by the association . The new act , however , is more strict in the limitation which it places upon dealing with non-members . It stipulates that the products of non-members shall be taken only for storage , " whereas the Department bill provided that the association , as agent for a non-member , might buy and sell for him and impose upon him any liability not in excess of the liability of the member , but in no case charge for such services more than their actual cost , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bingham Act lays down the one-ratan-one-vote rule , but provides that by-laws may prescribe " the right of members or stockholders to vote by proxy or by mail or both , // and the conditions , manner , form , and effects of such votes . " IV . DEFINITION OF " NON-PROFIT " While , this law does not insist on the non-stock form of organization , it does both provide for and attempt to define a non-profit plan of operation . It says : " Associations organized hereunder shall be deemed non-profit , ' inasmuch as they are not organ ized to make profit for themselves , as such , or for their members , as such , but only for their members as producers . " This is a point not specifically covered in the Department bill . However , the def inition here given is completely in harmony with expressions introduced in the Congressional debates on the Clayton Act , to which that law was supposed to conform . ' ? V. THE MEMBERSHIP CONTRACT AND ITS ENFORCEMENT In many quarters it is considered that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern the membership contract and its enforcement . As will be explained fully in a later chapter ( pp. 183ff ) , the member contract or equiva lent by-law provisions had long been in use , but were not given specific authorization either in laws of the Rochdale type or in the California laws of // 1895 and 1909 . The debates in Congress over the Clayton Act indicate that co-operative associations had never been under the ban of our anti-trust laws merely by reason of their form but that , on the other hand , such exemptions as were expressed in the Clayton Act were not such as to remove their actions from whatever penalties they might otherwise incur under the Sherman Act . " The Solicitor of the Department of Agriculture evidently felt that it had also been made clear that the signing of binding contracts by members did not in itself constitute restraint of trade , and therefore included in his draft bill clauses definitely authoriz-ing such procedures . Mr. Sapiro , however , went considerably further in this direction . lie believed that the contract revocable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fruit Growers ' Exchange ) was by no means adequate to meet , the sit uat ion . On this point his own view was expressed in the following words : It will be no fly-by-night stuff , no one-year contracts ; but five years or nothing . You have tried the other sys-tem for three or four generations , and you see where it left you , you see how independent you are today . ' = The contract should always be a long-term agreement . It is impossible for farmers in a period of less than three years to develop n trained personnel , to perfect the proc-ess of receiving the commodity , to make good and wise // commercial connections and to effect satisfactory bank ing arrangements . The rule is rather sound ? a short-term contract is hardly worth the paper it is written on . A long-term contract gives the farmer a chance . There should be no right of withdrawal whatsoever , except at the end of a specified long term . If the farmers intend to try the co-operative marketing system they should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis.13 They should not dabble with the subject as though it were some new nostrum or patent medicine . Therefore contracts range from three to fifteen years . Five years seems to be the fashion with the farmers of the country in the new organizations . ' The Department bill had provided that by-laws might require members to deal exclusively through the association and might fix liquidated damages in the case of the member 's failure to perform such obligations , provided the member might withdraw by giving notice to the association " during a , rea110 AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION sonable period of each year . " Section 17 of the Bingham Act differs sharply from the provisions of the Department bill not merely in the longer time for which the contract might be drawn , but by providing also clearly for the " sale and resale " type of contract , whereas the Department bill had contemplated only an agency relationship . The marketing contract section of the Bingham law reads as follows : The association and its members may make and execute marketing contracts , requiring the members to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , all or any specified part of their agricultural products or specified commodities exclusively to or through the association , or any facilities to be created by the association . If they contract a sale to the association , it shall be conclusively held that title to the products passes absolutely and unreservedly , except for recorded liens , to the association upon delivery ; or at any other specified time if expressly and definitely agreed in the said contract . The contract may provide that the association may sell or resell the products delivered by its members , with or without taking title thereto ; and pay over to its members , the resale price , after deducting all necessary selling , overhead and other costs and expenses , including interest on preferred stock , not exceeding eight ( 8 ) per cent per annum , and reserves for retiring the stock , if any ; and other proper reserves ; and interest not exceeding eight ( 8 ) per cent per annum upon common stock . ( Sec. 17 ) We have noted above that in the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liquidated damages as a means of enforcing the member 's obligation to deal with his association , // ending the section with the phrase : " Any such provision shall be valid and enforceable in the courts of this state . " The drafters of the " standard marketing act " evidently believed that it would be expedient not merely to have the legislators declare their minds on this matter for the future guidance of courts in case of litigation , but to authorize specifically certain remedies which associations might invoke in the event of a breach of their marketing contracts . This included not merely liquidated damages to be collected after the fact , but also injunction in the case of a threatened breach of the contract and specific performance thereof . Li view of complications growing out of the landlord-tenant situation in the Southern states it was desirable also to make the obligation binding upon the owner of the land . These provisions were embodied in Section 18 , which reads as follows : ( a ) The by-laws or the marketing contract may fix , as liquidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stockholder to the association upon breach by him of any provision of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of products ; and may further provide that the member will pay all costs , premiums for bonds , expenses and fees , in case any action is brought upon the contract by the association ; and any such provisions shall be valid and enforceable in the courts of this State ; and such clauses providing for liquidated damages shall be enforceable as such and shall not be regarded as penalties . ( b ) In the event of any such breach or threatened breach of such marketing contract by a member , the : ssociation shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent // the further breach of the contract and to a decree of specific performance thereof . Pending the adjudication of such an action and upon filing a verified complaint showing the breach or threatened breach , and upon filing a sufficient bond , the association shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the member . ( c ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusively presumed that a landowner or landlord or lessor is able to control the delivery of prod ucts produced on his land by tenants or others , whose tenancy or possession or work on such land or the terms of whose tenancy or possession or labor thereon were created or changed after execution by the landowner or landlord or lessor , of such a marketing agreement ; and in such actions , the foregoing remedies for non-delivery or breach shall lie and be enforceable against such landowner , landlord or lessor . ' Furthermore , experience had shown that outsiders personally interested in the handling of the several products frequently offer special inducements to members to sell to then ) instead of delivering to their own association . A third line of defense , there-fore , was proposed in two sections of the Bingham Act , aimed directly at persons outside the associa tion who might engage in activities designed to discourage the nleuther from living up to his mar keting cont ract . ' " These sections read as follows : // Sec. 26 . Any person or persons or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce any member or stockholder of an association organized hereunder to breach his marketing contract with the association , or who maliciously and knowingly spread false reports about the finances or management thereof , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine of not less than one hundred ( $100 ) dollars and not more than one thousand ( $1,000 ) dollars for each such offense ; and shall be liable to the association aggrieved in a civil suit in the penal sum of five hundred ( $500 ) dollars for each such offense . Sec. 27 . Any person , firm or corporation conducting a warehouse within the State of Kentucky who solicits or persuades or permits any member of any association organized hereunder to breach his marketing contract with the association by accepting or receiving such member 's products for sale or for auction or for display for sale , contrary to the terms of any marketing agreement of which said person or any member of the said firm or any active officer or manager of the said corporation has knowledge or notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit in the penal sum of $500.00 for each such offense ; and such association shall be entitled to an injunction against such warehouseman to prevent further breaches and a multiplicity of actions thereon . In addition , said warehouseman shall pay to the association a reasonable attorney 's fee and all costs involved in any such litigation or proceedings at law . This section is enacted in order to prevent a recurrence or outbreak of violence and to give marketing associations an adequate remedy in the courts against those who encourage violations of co-operative contracts . It will be observed that , while the " standard act " makes only minor changes in existing statutes so far as the handling of capitalization , voting , and the distribution of pecuniary benefits are concerned , 11I AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION it does depart from them very sharply in the greater degree of control that it attempts to set up over the commodity which the association is designed to handle and in restricting the rights of both members and outsiders with reference to it . These control features of the law naturally raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trade . Li the " standard act " it wrns thought wise to have the legislature declare itself specifically to the effect that associations organized under the act or contracts authorized in the act should not be deemed illegal or in restraint of trade . We shall not be in a position to consider this problem adequately until we examine further the conunercial procedures which have developed iii actual practice under laws of this sort . So far as it is possible to separate the two issues we have , up to the present point , been limiting our discussion to structure rather than function in order to see the form of organization which has been gradually coming to recognition in our enabling acts . In subsequent chapters we shall examine more fully the distinctive practices of cooperative associat ions and the views which have been taken concerning these practices by the courts when the process of litigation has brought them under judicial review . // VI . SUMMARY The attempt has been made in Chapters II , III , IV , and V to set forth those general features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided under our several laws to carry out the economic purposes of those who have sought to develop a new form of business organization corporate in form and yet differing from the ordinary profit-seeking enterprise . What has been accom plished in the way of distinctly co-operative structure may be conveniently summed up under three heads . ( 1 ) As to the handling of the capital stock problem , three different situations are to be recog nized : ( a ) the use of a single class of capital stock , non-transferable or with limited transferability , and so restricted as to voting power and/or size of holdings as to preclude concentration of control in the hands of a single individual or small group ; " // ( b ) the issuing of common stock of nominal value to active patron members of the association only , with equal suffrage for such members , and preferred stock sold both to members and outsiders for the purpose of raising capital , but carrying no voting right or a right so limited as to keep this creditor group in a minority position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation without capital stock , but with non-transferable voting member-ship for active participants in the business of the association , capital needs being met by the borrow ing of funds from the members on the basis of membership loan certificates and from members or others in the form of bonds , mortgages , bank credit , and other means of outside financing . ( 2 ) In the matter of costs , earnings , and profits , two types of association have developed : ( a ) those that buy from their members at a stipulated price , sell to such advantage as they can , and return any profit , to their members as a patronage dividend ; and ( b ) those which perform service for their members for a charge equal to direct and overhead cost . It // has already been pointed out that the first type of associations are not strictly non-profit and hence not , to the purist , truly co-operative . It is equally true , however , that associations of the second type find themselves confronted by serious practical difficulties in attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is comparatively easy to restrict by legal enactment or by-law provisions the rate of return allowed upon invested capital . It is distinctly more difficult to devise a form of organization under which members of the association shall neither benefit nor lose from transactions with nonmembers , or under which each member shall be able to identify and secure just the degree of benefit to which his individual portion of the business is entitled . Some of the problems thus raised will be examined further in the following chapter . ( 3 ) A distinct characteristic of all co-operative organizations is that they are based upon patron membership . Earlier laws frequently did not safeguard control in the hands of such members either by restricting the transferability of stock or by divesting it of voting power when the owner ceased to be an active patron of the association . Later laws show some trend , though not uniform and consistent , toward putting control and the sharing of benefits exclusively in the hands of patron members , that is , those actively participating in the business served by the association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit is merely the negative side of the membership feature of co-operation . On its positive side it involves active and consistent support of the association and use of its facilities by the members for whose mutual help it has been set up . On this positive side there has been a marked tendency to lay greater stress on the contractual obligation of the member to his co-operative organization . In fact , it would not be too much to say that under the latest laws the co-operative is conceived structurally as a mutual company made up of individuals carrying on a common line of production and merged into this joint agency by a definite contractual bond involving support of it with funds and patronage and the sharing pro rata in its benefits . This characterization of co-operative organization obviously raises the question of the degree of control over the business of its constituent members which is acquired by the co-operative . The nature of this control , the devices by which it is secured , and the manner in which it , is exercised will be discussed in some detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident , however , that the economic importance of whatever degree of control is acquired will depend quite largely on the possibilities for growth in size which is provided under the several types of co-operative laws . We have frequently referred to co-operation as a. means of effecting large-scale organization in agriculture . Three gen " COMMODITY // eral designs have been followed in the building of these more ambitious structures . We shall now glance back over the history of our co-operative law and practice to note the characteristics and differences of these three methods and also the possibility of blending them or utilizing still other procedures for securing the larger growths in the direction of either vertical or horizontal integration . CHAPTER VI FEDERATION , CENTRALIZATION , AND TREATY THE older period of co-operative organization in the United States was dominated by the local cooperative association organized generally in greater or less conformity with the Rochdale principles . The economic function which it performed was chiefly that of assembling and shipping products from a local station . In some cases , notably the co-operative creamery , the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly local lines has served a distinct purpose in achieving greater economy and efficiency in the assembling of suitable commercial lots for consignment , to central markets , there are two distinct needs for overhead organization which are likely io develop before co-operative organization can go far on 1 he road toward commercial effectiveness . The first of these is for an overhead service agency which shall assist on problems of organization and management ; furnish audits , legislative assistance , or insurance ; collect claims ; or perform like services which can be provided economically and efficiently only on a group basis . The second 120 // need is for organization of these smaller groups into some common agency either for market repre sentation , for collective bargaining as to price , or for actual selling and sales promotion in the central markets . ' Our chapter heading indicates that such over-head organizations have been built up under three general methods : ( a ) federation , ( b ) centralization , and ( c ) treaty . The first two of these terms have long been in use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps too violently ) from the usage of political science . The principle of federation is well worked out in the political system of the United States . A large degree of local self-government is left to school dis tricts , townships , counties , and municipalities at the same time that a desirable degree of uniformity within a larger district is secured through the suze rainty of each of the 48 almost " sovereign " states . Certain functions , however , in which national uni formity and centralized control are deemed to be important , such as currency , military defense , tariff restrictions , and the like , are entrusted to a central government agency created by the delegation of such // specifically enumerated powers by the 48 federated states . In contrast to this system , the French govern-ment is centralized , having a single national author-ity divided among administrative departments for reasons of convenience . These departements , how-ever , are not autonomous as are the states of the American Union . They in turn are divided into smaller districts , the arrondissements , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative sub-divisions . Finally , on matters of international concern sovereign nations , whether of the federated or centralized type , may join themselves together for united action in such enterprises as can be carried through only , or most advantageously , by joint action . Such affiliations are provided by special treaty . A good illustration of large-scale commer-cial operations carried on under international treaty is to be found in 11re International Postal Union . We have no desire to strain this analogy beyond its proper field of usefulness . But it may serve to indicate roughly the nature of these three methods for organizing large numbers or wide areas for joint action , and may shed some light on the problem of co-operative organization and government . I. FEDERATION OF LOCALS It is doubtful whether the word " federation " has ever acquired a fixed and definite usage in the vocabFEDERATION , // ulary of the co-operatives . Even where provisions calculated to make federation possible have been inserted in co-operative laws , the term itself has not been introduced , so far as the writer is aware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been taken for granted , however , that local co-opera tive associations would have the inherent right of joining themselves into such overhead associations as they might find convenient for the carrying on of their business . Even where locals were incorporated under general corporation laws or co-operative stat utes of the Wisconsin ( 1911 ) type the overhead organizations were frequently merely unincorpo rated associations of a very loose and informal type . Perhaps the most important illustration of rudi mentary federations is that of the state farmer grain dealer associations . Their formation began in 1903 and thus antedated the passage of co-opera tive laws in most , if not all , of the states where they were first established . They merely collected membership dues and service charges from such associations as saw fit to affiliate with them . Even down to the present there has been practically i 4 , AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION no delegation of authority from local associations to such overhead organizations covering the time or method of selling , routing of shipments or choice of market , insurance of property , auditing of accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter touching the actual conduct of their business . They do , however , represent a joining of local associations for concerted action on any matter in which they have a common concern , such as income tax legislation , the adjustment of freight rates , warehouse legislation , or the like . Where a group of these associations elect to procure accident and liability insurance through their state association they have in effect made it a joint buying agency , and there would seem to be no reason why they might not proceed in the same manner to delegate numerous other powers in connection with the technical management of local plants , the actual distribution of product , the gathering and dissemination of market information , and the collection of accounts . In practice they have frequently used the state association as a means of auditing freight bills and collecting overcharge or damage claims . In general , however , when local organizations of this type have undertaken either joint selling or joint buying operations , they have thought it best to organize a separate affiliated company , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in process of development , or the Farmers ' National Co-operative // Mutual Insurance Association , which has been in successful operation for some years . The fact that these latter enterprises represent business of an interstate character is probably a partial explanation of their independent organization . However , the same practice has generally been followed where state elevator groups have undertaken the joint buying of supplies , such as coal , fertilizer , twine , and the like . In a word , then , the federation principle properly speaking ? that is , the actual delegation of powers by local associations to a state or other overhead organization ? has proceeded but feebly in most parts of our co-operative movement . A number of organizations have been set up for the performance of particular commercial functions for such local bodies as might care to avail themselves of these services on a mere fee basis , the locals being free to purchase this service without any specific authorization in the law . The self-governing character of the local associations has been preserved to a high , possibly even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slowly and cautiously toward the delegation of any of their powers , it is not strange that legislation has failed to set forth clearly any plan by which local , regional , and central organizations might definitely set up a comprehensive integrated structure for handling the given line of business . Legislative expression on federation apparently // began with the Wisconsin law of 1887 . It provided that " members of any such association , or the association itself , may own shares in any similar association . . . provided that the association , as such , may own as much as one-third of the capital stock of any similar association ; but no association shall have more than one vote in the management of the affairs of any other association in which it may be a shareholder . " In 1905 a clause was introduced into the co-operative statute of Minnesota , permitting associations to " buy and hold stock in other corporations organized for the same general purpose . " 3 Examination shows that problems were arising in the business of the co-operative associations which called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of associations for joint action by local bodies . The Minnesota law of 1907 was a direct outgrowth of the belief that , if the elevators and warehouses being established under the auspices of the American Society of Equity were to achieve the purposes for which they were designed , they must have district and state organizations or " exchanges " a which would enable them to concentrate both buying and selling opera'General Laws of Minnesota , 1905 , Chapter 276 . By contrast , the extremely local character of some of the earlier development is shown in the fact that the co-operative creamery law of 1597 ( see Chapter II , p. 44 ) not merely limited capitalization to a maximum of $25,000 , but also provided that all the incorporators must be " residents of the county in which the corporation . . . has its plant . " // tions in such a way as to secure direct price advantages.5 This purpose of the Minnesota law of 1907 to create larger collective bargaining units of the federated type is shown also in the general purpose clause , providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of selling and otherwise disposing of any product of any man ufacturing or agricultural co-operative association organized under the provisions of Section 3073 , Revised Laws , 1905 , or Chapter 276 or 313 , General Laws , 1905 , and any amendments thereto . " Such an association was " hereby authorized , in addition to those other powers to it granted , upon an affirma tive vote of a majority of its stockholders , had at any regularly called annual or special meeting , to subscribe , through its officers , to the capital stock or any stock of any corporation organized under the provisions of this act , pay for the same and thereafter , in like manner , vote the same and exer cise all the usual powers of a stockholder in a corporation , subject to the limitations herein before set forth . " The Wisconsin law of 1911 elaborated the federa128 AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION tion principle in three sections . They conferred the same general power as that given in the earlier Minnesota laws , but modified in detail and so ex panded as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out . These provi sions came onto the statute books of a considerable number of states as a result of widespread copying of the Wisconsin law , although it does not appear that much practical use was made of them . " It may be noted too that the Texas Co-operative Societies Act of 1917 , after stressing the " purely local character " of these associations , added : Provided that corporations ' incorporated hereunder may join with other corporations incorporated under this Act in establishing and maintaining joint agencies for the accomplishment of the purposes for which they are incorporated . No definite provisions for the organization or reg ulation of such federations were made , however , and it appears that no advantage was taken of this gen eral permissive clause . The organization which is best known as a fully worked out scheme of large-scale federated type is the California Fruit Growers ' Exchange . This sys tem is based upon local packing houses , many of // which organized for burness and carried on the packing and shipment of their fruit before the devel opment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has gone on , the locals have become concerned purely with the harvesting , grading , and packing of the product , delegating marketing func tions to an overhead organization which could handle it more economically and effectively . ' This has given rise to a number of district exchanges ( now 22 ) which have nothing to do with the physical handling of the fruit , but which do undertake to study the markets and administer the distribution of shipments . These district exchanges in turn have found it expedient still further to centralize control of certain functions . They have accordingly fed erated themselves into a state exchange , which maintains a common selling agency in Eastern markets , attends to collections and the remitting of funds , controls a common trade-mark , conducts ad vertising and sales promotion work , and gathers // market . information which it transmits to the various district exchanges . These overhead services are rendered at cost , which is pro-rated to the local packing associations and thus charged back upon each unit of fruit handled . The working out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitated by the fact that both underlying and overhead organizations were all located within a single state . An interesting case of the opposite situation is found in the American Cranberry Exchange , which is a selling agency for three state organizations , which are themselves in turn federations of local co-operatives . The American Cranberry Exchange is a non-stock corporation , chartered under 1he laws of the state of Delaware , its memberAip being limited to growers of cranberries and officials of cranberry growers ' associations . ' These niennbers each pay a membership fee and are cut i t led to one vote each in the government of t h e central exchange . They are members also of their respective state companies , and the structure of the lot t er may be explained by a quotation describing llre New England Cranberry Sales Company , the largest of the three state units . The New England Cranberry Sales Company was incorporated originally in Massachusetts in 1907 and reincorporated in the same state in 1919 . It is a non stock and non-profit growers ' co-operative organization . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , // firms , associations , or corporations engaged in the busi ness of growing , packing , or shipping cranberries or their by-products . " To become a member , a written applica tion must be made to the board of directors and must be approved by two-thirds of the directors present and voting . A membership fee of $20 is collected , half of which goes to the state association and half to the central or ganization . The dues are $1 a year . Each member is entitled to one vote . The state associations do not have specific membership contracts . However , " each member , until lie ceases to be such , agrees to deliver and ship his entire cranberry crop under the rules and regulations of the company . " In most cases it is recommended that members be required to sign contracts in addition to signing the by-laws . . . . The companies have no capital stock . The state com panies are allotted 2 per cent , deducted from sales f.o.b. shipping point , to cover operating expenses , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachu setts a reserve fund is maintained which consists of the unexpended balance of the 2 per cent allotment together with the company 's share of the unexpended balance of the 5 per cent allotment to the central association . These unexpended balances are kept in the hands of the com pany for one or more years before they are returned to the growers in the form of sales expense refund . A small reserve of from $1,000 to $5,000 is maintained by the Wisconsin company on the same basis . In New Jersey a revolving fund is maintained by means of loans from members.8 // The precise manner in which functions will be distributed and powers delegated in any given case is , of course , a matter of practical expediency and local experimentation . However , since the method of building up large-scale business organizations through the federation of local co-operatives has been a new development iii American commercial practice and commercial law , it has been found desirable to have itt the co-operative law at least a. general statement indicating that such practices are eontetnplaled and have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pur-chase of stock in other associations such as was developed in 11te early Minnesota and Wisconsin laws is not only incomplete as a statement of such policy Litt unsuited to the purposes of non-stock associations . This difficulty was met in the Cali-fornia law of 11 ) Ot ) by the insertion of the following clause : 653q . Each association incorporated under this title shall have the povvcrs granted by the provisions of this code and other laws of California relating to pri-vate corporations , and shall also have the following powers : . . . // 3 . Upon the written assent or by a vote of members representing two thirds of the total votes of all members to co-operate with any other co-operative corporation or corporations for the co-operative and more economical carrying on of their respective businesses , by consolida tion as provided in section 653i of this code , ' whereupon the effect of such consolidation shall be the same as de clared in said section ; or upon resolution , adopted by its board of directors , to enter into all necessary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proper stipulations and arrangements with any other co-operative corporation or corporations for t he co-opera tive and more economical carrying on of its business , or any part or parts thereof ; or any two or more co-opera tive corporations organized under this title , upon resolu tions , adopted by their respective board of directors , may , for the purpose of more economically carrying on their respective businesses , by agreement between them unite in employing and using , or several associations may sepa rately employ and use , the same methods , means and agencies , for carrying on and conducting their respective businesses . It will bo noted that this California law ( besides direct consolidation ) 10 suggests two types // of inter-relation : first , that by specific contract or agreement , to which we shall presently refer under our " treaty " heading , and , second , the federated type of overhead agency . The statement with reference to the last is couched in the most general terms , leaving to by-law provisions or the subsequent operations of such a central agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Obviously in a non-stock association , control can not , be exercised by the voting of stock by the underlying organizations . In practice the California Erriit ( ; rowers ' Exchange has handled the matter by giving one vote to the delegate of each member association , but providing also for a " Board of Representatives " to which controversial questions may be referred and in which voting is proportionate to the volume of business contributed to the Exchange . When we conic to the Department bill , we find it providing ( Section 6j ) that associations shall have power " to co-operate , through membership or otherwise , with any other association not conducted for profit , whet her formed under this act , or otherwise , for the purpose of promoting any enterprise , which may be InNfully carried on , relating to the respective authorized operations of such associations , and which enterprise does not relate to or involve fixing wages , limiting production , destroying products , or fixing the selling price , or delegating the control , of the products of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter part of this clause will be reserved for subsequent chapters when we come to discuss the whole restraint of trade issue . The point here is that the Department bill specifically authorized inter-association organization " through membership or otherwise . " Under our basis of class ification only the former of these arrangements would be regarded as federal in character , others coining under the " treaty " heading to which we shall shortly refer . This would imply that in fed erations , properly speaking , the rule of equal voting would have to be observed , since Section 9 of the Department bill begins : " Each member shall be entitled to one vote only . " This , it will be remem bered , is the rule explicitly stated in the Iowa law of 1921 ( see footnote page 123 ) and in the Wis cousin law of 1887 ( see page 42 ) . In a word , then , co-operative federations are asso ciations of associations . " They permit of integra tion of an agricultural industry horizontally by bringing together many local units of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the addition of functions , ordinarily those of central market or export selling , demand promotion , and packing or processing . In common usage the term frequently is made to include also what we have reserved for separate treatment in the third division of this chapter , namely , " treaty " arrangements . // II . CENTRALIZED MARKETING CO-OPERATIVES Laws of the Kentucky type , on the one hand , and those of the Wisconsin ( 1911 ) and California ( 1909 ) types , on the other , proceed from quite diver-gent philosophies of co-operative organization . The latter favor what is sometimes called a democratic is system , owing to the fact that complete control of the whole marketing process is conceived to reside originally in the local association , district and cen tral units deriving their powers only through the delegation of specific authority by the locals . The Kentucky type of law , on the other hand , favors centralization and direct control . Nevertheless it would be difficult indeed for anyone who sought to gain an understanding of the various phases of co-operative organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate clue to these differences . The pertinent provisions of the Kentucky Co-operative Marketing Act are as follows : Sec. 6 . Each association incorporated under this act shall have the following powers : ( d ) To purchase or otherwise acquire ; and to hold , own , and exercise all rights of ownership in ; and to sell , transfer or pledge , or guarantee the payment of diviFEDERATION , // dends or interest on , or the retirement or redemption of , shares of the capital stock or bonds of any corporation or association engaged in any related activity or in the warehousing or handling or marketing of any of the products handled by the association . Sec. 7 . If a member of a non-stock association be other than a natural person , such member may be represented by any individual , associate , officer or manager or mem ber thereof , duly authorized in writing . One association organized hereunder may become a member or stockholder of any other association or associations organized hereunder . There is no marked dissimilarity between these provisions and others cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federation of locals into large overhead organizations . It was just as possible for the raisin growers to form a centralized association under the California law as it was for the citrus growers to build up a fed erated system . Likewise it would be quite as possible for farmers ' elevators in Illinois to develop a comprehensive grain marketing scheme under a law of the ' Pent ucky type . There would simply be a difference of procedure . We have indicated sufficiently how local mar keting groups might be organized with all the marketing functions in their own hands , how they might decide which of these ( chiefly physical hand-ling ) they could perform effectively through a local organization , and thereafter delegate those which need to be handled on a group basis to such district // and central federations as seem to be called for . In the case of a centralized association , retention of control over distribution and pricedetermining policies is the function which is regarded as paramount . Incidental to this there arise various questions as to how the actual assembling , storing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effectively performed . Under the general principle of division of labor it will commonly be found desirable to delegate such functions to subsidiary organizations , which may or may not be local in their character . In the case of tobacco and milk it is highly important that such plants be so centralized and so distributed geographically as to get maximum efficiency for the group regardless of individual convenience or local preference . In such cases it may be desirable to have a warehousing or processing corporation co-extensive with the marketiug company . This has seemed clearly to be the case Nvith raisins and largely so with fluid milk . In the case of cotton we have an interesting situation much more analogous to that of the farmers ' elevator or co-operative creamery territory . The local gin does in fact perform important local functions and becomes a convenient agency , therefore , for some form of local organization with active interest and participation of its own . but with some close-knit affiliation to the central organization . It is comparatively easy to see how cotton organizations might have proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had developed early in somewhat the same manner as the farmers ' elevator or co-operative creamery movement . The problem is now being faced by the Texas Farm Bureau Cotton Association of developing these local units not alone for the direct advantage that members will receive through ginning on a co-opera tive basis , but also for the greater strengthening of the central organization through the stimulation of local interest and participation.13 Apparently in // such cases we shall arrive at a system of dual membership in which the individual grower would join both the local gin association and the central cotton marketing association . Reverting again to our political analogy , this situation would not be essentially different from that prevalent in the United States where one has both state and Federal citizenship . In terms of the distribution of authority , however , two rather distinct systems may develop . It will be observed that in the Texas cotton situation it is expected that the central selling agency will serve as a promotional agency with reference to the location and organizat ion of local gin associations , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some control over their subsequent operations . This would create a. situation about half-way between the two possible extremes . On the one hand would be the centralized association retaining complete control of local processing plants , locating them where it saw fit , and controlling their operation as a part of the centralized marketing machinery . At the other extreme would be the central association having direct rneinbership relations with producers who , however , also own a local assembling or processing plaid formerly quite independent in its operations , but now tied to the central association by some sort of contract to handle product through it alone , or at least send it all the product of producers in its territory who hold membership in the // central . The first situation can be seen in the experience of some of the Canadian wheat marketing organizations , and in this country was illustrated by the Equity Exchange , whose experience , however , failed to demonstrate the desirability of this method . The second situation is illustrated by several wheat pools which have utilized local farmers ' elevators for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is on a purely contractual basis , it falls properly under the next heading of our present chapter . Before going on to discuss such " treaty " arrangements , a word should be said of the method by which members exercise control in the centralized type of association . In such organizations there may be as many as 50,000 , 75,000 , or even 100,000 members . They may be scattered over several states and never have seen the offices , officials , or physical plant of the association . It is not possible to secure the attendance of any large proportion of them at the annual meeting of the association or at specially called meetings . If they are to have any intelligent views as to how the business of the association should be conducted and to express themselves in any effective way in what is supposed to be a democratic type of organization , it is necessary that some form of local groups shall be set up and direct voting for locally representative directors be provided . The first point has not been covered specifically // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized county or other local associations for the cultivation of interest in and understanding of the work of the association . They afford a ( meeting place where its affairs may be discussed , informa-tion transmitted from headquarters , and the grie-vances or suggestions of members crystallized and transmitted to the central office . These or other suitable units are also utilized for the election of directors . The method of district voting was first outlined in laws of the Kentucky type . Here it is provided : The affairs of the association shall be managed by a board of not Icss than five directors , elected by the mem-bers or stockholders from their own number . The by-laws may provide that the territory in which the asso-ciation hats members shall be divided into districts and that the directors shall be elected according to such districts , either directly or by district delegates elected by the members in that district . In such a case the by-laws shall specify the number of directors to be elected by each district , the manner and method of reapportion-ing the directors and of redistricting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide that primary elections shall be held in each district to elect the directors ; apportioned to such districts and that the result of , all such primary elections may be ratified by the next regular meeting of the association or may be considered final as to the association . " // It has sometimes been assumed that the cen tralized type of large-scale co-operative is the only form of organization capable of achieving the purposes of modern " commodity marketing . " This is by no means true . As large and as efficient a group may be built up under the federated form . Both types of organization have their particular field of usefulness , and this depends in the last analysis on the nature of the product to be handled . This is strikingly illustrated by the fact that the wool growers of the fleece wool states ? the heart of the old Rochdale territory ? spontaneously devel oped centralized associations , finding this the only practical means of organizing for the handling of their commodity . Wherever a local assembling , storage , loading , or processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled or the organization of the trade through which it is distributed , there is a good opportunity for identifying both the moral and fi nancial interest of the community with a tangible and actively functioning unit of the system . In other cases , however , storage and processing must be handled at central points if the work is to be done efficiently and economically , and in all cases control of actual distribution must be centralized // to a considerable degree if any comprehensive and effective plan is to be carried out . Tobacco and fluid milk appear to be two out-standing cases in which centralized organization is indicated . With them , centralized bargaining , hand-ling , and financing functions are highly important and local plant and function practically negligible . In such cases , therefore , organization naturally pro-ceeds in the direction of a strong centralized marketing agency with which the individual grower has direct membership relations . ' ' As for others , we shall probably find that , given certain peculiar cir-cumstances of time , place , and personal leadership , it is about equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherent and compre-hensive marketing system or backward from an ambitious centralized beginning to effective and complete organization of the whole industry through the addition of local participating units . So far as the law is concerned , practically the only points which need mentioning even are those covering the election of directors by districts , and in stock associations the ownership by the central association of stock in local subordinate organiza-tions . We have observed the manner in which these provisions have heed incorporated in the statutes of our several states . // III . TREATY ARRANGEMENTS OF CO-OPERATIVES Parts I and II of this chapter have dealt with the more formal and permanent structural arrangements by which co-operatives achieve large-scale organization . We have intimated at several points in the discussion that the co-operative organization of the several branches of agricultural industry may proceed also by the linking up of shipping units , processing plants , warehouses , finance organizations , selling agencies , and the like in more flexible relationships with a less complete or permanent bond between them . It has seemed to the writer that such inter-association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements entered into by independent political jurisdictions . They are simply the special agreements by which co-operatives work together while at the same time they retain a desirable degree of freedom in operating their several individual associations . We have called it a federation when a group of farmers ' elevators " join " a state association which they maintain permanently as a common overhead agency for auditing , claim adjusting , legislative service , or whatever . The same result , however , may be accomplished by mere agreement between individual locals and some service agency connected with an entirely different type of organization . For example , livestock shipping associations may secure auditing and business analysis service from a de146 AGRICULTURAL ( ' O-OPERATION partment of their state Farm Bureau Federation set up expressly for the purpose of rendering high class service at minimum cost by serving all types of local co-operatives within the state . In a similar way it is possible for poultry and egg shipping associations to make agreements with creameries for warehousing and shipping the product of their members , or to contract with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling their eggs on a distant market . This would get them high class market representation and at the same time obviate establishment of a selling organization of their own . In fact , the complete co-operative system of a region is likely to present a combination of all three methods . Local stripping associations may be federated into a state service agency , may sell all or part of their product through a centralized marketing pool , and may secure warehousing , financing , or other service through a warehouse , finance , or other corporation organized as a subsidiary of one of the overhead associations , entirely independent , or affiliated with a general farmers ' organization . Through such devices it has become possible in theory , and is gradually being worked out in practice , that the commercial producers of an agricultural region may organize the distributive end of their business ( including necessary auxiliary functions ) on a basis not less comprehensive or efficient than that which is achieved by corporate industry in the non-agriFEDERATION , // cultural field.t " Where such a large-scale under-taking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the growers in a specialized producing region . or even conceivably co-extensive with the particular branch of agricul ture , it verges upon " commodity control . " Control of the commodity is indeed one kind of efficiency in the securing of satisfactory prices . It has been visualized as one of the objectives of co-operative organization , and on the other hand has become an object of attack on the part of those who feared that co-operation as an agency for " big business " methods in agriculture was destined to lead to food monopoly and restraints upon agricul tural trade . An examination of this issue will be a prominent feature of the remaining chapters of this book . In order to appreciate just what are the trends and potentialities in this direction , we must understand thoroughly not merely the structural details of co-operation , which have been discussed // somewhat fully already , but must supplement this by an analysis of the practices characteristic of modern types of co-operation . Whatever degree of power in the market-place and influence over the price-making process co-operatives may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which grows out of pooling provisions and of the control of product delegated under membership arrangements . The three chapters which follow will therefore examine the origin , growth , and present standing of these distinctive co-operative procedures . CHAPTER VII SEVERAL VARIETIES OF CO-OPERATIVE POOL WE turn now from a consideration of the distinctive forms which . co-operative organizations take to an examination of the characteristic methods used by co-operatives in conducting their commercial enterprises . Co-operation means joint operation , the " mutual " handling of the business of many individuals acting as a group . It means the pooling of common interests . But the word " pool , " though used freely among co-operatives , is used very loosely and with little discrimination of several rather diverse practices which it is from time to time made to cover . In view of this confusing usage and since , furthermore , the word has acquired a somewhat discreditable meaning in the eyes of the law and in public opinion , we need to examine both the form and the purpose of pooling or joint operation methods from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of co-operative business . We shall discuss them under three heads : ( 1 ) The Expense Pool ; ( 2 ) The Settlement Pool ; and ( 3 ) The Market Adjustment or Manipulative Pool . 149 // I. THE EXPENSE POOL Co-operative business inevitably drifts into some type of pooling operations . The simplest of these may be nothing more than what is known in the ordinary commercial concern as " allocation of overhead . " In other regards , however , they display pecularities distinctly their own . In preceding chapters we have skated over thin ice by describing co-operative business as " service at cost . " This sort of generalization is all very well as covering the limitation of capital returns to going interest rates and the elimination of profits either to members or outsiders . However , " costs , " while apparently a simple and easily understandable term in its common abstract usage , proves to be a very elusive quantity when its actual determination is sought in the practical routine of commercial operations . If it were possible for each individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operative business , it would be relatively easy , even though certain overhead expenses would have to be allocated under some more or less arbitrary rule . Obviously , however , the whole nature of co-operative business implies that individual parcels will not be separately handled , but that large volumes of product will be lumped together either for economy in handling or for greater effectiveness in bargaining for their sale . This leads to loss of identity of more and more of these service costs and to the // more - thoroughgoing types of " expense pools . " Let us begin our discussion of this phase of pooling procedure with a simple type of co-operative business in which the member 's belief and desire are expressed in the simple formula , " getting just what his product brings in the market less actual cost of getting it there . " The livestock shipping association was at the start able to carry out such a theory with a close approach to accuracy . Animals were marked before shipment and sold according to this identification mark . They were then charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yardage , freight , and home manager 's expense . Any " shrink " in weight at the time of delivery as compared with weight at the local shipping point would be deducted pro rata on the theory that all had lost weight in the same proportion . This slight conventionalizing of . charges , however , had to pass over to more open and conscious pooling in the case of losses due to deaths in transit or at the stockyards . Inasmuch as such a loss can be identified as falling actually upon the property of some individual shipper , the distribution pro rata over the whole load represents a clear departure from the practice of paying each man just what his stock actually brought . It is a very simple form of pooling , dictated by the obvious fact that the risk of such loss is common to all animals in the load . Not only losses of weight , crippling , and death , but also the individual consumption of feed or // demands upon the time and attention of the mana ger and his helper , raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given member 's shipment and of the proper allocation of responsibility for these costs . In practice it has been found expedient , if not necessary , to assume that all units handled in a given shipment are equally responsible for , and equally the beneficiaries of , the total expense in curred in handling that shipment . Thus even in livestock shipping associations the expense comes to be pooled for all individual lots making up a shipment 2 or constituting a particular class of stock in a shipment . In the case of most commodities , moreover , the time of delivery and methods of storage , processing , and making up shipments do not permit of the cutting off of expense by separate parcels so clearly as in the case of livestock . ITence it . becomes nec essary to put more and more items of this sort from the direct to the overhead class , to pool handling expense over longer periods of time , and to deduct uniform handling charges from products coming from many different shipping points . To an extent , such freight charges have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone rates . In many others , however , even where a known difference exists , the cost involved in trying to reflect such differences in individual expense charges is found to be disproportionate to the benefit received by some or the loss incurred by others under a system of uniform charges by which all or certain classes of expense are pooled and distributed at a flat rate , possibly even to every unit of a product handled throughout a whole year . The expense pool presents practically an accounting problem similar to that met by any business of considerable size and has , in so far as the writer is aware , raised no distinct legal issues . It is discussed here primarily for the purpose of giving continuity to our discussion of the whole process by which co-operative practice evolves from the simplest to the more complex situations which have raised legal difficulties . H. THE SETTLEMENT POOL We have pointed out that the desire of the cooperative " to get just what his product brings less actual cost of handling " is confronted by the difficulty of identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a product which must be funded for purposes of economical and efficient handling . A little examination of the matter shows also that it is not less difficult , under such circumstances , to ascertain just what part // of the total receipts of a co-operative is properly to be credited to an individual member or to a particular parcel of goods handled . We shall take a rather simple type of fruit or vegetable shipping association for purposes of illustration . Let us say that 100 farmers are delivering potatoes to a potato shipping association . To take the most simple possible condition , we will assume that today each of five producers delivers enough potatoes just to fill a single car , and that these five cars are this evening sent to market . It may be that . the local manager has what he considers satisfactory bids for five cars and sells them all f.o.b. the local station , but , gets for one or two of them a premium of a few cents a. bushel over the price paid for the others . Immediately there arises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . Or it may be that one or two cars can be sold on track at the local station and the others consigned to a terminal market . Or perhaps all of them command different prices , even though uniform in quality and sold in the same market . Still further , it might be possible that all five cars were consigned to different markets , in which they finally yielded perhaps widely different net . prices to the shippers . To attempt to give the producer just what his product brought , when the choice of market to which it was sent or the particular buyer to whom it was sold was subject to the absolute decision of the local manager or the yet more arbitrary decision of pure chance , // would promptly engender such dissatisfaction as to break up the association . The matter , however , is still further complicated by the fact that farmers deliver their potatoes in ungraded lots , whereas the market wants uniform cars ; that for economical grading , storing , and loading , it is impracticable to attempt to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the market , the physical handling capacity of the warehouse , the ability to get cars , and the like may require the holding of some of the product for sale in later markets , sometimes at higher and sometimes at lower prices than those obtaining at the time of delivery . As a result , any but the very simplest co-operative selling operations preclude the identification of producers ' lots clear through to the time when they are sold in the market , and necessitate some type of funding or pooling of proceeds as well as expense . Qualitative differences can , of course , be recognized under a system of grading , but time differences must be adjusted upon some basis related to the character of the product and necessary trade practices . Thus , for example , perishable fruits , which are shipped immediately upon delivery , and in whose market price changes are likely to be abrupt from day to day , are frequently handled on the basis of a oneclay pool . Potatoes are in many ways suited to a weekly pool , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vogue . In the // case of oranges , pools of a month or six weeks in length at the beginning and close of the season , with a longer pool to cover the main crop , have seemed to give satisfaction . With more staple commodities , such as wheat , cotton , and tobacco , the all-season pool has much to recommend it . In all that is here said , however , we must remember that we are considering pooling primarily as a method of settling for the product . Assuming that the time and place of marketing are determined by weather , perishability , transportation conditions , and similar factors entirely outside the co-operative association 's hands , we note that it is to an extent impossible from the handling and accounting standpoint , but also inequitable from the economic standpoint , to attempt to earmark each grower 's product and return the proceeds of this identical parcel to him . As in the case of the expense pool , we are dealing here with internal problems of the best possible management for the association and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction for such methods is hardly involved . However , this aspect of pooling shades off almost insensibly into a third class in which such legal issues are sharply raised . III . THE MARKET-ADJWSTMENT OR MANIPULATIVE POOL From the ( lays of the Rochdale pioneers downward it has been pointed out that the competition of // a large number of small buyers or sellers with each other has been harmful to their best interests . The purpose of co-operation has been to supersede this destructive competition by some form of joint action which would be mutually beneficial . In nonagricultural fields large industrial consolidations have aimed to attain a size sufficient to assume the determination and handling of policies and operations of the steel industry , oil , meat-packing , electric equipment , or whatever , on a basis as broad as the industry itself . Similarly , farmers have desired to have a business agency competent to administer the affairs of the citrus fruit industry of California , the fluid milk industry of the New England states , the tobacco industry of the Burley district , the soft wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a group of Southern states , in economic units commensurate with the organization of the market in which their product is sold and the character and geographic distribution of the productive system by which it is produced . Pools covering a wide geographical range and long time periods are characteristic of the " commodity marketing " movement . ' Pooling for local stations or small districts had been going on for many years before the new co-operative influence attracted attention . Likewise some organizations , and notably the California Fruit Growers ' Exchange , had developed a system of pooling covering a period as long as several months or even the full season // on certain varieties of their product . This , however , was primarily a settlement pool , and involved little or no intention of putting the whole product in the hands of a central distributive agency to be administered in point of time in such a way as to produce the best price results . The semi-perishable character of the product precluded any great results in this direction , but with the development of centralized types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beans , dried fruits , cotton , wheat , and tobacco , the idea of putting the whole season 's supply under a single administrative control for the sake of securing better price results by a program of collective marketing gained considerable vogue . The first formal expression of this type of pooling theory appears to be traceable to the influence of the American Society of Equity following 1902 . Through it the philosophy that market control by manufacturers or dealers must be combated by strongly organized control of supplies on the part of producers gained a foothold in several parts of the Middle Vest . We have already noted that this led to the adoption in Minnesota in 1907 of amendments to the co-operative law , designed to permit joint selling by the producers of any commodity joined in an organization which might be state-wide in its scope and he made up by the federation of existing local marketing associations . The emphasis in this law was upon the structure of overhead // marketing agencies , with only incidental reference to the collective selling practices thereby involved . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of co-operative law . Another prominent center of Equity activity was in the tobacco regions of Kentucky , and there too the pooling idea was taken up so vigorously as to result in its recognition in the law of the state . Kentucky had never developed local co-operative agencies to the extent which Minnesota had , nor had the legislature passed statutes providing for the organization of co-operative marketing associations . What was undertaken in 1906 was a holding move ment designed to resist the depression of tobacco prices as a result of the concentration of demand in the hands of a small number of buyers practically dominated by a single " trust . " 3 Such marketing activities in the way of assembling , storing , and selling as were to be undertaken were purely inci dental to this primary purpose , of controlling supplies in such a way as to attain a certain price objective . The Kentucky law therefore was not an enabling act providing for the organization and operation of a co-operative marketing machinery , but was a statute defining certain practices as being valid and legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1906 read as follows : // Section 1 . It is hereby declared lawful for any num ber of persons to combine , unite , or pool , any or all of the crops of wheat , tobacco , corn , oats , hay , or other farm products raised by them , for the purpose of classifying , grading , storing , holding , selling , or disposing of same , either in parcels or as a whole , in order or for the pur pose of obtaining a greater or higher price therefor than they might or could obtain or receive by selling said crops separately or individually . Section 2 .

Although the tobacco pooling movement , after rather spectacular nut temporary success , depending in considerable part on violence and " night riding , " // practically disappeared in 1909 , the general philoso phy of collective bargaining was not entirely given up . In many sections of the country it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " commodity marketing " movement of the post-war period came forward to furnish it with an aggressive leadership . IV . MARKET ADJUSTMENT AS A GOAL OF " COMMODITY MARKETING " The objectives and methods of the recent wave of pool marketing can conveniently be set forth by quoting directly from its most vigorous exponent . ' Co-operative marketing as such is concerned with one thing , and that is to do intelligent merchandising instead of dumping of a farm product . . . With all the farmer 's 1 intelligence in production , when it comes to actual selling or marketing of that product , he finds him-self fairly helpless to have anything to say about the price of that product . And the old school says to him , " Supply and demand fixes that price , and you ca n't have anything to do with it . " And the new school says to the farmer , " Supply and demand does not fix the price . There are two movable things in supply and demand , and those movable factors are supply where , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which fix price value within supply and demand of any given product . " . . . Now co-operative marketing sets out to control the flow of supply . as to time , place , and quantity , and in order to do that it has to stop individual selling . That is the one big thing we have really learned in the last few years , that the aim of co-operative marketing is to // merchandise in that way instead of dumping in the old method of individual selling . . . The farmer , as a merchandiser , must meet his group problem as a group . Marketing is always a group problem . You can not market a single thing under the sun intelligently unless you know first what the other man is producing at that time , what he is moving into the market into which you want to sell , and what the absorbing power of all those markets might be . These things depend on the other fellow ; therefore they are group problems , and can not be solved by the individual farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method or quantity of production or sales . So the big thing we have found in co-operative marketing is , first , to clear up the purpose . Co-operative marketing is a system under which farmers , by proper organization , can learn to merchandise a commodity and control the flow of the supply as to time , place and quantity , and thereby have something to do with affecting the price value on that product . Co-operative marketing is not the making of cheese in a co-operative cheese factory . Co-operative marketing is a step which follows co-operative manufacturing . It is a step which follows co-operative packing or co-operative receiving , and it is not co-operative marketing unless the aim is distinctly the stopping of individual selling and dumping , and the substitution of merchandising , control of flow and supply , as to time and place and quantity . This exposition , together with our own analysis of the market-ad , justmcnt type of pooling , must make it clear that there are likely to develop here two discernibly different situations as to price-making activity . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its product to a central administrative agency , such an agency naturally attempts to effect an intelVARIETIES // ligent distribution of the whole product entrusted to its care . By building up a large-scale organization it can employ more expert servants , collect fuller information , and have a broader view of both the supply and the demand side of the market . This is likely to mean that it will not starve certain markets and glut others , but will itself perform an important equalizing or stabilizing function . If because of this broad view , expert personnel , and adequate warehousing and financing arrangements it is able to avoid distress selling at harvest time or during periods of acute weakness in the market , it has some possibilities of reducing the speculative element in distribution and possibly also of carrying unavoidable speculative risks at a minimum of expense . All these are simply elements of efficiency which in greater or less degree may be achieved through largescale organization in any industry . There is , however , here , as in other large-scale business organizations , the possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to dominate the market and to cause prices to take on a monopolistic character . No one has yet succeeded in determining just when a position of bargaining skill and significance as a factor in the market-place passes over to one of control in such degree as to deserve the title " monopolistic . " It is clearly evident , however , that when a co-operative pool acquires the power and claims the right to withhold a product from market , either temporarily 1G1 AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION or permanently , it begins to move out of the clearly lighted area of distributive efficiency into a twilight zone of market control in which public opinion is pretty sure to assert its right to examine , and possibly to restrict , market adjustment or manipulative activities . It is to be borne in mind , of course , that the perishable character of many farm products . and the fact that co-operatives have little or no control over the processes of production , make the danger here much less than in the case of so-called " natural monopolies , " or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidation in the ownership or operation of the productive plant . Later chapters will develop in some detail the actual situation as to the market control practices of co-operatives and of the attitude of courts with reference thereto . It is our purpose here merely to show how the exigencies of co-operative business have called for several types of internal pooling arrangements , and the way in which such pools develop in the direction of practices at least superficially resembling market control or monopoly . It can hardly be denied that during certain aggressive campaigns for the organization of large co-operatives during the last few years the leaders themselves have lent color to the idea that they thought that the form of organization which they were developing with 50 , 60 , 75 , or 90 per cent of the producing group tied to the association by a // long-time binding contract would give them power to exact a profitable price not so much through skill in distribution as through control of the supply situation . This idea of co-operation as a means of exacting a cost-plus price has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gradually faded out of the minds of even the more radical under the disillusioning experiences of the last few years . ' It is only natural , however , that honest believers in the efficacy of large-scale co-operative organization should , in trying to make the most convincing argument as to its value , 7 be tempted // rather to overstress the coercive power of centralized control . An interesting handling of this difficulty comes from the National Pecan Growers ' Exchange : Some of the advantages offered by co-operative marketing may be summarized as follows : 1 . CENTRALIZED CONTROL . A million pounds of nuts offered through one hand will bring good prices and stabilize the market ; but a million pounds offered from many different sources and indiscriminately dumped in a few of the principal centers will break the market into smithereens . 2 . STANDARDIZATION , which means curing , grading , classifying and packing to a standard so that dealers will place absolute reliance in the grade and brand . 3 . STAIiLIZAToN OF THE MARKET , which means that dealers will have confidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken . 4. 1 ) IsTHInOTION , which means opening up new markets and conserving old ones . When a product is confined io a few markets congestion results and prices become demoralized as production increases . When each grower sells for himself some markets will be flooded and others hare ; but when marketing is centralized in our co-operative Exchange , the crops , no matter how large , can he distributed with systematic precision and an even balance maintained . 5 . ( ; Row Nits Fix PRICES under co-operative marketing ; otherwise independents and speculators fix the prices . Growers , do you recognize the value of this to you ? Think it over . These contracts are all firm at our opening price , whatever price this association makes . ' I ) id you growers or any of you ever in your lives hear of a condition where you could make contracts with buyers of your products , a signed , good contract firm at any price you choose to fill in on it ? Any man ever chance to hear of such a thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aaron , " Co-operative Marketing , " American Farm Bureau Federation , Bulletin No. 4. // 6 . ELIMINATION OF SPECULATION , which means that the speculators ' net profits will be distributed to the growers as extra profit . It is a fact that elimination of the middleman 's profit , under co-operative marketing , not only raises the price to the grower but actually tends to reduce it to the consumer . Before the almond growers were organized the average return to the grower was about 6 cents per pound for Nonpareil ; but since they organized the average return for Nonpareil has been 17 cents and more per pound and yet the price to the con sumer was not raised . This result was brought about by elimination of speculation and wider distribution of almonds ! ' Recent leadership has shown a commendable ten dency to warn against the more extreme views of market control . The Secretary of the National Council of Farmers ' Co-operative Marketing Asso ciations recently spoke as follows : I do not like to put myself in a negative attitude towards anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time has come , however , for those in positions of responsibility in the co-operative movement to face the fact that some members of co-operatives have many false notions about what their associations can and should do . These fallacies must be boldly attacked and uprooted if we are to have the unity of aim and purpose and the loyal support of our membership necessary to make the movement efficient and successful . . . . 1 . A co-operative can not monopolize supply and arbitrarily fix high prices . In the first place , no co-operative can monopolize the supply of any farm product . In the second place , if it did obtain monopoly control and forced prices " out of line , " it would destroy itself and bring loss'and disaster to its members . The // immediate result of monopoly prices of farm products would be decreased consumption and increased production . The holdings of the co-operative ( held off the market to drive prices up ) would have to be sold sometime to pay members and when that was done prices would drop . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coming to harvest and the cooperative would be swamped . . . . The utmost that a farmer 's co-operative can do , or should try to do , is by intelligent merchandising to secure for its members the highest prices which a fair consideration of supply and demand and general business conditions will justify . By control of a sufficient volume of production , a co-operative may eliminate wastes and costs of distribution , may shorten the route to market , and by preventing temporary and seasonal gluts and congestion nary bring about fairer and more equitable basic price levels . . 3 . A co-operative can not sell at prices which will equal cost of product ion plus a profit to all its members . Certainly it , can not do that until all members become highly skilled and economic producers , and are able to prevent crop loss and damage of all kind . Commodities must be pooled and sold in the market at the best prices obtainable . Special prices can not be obtained for members who practice expensive methods of farming or who lose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insects or plant diseases . 4 . Co-operatives can not sell bumper crops for as high unit prices as small crops . Larger crops mean lower prices , and when farmers produce an over-supply their co-operatives can not prevent prices going lower . They may extend markets , find new uses , convert lower grades and culls into useful by-products and in many other ways aid in price maintenance , but heavy production is certain to bring lower prices . . . . 5 . A co-operative can not make its pool prices higher than occasional sales by non-members . One of the aims of a co-operative is to substitute merchandising for // dumping . Merchandising means , for one thing , orderly selling throughout the period of consumption . Every market has its high points and its low points during a season . A co-operative moves its supply to market in an orderly manner , guided by the judgment of skilled salesmen well supplied with market information . Each member receives an average or pool price for the pooling period , which is never as high as the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest price . .. . But the main reason why such a comparison is unfair is because it is not the aim of a co-operative merely to get higher prices for its members than outsiders receive , but to make a good market upon which all may sell . THE REAL TEST IS : WHAT WOULD THE PRICE TO FARMERS HAVE BEEN HAD THE CO-OPERATIVES NOT BEEN IN THE FIELD ? . . . 9 . A co-operative with only a small percentage of the total supply can not be a dominant market factor . So long as an overwhelming majority of producers of a particular crop stay outside of the co-operative and give aid and comfort to the speculative system , no one has a right to taunt the co-operative with its failure to ac complish price stabilization . There is a fruitful field for a properly organized co-operative handling only a small percentage of the crop , but it should not be held respon sible for the continuance of the speculative system and the evil of low and fluctuating prices . Give the co-op a chance to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . ' Of course opinions still differ within the ranks of the co-operatives themselves as to policies or tactics to be followed either in general or in particular in-stances . It is only to be expected also that opinion on these matters will continue to change in the future as new individuals come into the movement // or as new situations develop . Hence , while pooling as a commercial practice may be regarded as well established , the precise uses to which the method may be put from time to time will continue to raise questions for both co-operators and courts to wrestle with . ( See Chapters X , XIV , and XV . ) Obviously the significance of the pooling method of conducting business will depend largely upon the degree of control over the product which may be acquired by any co-operative association . This in turn depends upon the character , duration , and enforceability of the contract relations between an association and its individual members . We shall need , therefore , in the following chapter to examine the origin , growth , and present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure and management of present-day co-operative associations . CHAPTER VIII THE EVOLUTION OF THE MEMBER 'S CONTRACT AT many points our discussion has stressed as the distinctive feature of co-operative organization the fact that it brings together a group of persons engaged in a common undertaking to set up a mutual agency for the performance of one or more of the functions needful to their business on the basis of service at cost . Whereas the ordinary profitseeking corporation goes into the open market to attract patrons and secure patronage on a competitive basis , co-operation aims to eliminate the costs of such competitive sales promotion or other methods of business development by bringing together in advance a suitable volume of business which shall , without further cost , be somewhat permanently organized for economical and efficient handling by the common service agency . This permanent and non-competitive mobilization of a profitable volume of business is incidental to the fundamental structure characteristic of the co-operative association . That is , the co-operative is made up by simply coalescing the individual bits of business of participating members for group marketing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 171 // a feature of this distinctive organization , therefore , it is important that the responsibilities and commercial obligations of such a participating member to the group agency , as well as his rights to use it and share in its benefits , shall be clearly set forth as a part of its fundamental structure . In reviewing the several steps by which more adequate enabling acts have been put upon our statute books , we have had occasion already to refer to the fact that the member 's contract has come to be accepted by legislatures as a desirable and proper means of achieving this end . It is important however , not merely that we should observe such general provisions of present-day statutes , but also that we should examine in detail the precise forms of contract which are being drawn under the authorization of such statutes , and the attitude which has been taken by the courts with reference to the terms of these contracts , and the legal measures which may be employed in their enforcement . Examination of the development of case law on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the present chapter and the one which follows , we shall examine not merely the characteristics of members ' contracts which are in vogue at the present time and of measures designed to secure their enforcement , but shall precede this by a historical analysis of earlier and simpler efforts toward defining and securing the member 's support of his co-operative agency . // I. THE " MAINTENANCE CLAUSE " The economic theory underlying co-operation envisages the introduction of economies and the increase in efficiency of operation as a result of the positive and personal effort made by the member in behalf of his mutual organization ? a collaboration such as is lacking in the case of ordinary competitive business . Against this engaging ideal , however , stands the practical fact that a perennial weakness among co-operative enterprises by and large has been their inability to secure this consistent and whole-hearted support on , the part of their membership . Co-operatives therefore early found it essential to introduce into their forms of organization a definite discipline designed to strengthen and preserve the initial interest and loyalty of their members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet this need by adopting a by-law providing that any member who disposed of his product outside his association should reimburse the co-operative by some stipulated amount for each unit of product so delivered . Such a provision was referred to as the " maintenance clause " or , particularly by outsiders , as the " penalty clause . " The purpose and theory of such a provision may be briefly explained . If a co-operative association is to engage in commercial undertakings and put itself in a position to serve its members effectively it must hire em174 AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION ployees , build or lease property , purchase equipment , arrange financing , or make other forward commitments characteristic of any well-managed business . All such planning must be based upon some reasonably predictable volume of business . If , after such commitments have been made , the expected volume fails to materialize , expenses will be unnecessarily high , the reasonably expected benefits will fail to appear , and frequently the whole enterprise will be involved in economic failure and , quite possibly , financial loss to the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to out-distance their more ponderous rivals . But this means that , in case of attack , they are in a comparatively weak defensive position . By contrast , the capitalistic corporation starts out with somewhat large accumulations of capital , and these are rather characteristically augmented in the course of successful business . This is calculated to put the corporation in a position to withstand competitive attacks even of the cut-throat variety . In scaling down such commercial defenses , co-operatives are thrown back for their success and even safety upon a reliance in the loyalty of the members and their continuance stoutly in the support of the co-operative enterprise in the face of any effort to hamper its operations or to impair its volume of business . Farmers have been notorious for being alert to dispose of any bit of product they may have ready for market at the place and in the manner where // they can get the highest immediate return for it . They are accused out of their own mouths of " shopping for the odd nickel " rather than adopting a consistent policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their marketing conditions . This , of course , is a generalization which applies to many individuals at particular times and places rather than to all farmers everywhere . The unquestioned success of numerous co-operative enterprises demonstrates this . However , private dealers whose business was curtailed or threatened with destruction by the coming of co-operative undertakings have not been slow to use their knowledge of farmers ' psychology to attack the co-operatives at a highly vulnerable point by bidding a little more than the co-operative felt itself in a position to pay and frequently more than the private dealer himself could pay an make a profit . Obviously , however , such a dealer could afford to accept actual losses for a time if by so doing he could prevent his co-operative rival from fulfilling its obligation to buyers , or could greatly increase its unit cost by reducing the volume of business handled , or could alienate membership permanently or for a time long enough to force the co-operative to the wall . Such tactics have been successful in many cases , but have naturally led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first successful instance seems to have occurred as early // as 1889 in the case of the Rockwell ( Iowa ) Farmers ' Elevator . Farmer grain companies of that day came into being primarily because line elevator com panies with ' a monopoly of the market at many local stations were quoting prices disproportionately low compared with those at terminal markets . A line elevator company , however , was in a peculiarly fa vorable position to retaliate by out-bidding any farmers ' elevator which tried to compete with it at a particular point . It could readily raise its quota tion in that particular town and absorb any local losses into the profits made over the whole system , or even gain it back subsequently at the same station by proportionately lower prices after the farmers ' company had been broken up . Certain shrewd observers of this situation rea soned that , all the farmer needed was a local outlet to the terminal market , where prices were at the very least ninth more equitably adjusted by the forces of competition than they were in the tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the necessary financial support to the local agency even when more profitable prices were being offered outside , they devised a by-law provision requiring all members to pay a fixed charge to their own com pany for every bushel of grain marketed , whether through this co-operative elevator or otherwise . The amount was ordinarily the same or slightly less // on grain sold outside than the handling charge upon grain actually shipped through the elevator . This payment was in the nature of an assessment upon each member for the maintenance of a selling agency designed to give him a free and open local market . It was most equitable that this charge should be made uniformly upon all products of a given kind which each member marketed . If he sold through the association the charge was deducted from his proceeds . If , however , he elected to sell outside the association , it devolved upon him to come to the local manager with a contribution of like amount . In case he failed to do so , the association would undertake to collect this sum from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea was not that it was a penalty upon the member for selling outside , for he was entirely free to do so if he saw fit , and indeed was often urged to do so if he could get a larger return for his product . The maintenance fee provided , on the one hand , that the farmers ' own selling agency should be maintained constantly available to furnish him a local market . At the same time it discouraged the practice of overbidding by competitors who were desirous of putting the co-operative association out of business . Under the operation of the " maintenance clause " such an overquoting buyer would soon find himself " hoist with his own petard . " The more patronage he attracted the greater would be his // losses , while at the same time the excess payment made to the producer would go wholly or in part into the treasury of the co-operative , thus main taining a producer shipping agency which would be prepared to pay up to the full market value at any subsequent time when the private dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the " maintenance clause " was thrashed out in Iowa in the days of the elevator fight about 1904.3 This was fully 15 years after the introduction of the " maintenance clause " in the by-laws of the now famous Rockwell Elevator . At that time the state grain dealers ' association set up // the claim that the payment of a service or mainte nance charge by members meant the defraying of operating expenses from an assessment , and thus put the farmers ' elevator having such a by-law in a position of unfair competition with non-co-opera tive companies . Commissioner Lane of the Inter-state Commerce Commission , who was conducting the hearings , found no merit in this contention , and shortly thereafter Mr. H. W. Byers , then Attorney General for the state of Iowa , gave an opinion favorable to such a by-law . This opinion was widely quoted and did much to strengthen the posi tion of the advocates of the " maintenance clause . " The practice of adopting such a by-law was spread ing in other nearby states in which the farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " maintenance clause " is worth examining for the light which it sheds on the real purpose and thought of those by whom it was developed . For this purpose , the statement promulgated by the state Farmer Grain Dealer As sociations through their official organ ' is presented below : The following will be found by co-operative companies a safe , reliable and effective amendment to their by-laws , wherever they wish to adopt the protection clause . This article has been drawn up by one of the best attor neys in the United States , and recommended by him as being entirely within the law and effective at the same time . We are therefore in a position to recommend its // use by any old company who wishes to amend their bylaws by adopting the PROTECTION CLAUSE , or for the use of new companies in protecting their business from the start . The term " PROTECTION CLAUSE " is important ; use no other term in adopting this plan . Be it RESOLVED by the Stockholders of that " WHEREAS said is a corporation organized in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " WHEREAS , the welfare and success of said depends largely upon the patronage of its stockholders , therefore be it " RESOLVED , that Article of the by-laws of said be amended by adding thereto a section to be known as Section in the words and figures following , to-wit : ? Every stockholder of this company , except as hereinafter provided , shall sell all of the grain which he markets to this company unless this company refuses to purchase the same at , a fair and reasonable price in the city of in the State of after a reasonable request so to do made by said stockholders . Provided , however , that if any stockholder shall reside , or his grain be raised miles or more nearer a market other than and he hauls to , and sells his grain at , such other market , he shall be exempt from the foregoing provision . Any stockholder of this company who shall violate the foregoing provision first above mentioned , shall , within thirty days of the delivery of said grain , pay to this company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such violation , and not as a penalty , the sum of per bushel of grain so sold in violation of said provision . // The amount or amounts for which any stockholder becomes indebted to this company on account of any violation or violations of any provision or provisions of this by-law , shall immediately become and constitute a lien upon and against the stock of any stockholder guilty of a violation of this by-law , also upon and against any sum or sums due to become due to said stockholder from this company . This general type of by-law has been employed quite widely not only by farmers ' elevators but by horticultural associations . For example , the Eastern Shore of Virginia Produce Exchange adopted a by-law in the following form : All members shall be required to market their farm produce exclusively through the exchange ? provided , however , that in case any member is offered a price plainly in excess of the market value of goods , for the obvious purpose of inducing him to break off his relationship with the exchange , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such offer without loss of membership rights . In this association violation of the above rule would result in expulsion of the member , but he might be reinstated upon his agreement to live up to this requirement in the future . The United States Department of Agriculture , when it entered this field of discussion at a relatively recent ( late ( 1920 ) , took the position that , while the " maintenance clause " had in the early farmers ' elevator movement provided an equitable means for contributing to the support of the co-o AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION erative company during an emergency , its real pur pose had later been lost sight of and it had been used as a coercive means to compel patronage . They therefore advised the abandonment of the " main tenance clause , " adding : In case it becomes necessary to meet conditions brought about by other dealers paying more for grain than it actually is worth in order to discredit the co-operative company , a direct personal appeal to the members , stating frankly existing conditions and prob able conditions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a better method . This might be followed by an attempt to protect and maintain the com pany in operation by means of a special contract arrange ment.5 In the same volume , therefore , there was presented a form for a " service and maintenance agreement " which would be distinctly bi-lateral in character and provide for a flat charge per bushel for a general and permanent market service made available to the patron by the elevator organization . ( For full text see Appendix G. ) Before passing on to show how the by-law pro-vision for a maintenance fee has been quite generally superseded by the crop contract binding the mem ber to exclusive dealing through the association , it should he noted that even the maintenance fee was attacked as being a penalty and operating in re straint of trade . In later chapters the issues // involved in this matter and the positions taken by various courts with reference to it will be carefully examined . Here , however , we are concerned simply in getting an understanding of what these several devices were ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operatives . II . MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS AND EXCLUSIVE DEALING To attempt to ascertain just when the first use was made of separate formal contracts between members of a co-operative association and their common marketing agency would involve great labor and have slight practical value . We read , however , that the Pachappa Orange Growers ' As sociation , ' formed near Riverside , " was the first // strictly co-operative citrus growers ' organization " and that during the spring of 1893 it put in opera tion a growers ' contract in the following terms : We , the undersigned orange growers of Riverside , Cali fornia , hereby agree to deliver the entire crop of oranges now growing in our respective orchards at the packing house of F. B. Devine in the said City of Riverside , there to be weighed , culled , graded , packed , sold , shipped cr otherwise disposed of under the management and super-vision of the Pachappa Orange Growers ' Association ? a Corporation organized and doing business under the law of the State of California ? upon a community basis jointly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Association from their own orchards and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a contract made and entered into by and between the said Cor poration and the said F. B. Devine and bearing date which we have read and ap proved and a copy of which is hereto attached . We also agree to pay our proportion of the general ex penses incurred by the said Corporation in handling and disposing of the fruit of the undersigned in connection and jointly with the fruit from the orchards of the mem bers of said Corporation upon a community basis as above stated . We further agree that any or either of the orchards of the undersigned may at any time for cause detrimental to the whole be ' excluded from partici pation in the handling of said fruit upon the community basis , as provided , by a two-thirds vote of the member-ship of said ( Corporation . The said Corporation agrees that the undersigned shall fully participate in the ship ment of their fruit upon the community basis as afore-said , in the manner herein described and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devine , and that they // shall receive their pro rata share of the net proceeds of the fruit so shippcd according to varieties delivered and in the manner prescribed for the distribution of the same . In employing a contract between the association and its members these people were simply carrying over into a co-operative undertaking what was already the established practice of commercial con cerns handling fruit . Private , packing houses had been in the habit of signing up growers on contracts just as sugar beet factories , canning and pickling companies , and seed houses still do in many parts of the country . The contract quoted is noteworthy in that it makes no special provision for liquidated damages or other remedies for breach of the con-tract or methods of securing its performance . The contracts with the private packers provided " first , that the fruit would be delivered at such time as the handler might want it ; second , that if the fruit was not so delivered , the handler had the right to pick , pack , and market the fruit at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten per cent on all costs incurred , 50 cents a box for packing and 10 per cent commission on gross returns ; and , third , that if any loss was sustained , the grower was obli gated to reimburse the commission firm . " 8 This indicates that the growers had before them an ex-ample which might well have been used as a prece dent for including some sort of damage clause in their own contract . Possibly their resentment of // such measures on the part of private handlers gave them a distaste for including anything of the sort in their own arrangements with members . At all events they soon found it necessary to do something to put teeth in the contract . " The grower , finding as his enthusiasm slackened that the new system was not a panacea for all marketing ills , at times changed his marketing plans . Indeed , as early as January , 1894 , a problem not entirely uncommon throughout later years was encountered . The Riv erside Fruit Exchange has obtained an order of court restraining from selling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell them through the Exchange . ' " 8 Gradually , however , these associations strength ened their contract by the introduction of a clause providing for liquidated damages in the event that fruit was delivered outside the association . In a great many cases a very simple type of contract continued to he used and it kept strictly to the prac tice of making the association merely the selling agent of the growers , that is , the product remaining the property of the grower until finally disposed of in the market . Such a contract ' appears below : We , the undersigned , growers of citrus fruits , being de sirous of having our fruit handled in a manner substan tially as set forth in the above by-laws , do , for such purpose , hereby severally constitute and appoint the California , a Corporation organized // under the laws of the State of California , our sole agent to pack and sell all citrus fruits which may be grown on , our respective orchards during the entire period of membership in said Corporation . We and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Corpora tion in handling and marketing said fruits shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of said fruit pro rata , according to the amount of fruit furnished by each of us respectively , and we and each of us agree to accept for the crop our pro rata share of the net proceeds of the sale of fruit furnished by us , after deducting the cost of packing , selling , and other necessary expenses . Nothing herein contained shall be construed to interfere with bona fide sales of orchard property . Any and each of us who will otherwise dispose of the merchantable fruit grown on the property hereby contracted , ( luring the period of this contract , shall pay to the Corporation the sum of twenty-five ( 25 ) cents for each and every packed box of commercial weight so sold , marketed , or consigned , as liquidated damages , as provided in the foregoing by-laws , which are hereby made a part of this contract . With the continued ' use of member contracts , however , there was a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , except in the case of perishable products , a growing desire or need on the part of the association to have title passed to it at the time of delivery of the product in order that processing , storage ( and the issue of warehouse receipts ) , and financing could be administered most effectively . These tendencies are evident in the so-called " uniform crop agreement " developed by the California Fruit Growers ' Exchange ' and by it recommended to the local packing house associa188 AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION tions . This contract 12 provided that " each of the second parties hereby sells and conveys , and agrees to pick , haul , and deliver to the first party for the purpose of packing , selling , and marketing , all the citrus fruits now growing upon his land , etc . . The first party agrees to receive , pack , sell , and market all of said fruit whenever a market may be found for the same , which , in the judgment of the first party shall justify such selling and shipment . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount received for his said fruit , less its regular charges for packing , shipping , selling , and marketing the same . " Since the marketing specialists of the Department of Agriculture who worked on the Department bill already discussed were concerned primarily with perishable products , it is perhaps not strange that the only sort of relationship between producer and co-operative association which they set forth was the agency relationship . And even as late as April , 1922 , when the Department offered a " Standard Form of Crop Contract , " 13 no reference was made to the fact that various co-operative associations dealing in semi-perishable or non-perishable prodTHE // ucts had found the sale and resale type of contract serviceable and had made substantial progress toward perfecting its form . This movement had progressed through several stages in the experience of the California co-opera tives , beginning probably with the Lima Bean Growers ' Association organized in 1909 . " In order to facilitate both pool handling and the securing of credit through the association , their contract , as drawn in 1912 , authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each of them the growers in its own name and in all respects as though said beans were in fact owned by it , treating all of said beans of the same quality as if commingled , and actually commingling them if such actual com mingling shall be deemed . . . necessary or con venient . " To this end , the contract included an // assignment of title in the following terms : " The growers for the purpose of carrying out the terms and provisions of this agreement do hereby transfer and assign their said beans to the Association , together with any warehouse receipts to be here-after issued therefor . " 15 The raisin growers of the Fresno district were likewise developing a centralized type of associa tion , and carefully studied the experience of the lima bean growers . Several of the general features of the bean contract are therefore to be found in the raisin growers ' contract of 1918,1 which is of the fully developed sale and resale type . This con-tract refers to the parties merely as the buyer and the seller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buyer does hereby purchase , and the Seller does hereby sell , all of the crops of raisins to be produced during the years , 1918 , 1919 , and 1920 on the following described land in at and for the following minimum prices net . to the Seller . . . 3 ? cents per pound for first crop of Muscats ; 3 cents per pound for second crop Muscats ; 31/ , cents per pound for Sultanas // This instrument is intended by the parties to pass to and vest in the Buyer a present title to all of the crops of raisins covered hereby , and to give to the Buyer the right to the possession of said raisins when and as they are placed in sweat boxes . . . . For the consideration herein expressed , in addition to the prices hereinabove agreed to be paid , the Buyer agrees to use its best efforts to re-sell said raisins at prices higher than the minimum prices so paid , and if it shall obtain such higher prices it will pay the excess over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the quantities and varieties of raisins received from the respective Sellers , first deducting , to be retained for itself , the sum of one-fourth of one cent per pound for all raisins received under such contracts , and also each Seller 's pro rata share of all expenses of the Buyer in curred in its operations during the twelve months next preceding October 1st in each year .. . . It has been thought necessary , or at least highly desirable , to embody this same sort of relationship in the newer " commodity marketing " contracts used in connection with cotton , tobacco , and other non-perishable products during the last few years . Ex perience seems to show that such a contract is favor-ably regarded by the bankers and business men with whom the co-operative association must do business . A good deal of doubt exists , however , as to whether , in a strictly legal sense , such an arrange ment is anything other than an agency in which , for purposes of convenience and effective handling of the business , the agent is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the case of // a recent Pennsylvania association ( the Pennsyl-vania Tobacco Growers ' Co-operative Association ) a contract was drawn which it was thought would meet all the needs for effective financing , storing , and selling of the product , but still on an agency basis , as required by the co-operative law of the state , which is virtually the Department bill of 1917.18 By the exercise of sufficient care in draw-ing the contracts , the necessary control and flexi-bility in operations can be secured even under the agency type of contract . On the other hand , it may well be argued that if the legislature of a state sees fit to pass a law in the general form of the Kentucky // Act of 1922,19 they thereby define the transaction between the member and his association as a sale . In a recent case 29 the Louisiana Supreme Court has taken the position that where the legislature has seen fit by statute to provide for a special form of sales contract the courts are bound to recognize such transactions as in fact valid sales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering sales contracts . Contracts of this form are particularly adapted to seasonal pooling and indeed are practically neces194 AGRICULTURAL CO-OPERATION sary for its successful execution.21 The initial sale price , as is indicated in the raisin contract above quoted , is simply the amount of the established first advance payment to growers . The raisin growers ' contract contains also ( see Appendix H ) a more de-tailed statement as to the pooling method of han dling the crop and several clauses designed to secure its enforcement . To the latter , further reference will be made in the following chapter . CHAPTER IX CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT DEVICES THE membership agreements which have been discussed in the preceding chapter fall under two general heads : ( 1 ) the maintenance or protection payment designed primarily to provide the running expense of the co-operative agency and thus keep it intact for use whenever the growers may wish to avail themselves of its services ; and ( 2 ) the exclusive dealing contract , designed primarily to bring all of the product of the given body of producers under the control and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply for the purpose of insuring a volume of business large enough and steady enough to permit of economical and efficient operation . In many cases , however , such measures are designed also to centralize control of a volume of product large enough to give to the selling agency a strategic position in the market and to strengthen its hand in " collective bargaining " with the large milk distributors , millers , packers , wholesale grocers , exporters , or others with whom they must deal . In achieving the first purpose it becomes important , and in achieving the second still more essen-195 // tial , that the ranks of the membership be kept intact and actual deliveries be maintained up to 100 per cent of the expected amount . Besides the tangible loss of a service fee on products not delivered to the association , there is the intangible loss in terms of inability to live up to its commercial commitments or to maintain its position as a supplier of an important or even indispensable part of the total market supply . The crumbling of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something which the executives and such members as wish to perpetuate the co-operative feel must be guarded against in every way possible , and for this it looks to the inclusion of suitable measures of enforcement . in the growers ' contract or in the by-laws which underlie it . I. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES The first of 1 he devices designed to secure such enforcement is the stipulation of liquidated damages in such amount as would reasonably compensate for the imponderable as well as the more tangible elements of loss suffered by the association through the breach of his contract by a member . Of course the principle of liquidated damages had . been in vogue among building contractors and others long before the co-operatives took it up . It had been introduced even in the relations of farmers to packing houses , sugar factories , and the like . The general philosophy of the matter as applied // to co-operatives is somewhat fully set forth , pre sumably for the edification and instruction of courts as well as members , in the " uniform crop agree . ment " developed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of the association was " to maintain and to increase to its greatest efficiency the present co-operative fruit sell ing and marketing agency , " the contract points out " that to accomplish this purpose it is necessary that each of the parties of the second part shall strictly and fully comply with and perform the stipulations of this agreement on his part , and therefore each of the second parties expressly stipulates and agrees that he will not sell or otherwise dispose of his said fruit to any person or corporation other than to said first party , as herein provided . " But to discourage wilful sale I of the product to someone other than the association , it was further provided : The actual damages which will be sustained by the first party because of the failure or refusal of any of the second parties to pick and deliver his said fruit as herein provided , and the further detriment and injury to the first party because of the effect of said breach upon // the and its efficiency , and the expenses to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by outlays incurred and to be incurred by it in providing means for selling and marketing the said fruit , are impos sible now to estimate or fix , and therefore the same are estimated and agreed upon as twenty-five cents ( 25c ) for each box of fruit grown or sold , which sum shall be allowed in any action brought by the first party to re-cover damages for the breach of this agreement by any of the second parties , should the first party elect , as it may elect , to bring such action . Reference to the California law of 1909 will show that no special statutory provision had been made for the enforcement of contracts of this character . Their validity and enforceability depended simply upon fundamental principles of common law , rein-forced by the general code provisions with reference to liquidated damages ( see pp. 283 , 304 , and 314 ) , or the discretion of the court sitting in equity to con sider what relief should be granted in the event of breach or threatened breach in particular instances . This sit cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gether satisfactory to co-operatives generally , and recent laws lherefore have sought to secure a posi tive legislat ive declaration of public policy as to the type of contract which is approved and the meas ures which iii their judgment might properly be invoked for its enforcement , instead of leaving this entirely to the views that particular courts might be found to entertain.2 // The first step toward covering the contract issue explicity in a statute came about when in 1917 the Bureau of Markets undertook to codify develop ments up to that time in the form of a bill suitable for passage by the several states and conforming to the requirements of the Clayton anti-trust law . The Department bill included a section authorizing by-laws requiring exclusive dealing , with the pro viso that an annual opportunity for withdrawal be allowed to the member . To this it added a pro-vision for liquidated damages as " specific , reason-able sums , in amounts fairly related to the actual damages ordinarily suffered in like circumstances , " the section ending with the words : " And any such provisions shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
