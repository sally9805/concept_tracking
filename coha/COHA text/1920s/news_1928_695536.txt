txt A sweeping rearrangement of the entire election machinery in New York City was decided upon yesterday by the Board of Elections to meet the situation caused by an unusually heavy registration and ? a shortage of voting machines . In a formal resolution the board scrapped most of an elaborate program prepared some months ago to , ' give efficient election service through cutting down the number of election districts and for the first time polling the whole city vote machines . At yesterday 's meeting the board took action to increase the number of election districts in the city by , more than 2,000 and confine the use of machines to Manhattan and Brooklyn . Several days ago the hoard announced that ' the shortage would prevent the use of machines in Queens and Richmond , and at yesterday 's meeting it was decided that to carry out the change of the election machinery the Bronx also must vote on paper ballots .

Officials of the Election Board , explaining the new progra.m , . traced the cause directly to the unexpected increase in registration , which sent the total for the cites above 2,000,000 for the first time . It had been planned to have one voting machine in each election district . Then it was pointed out that a voting machine could handle only a little more than 700 voters in the twelve hours the polls will be open , while in many election districts many more than 700 persons were registered . The board officials said it was obvious that something must be done to prevent the disfranchisement . of many voters , so it was decided to take the machines away from Queens and Richmond and place two machines in some districts . But even , this failed to meet the situation . It was said that even if paper ballots were used the registration was so in Manhattan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these districts with a voting machine the board found it necessary to take the machines not only out of Queens and Richmond but the Bronx as ? well . " While the hoard made a rrange. ments during the day to purchase 100 new machines , all that were available . Mr. Cohen said that even with the addition of the Bronx machines only a small reserve would be left after all the new districts in Manhattan and Brooklyn had been equipped . The same procedure.in splitting up districts will be followed in the boroughs where paper ballots will be employed , with the idea of facilitating voting and ensuring that every person who registered will have an opportunity ? to ? cast a ballot .

The hearing on the order was held before Justice Bijur , with John Holley Clarke Jr . representing Mr. Harvey .

He explained . that officials of the manufacturing company were on their way to the city to give testimony about the limited supply and asked an adjournment until Monday , ? which was granted by Justice Bijur . Mr. Harvey , in instituting the court action , had asserted that the use of paper ballots would deprive him " of thousands ' of . votes .
