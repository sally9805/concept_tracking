The gains of the Monarchists were described as " most spectacular , even for Bavaria . " <P> The continued trend toward the Right and Left was taken in some quarters as an ominous portent for the coming Reichstag election ( May 4 ) . Many moderate Germans professed keen alarm over the effect of the Bavarian election in foreign countries . <P> The great General Ludendorff was not , however , despondent . According to newspaper reports , he ran with exceeding swiftness to the Brgerbrau Keller , famed beer hall associated with a " brawl " ( TIME , Nov. 19 ) in which " Ludy " was one of the principal figures , to celebrate the Monarchist victory . There he delivered himself of an impassioned oration : <P> " April 1 ( when the verdict was given in the Ludendorff-Hitler trial ) was a day of shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Various elements have sought to crush the popular movement , but Heaven has raised it aloft .
