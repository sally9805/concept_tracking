Tucked away behind the mountains of Lombardy , the tiny Lago d'Iseo , famed retreat of Italian notables , appears to the eye of passing aviators like a single glistening twisted tear upon the scarred visage of a giant . Last week a salute of 21 battleship guns boomed across this diminutive strip of water . Tourists afloat in ornamental near-gondolas , all but toppled overboard in fright . Shading their eyes and looking about for a super-dreadnaught which was nowhere to be seen , they marveled . <P> That night the concierges of numerous hotels explained . The Duke of Aosta , gracious cugino ( cousin ) of His Majesty Vittorio Emanuele , had merely been greeted with the honors due his rank when he called upon famed Soldier-Poet Gabriele d'Annunzio at the latter 's villa beside the lake . <P> " But the guns ? The guns ? " cried the tourists . <P> " Ah , so simple ! To honor Signor d'Annunzio and to commemorate his heroism at Fiume , the Italian Government has presented him with the battleship Puglia . High and dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broadside in honor of Signor d'Annunzio 's distinguished guests . "
