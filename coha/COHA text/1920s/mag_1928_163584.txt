Nasty insinuations against Candidate Herbert Hoover sped like wasps , last week , to buzz in a secluded and exotic Chinese garden in the village of Tongka , not far from Canton . The lord of the garden and of the village-a model village-is the venerable Tang Shao-yi , perhaps the last great statesman of the fallen Manchu Regime to survive in dignity and honor . Round his placid head the nasty rumors and insinuations buzzed . Soon the old <P> Chinaman was dictating in indignation : " Information has reached me in my retreat that persons in America and China insinuate that Herbert Hoover acted dishonorably in dealings involving the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company a quarter of a century ago . ... I believe I am the only Cninese living who was closely identified with that company during Mr. Hoover 's connection . My uncle founded the company . . . . During the eighteen months Mr. Hoover was connected with the company , first as engineer and later as manager , it changed from a nonsuccess to a success , and continued as a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clean and honorable , highly creditable and in many ways remarkable . ... In my opinion Mr. Hoover took away from China far less than he rightly earned , and today he retains the respect of the Chinese in a degree equal to that of any foreigner who ever was connected with our country . " <P> Such testimony from an Elder Statesman with the majestic record of Tang Shao-yi is of weightiest import . His career began , like that of Candidate Hoover , in the development of large engineering enterprises and led to government posts comparable in China to that which Mr. Hoover now holds in the U. S. Tang Shao-yi was Managing Director of the Imperial Railways of North China in 1900 , and shortly afterwards became High Commissioner of Customs under the patronage of the great Viceroy of Chihli and subsequent President of China Yuan Shih-kai . Before the advent of the republican regime , Tang Shao-yi was sent to Washington as special Ambassador of the Manchu Emperor . Later he served as Prime Minister of the Government at Peking and as Minister of Finance under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellington Koo , Ambassador at Washington ; and today that post is held by his nephew-in-law , Dr. Alfred Sze . <P> In explaining his championship of Candidate Hoover , last week , Tang Shao-yi declared with emotion : " I am actuated ... by a sense of justice , and also by gratitude for Mr. Hoover 's acts in rescuing my family during the Boxer uprising . . . when he lived across the street from my family in Tientsin . <P> " One day a large Boxer shell struck my house , killing several , including my wife and fourth daughter . Mr. Hoover rushed over , risking his life , and helped rescue us while the house burned . " <P> Tang Shao-yi might have added the concluding detail that Rescuer Hoover wrapped up a Chinababe in his coat , during the fire , and dashed with her from the house . She , a daughter of Tang Shao-yi , grew up to become that very great and smart lady , Mrs. Wellington Koo , whose husband was , before 40 , ambassador to two big nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegate to international conferences , and to the League Assembly .
