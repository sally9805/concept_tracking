txt EDUCATION OF WORKERS . Its Relation to Trade Unions and the Federation of Labor . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I correct one statement of fact in your otherwise admirably clear editorial on the Conference for Progressive Labor Action ? You say that " Mr. Woll , for the federation , denies that there is need for such a thing as workers ' education . He asserts that the workers exert sufficient influence on the existing educational system . " This I have never said . What I wrote in my rejoinder to the " Challenge of the Progressives " was as follows : If workers ' education is less extended in this country , our movement believes this is mainly because labor exerts an influence on public schools and on education in all its branches far greater than does the movement in other countries . This is a statement of conviction which is based upon solid fact . Any student , for example , of the growth of workers ' education in Europe will be struck by the fact that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses which are similar to courses of study offered by our public educational institutions through night schools and university extension . Nor will it be denied , on the other hand , that in the development of our system of free public education American labor has had a record of consistent support and championship for a hundred years . But this is not equivalent to saying that there is no need " for such a thing as workers ' education . " I wish to affirm again , as I have repeatedly affirmed , that workers ' education is an indispensable necessity for the future development of the American trade union movement . There is no possibility of labor in this country adapting and re-educating itself to the rapidly changing char-1 acter of the machine age other than through a general program of workers ' education . The report on recent economic changes just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research , under the leadership of the committee appointed by President Hoover , is the latest and one of the most eloquent arguments for workers ' education to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have devoted myself to the promotion of the educational program as developed by the Workers ' Education Bureau , of which I have been an executive officer for seven years . My years of service have deepened my conviction of the need of workers ' education . I have dissented from the position that workers ' education and propaganda are one and the same ; that under the guise of a pseudo-workers ' education the trade unions should be dictated to in their legitimate field of policy making . Workers ' education has a great service to perform , but not in attempting to do what the unions were created to do . Workers ' education should seek to teach workers how to think . Workers ' education is a part of the general worldwide movement on the part of adult workers in the factories , mills , farms or offices alike to make education an instrument of their larger growth and deeper social understanding . MATTHEW WOLL , Vice President A. F. L. Washington , May 31 , 1929 . The Cop 's Origin in Brooklyn . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaching to the use of the term " cot , " to designate a policemen , referred to in today 's " Topics of the Times , " is that it should so soon have been forgotten . I was born in Clinton Avenue , Brooklyn , In 1834 . The police station of our precinct was on the southeasterly corner of Myrtle and Vanderbilt Avenues , and my earliest recollections of the patrolmen in that neighborhood include the fact that they wore heavy boots having a copper toe  --  a band of copper about half an inch in width built in to the toe of the boot between tile sole and the upper . These patrolmen were familiarly dubbed " coppertoes " and later " coppers . " As I left Brooklyn when 12 years old , I can not personally testify to the declension of " copper " to " cop , " but what more likely ? The fact that the British dictionaries had the latter form in their Issues for 1867 fits admirably in tile retrospect , RICHARD FERRIS . New York , May 31 , MO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading Tale TIMES 'S remarks on the word " cop " In your Issue of this date , I have been led to wonder whether it can have any connection with " cop " ? see " As You Like it , " H , 1:67 , and " Venus and Adonis " 888 . I have often heard the word used in the North of England as a verb , meaning " catch , " in speaking of a cricket ball , &c.; CHARLES H. SIMPSON . Elizibeth . N. J. , May 31 , ism For a Quiet Fourth . To the Editor of The New York Times : All day Wednesday sounds of pistol shots were heard , and one thought immediately of the noise that it seems Americans feel they must make on the Fourth of July . Yet Wednesday was not the Fourth , but the day before Memorial Lay . To those mothers and fathers who lost sons during that terrible lime only a few years ago this sound must have been heartrending . Today , when we are all thinking of those who gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free , the same shots-1 am hearing them now outside my window . I have called up the police station near my home , and have received a very courteous reply that my report would be investigated . I have found that the city departments welcome criticism and reports , and I feel sure that if our citizens would express their dislike of noise and shootling on the Fourth of July , some of the patriotic organizations would interest themselves . Many children are maimed and many are killed by our foolish noise every year . Mrs. CHARLES APPLETON TERRY . New York , May SC , 1929 . Aerial Advertising Annoys . To the Editor of The New York Times : Between 10 and 11 last night and on many other nights in recent months a large airplane with an advertising sign flew back and forth over my home at 130 West Fiftyseventh Street for an extended period . This plane carries a large illuminated advertising sign and emits at frequent Intervals a frightful blast that sounds like a foghorn . This is nothing short of a nuisance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of residents in the community . We can easily get along without this form of advertising , and I have been waiting patiently for some sign that the authorities Intend to take the proper steps against this flagrant violation of the rights of New York citizens to protection from unwarranted and highly irritating noise .
