txt At the very outset of the Genoa conference , , which opened here today , there was a clash on the question of disarmament raised by M. Tchitcherin. the Soviet Foreign Minister , and emphatically objected to by Louis Barthou , head of the French delegation . It was smoothed out by Mr. Lloyd George , who suggested that the agenda be followed , no discussion of land armament being provided for , and M. ' ToilIt7. eherin bowed to the will of the confer. ; ence . ? Prime Minister Facto , of Italy opened the meeting with a speech of welcome . Mr. Lloyd George answered and nominated ? Signor 1 ! 7acta for the permanent Chairmanship . M. Barthou seconded the nomination and the election ww. made unanimous . Lloyd George at ills Best . ? Mr. Lloyd George then took the floor . . I have seen the little Welshman at a rather considerable number of conferences . He was in- his best form today . It was his conference , his to make it a success or failure . He knew ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European nations the world had ever seen and that its results for better or for worse would ' affect the whole world . And then he grave ' his first punch . " We meet here on equal terms , " he said . " We are not here allied or neutral States . we are not here belligerents or neutrals . We do not cqrne together as republicans , monarchists or soviet1st* . We are here as the representatives of all the peoples of Europe , to seek out in common the best methods . of yestoring the shattered prosperity of Lis t , continent . " As they met on equal terms they met under the same conditions . The conditions laid clown at Cannes were those re.:ognized by civilized nagons , and if any one present did not accept them he might as well depart . The speaker outlined the conditions thus : " First , when a country enters into contractual relatIons with another country or its nationals for , value received , that contract can not be repudiated whenever a country exchanges Governments unless the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war on the institutions Of another .. Third , one nation shall not engage in offensive operations against the territory of another . Fourth , the nationals of one country shall be entitled to impartial justice in any other country . Mr. Lloya George then said that the war had ended three years ago , but that the pulse of commerce  --  was now beating feebly and Wildly . " There is unemployment in the West . In the East there Is famine and pestilence , " he said . " What is the first need of Europe ? . he asked . " Peace  --  real peace . We propose ' to study cOrrency . Good ! We propose to study transports . ' Good ! But unless peace is established , all that will amount to nothing . Too Many Snarling Dogs . " There is no real peace In Europe , " continued the British Prime Minister . " Fighting has ' ceased , but snarling goes on , and as there are many dogs In every country who imagine that the louder they bark and the longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Europe is deafened with this canine clamor . " As he uttered those words a visible stir went over the crowded hall .. continued : " It is undignified , it is distracting , . it destroys confidence . It wrecks ' the nerves of a nerve-racked continent , avid wc ; shall make a real contribution tollie restoration of Europe if at this conference we can stop that snarling . . " Europe needs quiet . We can get peace if we act together , but not if vie act in a spirit of greedy vigilance over selfish interests . The success of this conference will be measured by the good . we do and not by the good we do not do . Let us think more of what we can accomplish than of what we can restrict . " Mr. Lloyd George then turned- his attention to the question of public opinion , the state of , which in France had ' been advanced as a reason for going slowly , and said : " Public opinion Is not like the Alps : it is , amenable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ; in every land it will yield a good ' deal to an appeal by the common statesmanship. ut Lurope . " He added as he turned toward M. Barthou : " Public opinion in any country can . be taught that .. the good of another country is not necessarily an evil for its own . . ' - ? " The worlii.is one unit . It is.UPt Ws , two ? hernisphei-es . It ' is one . round. ? ituvi broken sphere . For that reason I regret that the great American Republic is not represented here . However , much that has happened and much that is now happening in Europe makes Americans cautious of mixing in our affairs . But if we can set things right at this conference I feel sure that America will not only come in , but come in gladly . " A distinguished citizen of this city once upon a time discovered America , and I am hopeful that Genoa will render another immortal service to humanity by enabling America to discover Europe . " Mr. Lloyd George referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom would tell the truth about the conference and some of whom would not . Nevertheless their presence , he said , showed interest because the papers would not pay their board bills unless ' they thought their readers were interested in what was going on here . He continued : " The world will follow our deliberations ' with hopes and with fears . If we fail , a sense of despair will sweep over the world . If we succeed , a ray of confidence will burst through the gloom that clouds the spirit of mankind . " Barthou Pledges Co-operation . M. Barthou did not reply to Mr. Lloyd George directly , instead reading a typewritten statement which he probably brought with him from Paris . He denied that the French had come as observers but said they were real fellow-workers in the conference . What France wanted was to make haste slowly . As far , is affecting restoration after the war was concerned he offered the opinion that France had done about as good a job as anybody . He denied that France was out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody who let her alone . " The rights of France , for which she paid a terrible price , are not an obstacle to the work which we have come here to accomplish , " he went on . " The Cannes program has put them beyond discussion . The Genoa conference did not , can not be and will not be a court before which existing treaties can be brought up , judged and revised . " He said France did not intend to take a negative attitude all along , but that she had valuable suggestions to offer though no hope that the Genoa conference was going to cure Europe of all its ills . The French delegation will never pronounce one word of hate . " he declared . " It desires no one 's humiliation . It has nothing to hide . It is inspired by good faith and good-will . ' Peace and work is the program of France . " After M. Barthou , Viscount Ishii of . the Japanese delegation said that on the basis of the Cannes resolution Japan wanted to co-operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the loss of European markets and the instability of exchange . He added that the Japanese delegation was there to protect the interest of all Japanese subjects . After him Prime Minister Theunys of Belgium promised the co-operation of his country . Chairman Facta had said in his opening address that acceptance by the Powers of the invitation to the conference carried with it the assumption that they accepted all the conditions attached to the invitation , therefore there was considerable interest in the next two speakers to see if they dissented . Long , Dry Speech by Wirth . Chancellor Wirth of Germany spoke next . In a crowded and hot room speaking before an assembly which had listened to speeches in three languages he made the mistake of presenting a long dissertation composed of economic generalities which sounded much as if his fellew delegate . Dr. Rathenau , in a day of leisure . perched upon some tellectual Mount Olympus , had written it . Dr. Wirth read it in German . The translator , who spoke bad French , then rendered it . and ' following that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wirth said Germany had come to work for the economic reconstruction of Europe . but he left little doubt that he was thinking more about the economic reconstruction of Germany . ' He did not mention reparations , but the spokesman of the nation responsible for the war talked twenty minutes about the necessity of brotherly love and kindness in the world , and spoke of the domestic difficulties of Germany and of Germany 's peculiar needs in tones which seemed to show lack of realization that there were sicker nations than Germany around the table . Dr. Wirth distinctly did not have a success . That can be explained by the fact that tie could not discuss thee subject so dear to his heart . The British had advised him not to talk about reparations . Tehlteherin Gets the Floor . Following the interminable translation into French and English it was M. Tchitcherin 's turn . The tall . angular Russian - Foreign Minister . who was an official of the Czarist regime , seemed thoroughly ' at home . In a high nasal voice he read in French a. prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was M. Tchitcherin who stirred up M. Barthou . Naturally enough , on Russia 's reentrance into international society and on Pie occasion of the first participation of the Soviet Government in international conversation , the Soviet spokesman saw it a little differently from the French , who not only are used to conferences but tired of them . M. Tchitcherin went on the basis that the Genoa conference was going to solve everything . or at least consider everything . He saw it as the : first of a great series of such conferences . He saw it as marking the organization of a system which was to lead to a " universal conference . " As far as Russia was concerned , he seemed ready to promise anything . " Russia has not come here to do propaganda . " he said . " Russia has come here to co-operate in the economic reconstruction of the world . " He said the world needed Russia . and Russia needed the world . The Soviet Government was willing to give all fitting guarantees to the foreign business nationals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to grant many concessions , and he added- significantly that Russia 's offer would open Siberia to all the world . Then he said Russia was perfectly willing to talk disarmament . She was willing to reduce her army provided other nations reduced theirs and promised to let Russia alone . Russia would ask for long-term loans . Barthou Quick to Retort . Every one thought the session over . It was nearly 7 o'clock . But M. Barthou was on his feet . He said he did not want to cause an incident , did not want to raise a row , but France could not pass in silence what M. Tchitcherin had ' Said . The Genoa conference was based on the Cannes program . The Cannes program would not set up a system of conferences opposed to the League of Nations . Further , it had been agreed that there should be no discussion of disarmament at this conference . M. Tchitcherin , he said , spoke of a coming universal conference and general disarmament discussion . He asked if this would be permitted . If Tchitcherin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M. Barthou said , the answer of France was " a definite , categorical , decisive , final no . " He wanted a ruling then and there . M. Tchitcherin got up and quoted Premier Poincare in a Chamber speech as agreeing with him that the Cannes program was not very clear . He quoted Mr. Lloyd George in the Commons that the Genoa conference would be the first of a series , and quoted M. Briand as saying at Washington that the Russian Army ought to be reduced . " Of course we not tell . us . But we did know that at Washington M. Briand told Me . Hughes that France could not cut down her army because Russia had a big one . We ? thought ' that if we offered to disarm then France could do so , and we would . be , helping all round . We are very song if we were wrong , and since we have been invited to confer , of course we will abide by the rules . " M. ? Tchitcherin sat down amid appe. discomfort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , who had previously banged the " - French , would do it again , and had ho - done so the French delegation would unquestionably have left Genoa . He did . nothing of-the sort . He rose , all smiles . - He bowed to M. Tchitcherin and bowed to M. Barthou . " Nothing is quite so explosive as a peacq conference , " he said . We have been trying assiduously , some of us for three years , to get a conference of all Europe with the Russians in it . Every time I have failed because some of the subjects wounded ' the sensibilities of certain nations . Now at last we - are here , all together . Do n't let 's break it up yet . " As for the extra subjects M. Tchitcherin wanted to bring in , I ask him not to insist . He will find enough to do here . As for other conferences , I did say something about them , but then . there is the League of Nations . As for a universal conference , including everybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . I do n't believe I could last through a universal conference . I am sure M. Tchitcherin will not insist . GENOA , April 10 ( Associated Press ) . ? * I was an imposing assembly that Premier Facta of Italy faced when he rose to open the conference in the historic Palace of St. George . The delegations were seated at tables ranged about the hall , with the representatives of the principal Allies in the foremost places . The Italian delegation sat at the end of the hall , facing the main entrance . On the right of the Italians were seated the French and Japanese delegations , and on the left the British and Belgian . The other delegations sat at tables placed at right angles to the main one , the seating being in alpha-. betical order , resulting in the grouping of the nations as follows : First table  --  Albania , Austria , - Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia . Second table  --  Denmark , Esthonia , Finland and Germany . Third table  --  Greece , Latvia , Luxembourg , Norway and The Netherlands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sweden . Switzerland and Hungary were seated at two additional small tables . General interest centred on Premier Lloyd George and the Bolshevist delegates . Both the British Prime Minister and the Soviet delegation arrived after all the other delegates , and the expectant crowd stirred audibly and began a demonstration , which was quieted by hisses from the spectators anxious to have the meeting opened . Those gathered in the assembly hall were clearly disappointed in the five rather formal appearing men who made up the Soviet representation . These delegates wore morning coats and black ties and were attired otherwise in the conventional manner , though the spectators seemed to think that they ought to have a different appearance . Tchitcherin , Litvinoff , Krassin , Rakovsky and Joffe occupied the chairs assigned to Soviet Russia , or rather to Russia , for ? the conference recognizes these men as the spokesmen of all Russians directly under the Moscow Soviet Federation end affiliated thereto . The United States was represented unofficially by the American Ambassador to Italy . Richard Washburn Child . Four hundred correspondents , representing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery of the hall , and there were also many photographers present . Five hundred distinguished visitors - and unofficial observers were ranged about the walls of the main floor . The delegates sat at tables in the centre of the hall . Facto . Explains Conference . Premier Facta was applauded . as he rose , to make his opening speech . He observed that the conference was an international humane organization which had met to remedy all the evils from which Europe was suffering . " There are no longer enemies and friends , " he continued ; " there are neither victors nor vanquished . There are only men of one nation and another who wish to unite all their energies- to reach together a very noble end . We must first re-establish peaceful relations between the nations , that - they may co-ordinate their national energies , which have been entirely , destroyed by the war . We must also study the whole series of economic and financial problems ; and you may rest assured that Italy will carry out any resolution likely to guarantee lasting peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the dark cloud of the Pacific vanish . At Genoa we must work for the peace of Europe . So far as the economic aspect is concerned Italy is ready to remove all obstacles which are putting hindrances in the way of development of commerce by a policy of prohibition or protection . " As regards financial questions Italy will appreciate any solution calculated to reduce the inflation of paper money , to stabilize exchanges and to make possible the collaboration of the stronger States with the weaker . The international community can be saved only if independence , autonomy and sovereignty are equally guaranteed to the various States . Without that it would be vain to hope for reconstruction and the resumption of normal commerce . " It is , therefore , under the shield of the principles of equity , justice - and solidarity between the nations that this conference is opening . " The Premier then read the welcoming message to the delegates from- King Victor Emmanuel . There was an atmosphere of breathless , expectant silence as Prime Minister Lloyd George of Great Britain rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference . Louis Barthou , head of the French delegation , immediately seconded this proposal , which was approved by acclamation . .. Mr. Lloyd George evoked applause and much laughter when in the ' course of his speech he said Genoa did America a. great service by sending Columbus to discover the New World , and she could do America another great service by helping America to rediscover Europe . Chancellor Works of Germany was - the only delegate whowas not cheered when he rose to speak .
