" Names make news " Last week the following names made the following news : <P> <P> David Lloyd George , strode , for the first time in his long life , upon a public race track . He wore a light blue hat , dark blue coat , many-colored bow tie . He seemed happy to see the horses run and lather ; but he placed no bets . He , a Welsh Baptist , has long found his strongest support among sections of the British public which frown upon horse racing . Yet he caused more excitement at the track than the horses themselves . <P> <P> Rev. Dr. William Archibald Spooner , onetime warden of New College , Oxford , celebrated last fortnight his golden wedding anniversary . He has long been aware that he is the cause of the appearance of the word " spoonerism " in the Oxford English Dictionary .

In 1879 , Dr. Spooner announced a hymn as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , he has been labeled the author of countless spoonerisms . But , on his golden wedding celebration , he stoutly maintained that " Kinquering Congs " was his one and only spoonerism , that it was a slip of his tongue . <P> Other famed spoonerisms : <P> " It is kistomary to cuss the bride . " <P> " Have you , my brethren , ever nurtured in your bosom a half-warmed fish ? " <P> <P> Saint Joan of Arc was declared last week Saint of Wireless by French amateurs and French navy wireless operators . <P> <P> In Paris , daughters of Georges Clemenceau , 87 , took him to see , last week , his first cinema : shots of himself , the Tiger , in his remote walled garden by the sea . Crowds cheered the astonished and happy old spectator . <P> <P> Helen Wills recently set the Los Angeles Tennis Club clucking and fussing . They invited her to play at their tournament and in expectation had " some lovely silver " engraved with her name . She refused to attend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , which her mother feared might cause osteomyelitis ( inflammation of the bone ) . <P> <P> Alice Anne Montgomery , Duchess ( in her own right ) of Buckingham and Chandos , returned from Scotland with her usual autumn armful of water colors , including one of a woman 86 years old which Her Grace calls Grannie in the Moors . <P> <P> Henry Ford himself drove a new Ford sedan 60 m.p.h. for 8,000 feet , last week , to celebrate the opening of a new stretch of road near Wayside Inn , Sudbury , Mass . On the day before , Mrs. Henry Ford had made a speech before the Women 's National Farm &; Garden Association , * characterizing her husband as " easy going . " She also said that he had purchased Wayside Inn to save it from becoming " a common roadhouse . " <P> <P> John Pierpont Morgan might well have said last week : " A reckless liar named Bernard F.
