THE heavy-footed moving men have come and gone , but their ghosts linger on the stairs . The populace wears a drawn look around the eyes , and there is a haggard expression on the faces you see in the street . The Consolidated Gas Company locked up 52,905 meters , unlocked 43,384 , their men creeping about the town at midnight , locking , unlocking , locking , unlocking . The Telephone Company changed three hundred and fifty thousand telephones , their men slinking out with an instrument under an arm , slinking back in the next day with another to put in its place . It was an eerie time , a time of grand pianos and mattresses and old boxes of love letters , a gas time , a telephone time , when life itself was smothered under its own cumulus . A gaseous people we are , moving restlessly about from one abode to another , phoning each other constantly . S after noon a cab drew k J up to Carl Schurz Park , opposite Miss Chapin 's school , and a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park leisurely , and at down on a bench near ours , overlooking the river . From a paper bag under her arm she drew forth a triple-deck sandwich , a paper cup , and a small bottle of red wine . From her purse she produced a corkscrew . Arranging all neatly on the bench , she lunched , quietly and somewhat pensively . A poplar tree sketched thin restless shadows on the walk between us . In the river a ferryboat belonging to the Department of Plant and Structures paced back and forth . The piping sound of child voices composed a medley with the piping of tug whistles . When she had finished lunch , the lady sat for a while , smoking . Then she gathered up the wax paper , deposited it with the empty bottle in a rubbish can , hailed a cab , and drove off . She was quite beautiful . GRAM MAR-SCHOOL days were the days of our greatest valor . Life was red and real , and some boy was always " after " us . Looking through the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valorous times are gone . Very recently we sat in the parlor of a mother ; her twelve-year-old son arrived home from school in a cab , and came into the room doing a little tap dance . " Heavens , where did you learn that ? " his mother asked . " At school , " said the dandy fellow , " you know , 13i11 Robinson stuff . " So saying he snatched a bonbon from the table , executed a neat routine across the floor , and disappeared into the pantry  --  presumably to mix himself up a Bacardi , mHE crystal dome of John Ward 's 1 shoe store in Fifth Avenue is probably familiar to everybody by this time , but unless you have happened to pass there at seven o'clock in the evening , you have no knowledge of its cylindrical secrets . At that hour , all shoes have disappeared , the centre cylinder is bottomless , and a little hand of spectators has gathered to await developments . Slowly , and with a majesty which surpasses the ascent of the Roxv orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the centre of which crouches a gigantic negro . As the platform nears street level , the negro , swaying on his Afric hams , rises to his full height and begins washing the glass . To he allowed , just once , to make this sparkling entrance is now our chief desire in life  --  transcending our former chief desire , which was to roller-skate down the ramp in Grand Central . SOMEONE with authority ought to draw up a code of punishments for barbers . For cutting too short around ears , we recommend public whipping . Soap in the eye should merit ducking in the Bronx Park seal tank . Towel drawn roughly across neck against grain , suspend fifteen minutes by heels from tall building . Changing height of sideburns , drink a bottle of liquid soap . Moth marks in hack of neck , burn at the stake . Those are a few suggestions . Why should barbers be permitted to work irreparable wrongs and go unscathed ? The way things arc now , when you sit down in a barber chair , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance the barber takes ? Barron NATIONAL prosperity was Clar- ence W. Barron 's business , and ? - Guernsey cows were his hobby . When he died last week , the country was prosperous , and his herd at Cohasset , Mass. , was one of the finest in the world . He achieved the prosperity by a. sort of professional optimism in his financial-news reports and in his publication , the Wall Street Journal . He achieved the Guernsey herd by going direct to the Island of Guernsey and almost buying the place out . The farmers of Guernsey were familiar with his bluff manner and bristling white beard through his repeated visits there . They vaguely thought always that he was the President of the United States . Barron used to lie abed mornings at the Ritz , a telephone propped on his thunderous chest , receiving his editors and brokers and friends , dictating market stories , bawling orders . He had no humor , but a terrific gusto . His swift mind found bright facts in dull figures . He out-talked anybody . At four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at midnight he was still working . When he travelled he was impatient of the slightest delay  --  never boarded a train till the moment it started . He shuttled between Boston and New York for many years , always tak ing along about a dozen hand grips . No matter where he was bound , he despised trunks . " Bag , " he used to say , " bag goes with you . Use porter . Use lots of porters . Take things with you . Trunk goes in another car  --  never shows up . " He was probably the greatest employer of Red Caps along the Atlantic seaboard , and conductors used to hold trains when they saw his retinue approaching . Barron grew his beard when he was a young man , so he would n't have to waste time shaving . He used one hairbrush for thirty-five years one that came from the World 's Fair . He never folded money , but carried a capacious pigskin wallet and kept his hills always flat . In his travels he always carried a Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase . He read from it daily ; he was a devout man . His blue-ribbon dairy was started as a charity and operated at a loss . The cream was the talk of the countryside : blueberries did n't sink in it . Barron always insisted that milk was the greatest food for everybody , and sometimes lived a fortnight on a milk diet . Normally he was a heavy eater and had little control over his appetite , but he neither smoked nor drank . Of late years he frequently visited the Battle Creek sanitarium for rest cures , and it was there he died . In getting news , Barron used a direct method of attack , careless of people 's feelings . We recall his first meeting with Glenn Curtiss . It was at a banquet celebrating Curtiss ' success as an inventor . Leaning across the table , Barron shouted : " Hello , Mr. Curtiss . How much actual cash did you get out of that deal ? " That was the way Barron was . Dotted Line OUR favorite young man about town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite satisfied with his deportment and steadiness until he was , unfortunately , seriously shaken by something that happened . The clerk had a telegram for him , and asked that he sign a receipt for it . This he prepared to do , adjusting his fountain pen with fine  --  hut not too much  --  care . With complete confidence , he was preparing to affix his name when the clerk said sympatheti " 117 hoots ! Mind Ter bustle , dearie ! " THE NEW YORKER sally , " You do n't really have to sign your name , sir ; just make any kind of mark . " World 's Series BB ASEBALL players in a world 's series participate in the division of the proceeds of the first four games only , because otherwise there might be temptation to prolong the affair and make more money . Or there might he suspicion and speculation on the part of the public , and it is , of course , important that there be none . Members of the clubs finishing second , third , and fourth in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps up their interest after it is evident that they can not win the pennant . The members of the fourth team get about four hundred dollars each . Ten per cent of the total gross receipts are handed over to Commissioner Landis ' office for certain expenses . For example , he pays the umpires , four in number , twenty-five hundred dollars apiece for the series , and he gives each of the three official scorers  --  men selected by the sporting writers from among themselves  --  a thousand dollars each . One incidental item he had to meet this year was reimbursement of the Athletics and the Giants for what it cost them to have tickets printed on the chance that they would participate in the series . All the tickets had to he thrown away , but ordering them was justified on account of the time element . The players on each team always divide their money by vote of the regulars , that is , those who were on the team before June 1 . Those released during the year or hired after June 1 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also true of those who have not played regularly , but in cases like that of Wilccy Moore and Herb Pennock , important pitchers who were out because of injury or illness , full shares are of course granted . Mascots , clubhouse boys , trainers , and so on , are awarded sums by the players , who are usually generous in such matters . They say that the baseball clubs now take firm and honest steps against ticket speculators . A list is kept of all tickets issued in blocks , and agents go around investigating those offered for sale by hawkers . In this way it was found this year that one block of tickets offered at a high price had been sold to a well-known Democratic club . Most of the speculators arc known and tickets are never sold to them . He W ho Hesitates DROPPING a nickel in the turn- stile slot of the downtown " L " at Thirty-third Street , a man stood politely aside to let his companion pass in , when who should rush up and click through the gate but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the platform . The attendant in the change booth , who had seen the swindle , rapped on his window and beckoned the victim to ap-proach . Without comment , he handed him a shiny nickel . We should annotate this somehow , but we are pretty-busy. venturing into the brawling avenues along the North River , got lost immediately , and stumbled into Little W. 12 St. , as the street signs describe it . This thoroughfare is but two blocks long , given over to ducks , celery , and calves for sale , and it leads you to the rim of DeLamater Square , where it expires . DcLamater Square is at the confluence of Tenth and Eleventh Avenues , and is really an esplanade for the three Cunard piers . Probably nobody knows it has so fine a name . It is just called the docks by most people , yet it is almost as broad as the Place de la Concorde . Trucks pound by with cargoes of dressed meats , fittings and valves , Uneeda biscuits , tile , salad dressing , doors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten-ton truck . Tenth and Eleventh Avenues surge toward a lonely little island in the middle of the vast square , divide against a tawdry hotel called the Strand ( a fountain ought to be here ) and go their separate ways . We followed Eleventh Avenue up past the Red Star and the White Star lines to City Plaza which , in case you have never caught the name , is the ugly square between Twenty-second and Twenty-third Streets in front of the Jersey ferries . Wide concrete walks provide easy access to the ferries but ruin the grass . Farther north we dis-covered Thirteenth Avenue . As in the case of DeLamater Square , it is practically un-known . It is the farthest west and the dreariest of these boule-vards exterieurs , and to be arithmetically correct , should he called Twelfth Avenue , because it is but one block west of Eleventh . The pier houses arc small and dismal , their ships sail for points which are not important . Across the streets are gloomy places that were once saloons  --  four or five in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows of the others the old bars may be seen . Thirteenth Avenue staggers north and dies , by drowning , at Twenty-eighth Street . At any rate , for some reason it is flooded here with a foot or more of water . To one side , an old abandoned taxi sat in the flood . Probably an old chauffeur was sprawled over its wheel . We did n't investigate . North of here the avenue becomes a pathway slinking around warehouses and piles of stone until ( we found out on a map later ) it comes out finally in the Forties as Twelfth Avenue , which it should have been called all the time . A Room in a Castle important Hollywood movie di- rector was surveying a duke 's castle which he had caused to be built for a swell drama of royalty , when he noticed that property men had placed a brass cuspidor on the set . It was the one touch not in key . The director spotted it at once . " That 's not a thing to have in a duke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much larger one . " The Orchestras RRIEFLY , the orchestral situation is this : Although the merger of the Philharmonic and Symphony Or-chestras eliminated the succession of guest conductors which the latter so-ciety supported last season , there will be many haton-brandishers on view ? this year . The merged band , known as the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra , will have Willem Mengel-berg and Arturo Toscanini as regular conductors , with occasional appearances by Walter Damrosch and Sir Thomas Beecham . There will be two sets of Children 's Concerts , one directed by Mr. Damrosch , the other by Ernest Schelling , and Mr. Damrosch also will continue the Young People 's Concerts . Entering on its third season , the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Georges Zaslawsky , will branch out into concerts not only in town but also in the New York hinterland . Arthur Honegger is to be guest conductor , but the ambitious Zaslawsky will be in charge of most of the Beethoven 's soirees . There have been announcements of a new Polyphonic Orchestra and of a leaderless ensemble , and perhaps these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most interesting item in the memoranda from visiting orchestras concerns the return of Leopold Stokowski as chief director of the Philadelphia Orchestra . Mr. Stokowski will conduct five concerts here , and do n't believe the story that he will rely exclusively on the standard repertory . He has more novelties than he can shake his stick at , although he always is coy about revealing what they are . The other five Philadelphia subscription concerts are to be led by Ossip Gahrilowitsch , Sir Thomas Beecham , and Clemens Krauss , a new Viennese , who is said to look like Valentino . Mr. Gabrilowitsch also is to appear with his own ensemble from Detroit . There are no changes in the directorate of the other itinerant symphonies . Fritz Reiner continues with the Cincinnati Orchestra , Henri Verbrugghen with Minneapolis , Sergei Kous.5-e vitzky with Boston , and Nikolai Sokoloff with Cleveland . If the Chicago Symphony Orchestra makes good its promise to give a concert here , the conductor will be Frederick Stock , who has led this orchestra nobly for almost twenty years . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Reiner in Cincinnati during Mr. Reiner 's Philadelphia hegira last year , turned up with some orchestra before the end of the season . Except for this newcomer and Mr. Krauss , there seem to be no conductors scheduled who have not already been seen here . There is also a possibility that Eugene Goossens will conduct a few concerts , and perhaps Bernardino Molinari may be heard . Have Faith in Connecticut AS we have observed before , few of the original Connecticut farm people remain on farms in that state , what with the advent of artists and such . One survivor , however , is a Mrs. Whittaker who has lived in her little Dutch farmhouse for forty years . She has never been to New York . THE NEW YORKER 21 Her nearest neighbors are an illustrator and his wife , and recently they had a phone put in . Shortly after this , Mrs. Whittaker , with a shawl about her head , appeared at the door . " I heard you had a telephone put in , " she said . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised but hospitable . She pointed to the instrument , an ordinary desk phone . Mrs. Whittaker studied it a moment in silence . " Well , " she said , " it 's very nice . " With a smile and a nod she Left . Black Gold EVEN the chimney-sweep finds a bright job occasionally . He finds it at least once a year , every autumn , when the fuss of the United States Assay Office in Wail Street are cleaned for the purpose of recovering the gold that is found in the soot . At the assay office the gold is tested in furnaces , and while most of it merely melts , some fine flakes go up the chimney . The sweep  --  after filing a bond of twenty thousand dollars to insure honest and conscientious work  --  collects the soot and turns it over to the officials who refine it . For a decade the government has thus recovered more then ten thousand dollars ' worth of gold annually . Great precautions are taken at this federal office to prevent the waste of gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees of the refining room work in clothes which are never taken from the building and which , when worn out , are burned down for the gold dust they have accumulated . Even the water from the baths is kept until the flakes which have been washed from workers ' hands and hair are recovered . To Get a Drink AN unfailing method of finding a speakeasy in any American city , says a man who gets about the country a lot , is to get into a cab and drive to police headquarters . There is always , he says , one just across the street , a good one . This holds true everywhere except in Jersey City , where one finds seven or eight . Fish Market HE working day begins early at the Fulton Fish Market . Before five in the morning the fishing boats are unloading , although not in as great numbers as in the nineties when Al Smith worked down there , for much of the transporting now is by truck and freight car . Around dawn , however , ships still come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Sisters and Elizabeth Ann . This has an air of romance , but rush of business soon dissipates it . By a quarter to seven the long stalls which sprawl between Beckman and Fulton Streets on the water side of South Street are piled high with fish . Opalescent halibut , gray shrimps , striped bass , are arranged on counters like goods in a department-store basement . An old man deftly sorts lobsters into heaps , according to size ; a fat German fellow cuts slices off a gray log which yesterday was a swordfish . At seven a bell rings and the market is open for business . Buyers hurry in . Men pinch fish as housewives in Third Avenue pinch tomatoes . Fish sellers in long rubber coats call out orders in code : " Y. 0 . T. , " " Fifteen-eighteen , " " Twenty-five blue . " Under the stalls cats wait for scraps . By early afternoon the fish are gone . Men in high boots flood the floors with water , flush out corners , scrub scales from wooden chopping blocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meets you a quarter of a mile up Fulton Street , the market pervades the whole neighborhood . Swarms of smaller markets , its offspring , surround it , but there is only one real Fulton Market , known in full , by the way , as the Wholesale Fulton Market Fishmongers Association . Eighteen companies are members and own stalls which bring a flat purchase price of between forty and fifty thousand dollars each . The association members act as middlemen between the men who bring or ship in the fish , and the retailers . They work on a ten per cent commission basis . Thirty-four years ago , when the Governor worked there , the market was the largest fish-distributing nation in the world . ' - Now it is second to the Boston market . There are still a few fishmongers around who worked with Al Smith . Visitors make a point of seeking them out , but find them laconic fellows . Selling fish makes men silent  --  unless they later go in for more articulate careers . About all Mr. Smith 's old cronies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job well if he gets it , " or " Al 's a good skate . " But they are proud of him . For years he has dropped in occasionally to shake hands . He always looks up William Winant , who is now President of the Fishmongers Association , and who has been in business at the Fulton Fish Market for nearly fifty years . He knew Al when the latter was receiving clerk for the firm of John Feeney , which still occupies stall No. 13 . The market has its elegances . It has offices at the back and some are equipped with chairs and carpets and even tiled baths , and afford a view of the East River which would he worth ten thousand a year if the building were on Beekman Place instead of Beekman Street .
