SIBERIAN GARRISON-Rodion Markovits - Horace Liveright ( $2.50 ) . <P> A young lawyer in Budapest , with a wife and infant child , has just recovered from an illness and is looking for a job when the World War breaks out . He unheroically volunteers ( he has flat feet ) . To his great surprise he is accepted , goes to training camp , then to the front , is captured by the Russians , and , in company with thousands of German and Austrian prisoners , is sent from one prison camp to another , finally landing in Siberia . There , for almost six years , he stays . <P> Rank still counts : this particular camp , in which only officers are allowed , is ruled by the ranking officer with the severe discipline , the stiff etiquette , of the regular army . To pass the time the prisoners write novels , play soundless music on a plank painted like the keyboard of a piano , compose invisible petitions on imaginary typewriters . Amateur theatricals turn the whole camp into a burrow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brest-Litovsk come , the prisoners plan an escape en masse , nearly run into a massacre , are thankful to get back to their safe prison again . As the Revolution and counterrevolution roll across the country , the prison becomes a self-governing community : rank counts for nothing , money everything . Soon a miniature city is in full swing , with industries , entertainments , police , prostitution and crime . The German prisoners , with great patience and ingenuity , forge banknotes . Gradually , long after the War is over , the camp disintegrates ; our hero makes his precarious way home , nearly three years after the Armistice . <P> Author Markovits writes from his own experience : he was taken prisoner by the Russians in 1915 and spent six years in Siberian prison camps . His book , which made little stir on its first publication in Transylvania , was taken up by Budapest critics , is now being published simultaneously in nine countries .
