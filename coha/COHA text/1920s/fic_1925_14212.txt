Public Room in HAWK PEEVEY 's tavern on the road to Nashville in the original state of North Carolina , in the last decade of the eighteenth century . Late afternoon . Late October . The sun shines low through a long window in the rear . A huge chimney staggers into the wall at the right . The main entrance at left ; another at right . To the left , against the wall , a long , heavily built buvette . Some split-bottomed chairs around a circular central table and other chairs and rests scattered around . In the rear a cleated ladder , to the left . The room is white-washed , spacious , and , for the time and place , luxurious . When the curtain rises there are two men at the table , in the center . At the left side sits a HESSIAN ex-soldier , his head buried in his hands . He wears a salt-and-pepper skirted coat with knee smalls , worsted stockings , and shoes without buckles . He has a bullet-shaped head , close-shaven , and wears huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , sits GEORGE DOZIER , a country lawyer , spare , lantern-jawed , forceful , and ominous . There are silver buckles on his shoes and his hair is tied in a rather distinguished cue with black ribbon . He holds a deck of cards in his fingers , riffling them . GEORGE DOZIER Peevey ! He slaps down the cards and turns in his chair . Peevey ! HAWK PEEVEY enters at right. p. 3 HAWK PEEVEY Yo ' obedient , Mister Dozier . DOZIER rises . GEORGE DOZIER That nigger bed my horse down under his forequarters ? HAWK PEEVEY Mr. Dozier , I looked in that stall and I swear the straw was deep enough for a horse to swim in . That nigger had remembered you , sir . GEORGE DOZIER The last time here my mare was found standing with her forefeet on the bare ground at sunrise . A blooded mare , Peevey . At that time I spoke to the nigger . HAWK PEEVEY I hear you did , Mr. Dozier . GEORGE DOZIER I hope it wo n't be necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I shall care for that nigger as if he was my own offspring . GEORGE DOZIER It will be appreciated , Peevey . Moves back of table and sits . HAWK PEEVEY Yes , sir , pacify your mind . DOZIER , his back turned , makes no answer . HAWK , somewhat embarrassed , goes out right . DOZIER riffles the cards . The HESSIAN opposite snores lightly . GEORGE DOZIER to sleeping form.Well . Again the snore . Well . He throws down the cards and rises , walking away from the HESSIAN in disgust . LONNY TUCKER enters quietly from left . He is a boy of twenty , dressed in linsey woolsey without fashion. p. 4 LONNY TUCKER Evenin ' . GEORGE DOZIER turning.Evenin ' . Somewhat constrained , for he and DOZIER have nothing to say to each other . LONNY sits at the table , facing the audience . DOZIER watches him . LONNY picks up the cards . LONNY TUCKER You ai n't been projecking around here lately , Mr. Dozier ? GEORGE DOZIER No , Mr. Tucker , I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOZIER Some are . LONNY TUCKER You spend considerable time at Jonesboro  --  you do ? GEORGE DOZIER Some . A pause . LONNY TUCKER You seen Charity ? GEORGE DOZIER No , and you ? LONNY TUCKER A pause . Then LONNY continues casually . I understand from Charity that her pappy is in favor of her marrying you , Mr. Dozier . GEORGE DOZIER Her father has done me the honor , sir . LONNY TUCKER I can tell you right now , Mr. Dozier you wo n't be able to accept it . p. 5 GEORGE DOZIER Well , boy , we wo n't discuss that . We wo n't discuss it . Turns from LONNY , starts to shuffle cards . LONNY TUCKER She 's not going to marry you . GEORGE DOZIER No ? LONNY TUCKER I have her promise . GEORGE DOZIER We wo n't discuss it . LONNY TUCKER I thought I might warn you , you wo n't have her . You 'll never have her . DOZIER smiles without answering . HAWK comes in from the right . HAWK PEEVEY Evening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAWK stretches out on a bench by the buvette . LONNY rises and goes toward the door , taking his cap . HAWK PEEVEY You ai n't leavin ' already ? LONNY TUCKER I think I 'll step along , Hawk . You tell the Major I 'm sorry I could n't stay . HAWK PEEVEY He sholy will be aggrieved , Lonny . LONNY TUCKER You tell him you reckon I have to go . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT enters , left . He is sixty , tough , fluent , a dean of the frontier courts . He wears a costume of buff and blue , suggesting the Continental regulars , very spotty and soiled , yet with a lingering elegance. p. 6 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Good evening , gentlemen . Dozier , your servant . Mr. Tucker , put down your cap and begin on your gambling education . You come too near being a green man to run away . LONNY TUCKER I ai n't runnin ' away , Major . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Then explain yourself . When I invite a friend to take part in a four-handed whist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him make his excuses before the game starts , sir . LONNY TUCKER If I 'd known Mr. Dozier was to make one , Major MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Sho  --  sho  --  sit down . Mr. Dozier is a gentleman , sir , and a scholar , and his political opinions are ee-dentical with yours . LONNY TUCKER Mr. Dozier and I have a little bad blood between us , Major Singlefoot MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Dozier , what 's between you and this boy ? GEORGE DOZIER A girl , Major . It 's Charity . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT A girl ! Dozier , would you spoil a round of whist over a girl ? GEORGE DOZIER Not I , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Why then , sit down . Sit down , sir . You should know that women are a delusion , while whist is a science . They sit at the table , DOZIER and LONNY in their former places , the MAJOR with his back to the audience . Cards were invented , gentlemen , shortly after Adam was evicted from the gyarden . They were invented by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was about the same time sugar began to turn to alcohol when subjected to the proper environment . As I read history , gentlemen , our corn was not grown until some time after , and the ancients were not initiated into the mysteries of one hundred and thirty proof Carolina dew . I hold it one of the glories of the ancients that despite this deficiency they were able to produce some very remarkable military men . Hawk , how come you ai n't brought that demijohn ? Git up and move around some . p. 7 HAWK PEEVEY rising quickly.Lord , I thought I done brought it . Podden me , gentry . He brings demijohn and places it on floor above MAJOR . There , I reckon that 'll hold you down until moonrise cep'n maybe the Major . I reckon as how the Major has the finest taste for liquor of all the men in this here free State of Franklin . Last year when he stop here on the way to general sessions he drank more liquor than has been drank by any other man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't any more gentry left , Hawk . Nothing but new white folks swarming over the Blue Ridge without a shirt-tail to their names . Takes a hundred years of breeding to up-end a demijohn twenty-five times neat . LONNY TUCKER My grandpappy could drink any man in Fayette County flat of his face in four hours , Major . He sholy admired liquor some . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Who was your grandpap , son ? LONNY TUCKER Nathaniel Tucker , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Not old Nathaniel Tucker of the Second Carolina dragoons ? LONNY TUCKER Sho it was . Killed near Newbarn . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Sho ! Then you got blood in your veins , boy . What you staying in this hollow for ? Cote House is the only place for a blooded man , same as the race track 's the only place for a blooded horse . p. 8 LONNY TUCKER I 'm going to read for the bar next year , sir . GEORGE DOZIER The boy 's in love , Major . He remains here for the same reason that I put up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave off ladies ' names in taverns , Mister Dozier . They is some gentry left . GEORGE DOZIER rising.Look here , young buckskin  --  LONNY TUCKER I ai n't a buckskin ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Gentlemen , gentlemen , the court of love is adjourned . Throw this down into your haslets and praise the Lord that made corn grow on the Cumberland bottoms . He makes a wry face . Hawk , bring me a small noggin of rum to sweeten this here potation . And now , gentlemen , let us get down to the business of the evening , which is whist at a shilling a thousand . To TUCKER . There 'll be plenty of time to adjudicate matters at the shakedown tonight . Unless the custom of fighting at dances has lapsed since I was a young galoot . To DOZIER . Proceed with the deal , sir . He looks at the sleeping HESSIAN . And wake up our bibbling friend from settlements . p. 9 GEORGE DOZIER roughly to HESSIAN , shaking him.Wake up , stranger , and take your cards . Play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I blay anything . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT angry , rising.God Almighty of Gemini ! A stinking Hessian ! He rises . A hired foe of our glorious country ! GEORGE DOZIER Oh , come , Major ! I ai n't filled with admiration either . He 's only selling whale-oil lamps . We had to get a fourth somewheres . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT But this here varmint ! I 'd sooner play cards with George the Third than with this here pole-cat ! A HESSIAN drops cards and looks at MAJOR . Dully . Bole-cat ? Bole-cat ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Sho  --  a pole-cat , and a mighty strong one , right under my nose . I 've a good mind to take my tickler he reaches for a collar holster at the back of his neck and take the scruff off you for presuming to set by me . He draws knife . GEORGE DOZIER Come , Major ! If you skin him he 'll catch cold setting around in his side-meat and bones . And he 's got to play cards , else we don't. p. 10 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT anguished.Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bar.Ai n't any other man in this tavern , gentlemen . Remember you two is late for court at Nashville yourselves . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Hell ! I 'll have to play with him , I guess , the damn Hessian skunk . He puts the knife back in his holster . But I warn you , varmint , I 'm ready to start a dog-fight without the slightest provocation . GEORGE DOZIER Shucks , Major , he fought against the Continental Congress , and you 'll be fighting against it yo'self in a short time , if it 's true what I heard over east . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT What did you hear , sir ? GEORGE DOZIER Back on the settlements they is talk they 've included the Free State of Franklin in the western district of North Carolina , and they 're sending out a state 's attorney to represent the State of North Carolina at Nashville . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT What is your plan , Mister Dozier ? GEORGE DOZIER Major , I reckon we 'll natcherly have to eject this state 's attorney . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Franklin is a sovereign power , separate and distinct from the State of North Carolina , and so far unassimilated into the union of states . Do you hold with me , gentlemen ? p. 11 GEORGE DOZIER I think you can rely on us , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I go further , gentlemen . The Free State of Franklin is not only separate and distinct from every other state , it is also prepared to negotiate with the representatives of other states recognizing its independence , and to all other states not recognizing its aforesaid independence , it is prepared to issue defiance and defend itself by force of arms from foreign aggression . Decisively to TUCKER , after pause . Mr. Tucker , I play cards with no man whose views on that subject fail to accord with my own . Are you with us , sir ? LONNY TUCKER Certainly , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT to the HESSIAN.And you , sir ? A pause . GEORGE DOZIER It 's quite possible the gentleman is unaware of the issue , Major . However , he has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's likely he 'd be willing to do it again . The point is , sir to the HESSIANwould you fight to maintain the Free State of Franklin ? A HESSIAN Fight ? I fight anything . GEORGE DOZIER I reckon that 'll have to do , Major . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT It is my plan to publish this approaching state 's attorney , publish him on the threshold o ' the courthouse at Nashville , and to issue him cartel and defiance , offering him the satisfaction that a gentleman o ' one political faith affo'ds a gentleman holding an opposite one . p. 12 GEORGE DOZIER Major , I had planned to reserve the privilege fo ' myself . I had planned to do it befo ' he gits to Nashville . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT It may be that they are sending a man whose prudence exceeds his sense o ' honor . I figger it will take a heap o ' contumely to bring him to the straights o ' the code duello . GEORGE DOZIER You are too polite , Major . I reckon I 'll either kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not being licensed to practice before the Carolina bar , I do n't think he 'd be obliged to meet me with pistols if he ever gits to Nashville . Moreover , if he gits there the Free State will be done . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I reckon , then , he never will git there . Seating himself ; he fingers his knife-holster . So they delegate us a prosecuting attorney for the western district of North Carolina , do they ? Gentlemen , it will be a pleasure to see him fleeing these parts with his hair flattened in the wind and his saddle bags scattering legal information all along the Nolhichucky Trace . A HESSIAN interested.Vot is it you say ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I say no treason , sir , no treason . A HESSIAN rising.I have no treason . p. 13 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Set still , Adolph , set still . And play . A HESSIAN I set still . GEORGE DOZIER pushing cards forward.It 's your play , Major . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT My honor , sir . They cut . The MAJOR deals , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MAJOR as he stoops to pick them up . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT settling down his mug angrily.Stranger , lower your elbow or I 'll have the haslet out of you real soon . HESSIAN lowers elbow . HAWK PEEVEY Do n't bother his haslet , Major . I spent a sight of time last Fourth of July cleaning up folks ' haslets that was left around . We had thirty-four fighters to the cross-roads for the speakin ' besides the speakers . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT If he fools with me I 'll have his liver out and make him clean up after it . He turns to HAWK . Give me a plug of navy and bring a wide gobboon . I 'm a tolerably inaccurate spitter after six potations . LONNY TUCKER We are waiting for you to play , Major , please , sir . They play one-half through hand. p. 14 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT playing.Beat that , varmint . A HESSIAN playing.Dray of Tiamonds . They finish hand . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Hawk , is there big planning for the soire tonight at Wes Bibbs ' barn ? LONNY TUCKER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na be there too . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Which one of you gentlemen is escorting Miss Charity ? LONNY TUCKER I am , sir . GEORGE DOZIER You think so , boy . LONNY TUCKER I am ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Gentlemen , gentlemen , you know you two remind me of a story I heard from a feller who stood up with Dan'l Boone at the Colonel 's wedding . He knew Dan'l when Dan'l was courting his bride-to-be . I never hearn the beat of it . ' Pears like Dan'l come to the settlement just like you two pointing to DOZIER and LONNYcome here tonight after the same girl , to attend a harvest soire and ask her ma for her hand . Dan'l was n't so well known at this settlement where he come , being only a tolerable young galoot about seven feet high , which was n't even middling tall for the buckskins along the Tennessee River in them days . Of course he 'd been biting the heads off b'ars and catamounts in his own hollow HESSIAN raises elbow , but his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a high elbow in the MAJOR 'S face . Stranger , lower your elbow , else I 'll claw your jugular . He lowers elbow . So Dan'l hearn tell of the puttiest gal in the Tennessee country , daughter of a widow woman who owned her own cabin and who ' lowed that the galoot who got her darter would just naturally be powerful enough provider to cut a winter 's supply of firewood with his eye teeth . Well , sirs , Dan'l always was powerful minded to start out and see anything he knowed was there , and he set out for this here gal . He started off loping along to where this paragon of Venus lived . She was sixteen years old and was fat as a butter ball and pink as a haw bush in spring . Dan'l started loping along chomping his eye teeth and wishing to God he was bigger for his size . Pretty soon , he come to the clearing . Well , sirs , this clearing was as plumb full of suitors as Penelope 's house in the Odyssey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , each one wearing a live racoon for a cap and not speaking to nobody under their size . Now Dan'l had n't been unmindful of the first impression women folks gets of their men , and he was leading a three-hundred-pound panther by a string as a sort of little present for this gal . But his spirits sank when he see the sight of powerful men in the yard before the door . They was a red-headed fellow sixteen hands high setting on the stoop talking to the darter and letting a pet rattlesnake suck on his thumb . DOZIER and LONNY laugh ; the MAJOR takes a chew of tobacco and a drink on top of it . So Dan'l slunk around the house to set and chew grass for a spell and think up something , and God Almighty , he beheld two Georgia crackers entered in the race . They were cutting firewood like beavers , and one of them had lost his teeth fighting his way north and he was gumming the damned oak wood into three foot lengths . Dan'l was down-hearted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT discharging his quid . To HESSIAN , reaching wrathfully toward his collar.Stranger , you 're going to lose that elbow . HAWK PEEVEY who has wandered to the window.One moment , gentlemen . There 's a man on horseback coming west , followed by a nigger on a mule and leading a bay mare . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT to HESSIAN.Would you condescend to inform me , sir , whether your interior framework is so constructed that you can not fold your flippers down to your ribs or whether it will be necessary to operate sir . NIGGER to HAWK.Cap'n Jackson , suh , say if he mek Tooly Hill by nightfall . HAWK PEEVEY Nigger , tell him it 's seven miles and a hard ride and a harder bed in the blockhouse which he will git to , if the redskins let him get to it . Tell him we do n't ride no further without scouts and hunters . NIGGER Den Cap'n Jackson , he stay here den , suh . He got racing mare , spo'ting dog and two fighting chickens to board . HAWK PEEVEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SINGLEFOOT to NIGGER , who starts to go.One minute , nigger , who is your master ? A Port Royal Jackson ? p. 16 NIGGER pausing in door.Naw , sir . We 's Salisbury Jacksons . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Salisbury Jacksons ? I never heard tell of Jacksons in Salisbury . NIGGER Well , you'se gwine to now , Marse General . Us is the biggest hearn-tell-uns in No'th Ca'lina . Us is de one and only Cap'n Jackson . De one an ' only . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT as NIGGER goes out and HAWK starts to follow.Hawk , before you leave to attend on the arrival of this unique Jackson and his sporting menagerie , would you step around and bring me another noggin of rum ? HAWK brings the rum . The importation of aristocracy is a rare occasion , but a Salisbury Jackson is not a Port Royal Jackson , and in the opinion of this here court you need not fluster yourself . HAWK PEEVEY No , sir , Major . I ' low I wo n't allow myself to be flustered . He goes out , right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SINGLEFOOT Sho , now , I was embarked on a narrative . I was indeed . I had merely paused , sir , until it became fairly certain that we should have no further interruptions . The NIGGER enters left , carrying saddle and saddle-bags , which he sets down near the rear wall . He goes out left . HAWK enters immediately , carrying a long black duelling case and followed by ANDY JACKSON , about twenty years old , slight , tall , fiery , dressed in light blue , rather soiled , but smart , his red hair tied in a queue with a small black string. p. 17 HAWK PEEVEY I 'll set it right here , Cap'n . And what can I get for you ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON hardly glancing at the card table.Give me a glass of whiskey , host . A double glass of your finest . HAWK PEEVEY Yessir , Cap'n . He serves the whiskey . GEORGE DOZIER to LONNY , who has drawn in a hand.Are we to understand by that action , Mr. Tucker , that you labor under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture that last trick which you have under your hand ? LONNY TUCKER Oh , I beg pardon , gentlemen , my mistake ! He pushes the hand back . DOZIER takes it . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON What village is this , host ? HAWK PEEVEY Some say it 's Peevey Hill on the hill , Cap'n , and some say it 's Peevey Bottom on the bottom . It do n't make no difference to me . My name 's Peevey . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON seizing his glass.You are near Nashville ? HAWK PEEVEY A hundred thirty miles , as the crow flies , Cap'n , and some extra , up and down , dodging the Injuns. p. 18 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON It 's rather dull here , no doubt , by contrast with social life at Nashville . HAWK PEEVEY Lord ! a sight dull , a sight dull . A body do n't get no entertainment here to compare , sir . Now Nashville , there 's a town that 's gay , sir . A sight of people there . Eight hundred if there 's a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card.Now , as I was saying , gentlemen , in regard to Dan'l , he was considerable tuckered and set still for quite a spell , ruminating in his mind . And the longer he set there the tougher that there oak wood looked to him . HESSIAN raises elbow . It was an entire winter 's supply for a seven-foot opening . Pause . To HESSIAN . God damn you , keep your elbow out of my eye ! But Dan'l made up his mind he 'd have to learn to chew it , because he was n't a man to give up easy , and so he sauntered over , and set his teeth into a joint of dogwood just to try it , and the very first gnaw convinced him he 'd have to cogitate on something else to do . So he edged away , casual like . Nevertheless those two Georgia Crackers bust out laughing fit to kill themselves . At that Dan'l 's temper kind of give way and he ventured to them Crackers that they would probably live only a short time to regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a very brief interval . Well , sirs , they failed to moderate in time , and Dan'l waded into them with his bare hands and began to start a little flurry in the back yard . Now they was n't critters themselves , and right soon you 'd ' a ' thought from the trampling and confusion that maybe a thousand men had got into trouble with each other in that there rear acreage . The widow woman and her darter come running around the corner of the house and what they see was a pillar of dust a half mile high going round like a cyclone , all mixed up with firewood and bare feet and occasional breech-clouts busted loose from the human form . Well , sirs , it was some time before it quieted down in that region , what with the b'ar dogs barking and the turkeys running and all like that , and when the dust begun to settle , the onlookers caught sight of one of them crackers ninety foot up on a dead limb of a rhododendron tree hanging by a endpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them from half-way across the Tennessee River , which he had been fortunate enough to descend into . LONNY and DOZIER laugh . There ! eighteen cords of firewood tromped plumb into kindling , and Dan'l was standing there , still holding his panther by his string . He was nigh onto a foot taller than he was when he arrived , having growed that much from the exercise . There is them that say he got his full growth on that occasion and never did grow no more . He drinks. p. 19 LONNY TUCKER I reckon he got the lady , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT She has since borne him fourteen men-children , sir . The door at the right opens and CHARITY CLARKSON slips in , perfectly at ease in the company of so many men . She is a slight girl of fifteen dressed in linsy-woolsy . By God , we were men in them days . GEORGE DOZIER seeing CHARITY and rising in his place.A pleasure to see ye , Miss Charity . All rise except HESSIAN . CHARITY . My pleasure , Mr. Dozier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charity . CHARITY CLARKSON Evening , Lonny . DOZIER resumes his seat . MAJOR . I beg your pardon , ma'am , for indulging in the sin of blasphemy in your presence . CHARITY CLARKSON Lawd ! Major Singlefoot , I do n't mind none . It ai n't a sight to pappy when he works half the night borning a calf , and it comes a bull . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Let us hope that is not because your ears have become accustomed to the rude talk of vigorous men , Miss Charity , but because your kind heart finds special clemency for my transgression , ma'am . LONNY sits down. p. 20 CHARITY CLARKSON ending the matter.Major , how you do run on . HAWK PEEVEY Is your mammy sent you for that sugar loaf , Miss Charity ? CHARITY CLARKSON Yes , Mr. Peevey , she says she ca n't pay but for half of it today . She shows a shilling . HAWK PEEVEY The card game sits . Lord , that 's all right , child . He is breaking up something behind the bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of it today , and keep the rest for her . CHARITY CLARKSON But she 'll need it all , Mr. Peevey , if she gets my snack ready for the soire tonight . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON to HAWK , ominously.Surely , host , you can not think of sending half . HAWK PEEVEY Cap'n , I sho ' could n't . Cap'n , I just could n't . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON A loaf is a powerful lot of sugar for one who seems sweet enough in her natural self . CHARITY CLARKSON curtsying.You seem to have caught your tongue from the Major , Cap'n . GEORGE DOZIER rising , pushing his chair.I do not know you , sir . p. 21 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Captain Jackson , sir , of North Carolina . GEORGE DOZIER I repeat , I do not know you , sir , nor do I care for your impudence . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON turning back on DOZIER.It affords me no regrets , sir . GEORGE DOZIER Miss Charity , I hope it is not your custom to meet the tavern loungers as they arrive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARITY.It would appear that when there are errands to be run to the tavern yo ' mother might find a child to run them , Miss Charity . CHARITY CLARKSON jolted and frightened.I came to get a sugar loaf , Mr. Dozier . Mammy wanted to surprise you with a sugar cake when you called for me tonight . LONNY TUCKER rising.Charity , are you going to the soire with him , after all ? CHARITY CLARKSON Yes , Lonny . LONNY TUCKER You promised me . CHARITY CLARKSON I know I did . A pause . LONNY and DOZIER look at each other. p. 22 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Sit down , gentlemen , sit down . I ai n't set at such a restless card table since the flea season . DOZIER and LONNY seat themselves , DOZIER first . HAWK PEEVEY still busy under the bar.Ef you will wait , Miss Charity , I 'll git a paper to wrap up the sugar . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON sipping whiskey.You say you find it dull here , Mr. Peevey ? HAWK PEEVEY A sight dull , Cap'n , a sight dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more than one hundred thirty miles from the metropolis of western North Carolina , Mr. Peevey . Most disappointing , I vow . The table stops playing and listens . HAWK PEEVEY low , to CAP'N.Bless your stars , Cap'n , do n't say North Carolina . It ai n't done around here . A body might get kilt for that . We are the Free State of Franklin . We ai n't in the union . We 's a sovrain power . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You do n't say , sir , you do n't say ! HAWK PEEVEY Anybody 'd know you was a stranger round here , or you would sho'ly know that , Cap'n . Now , Miss Charity , if you 'll wait just one moment . He climbs to the loft . There is a brief silence , a hand playing out rapidly at the table . HAWK is half-way down the ladder as the HESSIAN starts to deal , his elbow in the MAJOR 'S eye . The MAJOR roars , draws his knife and wounds him slightly . The HESIAN screams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinks to the left door. p. 23 HAWK PEEVEY dropping his paper and running to the HESSIAN.Gentlemen , gentlemen ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT By God , you 'd better grovel . HAWK PEEVEY Aw , why did n't you keep out of the Major 's way ? He lifts the HESSIAN , walks him to right door and pushes him out . You ai n't fitten company for gentlemen . They go out . Pause . LONNY TUCKER Charity , may I fetch you home on my pillion ? Enter . PEEVEY , stops at lower corner of bar . CHARITY CLARKSON No , no ! Mr. Peevey , could I have my sugar ? HAWK PEEVEY I 'm getting it , Miss Charity . I 'm getting it . He picks up paper and goes behind counter . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Ma'am , for the second time I submit my deepest apologies . I am most extravagantly sorry . CHARITY CLARKSON Lawd , fightin ' ai n't no offense , Major ! But ai n't the man bleeding now ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Ma'am , you do n't want to worry about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt at all , to speak of . It saves him the leech 's fee . To JACKSON . Cap'n Jackson , I believe you said , sir . p. 24 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON bowing.Your devoted , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I am Major Singlefoot , formerly of South Carolina , now of the Free State of Franklin , Cap'n Jackson . This is Mister Tucker of hereabouts . And this gentleman is George Dozier , Esquire , one of the leading legal lights o ' this sovereign region . It happens that an untoward accident has deprived us of our fourth at cards , Cap'n Jackson . Air you disposed to join us at this juncture , sir ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Why , sir , I had promised myself that I would not tetch cards until I reached Nashville . It falls out most unlucky , I am sure . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT And you will not reconsider ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I fear not , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT flustered , a little sullen.Indeed , sir . GEORGE DOZIER sits back of table . Oh , come , Major , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ! Mister Peevey , you have a little whist , I believe . HAWK PEEVEY back of bar.Mister Dozier , the host do n't never submerge himself that-a-way . Not that I ai n't itchin ' to sit in , gentlemen , only I am obliged to make that there rule , having gone completely bankrupt back in the settlements no less than two times . I just naturally has to refrain , sir . p. 25 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I will join with you , after all . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT pleased.Sit down , Cap'n , sit down . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON And will you liquor with me , gentlemen ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Instantly , sir . LONNY TUCKER With pleasure , sir . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON to DOZIER.And you , sir , how do you feel about it ? GEORGE DOZIER snarling and snapping his fingers.I do n't feel that about it , not that ! Play or not . I can care for myself . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Thank you , sir . He sits in the HESSIAN 'S place , takes up the cards to deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HAWK brings another jug . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Will you deal , Cap'n ? After pause . Cap'n , are you aware that you are courting death by your antics ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON To what antics do you refer , sir ?

You shall have to put up with it as best you can . p. 26 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT rising . DOZIER and LONNY rise.You are a Jackson from Salisbury , I believe , sir ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Your memory is excellent for names , Major . Captain Jackson , sir , of Salisbury . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT reaching for his knife.I was not aware that there were Jacksons in Salisbury , sir , but it is easy to see , sir , that if there are Jacksons in Salisbury , they lack manners . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON A Jackson from Salisbury 's too much of a gentleman to use a knife , sir . I believe they use other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON rising.That I am ready , sir , to give any gentleman satisfaction to DOZIERwho cares to meet me . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT rising.Hawk , get them pistols out of my saddle-bags and load ' em with ball . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I have a pair ready loaded in my case , sir . LONNY TUCKER Gentlemen , gentlemen , this is entirely unnecessary . Strolls upstage. p. 27 HAWK PEEVEY Yes , gentlemen , for God 's sake do n't start no killing on a night like this . If you start killing one another it 'll spread till there wo n't be no dance at all . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT to JACKSON.It is one of the peculiarities of our neighborhood , sir , that such is very probably the case . HAWK PEEVEY It would sho'ly be inconvenient , gentlemen . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT But I should be loath for to give any man cause to believe I was in the habit of postponing such engagements , sir . I positively hasten them , sir . HAWK PEEVEY Furthermore , gentlemen , it 's after sundown and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Mister Peevey , you will kindly remove yourself ? Captain Jackson , there will be a harvest moon . I am at your service either at moonrise or at sunrise . My hesitation in this affair is due solely to a wish not to interfere with later festivities of the evening . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON bowing to CHARITY.I , too , should grieve if this young female lost her jig . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Why , then , that being the case , I 'd as lief kill you at sunrise as at moonrise . ' Pears to me like you are spoiling for a fight right now , but if you 'll keep until dawn I can bide my time to teach you manners in the Free State of Franklin . p. 28 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Then shall we say sunrise , sir ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Sunrise , sir , and most happy , sir . GEORGE DOZIER pause.Major , I shall be glad to serve you in this matter . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Thank you , Mister Dozier . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON And will you act for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOZIER to LONNY.Look here , boy . You do n't want to serve with every blackguard that traipses into a tavern trying to get a reputation on his marksmanship . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Sir , I hope you will not be swerved from an act of chivalrous generosity by the advice of some blackleg lawyer of the trumpery State of Franklin . GEORGE DOZIER You must fight me for this . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON turning to DOZIER.Sir , I had a mind to kill you when you rebuked this young lady so rudely . GEORGE DOZIER We need not wait five minutes longer . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT One moment , Mister Dozier , sir . I believe I have the prior claim on the young blood 's attention . He is not to fight me till dawn , sir , and you must postpone further adjudication till a clean sunrise . p. 29 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON to DOZIER.You are to be the young lady 's escort , I believe , and even the pleasure of spitting your black heart is not first in this affair . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT half amused , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since you figure on surviving to meet another . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Sir , you are a veteran and a duelist ; I should take it most courteous of you if you could be prevailed upon to yield this gentleman first place on my list . For I must kill him , even though I stand dying from your wound . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT drinking and reflecting.Well , now , sir , I got to think it over some . I 'd admire to reserve for myself the pleasure of challenging the new prosecuting attorney the Governor of North Carolina is sending out here to the Free State of Franklin , and it 's possible if I was first on your list I might not be able to kill him the hour of his arrival . Yes , sir , thinking it over , I do n't want to be no hog . If Mister Dozier agrees to give me first shot at the prosecuting attorney I 'm free to say he can have first shot at you , sir . GEORGE DOZIER Done , sir . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair can not be so simply arranged , as I happen to be the newly empowered prosecuting attorney for the western district of North Carolina . They step back from him. p. 30 GEORGE DOZIER No ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Did I hear you rightly , sir ? Did you say you are the new state 's attorney ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I am , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT raising his glass.Providence is indeed gracious to me . Mister Dozier , I withdraw my resignation . I shall insist on meeting the Cap'n first . GEORGE DOZIER You have the right . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT And I may tell you , Cap'n Jackson , that my feelings toward you have undergone a sudden and I may say a revolutionary change . Before this announcement was read into the record , sir , I was inclined to admire your carriage and even to regret that so young a man was so unlikely to finish his first journey to Nashville . I was inclined to wish you a rapid recovery from your two wounds , and subsequent to that a long and more cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attorney , sir , and a representative of a foreign government , I shall find it necessary to kill you , sir , and it is my hope and belief that I shall do the same for every prosecuting attorney the State of North Carolina sends into this free and sovereign region . It is my intention to lay them out one by one , sir , as fast as they are sent , sir , until the State of North Carolina gets completely tired of sending prosecuting attorneys in this direction , sir . p. 31 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Your sentiments , sir , and those of your friends are well known in the state I represent ; and it may be that the office I hold has gone begging for some time on account of a certain timidity felt by some barristers more learned than patriotic . That timidity , sir , I did not share . I do not share it now . I abhor your sentiments , sir , but I admire you , sir , and I am only sorry that your political views must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sir . Your devoted . They bow . Mr. Dozier , shall we stroll up to the corners and take squinting practice a few times ? Your silhouette is a trifle thicker than the Cap'n 's , but ' twill serve . DOZIER and the MAJOR take their saddle-bags and go out , left . HAWK PEEVEY Miss Charity , your sugar is ready . Sorry you had to wait . He hands her the package . CHARITY CLARKSON It was a treat , Mister Peevey . I do love to see a quarrel . LONNY TUCKER It 's getting late , Charity . May I walk with you ? CHARITY CLARKSON opening right door.It 's only a mile . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Mister Tucker , I hope you will convey to Miss Charity my regret that this episode should have occasioned her annoyance. p. 32 LONNY TUCKER Cap'n Jackson wishes to say CHARITY CLARKSON cutting in.It ai n't no matter at all , Captain Jackson . Please do n't hurt the gentlemen none . Lingering . To JACKSON . Good night sir . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of the sugar cake at the soire ? CHARITY CLARKSON gravely . If you air mean enough to come you may surely have some , sir , and very welcome . She goes out . The MAJOR opens the left door and looks in . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Hawk , that there varmint of a Hessian is sleeping like a wooden image under your signpost , and I reckon you better lay him in the barn before he ruins your trade . HAWK PEEVEY Yes , sir . Thank you , Major . The MAJOR disappears . Mister Tucker , would you give me a hand with him ? LONNY TUCKER Surely . Captain Jackson , if I am to act for you , we shall want a few minutes ' conversation , I believe . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON If you should like to reconsider acting for me , Mister Tucker , why , I should wish to leave you entirely free . p. 33 LONNY TUCKER I am bound , Captain . Moreover , I 'll be happy . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You place me under deep obligation , Mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONNY and HAWK go out left . JACKSON , left alone , opens the dueling case and begins methodically to adjust a flint . The door at the left opens slowly , and CHARITY looks in . She still carries her package of sugar . JACKSON , seeing her , rises . For a moment they do not speak . CHARITY CLARKSON Mister Peevey is  --  Mister Peevey has gone out , Captain ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON They have stepped out for a minute , ma'am . Would you wish me to call Mister Peevey ? CHARITY CLARKSON It was only  --  No , I 'd rather not . She closes the door behind her . She comes a step forward . I wanted to warn you if you do n't mind , sir CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You tetch me , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON You do n't know us here none , Captain . We are buckskin in the Free State , and you do n't know us . The Major is always dueling , and so is Mister Dozier . Mister Dozier is the worst . They have killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' men , Captain . p. 34 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Yes , ma'am , I 'm sure they are . CHARITY CLARKSON They mean to kill you , I 'm sure of that . You are mighty young and pretty to be kilt here , so far from your pappy 's house . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON bowing.You will never know how grateful I am , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON with terror and admiration.You ai n't running away , really , Cap'n ? Ai n't it true about red-headed men ? So little and no beard at all , and picking fights a'ready like a bear dog . Picking ' em with anybody at all . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON gallantly.Only , ma'am , with those who do not seem to serve you well . With that Dozier , for example . CHARITY CLARKSON anxious.Cap'n , I 'd admire to see you fight him , I would that . But they 's two on your back . You 'd better hit the trace . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON pompously.Shortly after sunrise , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON dropping the latch and returning slowly.You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON terribly swanky.I 'm much more likely to do the inflicting , ma'am . If you knew me better you would warn Mister Dozier against me . I 've seen trouble some . p. 35 CHARITY CLARKSON You air mighty young and foolish . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I 'm old enough to be a cap'n , ma'am . I was through the war , and a prisoner to the redcoats at fourteen . I 've seen a sight of men die . CHARITY CLARKSON Lonny is twenty . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Indeed , ma'am . It is none too young to enjoy your society . CHARITY CLARKSON Air you too old , Cap'n ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Almost , ma'am , unless you are as charitable as yo ' name . CHARITY CLARKSON Lonny is a fool boy , Cap'n . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON He do n't know the hell that 's in men , ma'am . He has never had to fight for his place and eat the crumbs from the table o ' the gentry . And yet you love him a sight , I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mister Dozier , Cap'n , when he comes home . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON No , he 's not , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON You aim to shoot Mister Dozier ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Not if you 'd rather he killed me , ma'am . p. 36 CHARITY CLARKSON I would n't . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Then he wo n't . CHARITY CLARKSON Please do n't kill him , Cap'n . It ai n't Christian . You 're too young and pretty to go around killing men . Please hide until morning , and then hit the trace , Cap'n . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON But I must dance a reel with you about moondown . CHARITY CLARKSON Do you mean it , Cap'n ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Will you give me that blossom in yo ' smock as a gage ? CHARITY CLARKSON taking a laurel blossom.Law , Cap'n , a body would think you meant to come ! She hears voices and turns from him . Looks enigmatically at him , curiously , without smiling . She goes out . JACKSON puts the blossom in his pocket carelessly and begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters . HAWK PEEVEY comes up and observes the pistols.Cap'n , you are smart to carry them things around , if you aim to represent the old North State here . You 'll need ' em a sight o ' times befo ' you are done . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON playing with pistols all the time.A bold front 's half the battle . I 'll only need them once or twice . p. 37 HAWK PEEVEY You reely aim to meet these two ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON How can I avoid it ? HAWK PEEVEY Lots o ' ways , Cap'n . Go on back to Jonesboro . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Sir , I am on my way to Nashville . HAWK PEEVEY No offense , sir . I 'm for you . I ai n't for this here Free State . A tavern keeper knows that unless gentry run a thing , it do n't run . And George Dozier 's no gentry . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Does he aim to run his own state ? HAWK PEEVEY That he does . He and the Major . He 'll end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well know how things stand . There 'll be a sight o ' enemies here , and you 'll be lucky to leave while you can . You better go back and bring mo ' on your side befo ' you tackle George Dozier in his own neck o ' the woods . Mind you , I ai n't ag'in you . I 'm for you . I kai n't run this tavern without yo ' kind o ' patrons . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON looking at pistols.If you are for me , show me the way to the dancing tonight . HAWK PEEVEY Cap'n , I 'd rather drop you into a barrel full of hot spittin ' wildcats . They 'll be buckskins there from four rivers and three mountain ranges . They 'll be carryin ' a thirst they been nursin ' all summer long , and if they see you , Cap'n , you wo n't have to bother about no duelin ' in the morning . p. 38 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Peevey , all I ask of them buckskins is that they wait until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Cap'n , is it your desire to squint down your barrels a few times ? I kin light candles if you care to keep your skill with them a secret . I can tell you those two gentlemen are the clostest-shooting gentlemen in the Free State of Franklin . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Bring the candles , host . I 'll try two shots . HAWK PEEVEY reaching under the bar.Lord , it 's real unnatural . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON turning below table. What is , sir ? HAWK PEEVEY These two tapers . One fat and one lean , like your opponents . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Place them in the window , host . HAWK steps on bench , places candles , lights them , and goes behind bar . Is there likely to be any one passing outside ? HAWK PEEVEY Lord , no ! It 's a log wall behind . You ca n't hurt it none . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON showing HAWK two pistols.Major , I shall only dust your coat . He fires , and the fat candle flickers , but still flames . Mister Dozier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Free State of Franklin . The thin candle is out instantly. @x Time : moonrise. 2 A.M. Cleared ground in front of WES BIBB 'S new log barn , which curtains the back-stage , with small door right which is wide open . Through the chinks may be discerned the color and movement of dancers , also the woodsmoke from fat-pine torches . The stage is bare , save for three stumps . To right a dried cornfield , and at one point stalks trussed into a seat . To left is a forest , unbroken save for a helterskelter path leading off . Moonlight through forest . For a few minutes the only movement is the shadows of dancers , and the squeak of one very bad fiddle is heard . The shouts of the fiddler are audible , and so is the stamp of dancers ' feet and the occasional whoops of the more antic dancers . His calls , about thirty seconds apart , are as follows:Eight hands up and go forward , Half and back ; Partners : Sash-i-ate . Gentlemen stand and ladies swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash-i-ate . All hands up and go to the left ; Hit the floor ; Corner turn ; and sash-i-ate . First couple cage the bird with three arms around ; Bird hop out and hoot-owl in ; Three arms around and hootin ' again . As the music dies momentarily ( and it will be resumed again whenever the barn is filled with people to the accompanying , though softer calls of the fiddler ) three men burst steaming from the side doorway and come quickly to the array of jugs and horns upon stumps and crude settles near the piled cornstalks . They are MAJOR SINGLEFOOT , as of Act I precisely ; WES BIBB , a big , bearded giant of a pioneer farmer in linsy-woolsy , boots , and antique wig ; and HAIRY LAKE , a picture of the frontiersman of the late eighteenth century , in full buckskin , worn soft and dark and fitting , with a fine coonskin cap , and dark moccasins casing the ends of his buckskin breeches , leather girdle with knife and tomahawk on right side , powder-horn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he moves ) a long , flintlock rifle of small bore . Nothing about him gleams . His hair is hacked off as it hits his shoulders , and he has a marvelous hacked beard . He is about forty , and a giant . He is never still and continually wears the inquisitive nose and poised ear of a fine hound . WES and the MAJOR flop down instantly , but HAIRY moves to the jugs . HAIRY LAKE grasping a jug.Your jug , Wes ? p. 41 WES BIBB My jug , Hairy . HAIRY LAKE having already poured three , hands one to WES and offers the other to the MAJOR . Music fades and dancers exit to left . Faint laughter . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT nobly protesting.Gentlemen , gentlemen , with that last noggin emptied , I had quit the field . HAIRY LAKE anxious.Hell , Major , air yo ' bowels weakening ? So soon , Major ? WES BIBB Why , Major , you ai n't half under ! No , not half . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT But , gentlemen , I 'm to kill another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' distillate is a powerful burden upon a marksman .

HAIRY LAKE Met redskins twice . WES BIBB He did . Sho . He did . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT sighing.I have to hoist one more with ye , p. 42 HAIRY LAKE Laugh , off left . WES BIBB You will . Sho . You will . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT But it will founder me , as surely as the devil made little Injuns . I 'll have to , though , in memory of King 's Mountain . WES BIBB And who 'll we drink to , Major ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Sho now , we 'll drink to the Father o ' his country , victor o ' Yorktown , woodman , hunter , and military marvel o ' the ages . His excellency , General George Washington , President of the United States . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink to a man , Major , when you name him with such a ruffle . WES BIBB The Major are a mocking-bird , sho . HAIRY LAKE But it air unfair to General Greene , not to have the Major name him . WES BIBB We 'll drink to him , sho ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT General Greene were a ree-markable soldier , my friends . HAIRY LAKE And deservin ' of a ruffle , Major . I have clasped his hand on the field , sir . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I believe he felicitated you on yo ' marksmanship , after the battle . p. 43 WES BIBB Sho . Fill ' em up again , Hairy . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT as HAIRY sets about the jug.I must decline , gentlemen , though not from disrespect , fo ' I served with distinction in General Greene 's long rifles in the same engagement . HAIRY LAKE God a'mighty , an ' you wo n't drink to him ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Well , we might wet the bottom of our throats to him , a sort o ' salutin ' piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im , Major , name ' im . He holds his head with appreciative gusto as the MAJOR proposes the toast . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT To a soldier who never left the enemy upon the field , who purged the South o ' the Tories and hirelings of that despot George the Third , who endured the hardships of his troops with the joy that a babe knows when sleeping on his mother 's breast to that scourge o ' traitors and peer o ' freemen  --   --  HAIRY LAKE Name him , name him ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT General Nathanael Greene of Savannah . They drink . HAIRY LAKE Hear ! All drink . Why , Major , when you set here and name ' em , I feel as if I could stand to and bibble a horn to every man in the armies o ' the Congress . p. 44 WES BIBB We could . Sho . We could . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I have always deemed it unwise , my friends , to drink more than one toast ; for the heart grows larger under the mellowing influence o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind . WES BIBB Who are it now , Major ? HAIRY LAKE moving to the jugs again.Name ' im , name ' im . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT continuing his revery.And so the heart is more capacious than the bowels . How could we drink to that pearl of the live-oaks , General Marion , the swamp-fox , and yet disregard the claims o ' the brilliant and dashing Pulaski ? Or how could we pass over the name of Lafayette , young markee of France , Major-General o ' continental line at the tender age of nineteen , and son in arms to our illustrious commander ? Or to Lighthorse Harry Lee , prince o ' horsemen from the Old Dominion , and sweet flower o ' Virginia 's gentry ? HAIRY LAKE passing the cup.Lord , Major , but ye excite me Music starts . People begin to filter into the barn , dancing. and my head gets to drummin ' . Name one , fo ' God 's sake , name one ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I give you one , my friends . He stands up . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude of our country ; a man whose melodious name quiets children at their mother 's knee , who has dared the trackless wilderness , known the rivers , fields and streams , who has slain where none others ever chanced to look upon , peerless rifleman and hunter , as gentle as a dove , brave as a lion , hardy as the eagle o ' the crags moreover , a man who 's a close personal friend o ' mine p. 45 HAIRY LAKE screaming.Name ' im ! Name ' im ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Colonel Daniel Boone o ' Boonesboro . Bottoms up desperately . As they finish the toast , DOZIER and CHARITY Come out . He is holding her arm . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT seeing them and evidently clearing the ground.After which name , gentlemen , it were sacrilege to wet our pipes again . Having toasted glory , shall we repair to the hall and pay our devoir to beauty ? Long pause . WES BIBB We will . Sho . We will . Exit the three . GEORGE DOZIER Charity , want to dance ? CHARITY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go to Nashville , Charity , you 'll be going there with me . CHARITY CLARKSON There 's a sight o ' people there , Dozier . GEORGE DOZIER But none like you , Charity . You will surely queen it in Nashville . CHARITY CLARKSON I reckon you 're a mighty big man at Nashville . GEORGE DOZIER I 'm going to be bigger , Charity . I 'm going to run the country in my time . p. 46 CHARITY CLARKSON If you figure on running things you wo n't be dueling that little gentleman from the tavern . GEORGE DOZIER And why not ? I aim to kill him if he comes round here . CHARITY CLARKSON I 'd hate to marry a man with blood on his hands . GEORGE DOZIER Where will you find a man any good without ? CHARITY CLARKSON I allow I ai n't looking fo ' a man jes ' now anyway . GEORGE DOZIER I allow there 's one looking fo ' you . CHARITY CLARKSON Mister Dozier , it ai n't me you want fo ' Nashville . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fo ' myself . I 've told your pappy , before he went into the woods last spring , that I could do more fo ' ye than any other man in this country . He allowed that I could . CHARITY CLARKSON I ai n't said yet that I 'd follow what pappy told me to . I ai n't said I 'd marry ye . GEORGE DOZIER But you will ? CHARITY CLARKSON I ai n't fo ' marrying a man who runs around killing everybody that gits in his way . GEORGE DOZIER It 's a killing country . I 've had to do it . I 'm starting to Nashville in the morning , Charity . Tell me yes now , so 's I can build a house there fo ' ye . p. 47 CHARITY CLARKSON I do n't know my mind , Mister Dozier . GEORGE DOZIER I can wait a while , Charity , but I 'll be bound to have ye . CHARITY CLARKSON If you say you 'll be bound to have me , like that , I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE DOZIER You would n't quarrel with me , Charity ? Nobody 's offered ye more than I. CHARITY CLARKSON Yes , I would quarrel with you , and quarrel hot . And I ai n't any little lost gentleman in a tavern for you and your friend to bait with pistols . GEORGE DOZIER Are you siding with him ? CHARITY CLARKSON I do n't say I 'm siding with anybody . Only , I do n't like your ways . And you ca n't come courting me like you go into a tavern , killing everybody that gits in your way . You can stay here a spell and cool off . And make up yo ' mind whether you came here for me or fo ' fighting . She turns and runs into the barn . HAIRY and three buckskins come out dressed alike with long rifles. 1ST BUCKSKIN If this here country gets any thicker in lawyers and thieves , I 'm a-going out to whar he is. 2ND BUCKSKIN The way I see it , leaving right now is a sort o ' treason .

MAJOR comes out and joins them . HAIRY LAKE Trial , trial , always a trial ! Mister Dozier , I do n't think I 'll go to my trial . WES comes out . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT coming up.But it 's the law , Hairy , the law ! WES BIBB It 's lawful , Hairy , sho it 's lawful . HAIRY LAKE Oh , it 's law , law , law , law ! That 's all a body hears .

Since these here prosecutors tuck hold here  --  come jabberin ' law , law , law  --  a body cai n't put a knife under a rascal 's ribs . I told my first triers I was wore out with it .

I said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that fellow Blackstone they 're jabbering about . Do you think I want it throwed up to my grandson when he grows up that his grandpappy had the law on a man ? " MAJOR SINGLEFOOT But , Hairy HAIRY LAKE Major , allow me to pester ye . Throw away yo ' cote house mind and answer in common law . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Common indeed , sir . HAIRY LAKE What air yo ' opinion o ' Colonel Boone 's jedgment in the matter ? He have slain his millions . Would he set to heel an ' allow a passel o ' lawyers to try him fo ' ticklin ' a rascal 's ribs ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Hairy , his actions are precedents for heroes , not points for indictment . p. 50 HAIRY LAKE Would he let a body o ' lawyers make rules on his physical manners in a shindy with a gentleman of sharp practice ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Hairy , he is a man o ' his own will in physical matters . HAIRY LAKE Then I ' low if Colonel Boone ever returns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SINGLEFOOT The evidence is in your favor . HAIRY LAKE Now , then , is this trial o ' mine under the Free State o ' Franklin or under No'th Carolina ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT It is brought under the jurisdiction of the State of North Carolina , sir , the Free State of Franklin bein ' temporarily in abeyance . HAIRY LAKE Major , that 's one reason why I trailed in here tonight first because I wanted you should memorize the time you and me fit the redcoats at King 's Mountain by holdin ' a shivaree but also to tell you not to defend me against the State of No'th Carolina at the cote at Nashville because I do n't pretend to go to that trial myself . I do n't think I could sit through all that law talk again . I do n't believe Daniel Boone could sit through it .

MAJOR SINGLEFOOT arising with alacrity.Here ! Here ! To BUCKSKIN near by . What 's the row about , son ? 1ST BUCKSKIN About dancin ' with Sairy , sir . There 's a mighty fine place for fightin ' down by the creek bed . Everybody can sit by the bank and see them gouge .

LONNY and CHARITY steal back for a tryst . They sit on the corn-stalks , silent a moment . CHARITY CLARKSON Let 's not , Lonny . I do n't want to see that gouging .

He 'll be here just before moondown . He said so . CHARITY CLARKSON You are trusting , Lonny . Gentlemen like him do n't fight about women like me .

I 'll take you , though . CHARITY CLARKSON How will you ? LONNY TUCKER I 'll fight Dozier fo ' you , if the Cap'n runs away . CHARITY CLARKSON brushing the hair from his forehead.Poor boy .

I 'll teach you . p. 56 CHARITY CLARKSON springing up.Look you here , Lonny Tucker . She springs up literally to confront JACKSON , who seems to have stepped out of enchantment . He is in a Continental uniform of buff and blue , remarkably splendid on the moonlit stage . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Good evening , ma'am . I trust . I 'm not too late for the fiddling . HAWK PEEVEY who follows JACKSON in and moves toward the jugs.Where be they all , Miss Charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're all down by the creek bed to a fight , Mister Peevey . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Whetting their appetites , doubtless , ma'am , for the prize main of the evening . CHARITY CLARKSON And what will that be , sir ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Why , ma'am , I believe you were there when the birds were paired . A red bantam cockerel against a South Carolina shawl neck , and later ag'in a Free State bluffer . CHARITY CLARKSON Be you the bantam , Captain ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON None other , ma'am . LONNY TUCKER coming up for the first time.Cap'n , be warned . George Dozier 's got pistols on him , ai n't tasted spirits this evening , and that there Rachel Donelson from Nashville 's been taunting him all night . She ai n't been dancing with him , not a reel , sir  --  telling him fie and foe , and how she 's saving her powers for that red-headed cap'n who ai n't afraid of the whole neighborhood . p. 57 HAWK PEEVEY drinking pleasantly.Has she now ? Bless her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may bear such a provoking honor modestly . He grins . And I 'd a sight rather have a measure with you , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON Oh , no , Cap'n , you know you 'd admire to see the widow Rachel first . Lonny , will you mind fetching her here ? LONNY TUCKER It will be a sight of trouble tearing Rachel away from a menfolk 's fight , Charity , but I reckon on this occasion she'II come . He starts off . And , Cap'n he turns and bows , arrangements have been made for sunrise , sir . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON bowing to LONNY.I thank you , sir . LONNY goes out . And , ma'am , I hate to think you are refusing a measure with me . CHARITY CLARKSON Will you go help Lonny , Mister Peevey ? HAWK PEEVEY taking in the situation.I will , ma'am , I will . Exit . CHARITY CLARKSON Captain , I got them away so 's to ask you to hit the trace now . p. 58 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON What trace , ma'am ? CHARITY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to Nashville at sunrise , and you can tail it before you reach dangerous country . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Why , ma'am , air you tired of me ? CHARITY CLARKSON How can I be tired of you , Cap'n , when I have hardly seen you yet ? I do n't know you . I do n't even want to know you . And I do n't want to see you go fighting about me . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON But it will be a pleasure , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON To be kilt by George Dozier ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Since you do n't know me , ma'am , it wo n't trouble you none . CHARITY CLARKSON But I 'd know you then , sir . All my life I 'd see you lying dead in that pretty blue coat , all account you came to dance with me . If Dozier finds you here , Cap'n , it wo n't be a duel . It 'll be a murder . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON But I do n't aim to die soon , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you finish yo ' dance . You 'll have to go . Please go . If you killed George Dozier , it 'd be unchristian ever to see you again . p. 59 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Would you mourn for him , I wonder ? CHARITY CLARKSON It 'd be my duty to mourn fo ' him . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Maybe I would n't kill him dead , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON Please go , Cap'n . I 'm a sight from being helpless . I ai n't afeared . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Who protects you , child , that you are n't afraid ? Where 's your father ? CHARITY CLARKSON He 's a long hunter , Cap'n . He 's on a party west since the spring . JACKSON . And he 's marrying you to Dozier ? CHARITY CLARKSON As soon as he gits back . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON He admires yo ' intended ? CHARITY CLARKSON That he do n't , Cap'n . Only he wants me safe . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You aim to marry him ? CHARITY CLARKSON I reckon I must . CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARKSON That he wo n't . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON fiercely.No , I allow he wo n't , either . CHARITY CLARKSON Cap'n , you wo n't be favoring me none by fighting . p. 60 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Ma'am , I trust I will . I 'm going to , sure . CHARITY CLARKSON There 'd be a sight o ' trouble . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Ma'am , you wo n't be touched by my actions . You are a flower . And I reckon Mister Dozier wo n't pluck you soon . And you wo n't have to see me again . I do n't figure on lasting long . I was born for trouble . CHARITY CLARKSON Yo ' kind is so kind they is spared , Cap'n . You were born for glory . Please hit the trail now . And when you 're passing you can lay to just beyond the last house up the trace  --  hit 's pappy 's place . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Yes , Peevey showed it to me , ma'am , as we came by . And would that outside ladder lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cap'n , right to it . After you 've passed pappy 's place , you kin join the hunters when they go through . But do n't go in the wilderness beyond . You 'd be lost in that coat if there were Injuns on your trail . They 'd want that , sho . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Will you see me , if I come by ? CHARITY CLARKSON Nobody ever passes that I do n't see him . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON And would you be so unkind as to refuse me one word when I pass there  --  for the last time ? p. 61 CHARITY CLARKSON Not if you will go now . It would be better there than here . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON But surely you can see I could n't go now . Not without dancing once with you . CHARITY CLARKSON You 'd never leave here alive if you did , Cap'n . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Indeed , ma'am , I might never want to . I might want to stay here all my life . CHARITY CLARKSON Here ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cap'n ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Would n't you know , ma'am , even now ? There are returning voices . CHARITY CLARKSON I would not . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Then I can tell you , ma'am . CHARITY CLARKSON Not here  --  I can hear them coming back . Please go , Cap'n . You kin come by at dawn . I 'll come to the window and hear . You 'll see my light in the loft . And then you 'll go down by the trail with yo ' horses and yo ' nigger . Please go , Cap'n . The voices come nearer . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON If I can sit my horse , ma'am , you will surely see me. p. 62 CHARITY CLARKSON They 're nearly here . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON There was something I wanted to tell you , and I can tell you now . She is half eager . Just now , Charity , I heard you say to that boy you ai n't never kissed back to a man . CHARITY CLARKSON Please go . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Kiss me , Charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully , with quick tenderness , and she responds . I ca n't go now , Charity . CHARITY CLARKSON Then God keep us both , Cap'n . They spring apart as HAWK , LONNY and RACHEL come on . HAWK PEEVEY They 're coming back . Long John bellowed calfrope in time to save his ear and they 're shakin ' hands on it . To RACHEL and JACKSON . Cap'n Jackson , allow me to present Miz Donelson , who is pleased to meet you . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON cocky again.Honored , ma'am , honored . RACHEL DONELSON Cap'n , I believe you scairt George Dozier into not drinking . He 's tee-total . God A'mighty , but I 'm a proud to know ye for it ! CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Why , Miz Donelson , ' t is unseemly for me to deprive a gentleman o ' his liquor when he 's so near t' other side o ' Jordan as he is tonight . p. 63 RACHEL DONELSON Air you allowing him to deprive you of yo ' refreshments , sir , or would you share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find you drinking with a body he 'd refused . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON ' T would be ungallant to refuse you anything a-tall , ma'am , up to and over a quart o ' the fiery stuff . Will you serve yo'self a small , ladylike potation , ma'am , and give me the jug ? RACHEL DONELSON pouring , as CHARITY looks on hostilely.Do you dance the Virginia reel , Cap'n ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Like an elephant , ma'am , an elephant . RACHEL DONELSON La , Cap'n , you are that modest . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Indeed , ma'am , I 'm that conceited . Miss Charity 's promised me the first reel  --  and may I pledge this to the second one with you ? RACHEL DONELSON Why , Cap'n , you should stay and dance out the night ! CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Ma'am , you are most kind . Pause . The hubbub comes nearer , and several boys and girls break in , rushing the fiddler into the barn , unconscious of the tableau by the corn-stalks . The major portion of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAIRY near by , halts at sight of JACKSON . JACKSON , finishing his mug , and conscious of the limelight , moves to CHARITY 'S side as the fiddler is heard scraping his preliminary chords.I find you unattended , ma'am . Might I claim the honor o ' the next dance ? p. 64 CHARITY CLARKSON enjoying the tension despite her fears.La , Cap'n , would you now ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Nothing could prevent me , ma'am . He places her arm in his and looks toward the crowd . Not all the cheap-jack lawyers in this here and now State of North Carolina . DOZIER takes a step forward . CHARITY 'S head goes back proudly , but she interposes her body between JACKSON and DOZIER as the latter approaches , hands caressing the waist of his coat . CHARITY CLARKSON Cap'n , I surely would hate to fetch trouble to you . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON interposing in turn , between DOZIER and CHARITY.That too would be a pleasure . I was born fo ' trouble , ma'am . Shall we go inside and dance a spell while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will indeed . GEORGE DOZIER I belive you realize , sir , that your presence here is an insult to the company and that your attentions to this lady are a personal affront to me . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Mister Dozier , I should be loath to think you spoke for this community , fo ' my feelings toward it are affable and friendly . As for you personally , sir , I am happily relieved by custom from further converse with you before the appointed hour . p. 65 GEORGE DOZIER Custom or no custom , I have something to say to you now ! And you shield yo'self , sir ! CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Ma'am , would you be so kind as to release me ? CHARITY CLARKSON No , Cap'n , I would not . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You place me in an awkward position , ma'am . Yo ' hand on my arm is withholding Mister Dozier from reaching for his pistols . Music . CHARITY CLARKSON I reckon Mister Dozier will have to wait , Cap'n Jackson , for the fiddlin 's under way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He bows . However , I shall be here quite a spell , sir . He enters the barn with CHARITY , HAWK following to cover up the rear . GEORGE DOZIER moving forward after them.By God RACHEL DONELSON crossing the stage and confronting him.See here , George Dozier , if you spoil the little thing 's jig with that gentleman I 'll swear I 'll have you tarred and feathered when you come to Nashville . LONNY TUCKER You wo n't have to , Miz Donelson . I aim to feather him myself . p. 66 GEORGE DOZIER One at a time , sir , and I 'll handle you all . He continues toward the barn . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Season yourself , Mister Dozier . ' Pears to me like you forget my preference in this matter , which can keep till after this festive occasion . DOZIER enters the barn , followed by what part of the crowd is left , save the MAJOR , HAIRY , and RACHEL . HAWK runs out from the barn . HAWK PEEVEY God A'mighty , gentlemen , you should see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Hairy , shall we repair inside and observe the antics of this yere short-lived marvel ? HAIRY LAKE I aim to see him , sir . They enter the barn . RACHEL DONELSON to HAWK , as he moves to the jugs as their backs are turned.I thank you for introducing a body like him to our neighborhood , Mister Peevey . HAWK PEEVEY That you do , Miz Donelson , and he will be a sight popular with you , I 'm sure . RACHEL DONELSON I surely envy the other ladies o ' Nashville when he gits there , Mister Peevey . HAWK PEEVEY But not the gentlemen none ! Lawd , he 'll shoot ' em all , Miz Donelson . All , ma'am . p. 67 RACHEL DONELSON Is he really warlike , now ? HAWK PEEVEY Man , he come to my doggery at sundown with a racing mare , a sporting dog , and two fighting chickens . He drank a double-glass o ' the finest , set in at whist , quarreled with two hard-roweling gentlemen , is dancing at dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise . Would that be peaceable or warlike , ma'am ? RACHEL DONELSON I 'd admire to see him slap every created man in the face , Mister Peevey . HAWK PEEVEY You will , ma'am , before cote 's in session a week . He wipes his moustache on his sleeve with an air of relish . And now , ma'am , will you go inside with me and jig about some to settle my liquor ? RACHEL DONELSON We 'd better hurry , Mister Peevey , else ' twill take holt so you ca n't dance . MAJOR and HAIRY stroll out , followed by WES . Air you quitting so soon , Mr. Lake ? I ai n't never seen you dance . HAIRY LAKE And you wo n't , Miz Donelson . He sits in a study , the MAJOR and WES taking places by him , both groaning slightly , and unsteady . He air mighty small , Major , mighty small for a body to take aim on . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT An infant , sir , an infant . p. 68 HAIRY LAKE But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turkey 's wing , and ' twill guide the bullet to the mark . WES BIBB To the mark , sho . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I 'd a sight rather he had darker clothing , gentlemen , and a larger body . My liquor 's tuck hold of my shooting arm like a snapping-turtle . HAIRY LAKE Major , if you was only to say the word I could drop him fo ' you without a mite o ' trouble , not a mite . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Hairy , yo ' words pain me inexpressibly  --  inexpressibly , sir . Do you want I should die dishonored ? LONG JOHN , a long , utterly dirty and disheveled buckskin , comes painfully and sadly from the forest , limping . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT quickly.Move over , Hairy , and let Long John set . He 's mortifying from having lost the fight . HAIRY LAKE Sho . I lost one once . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT as LONG JOHN sits.Do n't feel so downcast , Long John . It 's the carriage o ' the man in action , and not the infliction o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race so glorious . LONG JOHN de profundis.I kai n't help it , Major , I kai n't help it . He is weeping a little. p. 69 WES BIBB Sho . What 's losing a fight ? I 've lost every one I ever had , and look at me . HAIRY LAKE Let 's drink to him , gentlemen , let 's drink to him . He 's up and pouring four . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Just wet the bottom o ' mine , Hairy , I 'm foundered in fathoms . Long John , did I never tell you about the time that Colonel Boone fit the gouging match with three Iroquoy Indians , and lost it , thus becoming a full member o ' the tribe ?  --  Thank you , Hairy . Drinks . Colonel Boone was trying to find the headwaters o ' the Elk River , and had had right smart annoyance from the Iroquoy . He had n't been exactly lost ; but he confessed later he had been bewildered fo ' fo ' days . Drinks . Daniel had n't fetched his rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fretted with kickshaws and designs , brought on from London by Lord Dunmore and presented to Daniel as a token o ' royal esteem . Daniel was proud of it , and he jus ' would n't take it along in river work fo ' fear o ' rusting it . It certainly gave the advantage to three thousand Injuns for Colonel Boone to be armed only with his knife and hatchet . Drinks . But the important thing , gentlemen , was that the Indians did n't know that he had n't fetched it along . It certainly gave the advantage to Daniel . Drinks . Well , at daybreak the Injuns divided into three savage war parties , a thousand painted heathen in each force . So Colonel Boone took up a position on a bluff overlooking the headwaters o ' the Kaintuck River , and left Injun signs all ' long that he had done bloodied the wampum and was in one o ' his tantrums . No sooner had the Iroquoy picked up the wampum belt than they called a council o ' war . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lamentations o ' their widows an ' old men , to offer Colonel Boone a limited proposition o ' war . Three Injuns , which seemed fair enough to their chiefs , would fight Colonel Boone simultaneously , any weapons he chose , the Injuns to leave the country if they lost , or Colonel Boone to marry into the tribe , if he lost , and take for his squaws all the bereaved widows he had made among the tribes in previous depredations . When they sent messengers up the bluff and put it up to Colonel Boone it seemed fair enough to Daniel . Drinks . He chose to fight a gouging match . p. 70 LONG JOHN With three Iroquoy Injuns , Major ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Full-blooded , son , and I do believe to my soul that two of ' em were rising eight foot tall . HAIRY springs up at this and begins to prowl about the stage . LONG JOHN He might ' a ' whupped three Cherokees , now , but Iroquoys is different . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT draining his cup.Son , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Okefenokee who 'd ' a ' tackled Daniel on his sick-bed . After seven hours o ' gouging , Colonel Boone found himself unable to continue on account o ' two broken arms . He accepted his defeat with good grace and was instantly adopted into full fellowship by the five nations , showered with weapons , peltries , an ' hosses , and manfully endowed with wives . The Delawares alone sent him a bevy of twenty wives as a wedding present . Well , sir , Daniel endured the marriage state three hundred and seven days , keeping the Indian faith and hunting eighteen hours a day to keep his numerous family in b'ar-meat . When he escaped , it is said that the lamentations o ' his widows started the Elk River out o ' its banks and cleaved its present bed deep enough for flatboat navigation . LONG JOHN Did he go back , Major ? p. 71 MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Son , he was afeared to  --  fo ' he learned that his offspring numbered three hundred and fourteen infants , suh , only seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of barn. 1ST BUCKSKIN Major , Mister Dozier allows that this blue-coat monkey disporting himself inside is the identical foreigner who is sent out here to set up North State law in our halls o ' justice . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT The identical man ! 2ND BUCKSKIN Major , I kai n't believe a man is so rash . 1ST BUCKSKIN We sho'ly could not . 2ND BUCKSKIN Air we suckling puff-adders to our bosoms in this Free State of ours ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT rising portentously.Gentlemen , you 're doubtless aware that Mister Dozier and myself are confronting this young man with weapons in our hands at sunrise . In my opinion the fate o ' the Free State rests on the outcome of our encounter . 1ST BUCKSKIN Major , your honor and your marksmanship air beyond reproach . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT If he fell prematurely , gentlemen , or by any other hand before the set time of our engagement , my name would be irretrievably soiled . If Mister Dozier has given a contrary impression . p. 72 1ST BUCKSKIN Mister Dozier informed us who he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you reckon the young man is taking advantage of his coming encounter to flaunt himself in our faces , sir ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT I do not . In justice to his carriage , I say I do not . I reckon he holds himself able to take care o ' himself anywhere . 1ST BUCKSKIN Then we wo n't tetch him , sir . 3RD BUCKSKIN No , sir , we wo n't . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Gentlemen , I thank you . He sits. 3RD BUCKSKIN But we kin question him . 2ND BUCKSKIN I reckon we kin question him , Major ? MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Up to the limits of violence , I jedge it would do no harm to question him . HAIRY LAKE Then I aim to question him myself , Major , because I kai n't set still when he 's around . He begins to pace up and down with knit brows , near the barn door . JACKSON comes out with CHARITY , sees the group , turns with her in the opposite direction , she leaning breathlessly on his arm , and runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 73 CHARITY CLARKSON Evening , sir . HAIRY LAKE Would it trouble you none , ma'am , if I mought pester yo ' gentleman with a little catechism ? CHARITY CLARKSON It wo n't none , Mr. Lake ; and I make no doubt it wo n't trouble him none , either . HAIRY LAKE May I trouble you , sir ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON bowing.Yo ' servant , sir . HAIRY LAKE It remains to be seen . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Truly enough seeing as I am here to press with force and zeal the rights of the old North State in its claims against all transgressors . HAIRY LAKE Mister CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON bowing.Cap'n , sir . HAIRY LAKE bowing still lower.Cap'n it be , sir . Cap'n , I aim to set you right . I ' low a man given to jabbering justice and transgressors just natchelly kai n't be my servant , sir . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Are you under criminal indictment , sir ? HAIRY LAKE I am , sir . As this dialogue begins , DOZIER steps from the door , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the climax. p. 74 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Your charge ? HAIRY LAKE Killin ' a rascal , sir . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Then it will be my duty , if there is no palliation , to get you hanged , sir , as high as Haman was hanged in Scripture . HAIRY LAKE Well , now , Cap'n , it will indeed . WES BIBB It will , sho it will . HAIRY LAKE And might I question you now , Cap'n , on a matter a little mo ' personal to me ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON If this lady accords , sir . CHARITY CLARKSON Sho . I 'm enjoying myself . HAIRY LAKE Is North Carolina in the Union , or not ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON It is . It is . HAIRY LAKE Is there a Union law excising a tax on the making of spirits , or not ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON There is none yet , but it has been determined upon . HAIRY LAKE If the Free State was in the Union would I be obliged to pay a tax on my liquor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Very likely you will . HAIRY LAKE Putting that aside , Cap'n , who air the first gentleman o ' the land , sir ? p. 75 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON His Excellency , General Washington . HAIRY LAKE To the mark . WES BIBB Right . To the mark . HAIRY LAKE Hush , Wes ; I 'm drivin ' him to hit . And does the General ferment the grain and distill it through the worm , sir ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I believe the landed gentry o ' the East prefer to make their own spirits , sir . HAIRY LAKE And does his Excellency ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I believe so . HAIRY LAKE And does he pay excise tax on those spirits , sir ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON He does not . HAIRY LAKE The President air still in the best o ' health ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON He is , Sir . HAIRY LAKE He air still addicted to his toddy ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I should conjecture so . HAIRY LAKE He air still addicted to not paying excise tax on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the presumption is in yo ' favor . p. 76 HAIRY LAKE And he air generally credited with being the wisest among living creeturs ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON He is so held in the East , sir . HAIRY LAKE Then that settles it , sir . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON What , sir ? HAIRY LAKE It settles it that if that 's all the wisdom they is in the East it 's better to be in the Free State than in the North State . It settles it that the Free State will never join up with the excise tax states . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON But an excise tax on spirits may be necessary for the maintenance of the armies of Congress , armies for your defense against the British , against the French , against his Majesty o ' Spain . HAIRY LAKE How would our boys fight better if their liquor costs more ? What would General Washington say to that ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON General Washington has urgently requested the Congress to put a heavy national excise upon distillates of all states , the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did the General do that , Cap'n ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I give you my word , he has , sir . HAIRY LAKE Then the General is a crack-brained , dumb fool , Cap'n . p. 77 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I agree to that , sir . A scoundrel in his old age , sir , yet my superior officer and yours also , and the Major 's likewise . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT rising , swaying.You will fight me fo ' that , sir ! You will fight me first because he is no scoundrel , and second because he has no authority here ! He sinks down , drunken . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You may include that in yo ' bill o ' particulars , sir . I say he has authority here , and will have . He has authority here under the pledges of the various colonies , the ark o ' our liberty , which it is treason and madness to defy . As HAIRY has been speaking , the BUCKSKINS have grouped about him , evidently dying to join the debate . They take it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of dogs around a bear , but with the utmost gentility and courtesy , which should only serve to give the thing a pall of high , compressed danger. 1ST BUCKSKIN Whose liberty ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Yours , sir . 1ST BUCKSKIN Allowed me , I figger , by your Congress away up yonder , three months away , at Philadelphia . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON True , sir , three months away , but a Congress in which you have a voice . p. 78 2ND BUCKSKIN a man of forty , ferocious-looking.Look here , Cap'n , I allow I have a mighty powerful voice . There ai n't another man in the Cumberlands to compare . I have called my dogs three miles to a b'ar-pit on a clear autumn night like this . But I kai n't make my holler heard in Congress . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON True , sir , but you can send a delegate to make your wishes heard there . 3RD BUCKSKIN Supposin ' we do n't want to . I aim to be able to do all my own talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hairy Lake 's , in this here country . I aim to have my share in our own congress we aim to hold here . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Precisely , sir , and you have thet own congress in the North Carolina Assembly . 2ND BUCKSKIN It ai n't ours . I have been down to the settlements . What 's in ' em ? Why , a bee-swarm o ' galoots , trying to keep alive by selling each other calico cloth and whisky . All the rules they have air for galoots that sell calico cloth and whisky . 1ST BUCKSKIN Drive him to it , drive him to it . 2ND BUCKSKIN And now they are to excise-tax me fo ' making my own whisky . I do n't aim to buy their calico cloth , so befo ' long they 'll try to excise-tax me for tanning my own buckskin shirt . I do n't believe I 'm going to heed your rules . p. 79 3RD BUCKSKIN And you air one o ' them , Cap'n ; it 's you air bringing their laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them we shall bring schools for yo ' offspring , protection fo ' yo ' womenfolks , guarantees for your liberties . 1ST BUCKSKIN Ef you bring protection , how come you kai n't travel the trail to Nashville without long-hunters to protect you ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Why , gentlemen , as you protect the trails from the Iroquoy , the North State will protect you from England and the dastards of Spain . On the trail back a few days is Judge McNairy , with all the county officers necessary for law and order , for schools , for militia , for peace and the pursuit of happiness . The people of North Carolina contribute these things out of their taxes , sir , and from the affection they bear her sons on the far frontier . 1ST BUCKSKIN Even if I was to put up with North Carolina , Cap'n , because it ai n't fur away , and they know me , yet I wo n't put up with Philadelphia . And if we 're in the North State we 're under Philadelphia . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUCKSKIN We wo n't trust ' em that far fo ' our liberty . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You have safeguards under the constitution they proffer , sir . p. 80 HAIRY LAKE Now , Cap'n , you rile me . He ascends to anger as his argument progresses . Now you tetch me and affect me . When they told me , when they come pleading with me and my eldest boy to rally our boys at King 's Mountain and shoot the red-coats there , they told me that we would get shet o ' foreigners making rules for free men to follow . I went , and I fit them . I was the hunter that kilt the big fellow in the pink coat and the white wig . But when I come home I hearn that up North they had drawed up another set o ' rules , just like the red-coat rules and they tell me he is terribly passionatethey call the thing a constitution , and they 'll make me sign it . Well , I 'm not going to sign . I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make my whisky or tan my shirts , and I 'm not going to let anybody in Philadelphia tell me how I got to make my whisky and tan my shirts . And if you 've come bringing them rules , I 'm not a-going to have ye . I wo n't put up with ye . I fit ye once and I 'll fight ye again . I 'll fight ye now . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON If you want your own congress here , sir , nothing could be nearer Judge McNairy 's heart . When you have ten leaders like him you can have your Tennessee country made into a state . Sir , I confide this in you . I can put no heart into my defense of a federal constitution . I am for states ' rights . I am for old North Carolina before everything else . p. 81 HAIRY LAKE That 's what we 're trying to teach you , Cap'n . We ai n't in the old North State here . We 're Free State here  --  Nolichucky Jack Sevier 's Free State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Colonel Sevier is a very brave man , but he has lost his dispute with the Governor of North Carolina and is heading an expedition west . HAIRY LAKE He 'll come back . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON It would take him a year , sir . And meanwhile , if you have no statehood , who will police your border , ringed with a thousand dangers ? Who will punish your Indians ? 1ST BUCKSKIN We will . HAIRY LAKE Answer yea or nay , Cap'n . Fur or agin the Free State ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON The Free State is disbanded at Jonesborough . How kin I be for it when it is n't there any mo ' ? HAIRY LAKE Would ye be for a new state if we got up one ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Yes , if we took in all the Tennessee and Cumberland country and proved ourselves men enough to hold it . HAIRY LAKE If we told you there was a new Free State at this moment , and told you who was head of it and who was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON It would depend on the men you named , sir . HAIRY LAKE Then I 'll name them , sir Three Or Four Buckskins . No , no ! GEORGE DOZIER Not to him , sir . HAIRY LAKE And why not to him ? Major ! Major ! 1ST BUCKSKIN He 's down , Hairy . The MAJOR is drunk , asleep . HAIRY LAKE Mister Dozier , why not ? He 's for us , or he never gits to Nashville . GEORGE DOZIER Then speak out . HAIRY LAKE There is a new Free State , Cap'n  --  you hear that ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I hear you , sir . HAIRY LAKE A new Free State , sir , officered by Major Single-foot and Mister George Dozier . Air ye fur it or ag'in it ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Against it , sir . One of yo ' leaders is a blackleg lawyer , the other  --  you see him fo ' yourself . You are set for failure before you start . GEORGE DOZIER When your Judge McNairy reaches Nashville , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in operation and a militia of free men ready to pack him and his followers back to the sutlers who sent them . p. 83 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON If you were ever to reach Nashville , sir , which you will not , you would find an officer of the North State at the cote house , and you and your kind excluded from practice . From the moment I set foot in Nashville next week , no Free State license such as yours is valid before the Nashville bar . GEORGE DOZIER Leaving you free to run things , your plan , and steal to suit yourself ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You have been there some little time , sir . I doubt there 's anything left to steal . GEORGE DOZIER You hear him , gentlemen . HAIRY LAKE We sho'ly hear him . GEORGE DOZIER Stand from between us . We have heard a good many of yo ' opinions , sir . When have you a mind to quit opinionating and do some fighting ? His hands are under his coat , adjusting the priming . CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you propose ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON To count three under my breath after I step to this mark and then kill you . Bows . You may commence firing . He steps and stands thin . DOZIER draws a flintlock and fires . JACKSON flinches slightly . He then , with utter care , extracts a pistol , adjusts the flint , balances the barrel rather awkwardly on his free arm , and fires . DOZIER falls face forward , dead. p. 84 HAIRY LAKE crossing quickly , turning him over , then putting him back.Right in the heart . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT coming to from the sound of the shots , and twisting until he sees the figure ; then calling rather stupidly.Mister Dozier , Mister Dozier ! HAIRY LAKE , He kai n't hear no mo ' , Major . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT He fought , Hairy ? HAIRY LAKE He did , Major . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT My God I 've let a man die in my place . Die for me . I 'll never wet my lips to spirits again . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I 'm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SINGLEFOOT I beg pardon for failing you , sir . He is rather pathetic . I 'm ready to meet you now instantly . He rises heavily . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I regret my being rude to you this evenin ' , sir . I apologize , sir , and beg to be excused from exchanging shots with you until you appear mo ' composed . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Do n't crawl like a worm , boy . Hard . Because I 'll kill you , sho . Stand and take my fire . p. 85 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Any time , sir . It is yo ' privilege . Sir , stand and take your fire . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT We shall want an umpire with a pocket napkin a white one , sir , fo ' my eyes is dim . He is standing as erect as possible . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Then make haste , sir . Weakly , one shoulder drooping . MAJOR SINGLEFOOT Quick , gentlemen , a white pocket napkin . WES takes his wig , drops it , and the MAJOR fires , and stands blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , some brandy , and help me git to the tavern . I aim to take the trail this mornin ' , but I have an errand first , a mile up the road a mile up the road . HAIRY LAKE standing over him. Why , a wound in the shoulder ! Sho , it 's too near being out to bother you much . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON ' T was Dozier wounded me . HAIRY LAKE I marked it . God , Cap'n , that was as polite and mannerly as anything I ever see ! MAJOR SINGLEFOOT still blind and swaying.Take yo ' fire , sir , take yo ' fire . Do you want to dishonor me thet-away ? JACKSON fires pistol in air. @x A loft under a triangular cabin roof , on a log floor adzed and puncheoned . A door opening right and swinging wide into the moonlight , with a log ladder running from outside into inside . At rear , heavy outline of chimney , with corner in black shadow . At left a huge fourpost bed , made of logs trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts , on which are articles of pioneer clothing . A trap door by the bed and against the wall opens from below . Buffalo robe on floor by bed . As curtain rises two children , a boy and a girl , near the ages of twelve and ten , are sleeping in the middle of the bed , which is furnished with a patchwork quilt and a coarse top sheet . No sound , save one call from a whippoorwill , which to the backwoods is the sign of death . Charity comes breathless up the outside ladder , moves to cubby-hole , listens , moves to bed . The whippoorwill greets her as she moves over to the window . More resigned , she walks over to the bed again . She has moved with swiftness , but not too much excitement . CHARITY CLARKSON Cissy ! CISSY CLARKSON turning softly.Ummm . CHARITY CLARKSON Cissy , wake up ! CISSY CLARKSON Ummmmmm. p. 87 CHARITY CLARKSON I 'll be bound to tell ye , Cissy . CISSY CLARKSON burrowing deeper.In the morning . CHARITY CLARKSON ' Two n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with finality.Ummmmmmmmm . CHARITY CLARKSON A turrible thing oh No answer or interest . She moves to the boy . Simon Kenton ! No answer at all . Simon I got to tell somebody . She lifts him up . Simon , a man 's been killed account o' me ! SIMON , released , falls back lethargic . A fight , Simon , a turrible fight , and Mister George Dozier 's dead ! No answer . She moves back to CISSY . A body 's got to tell somebody . Desperately . Mammy She moves to cubby-hole . Mammy , Mammy , are ye awake ? Answer ! The whippoorwill answers . Hush , you whippoorwill ! She crosses to the window . I know somebody 's dead . To bedside again , shaking CISSY . CISSY CLARKSON Leave me be , waking a body befo ' sunrise . Under covers now. p. 88 CHARITY CLARKSON talking to both.The little Cap'n was there , dressed like a turkey-cock . He rowed with Mister Dozier over me , and shot him through the breast . Oh , God , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' kilt him sho ' , if he wa' n't such a gentleman to the Major . I 'm bound I 'll have to run away from here befo ' Pappy comes home and finds out . And he was going to bring me a b'arskin promised he would , to cover the hope-chist God , I never see a man so clost-shootin ' or so cool said he 'd kill him , and did kill him . When he looked at me as he walked away with Hairy , with George Dozier lying there turnin ' cold in the moonlight , something sorter came over me like a graveyard rabbit I was that paralyzed when Rachel Robard and Sairy Bibb came to me . " You 'll go home with us mimicking , po ' little thing ! " they said . " A widder befo ' bein ' a bride " an ' there he was with the blood running down his uniform coat and Hairy Lake sayin ' he 'd put fo ' inches o ' huntin ' - knife into the man that tetched him , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cap'n walking away to the tavern to git his horse and not looking at me , Cissy . She touches her . He was thinkin ' on me , though . I knowed it , an ' my face ran as red as pokeberry juice when I knowed I was thinkin ' on him , too , with George Dozier lyin ' there fish-white from the life-blood that 'd left him . " Po ' little thing , " they said , " look how she stands it . " I run then , Cissy , run like a turkey right past them all , and I could feel the Cap'n 's eyes on the back o ' my head like sunshine through a bonnet . He 'd kilt George Dozier account o ' me , and I 'd kissed him back befo ' he done it an ' I 'll never lay eyes on the like o ' him again . She dramatizes . " I heard you say , Charity , that you ai n't never kissed back to a man " and I was reeling from the cinamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken man , Cissy . He came up close and said , " Kiss me , Charity , " and when he put his arms on me I could n't say whether it was his heart or mine doing the pumping pumping like a rabbit when you take him from a snare , and George Dozier begging me inside just befo ' fo ' a kiss , when he never knowed it might be the last one , when we did the hoot-owl in the reel . Remember how Pappy danced befo ' the do ' in the moonlight last spring ? The tanbark on the flo ' was too slippery-soft fo ' a body to dance on , and if Jackson took my hand I thought it would stick too fast for a body ever to pull us apart . " Would n't you know , ma'am , even now ? " " Come by , " I told him , Cissy , " come by our place and climb the ladder and tell me . " But he wo n't come . Wake up , Cissy , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thing you dream about when you ai n't too tired . God A'mighty , but he was cool , Cissy , cool as the churn in the spring-hole . " I can tell you , ma'am . " But he did n't tell me . He kissed me . You kai n't tell by kissin ' . You have to come by and tell , when you 're leavin ' a place fo'ever . She runs to the cubby-hole . Mammy , Mammy , Mammy , Mammy ! Long low calls. p. 89 A VOICE Sh , sh , sh CHARITY CLARKSON You awake , Mammy ? MRS . CLARKSON Sh ! You 'll wake the little children down here , Charity . Git in yo'bed . If you wake ' em I 'll never git ' em to sleep again , with their pappy so far away in the woods and that whippoorwill a-hootin ' so chill . CHARITY CLARKSON Mammy , George Dozier 's been killed . MRS . CLARKSON God A'mighty oh , God A'mighty . Dumb at first . CHARITY CLARKSON Killed in a fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the bed.It kai n't be . It kai n't be . CHARITY CLARKSON I seed him kilt , Mammy . MRS . CLARKSON He kai n't be . He was here six hours ago . Cries . " I 'll soon call you Mother , " he said . CHARITY CLARKSON Do n't cry so , Mammy ! Do n't cry so . She is by her . MRS . CLARKSON sobbing.Who done it , Charity ? CHARITY CLARKSON The little Cap'n from the tavern that I saw . p. 90 MRS . CLARKSON I hope they hang him . Po ' George Dozier ! Oh , Charity , God has struck ye a heavy blow ! Po ' George Dozier ! They 'll hang him . CHARITY CLARKSON Hush , Mammy ! It were a duel . MRS . CLARKSON crying.Why did n't somebody stop it ? Why did n't somebody stop it ? CHARITY CLARKSON Hit come too quick . He was dead in a second , with a bullet in his breast and his face in the willow leaves , right by the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're ruined , child , ruined . She puts her arms about her . All yo ' life you 'll slave fo ' some po ' man . Why did God take him from ye . Oh , God , why did Ye take him from her ? CHARITY CLARKSON It ' pears that God did , though . And saved t' other man . The little Cap'n gave him first shot . MRS . CLARKSON drying her eyes for details.Did n't Mister Dozier take it ? CHARITY CLARKSON Hit the Cap'n in the breast bone , but the ball must ' a ' turned wide . I seed the blood befo ' he fired and killed Mister Dozier I seed p. 91 MRS . CLARKSON stopping her. Do n't , Charity , do n't ! Put that out o ' mind . Gets up and leads her to bed . Do n't think on it , no mo ' . Who fetched ye home , child ? Did Lonny bring ye ? CHARITY CLARKSON I was flustered . I run home through the woods by myself . MRS . CLARKSON Po @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bride . She is fumbling , with the buttons of CHARITY 'S white dress . Undress , sweet thing , and git in the bed . CHARITY CLARKSON I kai n't , Mammy , I kai n't . I kai n't go to bed . I 'm flustered . MRS . CLARKSON Come down with me , Charity . I 'll make a pallet . CHARITY CLARKSON I kai n't . I want to stay here . MRS . CLARKSON she has got the dress off.Say yo ' prayers , Charity , and ask God to have mercy on George Dozier 's soul . CHARITY CLARKSON Yes , Mammy , I allow I 'll say a long one befo ' I sleep . You go now . I ai n't lonely any mo ' . She looks to the window . MRS . CLARKSON They ought to do something to the man that killed him . He was such a fine figure , too . Cries . He 'd ' a ' made ye a lady . p. 92 CHARITY CLARKSON leads her to the trapdoor.I do n't aim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . MRS . CLARKSON I sha' n't close my eyes . Pausing at the cubby . Have ye cried much ? CHARITY CLARKSON I ai n't , Mammy , they wo n't come . MRS . CLARKSON Lie down , sweet thing , and cry . The funeral 's goin ' to try ye something awful if ye do n't . CHARITY CLARKSON I do n't aim to break down . MRS . CLARKSON You kin live in this house with me an ' yo ' pappy all yo ' days , Charity . CHARITY CLARKSON The Cap'n could ' a ' killed the Major , if he 'd wanted , Mammy . MRS . CLARKSON Do n't think on it , Charity . The Lord calls us , or He does n't . We kai n't ask why He took George Dozier from ye and let some rascal go on . CHARITY CLARKSON I allow he ai n't a rascal , Mammy . Her voice raised . MRS . CLARKSON Sh , sh ! Do n't wake the little ones little Dan'l Boone 's gums air a sight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . She goes down ; whispers . Good night , Charity , say yo ' prayers . p. 93 CHARITY CLARKSON Good night , Mammy . CHARITY comes to the bed and takes her clothing , looks at the door as if afraid to put them on . Folds them , crosses to the window by the chest , and puts them up . Goes back , resigned , gets into bed , and tries to sleep . The whippoorwill brings her up again . Cissy ! Not shaking the child ; simply talking . I got to tell somebody . I kai n't tell Mammy . I kissed him back . I kissed him back when I knowed he was lyin ' to me . Had n't said he loved me . Had n't said anything at all . Just looked at me and wanted to kiss me , and I wanted to kiss him . If he 'd ' a ' asked me , I 'd had to kiss him after he shot Dozier befo ' ' em all . I ran away past the Bibb house fo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiss me , Charity , " and I 'd ' a ' done it . I passed the tavern where I fust saw him when he looked so pretty an ' cool . He was scairt a little by Dozier . ' T was why he would n't look at me when the boys was pestering him . I could ' a ' cried fo ' him then when I saw . I 'd ' a ' rocked him to sleep like you rock a rag doll befo ' the fire . I 'd shut his eyes , even if they can be sharp as chestnut burrs He 'll go away and there wo n't ever be another one in a pretty blue coat with the moon prying deep into the woods an ' he never said a pretty word . Just looked . Sometimes they takes us she sighs , and sometimes they leave us . So cool and springy in his heels , with hair like a painter 's ruff it bristled when he set in at cards and gave George Dozier his death-look . Her head is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would n't ye know , now , ma'am , would n't ye know " Pause . The whippoorwill makes her sit up . But ye wo n't know , now . Ye wo n't ever know , unless he comes by . Cissy , why could n't he say , for me to remember . She starts , for she hears sounds on the ladder . She looks to the window , not sure of her senses . JACKSON comes in , the same as before , except for a fresh shirt , and stands looking at her from the moonlit doorway . I knowed ye 'd come I knowed ye 'd come p. 94 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON softly.I passed a whippoorwill on the big rock . Does he set there every night ? CHARITY CLARKSON He 's come back from mating . He went away last spring . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON He scared me something terrible when I went by him just now . Smiles . CHARITY CLARKSON He scared me , too . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Are ye scared ofttimes ? CHARITY CLARKSON Oft . Are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide it . CHARITY CLARKSON Ye kai n't hide it from me . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Was I scared at the tavern ? CHARITY CLARKSON No . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON When was I scared at the barn ? CHARITY CLARKSON ' Most all the time . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON All the time . He looks about , sees the chest , goes to it . May I set on this ? CHARITY CLARKSON It 's the only place there is . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Looks like a treasure-chest . Sits gingerly. p. 95 CHARITY CLARKSON ' T is a hope-chest fo ' me . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON How might a body shet up hope in a chist ? CHARITY CLARKSON Backwoods gals do that all o ' their life . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Do they ketch hope with their hands , or shoot it on the wing ? CHARITY CLARKSON They sew things fo ' it . When they 're dreaming about a fellow they know never will come . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Have ye sewed long ? CHARITY CLARKSON I started an apron when I was rising thirteen I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was going on to sixteen I was hoping fo ' nothing in creation but a military uniform . CHARITY CLARKSON At thirteen I was pining fo ' a hunter in yaller buckskin . Law ! I was that silly . Pappy was pioneering with Colonel Donaldson down the Cumberland and were trailing no'th to French country . I dreamed one night that a hunter came back with him in the fall and brought me a buffalo robe and a white elk 's skin and I never even knowed then if they was white elks . Now , wa' n't that something else to dream ? But I dreamed it that he brought it to make white shoes fo ' the wedding , fo ' him and fo ' me . He was taller in my dream than Hairy Lake nigh six foot six , and I began sewing on my apron that 's in that chist the very next day . p. 96 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON How 'd ye know he was so tall ? CHARITY CLARKSON Because he said , " Charity , my darling thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone and kilt ye a white elk with a six-foot skin . And when he helt it up to spread it around me , it reached from his moccasins to the roots o ' his golden beard . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON studiously , enviously.I been studyin ' fo ' six months over raising a golden beard . CHARITY CLARKSON Have ye been studyin ' about growing to six foot six , Mister Jackson ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I 'd ' a ' made it , but I reckon I 've had mo ' than half a foot o ' growth a-scairt out o ' me , time to time . Back in the Waxhaws where I was born , there come times when I took a thrashing a day . CHARITY CLARKSON Who thrashed ye so ? Ye must have been an endearin ' little redhead . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Red-coats scared me . When Tarleton 's horse came dragooning our boys from the settlements , to put red coats on ' em and make ' em fight fo ' the Tories and their king . I reckon every boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would go out in the wood fo ' a stand-up fight , and the leetle boys would trail off after them and try to shoot bullets a thousand yards . The red-coats ketched me . One time I was down in a hollow on my belly firing down the crick to where I 'd seen a red-coat in the brush , when I looked around and two o'them were standing right over me . " What ye shooting at , little traitor ? " they said . I knew ' twa' n't any use , and I was scairt out o ' growth when I knew it . " You , " I said . When they carried me away I was scairt to death fo ' fear they 'd hang me for spying , because I was too po ' to buy a Carolina uniform . p. 97 CHARITY CLARKSON If I 'd knowed , I 'd made ye one and fetched it to ye . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I expect you were too busy sewing up hope in a chist . A pause . CHARITY CLARKSON Do ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Sometimes , but I did n't make up that one . CHARITY CLARKSON When you come into Mister Peevey 's at sundown and I saw ye , it was like seeing a soldier in the coulds at sunset . I said to myself , " Now ye 're making up things again , Charity . Ai n't nobody in this tavern like what ye see , at all . " CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON But I was standing there when you came in , and I did n't expect you . Likely I looked so taken that it was a dreamy thing the way we first saw each other . I had come riding down that glen on the east o ' the hill , through that long bank o ' dogwood trees , thinking how white and shining they 'd be , come next April , and when you sailed through the tavern door in yo ' smock , I said to myself , " Why , cote 's over , and April 's come again . " A pause . CHARITY CLARKSON But I wa' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chist you 're setting on , soaking in heart-leaves I got last April from under the pines . p. 98 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Was it heart-leaves ? I could n't fetch the smell to my memory . But now I see ' em plain , just how you come upon ' em , pushing through last year 's needles . Ai n't anything prettier growing . CHARITY CLARKSON Pappy always says , after I 've been sowing oats after him all afternoon and we come in at night , that there ai n't a prettier sight anywhere in the world than a field of grain , ripe for scything . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Does your pappy farm , too ? CHARITY CLARKSON Ai n't a busier man , or kinder . Mammy says in eighteen years o ' being married to him he ai n't never made her or a child clear an acre o ' land or break a sod o ' soil . Do ye like to farm ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I farmed . Worked a place two years near Salisbury . But I declare , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing ever happening to excite a body at all . I guess I 'd rather be where there 's a chance every coon 's age o ' being scairt out o ' growth . CHARITY CLARKSON If ye do n't remember how the field smells in the evening , ye do n't like to farm . The whippoorwill calls twice , clearly nearer , and CHARITY shudders . JACKSON involuntarily starts as she does so , leaping like a cat to the middle of the floor . There , a worried expression comes on his face as he works at the clothing under his right armpit with his left hand . Did he scare ye , too ? p. 99 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON still working.I suppose he did . CHARITY CLARKSON beginning to see.Does it she is skirting a subject they 've avoided does it pain ye so , po ' boy ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON tries to smile faintly.None a-tall . None a-tall . But when ye sighed , it made me jump , and I sorter slipped the poultice . CHARITY CLARKSON Why , you po ' thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ! CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON moving to her.P'raps you kin fix it better . Hitch it fo ' me , please . Sits on side of bed , his back to her . CHARITY CLARKSON I 've a mind to have you strip yo ' shirt and let me wrap it over again . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Thank ye , no , do n't take it off ; it 's drawin ' . It 's mo ' a bruise on the breast-blade than a bleed . Peevey 's poulticed it with slippery ellum bark . Smells good enough to chew , do n't it ? CHARITY CLARKSON her hands are slightly atremble.Hit 's the best stuff ever proximity unsteadies her fo ' a bruise or a blow . ' T is so near yo ' heart , too . p. 100 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I reckon it 'd clear up quicker , seein ' where ' t is near , if Peevey 'd used some o ' the heart-leaves from a hopechist . CHARITY CLARKSON You better stay here on the hill till it cleans , and get slippery ellum bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and sweetness.As long as I got strength , I got to keep on to Nashville . I got to keep on . CHARITY CLARKSON trembling.Because when ye are scairt , ye kin hide it . But ye do n't want to tax yo'self . A body ought to rest his strength after what a body 's been through . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Not when a body 's got strength from a new fountain , tonight . CHARITY CLARKSON dropping her arms.How 'd ye git new strength ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON turning , husky.From yo ' lips . CHARITY CLARKSON pause , and then a blushing head.Ai n't a body making up a thing again that never happen a-tall ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON A body disremembers . He never would remember , unless it happen again to prove it . p. 101 CHARITY CLARKSON It does seem like a thing a body 's made up . Maybe after all it did n't happen . Confessional , head down . I been trying to remember , too . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Maybe if I 'd put my mind to it I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon came down to look at ye ! But ' t is all . The rest is cloudy . Maybe you could remember how a body rode through on the trail to Nashville and the wilderness . CHARITY CLARKSON Maybe I could recollect how a red-head boy in an ole blue coat , who was born fo ' trouble and who could hide it when he was scairt CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Went on to Nashville where mo ' trouble was awaitin ' him , ready fo ' it only because an angel-body in a white dress stood under the moon and kissed him , and then CHARITY CLARKSON picking up his thread . Then run home and waited fo ' him to come by and tell her what he never has told her . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON What he never told her because he never told a body befo ' . Because he never told anybody befo ' and do n't know how to say it . Because he ai n't flowery enough to tell her they kissthat she is mo ' beautiful than a pink-footed pigeon by a waterfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms.Now ye are makin ' up things fo ' me to remember . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You eternally believe I 'm makin ' up things . CHARITY CLARKSON I want you to , when a body makes ' em up as pretty as you do . I 'm only afeard you 'll begin to tell me what 's gospel truth . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON What would I say , if I told you what 's gospel truth ? CHARITY CLARKSON If I would n't want you to say it , would I admire to say it fo ' myself ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I know one thing . Close into her ear . CHARITY CLARKSON What is it ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON You put yo ' arms around me by yourself . CHARITY CLARKSON playful.Was it forward o ' me , Cap'n Jackson ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Oh , turrible forward of you , ma'am ! Kisses her . CHARITY CLARKSON If it pesters ye , I wo n't do it no mo ' . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON It 's powerful healing fo ' a wound near the heart . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away two inches . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON It did n't hurt again till ye moved away . CHARITY CLARKSON I wished ' t was so . Morning away another two inches . But that 's one o ' the things ye fancy out fo ' me to remember . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON No ; that 's scripture .

A knocking at the door , at which the two hold closer and kiss profoundly. p. 105 LONNY 'S VOICE Mrs. Clarkson ? Mrs. Clarkson , kin I climb and see if Charity got home ? MRS . CLARKSON 'S VOICE Do n't climb the ladder , Lonny . Sound of latch and bolt downstairs . She 's home and to bed . LONNY 'S VOICE You heard , ma'am ? MRS . CLARKSON 'S VOICE Oh , Lord , wa' n't it a turrible thing fo ' him to be taken that-a-way ? It 's hard on my child , Lonny . LONNY 'S VOICE May I see her for a minute , ma'am ? I 'm jes ' bound to .

JACKSON releases CHARITY . She motions to the chimney corner . He walks there as MRS . CLARKSON ascends . CHARITY sits quiet . There , I knowed ye 'd not close yo ' eyes ! Why did n't you answer Lonny downstairs ? CHARITY CLARKSON I do n't pertend to feel like seeing him , Mammy . p. 106 MRS . CLARKSON The po ' boy 's distracted over yo ' grief .

CLARKSON starts down.Lonny Exit . Her voice floats from other window . Ye must n't be long . LONNY 'S VOICE I only want to comfort her , ma'am . He comes up to door and stands pathetic in moonlight . Charity , I had to come by . CHARITY CLARKSON I know you did . LONNY TUCKER I had to speak now , and hol ' my peace after . CHARITY CLARKSON That you did . p. 107 LONNY TUCKER Charity , after what 's happened , I ai n't going away to read for the bar . CHARITY CLARKSON It 's in yo ' blood , Lonny . Ye 'll have to . LONNY TUCKER I wo n't have to . I wanted to tell you that as soon as it gits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask him fo ' that patch o ' land by the bluff . It 's good land , Charity . I 'm going to farm , Charity . I 'm going to farm . CHARITY CLARKSON But yo ' folks have been dead set on yo ' bein ' a judge like yo ' father was , Lonny . LONNY TUCKER But I ai n't going to be a judge I came here to tell you and I wo n't come again until spring . I ca n't visit you fo ' a spell now . But I want you to know I 'll be trustin ' and hopin ' fo ' you . CHARITY CLARKSON Now , Lonny , I wo n't have yo ' givin ' in to me . LONNY TUCKER And when Joe Clarkson gets home I 'll ask fo ' ye , and when April comes we 'll roll up a log house by that dogwood bank and farm . I got a good mare , and she 'll foal in the spring . I got a young cow , and she 'll calve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll love and protect you , I 'll farm for you and hunt for you , all my life . I 'm yours , Charity , and I could n't sleep without comin ' by and tellin ' you . Without yo ' promise . p. 108 CHARITY CLARKSON Hit 's sweet o ' you , Lonny . But you got to get yo ' law papers . I wo n't study about promisin ' until you git them . Go home , Lonny , and quiet yo'self . We 've had a powerful misfortune . We ca n't think on anything else now . LONNY TUCKER You do n't have to think , Charity . I just wanted to tell you . CHARITY CLARKSON But I ca n't promise , Lonny . You got to be a lawyer . LONNY TUCKER We 're in the North State , Charity . It 'll take two years ' reading befo ' I can practice . I wa' n't fashioned fo ' the law . I was fashioned fo ' you , Charity to build a cabin , break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fo ' you . CHARITY CLARKSON Cap'n Jackson 'll give you law papers , Lonny . He will , fo ' the askin ' . Some day you 'd be a judge while he 'd be a general . LONNY TUCKER . It ai n't his to give . And you ca n't count on a man in this country , when he 's as hasty as Cap'n Jackson . You ca n't count on his surviving a week o ' Nashville life . CHARITY CLARKSON That you can ; if he 'll only rest here and quiet himself fo ' a spell . Honey , ye 're turrible upset . Please go home and quit yo ' studyin ' about me . LONNY TUCKER Nobody 'd treat you better , love you sweeter , or work fo ' you harder . p. 109 CHARITY CLARKSON Ye 'll have to go , Lonny . I 'll tell you in the morning . LONNY TUCKER Then I set beneath yo ' window , Charity . I 'll wait all night fo ' an answer . CHARITY CLARKSON If ye do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never see ye again . LONNY TUCKER You loved me befo ' that little peacock Cap'n came along . You loved me then . You 'd a-been willin ' fo ' me to fight George Dozier fo ' ye . And it was the Cap'n turned yo ' head and made ye smart . Well , he wo n't plow a furrow fo ' ye . He wo n't sow a patch . He 'll just go traipsing around , shooting at everybody that gits in his way . CHARITY CLARKSON He had to fight . LONNY TUCKER No , he did n't . I been watching him and studying his ways . He fights because he do n't know how a decent body does a thing . He 's foxy and gambly and full o ' loud words just to dissemble that he 's worthless . CHARITY CLARKSON Ye would n't dare to speak yo ' mind to him . LONNY TUCKER If he 'd stand up to me front to front without shootin ' like a rat , I 'd dare . He 's plain trash , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a book , and nothin ' learnt from his mother . And he 's scairt , too . If I walked up to him , just once , he 'd be scairt o ' me. p. 110 CHARITY CLARKSON Lonny LONNY TUCKER Do you know why he puts on his airs and wears his uniform and talks law and duelin ' ? Because he 's a come-on from a patch o ' trash , imitatin ' the big-wigs from the settlements and thinkin ' he 's gentry . If he had blood in him he 'd know more than to come into a tavern insulting strangers . CHARITY CLARKSON I wo n't listen to ye . LONNY TUCKER I 'm sorry , Charity , I would n't say . Only I love ye , and I 'm afraid fo ' ye until he 's shet o ' this neighborhood . A traveling sharper , headin ' in quick fo ' a bad end . And befo ' long he 'll be known fo ' one . CHARITY CLARKSON in anger.You git down that ladder and go home where ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming ' round tonight after what 's happened . LONNY TUCKER retreating and starting down. I 'm a-goin ' . But remember that I 'll wait fo ' you until the end o ' time . CHARITY CLARKSON Instead o ' comfortin ' me , you LONNY TUCKER disappearing.Charity , I meant to comfort you . You 'll know after while . He goes . JACKSON comes out . CHARITY springs to meet him , flaming with anger. p. 111 CHARITY CLARKSON The little white-faced coward , creepin ' around here after hit 's all over to talk ag'in your back . I thought I 'd have to call you out and let you skeer him , befo ' I could run him down . I 'll never speak to him again so long 's I live . To think that he should say such things about a gentleman like you ! CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON quizzically.Would n't you allow that he told the gospel , ma'am ? CHARITY CLARKSON snatching up the denial.Gospel ! His saying that you are afraid Why , you ai n't scairt o ' the whole kit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid o ' the whole world . And ye 're the finest gentleman God A'mighty ever made . He never saw gentry like you . So mannerly and perlite . Why , no one could have been mo'kinder or sweeter than you have been . To say that you picked a quarrel I guess a body has to defend himself if a whole pot-house o ' scoundrels come bearin ' down on a body like they did on you . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON with quiet prideI 'm afraid I picked that fight . CHARITY CLARKSON with immense pride.Of cose you picked it . Why , they wo n't never be a time when you wo n't pick yo ' fights and carry ' em where you want to , when you see a body o ' men bearin ' down on ye ! That 's what made me love you so , standing there carrying it back to ' em when they throwed it up to you . So cool and calm , and not scairt even a little bit . Why , I guess that boy do n't know real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ; I knowed you , and I knowed I wanted you . p. 112 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON Now , Charity , you allowed yourself that I was scared . I reckon there was a world o ' truth in what that boy said . I do n't know any law . I was sent out here because they could n't find any other lawyer who 'd be risky enough to come . And that hoss and that dog and that pen o ' game cocks Why , I won ' em at Jonesboro on a cock main , and like as not I 'll lose ' em along with that nigger when I git to Nashville . I only won that nigger ten days ago . Sadly . And I have shot several men . CHARITY CLARKSON I do n't care . Cose you have . Why , I ' low ye 've done ever'thing a man ought to do . I ' low I love ye a heap mo ' for it . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I allow I 'll get kilt myself before long . And if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . CHARITY CLARKSON I do n't care . I love you . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON wistfully.I 'd admire fo ' you to give me one o ' those heart-leaves there in that chist . CHARITY CLARKSON What would ye want with it ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON So 's to shet up hope in a chist . CHARITY CLARKSON What chist ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON tapping his breast.Here. p. 113 CHARITY CLARKSON Maybe ye 'll take all my hope away with ye . But maybe ye 'll bring it all back again , when April 's come and cote 's over . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON When I came tonight I ' lowed I 'd take it all away , but I kai n't . CHARITY CLARKSON Ye 're mighty pallid . Are ye bleedin ' ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON My heart 's bleeding fo ' you , after what I 've done . CHARITY CLARKSON Putting the leaf in his breast.Then hit will be powerful healin ' , if ye 'll only put faith in it . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON touching her arm.Then I 'll put faith on it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . CHARITY CLARKSON I vow something did happen . She kisses him fiercely . There , kin ye fetch it to your memory ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON broken.Po ' little pink foot Arms around her . CHARITY CLARKSON holding close.When spring comes will ye be ridin ' through ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I never came back to any place I ever was . p. 114 CHARITY CLARKSON Then ye wo n't leave for if I let ye leave , there wo n't never be anything like ye again . And I 'll live to be old , and ye 'll be the one thing I 've wanted , and I wo n't have never had you . Ye 're swayin ' tired . She leads him to the chest.Ye 're that weary . They sit . He puts his head on her breast . Kin ye hear my heart pumpin ' fo ' ye ? CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON blind.I kai n't hear it . What does it say ? CHARITY CLARKSON Sho , now , it says : Stay here with me ; where have ye been so far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by ; why must ye leave me so soon CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I kai n't go away from here tonight if ye talk that way . CHARITY CLARKSON on chest , he leaning over.No , ye kai n't . When a body belongs to another as I belong to you a body does n't care fo ' nothin ' else . They are poised a moment , then he breaks away and stands . CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON I fooled ' em all pretending I was brave . I was going to cheat you last . CHARITY CLARKSON I would n't care . I would n't care . p. 115 CAPTAIN ANDY JACKSON who has n't the nerve to take the girl , and who therefore mouths a moral sentiment as an excuse for running away.But I 'm at the loose end o ' cheatin ' . And if I leave ye now , ye 'll belong to me always above me white and shinin ' forever . Goodbye , Charity . CHARITY CLARKSON Goodbye . She sobs.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
