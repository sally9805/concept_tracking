txt A. shrewd and intelligent roan who served two terms in the House of Representatives was once heard to protest against the common and sometimes bitter criticism of the intellectual quality of the members of Congress . He had found them quite above the average in both ability and character . Many of them were men who would //lake their mark anywhere . Individually they were industrious , highminded and capable of broad and Patriotic views . But he admitted that in their collective  --  capacity they were often surprisingly driven like so many sheep into the most foolish actions conceivable . Personally and in private relations , right-thinking and brave , they would , as a. body , under party pressure , or through a kind of moral intimidation brought to bear upon them from their home States , hear themselves and legislate in the most unreasonable and cowardly fashion . This explanation lies not far from the root of the ordinary complaints about Congress and of the prevalent distrust of its work . Congress ought to be a popular body . It goes to Washington as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly unpopular  --  perhaps growingly so . This is not the result Of disrespect for individual Representatives or Senators . Whether Congress has fallen below its former level of brains and moral fibre It is idle to dispute . There is no way of proving the case conclusively , one way or the other . But hope springs eternal in the breast of democracy , and with the coming of a new Congress there is usually a pleasing anticipation that the mistakes and offenses of the old one will not be repeated . First impressions count for much with Congresses as well as with persons ; so that a great deal will depend on the way in which Representatives and Senators at Washington settle down to do the public business . In the House the auspices are favorable . The new Speaker , Mr. LONGWORTH , is both experienced and high in favor personally . It is evident that he plans to be something of a party leader as well as a presiding officer , thus heading back toward the older theory and practice of the Speakership . Mr. LONGWORTE believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemingly hopes to weld the Republican majority , with the Western Insurgents well outside the breastworks , into an efficient instrument of legislation and government by party . With commendable promptness , the new tam bill has been made ready and Will speedily pass the House . To the Senate one can not turn with SO lively a hope of seeing vigor and dispatch in the work laid upon Congress . There is still talk , quite apart from the belligerent proposals of Vice President Dawes  --  which the Senate committee will doubtless bury deep in some particularly dusty pigeon-holeof changes in the Senate rules so as , to expedite debate and bring questions to a vote . A searching test of the Senate 's real ability ' to do business will come in its disposal or the bill - providing for our entrance into the ; World Court . By previous agreement this will be taken up in ten days . It is known that all but eight- or nine Senators are in favor of the measure . But the minority is reported to be as stubborn as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over weeks and possibly months . All that can be said is that if the Senate submits to that , it will submit- to- anything . It would by such a course show to the country that it was without not only rules but ordinary self-respect .
