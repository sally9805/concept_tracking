txt ISIIISSOLINI 's dramatic offer to Change the electoral law which he himself put through in order to insure a Parliamentary majority for the FasCitilti is the latest move in a defensive battle which has now been going on for six months . Ever since the disappearance of the Socialist Deputy MATTEOTTI in June and the later proof of the fact that he had been murdered at the behest of men high up among the Ve-scisti. the political atmosphere in Italy has been charged with high explosives . Mussotarit has brought Into play all the - weapons in his amply stored armory . He has been conciliatory , aggressive , apologetic , defiant , straightforward and canny . His offer to go once more before the people  --  for that would seem to be implied in a revision of the electoral law iseesee the Opposition worried . Is It surrender or is it strategy ? One factor that operates against 7Siossourri is the very argument that Under Fascist rule Italy has made notable progress toward , order and prosperity . The Opposition wants to know If the time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cept in Russia the forces of normal life are reasserting themselves . Pub= lie opinion in Italy is obviously restive under the implication that more than six years after the armistice the Italian people must be ruled on a war basis . It is a war regime in more than one sense . The Fascist philosophy , expressly or by implication , asserts a continued state of civil war between those who would preserve Italy and those who would " destroy " her . Anti-Fascism is defined as antinationalism . In their fervent ceremonials the Fascisti have the habit of describing Italy , Rome and the People as synonymous with " us . " This claim to a monopoly in patriotism is all the more galling because , of the revelations of Fascist methods for maintaining their power . Demands in Parliament for bringing to trial Fa3-cist leaders guilty of violence and grant oppression have met with the assertion that these practices were excusable as part of a " revolution .

The fact that the same methods of violence which two years ago were employed against Communists are now invoked against " dissident " Fascisti reveals a rift within the party itself . It is the inevitable otri.eq-ne - of the dictatorship method , for whic ; ? y-e have a parallel in the present factional struggle in Russia .
