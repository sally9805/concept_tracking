The Council of the League of Nations sat-for the 49th time-at Geneva , last week . Seldom have Great Powers been more thoroughly flouted by Minor Nations than during the proceedings which ensued . The Powers were represented , of course , by the Big Five : 1 ) Sir Austen Chamberlain ( Britain ) , supercilious to correspondents but ready with a queer , cackling laugh for his colleagues ; 2 ) Monsieur Aristide Briand ( France ) , tousled and heavy eyed as a tomcat at dawn ; 3 ) Dr. Gustav Stresemann ( Germany ) , plump , bald , rubicund , and yet with a trig , indefinable air of smartness ; 4 ) Signor Vittorio Scialoja ( Italy ) , representing with compact , bustling decisiveness the great Duce ; 5 ) Baron Adachi ( Japan ) , frail , insignificant in stature , piping voiced , yet with a winning and decisive mien . <P> As a ludicrous prelude , the Chairmanship of the Council passed by alphabetical rotation , last week , from a Chinaman* to a bronze-hued if not red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Prime Minister Augustine Valdemaras of Lithuania , requesting him to appear before it and explain why he has not permitted steps to be taken toward easing the perpetual Lithuano-Polish crisis in accordance with the plan approved by the Council when it last sat ( TIME , Dec. 19 ) . <P> Dictator Valdemaras promptly wired back his refusal to come and explain . Matter postponed indefinitely . <P> The Council took up once more the five-year-old Transylvanian land dispute between Rumania and Hungary . Just as some progress seemed about to be made , last week , Rumanian Foreign Minister Nicholas Titulescu burst into tears , and threatened to withdraw if pressed to make concessions . Matter postponed to the 50th Council session next June . <P> The grave question of violation of the Treaty of Trianon by recent smugglery of Italian arms into Hungary ( TIME , March 5 ) was referred by the Council , last week , to a committee consisting of a Finn , a Chilean and a Dutchman . <P> When they recommended that a civilian commission should investigate the shipping of the machine guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hungary ) the Council accepted this recommendation and hailed it as confirming in principle the League 's right to investigate such matters-a right which Hungary had challenged . <P> The Council authorized Secretary General Sir Eric Drummond to let contracts for a new $4,000,000 League Secretariat building at Geneva . This authorization appeared to definitely spike proposals to transfer the seat of the League to Vienna . <P> An official invitation was despatched to Spain and Brazil , requesting those governments to reconsider and withdraw the notice which they gave in 1926 of an intention to withdraw from League membership this year . <P> That Spain will withdraw her withdrawal is considered certain , but the attitude of the Brazilian Government is still unclear . <P> <P> * His Excellency Tcheng Loh , the Chinese Minister to France . <P> +Dr . Francesco Jose Urrutia , Colombian Delegate to the League .
