A shot scared Mrs. Mildred Stevens Morf , 27 , of Brooklyn , N. Y. In the next room , she learned , a housepainter had mortally shot his brother , Herman Goldenberg , dentist . Mrs. Morf fainted . Taken home , she did not revive ; would not speak or eat . Last week she died , from acute hysteria . <P> A subway accident at Times Square , Manhattan , last week , killed 16 people , mangled dozens more . Mrs. Jennie Lockridge , 56 , onetime actress , heard the horror , saw the shambles , became hysterical . Four days later she was dead . <P> Hysteria , trickiest of psychopathic states , is an escape from reality , from conflict . Mrs. Morf it protected from the horror of nearby murder . For her it was too thorough . Others it protects from scolding , from efforts . Sometimes hysteria comes on involuntarily ; often the man , woman or child ( having observed its value ) willfully scurries into it ; more often the person tries to fight off an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> A slap in the face or other physical insult will occasionally stop a hysteric fit . But such are dangerous to many victims . Their hysteria is too deeply ground in character , in brain , in nerves . The deep hysteric may pretend practically every disease , every deformity known to medicine . Some women want children so badly that they actually become bloated . The stigmata frequently reported seen on religious exaltes are hysteric in origin . If the hysteric 's malingering continues long the simulated infirmity may cause actual disease . Only the wiliest of doctors can discern the hysteric 's true state . And only the most patient can cure him .
