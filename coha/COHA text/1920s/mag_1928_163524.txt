Many a U. S. theatregoer thinks of Miss Marilyn Miller as a pair of pirouetting toes plus a face as fresh &; frank as a buttercup . Contrarily , in France , it is the frankness of her tongue that is remembered , resented . Last summer she declared , " Paris is the easiest place in the world to get a divorce-better even than Reno ! " Last autumn she got herself a Versailles divorce from Cinemactor Jack Pickford . The result was that when tidings of her frank flippancy , and that of other U. S. divorce seekers in Paris , reached the ears of staid , august Minister of Justice Louis Barthou , onetime ( 1913 ) Premier , he issued certain drastic orders . <P> Today the French courts obey their new instructions and have tightened up their recent laxity in granting divorces to foreigners . The first notable test case under the new regime came up , last week , when onetime ( 1920-21 ) U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby sought to obtain a divorce at Versailles . Rich , potent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his case that most distinguished of avocats onetime ( 1920-24 ) President of France Alexandre Millerand . <P> As presented by Lawyer Millerand the case of Lawyer Colby was indeed touching . He had , it seemed , " suffered agonies from the capricious treatment " of Mrs. Colby . She was represented as a " fantastic novelist " who had ridiculed in her works both Mr. Colby and the late Warren Gamaliel Harding . Cried M. Millerand , " she has driven her husband to seek refuge in France , here to obtain freedom and the opportunity to begin a new life ! " <P> Coldly the Court considered . Meticulously it ruled : " . . . Whereas , the French tribunals are in principle incompetent of acknowledging divorces between foreigners ; and whereas it does not appear that M. Colby moved his domicile to France but that he inhabits in fact a house placed at his disposal by a friend . . . for these reasons this tribunal declares itself incompetent . " <P> Thus by insistence upon the letter of the law , in obedience to Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the case of a U. S. citizen of first prominence . In Manhattan his wife , the onetime Miss Nathalie Sedgwick remarked , " Poor Bainbridge ! He never seems to get what he wants ! " In more decorous mood , Mrs. Colby has said that Mr. Colby is " far too colossal a figure " to have been encompassed by any of her novels .
