U. S. gentlemen rove abroad to dig with native muckers for pieces of old civilizations . The pieces go into museums , where historians patch up history 's gaps , where the populace gapes a holiday , where eager young women copy decorations for the gewgaws of applied art . Finders , keepers and users they all are . <P> In Egypt . Cheops , builder of the Great Pyramid , 4,800 years ago was the first great Pharaoh of Egypt . Harvard men under Dr. George A. Reisner have put together much history of his line . His father was Snefru , his mother Hetep-Heres I. Cheops loved her greatly . When her first tomb at Dahshur was robbed , he secretly reburied her at Giza , close to his pyramid . Cheops had four queens and several children . One of these , Chephren , built the second pyramid . His doughtiest daughter was Hetep-Heres II , a biological curiosity . Other Egyptians were swart and black-haired . She was blonde with reddish hair , probably inherited from foreign ancestors on her mother 's side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He died . She married another brother , Radedef . He died . For her third husband she took Ankh-ha-ef , a nobleman outside the family . By Kawa'ab she bore Meresankh III , who grew up to be a small , black-haired woman . Hetep-Heres II also outlived and buried her daughter . It was Meresankh Ill 's tomb that Dr. Reisner 's party recently discovered . Pictures and inscriptions therein related the family 's affairs and filled a long gap in Egypt 's dynastic history . <P> As humanly interesting was Professor Breasted 's Luxor Expedition discovery of what seems to have been the private apartment of Rameses III . A large hall contained a dais for his throne . Adjoining was his bedroom with private bath . Alongside his was his queen 's suite , and three rooms with private baths for his concubines . <P> Tethmosis III quarreled with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut over her doings in her temple at Dier el Bahri ( Thebes ) . Angry Tethmosis took all the temple statues , smashed them to bits , threw the debris into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some into the original shapes . <P> In Palestine . Whenever an archaeologist digs up something ancient in Palestine there is joy , whether the object corroborates a Biblical story or whether it indicates a pre-history which the Biblical reporters knew nothing of . <P> At Beth-Shemesh , Dr. Elihu Grant of Haverford College has found jugs and vases which represent a bronze age culture . <P> At Beisan , Alan Rowe of the University of Pennsylvania found drain pipes , a grist mill , a circular silo , all indicating a busy city life 3,200 years ago . Pagan temples , tools , utensils , seals and jewelry were signs of Beisan 's wealth . It was of such civilization that Jeremiah complained : Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem ? The children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead the dough , to make cakes to the queen of heaven Ashtoreth , and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me God to anger. - Book of Jeremiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American School of Archaeology has found Kirjath Sepher , which the Israelites captured in the time of Joshua . Interesting are the remains of a wool-dyeing factory , a small household altar of Samuel 's time .
