Many , many years ago , before the two deadly products of the White Man-fire-arms and fire-water-had dispossessed the Indian from his native soil , the Red Men , in what is now New Hampshire , frequently visited the Place of the Swift Waters , and particularly one portion of those waters known as the High Place for Fish . In the Indian language , Place of the Swift Waters was Merru-asquam-ack , and High Place for Fish was Namos-kee-et . The Whites translated the former into Merrimac and the latter into Amoskeag . So when , along in 1831 , a big cotton mill was built in the High Place for Fish along the Place of the Swift Waters , the cotton mill was named Amoskeag Manufacturing Co. , and was located on the Merrimac River .

The report showed a loss from operations of $960,698 . Among expenses were some $860,000 interest on bonds , $700,000 local taxes , $1,000,000 repairs , $337,000 for new machinery , $95,000 for moving machinery from Fitchburg to Manchester . Other items were bad debts and outlay for printing new securities . " Making up the income account in the way prescribed by the government , " said the report , " the result of the year 's operations is a net loss before depreciation of $583,000 , and , in addition , there is a charge of $1,139,412 for depreciation .
