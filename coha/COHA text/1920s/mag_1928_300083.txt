Two fiery crosses burned in Montana as Nominee Smith passed through , yet Montana 's Senator Walsh , too , is a Roman Catholic . . . . Montana 's Senator Burton Kendall Wheeler , number-two-man of the Progressive ( LaFollette ) ticket in 1924 , travelled with the Nominee on the train , energetic , cordial . . . . Some Montana Indians replaced the Brown Derby with eagle feathers and named the wearer Chief Leading Star . They daubed his face with warpaint . . . . . . . The Sioux of North Dakota produced another headdress and the Happy Warrior became Chief Charging Hawk Leading Star Alfred Emanuel Governor Smith , Sachem of St. Tammany 's Society . ... He played checkers with an Irishman in the Veterans ' Hospital near Fort Snelling , Minn . He won . . . . He complained : " I ca n't fight hard enough ! I want to fight but how can I fight when my opponent Nominee Hoover wo n't fight ? " ... It was also the week of that classic political utterance : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Hill , Board Chairman of the Great Northern Railroad and son of its founder , the late , great James J. Hill , jumped for joy and led cheers on the Smith platform in St. Paul . . . . Senator Shipstead , the duck-hunting dentist , the Farmer Laborite , was friendly-and then reported " hurt , " " alienated . " . . . Milwaukee went wild over the prospect of hearing its beer signs creak again . . . . Nominee Smith went on home . <P> So many conflicting reports reached the Smith special on its way East that only the Cause could be kept clearly in mind . The cause was : to win the progressive vote that LaFollette got in 1924 . The effect that the Nominee had made in Middle America was inscrutably scrambled . <P> There was , to begin with , hollow-cheeked , insurgent Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska , where the trip started . He it is who is supposed to guard the Progressive mantle of the late , great LaFollette . The Omaha speech on farm relief received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , Senator Norris said : " ... Great ! . . . We 're up against the greatest monopoly , the greatest attempt at control of great resources , ever undertaken since the days of Jesus Christ ! " The Omaha World-Herald , daily newspaper of the Brown Derby 's advisor , onetime Senator Gilbert M. Hitchcock of Nebraska , had a " scoop " to the effect that Senator Norris would jump unequivocally for Smith , with a nationwide radio hookup for the occasion . <P> In North Dakota , Walter Haddock , the Non-Partisan who became Governor last month when Republican Governor Arthur Gustav Sorlie died , received Nominee Smith at Bismarck ( the capital ) , shook the Smith hand , rode on the Smith Special . But he would only say that 80% of the North Dakota farmers were for Smith and that he ( Maddock ) was for the farmers . Friends said Governor Maddock was being careful for Nominee Smith 's sake because he , too , is a Roman Catholic . Others said : " Maddock is out for himself only . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
