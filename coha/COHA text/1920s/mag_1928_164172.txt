Charles II , King of England , rode horses in the races at Newmarket : in sporting bars , there are prints that show him leaning back on a lanky thoroughbred , leading the field across a wide and rumpled turf . George IV , when he was Prince of Wales and later during his regency until he began to put on too much weight , rode his thoroughbreds against gentlemen who knew him too well not to pull their mounts when they galloped into the stretch . Last week , for the first time in a century , a prince of England rode to the barrier for a regular race , * the Wallop Selling Plate , one mile , for amateur jockeys , $1,000 . <P> The Duke of Gloucester , Captain of the loth Hussars , who is the king 's third son , Prince Henry , paraded to the barrier on Jehu , + a tall gelding which belonged to his friend , Capt . E. A. Elgee . A fairly large gallery cheered when the Hussar Duke got off to a clever start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half behind Aquilon , last year 's winner . The Hussar Duke urged his horse , stooping in his stirrups , but Jehu was tired . Aquilon finished first , Mr. Polly second , Jehu third . Bookmakers made money , but several of the Duke 's friends , officers of the loth Hussars , lost more than they could afford . <P> It is not recorded that the Hussar Duke , before riding his race , asked the blessing of the Rev. J. H. Davies , Vicar of Westley Waterless , near Newmarket , who last fortnight said : " I am the chaplain to the King 's Horses and the King 's Stablemen . . . before the ' Guineas ' I asked God 's blessing on the stables . ... In answer to my supplication or by Chance , the horse won . . . . " <P> <P> * The Prince of Wales , a poorer horseman than his brother , has , as everyone knows , ridden point-to-point races , not recognized under Jockey Club rules . <P> + " . . . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nimshi ; for he driveth furiously . " -2 Kings IX . 20.
