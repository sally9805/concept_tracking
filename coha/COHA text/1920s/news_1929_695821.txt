txt One or two of the more enterprising political correspondents are able to give you the Hoover Cabinet entire . They use a process of deduction that ' ought to be the envy of detectives or the writers of mystery stories . Starting from the fact that Mr. HoovER went to Washington to select his Cabinet , they infer that he must have chosen all the members 3f it while there . He himself has not said who even one of them is to be , but that does . not matter . We know with whom he talked . We know who has been most talked about . Putting this two and two together makes it easy to add up to the Cabinet ten . Do you ask , for example , who is to be Secretary of State ? We arrive at the answer by a little elimination . Three men have been mentioned  --  HOUGHTON , FLETCHER and MORROW . But it is Mr. MORROW who has scored highest in possible percentages of " mention . " Therefore he is to be the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole Cabinet is made while you wait . Unfortunately for the man who has to construct a Cabinet , he can not employ these intuitive methods . He has to decide what sort of man he wishes to have what portfolio , and then discover him if he can and persuade him to accept . Here is where the true question of eligibility comes in . It has to do not with any candidate 's political credentials ; not with the particular part of the country where he lives ; not with his ability to swing votes or placate hostilities , but with his proved fitness to do the kind of work which the country needs and the President expects . Unless ail the indexes to the character of Mr. HOOVER are at fault , he will consider it the essential thing in making his Cabinet to find in every case as nearly as possible the right man for the job . We should suppose that he would give especially close attention , for example , to the Department of Justice . That it greatly needs an infusion of vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lawyers still feel grieved and sore over what happened under Attorney General DAUGHERTY . President HARDING was duly advised of the high importance of choosing as head . of the Department of Justice a lawyer of approved standing and competence as well as of unchallenged personal integrity . It was said at the time in private by a Justice of the Supreme Court that the appointment of an able and upright Attorney . General might mean , in all the post-war settlements of litigation , a saving of millions of dollars to the United States Treasury . But we remember with shame what happened . A fourth-rate lawyer , known mainly as a party wire-puller , and who was afterward indicted and tried for corrupt acts , was made Attorney General . While the resultant demoralization of the Department of Justice has been , in a measure , made good , the demand still exists for an Attorney General who will command the instant respect of the bar for his learning and professional attainments , and of the country for his demonstrated character . These are the tests which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General . It has been said that he is ingpsia qatlut2 LIONOVAN , This suggested selection has beer violently antagonized because Mt DONOVAN is a Catholic . It has als ( Been opposed because he is reportec to be personally a Wet . Consequent . ly , it is argued that Mr. HOOVE1 would show splendid independency and stamp upon.the , spirit of intoler ante were he to appoint Colone DONOVAN despite these angry pro tests . But such considerations halm really nothing to do with the case The decisive facts should be quite other .

It is a special work which requires special aptitudes . Find Um man who has them in ample degree and it does not matter whether he a Catholic or a Sandemanian , a Wet or a Dry .
