At Angora , President Mustafa Kemal of the Turkish Republic continued his policy of Europeanizing Turkey by holding a dinner-dance in Occidental style . He shattered tradition by insisting that all the women present should remove their veils and join in an old-time Turkish dance with the men . Previously such a proceeding would have been considered sacrilegious , especially as many non-Turks of the foreign diplomatic corps were present . So great is the ascendancy of Mustafa Kemal at present , however , that all the members of his Cabinet and their wives , as well as the leaders of Young Turk society , conformed docilely to his edict . <P> Despatches also announced that hereafter frock coats must be worn by Turkish officials at all government functions . Since the cost of such a garment aggregates nearly $175 in Angora , while the average monthly salary of a Turkish official is about $60 , the Government has instituted special " pay as you wear " credit facilities . <P> A still more sweeping innovation is the recent transference of the Turkish day of rest to coincide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was supposed to be the day on which the first man was born , the day on which he entered paradise , the day of his expulsion , his repentance , his death , and of mankind 's future resurrection . Since the Turks have been abstaining from labor on Friday , the Jews on Saturday and the Christians on Sunday , employers in Turkey have long been resigned to only a four-day full-labor week . It is expected that the Kemalists , haying coerced their own people , will also attempt to fuse the Jews into conformity with the Christian Sunday .
