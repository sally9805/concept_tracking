LIST Tuesday we were wondering how the Burns International Detective Agency likes the new voting machines  --  which are more reliable than ballot boxes and hence require fewer detectives . We recall the occasion , in a certain election district , which shall he numberless , when one faction passed around word that the opposition was up to dirty work , and accordingly fifty Burns men were hired to watch the polls . Almost simultaneously the opposition was tipped off that things were not on the square in the opposing ranks , so fifty more vigilantes were employed . The picture of fifty Burns detectives spying on fifty other Burns detectives all through an election somehow fascinates us , and endears to us this darling democracy . HERE and there about town are small nooks where something civic in the way of a fountain or a grass plot has been attempted . Everybody knows what dismal failures most of these places are , even judged by city standards . The one which caught our glance recently was the pool in front of the Custom House : if ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pool is gray and beaten . Newspapers lie at the bottom and no living thing grows around the edge . Even the statue of Abraham de Peyster has sadly turned his bronze hack on it . Nobody loves it , and that 's what 's the matter with it  --  and with all the other spots like it . If we were Mayor , we would create a new job , gardener extraordinary  --  a man who would possess both the imagination and the authority to transfer a fish from the Aquarium to the pool , and to cultivate  --  with enthusiasm and ardor  --  some green thing there , even if it 's only a rubber plant . I UST as we were about to take the j veil and renounce motion pictures altogether , along comes the Little Carnegie Playhouse , a new movie theatre which has ping-gong tables , a bridge room , a dance floor , and free coffee and cigarettes . We sent a man right over from our Hoopla Department , and he reported that not only is the ping-pong room done in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that you can linger there without being coerced into the main auditorium . Therefore it is now possible to go to the movies without either seeing or hearing the film , which is unquestionably the biggest step forward the industry has ever taken . WE view with alarm a condition which exists in night clubs and grillrooms . The proprietors of these places have made it a rule not to admit anyone who ooks like a college boy  --  particularly on the Saturday nights following football games . The reason is that the collegians , although possessed of a great love of life , usually have n't enough money to cover the check . We learned about all this through a friend of ours who was kept out of the Club Malaga the other night because he had on a coonskin coat . We have no regrets on his account , but what about the youngsters from Yale and Rutgers and Dartmouth and Tech , who are really sincere about their frivolity ? Where are they going to learn about life if night clubs shut their doors against them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer work . Even if you know just which necktie you want and have the exact change in your hand , the store does n't work , and you are detained about ten minutes while the various departments send radiograms hack and forth , notifying each other that there is a man in the store buying a necktie . The fact of the matter is , we do n't care whether department stores work or not because they are so beautiful and have such beautiful and distinguished people to wait on you . Probably the most select salesperson we have encountered is a girl in Best 's who works in the juvenile-hat department for twenty-five dollars a week and lives at the Plaza with her mother . The Omnibus N our discussion last week of the 1 . Opera 's boxholders , we made no mention of the omnibus box , which NOVEHDER , 10 , 1928 secretary-treasurer . Only three honorary members have ever been taken in : Albert Morris Bagby , of the Morning Musicales ; Antonio Scotti , beloved veteran of the opera company ; and Signor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no gentleman shall occupy a front chair in the omnibus for more than one act . The absence of white gloves is deplored , and a campaign is on to make them de rigueur , as they were before the war . ? has a more lively , if less formidable , tradition than the diamond horseshoe . The omnibus box is that oversized affair , familiar to all opera-goers , at the extreme left of the grand tier . It was the outgrowth , indirectly , of a fire in 1890 which destroyed the whole stage of the Metropolitan except for the narrow curving area between the footlights and the curtain , called the apron . All opera performances had to he abandoned , but the strip of platform and the seating space which were left untouched set a group of gentlemen to thinking . Among the leading thinkers were Mr Reginald DeKoven and Mr. Jimmie Otis , and before Iong they hit upon an idea , and formed the Vaudeville Club , for which they rented a large part of the grand tier , and persuaded actors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shows dosed , to entertain the club . Midnight meetings were held all winter . Such eminent stars as John Drew appeared . Sometimes the whole cast of a play at Daly 's would repeat their performance for the club . The membership grew to fifteen hundred . Gentlemen who had dozed off during the operas were lively and gay long past their bedtime . This went on for several seasons ; ? it continued even after the stage had been rebuilt and opera resumed . After the third year , however , the Metropolitan authorities decided that the opera-and-vaudeville combination was not any too dignified , and so the midnight shows were done away with . The club was continued and exists today as the Metropolitan Opera Club , having been so incorporated in 1899 . The club 's grand-tier holdings were restricted about that time to several adjoining boxes , and permission was granted to remove the partitions between these boxes . The result was the omnibus . The club also had leased , and still holds , its own private lounge and meeting-room off the foyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-one seats , most of them in the omnibus . Membership entitles one to attend the Monday , Wednesday , and Friday night performances , and the Saturday matinees . At the matinees ladies are invited to sit in the large box , and to take tea in the club lounge , where an excellent caterer is on duty . The officers of the club have remained unchanged for more than twenty years ; they are : Richard Anthony Strong , president ; Alfred R. Whitney , vice-president ; and Frederic Potts Moore , Little Accident ASTORY about a mishap to the Zeppelin when it was at Lakehurst is just getting around . During the course of repairs to the ship , a workman , high up on the top of the great bag , was moving cautiously about , using a flashlight , when he let it slip and fall . It ripped through the-fabric of the dirigible and released about three thousand dollars ' worth of gas . Captain Eckcner and the rest of the crew tried to hush up any talk about the accident  --  there were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager of the National Carbon , the company which had manufactured the light , could n't keep it quiet . For it seems that that flashlight , in spite of its crashing fall , still works . The official keeps the battered thing on his desk and snaps it on and off for people all day . A-100 THE ruddy little Irish lady whom you may have noticed riding about town in a large enclosed car bearing the license plates A-I00 is Mrs. Annie Linke . As might he suspected from that low , easily remembered automobile license number , Mrs. Linke is a person of some influence in town . Born in Ireland , she came here when quite young , to find that a number of her male relatives who had preceded her had become politicians of no little consequence . Later , she served as nurse to the children of many old New York families , and thus today she holds the strategic position of being able to call certain gran &; dames by their first names and to hail important public men as Mike . Annic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the prominent families she used to work for knocks down a policeman in a spirit of jest , it is Annie who fixes things up . She speaks the language of the cop and she also knows the mind of the other side of the threatened legal action . More than once she has arranged settlements out of court  --  to the relief of worried fathers and harmed judges . In the course of such mediations Annie has come to know familiarly virtually all the city and county officials . Cops salute her as A-100 rides by , and she is herself a deputy sheriff of this county and carries her badge in her handbag . ANNIE LINKE 'S automobile is a symbol of her business success . The families she used to work for gave her old things for which they had no use , and these she sold , establishing a business out of which she has made an appreciable fortune . She deals in cast-ofF clothing , furniture , works of art , musical instruments , even horses and motor cars . When an old family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linke is more often than not called in to buy its effects . She maintains her offices in rather dim and musty rooms behind the shop of her husband , T. Linke , filters and plumbing , 220 West Forty-sixth Street . Most of the things she now buys and sells she handles through a warehouse , however , for her business has grown to warehouse proportions . She is in and out of her shop all day , motoring in her fine car to the houses of people from whom she buys , taking the portable spoils away with her in the machine . Also she sometimes handles the transfer of businesses , and of real estate . She lives at DougListon , Long Island , in a large house , and owns a lot of property . Her charities arc notable . Although a devout Catholic , she once gave to the Presbyterian church at Douglaston some land which the church needed and could not afford to buy Annie is proud of letters she has from notable people and will show you snapshots of herself taken with famed persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note just received from Paris : A number of eminent Frenchmen have taken to wearing American horn-rimmed spectacles , among them Andr6 Citroen , manufacturer ; Jean Giraudoux , arts and letters ; Jean Rouviere , Youngman-about-town ; also a yellow tomcat in the Boulevard St. Germain who wears horn-rims to advertise a local optician . Such manifestations are expected to bring the two nations gradually closer together . Hohoken Nights MIIE filigreed interior of Chris-1 topher Morley 's theatre in Hoboken looks like the icing of a wedding cake . The curtain is alive with one of those grand old early-twentieth-century groups  --  ladies prone on a flight of steps , cherubs holding garlands of posies . The actors , in the best tradition of stock , stumble cheerfully over unremembered lines and carry on . Balcony seats arc fifty cents . Altogether , the experience makes you a child again , just for one Hoboken night . We attended a premiere there recently , and although the play did n't happen to be a good one , the old thoughts that came rushing back were worth recapturing . Slumming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront , once devoted mainly to deep-sea sailors , beer , and such , now has an added flavor of the drama . In Meyer 's Hotel , in the grillroom of the Continental , in the Hoboken Hofhrau , you find stock company actors , studying next week 's play over a piece of apfel kuchen , and " Just off hand I would qaestioit its age . " you find first-nighters there to see the sights and try the German food . Hudson Street , where the theatre is , is not far north of the vehicular tunnel ; it still boasts Chinese laundries , and in the windows of the pool halls and saloons , partially hidden behind posters of Al Smith , are the dusty relics of the days when the port of Hoboken was a name to conjure with  --  ships in bottles , models of Swiss chalets , rubber plants , toy dachshunds . The theatrical company gives new plays and former Broadway successes . As an organization it is reminiscent of the Three Hours for Lunch Club and flies that Morley banner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often linger after the show for pretzels and beer backstage . Just Dropped In FOR months it has been the habit of a former football player of some note to spend his idle hours at his favorite place of relaxation , one of the larger university clubs . Staying in town for the night , he engaged a room there last Monday evening . After the theatre he entertained friends , and someone , for a lark , threw the furniture all about the room . The next morning a member of the board of governors spoke sternly to the young man , pointing out that he had laid himself open to expulsion . " But you ca n't expel me , " said the disturber . " I 'm not a member of this club . " Game Birds IFyoushouldcome upon a pheasant among your chickens it is probably one that has escaped from some private game preserve around the state . There are scores of such places ; thousands of acres are given over to hunting grounds on Long Island alone . Wealthy sportsmen own many of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore game to this part of the country than any public agency , we are told . IT seems that a new order of sports- ' . men conservationists is springing up . They hire competent gamekeepers  --  most of them Scotchmen with years of experience  --  and give them cane blanche to go ahead and fill their covers with game . One of the best of the game preserves around New York is Marshall Field 's on the north shore of Long Island , about forty miles from the city . Mr. Field has seventeen hundred acres , many of which are given over to hunting grounds . GG ETTING such a place ready for preserving game is not an easy task . The head gamekeeper , an experienced man , has been pretty steadily at the job since he came here from Scotland five years ago . If you have a mile or so of ground , you go about making a game preserve by clearing out spaces for fields and cutting rides through the woods . Traps must then be set to catch vermin , because vermin destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even house cats . On one grounds last year , sixty-eight cats were killed by a game-warden . Corn , millet , and buckwheat are then planted , and the rearing of pheasants , woodcock , grouse , and the like begins . The birds are kept in great pens and are released on the night before , or on the morning of a shooting day . Many released fowl fly over the boundaries and serve to stock neighboring grounds . In four years about eighteen thousand pheasants were reared on the Field estate , of which about eleven thousand were shot . Many are kept in pens for breeding purposes . Those which escape the hunters ' guns used to have an even greater foe in hawks , but thousands of the hawks have been shot or trapped in the past few years and the pheasant is having a chance to increase in the land . All of the game birds are holding their own or growing in numbers , with the exception of the ruffed grouse , which were plentiful thirty years ago on Long Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost finished them off . Adam Scott , one of the ablest gamekeepers in the country , is in charge of the hunting preserve on the estate of Clarence H. Mackay on Gardiner 's Island , near the east end of Long Island . There Mr. Scott rears about six thousand pheasants every year . The grounds also afford waterfowl , woodcock , and deer . The gamekeeper is an expert at destroying vermin , providing protection in other ways for the game , and feeding . Others who have private hunting grounds in New York are Mrs. W. A. Harriman , Bernard M. Baruch , Albert Clayburgh , Mrs. Daniel Guggenheim , Arthur Iselin , Charles L. Lawrance , Robert P. Huntington , Walter Jennings , Edward F. Hutton , Jacob Ruppert , and M. R. Guggenheim . Their efforts , combined with those of the State Conservation Commission , which has prohibited the pursuit of grouse and partridge on public grounds for a year , will soon make the sight of a wandering game bird no novel one to weekending city folk . Cloudy Mind fk . LADY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for abroad next week , suddenly became confused in her own mind as to what ship she was hooked in . It took the French Line 's best talent to straighten her out . She had told friends that she was going to France on the Paris , but it turned out that she was going to Paris on the France . She was still a little confused when last we saw her and had decided to leave the whole matter to an old family butler who used to he a deck steward . This Jury Business WHEN the Municipal l Bu were Building down about at thour taxes last week , we called on Mr. O'Byrne , who is commissioner of jurors , because we have always wanted to get it clear in our minds how jurors are selected . Mr. O'Byrne is a gruff gentleman . What makes him gruff is that it is so hard to get citizens in this town to serve on juries . He told us that it is not hard to get names . It is , in fact , easier now than formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its spirit of Service , has been supplying him with lists of eligible jurors . The chief sources for names , however , are the Social Register , Dau 's Blue Book , club registers , and so on . These are always culled first , and are supplemented later by public records , the phone book , and the city directory . Here are the main facts of the system . The jury year runs from October 1 to June 30 . Lists of eligible jurors are made up in May by Mr. O'Byrne  --  all persons are eligible who have lived in the city the greater part of the time from the preceding October . Two separate lists are kept , the nonvoters ' and the voters ' list . Names are selected for each term of court as it crimes along , each judge informing the commissioner how many names he wishes drawn  --  usually about a hundred . The non-voters ' box is exhausted of its ballots first , as a lesson to people not public-spirited enough to vote . As a matter of fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jurors for a jury year , if one out of every ' two persons drawn did not get excused for some reason or other . A juror is required /6/witt-C to serve twelve days , and this service then exempts him for two years . If you want to be excused , you have to explain your reasons to the judge for whose term of court your name has been drawn . If you are excused , the exemption holds good for only one jury year . There are a few classes of permanently exempted workers : newspaper men , doctors , dentists , clergymen , sailors and soldiers , trainmen ( not on local lines , however ) , pharmacists , veterinarians , teachers , and embalmers . Every year about a hundred men come in voluntarily and offer to serve , thus surprising and greatly pleasing Mr. O'Byrne . Their names are put down , subject to the chance of the draw . No one can serve more than two jury terms in any year , even if he wants to . Few , however , wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to excuses . A curious article of the law specifies that if anyone brings to the commissioner the name of an eligible juror it must he duly entered on the lists . How many informers of this kind there arc , we could not find out  --  hut it seems to he a little-known method of playing a prank on a friend . Whisper HOWEVER tardy he is , Mayor Walker is apparently never without a new excuse . One night last week His Honor appeared about forty-five minutes late at a party at which he was the guest of honor . The hostess for once was faintly reproachful . " Well , " said the Mayor , " I 've got a pretty good precedent . Hoover did n't get around to voting till he was fortythree. "
