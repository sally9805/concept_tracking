In consequence of anti-Japanese utterances in the House and the retention of the Japanese Exclusion feature , Section 12 ( b ) of the Johnson Immigration Bill , Masanao Hanihara , Japanese Ambassador to the U. S. , protested to Secretary of State Hughes . The correspondence was notable as eliciting concrete expression of the famous " Gentlemen 's Agreement , " negotiated by President Roosevelt with the Japanese Government in 1908 , in lieu of specific Japanese exclusion legislation . <P> In an annually outspoken note , the Japanese Ambassador denied the charges that Japan had violated the " Agreement " and declared that Section 12 ( b ) , providing for exclusion , " would not only seriously offend the just pride of a friendly nation . . . but would also seem to involve the question of the good faith , and threfore the honor of their government . . . I have stated all this in a most friendly spirit , for I realize the grave consequences which the enactment of the measure would inevitably bring upon the otherwise happy and beneficial relations between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gentlemen 's Agreement , as stated by Mr. Hanihara and confirmed by Secretary Hughes , are : <P> 1 ) The Japanese Government will not issue passports to the U. S. for laborers , skilled or unskilled , or for their families , unless previously domiciled in the U. S. . The definition of " laborer " is accepted as given by U. S. Executive Order of April 8 , 1907 ; <P> 2 ) Passports are issued by a limited number of officials , under close supervision from the Japanese Foreign Office , and then only after exhaustive investigation ; <P> 3 ) Issuance of passports to so-called " picture-brides " has been stopped by the Japanese Government since March 1 , 1920 ; <P> 4 ) Monthly statistics covering incoming and outgoing Japanese are exchanged ' between ' the American and the Japanese Governments ; <P> 5 ) The agreement does not extend to the Hawaiian Islands , but practically identical measures restrict Japanese passports to these islands ; <P> 6 ) The Japanese Government exercises further control over emigration of Japanese laborers to foreign territories contiguous to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their surreptitious entry into the United States . <P> Secretary Hughes submitted the Hanihara correspondence to Senator Colt , Chairman of the Senate Immigration Committee . Its publication occasioned Senatorial thumpings , and oratorical flurries , including an effort from Senator Shortridge of California , who branded Hanihara 's protest as a " spurious , verbose communication , unfounded on fact , " Ex-Senator Phelan of California issued a statement demanding that the United States rescind the Gentlemen 's Agreement and regulate its own immigration laws rather than delegate this authority to another country . He was supported by the American Legion , the National Grange , the American Federation of Labor , and the Native Sons of the Golden West . <P> Unfortunately for him , the chief effect of Mr. Hanihara 's note was to alienate the Senators who had previously been the best friends of the " Gentlemen 's Agreement .
