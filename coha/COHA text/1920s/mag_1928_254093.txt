Diplomacy . Hitching a galaxy of stars to this antiquated vehicle by Victorien Sardou , George Crouse Tyler surprised Manhattan playgoers by the excellence of his judgment . The play , as translated by Sir Gerald du Maurier , seemed nearly as neat and sparkling as it did on the evening of Queen Victoria 's " command performance , " nearly half a century ago . Surely it was well played . William Faversham , 60 , perhaps stung to effort by the recent and successful theatrical activities of his eldest son William Faversham Jr. , gave an impeccable performance as Henry Beauclerc , the suave ambassador who , by sniffing the scent of a lady 's handkerchief , regains important documents of state . <P> Margaret Anglin , 52 , as a lady of wit and leisure , indulged herself and the audience with such wisecracks as " Her teeth are like the Ten Commandments-all of them broken . " For once , an all star company seemed as good as the sum of its parts and the play creaked seldom as it rolled rapidly across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 , Cecilia Loftus , 51 , Jacob Ben-Ami , 38 , Rollo Peters , 45 , Helen Gahagan , 27 , Georgette Cohan , 27 . <P> The Grand Street Follies are built upon the eminently sound principle of burlesquing all recent attractions at Manhattan theatres . A sophisticate must loudly giggle , when Albert Carroll comes on the stage impersonating Laurette Taylor or when Dorothy Sands pretends she is Ina Claire , lest neighbors in the audience suffer from the illusion that he has not viewed the original from which the parody derives . Yokels , too , are compelled by their anxious timidity to give deceitful titters . Since almost all Manhattan theatregoers fall painfully into these categories , it was perhaps unnecessary for Albert Carroll and Dorothy Sands to make their burlesques in The Grand Street Follies of 1928 quite so hilariously exact as they did . The former simultaneously played Mrs. Fiske with the right side of his face and Ethel Barrymore with the left ; Dorothy Sands played Mae West in Romeo and Juliet . Other impudent imitations were offered by Paula Trueman who appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes . <P> The customary features of musical shows-such as hordes of pretty , naked ladies and many sentimental songs-are not emphasized in The Grand Street Follies . Mayor Walker , however , without whom no amusement is complete , appears by proxy . There is no plot and the best that could be hunted up in the way of a hero was poor old Trader Horn whose senile and ridiculous maunderings in Manhattan form the framework for little pictures of less decrepit celebrities .
