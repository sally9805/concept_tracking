Thousands of South Australians , * peacefully replete with dinner , tuned their radio sets idly one evening last week to pick up Station 5-CL at Adelaide . A little jazz , they thought , might assist digestion ; and at worst there would be the weather report and a bedtime tale . Suddenly , as Station 5-CL came in on loud speakers and head phones , the digestion of numerous listeners was upset by a shock so powerful that Adam 's apples bounded in male throats and robust women clutched at their hearts . <P> Australia was being invaded by a fleet of hostile airplanes , said Station 5-CL . The planes had just been sighted , pouncing and swooping in from the North . A few moments later the station told that the invading air navy was dropping poison gas bombs , flame throwers , and showers of poisoned darts . For ten minutes the vision of horror and destruction was conjured up with more and more terrifying realism . Then Station 5-CL blandly announced that there was not one word of truth in its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of complaints that the usual features offered by our regular artists have been growing stereotyped and dull . . . . " <P> Those who heard this last announcement chuckled or swore , then retired to a peaceful repose . Not so did hundreds who had not listened to the end , but instead had rushed from their homes , leaped into motor cars , and dashed for remote wooded places where they could hide unnoticed . <P> All night telephone girls answered frantic calls . Policemen and fire brigades scurried out to stop the rush away from cities which might be bombed . Twenty-four hours after the original announcement many families were still in hiding . . . . <P> Australian editors in the vicinity of Adelaide flayed Station 5-CL for this prank . Some observed , however , that " it may teach the nation a much-needed lesson in preparedness . " <P> <P> * South Australia , with a population of 543,122 , ranks fourth most populous among the eight states and territories which comprise the Continent : New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Capital Territory . Although the area of Australia ( 2,974,581 sq . mi. ) is about two-thirds that of the U. S. , the total population ( 5,929,288 ) is only slightly more than that of New York City ( 5,873,366 ) . * Regions North of Australia are : British Siberia ; and the Union of Socialist Soviet Islands ; Japan ; Korea ; China ; Manchuria ; Siberia ; and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics .
