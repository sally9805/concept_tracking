Annually now the Metropolitan Opera Company feeds the public a big human interest story . Three years ago it was Sopranos Marion Talley and Mary Lewis . Last year it was Soprano Grace Moore . All were " poor girls " who had their dreams , worked hard , lived right . This year so far honors go to Soprano Clara Jacobo , 28 , daughter of an Italian grocer , who made her debut last week in Il Trovatore . <P> The Story . A little girl sat in the gallery at a Tetrazzini concert , her black pigtails rigid with excitement . The colossal colorature took her finale with a flourish , kissed her hands to her public , tossed back its flowers , and the little girl sat spellbound . When she arrived home ( Lawrence , Mass. ) finally she made a very serious announcement , that she too would become a great singer . The grocer father took no notice . There were seven other Jacobos to feed . Why should little Clara get such notions ? But she kept her dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a textile mill , nights in a store , saved every penny until , with what she earned singing in the Holy Rosary Church choir and what her mother could give her secretly , there was enough to pay her passage to Italy . Then Angelo Jacobo relented , sold the store , gave his all . So did the brothers and sisters , but the mother who had sympathized first died her first year away , left a saddened Clara to study doggedly for eight years in Milan . <P> Four years ago it was a full-blown opera singer who came back to the U.S. , got an engagement with the Boston Opera Company , later with the San Carlo . Last week came her great triumph when she made her debut in a leading role at the Metropolitan . Papa Angelo was there , wiping away proud tears , and Mayor Michael Landers of Lawrence , to give the stamp of civic authority . Twelve times the audience called her out in front of the great gold curtains , thundered its applause . Next day a typical story named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden slipper there . " <P> The Singer . Poor girls who work hard , live right , do not always develop into great singers . Marion Talley disappointed . So did Mary Lewis , Grace Moore . But Clara Jacobo promises better things . She has at least , contrary to her predecessors , a mighty voice that fills the far crannies of the opera house . She has had operatic experience , sings and moves with an assurance that projects over the footlights . Her first Leonora quavered occasionally , strayed a bit from the pitch but critics took it all kindly , as part of a debut performance , voted her a useful addition to the Metropolitan roster.
