HE resembled in no particular what ? ever the standard conventional figure of an empire builder . A tall spare sandy person with a toothbrush mustache and a refined persuasive voice , he might have passed for a bond sales ? man , a golf champion , or a painter from Montmartre . He might have called him ? self an author and excited no incredulity . He had neither a projecting jaw nor an air of ruthless belligerence , nor even the cold gray eye of the fictional conqueror of the great open spaces . On the con ? trary he had rather an air of living his life with great enjoyment . The general trend of his communications was that New Granada was rather a lark , so why not come and see it ? He had been there twenty years and spent a good part of it prospecting on horseback and experi ? encing all kinds of hardships from poi ? soned arrows to yellow fever . But of these he said nothing . It was really amusing and he knew a lot of fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introductions . So come ! So the lone tourist was come , and now stood with his friend in front of a very large map of the country and discussed what may be called , without any hyper ? bole , his flight into the interior ? as though he were a dethroned monarch or a president in danger of assassination ! " I 'm afraid you 'll have to fly every ? where , " said the empire builder , as though he were addressing a bird of pas ? sage , as indeed he was . " You see , the river is low , and when that happens it may take you twenty or twenty-five days to reach Giradot . " And he laid the point of his pencil on a round black spot on the Upper Magdalena . " And you simply must see So-and-so and So-and-so and So-and-so . No use coming down here at all if you do n't see them . They know all about the country , much more than I do . " This , it may be mentioned , is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always crediting other men with wonderful knowledge and wisdom , and deprecating his own . " And then , " he went on with great enthusiasm , as though he were not an empire builder at all but a bank teller planning a fishing trip , " and then after you 've been to Bogota and seen Zipa ? quira and NemocOn and Tequendama " ( and several other places with resound ? ing names ) , " it would be simply unthink ? able to go home without having a look at Antioquia . Antioquia is a most marvel ? ous place . Gold ! Why I know a man who 's taken out millions from one small river . You ought to see the railway they 've built all by themselves . Very fine indeed . And platinum ! " No one would have gathered from this burst of optimism and general informa ? tion that he himself had a most exact and intricate knowledge of those small rivers and their auriferous possibilities . Oh dear , no ! He simply enjoyed know ? ing how well all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Medellin . I could fly down to Puerto Berrio from Giradot , and take the train up to Limon , then a motor car over the great Quebra Pass in the Andes to San ? tiago , where another railroad ran down the valley to Medellin . " Wonderful chaps in Medellin . " He would write letters of introduction to them . What those chaps did n't know about Antio ? quia was not worth knowing . But I should have to fly if I were to do it all in the time allowed . So it was planned out , the busy pencil following the lines of rivers and railways , pausing here and there to indicate ranches where So-and-so or So-and-so had located rich mineral deposits , or Someone else was building a railway . " All fine chaps . " They must be seen if possible . Letters would he ready , of course . And it came about very much as that persuasive person desired . The tourist flew . But he regrets that the progress of science does not interest him and he recants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his friends that he would experience none of the sensations of flying , whatever they may be , and his friends were probably right . The sensations were those of anyone pro ? ceeding at high speed along an incred ? ibly high bridge in a comfortable limou ? sine , save when reaching the water pre ? vious to a landing , when the sensations resembled a pitiably weak imitation of a sleeping car being stopped and started in the small hours . Towns became maps and maps became extremely misleading . There was nothing inspiring or heroic about it , and one tourist at , least , after a fine lunch and two bottles of beer and a fat black cigar at the Hotel Magda ? lena at Puerto Berri ? , must confess that he lay back in his seat in the body of that hydroplane as it roared across the summits of the Andes between Honda and Giradot , and slept peacefully until his fellow-passengers , who were ladies of Bogota , became alarmed and woke him up in time for him to realize it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of the night , over a bridge like a cobweb above a shining void , and presently it came down out of that heaven of darkness and speed andwent bumping away past steamers and launches , and mysterious shore-lights winked in a friendly fashion as it came to a stop at a bank of soft mud . For if the truth he an acceptable feature of a traveler 's tale , it must be confessed further that the romance of the flight eluded him . An easy thing is never romantic and mechanical things are usually easy . It might have been romantic if something had failed us and we had toppled from that high ridge of air along which we sped so smoothly into the jungles of the Department of Bolivar . We should have fallen , not only from whatever altitude showed on the gauge , but from a world of schedules and fares at so much per kilo to a region where our own fortitude and resourcefulness would have been our only salvation . We should have had an opportunity of know ? ing one another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a chance for those great protagonists , Love and Hate and Jealousy , to come stealing through the forest to join us . However , possibly to the regret of the reader but not of the tourist , nothing of the sort happened ? save once when a cylinder persisted in missing , having burned out its plugs ? and we descended in a spiral curve , ending with a bump , upon a very hot river , and the ladies , being pious like all the ladies of Bogota , crossed themselves . This may have had a good effect , once new plugs were screwed in , for we rose heavenward with ? out a hitch , all six cylinders hitting with a most comforting crackle . So none of us had any excuse for revealing how de ? spicably incapable he or she could be in an emergency . Quite without shame we resigned everything to the two goggled creatures in the cockpit , whose weird heads we could see dimly through the mica glass of the cabin , talking , as divers at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding each other under their canvas visors with the truculent malevolence of Chibcha idols . All this seems to belong to another world , once we stumble and strive up the steep muddy banks of the river in the darkness and reach the hotel . As indeed it does , for this hot dark city on the Magdalena is the portal by which we pass to the High Plateau , a region so remote from all we in the North can understand that it might be in Mars or some other planet . Perhaps it is . Per ? haps that sleep the tourist took in the air was the result of a magic potion . There was , he remembers , a peculiar look in the barman 's eye in the Hotel Mag ? dalena when he brought that bottle of Cerveza Soledad . Perhaps the landing among those starry lights last night was not Giradot at all , but the jetty of some inter-planetary air line . As the train begins to struggle up the steep slopes of the mountains of Cundinamarca he sees a creature standing by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves like verdant plumage . He looks exactly like an inhabitant of the moon , in the opinion of a fascinated tourist peering from the window of the train . He is at any rate as far from Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street , or the Loop in Chicago as any lunar denizen . It appears , however , that the trav ? eler 's imagination has been getting the better of him . One look at the loco ? motive dragging the long heavy train up these killing grades shows it was made not in Persepolis but in England . It is a huge , chunky , patent affair having a radial bogie , with engines at each end carrying a big boiler between them . There is a hard sharp note to its exhaust that is somehow peculiar to English mountain locomotives . A very large and muscular passenger who is , quite un ? necessarily , reading an American maga ? zine of physical development is good enough to explain that the road is on a yard gauge . He also remarks that we change trains at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When asked why , he assumes a broad grin that aug ? ments the attractiveness of a pleasant enough face , and then rubs the side of his nose . The fact is , he murmurs , as though reluctant to say anything against the place , the fact is the gauge , after Facatativa. is a meter . The tourist sug ? gests that this must be somewhat of a trial to shippers of freight to the capital . An expressive roll of the eyes and shrug of the great shoulders inform the tourist that he has stated a fact of the first mag ? nitude . And this sort of thing is not by any means singular in New Granada . There are no connecting links between any of the fragmentary lines that radiate from cities like Bogota or Medellin , and many of them have had their routes dic ? tated by the exigencies of departmental politics rather than by any sane and com ? prehensive scheme for developing the interior as a homogeneous entity . Here is a ease of a lack of foresight , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the great inland waterway of the country towards the capital , and the government begins to build a line down from the capital to meet the concessionaires , but on a Con ? tinental gauge ! A serious matter when the terminal elevation is nine thousand feet above the sea . It must be admitted the notion returns again to the tourist that he is in some strange region in some other part of our universe , where things are deliberately topsy-turvy , where people solemnly live above the clouds instead of below them , where they arrange things to suit them ? selves rather than sonic distant emperor or board of financiers , where the railways go upstairs and the people sleep on the ground floor , and where having red blood in your body is reckoned as important as having a trunk line with a staggering bond issue . So it seems as we climb higher and higher , though the proposi ? tion is not put to one 's fellow passenger quite so antithetically as it is here . It is an amusing feature of life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien residents to become iden ? tified with even good-natured criticism . Their opinions are generally carefully I sterilized and strained through a series of cautious prepositional sieves . As they are fond of remarking , sotto rocs , " You see , we have to live here . " Which may he true enough , though it never seems to strike Europeans that way when they reach the United States . Indeed , the more alien and the more recent they are , the more resounding is their comment upon North American ideals and meth ? ods . And that too , perhaps , is a char ? acteristic of a topsy-turvy land where foreigners hold their tongues and mind their own business and observe the laws and allow the inhabitants to run things their own way . And here in the blazing sunlight on the mountainside is the humorous point of transfer , Facatativ ? . But one 's memory goes back a few miles to La Esperanza , where we lunched at a bal ? conied restaurant that overlooks the great valley up which we have climbed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twines like a neck ? lace and upon whose roofs we peer down with drowsy repletion as we pass on into huge rolling billows of vapor . We have reached the clouds , and only in fugitive rifts can we see the splendor of the far slopes below us . And we , who were so hot and steamy down there , are shoving up the windows and unstrapping our overcoats from our saddlebags , and look ? ing ' reproachfully towards the indefati ? gable boy who is always opening the door that leads to the restaurant car ahead . And after Facatativa , while we are boring through those tunnels of cool white vapor as through some mountain of fairy alabaster , the train begins to go faster . That desperate bronchitic gasp ? ing one heard from the locomotive as it dragged us so slowly round and round those interminable cuttings is gone . There is a chipper and cheerful racket ahead , and when we stop at a station we roar in in fine style and the brakes are needed to bring us to rest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion twenty-eight hundred meters with ? out even an exclamation point . Soon we are plainly enough on the high plateau ; the horizon is rimmed by great dark peaks but the plain opens before us with jolly farms and country houses and automobiles spinning along a road , and at dusk the domes and towers of Bogota . And then we are in a large , clean , dreary station , nodding preoccupied farewells and agreeing to look in one of these eve ? nings at the Anglo-American Club and have a whisky-and-soda . Outside are cabs and coaches , and one of these takes a very tired tourist through a great many cobbled streets until he comes out at last into a vast square with a cathe ? dral and electric skysigns declaiming the virtues of Somebody 's Beer and Some ? one else 's Soap . Then up the Carrera Septima to the Hotel Regina , where he falls among friends from New York who are most hospitable and very much amused at anybody coming all this way unless business compelled him . It may be asserted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it is in the highest degree com ? forting to discover friends in distant cities , especially above the clouds , the traveler must not depend upon them if he is to extract his own essence from his experiences . It is in the very nature of their affairs of intricate personal ag ? grandizement that they should enter ? tain views the reverse of philosophical . It is not to be expected of them to catch the subtle and elusive qualities of this strange city on the high plateau . They are , with agreeable reservations , very much like those seafarers who sail all over the world and tarry in magic har ? bors and beneath the glittering cupolas of marvelous cities , and come home and say there is nothing in the world to see . They possess admirably incondite minds set upon trade and concessions and golf and the women whose photographs adorn their dressing tables . So the true traveler is grateful to the friends he finds , but goes his own way to catch the place unawares , as it were , and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular traveler 's good fortune to find someone to be an interpreter so exactly resem bling a character in a book that he never ceased to treat him like one , to talk to him as though he had no actual existence beyond the ability to give vague replies that in no way interfered with the trav ? eler 's own critical monologue . That young man , who appeared silently in the courtyard of the hotel whenever he was wanted ? more like a shade than a real human being ? was enormously useful to one who , whatever else he wanted , was not looking for dogmatic and positive opinions . So the bargain was struck , if that verb may be used to describe any ? thing so noiseless and free from collisions as the first conversation . So far from seeking to bargain , this denizen of the world above the clouds conveyed the im ? pression of having wandered for years in a cold and vindictive universe and having at last come to rest in the shadow of one who really did appreciate his shadowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time he could be of service . Having breathed these words into an enraptured ear he vanished through the archway into the Calle Septima . It was on the first evening of the tourist 's stay in Bogota , and almost at the hour of his arrival in that same Calle Septima , that a bomb exploded no more than a block away and killed some well-known person . This highly mysterious affair continued to exercise the minds of the citizens for many days and it may have been the reason why the police , of whom there are more in Bogota than in any other city known to fame , examined the new arrival with so much attention as he went out to take the air . This was the thought that flitted through his mind at the time , together with the whimsical notion that possibly the bomb thrower might have had no murderous motives at all , but was merely endeavor ? ing to evoke some stimulating activity in the city 's ganglia . The criminal as well as his motive remained concealed , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some realnews for a few days . It may reveal something of the character of the Bogo ? tanos when it is said that you can more easily arouse horror than humor in their minds . They are extraordinarily polite , and their hospitality transcends even that of the coast , but their capacity for rollicking laughter and biting satire is easily reached . But there is one matter in which they probably surpass everybody , and that is their relish for ear-splitting and brain-stupefying noises . There is a funeral proceeding we may suppose , as usual ? and the coffin is being borne from the dingy hearse , a vehicle with a thing like a black monkey tree at each corner . The great bells of the Cathedral are raining down cataracts of harsh clamor that echo back from the fa ? ade of the Capitol with redoubled power . The bells of another church next door to the Cathedral take up the tale . Across the square , where a line of taxis stand , one of the drivers is trying out his hurn . He touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound and repeats it allegretto ? Ha-ha-har ! ? ha-ha har This pleases him beyond meas ? ure and he goes on like one bemused with cacophony . He has no intention of ever quitting . He takes his time about it . He leaves his hand on the button and looks about him with an ex ? pression of great good humor while the devilish thing emits an interminable snarl that would send him to jail in , any city north of the Rio Grande . And not a head save that of the lone tourist is turned towards him . These people like it . The chauffeurs see someone three hundred yards ahead who may possibly cross the street . They turn on the horn and keep it shrilling and caterwauling until that person has been lost in the distance behind them . They will halt in front of a building containing a dozen families , and instead of getting out and finding their customer , they will sit and honk for twenty minutes while the sur ? rounding inhabitants listen with un ? moved features . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune sends them a ride in some old car ? the crashing of the axles against the body or the horrible uproar of the horn assailing their ears . Yet this is a passing and intermittent phenomenon compared with the ecclesi ? astical outrages upon the peace and quiet of the place . Bogota is essentially a city of policemen and politicians , but above all , of priests . They come ga ? lumphing down the steep streets to ? wards the Plaza , they haunt the arcades near the palace of the Papal Nuncio , they are on the trolley cars and in auto ? mobiles and in stores . Their churches are at every corner and all these churches have bells which hang in open belfries , and you may stop suddenly in the street , stunned by some almost intoler ? able clangor , and looking up you will see boys standing by the bells ? hammering them with all their might like young fiends at play ! It paralyzes you like a drug and the bludgeoned brain moans for mercy . And the sudden cessation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blunt weapon from the wound . . . . And trolley after trolley goes hurrahing down the narrow street . its bell bang-bang-banging at your ears until it reaches a crossing , where a couple of automobiles take up the cry . At night , however , a silence settles over the city as though the shrewd chill in the air after sunset had sent them all to bed under heavy blankets , for the streets are deserted . Unlike most Latin-American capitals , unlike Buenos Aires , Rio Janeiro , Havana , or even San Jose in Costa Rica , Bogota has no night-life at all , in the sense that degenerate Nor ? dics have in mind when they walk out of the Hotel Inglaterra on the great Plaza and step along the Prado to the Malecon or sit at little tables in the Havana caf ? s and watch the world go by . Nothing like that at all . It may be doubted whether the average citizen of Bogota would comprehend you if you tried to explain your doctrine of urban cheerfulness and sociability . Cosmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too poor : and this may be true , since the indigence of a large part of the population becomes a night ? mare to a sensitive stranger after a few weeks ; and their incredible resignation only makes it worse . However , it is a conventional reply among the wealthy in New Granada that all their troubles flow from a lack of money . You point out the millions of hydro-electric horsepower running to waste daily , and they agree , but say there is no money . You show how a tunnel costing a couple of millions would pay for itself in a few years , and they reply there is no money . You allude to the scandalous condition of the Mag ? dalena , the lack of water costing the country untold sums when a few millions in levees would cure the evil ; and they reiterate there is no money . You draw their attention to the coal and oil and gold that runs in veins of incalculable Value through their country and they shrug and say : " No money . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the causes and conditions of greatness in na ? tions . And while it may explain to su ? perficial folk the disturbing discovery that the capital of the country has not a single caf ? or cabaret where a philo ? sophic traveler can see and be seen , stay ? ing himself with flagons and exchanging amiable comments upon the customs , the women , and the prices of New Gra ? nada , it is not an entirely satisfactory solution of the enigma . This leads one by a pleasant logical course to the Interpreter , who has al ? ready appeared upon the scene . He is a slender young man with a deep , gentle , expiring voice and a self-effacing man ? ner . The notion that he might pose as an inhabitant of a newly discovered planet is attractively fostered by his noiseless movements and complete iso ? lation from the frailties and sophistica ? tions of our sleek and genial culture . On one occasion , which seems to have made no particular impression upon him , he caught a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels have not carried him . Ile speaks English because his grandfather was Eng ? lish , but there is no ex ? ultation in his voice when he mentions it . In fact he is an entire stranger to exultations of any kind ; so it may be true about his Eng ? lish strain . But it can be safely asserted he has never before had the experi ? ence of being cicerone to a philosophic traveler with a passion for inter ? rogation , investigation , and vituperation . He seems stunned by the avalanche of questions that have never arisen in his own mind since he was born ? questions about things he has accepted as laws of God and Nature . He betrays no curiosity about our world at all . His con ? ception of the sea , for exam ? ple , is just water ? a great deal of it , of course , but merely water . To live on a plateau nine thousand feet above the sea and to have one 's horizon blocked by a ring of dark cloud-swathed precipices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gradually , as his visitor goes about with him , making little journeys to ZipaquirA and Nemoecin , a picture of a strange existence comes into view . The key to the prob ? lem of his abstracted air is discovered . He is of what is known in Latin America as 1 " first family . " If you are of first family you are not able to do much or think much or say much , and if you could , it would have no effect upon the vast overwhelming fact of your birth . You are ! The fates may decree that you become too poor to live with ? out working , in which case your family , in some elusive and intricate way , ar ? range that you assist in a genteel occu ? pation that in no sense affronts the dig ? nity of your ancestral pride . You go on being first family . if you are , on the other hand , a scion of a fortunate house , you grow richer and richer and you travel to Europe and North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your education and you will return with a new view of life quite incompre ? hensible to your poorer compatriots . These will respect you and stand by you not because you are rich but because you arc " first family . " And whether you are rich or poor you will be quite unable to imagine yourself marrying any lady who is not of the same august descent . Von CL1. ? No. 903. - 19 Granada is no poor man 's immigration ground , and those who are destined to open up her resources in the future will be trained and able executives . And there is one feature of the fiscal and social intercourse of that country which some of the more truculent salesmen from New York can remember with ad ? vantage ? that the merchant is a good judge of character and is not to be de ? ceived by standardized good-fellowship . And while he may be ignorant of the great world of cement roads and elevated structures and fifty-story office build ? ings , he has a very fine brand of conduct of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , however , is a digression from the Interpreter , who is- not a merchant him ? self but clerks in an office , and is " first family . " Just at present he is not doing very much and has permission to turn an honest and dignified peso by showing a philosophic traveler around BogotA . The latter , busily writing up his notes at a table on the gallery of the court ? yard of the Hotel Regina , is startled by suddenly finding his young gentleman standing by the balustrade as though he had materialized out of the rich golden sunshine pouring over the red roof . He is what we used to call " distingu ? " and his gold-rimmed pince-nez make him seem more like a stage diplomat than an intellectual . He has at all times , save when he is shrinking slightly under the hail of questions inflicted by this strange fellow from beyond the " still-vext Ber ? moothes , " an air of being sunk in a pro ? found but by no means bitter consider ? ation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical co ? nundrums . A faint smile flits across his face at rare intervals as though he saw for a moment , far off among the roseate glamours of his thoughts , a key to the extraordinary hazard that has brought us together . There is some resemblance between him and that pessimistic chauf ? feur whose spirit , once he had got us axle-deep in a morass , sank into a slough of despond . Perhaps the chauffeur wasfirst family too , and the contact with an alien plebian makes them both pensive . So he stands , the fingers of one hand thrust slightly into a trouser-pocket , waiting courteously for eventualities , for the next astonishing remarks of his phil ? osophic traveler . Perhaps he is wonder ? ing what sort of pandemonium and hell ? on-earth that northern country must be if all the natives continually ask ques ? tions and criticize every aspect of one 's daily life . Or perhaps he is wondering whether lie will ever get a chance to go down the great river and over that sea , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at a world of living men . There is , according to his own tale , very little prospect of that . He lives with his mother and four elder sisters in a huge palacio of a place down near the station , and they have three servants because , being first family , they can not possibly do anything of a menial nature . They confine themselves , those five large well-nourished ladies , to piety and good works . This of course cuts well into the salary of a young gentleman clerk , but he would not have it otherwise . When it is pointed out to him that plenty of nice young ladies spring actively aboard trolley cars in the square about seven o'clock of a fine morning and jangle away to work in offices , because his tourist friend has seen them and actu ? ally had words with one of them in one of the offices , the Interpreter agrees in a faint faraway voice , but adds that of course they are not first family . There is something very definite about the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remoteness and meek comportment . It dawns on the tourist that possibly a consciousness of immacu ? late heredity and aristocratic tradition might be rather a fine thing to have , however far outside of his own experi ? ence it lies . Possibly such a conscious ? ness can enable its possessor to weather the gales of adversity with poise and gen ? tleness . Possibly it can make for ade ? quate citizenship and become the foun ? dation of sound character . It is disturb ing after all these years of democratic dither and communistic carousings to find a suspicion creeping into one 's mind that perhaps there is something more desirable than material prosperity and a truculent faith in bank balances . More desirable even than the bright modern aims of that empire builder who seeks to substitute tarred highways for the Ca ? mino Real , golf and Mah Jong for cock ? fighting , and victrolas for marimbus . Not that he would deprecate gentility , but that it seems automatically to evap ? orate when those pushing Costenos and Antioquians begin to rush to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . It is an imponderable and allur ? ing quality and he has it , that quiet young man who takes his derisive and interrogatory employer out along the streets of old Bogota and into the an ? cient salt-mines of Zipaquird . And yet one can not but regret that he is continually in danger of being mis ? taken for a denizen of some other and more fabulous world . He makes an patient , eager , critical yet philosophic traveler want to take him back home and exhibit him as a vestige of a for gotten civilization , discovered hy him ? self on the High Plateau ? a civilization whose dead impose themselves heavily upon the living , whose houses are built like fortresses so that the sunlight beats upon vast blank walls and heavy portals and even love has to shoot his slow-winged darts through dark embrasures . That was the memory he left the trav ? eler each day as he breathed a shy fare ? well and vanished like a wraith in the darkness of the hotel entrance . Most potent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the moun ? tainside where the poor folk live in brown-thatched huts lining steep ravines like wasps on a sunny wall . They are very shy , these barefooted ragged citi ? zens of the Bogota suburbs , and the way they wear their straight black hair all tumbled about their fathomless black eyes evokes more thoughts of stumbling upon a race who have never seen one 's kind before . They run and peep at you as you pass , whereas the metropolitan Bogotanos fix you with a portentous and devouring stare that is fastened upon your retreating back as far as he can dis ? tinguish you in the throng . That stare means ? Who are you and what are you doing here ? Where is your home and why have you left it ? What is your re ? ligion , your political affiliation , your pro ? fession , and your Intelligence Quotient ? And so on . It is the frankest and most undisguised curiosity on earth , and ob ? viously the result . of astonishment at finding someone in the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? familiar . But the shy folk up the mountain run and hide , which is vexing for a tourist who has carried his camera all the way up from Cartagena by air and car and rail . He stalks a party of chil ? dren who are playing prettily by a spring that is supposed to possess miraculous powers . A gaunt priest is seated on the rocks among them and the visitor is cap ? tured with the idyllic serenity of the scene . He wishes to click the shutter . The Interpreter , however , is not san ? guine about this enterprise . He points out apologetically that it might not he approved . Good heavens ! But by whom ? Well . . . the young man looks at the ground and hesitates . He hardly knows how to explain . His companion waves aside the shadowy objection and advances , camera at focus , an amiable smile on his features directed at the nearest child , a girl of fourteen , who sud ? de . stands appalled at the terrible stranger bearing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but chiefly a sense of outrage and exasper ? ation . She turns and flies up the slope . Other children , seeing the oncoming por ? tent , scuttle like crabs out of sight . Those who are nearer the priest cluster about his person and his attention is directed toward the source of the ex ? citement . The stranger smiles and makes pacificatory gestures suggesting the idea of photographing the group . The priest 's features darken and grow stern . His tall form rises to an unex ? pected height as he stands up , and he raises a minatory and embarrassing fin ? ger . There is no doubt about it , the tourist is afraid of that tall , ungainly , and shabby creature up there . A most unusual sensation of being in the wrong , and what is perhaps worse , of having broken some mysterious law of courtesy makes him turn to his interpreter to have the affair explained . But that young gentleman had washed his hands of the business long ago . He was away down the road , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much information concerning the episode . He seemed oppressed by the . whole affair , remarking that it was un ? fortunate . This was not very clear and he remained sunk in a profound reverie as the carriage descended the hill , from which could be seen the domes and Lowers of BogotA , with vistas of those red-tiled roofs glowing like dull ham ? mered bronze in the afternoon sun . The young gentleman stands in the obscurity of the great archway of the hotel and in a voice like the dying away of a wind among the reeds promises to come at the appointed hour to-morrow . He is there , and then suddenly he has vanished without a sound . Somewhere in the city he will be seated in a great chamber with his womenfolk about him . Those ladies still wear black for their father now dead three years agone , and are engrossed in good works . The squat dark servants bring in the modest meal on monogrammed silver , the heritage of ancient days . They sit mostly in silence , noting with serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy mahogany sideboard are the portraits of their grandparents , the Englishman and his patrician bride . Perhaps they will ask their brother what sort of day he has had , and he will give a slight shud ? der and remain silent . They will under ? stand . They will know he has been out in the great world again , enduring the society of those who are not first family and who can never comprehend the obscure agonies of soul their very ex ? istence must occasion to the august beings in whose veins runs the thin and haughty azure stream of unsullied lineage.
