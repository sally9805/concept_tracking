Reports from England revealed that attention had been turned to an educational problem as old as Robin Hood-the schooling of England 's 100,000 or more gypsy children . The Surrey County Council opened a peripatetic school , with a master and mistress , to teach them , besides the three R 's , crafts like basket-weaving , rug-making , woodworking , gardening . The " school house " was pitched in open country near a large gypsy encampment and though attendance was distinctly voluntary , 40 pupils enrolled the first day . <P> England 's gypsy tribes , many of them , are unusual in this respect : unlike the nomadic folk of other countries they are not Romanies* but Englishmen . During famines and plagues and-as in the legendary case of Robin and his merrie men-during political upheavals , poor townsfolk or villagers have taken to the open road , the woods and the fields to scrape , beg or poach a living as best they can . England 's winters are not severe enough to have killed them off . One generation of nomads has spawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you stop at a romantic sylvan encampment in the New Forest and converse with its chief personage-usually a hawk-faced great-grandmother , who will offer you dirty tea and whine for a shilling-you will find that none can remember when any ancestor of the band first " took to woods . " They have no legends . <P> Their language is lowest Cockney , guttural and larded with strange terms of the wayside . Their occupations , when pursued , are raising scrubby ponies ( they milk the mares and sell the foals to tinkers , small farmers , etc. ) ; working intermittently for the Crown , usually at ditch cleaning or road-making ; collecting wild birds ' eggs for city oologists . The women go into the towns in rags , carrying their grubby offspring to excite pity and alms from passing motorists . The men , for the most part , loaf about , in and under their wagons .
