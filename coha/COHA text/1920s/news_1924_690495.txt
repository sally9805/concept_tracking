There has been considerable criticism because Mr. Shaver , who , alfRough he has not been formally elected National Chairman , has been functioning as such , did not come to Clarksburg from his home at Fairmont , twenty miles away , until late this afternoon . Many of the committeemen believe that Mr. Shaver has already lost an opportunity for Derionais conferences with the committeemen who have already arrived to obtain information regarding the situation in each State . and to take steps to start an Immediate campaign . The feeling among some of the committeemen , particularly those from the : West , is that valuable time has already been lost and that Senator La Follette has been permitted to get a start while the campaign for Mr. bavis has been ' lagging . 0 .. ttotiter point of difference among the committeemen already here concerns the **26;272;TOOLONG .

Spellacy , regional campaign director for the district that includes the New England States , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Delaware , took to Clarksburg as his guests the members of the National Committee from the States in his jurisdiction , and In addition several pro:ni1 neat Democrats made the trip on the same train , which got away , almost a minute late , from the Pennsylvania sta .

On their return home , she said yesterday , one old Maine backwoodsman took her husband to task and told Mr. Pattangall that the Maine people expected a man to be able to control his wife . The Governor replied , according to Mrs. Pattangall : " Ell , my friend , you evidently do n't know Mrs. Pattangall . If you did you would wonder how it came she allowed me to vote the way I did as long as I did .

Howes , committeeman from South Dakota , has prepared a resolution to eliminate both rules , but is being urged not to present it at the meeting of the committee tomorrow , but to wait until after election , on the theory that any controversy within the party organization should be avoided now . Most of the committeemen from the Southern States are reported to be opposed to the abrogation of the two rules . Walter Moore of Alabama , one of those so opposed , has taken the initiative in preventing a discussion of the matter at this time . It was said to be probable that Mr. Howes would be induced to defer his resolution until the meeting of the committee , which is expected to be held next January , following the election .

" I understand that there is a strong movement for La Follette among the farmers of the State , which will also draw largely from the Republican Party . Thp factional Republican troubles in .
