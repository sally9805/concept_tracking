POLITICAL NOTES <P> In the harbor of Manhattan , two bargees stirred sleepily last week . It was only about eleven o'clock in the morning and the bargees , who had gone to bed at ten the night before , were drowsing until it became time to eat their supper . One of them mumbled a curse and sat up angry and bewildered . Soon his companion did likewise ; the two stared at each other with alarm and annoyance , for the air was full of strange noises . Whistles , sirens , funnels , horns , bells , squealers , filled the morning with a troublesome cacophony . Suddenly one bargee shook his fist : " It 's that lazy bum Walker , " the bargee said , " now he 's back ! " " Yes , the loafer , " said the other bargee . Then both bargees moved into a shady place on the deck , for it was a hot September forenoon , and returned to somnolence . <P> What was to the bargees merely an unwarranted disturbance of early morning comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desecrated by a lack of transoceanic flights and prizefights . The man so scornfully described by the lazy fellows , was in reality James J. Walker , Mayor of New York , who had been abroad for two months . Surely the adjectives applied by the bargees were out of order ; they had read , no doubt , in spare moments , accounts of the Mayor 's whiskey-tippling in England , his beer-drinking in Germany , his liquid luncheons in Italy , his wine-bibbing in France and his miscellaneous guzzlings in bars and on trains elsewhere . But they had not read the Mayor 's most recent wireless message from on board the Ile de France : " It was to get a broader and more comprehensive view of city problems and their correction that I have traveled many miles through Europe and worked hard in my search for a rest . " <P> To reporters , Mayor Walker said , as he drew near to New York , " I studied housing , hospitals , water-supply and transit . . . . I never had time to ride on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always something else going on . . . . The funniest thing that happened to me abroad was the most pathetic . For two weeks I 've been refusing good drinks . " " How often ? " asked incredulous newsgatherers . " Continuously . " " Why ? " " Hell , " said the Mayor of New York , " you spoil it by asking why . I was sick ! " Later the Mayor of New York said : " The greatest thrill of my life was when I knelt at the feet of the temporal head of the church in Rome . "
