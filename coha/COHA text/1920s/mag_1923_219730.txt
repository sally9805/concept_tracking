" Medical experts should be permitted by law to examine the bodies of all persons who die of peculiar or unusual diseases . " This plea was made by Dr. Simon Flexner , director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , who is quoted as saying : " The United States should have a law similar to the one in Austria which gives this power to experts of that country who are studying how to combat disease . Our hands will remain tied until we are allowed the same liberty . " It was through the performing of innumerable autopsies that Pasteur came to discover his treatment for rabies . He went to morgues and studied-he always had an autopsy of patients of his who died , and by studying every condition he was able to present medical science with one of the greatest discoveries of all time . " I have been working for four years to have this law passed in this country , and I believe that within the next ten years medical science here will be enjoying the same freedom in performing autopsies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
