txt Conciliation between Church and State in Italy was declared by Premier Mussolini one of the chief things that would cause the Fascist regime to live in history when he delivered a speech today before a wildly enthusiastic and deeply appreciative audience of some 4,000 Fascist chiefs , composing the first Quinquennial Council of Fascism . The meeting was held in the Royal Opera House , and the Premier 's speech reviewed the achievements of his government . " Only with conciliation has the separation of Church and State become complete , " he said . " Each now has its rights and duties , and each can collaborate with the other as a sovereign independent State . The instincts of the people often come nearer the truth than the brainy lucubrations of intellectuals . The Italian people feel that the solution of the Roman question is reason for pride and evidence of the strength of the Fascist regime . " All Fascist leaders from the provinces convened in Rome to hear Duce 's words , were crowded into the Royal Opera House , which wore its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm . The body of the theatre was packed with standing Fascists , while tier upon tier of boxes were similarly filled . It was almost purely a male audience , only about half a dozen women being seen in the hall . Only the uniforms of the Fascist militia who occupied one whole tier of boxes contrasted with the dark clothes of the remainder of the audience . In the centre of . the brilliantly illuminated stage a gold and damask table and a gold and damask armchair were placed in readiness for Il Duce on a raised dais . Behind were chairs for members of the Fascist Grand Council . Behind these stood the 400 Fascist candidates for the approaching elections . They showed up clearly against a background of decorative laurel bushes with which the stage was liberally garnished . Audience a la-oung One . The audience , whose members on the whole were extremely young , cheated boredom during the wait for the Premier 's appearance by singing Fascist war songs in chorus till the vast hall reechoed with refrains with which Fascist youth had marched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome . The singing was punctuated with applause as the main Fascist chiefs made their appearance and took seats on the stage . Signor Farinacci , formerly secretary general of the Fascist party , and Senator Devecchi , former Governor of Italian Somaliland , were the first to take their places and they received a great ovation . General Debono , Under Secretary for the Colcnies Under Secretary for Corporations ; Signor Rosoni , head of the Fascist syndicates , and Mussolini 's brother , Rinaldo , also were loudly cheered . Signor Farinacci brought the house down when he suddenly jumped up and returned soon afterward arguing with Secretary General Turati of the Fascist party . Silence fell over the opera house when Signor Mussolini 's arrival was heralded . Every one appeared to be holding his breath to catch the first glimpse of him . When he appeared on the stage enthusiasm broke out . Handclapping , cheers and cries of " 11 Duce ! Il Duce ! " continued amid growing excitement . Signor Mussolini appeared in the very best of humor . He smiled at his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applause and seemed pleased and happy at the warmth of the reception . The cheering redoubled in intensity when he stepped on the elevated platform ana raised his arm toward the audience in the Fascist salute . Then suddenly , when the ovation was at its height , he put out his hand in an imperious gesture and complete silence fell over his listeners immediately . Speaks Only 3-5 Minutes . Signor Mussolini spoke in his usual forceful and incisive style , using few of the flowery phrases which are used by the majority of Italian orators . He spoke in quick sentences , seldom giving the audience time for applause . as if anxious to get the speech over as soon as - possible . Only thirty-five minutes after he had en- tered the theatre it was again ringing with the cheers marking his exit . Fe e ? " slightly ? tier half an hour , however , he held ? his audience spellbound , although his speech dealt almost entirely with the past and was eally nothing but a rapid review of the main Fascist legislative achievements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ii Duce said , would be fully dealt with in the crown speech at the inauguration of the new parliamentary Legislature . The Premier began by saying that the fact - that today marked a fortnight before the general election should not make the people think that it was an electoral meeting . That was a mere coincidence , he said , and the ' meeting was ' indeed nothing but a council of war of Fastismo'ggeneral staff .

Speaking of the army , the Premier said that its morale and discipline are the finest in the world , but that military expenses are being kept within the lowest possible limits . Italy , he said , does . not seek .. war but peace , especially with ' neighbors , and is working at the evolution ' of a new system of life " conciliating tradition with progress and machines with spirit . " For this work , he declared , peace is necessary , but Italy is ready to defend itself if attacked . Of the financial . situation , he said that Italy is. still in a state of convalescence just as are all the other European ? nations . " Mussolini , Stresses Conciliation . Of the .

This created a state of enmity between Clitirch and State which had been a thorn in Italy 's side for more than half a century . " But conciliation is at last achieved through the separation of Church and State , " he continued . - " Each now has its own duties and each can collaborate with the other as a free sovereign State in ' treaties , as every one must admit their fundamental justice . Conciliation is always preferable to enmity and - peace to war . . . . " The Cathblic religion has 1 , preeminent position in - Italy , but other religions must - be neither persecuted nor . hindered nor otherwise interfered with . " The Premier finally spoke on the personal life of the  --  head of the Italian . State . In six years , he said , he ' has given ' 60,000 audiences and answered almost 2,000,000 petitions .

The list of achievements on which they would then be able to look . back he said , would by then be considerably longer .

The Premier emphasized that peace between the Italian Government and the Vatican was an event of supreme importance not only for Italy but for the entire world . By the Lateran , Treaty , he said , the Holy See " at . last solemnly recognized the Italian kingdom under the House of Savoy with Rome as its capital . " Giving the other side of the pit- ; ture , the Premier said : " We , on our part , loyally recognized the sovereignty of the Vontiff and the Holy See which in reality existed de facto .

Reviews Achievements . The Premier then proceeded to review Fascist achievements in all fields of government . He referred to the improvement of the Merchant Marine , reforestation of the Italian mountains , the increase of agriculture , the development of public instruction , the perfection of communications and fuller explotation of the colonies . He dwelt especially on the pacification of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes and other labor troubles . Italian social legislation , he said , is now the best in the world . It is mmtrue , he declared , that Fascismo is State Socialism , because it recognizes and respects property , but ' at the same time does not show favoritism or weakness for any class of society whose excessive claims might endanger the life of the country . Fascismo at the same time is achieving the pacification of the spirit , ending lawlessness which existed before its advent , the Premier asserted , adding that justice is the fundamental postulate of Fascismo . In this connection he stated that all criticisms of the special military tribunal for the defense of the State which depicted it as a partisan organization working vengeance on the enemies of Fascismo were quite unjustified , as the tribunal acted with severity but with justice : As proof of this ' he declared that of 5,000 individuals ' tried by this tribunal more than 4,000 were acauitted , 275 were condemned to               @ @ @ @ @ @
