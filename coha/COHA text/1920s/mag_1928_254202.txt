No Southern Democratic paper ever flayed Tammany as thoroughly as the Republican Chicago Tribune last week flayed the head of the Republican campaign in Chicago . It said : <P> " Homer Galpin , chairman of the Republican county central committee , said that he would be in charge of the Republican campaign in Cook County and then went north for a vacation in Wisconsin . . . . <P> " His part in local politics and government , his associates in and out of office , his connections with the disorderly , disreputable and lawless auxiliaries of politics are known to every one who knows anything about local conditions . It might as well be Al Capone in charge of the campaign . <P> " Such a management assumes that the only durable influences in Chicago political action are the influences of the racketeers , bombers , machine gunners , kidnappers , beer needlers , panders , joint keepers , gamblers , pay roll mendicants and petty thieves , fee robbers , habitual criminals , immunized murderers , and such gang chiefs as are able to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of official patronage on strictly business terms . <P> " This the political hoodlum , highbinder , and hijacking combination which had things in hand until the votes were counted April 10 after a campaign of political assassination , house bombing , ballot box stuffing , intimidation , assault and every kind of gang terrorism . <P> " The scoundrels , blacklegs and professional pickpockets , treasury raiders , till tappers , exploiters of women , card sharpers , commission killers , per diem gun men , contract bombers and percentage kidnappers used all their violence to nominate a ticket which would be good for four years more of all this , dated from next November , and the combinations of politics , crime and vice were defeated in a desperate effort of the people of Chicago to get rid of them . <P> " The candidates who were the beneficiaries of this revolt of the voters against government which had ceased to be civilized and politics which was nothing more than rapine , grand larceny , degeneracy , sadism , privileged murder and systemized extortion , must be touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely a fleeting episode in the experience cf credulous or apathetic voters and that every one is willing to forget it and welcome all the blacklegs back at the table . <P> " There is no truce with these fellows . . . . "
