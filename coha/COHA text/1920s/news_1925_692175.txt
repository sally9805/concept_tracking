txt Mr. Johnson Not a Bound Brooker . In the exchange of pleasantries in the Committee of the Whole last Wednesday between Mayor Hylan and myself , the Mayor combated the Controller 's and my insistence that Important projects lie over for the Walker Administration by asserting that I lived-in Bound Brook . N. J. - I need not call attention to the irrelevancy of such a statement , but as a politician I would like to correct the Mayor 's error , particularly in view of the fact that in the late campaign we made much of the fact that Mr. Waterman actually lived many years prior to his candidacy in New Jersey . I shall thank TREI TIMES to let me say that the only foundation for the , Mayor 's assertion is that in former years I spent some weeks in the Summer on a farm I owned near Bound Brook , but I no longer possess it . JOSBPH JOHNSON . New York . Dec. 3 , 1925.                 @ @ @ @
