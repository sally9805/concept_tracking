txt It has been nearly two and a half years since the cannon roared the last barrage of the great war , and in that time statesmen have been unable to provide machinery for the reparation to which victory gave the conquerors the right . Three weeks remain before the first of May , the final date under the treaty , for notification by the Allies to Germany of the indemnity she must pay , and with that date so near the victors do not know how they will collect , nor do the vanquished know how they will pay . Put the blame where you will , the situation remains what it is . France . the chief beneficiary of Germany 's payments if they are made , and consequently the chief victim if they are not made , is making preparations for military action . There are no pronouncements to this effect , but it is true . No French Government can stand which does not act forcibly if Germany does not give evidence of willingness to make good . Paris has not definitely decided what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready by May 1 . An effort is being made to shape the military plans to avoid calling up extra classes . Germany , or at least the German Government , appears to be coming to a realization that France g/a.e , FAts ? , tp .. , , gict . And , therefore ; , sagi ' ' ' ' effort'Itintere France 's hand off her collar , Germany will probably make a new reparation offer between now and May 1 . Such is the . evident meaning of an interview given last night by Dr. Simons , the German Foreign Minister , to the correspondent of the Matin at Berne , where he has been resting . Incidentally , Dr. Simons said he had not sought American intervention , but had sought in sending his . memorandum to Washington only to make the German position clear . Dr. Simons was asked what Germany Would do between now and May 1 . " I can not give you any precise propositions we will make , " he said , " for two reasons . First , it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in the second place , having been away from Berlin for two Weeks . I must get in touch with my colleagues before formulating exact proposals which might lead to a new refusal by the Allies , which would cause grave danger . " I have not sought to obtain intervention by the United States . My purpose in sending my memorandum was simply to set forth the point of view of Germany in face of that of the Allies . In so far as I am concerned , you will remember that at Spa I said clearly that we desired to repair the devastated regions . I was acting in conformity with my official declaration . But the question is not simply restoration of tile devastated regions . France undoubtedly wants money , which makes the situation more difficult . Money is something we have not got . We have to get it , and that is a hard task . We can settle the reparations question only by direct agreement with France . " In this question of reparations France is the dominant power . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the Allies Will prevent her from putting into force extended penalties . If she wishes to crush us , she can do it . I never counted Oa division among the Allies . We have got to talk business with France , but 1 have no confidence in conferences like tlict of London . We must find a stew basis . We got a good start at Brussels , but , unfortunately , those businesslike conversations were cut off . " At London I expos : ! d our attitude according to my instructions . I had no authority to accept the variable factor Proposed at London . It has been said I refused the principle of a variable annuity . That is nut true . I believe that something like that can he worked out . 1 went slightly further than my instructions at London . because 1 am a man who has Perhaps a larger sentiment of our obligations than those whose interest is concerned in domestic politics . " The capacity of the country is not only a matter for technical consideration . but also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point of view 1 am more optimistic than r.1 any others , but the Allies must take into account this psychological factor . " I say now that 1 would not remain in a Government which did not declare its intentions to fulfill its obligations to the utmost capacity of Germany . " I believe that in a very few days we are going to show in an irrefutable manner our good faith . " The French nation . 1 am convinced . will prefer to put our good faith to the test rather than to crush by force of KITI15 , without profit to any one , an adversary already disarmed . " Continuation and extension of Penalties , of which 1 recognize the psychologic origin in the French spirit , will To meet the Entente 's economic penalties Germany has appointed an official " Anti-Reprisal Commission , " of which Hans Kraemer , one of the nation 's leading industrialists , is Chairman , and Hugo Stinnes is a member . Herr Kraemer was Chairman of the commission of experts which framed the counter-proposals to the Allies presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Foreign Minister . While most Germans declare themselves unable to analyze the methods by which the Entente hopes to . en/ore ? the economic demands , Herr Kraemer has figured out their effect upon German commerce and industry . " When the Entente begins the blockade of the Rhine , " he said today , " our export trade to former enemy countries will be completely ended . This will represent a decrease of 35 per cent . in Germany 's exports . Only such deliveries to the Entente nations and to America may be made as were actually begun prior to next Thursday . " Although I am at the head of the Anti-Reprisal Commission , this does not Mean that we shall attempt to dodge the Entente 's measures . While I believe some shippers will continue shipping without showing the origin of articles shipped through neutral nations and although an Italian statesman has informed me that he knows a hundred ways in which Germany could avoid the reprisals , Germany 's leading industrialists will not dodge the national obligations . " Our Finance Minister and other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not aid either our economic or industrial situations . " Eventually these reprisals will prove impossible economically . At the beginning there will he many industries forced to close down and there will be a vast unemployment problem . " Our committee already has presented a plan to the Government which we feel will do much toward relieving the unemployment situation and also be of great constructive value to the nation . " We propose to levy a 10 per cent , tax on all rentals . This would make available a vast sum which we would use in building houses , thereby at once giving employment and solving the housing problem . Germany today is short a million homes . We plan to build 150,000 annually . Also we are planning a great four-track railway system to replace the present two-track lines . " EXPENSES FRANCE MUST MEET Figured at 14,000,000,000 Francs Annually for Ten Years . PARIS , April ** in the devastated regions will bring the expenditures of France up to at least 14,000,000,000 francs annually for ten years . This is the calculation in the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recoverable from Germany which will be presented in the Chamber Tuesday by Deputy Charles de Lasteyrie , the official reporter . It is estimated that the reconstruction still to be completed and having a value of 26,000,000,000 francs before the war , will cost from 80,000.000.000 to 130,000 , - 000,000 . Taking the lowest figure in the annual budget at 8.000.000,000 , with 4 , - 000,000,000 in pensions and 2,000,000,000 interest on money already spent , it is declared impossible for France to find this vast sum of money , and the report says , " at any cost Germany must do it . " Criticism of the Reparation Commission 's secrecy regarding expenditures is voiced by M. Lasteyrie , who declares there are many apparently justified complaints of excessive personnel and unwarranted salaries in this commission , and that his repeated demands for the commission 's budget have not been answered . His report quotes the Foreign Office 's reply regarding the secret proceedings of the commission and says it is untenable that the Inter-Allied Commission could not be held accountable to the allied parliaments . By EDWIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for my country , but for all Europe . " Dispatches from Berlin to the Paris newspapers confirm the impression that Germany is about to make new offers .
