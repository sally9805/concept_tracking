Dutch trade is suffering from the French blockade of the Ruhr . At Rotterdam , Holland 's largest port , shipping has been brought practically to a standstill . Thousands are without work . <P> Before the Ruhr occupation most of Germany 's trade from that great industrial area passed down the Rhine and through Rotterdam . The new situation is viewed by Dutch shipping companies with much concern . The Netherlands Government has , however , received official assurance from both France and Belgium that the interests of Holland will be safeguarded . <P> This protest from the Dutch comes on the heels of a similar representation from the Swiss Government .
