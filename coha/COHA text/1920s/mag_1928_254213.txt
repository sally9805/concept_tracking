The growth of cities was a slow change , once . Generations lived and died and the wolves looked down from the hills at night , at the closed gates of the city and its lighted houses or dark streets . Armies rode out and returned , victorious or defeated ; plagues descended , disappeared ; a king died or a traveler came from far away ; gods were discovered and forgotten and the people in the city lived in the same houses , the wolves still stood on the hills at night , looking at the same city , the same walls . Cities are built more quickly now , without walls , in places with no hills . <P> In Chicago , last week , a picnic was held for the people who have lived longest in the city . These gathered in a park and held contests among themselves to decide which one was the " Oldest Settler , " the greatest ancient . <P> L. S. Oliver and Mrs. Catharine Barry were the oldest continuous residents of Chicago . These two had lived there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 94 , said that she had six children , 26 grandchildren , ten greatgrandchildren and one great-great-grandchild . Then she began to dance a waltz which resulted in her receiving great applause and a prize which pleased her . <P> Otto Wellman claimed without successful contradiction that he had lived longest in the same house-for 66 years at No. 300 DeKoven Place . <P> The most popular person at the picnic was Richard Evans , 91 . A nimble fellow in button-shoes , he shook hands with everyone . It was found that he was the oldest foreign born inhabitant of Cook County ; he had been brought there by his parents when he was ten months old . He had a trombone with him which he played at frequent intervals . He seemed eager to tell everyone about the old days when he was a young man and when Chicago was a young city . Said Richard Evans : " I knew Chicago before it had a railroad , a paved street , a trolley car , or a telephone . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
