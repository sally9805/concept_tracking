Sturdy , moral , beef-consuming Britons know who Miss Sylvia Pankhurst is-know her as a famed " militant suffragette " who smashed windows , was often arrested , and repeatedly hunger-struck until British women won the vote in 1918 . <P> Last week the smug beef-consumers decided that they now know what Sylvia Pankhurst is . They made up their minds quickly when she displayed to reporters , last week , a chubby , black-eyed man child , and announced that he is her natural son , aged four months . <P> Interviewed , Miss &; Mother Sylvia Pankhurst said : <P> " I have not gone through a legal ceremony . ... I do not consider that marriage ought to be the subject of legal contract . It is far too intimate and personal a matter for that . . . . My union with my husband is entirely free . ... I believe that the tendency of the future is in this direction , and that posterity will see nothing remarkable in our decision . " <P> " But . " ' queried a newsgatherer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Smiling enigmatically blue-eyed Sylvia Pankhurst would admit only that the father of her black-eyed babe is " a foreigner ... a man much interested in politics . " <P> Of her babe she said , " I hope he will be a great man . ... I have no brothers living and there is no one but he to perpetuate the name . . . . You see we have called him Richard Keir Pethick Pankhurst . " <P> Sylvia Pankhurst 's sister Christabel , also a onetime " militant , " has recently announced that she is " now active in the movement for heralding the personal and visible Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ , as foreshown by the present signs of the times . " <P> The mother of these sprightly spinsters is Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst , lawful widow of the late Richard Marsden Pankhurst , LL.D . She too has dabbled in suffrage and brick throwing but now confines herself to peaceably furthering national reforms .                    @
