txt Gerald Chapman scored his first point in his fight for life before Judge Newell Jennings and a jury in the Superior Court here today . Mies Edith Larsen , 22 years old , failed to identify the bandit as the man she had . seen tampering with the lock on a. front door in Davidson &; Leventhal 's department store n New Britain just before it dosed Saturday night . Oct. 11 . Chapman is accused of having killed Policeman James J. Skelly inside the establishment soon after 7 o'clock on the following morning . Mies Larsen , in a fur coat and blue cloth hat , was obviously ill at ease under Chapman 's steady gaze . Her eyelids fluttered and drooped and she flushed as her voice sank to an almost ina.udibie Whisper . Even when Judge Jennings told her that the - jury was unable to hear , she had difficulty in making herself understood . State 's Attorney Hugh M. Alcorn directed her testimony to the point where the suspense was tense . Each moment those in the crowded courtroom expected him to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the i%Tew Britain store at the time of the murder , It she could paint out the man she had watched as he stood close to the door with folded arms . Chapman 's Iron nerves were plainly stretched toward the danger point . He moistened his lips and , with his left hand , rolled a handkerchief into a ball , which he clutched tightly . State Disathises ? the Witness , But Mr. Alcorn elected not to ask the question and , with a suddenness which took the defense by Surprise , he announced ? that the State had finished with the witness . As Miss Larsen left the stand an ill-suppressed murmur of exciternept filled the courtroom , and Sheriff Edward W. Dewey pounded his desk for order . " The State did n't dare to ask her to identify Chapman because Mr. Alcorn knows be was n't there , " said former Magistrate Frederick J. Groehl , chief counsel for the defense . " At the time of the habeas corpus hearing , they had Miss Larsen in the courtroom for two hours watching him and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larsen 's story , following the completion pf the jury , by the testimony of Nornian D. Hurd . a lock expert employed by the - American Hardware Company at Bristol , ' Conn . He exhibited a model of the lock on the two front doors to the Davidson S. Leventhal store and explained that , by taking out a , set screw , it would be Possible for the door to be locked on Ithe outside and opened from the inside by any one , even though the key was , lacking . The obvious purpose of Miss Larsen 's evidence was to show that the robbery had been carefully planned and that some one had tampered with the door so t . at it might be used as a hasty means of exit in ease of need . She ' ' said that the counter behind which she was stationed was from fifteen to twenty feet from the door and that late In the afternoon she had seen the stranger etanding close beside it . It would easily have been possible for a man with folded arms , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have held a screw driver and to ' have tampered with the lock in the manner described by Mr. Hurd . She told of having watched him for fifteen minutes . At one time , she said , he left the store . returning later , and remaining close to I the door until 5:15 o'clock . Twelfth Juror Found Unexpectedly . The introduction of testimony began unexpectedly this afternoon after fruit ' less hours of quest for a twelfth juror. twenty-six talesmen , summoned last night , were present when court opened this morning . All had been rejected or excused by 11:30 and a recess was taken until 2 o'clock , while subpoenas were served on another panel  --  the fourth since the trial began Tuesday morning . Only twenty-four men out of the thirty for whom summonses were issued could be found , and at 3 o'clock the possibilities of obtaining a twelfth juror from among them had been exhausted . " Hartford does n't seem to be very productive , " observed Judge Jennings . " We 'll have to try it once more , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country again . Mr Sheriff , kindly go out on the street and get five talesmen as soon as convenient , and notify me when you have them . " It took the deputies half an hour to round up the requisite number . The second of the surprised citizens who had been brought in  --  Samuel A. Chamberlain , a clothier  --  was accepted . He said he had formed no opinion on Chapman 's guilt or innocence and that he believed he could serve fairly and with an open mind . " Would you convict of first degree murder on circumstantial evidence alone ? " Mr. Groehl asked him . " Well , I 'd have to be shown , " Mr. Chamberlain replied " Nothing can sway me if I think I 'm right . I would n't be prejudiced either way . " " That 's the kind of a man I want , " said Mr. Groehl , but as the defense had already exhausted its allotment of twenty-five peremptory challenges and Judge Jennings had announced that he did not believe he had a legal right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice in the matter . Members of the Chapman Jury . The jury is made up of Fred W. Vests , East Granby , farmer ; Thomas H. Rourke . Unionville , insurance agent ; A. IV . Burrows , Bloomfield , bookkeeper and accountant ; Lawrence Klein , Enfield , salesman ; Walter S. Case , Canton , salesman : Emerson E. Olcott , Glastonbury , retired tobacco grower ; Charles H. Isleib , Marlborough . farmer ; George 0 . Hubbard , Bloomfield , insurance agent ; Gavan S. Fallow , Wethersfield , retired mach-Mist ; William J. Crockett . Manchester . plant engineer : former State Senator Arthur E. Bowers , Manchester , retired , and Samuel S. Chamberlin , Hartford . merchant . After the Court had denied a motion to excuse John R. Lambert . a Glastonbury farmer , who was the fifth talesman called today . because he admitted that Chapman 's failure to take the witness stand would count against him , the State challenged for the sixth time since the work of drawing a jury began . A minute or two later Chapman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect , decreed the rejection of Frederick M. Snow of Windsor , a farmer . " I would rather see Chapman take the stand . but I would n't hold it against him if he did n't , " Mr. Snow said in answer to a question by Mr. Groehl . " You wo n't go into the jury box with the idea that he is a supercriminal or anything like that , will you ? " Mr. Groehl asked . Mr. Snow said Ile would not , but Chapman shook his head , as Ile did after the questioning of Leslie C. Seymour , a Windsor Locks fanner , had ended . Mr. Seymour said he had been out of the State for three months and had merely read the headlines in the newspapers at the time of Skelly 's slaying . " Would two weeks of it inconvenience you ? " - he was asked . " What . two weeks locked up in a jury room ? " Mr. Seymour exclaimed , evidently startled at the prospect . " No. two weeks for the whole trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  --  not if I bad something to eat , " Mr. Seymour returned . Chapman Laughs at Retort . Chapman laughed audibly , but , nevertheless , refused to accept the talesman after he had admitted a moment later that he had had business relations with State 's Attorney Alcorn twenty years ago While Willard Drake of Windsor Locks , a real estate dealer , was being questioned a messenger boy , oblivious of what was going on , wormed his way through the courtroom , approached the witness stand and unconcernedly started to deliver a telegram . He appeared surprised that the Deputy Sheriffs should interpose and . order him out . He obeyed sheepishly as a laugh went up , in which Chapman joined . " I do n't know . whether the telegram was designed to influence this witness or not . " Mr. Groehl said . Drake owned to an opinion that the mere fact of Chapman 's ? indictment would imply that he was guilty . He was challenged by the State after he had said that he would want direct evidence if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Windsor , a farmer . did not think that he would convict on circumstantial evidence alone , although Mr. Groehl failed to get him to say that . even if directed by the Court . he would give the defendant the benefit of the doubt if a certain set of circumstances pointed toward both guilt and innocence . Judge Jennings overruled a motion . to declare Mr. Griswold disqualified , whereupon , at Chapman 's behest , the defense used its last challenge . The State challenged Harry E. Stoughton and Henry W. Chandler , both South Windsor farmers . Mr. Stoughton said that lie would demand more than She usual amount of evidence before he would send a man to his death , while Mr. Chandler appeared to have no disbualifying opinions . While Chapman was eating his luncheon of egg and cheese sandwiches , doughnuts and a glass of milk , he told his guards that lie was sorry Chandler had not been accepted . " I wonder why the State challenged him . " he said . ' There was nothing in the man Griswold for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court because they declared their disbelief in capital punishment or because they announced that they possessed an opinion in the case which could not easily be changed by the evidence . Egiward ifilligaia of Hartford. - . President of the Phenix " Insurance Company , said he would do his best to be fair to both sides , but that he had pressing business engagements in cons nection with his railroad interest . He was excused . Stands While Indictment Is Read . It was 3 : 40 o'clock before the jury box was filled and Chapman went through what was plainly the ordeal of hearing the indictment read to the men who are to decide his fate . He stood at the table beside his counsel , his hands folded upon a long envelope , his eyes downcast . But he listened intently as Lucian H. Fuller . the clerk , read the long list of aliases under which the State claims he had gone , " Waldo W. Miller . George Lawrence , George Chartres . G. V. Colwell , C. , W. Eldridge and Edward Bryce . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and premeditately " shot Policeman Skelly with " a lead bullet propelled by gunpowder . " inflicting a mortal wound from which the policeman died two hours later . Before the reading was finished , a court officer directed Chapman to take his seat and he sank back , his eyes fixed on the jurymen until Mr. Fuller had finished . Then , without any formal opening of the case other than the reading of the indictment , Mr. Alcorn called Max J. Unkelbach , a surveyor and civil engineer of New Britain , as the first State witness . Blueprints of the interior of the Davidson &; Leventhal store and of the centre of New Britain in that immediate neighborhood were tacked to a blackboard and at Mr. Alcorn 's direction Mr. Unkelbach explained them . Mr. Groehl declined to cross-examine him . Samuel M. Davidson , a member of the department store firm , told of a door leading into the rear of . the store from an alleyway which skirted the northerly aide of the building . At the time of the murder , he said , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden one which slid open . It was secured by nothing more than a lock and hasp . The witness pointed out the stairway hich led from the rear of the store to what he described as a balcony office on the mezzanine floor . There was a landing where the stairs turned half way up , he said , and on this landing was a cabinet safe which contained $2,089 in cash when the store was locked on the night before the murder . A smaller , old-fashioned safe which opened with a key , stood in the 6 ! rice . The latter contained about $175 in bills and change in a. small envelopes , He identified the money and its wrapper , - which Mr. . Alcorn offered in evidence . Describes Condition of Safes . " I first knew of the break at the store Sunday morning , " Mr. Davidson - said . " I received a telephone message and at once telephoned the Police Department . I went to the store and found a crack on the south side of the larger safe on the landing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detectives told me was ' juice . ' " " I object . " interposed Mr. Groehl . Judge Jennings sustainelpim , and Mr. Davidson continued : . " The door of the safe was bent outward and the combination had been broken off . In the office , papers were strewn all over the floor . The door of the small safe had apparently been blown , the small compartment containing the 3175 opened , and the money was gone . ' Mr. Davidson identified photographs of the two safes , which , he said . had been taken on the morning after the murder . They were handed to the jurymen for their inspection . He also identified a tumbler , which , he said , had been taken from a lock on one of the two front doors . The witness said there were windows on the north . side of the store at the counters , and that the two in the rear nearest the door opening from the alley had colored glass . " Not very much light came in from them , did there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Davidson answered . " They were particularly de , - signed to throw light in the rear of the store . The front was darker . " Court recessed until morning when the State finished with Miss Larsen , and the jury was taken to a hotel under guard after Judge Jennings shad cautioned its members . that they were to receive no information from any source concerning the case outside of the courtroom . Mr. Groehl said tonight that he intended to produce an unidentified Springfield business man who would testify that Walter E. Shean , the chief witness for the State , borrowed $40,000 from hire in either 1921. 3922 or 1923 . According to Mr. Groehl , the witness would swear that Shean sent him several checks : - totaling $10,000 , in part payment , and that receipts were given him . The witness , according to Mr. Groehl , mailed the checks to Lyman Besse. head of the Besse system of stores An New England , for the purpose of buying some stock in the company . In some way , Mr. Groehl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed and a friend of Shean 's went to the Bond Hotel , posed as Mr. Besse , and received the checks , which later were destroyed . Says the Slayer Was Not Seen . Mr. Groehl said he had received two letters from New Britain , one of which was anonymous and the other signed with a name which he did not make public . The writers of the letters , Mr. Groehl said , volunteered to testify that Policeman Alfred E. Atwater , said-to be the State 's only eye-witness to the shooting of Skelly. admitted to them that he had never caught sight of the slayer 's face . A part of the signed letter , as given out by Mr. Groehl , said : " The writer said to Atwater : ' What kind of a looking fellow was that man ? ' Atwater replied : ' I could n't recognize him , for the store was in shadows , and I knew instinctively this fellow was no local one and I ducked . ' And then he repeated to me : ' You know , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , when I heard Atwater had recognized Chapman in Hartford , this rang through my mind ever since . He never recognized him " The writer said that Policeman Atwater was trying to shield himself from criticism for his action in dodging behind a counter ' when the safe-blower came down the stairs from the mezzanine floor ok Davidson &; Leventhal 's store With 11 ? 10veled revolver . ?
