Humanity pays tribute to many humble beginnings : Shakespeare first saw the light in a cottage at Stratford ; Lincoln entered the world by way of a leaky cabin in Kentucky ; while into the narrow limits of a cheap , one-story abode of Florida , Missouri , on a bleak autumn day , November 30 , 1835 , there came a feeble infant who , as " Mark Twain , " would live to cheer and comfort a tired world . It is true , they named him Samuel Langhorne Clemens , but it was only as Mark Twain that the world would learn to know and love him , and it is only as Mark Twain that , now , fourteen years since he arrived at what he himself termed " the dignity of death , " he is still universally loved and remembered . Mark Twain ? what dynamic syllables they are ! He chose them from his river experience ; a leadman 's call , signifying two fathoms ( twelve feet ) . The name had a richness about it . He said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear on a dark night ; it meant safe water . " It became somehow retroactive . We are inclined to think of him as Mark Twain even when , as an undersized boy , with a mass of light , sandy hair on a head too large for his body , he made almost any excuse to get out of going to school , this being the time when he and those graceless , lovable associates , Will Briggs and Tom Blankenship ( that is to say , " Joe Harper " and " Huck Finn " ) , engaged in certain adventures , to be told later in a book which other boys , of whatever age , would read and continue to read through  | the generations . He was a bandit in those days , a bandit and a pirate by turns ; then he became a printers ' " devil , " which was no great improvement ; and later a pilot , miner , journalist , and lecturer ; but by that time he had become really Mark Twain , and as such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities , sought by the world 's best and foremost , loved by all men in all lands , and mourned by them when he died . The father of Mark Twain , John Clemens , born in Virginia , had grown up in Kentucky , where he married Jane Lampton , the belle of her region . They left Kentucky for Tennessee , but their fortunes declined , and they finally moved to Florida , Missouri . John Clemens was a lawyer , a man of education ; but a dreamer , full of schemes that usually failed . " Little Sam , " as Mark Twain was at first called , inherited much from him , but more from his mother , who bestowed upon him her sense of humor , her prompt , quaint philosophy , and that pleasant drawling speech which gave her wit , and his , a serene and perfect setting . John Clemens died , a failure , before little Sam was twelve years old . The boy 's school days now over , he became a printers ' apprentice . Life 's turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy met one on a windy afternoon when he overtook a flying scrap of paper which proved to be a leaf from some old history of Joan of Arc . What he read there aroused in him an interest and an indignation that , while he lived , would never perish . The boy now read other things , and his career as one of the world 's mentally  | elect was assured . From the first he was as eager to read as to write . After two years as apprentice , Sam went to work for his elder brother , Orion , who had acquired the Hannibal ( Missouri ) journal . Once during his brother 's absence he tried his hand at editing the paper , and set the town a-laughing by his satires of a rival editor . - Also , at this period he had two anecdotes printed by the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post . This he considered a great triumph , but he did not follow it up ? not immediately . Prospects being poor in Orion 's print shop , Sam struck out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later he was " subbing " on the Philadelphia Inquirer ; then , becoming homesick , he returned to the West . This was late in the summer of 1854 . On his way home he waited an hour or two in a small hotel at Muscatine , Iowa . A book on the hotel writing table contained pictures of the English sovereigns , with brief facts of their reigns . This information , which he there committed to memory , became his groundwork for all English history . Orion Clemens wanted his brother to remain with him , but Sam preferred a job on the St. Louis Evening.News . Later , he joined Orion in the job-printing office which the latter had opened in Keokuk , Iowa . There he read a book which fired him with desire to seek his fortune collecting cacao in South America . He was , however , without funds . But , as in the case of the  | Joan of Arc episode , the wind again became the messenger of Providence when , one bitter day , it hurled into his vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fifty-dollar bill . No one claimed his find when advertised , so this good fortune remained with him . Sam Clemens made Cincinnati his first stop . There he worked at his trade until spring , by which time the young cacao hunter , having saved money enough for the next stage of his journey , engaged down-river passage one day on the steamer " Paul Jones . " Once aboard , an early pilot ambition returned ; the romance of river life stirred strongly within him . He laid siege to the pilot , Horace Bixby , a small , brisk man , who , before they were half-way to New Orleans , accepted the young man 's offer to go with him as cub pilot , upon the payment of one hundred dollars down , the balance to be paid as he earned it . Thus began the river voyaging which was to continue through four sunlit years ; which was to give Mark Twain his pen name , and to the world an immortal book , " Life on the Mississippi . " At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full license as a Mississippi River pilot . He had , as it seemed to him , become one of the elect . He was entirely happy . He loved the river as he would never quite love anything again . Yet , according to Bixby , " Sam was always scribbling when not at the wheel . " He was now twenty-five , and regarded piloting as his life profession . The Civil War , which broke out in the spring of 1861 , brought the river chapter to a sudden end . For two weeks he played at soldiering , then went up to Keokuk to visit his brother Orion , who had just been appointed Secretary of Nevada Territory . Sam had the money that Orion needed to carry him to Carson City , and he was made Orion 's pri- vate secretary . Their happy journey across the plains is told in " Roughing It . " In Carson City , finding neither duties nor salary attached to his position , he devoted himself to the study and enjoyment of the easy-going freedom of frontier life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him a priceless education . He engaged in mining , but the snow-covered ledges and the frozen hillsides of Nevada yielded him no treasure . One or two of his letters home , of this period , printed in a Keokuk paper , through Orion , found their way into the Territorial Enterprise of Virginia City . The early literary impulse stirred again , and presently some sketches , signed " Josh , " also appeared in the Enterprise . They brought him no return in money , but all unknowingly their author was knocking at the door of the Hall of Fame . The " Josh " letters attracted the attention of Joseph T. Goodman , owner and editor of the paper . Being in need of another reporter , he offered the all-but-discouraged miner twenty-five dollars a week to join the staff . Thus , at last , the master of the world 's widest estate came to claim his kingdom . This was in July , 1862 . The new member fitted well into the Enterprise group , adding a fresh vigor of thought and expression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen name " Mark Twain , " signing it for the first time to an Enterprise letter appearing February 2 , 1863 . It quickly became known and popular all up and down the Pacific slope . In May , 1864 , Mark Twain accepted a position as reporter on the San Francisco Call . Presently dissatisfied , he began the more congenial work of sending a daily San Francisco letter to the Enterprise . His frank criticism of police officials stirred up trouble , and one day in December , 1864 , he arrived at the mining cabin of Jim Gillis on Jackass Hill .  | At Angel 's Camp , in Calaveras County , he became a miner . He did not make his fortune at this pursuit ? he only laid its corner stone , for it was at Angel 's Camp that he heard the story about a trained frog that failed to win a wager because the owner of a rival frog had secretly loaded down the trained jumper with shot . A few months later , to please his fellow humorist , Artemus Ward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frog story for Ward 's forthcoming book of travels . The manuscript , arriving too late , was handed over to the editor of the Saturday Press , where it appeared November 18 , 1865 . Copied and quoted far and wide , the name of Mark Twain became known to newspaper readers everywhere . In March of the following year he went to the Sandwich Islands to do a series of letters for the Sacramento Union . It proved to be an eventful sojourn . Returning to San Francisco , he offered himself as an entertainer on the lecture platform , choosing as his subject the Hawaiian Islands . The lecture was a genuine triumph . Having money now , he returned to visit his mother , after an absence of five and a half years . He also made a trip to Hannibal , where he lectured , receiving a welcome that would have satisfied Tom Sawyer himself . In St. Louis he heard of the projected " Quaker City " Holy  | Land excursion and resolved to join that novel ocean picnic . He wrote to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was accepted . When he went to the shipping office to see about his passage , he learned from a reporter that he was not only booked but starred as an attraction . It was his first taste of fame on the Atlantic seaboard . Meanwhile his book " The jumping Frog and Other Sketches " had appeared , and he had delivered his Sandwich Island lecture at Cooper Union , New York , to a packed house . In " The Innocents Abroad , " Mark Twain has told us the story of the " Quaker City " excursion to lands beyond the sunrise . Returning to America , Mark Twain found himself , if not famous , at least in very wide repute . His letters , sent to the Alta and the New York Trib:me , had carried his celebrity into every corner of America , and beyond she sea.1/ He concluded an agreement with the American Publishing Corn pally of Hartford to use these letters as the basis of a book which the company would sell by subscription . The result was " The Innocents Abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langdon and his daughter Olivia , father and sister of one of his companion voyagers on the " Quaker City . " Olivia Langdon made a deep impression on the young author . In her Elmira home , which he presently visited , their acquaintance ripened . The proofs of his book were coming , and they read them together . She became his literary adviser ? a position she would hold her life long , for on February 2 , 1870 , Olivia Langdon became Mrs. Samuel Clemens . On the morning of the wedding , Mark Twain received from his publishers a royalty check of four thousand dollars . Later in the day the young couple were presented by Mr. Langdon with a beautiful house , situated on Delaware Avenue , Buffalo , in which city Mark Twain had become editor and part owner of a newspaper , the Express . Matters did not go well in Buffalo ; one misfortune suc- ceeded another . Clemens disposed of his Buffalo interests and went for the summer to Quarry Farm , Elmira . There conditions improved . The work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and he was in the clouds . In the autumn the Clemenses selected Hartford as their permanent residence . A child , Susy , was born in March , 1872 . During that autumn and the following year Mark Twain made his first visits to England . His stay each time was a continuous ovation . His hotel swarmed with celebrities . His second visit was a lecture engagement , and , during almost an entire winter , throngs filled the largest hall in London to hear him ? a record in the history of lecturing . It was between these visits that , in collaboration with Charles Dudley Warner , he wrote the " Gilded Age . " At Quarry Farm , during the summer of 1874 , he began " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , " and did his first story for The Atlantic Monthly , whose editor , W. D. Howells , was to become his lifelong friend and literary adviser . The Clemenses now had a beautiful home in Hartford , but spent most of their summers at Quarry Farm , the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twain 's study there was an inspiring place , and there it was , in 1876 , that he made a beginning on a new Tom Sawyer story , " The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . " Few of his stories were finished straightway . " Tom Sawyer " was completed in 1875 , " Huck " in 1883 . To obtain material for another book of travel , Mark Twain , with his wife and two children , sailed for Europe in April , 1878 . His boon companion , the Rev. Joseph Twichell , followed . Meeting at Baden-Baden , these two congenial spirits set out on a tramping trip through Germany and Switzerland . The family followed by rail , and met them here and there , when they rested from their wanderings . The Swiss holiday ended , Twichell returned home , while the Clemens party remained another year in Europe . Arriving home in August , 1880 , Mark Twain plunged into the completion of " The Tramp Abroad . " This book completed , he took up again one of his un- finished stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before . This tale , one of his favorites , was finally dedicated " To those good-mannered and agreeable children , Susy and Clara Clemens . " That year ( 1880 ) a third little girl was born , whom they named Jane Lampton for her grandmother but always called her Jean . Mark Twain was now forty-five years old , his work highly successful , his income large , his fame world-wide . But he was not satisfied to " go softly . " Instead , he restlessly invested large sums in enterprises that dazzled , and that had one striking family resemblance : none of them paid . Moreover , he now took steps toward becoming a publisher on his own account . Combining with James R. Osgood of Boston on " Life on the Mississippi , " he installed Charles L. Webster , his nephew by marriage , as subscription manager in New York City . " Life on the Mississippi " was published in 1883 . In 1884 , finding his finances somewhat reduced , he persuaded George W. Cable to join him in giving public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . In the course of their wanderings they read at Keokuk , Iowa , where Mark Twain 's mother , now in her eighty-first year , came to hear them . Upon his return from the reading circuit he embarked in a book ventures the success of which made Mark Twain 's firm , Charles L. Webster &; Corn- pany , one of the foremost in America : the publication of General Grant 's Memmoirs . For a pleasing picture of the Clemens household and the truest of Mark Twain at this period ( fifty years old ) , let us quote from a " biography " of him by Susy Clemens , then a highly romantic child of thirteen . " . . . We are a very happy family ; we consist of Papa , Mama , Jean , Clara , and me . It is Papa I am writing about , and I shall have no trouble in knowing what to say about him , as he is a very striking character . Papa 's appearance has been described many times , but very incorrectly ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any too long , just right ; a Roman nose , which greatly improves the beauty of his features ; kind blue eyes , and a small mustache ; he has a wonderfully shaped head and profile ; he has a very good figure ; in short , he is an extraordinarily fine-looking man . All his features are perfect , except that he has n't extraordinary teeth . His complexion is very fair , and he does n't ware sic a beard . " He is a very good man , and a very funny one ; he has got a temper , but we all of us have in this family . He is the loveliest man I ever saw , or ever hope to see , and , oh , so absent-minded . " Mark Tvvain 's publishing venture did not maintain its great headway . He was no business man . The great success of the Grant book made it easy enough to get other books , but many of them did not pay . Then there was the Paige typesetting machine , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a month . Notwithstanding these distractions , he managed to complete " A  | Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court , " published by his own firm in 1889 . What with the typesetting machine and a business with growing liabilities , lark Twain was finding it increasingly difficult to provide for the costly Hartford home . Living abroad would be much cheaper , so he decided upon European residence , and sailed with his family June 6 , 1891 . During their European wanderings the Clemens family met many distinguished men and women . In Berlin , the Emperor invited Mark Twain to dinner . This invitation awed little jean Clemens , who said : " Why , Papa , if it keeps on like this , pretty soon there wo n't be anybody for you to get acquainted with but God . " At Nauheim , the following summer , Mark Twain worked on " Tom Sawyer Abroad " and " Those Extraordinary Twins , " the latter being the original form of " Pudd'nhead Wilson . " That winter at Florence , in the Villa Viviani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan of Arc , " for which , consciously or unconsciously , he had been preparing for nearly fifty years . There came interruptions . At home a panic era was beginning . He stopped work on " Joan " and sailed for America to see if he could raise money to help Webster &; Co. weather the storm . Accomplishing nothing in a business way , he was back in Florence by the end of May , often spending part of his night walking the floor in anguish of his uncertainties . Finally , in  | the hope of saving at least his book royalties from the wreck , he sailed for the second time that year ( 1893 ) for New York . In this darkest hour Mark Twain met Henry H. Rogers , to whose stronger financial shoulders his crushing burdens were now shifted . Mr. Rogers promised also to look into the typesetter business . He told Mark Twain to " stop walking the floor . " But even Mr. Rogers could not prevent the inevitable , and , the following April , advised the firm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the creditors . Mr. Rogers represented Mark Twain in the transaction , and prevailed upon the creditors to let the author retain his copyrights . Settlement was to be made on the basis of fifty cents on the dollar , but both Clemens and his wife declared that sooner or later they would pay in full . Back with Mrs. Clemens in France , settled in a little cottage at Etretat , he renewed work on the story of " Joan , " which he finished that winter , in Paris . Arrangement for both serial and book publication was made with Harper &; Brothers , and it began anonymously in the magazine . His authorship , however , was suspected almost from the beginning . Spring found Mark Twain again in America , preparing for one of the greatest platform ventures ever undertaken ? nothing less than a lecture tour around the world -- to restore his fallen fortunes . With Mrs. Clemens and his daughter Clara they set out on the long journey , July 14 , 1895.  | The lectures began at Cleveland . Arriving at Vancouver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be forwarded to Mr. Rogers , the first instalment on a fund to wipe out the unpaid debts . In September they arrived in Australia , where his success was such that he was able to swell the debt fund at the rate of about a thousand dollars a week . From Australia the lecture party journeyed to New Zealand , Ceylon , India , and South Africa . Their tour was one prolonged ovation , a royal progress . They sailed from South Africa on the fourteenth of July , 1896 , a year to the day since they had left Elmira , arriving at Southampton , England , on the thirty-first . Fourteen months earlier they had sailed from Southampton to America . Their circuit of the globe was complete . Nearing the end of his fight against debt , with happiness once more apparently just ahead , Mark Twain now met one of life 's tragedies . A cable announced the death of Susy , left behind in America . Mrs. Clemens brought Clara and Jean back to London , where Mark Twain that winter wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels . Another winter and they were in Vienna , where their apartments at the Hotel Metropole ( later at the Kranz ) became known as the " Second Embassy . " The aristocracy of the Austrian capital took delight in doing honor to hark Twain . It was during the first winter in Vienna that Mark Twain discharged his  | great burden of debt . " Following the Equator , " published in November , had been well received . With the accumulation of royalty and the profits from his long lecture tour , he was able to make the final payments to his creditors . Headlines shouted it everywhere ; long editorials told the story . The failure of the typesetter , the collapse of the publishing firm , the trip around the world , the tragedy of Susy 's death ? these things were all reviewed , and his final triumph glorified . Mark Twain , no longer worried about finances , now gave himself up to literary work , lecturing , and social diversions . The articles he wrote in Vienna are included in his collected works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest existing essays on Hebrew character . " The Mysterious Stranger , " also of Vienna , contains much of his best and most earnest writing . The Clemens family left Vienna in May , 1899 . Following a summer in Sweden , they went to London , living at first in apartments and later at beautiful Dollis Hill , an old house just outside of London , at one time occupied by Gladstone . And now America once more called him . In October ( 1900 ) , bidding good-by to foreign travel forever , as Mark Twain hoped , they sailed for New York . His arrival was a national event . America tried to outdo Europe in paying him honor . Every newspaper was filled with the story of his great fight against debt , and his triumph . He was offered a dollar a word for his writing ? he could name his own terms for lectures . Sensational offers like these did not tempt him . He confined his literary work to a few magazines , and presently concluded an arrangement with Harper &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be twenty ( later thirty ) cents per word . The same firm also undertook the publication of all his books , by this time collected in a uniform edition . The Clemens family did not go back to Hartford . They could not bear the sorrow of Susy 's absence in the familiar rooms . Instead , they took a house at 14 West Tenth Street , and , when summer came , went to a log cabin on Saranac Lake . ; Here Mark Twain wrote " A Double-Barreled Detective Story , " a burlesque on Sherlock Holmes . That winter ( 1901 ? 1902 ) they lived in the Appleton Mansion , at Riverdale-on-the-Hudson . In June of the following year Mark Twain went West to receive the degree of LL.D . from the University of Missouri . This return to his native state was in the nature of a last general visit to old associations and friends , to the haunts of his Tom Sawyer days , and to the old home on Hill Street , where he was photographed standing at the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each station , to cheer and wave as the train pulled in , and to offer him flowers . This was even more than Tom Sawyer dreamed . Also the great river itself joined in according him honors ? the harbor boat that had been named the St. Louis being now rechristened the Mark Twain . After triumph , sorrow ? always , with Mark Twain . In August , 1902 , Mrs. Clemens was taken violently ill at York Harbor , Maine . In October they brought her to Riverdale in an invalid car . A winter of deepest anxiety followed . She was sufficiently improved to make the trip to Elmira in June , and during three peaceful months spent her days reclining on the wide veranda , while Mark Twain , in his study , completed " A Dog 's Tale , " the last writing he would ever do there . Mrs. Clemens had sweet memories of Florence , and in October the family once more left America and took up residence in the Villa Quarto , just outside that city . For a time the invalid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a day on which she had appeared especially bright and cheerful , just as her husband was coming to say good night , she that was , as he said , the " life of his life " passed to the peace of death . They brought her to America , and , from the house where she had been made a bride , bore her to her grave beside Susy . The rest of that sad summer was spent in a cottage at Tyringham , Massachusetts . In the autumn Clemens and his daughters Clara and Jean set up a new home at 21 Fifth Avenue , where was brought the Hartford furniture which they had not seen for thirteen years . During that summer he began " Eve 's Diary , " which , in spite of its humorous aspects , conveys his love and adoration for the one he had laid away . Adam 's single comment at the end , " Wheresoever she was , there was Eden , " was his own comment , and perhaps the most tenderly beautiful line he ever wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article began his association with Mark Twain . As a boy of eight I had listened with the others , around the evening lamp , to the story , read aloud by my mother , of the " Innocents " on their long pilgrimage . From that time forward no one had meant to me quite what Mark Twain had meant . Thirty-six years later ? it was the evening of Wednesday , January 3 , 1906 , at a dinner given him in the Players Club ? I found myself just across the table from the man who had been my literary idol since childhood . Two years before , while I was preparing the " Life of Thomas Nast , " we had exchanged some letters , but there was very little in the way of acquaintance between us . Now he was here before me . That night will always remain to me different from other nights . At  | intervals throughout the dinner Charles Harvey Genung , sitting beside me , insisted that I should write a life of Mark Twain . I was not impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant bidding good-by to our guest , there came an impulse which prompted me to ask if I might some day call to see him . To which something likewise prompted him to answer , " Yes , come soon . " The following Saturday I was at 21 Fifth Avenue , where I found Mark Twain propped up in bed , as was his morning custom , against great snowy pillows . He offered me a cigar , and we talked of many things , including the Thomas Nast biography . Then I found myself saying that his approval of that book had led me to hope that I might one day undertake a book with himself as the subject . I expected this to end the matter , but , after what seemed a long and ominous silence , he said that , although he had at various times been preparing autobiographical chapters , no arrangement had been made for a detailed story of this life . Then turning those piercing , agateblue eyes directly upon me , he said : " When would you like to begin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in a dream , " Whenever you like . I can begin now . " " Very good , " he replied . " The sooner , then , the better . Let 's begin while we are in the humor . " We arranged for daily dictations , and thus it was that I became the biographer of the creator of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn ? the most fortunate biographer in the world , I thought ? and the years have not changed my mind . Through Mark Twain 's great love for billiards , our relations , at first chiefly of a literary nature , in time became personal as well . For Christmas he received from Mr. and Mrs. Rogers a handsome combination billiard and pool  | table . Presently the morning dictations became of secondary interest , and , like a boy , he was looking forward to our afternoon of play , which never seemed to arrive quickly enough to suit him . Any number of his friends were willing to come in for his entertainment , but it finally turned out that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of hours each day to being beaten at billiards ? and enjoy the operation . To me the intimacy of association and the personal incident growing out of it were invaluable . That winter I took up residence in his home , so that I might be handier , as he said , for billiards . After that , during most of the days and far into the night , we were together . On the eighth of June , 1907 , exactly forty years from the day he had sailed on the " Quaker City " to win his greater fame , he sailed for England to receive from Oxford University the literary doctor 's degree . All of the attentions that had distinguished his former London visits could not equal what now happened to him who , as a boy , had been Torn Sawyer and played with Huckleberry Finn . Home again after an absence of six weeks , he summoned me to " come down and play billiards . " With the echoes of his great triumph still ringing in my ears , I was prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found him , however , already in the billiard-room , knocking the balls about . As I stepped in the door he said : " Get your cue . I 've been inventing a new game . " That was all . The pageant was over ; the curtain was rung down ; business was resumed at the old stand . In June , 1908 , Mark Twain took possession of his new home at Redding , which he named " Stormfield , " such a villa as he had known in Florence , but adapted to American needs and climate . He was at home there from the moment he had seen the glowing billiard-room . We spent the first evening at boisterous , triumphant games that continued until midnight . In June of the next year , 1909 , Mark Twain developed " breast pains , " as he called them , which , as the months passed , came with increasing frequency and severity . His trouble was a heart affection , angina , and at times he suffered terribly , but he never complained . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on playing in his turn . Later in the year we sailed for Bermuda for a month 's holiday . Five days following our return -- -it was the morning of Christmas Eve ? his daughter Jean , the head of the house since Clara 's marriage to Ossip Gabrilowitsch the previous October , died of heart failure . He bore the shock with that calm with which he met every great disaster . His last finished work , begun immediately , was " The Death of Jean , " a tender and lofty tribute , published a year later in h arper 's Magazine . In January he returned to Bermuda , where for a time he seemed to improve . By April , however , his condition had become so serious that his doctor advised taking him home to Stormfield , and I arrived there with him on the evening of Thursday , April 14 , 1910 . Just a week from that day and hour Mark Twain died . He had been asleep , and as the sun touched the horizon the noble head turned a little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breath that had been unceasing through seventy-four tumultuous years had stopped forever . The worn-out body had reached its journey 's end , but his spirit had never grown old , and to-day , still young , it continues to cheer and comfort a tired world .  |
