AS usual at this time of the year we have night-cliLh trouble . We g ? 1 so seldom , and entertainers jump around so fast from one place to another , that we are always a veritable mine of misinformation , and sometimes just downright silly . We memorize a few salient facts , such as that Emil Coleman is at 10 East Sixtieth Street , only to go there and find out it is Rudy Vallee . We are never any closer than three jumps behind Texas Guinan , about whom , from year to year , we remember only the pithy and unhelpful fact that she lives in West Eighth Street with her mother . This confusion in the matter of night-club entertainers has cost us a lot of weight , but the solution has finally come to us . We have adopted Ramon and Rosita as a generic name for all night-club entertainers and refuse to think of any act as anything else , even if there are three men in it named Clayton , Jackson , and Durante . AYEAR or so ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , was urging the owners of hot-dog stands to do something about the disgraceful appearance of the countryside . Now that we look around at the results , we 're not sure that everybody ? Th should n't have just kept quiet . Prosperous and willing , the roadside people leapt into the spirit of the thing . Down came the old bill-plastered frame but with the Moxie sign , and up a thatched-roof replica of an English tavern . Up , also , went Chinese pagoda rotisseries , Spirit of St. Louis waffle dens , goody shops in the shape of peanuts , restaurants in the shape of cornucopias , and restaurants in the shape of the letter " Q. " The spirit of Alice Foote MacDougall spread like the fiery cross through the rural districts . In the old unregenerate days , the roadside places used to be pretty had , heaven knows , but they at least had a kind of indigenous appearance , like Indian shell mounds . Now what we have is a permanent World 's Fair on every highway . Well , we asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LEOPOLD SToxowsKr intends to have no more monkey business at Carnegie . People who arrive a second late for the first note of his Philadelphia Orchestra will have to wait outside one hour , until the intermission , before they can be seared . This is pretty stern . We think concertgoers should he seated between numbers . Conductors are apt to he just a shade too touchy anyway . The long embarrassing pause which they make before the first movement , to allow ladies to unravel their programs , usually makes us so uneasy that we are unable to hear the first few phrases of music at all , Maybe the reason we 're so tolerant about concert audiences is that any little disturbance during a number reminds - us of that terrific scene in " Dulcy " in which Lynn Fontanne removed the tissue paper from a box of candy during a piano solo . The memory of that so amuses us that we are quite content to sit in our seat anti chuckle .

They could he made a force for good  --  could return , in fact , to their old rule of Man 's Inspiration . To illustrate : it is well known that plain girls embark for their offices a shade before 8:29 A.M. , and that five minutes or so later ) oung ladies of more charm begin to put in an appearance . The grade then rises rapidly and steadily so that by nine o'clock the girls in street cars and on corners are almost all beautiful . After nine they are lovely indeed , even though sometimes petulant and possessed of a certain hauteur . The point is , no really good-looking girl can be got out of bed before 8:29 , which means that the great mass of male workers miss the morning inspiration of seeing lovely faces and well-tailored hips .

At present they 22 OCTOBER 2 , ( 9 19 Z 9 arc acting in a very high-handed manner . They are putting , at their tables by the windows , young waitresses of great purity of soul but no especial looks , while the tables far in the rear , unseen by the multitudes in the streets , are served by the contest winners . That kind of selfish aggrandizement would have to give way to our larger dream , if we were to accomplish anything in the way of Civic Glory through Feminine Grace . Success IN one of the recent plays , which opened and closed quietly out of tuwn , the principal character was a considerable villain . For every million he made there was a broken heart . Each act showed him making millions and breaking hearts . He made a million in bootlegging and broke his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theatre the members of one party made derogatory remarks about the rascal .

If you like riots and accidents and take a sardonic pleasure in watching women revert to type , go down to Fourteenth Street on a Bargain Day . Blue and white flags ; ire hung out , as for a holiday , in front of the store which is having the sale  --  although this bit of information may be misleading , for usually the stores on both sides hang out flags too , thus catching tile overflow and saving the cost of a half-page newspaper ad . On the morning of the sale , six or eight police , assigned to this special duty , arrive early , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flowing down from the " L. " By a quarter of nine , grim , chattering , they have been formed into line , four abreast , and begin to surge against the grilled gates which the storekeepers long ago found necessary to avoid being stormed before everything is ready . Wooden frameworks are put up the night before toprotect the windows hut , as intimated above , they frequently do n't work . At the R. Smith sale , near Sixth Avenue last week , they did n't work . We were there when they broke , and a window with them . The gates were opened at a signal from within , the police bawled for order . Unheeding them , the ladies began to push . Animal squeals went up all along the line . They rose to a shriek , and the big drive was on . A railing around a window gave way , the glass broke , and a great piece fell like the blade of . a guillotine . Two children were injured . The police bawled threats , but momentum was fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no breasting it . It was many minutes before the victims could be removed . When the first thousand or so women got inside , there to shout insults and grab things , the outer gates , two in number , were finally forced shut by main , blue-coated strength . A two-hundred-pound officer guarded one ; the other , which was before the broken window , was locked for the day . This left a bottleneck  --  and with the bargain hunters still scurrying in from Jersey and Queens . The officer was instructed to let a few women in at a time , but as soon as he got the door slightly ajar they ganged him and he went down like a set-upon football tackle . Three or four policemen came to his rescue , but by the time they got him on his feet and restored the line of blue , two or three hundred women and a few men had got in the store . Some men accompany their wives , as a sort of interference , get the women inside , and depart  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the Gettysburg of the war against cops for dollar-ninetyeight dresses . Here , when they have a sale , the sidewalk is roped off to keep the ladies from raging out into traffic and knocking down innocent trucks . Klein 's once worked out a scheme to keep order within their store . They arranged rope aisles in serpentine fashion , putting in several corners that the shoppers had to turn , and thus avoided a long straightaway down which the attacking column could storm thousands strong . The system did n't work though . The ladies just tore the ropes down . Service BELATEDLY we learn of the perplexities of a florist over Miss Ishhel MacDonald 's attendance at the football game a week or so ago . Mr. Whalen and his confreres arranged to send her to it in fine style , providing a motorcycle escort , guards along the way , a flourish for her arrival in her box , etc . Just at the moment the machinery was to be set in motion , somebody realized that no corsage bouquet had been ordered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone , called a florist and commanded flowers , specifying the hour and the minute they were to be delivered and to whom . The florist was so flustered that he completely forgot to ask what kind of flowers were wanted , and obviously a bouquet worn to a football game must have something to do with the teams playing . He remembered , of course , the minute he hung up the receiver , and he tried to call back but was told that messages were temporarily not being received . This left him pretty much up in the air . After thinking about the matter deeply , he looked in the papers and found that Columbia was playing Wesleyan , and N.Y.U. , Fordham . He then took some violets , for N.Y.U. , tied theirs with a light-blue ribbon , for Columbia , and wrapped the stems in maroon tinfoil , for Fordham . He delivered the corsage and never heard any more about it . Hamelin .1k . PIED piper would be handy right now in the railroad yards along Riverside Drive . Everything was going along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by filling in , when a plague of rats descended . On a clear night , they say you can count a hundred to two hundred running along the rails , laughing and talking . This is really not so disgraceful as it might seem ; as a lot of people know , one of the loveliest parks on the French Riviera has rats . The railroad people , however , are sensitive , and they have been quietly holding rat hunts for weeks . They also have been furtively setting traps , dozens of them , along the parapets above the river , particularly at Seventy-ninth Street , which is a kind of rat headquarters . The situation there was slowly being got in hand when the engineers discovered that a kindly old lady was coming down from her home each evening after dusk , feeding the rats fish , and then turning them loose . This , you may believe , vexed the huntsmen . " It got to be like Penelope 's tapestry , " said one of them . " We wove and the old lady unwove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She still feeds the rats fish , but does not liberate them . The Unknown Major WIEN feeling like it , La Guardia tells about about itthis h Mr. ppe Ln- ing at his political headquarters . He slipped ( if our enterprising candidate can be said ever to slip ) from his private office to the room of one of his managers . The latter was out ; only his secretary there . " Who shall I say called on urn ? " she asked . This astonished Mr. La Guardia , who undertook properly to impress the young lady . " Mis-ter La Guard-din ! " he said with deep emphasis , and turned to leave . " Howd'ya spell ut ? " she called after him . Pour le Sport NOTHING in autumn 's color scheme approaches the Maurice Chevalier shirts for men  --  those incredible blue ones with the bright red ties to go with them . We saw one flash by in Broadway the other morning . We also discovered a whole window full of them . The sign said " Chevalier shirts " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sha-vahl-yey . " That was n't all , either . With infinite solicitude , lest a customer wear the shirt at the wrong moment , the shop had provided a little window-card bearing the pert admonition : " For bridge or radio . " Night Court " nISORDERLY conduct , " said the patrolman . The magistrate of the Night Court stared down at the weak little man who had been brought in . " What for : " " Pictures  --  selling dirty pictures , " said the patrolman . He then produced the evidence . The evidence consisted of , we blush to report , several dozen post-card pictures of Venus de Milo in the Louvre . The magistrate examined a couple of them . " Two dollars , " he said . The man paid the fine . Folly of 1908 THAT square tile structure , windowless and hare , rising like a tremendous chimney ten stories above the roof of the seven-story building directly south of the Times Building is ( in case you have always wanted to know ) the Times Square Tower . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out , because it is n't in evidence anywhere . It was built , together with the building beneath it , about twenty-one years ago by a man who came from St. Louis and got the idea the first day he was here . His plan was to use it solely for advertising signs , and since in those days a tower seventeen stories high could he seen from 24 OCTOBER 2 , 19 2 9 New jersey , it did n't seem a bad ; den . He bought Considine 's old Metropole Hotel , the haunt of the sporting gentry , demolished it , and put up the present structure . Unfortunately he had no more than done this when tall buildings began popping up all around . The skyscraper era had begun . Pretty soon the tower could n't be seen well from anywhere but across the street , and by that time pedestrians in Times Square had become so numerous and so frantic that it was all anyone 's life was worth to look up . Along with skyscraper trouble came legal difficulties . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , notably an early and generally remembered one showing a kitten play with a spool of silk , It stopped crowds for a while , but the Knickerbocker Hotel went to court and got out papers . Eventually the gentleman went hack to St. Louis . You can go into the building now . The first seven stories , laid out for offices , are ornate  --  marble stairways , heraldic carvings on the walls , and so on . An elevator runs to the seventh floor , whence springs the tower . You can look up into it . It is just a shell , floorless and hollow , but with a lot of steel supports to hold it together . Mood TT was a particularly crisp and blowy 1 . October day . Dusk hrid gone through the street . We rang our friend 's hell and were admitted to his apartment . He seemed to he it work , writing . From the bathroom came the sound of the shower . After a long interval we interrupted . " What arc you writing about , and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ntly . " Writing about April , " he replied , glancing sadly out the window at the clear cold sky . Father Bill TIE story of American horse-racing must include a picture of Father Bill Daly  --  a word picture it will have to be , because he dislikes the camera , being one of the old school that pays little attention to clothes and general appearance . People who see the old fellow around the paddock mostly take him for a nondescript hanger-on , but those who know him respect him as the best trainer of jockeys horse-racing has ever known . If you ask him how old he is , he will say , " Oh , a hundred . " A good guess is that he is in his middle eighties . He schooled the famous Snapper Garrison , now a bit gray himself , and Jimmy McLaughlin , called the greatest of American jockeys . Most of his protCaes have long since become inactive , but their names are mighty in the lore of the horses ! Danny Maher , Winnie O'Connor , Guy and Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy Fitzpatrick , Willie Brennan , Willie Palmer , and many , many others . More than half a century ago , Daly 111101 4r JO ? * - 1041 used to ride in a sulky behind trotters . Then he lost his leg in a railroad ac-cident . Hampered in his driving , he took up horse and jockey training . Up to a few years ago he had a stable of his own . He used to keep his horses at his home , a fine one at Sheepshead Bay , and on the day of a race in which he was entered he would drive his horse , hitched to a side-bar buggy , over to Belmont or Aqueduct . He never owned a famous horse , not even a very good one , but now and again one of his would beat the best . Notably , his Sailor Boy ' , running at odds of a hun-dred to one , won from Broomstick . It was long ago that Daly found it profitable to teach youngsters to ride . He would obtain indenture papers on boys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert and had attracted attention , and then sell their contracts to the highest bidder , often for thousands of dollars . Educating the youngsters cost him little , for while they were in training they would groom and exercise his horses , do odd jobs , and sleep in the hayloft . Father Bill was a hard master , but most of those he graduated wore dia- t. monds afterward . He does n't train jockeys any more and does n't think much of the present-day jockeys ? points out that they ride in automobiles and that there are many foreigners among them , meaning too many that are not Irish . Now Father Bill is reputed to be worth half a million , but his wealth has changed him little . The biggest difference is , perhaps , that he buys his wooden legs now , instead of whittling them himself , as he used to do . The most famous story about him concerns this artificial limb . An S.P.C.A. agent , informed that Father Bill was ill-treating his horses , went to investigate and came upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very hot water . The agent tested the water , withdrew a scalded finger , and said that he would have to arrest Daly . Daly scoffed at the fellow 's tender fingers and offered to put his own leg in the water and keep it there five minutes . He offered , further , to bet twenty-five dollars he could do it . The agent tested the water again , and het . Daly put in his wooden leg and won in a walk . Samaritan MHE last guests to leave the Wal- dorf were the pigeons , who num bered possibly five hundred , and these have mostly been taken care of at No. 12 West Thirty-second Street . Mr. William Eckman , a photographer , set up a large penthouse on the roof there . The birds that have n't taken up residence in it have moved on uptown to the Library . High Noon of a Financier VOLT may remember that our rep-. " resentative at the Reparations Conference in Paris was to let all tech-Meal matters go and merely keep us informed as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ col-leagues did about the little things . Thus we were able to report that one day , in a quiet restaurant , Mr. Mor-gan complained about the prices , with the result that the proprietor argued volubly with the financiers M two lan-guages and finally brought out his books to prove ( in French ) that he lost money on everything but the asparagus . We call the incident up again because we have just learned what Mr. Young does about lunch here at home . It 's an important matter . More often than not Mr. Young lunches alone , at the downtown Savarin , 120 Broad-way . He detests con-versation during these meals , and has taken effective steps to pre-vent it . An old wait-er of long service , named Sam , always attends him . Long ago Sam was trained to take Mr. Young 's order and utter no word , no syllable . The financier looks over the menu , states his wants , and Sam does n't acknowledge the order , even by a nod . An uninitiated waiter might make some remark about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An uninitiated waiter might even tell Mr. Young he must be loony , reminding him that he had already eaten his lunch ; for , it turns out , the financier shatters all big-business tradition by sometimes eating two midday meals , a couple of hours apart . Mr. Young shows his appreciation for Sam 's silence by always tipping him fifty cents . He departed from this custom only once . After his first meal following his return from the Reparations Conference , he left a five-dollar bill for Sam . Even that day , after the long absence , nothing was said at the table . Mr. Youn , smiled , Sam smiled back , and that was all . Protection SEVERAL representative citizens were quietly drinking in one of the better speakeasies when the cops entered .
