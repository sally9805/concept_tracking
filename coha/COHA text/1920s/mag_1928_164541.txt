Last week , the Pullman Porter , most famed servant in the U. S. , started to go on strike . Then , at the last moment , he changed his mind , " for obvious reasons . " But he said he would strike some other day , soon , if his grievances were not adjusted . He had been getting in a position to strike for at least three years . <P> " Too many Uncle Toms " was the rallying cry of the Negro who organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters . He , Asa Philip Randolph , a high-headed Florida man , mental product of Jacksonville 's Cookman Institute and of City College of New York , editor of The Messenger , a Socialist in politics , undertook the promotion of the Pullman Porter as a matter of racial pride . He told the Pullman Company 's employes that they were guilty of slave psychology in continuing to make berths , shine shoes , lug luggage and be called " George , " for the wages the Pullman Company paid . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , and more than the difference . <P> Of the Pullman Company 's 11,000 maids and porters in the U. S. , some 7,000 harkened to Organizer Randolph and left a union which had been organized for them by the Pullman Co. , to join the <P> Brotherhood , which was encouraged though not adopted by the American Federation of Labor . They said that the Pullman work-wage scale which they protested was : $72.50 , plus $58 in tips , minus $33 expenses ( shoeblacking , meals , uniforms ) , for a 400-hr. month . The scale the Brotherhood proposed was $150 for a 240-hour month . The porters also objected to " doubling out " assignments , where porters who have just finished a trip are ordered out on another trip before they have had time to refresh themselves with sleep , baths , visits home . <P> Answering the porters ' protest , the Pullman Co. stated that $72.50 was the wage paid newly employed men . Oldtimers ' wages are as high as $104 a month . In the company 's judgment , tips run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high figure for " on the road " expenses . It pointed out that one-third of the porters receive two free uniforms per annum . <P> The company also said : " No porter works 400 hours per month . Some work only 100 hours and the average is less than 300 hours . Porters have sleep periods while on long runs and long rest periods at the end of runs . For instance : three-day run to Pacific Coast ( nightly sleep en route ) , then 24 or 28 hours off on the Coast . Three days back to Chicago and then a rest period of five and six days , with pay . <P> " Porters receive life insurance without cost to them , pensions on retirement . . . loans without interest , legal assistance , welfare work , etc. "
