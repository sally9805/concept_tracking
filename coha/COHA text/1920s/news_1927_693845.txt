txt The New York-to-Paris flight was still blocked by bad weather over the At.antic yesterd. y . Last night the pilots said the weather was worse than the day before , and showed little sign of clearing up before tomorrow . That was the bel. -f of James H. Kimball of the Weather Lan eau also , and he said that a flight for the next day or two would be inadvisable . All three of the contending planes were in the air yesterday . Commander Richard E. Byrd , who said he had several days of tests ahead of him before he would be ready to leave , flew his bic , plane for the first time and test ' ' his instruments . He said he was greatly pleased with the ship , but that he would not know just what it would do until he had made load and consumption and speed tests . The Bellanca was flown once by Clarence D. Chamberlin with Charles A. Levine , owner of the plane , as passenger , and Captain Charles A. Lindbergh took his plane up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all ready now to take off at any moment , and Lindbergh may fly his plane to Roosevelt Field today so it will be near the runway . Crowds at Field All Day . A huge crowd was around the planes all day long . Spaces in front of the hangars were roped off , and about forty Nassau County policemen under Captain Frank McCahill and Sergeant Wilson kept the crowds back . There was little confusion , and the spectators learned very quickly that it was not safe to go too close to a whirling propeller while a plane is warming up . There were at least 4,000 cars and 7.500 persons on the two fields during the day . Captain Ren ? Fonck , who piloted the Sikorsky when it crashed last year in the first attempt to get off for Paris , and Lieutenant Alvord J. Williams , winner of many speed races , visited the field yesterday . Lindbergh was the centre of attention all day . The Bellanca has been so long in preparation that visitors have got used to reading about it and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose rapid flight here from the Coast attracted so much attention , is brand-new and has made friends of every one by his good nature and modesty . He was besieged ' by all sorts of people until he took refuge in his hangar with a rope across the front to keep them out . He made an exception of some small boys , who gazed at him with open-eyed admiration and envy . The feeling of the crowd toward Lindbergh Was evident when he went out to climb into his plane during the afternoon on his second flight of the day . As he appeared in the open space alongside the ship , the onlookers began to clap and kept it up until Lindbergh ducked into his box of a cockpit and out of sight . After he had warmed up his motor , the plane was turned about and he quickly started off . The plane lifted easily after a short run and Lindbergh shoved its nose up sharply for a climb that showed its speed and manoeuvrability . He made a short flight in a wide circle while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane was wheeled back into the hangar . Lindbergh Escapes a Crash . In the first test during the morning Lindbergh was forced to turn his plane quickly on the ground to avoid hitting some photographers , showing that he can see even through his periscope . But the sudden swerve broke his tail skid and he had to have a new one installed . A slight crack was also found in the cap over the centre of the propeller , and it was taken off and repaired . This cap is merely for streamlining purposes , so the crack was of no importance . The plane is graceful in the air , and is streamlined as well as any of the planes in the race . It is a stock Ryan monoplane with a Wright motor , except that five feet have been added on each side of the wing to lift the extra load of gasoline . Few changes were necessary in the wing structure to take care of the strain of this extra length . The plane is very clean forward , with almost nothing to Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided yet whether to take an emergency radio set . If he does so it Will be very light , and not one With a generator . It Would send for only a few Miles . He said yesterday he WoUld no ' take off until the Weather maps showed he had a clear road to Paris , and that nothing any one else might do would swerve him from that decision . Lindbergh finished work on his plane at dark last night . He looked somewhat worn and tired . " I 'm knocking oft until 10 o'clock in the morning , " he said. - V'Tra going to spend the night With *lends in Pert Washington instead of ' at . the Garden City Hotel , to make pertain I 'm pot disturbed . " He denied he intended to make a secret take-off to beat the Belanca flyers . " The earliest start I can melte , the way it looks tonight , will be after midnight tomorrow , certainly not before , " he said . Commander Byrd 's big Fokker had three tests yesterday after it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On all three tests it was flown by Bert Acosta , who will probably be picked as pilot to take the place of Floyd Bennett , Commander Byrd 's pilot on the North Pole flight , who was injured badly on the first test flight of the plane . On the first flight the radio was tested by Malcolm Hanson , naval radio expert , who reached the large radio station at Tuckertown , N. J. , without difficulty . He also talked with two New York stations and with the Bellanca. plane in its hangar . The radio has a radius of from 250 to 500 miles . Commander Byrd went up himself on the second flight , his first since his wrist was broken at the time Bennett was injured . He tested his instruments , his speed and drift indicators and earth inductor compass , and found that his plane would make 120 miles an hour , Gas consumption tests were run on the third flight and it was estimated that the plane used thirty gallons of gas an hour . He intends to carry about 1,100 gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour would give him a little extra gas on a forty-hour flight , which would be just about the time required to cover 3,500 miles . With a following wind he would do it in less and toward the end his speed would pick up considerably . Chamberlin flew the Bellanca for quite awhile in the afternoon , going far down Long Island . He got into radio communication with several stations and with Jesse Livermore 's yacht in Long Island Sound . The engine developed a slight oil leak in one cylinder , but it was quickly repaired after the return . All the gasoline for the Bellanca has arrived and is in the hangar . It will not be taken to Roose-velt Field until just before the hop-1 off . Commander Byrd has a large open shed there also , under which his gasoline is stored , and Captain Lindbergh made arrangements last night to have gasoline sent to Roosevelt Field . Commander Byrd 's hangar is a beautiful place , compared to the Other hangars in which the transatlantic planes are stored . It is painted white inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung on the walls . There is an office for Commander Byrd and Mr. Whalen . Mr. Whalen is having a number of telephones and some cots installed for the benefit of those who may have to stay at the field all night as the start approaches . There was even a man with a hose wetting down the dirt in front of the hangar yesterday so that dust would not blow about , and the front of the hangar is protected by a large canvas Curtain .
