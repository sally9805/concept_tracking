THE uncritical and undocumented American layman who reads his-tory for his amusement finds himself lingering most sympathetically , perhaps , over volumes that deal with the Roman Empire of the first centuries after Christ . The substance is surprisingly familiar . Rampant materialism ; the ease and frequency of travel to all parts of the known earth ; the passion for speed ; the juxtaposition of great wealth and great poverty ; the breaking down of old social barriers and rise of a rich parvenu class ; the immense importance of money ; curiosity ; tolerance ; fear of the mob ; disillusionment ; syncretism ; the strong influence of rhetors and sophists and demagogues ; emancipation of women ; Greece playing the part , among the upper classes , that Europe has played with us in matters of culture and taste ; a tremendous influx of foreigners , so that not only Rome but other Italian cities ( especially ports ) must have been melting-pots like New York ? among these facts and conditions the twentieth-century American finds himself astonishingly and woefully at home . The Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished . There were the same powerless aristocratic laments ; the farmers complained and the profiteers flourished ; the rich bought for themselves new sensations which the poor clamored to have popularized ? and disillusioned men and women of fashion sought spiritual comfort from Oriental peddlers , being weary of the faith of their fathers . Just so . Someone ( Mr. Elmer Davis , I believe ) has said recently that Kipling 's Romans in Britain ( see Puck of Pock 's Hill ) are not Romans at all , but nice Anglo-Indians . Mr. Davis 's knowledge of history is profound , and mine is merely nil ; yet I wonder if the point is not that the better representatives of Imperial Rome in Britain were ? precisely ? nice AngloIndians . That Kipling meant it so we can not doubt . Similar conditions and responsibilities bring forth similar types . The argument from historical analogy is as dangerous as most other arguments . But it would seem that , in the wide fields of asphodel , the hard-boiled Anaerican and the hard-boiled Roman might meet and converse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pointed out , before this , that the cultural trend of the day is towards a fondness for life in the raw . As proofs , there can be adduced : the vogue of prize fighting , even among intellectuals and gentlefolk ; the vogue of plays about gangsters , prostitutes , pugilists , etc. , and of profanity and " frankness " on the stage ; the fluent biographies of bandits , crooks , outlaws , and hard characters generally ; the wide demand for " robust " literature , whether it be poetic , fictional , dramatic , historical , or critical . In short , all the " facts " that the public delights in " facing . " How about it ? What makes us hard-boiled , and are we going to keep it up ? What is the root of it all , the significance ? The root of it all , one supposes , is original sin , since that is the root of most human behavior . But one needs to define and delimit and specify a little more closely than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second and third ? In the book which of all others manages best to be priggish in the grand style ? the Eneyeloprdia Britannica ? I find a clear and colorless and delightful statement about the Emperor Commodus : " In spite of a careful education he soon showed a fondness for low society and amusement . " I have been told that recently a certain clergyman " had to adjourn a church meeting to give the men a chance to hear a fight over the radio . " No doubt , like Commodus , they were carefully educated . The vogue of prize fighting is perhaps even more significant than the " robust stuff " of the plays , the novels , and the criticism ; for every period is to some extent a period of revolt against the preceding one , and the nineteenth century , despite its intellectual and aesthetic power , had certain affectations and sentimentalitiesand false decorums that its descendants were sure to object to . Possibly , indeed , the latter half of the twentieth century will find us back among some resuscitated conventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lacking signs of " tenuities and caducities " in our literature that seem to be declining towards an age of pure sham . Mere intellectual revolt , fostered so artfully among the young by certain pseudo-seers , is not the whole story , of course , though it plays its part . No recent period has been more professionally disillusioned , more consciously cynical , than that of the eighteen-nineties , in spite of the naivete of the famous " Souls " as described by Lord Ronald-shay . Yet we are far from their point of view . For example , we seem at present to be deliberately unaesthetic . If " Art is Art because it is not Nature , " this demand for life in the raw can hardly be attributed to estheticism . IL is the substance of our art that is sophisticated , rather than the manner ; and our sophistication is chiefly a matter of specialized information . We sit at the feet of the hobo , the bruiser , the criminal , and learn , not because of their superior intelligence , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Our passion , I repeat , is for facts , not for method ; for nature , perhaps , rather than for art . This , one need not note , is the sign of a jaded palate . The fact is , one supposes , that luxury like Rome 's and ours always brings people back to the eternal crudities . The simple homespun creature wants chiefly a greater delicacy of life , softnesses that are outside his experience . When you go in purple , your curiosities all satisfied , your comforts all guaranteed , the ends of the earth ministering to your pleasure , where are you going to get a " kick " except from the primitive ? People who are obliged to live at the mercy of nature get no thrill out of sleeping under the stars . It is only the pampered person whose imagination is stirred by THIS HARD ? BOILED ERA 2G7 discomfort , peril , and pain . The man who encounters them daily longs only for a refuge . It can not be contested , I imagine , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much material comfort been at the disposal of the average man as now ; that never before has so much wizardry been performed in the interest of the simple citizen . Who has not open plumbing , a telephone , a motor car , a radio ? What householder does not get his heat and light from great distances , and much of his food and raiment from the antipodes ? When has the average man been so luxuriously served ? Most of us , as far as material comfort goes , are in a patrician position . Now luxury " in widest commonalty spread " can do one of two things , as we know . It can release us from the care of the body to the care of the spirit , and leisure can be applied to the civilizing of the individual . It can do something quite different : it can tempt the individual to seek ever farther and more furiously for the kind of thrill he is already familiar with and has a taste for . In a materialistic and insensitive civilization like ours , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to opium rather than to scholastic philosophy . Softened to a great extent by luxury , waxed fat like Jeshurun , the average citizen does not care to cleanse and strengthen his own body by the practice of some difficult sport ; he likes to watch other people doing it for him . Hence the enormous attendance at all sorts of professional games ? for much of the amateur athletic activity is in spirit professional . We are too sophisticated to be amused by anything short of expertise ; and we like the expertise to be startling , new , and , if possible , dangerous , since we have pretty well exhausted the safer and more conventional thrills . We have also exhausted the cheaper , more accessible , less exacting forms of beauty ; and , pretty generally , we are exploiting ugliness to see what we can get out of that . " The art of boxing is dead , " a very hard-boiled gentleman said to me , some years ago , in Nevada ; " what the public wants is knockouts . " The same dictum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermons , political speeches , cartoons , and jokes . It takes extreme violence to make us sit up . No play , no book , no sporting spectacle is going to thrill us unless it can compete with the front page of the newspaper . Since gangsters have taken to mowing down their enemies in the city streets with machine guns , we can no longer get a " kick " out of the isolated and furtive pistol . No art furnished for our entertainment can hope to " go over big " unless it is more exciting than the average headline . We have recently been told a good deal about the suppression of a certain play in New York . According to one newspaper account , a reporter , interviewing the authoress , asked her why , instead of making the murder of revenge take a peculiarly revolting form , she could not have let the avenging brother shoot the protagonist . Her reply was completely honest . Shooting , she averred , was so common that there was no kick in it ; she simply had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were told of a curious outbreak of superstition in New York State , the mayor of a town having accused the local rabbi , by implication at least , of ritual murder . Just why this particular medieval accusation should have been revived ? should , that is , have been susceptible of revival ? in the twentieth-century United States is hard to determine . I suspect that it is really because we are more prone at the present moment than at any time , these many generations , to assume the casual presence among us of violent and unnatural crimes . There is some reason besides individual ignorance for a suspicion of the sort ; it could not be harbored by the average citizen except in a world that was hardened to horrors . The notion of ritual murder was to the accuser shocking but not impossible ? not , that is , so shocking as to be impossible . We demand knockouts ; we get knockouts ; and our emotions are roused by nothing less . We deal , easily and habitually , in terms of violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Last summer , at Braves Field in Boston , thirty thousand citizens assembled to see Jack Dempsey enter the ring in a business suit and announce a brace of contests . The week before , only forty thousand people had gone to the Yankee Stadium to see Tunney defend his title . No wonder Tunney quit ! Mr. W. 0 . McGeehan will tell us , any day ? and does tell us , most days ? just how superior Tunney is , in every way , to Dempsey . The fact remains that no one is interested in Tunney , except Mr. McGeehan and a few professors of English , whereas a legend appears to be forming round Dempsey that promises to parallel the old John L. Sullivan legend . The reason is Dempsey 's murderous power . What is boxing compared with a punch ? The vogue of prize fighting , " even among intellectuals and gentlefolk , " has been taken as a sign of our times . Certainly the Dempsey legend is being fostered by people of a different class from those who fostered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preponderatingly from among the vulgar and the criminal . It is no longer " low " to be a devotee of the " sweet science . " Part of this is due to the improved status of boxing , which is no longer illegal and furtive . The days of " Gallegher " are over . Nor would any fighter of the type of John L. Sullivan be popular nowadays , punch or no punch . Since boxing has become " big business , " the sot can keep no place in it . The successful fighter , in the champion or challenger class , is wooed by big purses . The corollary of that is that such a fighter has heavy responsibilities laid on him . He must be frugal , or he can not afford the elaborate training he needs ; he must be temperate and he must be continent , or he will be beaten by theman who is both . These conditions are due in part to a superior and disseminated athletic knowledge , and to more rigid rules of the ring ; in part , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive whitewashing of the pugilistic business . But all that does not wholly suffice to explain ; nor could Tex Rickard himself drag us to the Coliseum if the Coliseum were not precisely where we wanted to go . We arc tired of delicate pleasures , because they no longer excite us ; we need heavier sedatives and more powerful stimulants . ( Contract bridge , even , is displacing auction . ) The small stakes , the gentle contests , the simple pleasures fail to quicken us . More beasts out of Africa , more spectacular perils , and ? unquestionably ? more blood . I will not go so far as to say that we are " death-intoxicated " ; but I think it is true that there must be a drop of death in the cup . . . . Some newspapers stated recently ( how accurately I do not know ) that the press of requests to be allowed to witness Hickman 's execution in Los Angeles was so great that large numbers would have to be refused . The day before the execution , the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present . I am ignorant of the laws that govern these occasions ; I had not even been aware that any but the necessary witnesses were admitted to scenes of execution . Yet , obviously , a large fraction of that hundred must have consisted of people who were there as a matter of interest or pleasure , not as a matter of inescapable duty . The state can not possibly have required a hundred witnesses to Hickman 's death . There is a play at present running in New York , I understand , which deals with a parallel to the Snyder case ; and the audience , I believe , is permitted to witness , if not the electrocution itself , the instants so literally penultimate that people go away feeling as if they had endured to the last . Who goes willingly to such a play , I do not know ? not I. Probably the persons who , if they had been in California , would have been working any " pull " they had to sec Hickman die . Death has lost its dignity among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of us are likely to be shot at any time : the gangster 's gun , the prohibition agent 's pistol may get . the " innocent bystander " at any moment . If we are to be thrilled by death , we must get it in a peculiarly shocking form ; if we are to be thrilled by anything short of death , it must be the menace of death where death does not properly belong . III The stream of biographies of hard characters is probably part of the popular process of debunking history . The debunking works both ways : they whitewash as many people as they blacken . If Mr. Lytton Strachey does his best to cheapen Cardinal Manning and Florence Nightingale and General Gordon , other gentlemen have been busy publishing the virtues of Captain Kidd , John Brown , Lucrezia . Borgia , and Heliogabalus . It is part of our " fact-facing " passion , no doubt , that the whitewashed villain should be as fashionable as the blackened hero . Anything to surprise . There is some quality in the truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Washington can stand any amount of debunking . In so far as this attitude is reaction against the stupid belief held , more or less loosely , by preceding generations , that all biography should be eulogy , it is healthy . The matter of historical writing need not detain us , though we may note the fact that both attackers and defenders are trying to make the public sit up ; to create a thrill by denying familiar conceptions . We have also a lot of pseudo-biography and near-fiction dealing with the criminal classes ; the life-histories , more or less touched up , of hoboes , gunmen , thieves , and murderers . " The villain as hero " is not new ; it is a fairly ancient literary tradition . Our tastein villains , simply , has deteriorated . Their defiance of the community is apt at present to take the more sordid physical forms ; there is no air about them of a Byronic romanticism . Drama , straight fiction , poetry , criticism , are another matter . Yet we must admit that the unclean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . The purchasers of books and theater tickets are largely drawn from the prosperous classes . Both books and theater tickets are too expensive for the poor man . It is the full-fed and the well-to-do who support the drama and buy novels at two dollars and fifty cents and biographies at five dollars . So we should expect to find the Broadway plays and the fashionable literature catering to the arena-going crowd ; providing , through other media , the desired " knockout " thrill . And they do . Though the conditions of a country life may prevent one 's being an assiduous playgoer , no one living within fifty miles of New York quite escapes Broadway . It is safe to say that I have not , for live years , seen a play ( apart from revivals of classics ) which did not base its appeal to interest on some exotic , or disreputable , or brutal ingredient or quality . The comedy of manners has died the death . When we want it ? which is rarely ? we revive something . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the drama , it also bears witness . The Theatre Guild goes in largely for foreign playwrights , and must needs filter even Ben Jonson through German before presenting him . When it gives contemporary American drama , it gives ? what ? " Porgy " and " Strange Interlude , " for example . The plays , not confessedly " thrillers , " that pretend to deal , comedy-of-manners fashion , with contemporary life , dwell on adultery , perversion , and murder . Not because contemporary life is largely based on those facts , but because contemporary interest can hardly be awakened without reference to them . They are avoidable , apparently , only if " trick " stuff is substituted . Only the unusual can stimulate the jaded ; only the very unusual can shock the hard-boiled . I have read recently ? quite by accident ? three novels by very different authors ( two of them inconspicuous ) which deal with the general uncleanness of the Sabbath . Black he-goats , it would seem , are displacing Chows . . . . There is a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the subject will disincline one forever to fictional repetition of disgusting detail . But obviously there is a market for that detail , as there is a heavy market for novels dealing with sexual pathology . Though Kraft-Ebbing may not be popular , the authors who have munitioned themselves from his pages are popular . A book review was recently brought to my notice in which the reviewer , wishing to express vague disapproval of some historical character , called him " sadistic . " ( I also recall an article by one of our best-known dramatic critics , which dealt with " masochism " in Barrie 's The Little Minister ! ) It was clear that " sadistic , " in the mind of the reviewer , was a faintly opprobrious term of no special significance . There was no proof of sadism in the career of the character under discussion ; nor did the reviewer really intend to impute it to him . He was merely searching for an adjective with a " kick " in it . He found it ! If he had ever read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be correctly applied to comparatively few people . Whether that knowledge would have deterred him or not , I can not say . As our more exciting plays and novels fail , more or less deliberately , to reflect reality , so , too , our critical vocabulary fails of accuracy . Critics , whether social or literary , are also out to thrill their audiences , and misapply words as authors distort their lenses . The contemporary twists and turns of fiction are peculiarly interesting to a person who pursues the vicarious life . It can not escape such an inquisitive reader that our fiction latterly , when it has tried to wrench itself away from the more sordid aspects of fornication , has found itself wandering clear into NoMan's-Land . I do not keep careful track of best-sellers as such ; but any newspaper reader is aware that the most recent award of the Pulitzer Prize was a frank confession of the failure of American letters to deal with the realities of American life . The Pulitzer Prize is supposed to go to that novel " which shall best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of American manners and manhood . " That the judges felt compelled to award it to a novel which does not pretend to deal with American life at all ? or , indeed , with any life outside a fairy tale ? shows the poverty of loyal American literature at the moment . So far as I know , no Pulitzer Prize novel since The Age of Innocence ( the novel which won the award in 1923 I have not read ) has complied with the terms of the award , if strictly interpreted . They have either been highly " special " in subject and appeal , or belittled American life , or exuded a miasmic sentimentality which is the negation of both realism and true idealism . The awarders of the prize have , no doubt , done their best ; and their job is to declare a comparative value . The lack lies in the material offered . Our best talent at the moment , it would seem , is being devoted to the fanciful reconstruction either of past epochs or of exotic and unimportant types . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drip sentimentality over it as a dog drips saliva over a bone . America as it is , is not being soberly considered or faithfully recorded . Here , too , the " knockout " demand prevails . One need only mention in passing the increasing vogue of fiction dealing plainly with crime . Now there is , naturally , a reason for all this . It was pointed out earlier that material comfort , widely distributed , gives a nation an opportunity either to purify or to drug itself . The American nation is apparently choosing the latter method of occupying its leisure . When one considers that the greater part of American wealth at the present day is parvenu wealth , one sees how natural this is . That the American civilization is increasingly materialistic , no one , I think , would deny ; or that its standard of selection is the plutocratic standard . It grows truer , every lustrum , that nothing counts in America so much as money . If Roman luxury had suddenly been outspread to include the mob , the same thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Among the new-rich it apparently did take place . Only aristocrats can make a spiritual use of wealth . If you suddenly bestow it on the crowd that has been demanding " bread and circuses , " that crowd will simply buy better bread and bigger circuses . The dream of the poor man is almost necessarily a materialistic dream . Governor Smith during his campaign gave us an ironic picture of the textile worker who earns less than eighteen dollars a week , going out to a chicken dinner , in his own automobile , wearing silk socks . Does anyone doubt that the first things that textile worker , suddenly enriched , would buy , are chicken dinners , automobiles , and silk socks ? And after chicken dinners , automobiles , and the feel of silk ? what ? Only in the next generation , probably , will it be the things of the mind : knowledge , taste , delicate experience . The man who has fought all his life for enough bread to keep him and his family alive will always give undue emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a necessity ; his definition sf luxury will inevitably be a superfluity sf bread . Our conception of comfort is nearly always the simple negation of whatever has caused us to suffer . With he quick turnover of American fortunes ? " shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves " ? the najority of the rich are always people unequipped for the proper evaluation of wealth . The people who know what money is good for are those who have had it long enough to learn ? and who , in most cases , have lost it . When wealth is worshipped for its untranslated self , as it is increasingly in our mammonistic civilization , they may never learn . So that luxury and ignorance may perhaps be blamed for our hard-boiled attitude . We are smothered in material comfort , and do not know enough to look for comfort of a different kind . We are , by and large , the mob enriched . Inevitably we seek the thrills that can most easily be felt and assessed . These have always been physical and nervous thrills ; and we are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns , to the multiplied contacts via news-sheets , radio , telephone , motor car , which the rural citizen now enjoys , we have a superficial sophistication that we did not have , as a nation , twenty-five years ago . The first stage of sophistication is unshockableness . The truly sophisticated person may be shocked by a hundred things that the boor never heard of and would be incapable of appraising ; but unquestionably the first step towards sophistication is the sloughing of the coarser and commoner prejudices and superstitions . With the sloughing process goes a certain naive pride in release . The hard-boiled person is the one who is conscious of having abandoned many native prejudices and is at the stage of thinking that inability to be shocked is the whole story . The truly sophisticated man is perhaps not so very hard-boiled . As a community , we are hard-boiled . Enough said . The fact accounts for the kind of physical and nervous titillation we seek . We are jaded on the threshold of experience because our emancipation is , after all , mainly physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience , and , thanks to newspapers and news-reels , we are aware as never before of man 's unremitting and terrific contest with nature ? all the faits divers of the cosmos . Our imaginations are pretty well eabined in the physical ; therefore , they respond most easily to physical stimuli and , in art and literature , to physical implications ? homicide and sex , for the most part . The younger generation must bear its share of blame in the matter . No one is a more passionate partisan than I of the honesty , the charm , the wit , the intellectual sensitiveness of the aforesaid younger generation . I think them on the whole preferable to my own generation at the same age . Their chief vice is the vice of all youth in all times ? ignorance . It is not to be expected that boys and girls , young men and women , should have the poise , the judgment , the sense of values of maturity . If they could ? then this mundane adventure would indeed be ironic beyond endurance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it teaches us nothing ? It is not of youth 's ignorance that we have a right to complain ; rather , of youth 's predominance . Never has youth been so articulate or so listened to ; never has a generation rushed into creation and criticism so early , won a public so early , dictated so early , what older people shall see , read , think , and discuss . Now , youth ? all youth , always ? is at the stage where we have said the community at large now finds itself : proud of its emancipation and desirous of thrills . Every mature person knows that young things can endure what older people can not . It is in youth that we can bear horrors ; it is in youth that we can thoroughly enjoy the presentation of morbidness , murder , starvation , suicide , cruelty , and insanity . It is in our youth that we can read Russian literature . Not long ago a young man took me to a movie which included a scene of torture . As the painful preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were shut , I heard him murmur , " This is getting good . " The difference between us was not one of temperament but one of experience . The longer one has lived , the more one shrinks from the unnecessary coutemplation of pain , because one knows all about the prevalence of pain . Reminders of pain are reminders of actuality . The most terrible fictitious events are , as one is only too acutely aware , counterparts of something that has happened a thousand times , and is probably happening even now , somewhere . To inexperienced youth nothing is a reminder ; these horrors they cheerfully and with interest endure because to them they are unreal . Youth is tender-hearted , but the range of its pity is narrow like its experience . It sympathizes truly only with what it understands ? which is little . I think the prevalence of violent thrills in our contemporary representations of life is partly due to the present importance of youth , both as artist and audience . V All these are tentative answers to the " why " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural course of seeking ever more violent physical and nervous stimuli ; youth , forcing upon us excitements which only the young ? and , among the mature , the insensitive ? can endure ; the fact that we live in an age of easy miracles , wherein our attention . and praise are constantly being captured , not by some achievement of the spirit , but by some new process out of a laboratory . These are sufficient explanation , it would seem . Some critics would add to these the progressive paganizing of America , which certain acute observers have declared to be startlingly rapid . Whether America is paganizing itself at such a rate , I am not qualified to determine ; though obviously most of our contemporary art could be accepted only by pagans . If someone asks : what of the millions who are said recently to have decided an election largely on religious and moral prejudice ? one can only reply that , in the first place , those millions are Christians in a very special and dubious sense , and , in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies , and novels that are almost indistinguishable from movies . They are not the perusers of Ernest Hemingway and Robinson Jeffers , or the spectators of " The Shanghai Gesture " and " Diamond Lil . " By the same token , I do not know just how hard-boiled they are . In any case , they do not control our fiction , our art , our drama , our poetry , our history , our criticism ? or our arenas . They are , perhaps , preponderant in the movie clientele ; but such strange things are happening to the movies just now that it would be vain to deduce anything either from , or about , movie audiences . The admission just made ? that the mob does not control the artistic and critical output of the country ? may seem to imply that one is wrong in considering the enriched mob to be responsible . It is , someone may well say , only the intellectuals , the aristocrats who can make either certain doctrines or certain pastimes fashionable . What of the people who , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patricians ? Well : what about the intellectual patricians ( if there are any ) who guide our taste ? It can have escaped no one , I think , that in all the arts they are guiding us away from realism and away from beauty . They are certainly not keeping us out of the Coliseum , or trying to teach us a greater sensitiveness . They are hard-boiled , too . Some of them have followed Mr. Mencken in preferring " guts " and shock to proportion and sanity . Mr. Mencken certainly must take his share of blame for corrupting taste among us . Under cover of a few truths he has slipped in a lot of lies ; in courageously and rightly denouncing hypocrisy , he has shoved under our noses a lot of second-rate stuff . He is right in demandng " guts " ? IEsehylus , Dante , Shakespeare have plenty of " guts " ; but he 7 .. cannot deny , I think , that he wants the ; tits all over the place . Whereas , in theactual organism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver Age in Roman letters , the chief characteristics of which , I understand , were cleverness and rhetorical insincerity , came , with Hadrian 's advent , the " African Latinity . " Rome , at that time , was very hard-boiled . This was " the period of affected archaisms and pedantic learning , combined at times with reckless love of innovation and experiment , resulting in the creation of a large number of new formations and in the adoption of much of the plebeian dialect . " I offer nothing of my own knowledge : I merely quote classical authorities . Anyone will admit , I think , that every one of these recorded traits of the African Latinity is strikingly matched in our own contemporary verse and prose . 1 spoke earlier of certain " tcnuitics and caducities " in our literature that seemed to be declining towards an age of pure sham . Leaving the poetry to one side , any reader of contemporary prose ( and our prose is better than our verse ) will find , if he stops to examine what he reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of innovation and experiment , the new formations , the plebeian dialect , in our most popular pages . Each cited trait leaps to affix itself to some one of our most praised authors . Our hard-boiledness has turned us away from classic moderation and classic profundity . After all , the classic tradition is to deal with life truthfully , and we are not , at present , very keen about truth . We want , like all hard-boiled people , an escape from life , and are impatient of what have been tiresomely but accurately called " the eternal verities . " Do books like Lady into Fox , Lolly Willows , The High Places ? I pull names at random out of my memory -- The Venetian Glass Nephew , Mr. Fortune 's Maggot , Porgy , A Mirror for Witches , The Cabala , My Mortal Enemy , The Sun Also Rises , The Bridge of San Luis Rey , Orlando attempt in any way to deal with life as it typically and eternally is ; to do more than make us forget , for an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth are from far places ? we seem at the moment to be growing less able to endure any truth that comes near to us . The immense recent vogue of mystery and detective stories is merely a frank avowal that , while we want a " kick , " we do not want a " kick " that will start us thinking . It is our nerves , not our minds , that we offer as subjects for experiment . One soon gets to the point , with any form of physical and nervous stimulus , to go beyond which is to break some law . Censors and legislators are always looking out to see that we do not drug ourselves too deeply . We have not . the social freedom of the old patricians . Hence the spectacle of our purveyors of entertainment , who are trying to see just how much they can " get away with , " blurring their audacities by a certain remoteness of subject . It is pretty generally conceded that you may be as indecent as you like if you saddle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pathologic ( and , therefore , irresponsible ) condition . This remoteness of subject is bad for us , since it keeps us from being really critics of life ; but it is the only device which permits certain thrills to be brought to us . Since the eighteenth century , the exotic has never been so fashionable as now . Exoticism , indeed , is always fashionable when the public consciousness is generally hard-boiled . Partly for the eternal hope ofsomething new and , therefore , exciting , in it ; partly because the hard-boiled person is always seeking escape from life as he knows it , which bores him . The penalties we pay for over-developing this taste are callousness to the common and universal ( those eternal verities ) , preciosity , affectation , conscious vulgarity , violence . For by exoticism one does not mean simply chinoiseries : one means any deliberate departure from laws and standards that have been slowly evolved out of the racial experience since our civilization began . When nerves grow exacting , and imagination wears thin , the platitude is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered ; it is only clothed in a different formula . Nothing is easier and less helpful than to say of " hard-boiledness " that we should do well to get over it . No one in a hard-boiled generation gets over it except by acquiring a philosophy ? I will not say a religion . As long as our chief national heroes are captains of industry , we shall not easily do that . More than ever ? yes , in this heyday of organization ? only the individual can emancipate himself , train himself , as a strictly individual job , to taste in solitude the secret , forgotten , eternal pleasures of the regulated mind , and taste held true . Then , when the barbarians rush in upon us , he can at least perish , not as a legitimate and pulpy prey , but as a quiet martyr to something they never heard of .
