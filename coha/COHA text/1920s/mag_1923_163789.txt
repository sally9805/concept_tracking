President Barrows , formerly President of the University of California , told the Association of American Universities that success in student activities was one of the best criteria of fitness . He said : " I have followed for about ten years now the course of men who obtain prominent positions in what we sometimes derisively call students ' activities . ' Almost without exception those men are not only successful in their business of life , but in almost every case they are influential and important men in the communities in which they live . " The gentleman who , under the name of Quadwrangler , writes educational gossip for the Boston Transcript , disagrees . He thinks the successful undergraduate is such merely because of an excess of the competitive spirit , whereas the true student is such because he " must " - his simple doom is to be scholarly . Without coming to blows with the venerable Bostonian , it is possible to point out that he is , unfortunately , quite wrong . It is as possible to be a great halfback because one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like reasons . There once was a race of people known as the Greeks-but Quadwrangler knows all about them . He merely forgets .
