The gradual , persistent tendency of French politics toward the left was shown again last week , when , for the first time , a Socialist was elected to the third highest* political post in the Republic : the Presidency of the Chamber . <P> The new " Third President , " M. Ferdinand Buisson ; won his election last week by the clean cut vote of 284 to 186 . He represents the " Locarnoist " policy of Foreign Minister Briand , and defeated for his new post the onetime " Ruhrist " War Minister of Premier Poincar , M. Andr Maginot . Frenchmen were pleased by the elevation of M Buisson last week , for he has held the thankless Vice-Presidency of the Chamber for the past two years with tact , polish , souplesse . <P> The Senate later unanimously elected as its President whitebearded Paul Doumer , lifelong friend of Aristide Briand , and Finance Minister in a recent Briand Cabinet ( TIME , March 15 ) . Both men were extremists in their youth , long since turned safer , saner . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers ( " Premiership " ) .
