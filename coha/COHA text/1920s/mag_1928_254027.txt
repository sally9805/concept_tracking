Last week in Atlanta , Ga. , at the annual putting-heads-together of William Randolph Hearst 's 27 newspapers , a genial 54-year-old colonel was introduced . He was the new general manager , William Franklin Knox , with complete charge of editorial and business policies , responsible to no order except the occasional bulls of Mr. Hearst . Not since the ascendency of Solomon Solis Carvalho in 1917 had a Hearstling been given such wide powers . Col. Knox is a believer in tabloid journalism . Also he is expected to tour the U. S. with an eye to making the Hearst dailies more intensely local , less standardized . <P> Col. Knox fought with the Rough Riders in the Spanish American War ; in the artillery in the World War . As publisher of the Boston American , he came under the wing of Mr. Hearst a year ago .
