O'Neill &; Andreyev <P> Sirs : <P> On Feb. 12 , 1914 , a group of very young Russians , seated on a marble terrace above the sea ( quite in Elinor Glyn 's best manner ) discussed every subject under the sun , including literature and its High Priest , Leonid Andreyev . On Feb. 12 , 1928 ( remembered as the birthday of one of them ) , a group of not-so-young Russians sat in an attic overlooking chimney pots ( in the best starving-artist manner ) , and discussed art-or rather the lack of it-in the U. S. A. <P> I spare you the translation of our remarks : they were not in the best lo-the-poor-immigrant manner . But at length I said- " Oh well , God is merciful even to this benighted land . The mantle of our Andreyev has fallen upon Eugene O'Neill ; while he lives and writes , U. S. A. may boast of a literature far beyond would-be psychological excursions into sordid Main Streets . I am expecting a new weekly magazine of news ; possibly it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news press . " <P> The next morning-Feb. 13-I got my first number of your TIME . For the first time in my life I saw the pictured face of Eugene O'Neill : on my writing table was a . . . portrait of Andreyev . I placed my hand over the lower part of O'Neill 's face , and our Leonid 's eyes confronted me , his fine brow and wave of dark hair ( tidier , though ) . As to my hopeful expectation regarding TIME it is more than satisfied . . . . <P> <P> S. H. MILORADOVITCH <P> Cambridge , Mass . <P> <P> " Please Explain " <P> Sirs : <P> I may be obtuse , but I must say I fail to catch the meaning of the title under Senator Walsh 's picture this week ( TIME , March 12 ) . You say he is " Mrs. Harriman 's helper " when the article alongside says that Mrs. Harriman helped him . Please explain . <P> <P> FRANK R. OTIS <P> Plainfield , N. J. <P> <P> TIME , the newsmagazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error which apologies can not erase . The caption should have read : " Mrs. Harriman helped . " - ED . <P> <P> Void of Humor <P> Sirs : <P> Is it possible that you could expect any dog fancier to subscribe for or advertise in a magazine that could countenance or publish such an ignorant , derisive , misleading article as appeared in your SPORT column , Feb. 27 issue , under the caption of " Putting on the Dog " ? <P> It is even void of humor , the only thing that could possibly have excused its appearance in print , and contains only enough of official data to make it more insidiously poison to the uninitiated in its apparent effort to condemn the dog , the exhibitor and the bench show , and since the owners of the kennels you have listed are good sports and real lovers of the dog , you may be assured that they will feel the same about this article , uninteresting to the sportsman and misleading to the public . <P> Nor do I see how it could be possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnificent setting ; almost faultless management ; unprecedented attendance ; the wonderful collection of highly bred , superbly conditioned and groomed animals enthusiastically handled , in many instances , by some of America 's most representative men and women who can not be fittingly termed " haggard , dirty or inarticulate .
