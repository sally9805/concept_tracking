But the smoke had hardly cleared when clouds of official disapproval rose to blur the brilliance of his honors . Not only did the metropolitan papers cast bitter reflections on the verdict of Judges Charles E. Miles , Charles Meighan and Referee Patsy Haley , but William Muldoon himself , Chairman of the State Athletic Commission , declared the decision " unjustifiable " . He stated , however , that the verdict was official and that the State Commission would stand by it . Accordingly , Tunney will retain his doubtful honors until he takes clear title to the championship in another fight with Greb . <P> Madison Square Garden was jammed for the battle , which went the full fifteen rounds without the suggestion of a knockout . Tunney carried the thumping to his opponent 's ribs and body until they were a mass of fevered blotches . Greb , who resides in Pittsburgh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butting Tunney with his head . Tunney took the decision on points .
