IT was late at night . All were asleep except four of us ? three prisoners and myself . We were smoking our pipes and drinking tea in the warden 's kitchen and talking . Our conversation ranged over many things ? things that are weird and fascinating when the mood of a silently creeping night has settled upon an isolated community . Suddenly I turned to one of the prisoners and said , ? ' Jack , how do you like working here ? ' He looked at me for a minute and replied Well , I like to work for the old man Mr. Osborne ; he is a clean-cut fellow , and you always get a square deal from him ; but in here I am a servant . ' And then , pointing through the window where , in the distance , broken by a few glimmering lights , loomed the prison in outlines blacker than the night , he continued , ' While there , I am a citizen . ' Puzzled at his answer , I asked for an explanation ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be simple . Here I have to do what I am told , just like any other servant ; in there we govern ourselves as free men . ' A paradoxical state of mind for a convict , if one remembers the old prison system . Under the old prison system the privilege of working in the warden 's house was the final mark of confidence and the most cherished of all privileges . Here , apparently , while the boys liked to work for their warden , they regretted the fact that they were not active participants in managing their own affairs as they would be if they remained in the prison proper . This sentiment was concurred in by the other men . While thus smoking our pipes and drinking tea , I was initiated into many of the mysteries of prison democracy ? one of them , the keen sense of responsibility . I was told by one of the boys in the kitchen ? a fellow with a smug face and bald head , with many fanciful tattoos on his arms and chest ? that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the chief trouble was that some of the men who had short bits ' did not appreciat e their full responsibility . At the last election , he told me , they had three tickets in the field : those who were in office and wanted to stay in ; the independents who would have liked to get in ; and the long-timers . I inquired for the distinctive platform of the long-timers ' party . ' Well , ' he said , we fellows have most to lose if this system goes wrong . We are going to stay here after the others are gone , and it is up to us to see that nothing goes wrong , because we are the responsible party . ' sauntered into the prison one day , and found myself in the League room , with half a dozen boys . An argument developed about the efficacy or the democratic method , and I found to my great surprise that democracy had staunch supporters here , of auncher than in some places that I know outside of prison . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fellow with broad shoulders , and a voice like that of a bull , husky and sturdy ? said , with a bang on the table , Well , be gad , I never worked in my life , but when I get through here I am going to try it , and I am going to be a labor agitator . ' That was curious . I somehow could not think of Mack as a labor agitator . I said , ' A labor agitator , Mack ! Why in the world that ? ' Mack had never been a laborer . He had been a thief all his life . He looked at me with some scorn . ' Well , why not ? ' said he . ' I tell you boys , this thing , democratic self-government , is the cure for all our troubles , and I am going to preach it when I get out . ' A little later in the day I was talking to one of the men doing time ? a young man , straight , well-built , blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Technically , he never completed it , having been expelled from some halfa-dozen colleges in succession . He told me quite frankly what the trouble was . He said , ' I had too much money and too little sense of proportion . I ant the black sheep in my family . I was never any good , but I tell you what ? when I leave this place , I ant going to preach the gospel of a square deal , and I am going to do it for the rest of my life . This is the first time I have seen it applied in practice , and it works . I have found a life 's job . ' One day I found myself talking to a farmer lad . His sentence was two years . I wanted his opinion , He said , ' Well , two years is a pretty long time for a fellow to spend any place , especially in prison ; but I tell you what , I ai n't so sorry that I am here . This is the greatest experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been hate than in all my other years put toget her , and I feel the better for it . ' Sitting with two professors from Hoc . yard , who were visiting the prison , and watching a trial where five young lads , all under twenty-one , acted as judges , while a number of witnesses were being called , I observed the young boys , one of whom , who was doing life for murder , was the presiding judge . The judge was saying , as one of the witnesses went out , in answer to an object ion that there seemed to be no evidence justifying the continuance of the trial , ' Tint is not the point . I do n't think the fellow was guilty myself , but I do think some of these witnesses are lying , and the point , fellows , is , that we have got to learn to tell the truth or this darn machine wo n't work . ' One of the professors turned to me and said , rather wistfully , ' If we mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our educational machine would achieve ! ' Something strange and phenomenal had occurred just before I visited the prison . Nine motors filled with prisoners had gone to Manchester , Nov Hampshire , to give a play . They were practically without guard . On the way home , late at night , a blizzard developed , and in making a sharp turn in the road the two first cars , one with Mr. Osborne and the one immediately behind , took the right road , the others went astray . Mr. Osborne arrived at the prison with seven cars of prisoners missing . The other cars kept straggling in one by one as they found the war , the last one arriving about ten o'clock in the morning , One group of prisoners had a particularly trying time of it . They ran out of gasoline , their car broke down se , end times , and finally burned , leaving them stranded and practically without money . In despair they waked a farmer and inquired for the county jail , planning to spend the night there and return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a little town , from which a bus service was running in the direction of Portsmouth , and waiting until morning for the bus to start , they ' found that they had to borrow money to get back to the prison , as the little they had had been spent for gasoline . They all arrived safely at the prison by tell o'clock . One of them was a life-prisoner and another was doing twenty years ; yet they had made no attempt to run away . Why ? I do n't know very well , and the men do n't seem to , either . There is , however , a glimmer of explanation . I talked to the lifer and asked him why in the world he had not run away , and he said , ' What do you mean ? run away ? How the devil could I take the respoitsibililyof leaving the men behind me to suffer the consequences of my having betrayed their trust in me ? I went bemuse they sent me , and if I had not come back they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any apparent strain at all , ' Why , the idea of running away never came into my head . I was sent to participate in a play and help raise some money for the boys . I enjoyed doing it , and I just came back as I was expected to ? and that 's all . ' After a little silence he added , ' We had so much trouble that night , we were so worried about how we would get back , that when we finally did come near the prison , we felt that home never looked better . It was the most natural thing for us to come back , and we did not think of anything else . The thing that I wanted most was to get a little rest , and then to tell the rest of the boys all about it . ' ? The boy of good family mentioned above was one of those who went on t his trip . He said to me , ' This is an experience that I will never forget . There we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and free to run away , and yet no one did . What is more , I am sure if anyone had tried to do it , the others would have prevented him . There was a peculiar feeling of responsibility and of joy in carrying out the implication of this responsibility that exceeds anything I have ever believed to be possible . You see we were all free men ? at least , free to run away ; but our responsibility carried us back t o prison , and yet you might almost say that We found our freedom in going back to confinement . Curious , is n't it ? Almost ridiculous to think that men free to enjoy the possibilities of a life without restraint should return voluntarily to imprisonment just because they had a strong feeling of attachment to the men they left behind . Probably , too , there was also in our minds the knowledge that the rest would suffer if we failed them , and you know , there is n't a single one of us who regrets having come back , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of us richer . I guess that we all came back because we were expected to and bemuse everyone was sure that we would . ' One day in Auburn , as the sun was setting over the walls , and the dim shadows of the coming night were settling down on the prison , I stood with Tony in a corner and watched the men in gray pass by on their way from the shops to their cells . Tony is a young fellow , about twenty-one , a little above medium height , broad-shouldered , well-knit , thick neck , round head , keen blue eyes , with a remarkably boyish face on which the lines of character and strength are just beginning to develop . He has a record of being one of the worst gangsters in New York City . From the age of fifteen on he dominated one of the large gangs on the upper West Side . He dominated it on the basis of personality . He proved himself the quickest , the bravest , the cleverest and the most honest ? honest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty . Brought up in a family where the father was dead and the mother was poor , in an atmosphere where gangsters and professional eriminals dominated . his environment , he learned the fine art of being a professional criminal at an early age , and he learned it well . He knew nothing else . He had little schooling , and little experience beyond the horizon of his own immediate group , but that group he dominated . He had been tried on charges of various kinds , including murder , before this , but never convicted . Either he was too clever , or the witnesses were too much afraid of him , or , probably , he was never really ' caught with the goods . ' Be that as it nifty , he was serving his first term in a slate prison . Let me say that Tony was worshiped by his own group as a leader and loved as a friend . I was standing there and talking with him when he turned to me suddenly and said , ' You know , Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " argue " with a man . ' It dawned on me slowly that he was really saying that this was the first time in his life when a. difference of opinion did not involve a fight : that he could ' argue ' with a man when he disagreed with him , rather than fight with him . As the men kept filing by , he said , ' You know , when I first was elected top sergeant I was in a terrible fix . I wanted to punch everybody in the nose who broke the rules ; but I knew that , if I punched him in the nose for breaking the rules , I be breaking them no , elf : and I could n't do it . It was really a terrible thing . I wanted to give up the job , but I stuck it out . ' Then , with half a smile , ' You know , I think it did me a lot of good to stick it out . ' These are some of the evidenem : I could multiply them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience , and the necessity for it . But enough has already been said , I think , to make the reader ask the question , ' What in the world is it that makes the criminal , as we know him , behave in this paradoxical fashion ? These men certainly do not sound like criminals or talk like them . And if not , why not ? ' Well , that is a question which this article is going to try to answer , It is a hard question to answer , and the answer is bound to be unsatisfactory . To understand fully the significance of democratic organization in the prison , we must understand the criminal before he comes to prison . The real criminal problem is the professional criminal , the man who has , for one reason or another , accepted law-breaking as a regular method of making a living . He is the criminal problem . Obviously , he is not the only one who gets into jail ; but any prison procedure must be judged primarily by its nth . ence upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have known them inside and out , tend to divide themselves into six fairly distinct classes , which overlap , it is true , yet each of which is sufficiently distinct to stand as a group , marked off from the other groups . The first is what might be described as the casual criminal : the man who , having once committed a crime and been discovered , is probably never go-ma to repeat the offense ; the man who is steak rat her than bad , who slipped under pressure and whose sensitive cons. ? iousness and feelings of shame , as well as other influences , such as home and family , tend to keep him from re-tea t ? the act , he act once he has escaped , or suffered , the consequences of his first breach of the law . The second , and a very large , part of the prison population must be classed as economic criminals . When I was at Illackwell 's Island , in 1914 and 1915 , the prison population of that institution increased one half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true of that penitentiary was true of all the other criminal institutions of New York City , as I was informed by the Commissioner of Correction . It will be remembered that the winter of 1914-15 was one of the hardest we have had in a long time , New York City alone having some half a million men unemployed for many months . The statistics for last year , which have just been published , show a remarkable decline in the criminal population of New York . It was a comparatively prosperous year , and them was little unemployment . This seems to indicate that economic conditions have a direct bearing on the prison population . How much more it could be reduced by improving economic conditions still further , we can not say . But it does seem obvious that in all probability the prison population will tend to decline with the improvement in the general economic background of the men who are to-day in prison . We thus have a definite group of men who get into jail when conditions fall below a certain level , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This group must necessarily affect all the remaining groups . The recidivist can not be considered altogether immune from the influ mice of a changing economic situation . The third group , a group much more characteristic of the workhouse and the penitentiary than of the state prison , is one that might be described as derelicts . Not all men can pass the test of industrial civilization , and they break . Non-employment , sickness , accident , and other factors tend to develop irregular habits , nervous temperament . irritability , and lack of interest . They become the driftwood of the community , and some of them ? one might almost say the best ? drift into jail . There was an old man in the penitentiary whom we used to call ' Pop . ' For some twelve years he had come back every winter and left in the spring . I got to the penitentiary in February . He left in April and returned at the beginning of November , and I left him there when I was released in March of the next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come back to this place so often ? ' And he replied , ' Well , my boy , what can an old man do ? I ai n't got no home , no family ; nobody wants an old man , and the work is too hard , even if I could get it . I am not a strong man any more . When spring conies I go across the river to the heights , sleep in a barn , mow a lawn here and there , chop a little wood , and get by . When it gets cold again , I come back to the city , take a few good drinks , then break a window and get six months in the " pen. ? In this place I am at least sure of a bed and kept out of the cold . ' ' But , ' said I , ' why do n't you go to a charity institution ? ' ' Who ? me ? You must think I am a beggar . I tell you what , young fellow , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rather be in jail any day than in a charity home . ' ' Pop ' is not an isolated instance . He . is a type of the men and women who help to fill our city jails , and some of whom ultimately get into state prisons . They are the defeated in the struggle for life . The fourth class is the accidental criminal : the man who runs counter to the law by accident , often the accident of good intention . In a fight that is innocent enough , a blow may be struck which has fatal consequences . Or it may be that some friend has broken the law , and in seeking to escape the police appeals for protection , for the hiding of stolen goods . The arrest of the criminal involves the well-intentioned friend , who is convicted of having received stolen goods . To this class belongs also the man who , in a passion or a fight , has struck a blow which had a worse consequence than lie planned . Many men behind the bars belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , a man continues to conic through choice , a choice determined by the loss of social position , the ruin of his fortune , the acquisition of new habits , the making of new friends , the perversion of morals , the development of a feeling of hatred and revenge . A criminal record is a kind of branding of both the soul and the body . The man becomes marked , and often the police and officials help determine the destiny of the forces which an accident set in motion . The fifth class is the definitely sick ? and thereare such men in prison , though not all the sick ones are there , and , in spite of the popular impression , not all who are in prison are sick . I use the word ' sick ' in the sense given to it by men who speak of crime as a disease , or of the criminal as diseased . There are men who are , by native capacity and content , not fit or able to live a normal life within the strained conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically and mentally . These men belong in a hospital ? not in a jail . But they are not so important a part of the prison population as the prison psychiatrist generally tends to indicate . The psychiatrist 's condosions will have to be checked up by a much wider analysis of the people sta. side of prison before his description of the characteristic features of the crim. final can be accepted as conclusive . This leads its to our last class , the professional criminal . He is the centre of the prison problem . Recidivism into proof of mental inferiority , of physical deformity . The evidence of those who have been in prison and who know the criminal best ? the professional ram . inal ? is contrary to any claim that would make recidivism in itself a proof of inferiority . The professional criminal is a man who has accepted animas a profession . He has developed an aptitude for it. , a liking for it . The habit , the environment , the ties of friendship , the group adhesiveness , all tend to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orally speaking , through the open door of the juvenile institution . A discus. sion of prison democracy must be concerned with its results upon these men . The professional criminal is peculiar in the sense that he lives a very intense emotional life . He is isolated in the community . He is in it , but not of it . His social life ? for all men are social ? is narrow ; but just because it ism , row , it is extremely tense . He Ines a life of warfare and has the psychology of the warrior . He is at war with the whole community . Except his very few friends in crime he trusts no one and fears everyone . Suspicion , fear , hatred , danger , desperation and passion are present in a more tense form in his life than in that of the average individual . He is restless , ill-humored , easily mused and suspicious . He lives on the brink of a deep precipice . This helps to es plain his passionate hatred , his brutal . itv , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead men tell no tales . He holds on to his few friends with a strength and passion rare among people who live a more normal exist-pt op enee . His friends stand between him and discovery . They are his hold upon life . his basis of security . ? Loyalty to one 's group is the basic law in the underworld . Disloyalty is treason and punishable by death ; for disloyalty may mean the destruction of one 's friends ; it'inay mean the hurling of the criminal over the precipice on which his whole life is built . To the community the criminal is aggressive . To the criminal his life is one of defense primarily . The greater part of his energy , of his hopes , and of his successes , centres around escapes , around successful flight , around proper catering-up of his tracks , and around having good , loyal , and trustworthy friends to participate in his activities , who will tell no tales and keep the rest of the community outside . The criminal is thus , from his own point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? living a life of defensive warfare with the community ; and the odds are heavy against him . He therefore builds up a defensive psychology against it ? a psychology of boldness , bravado , and self-justification . Thegood criminal ? which means the successful one , he who has most successfully carried through a series of depredatMns against the enemy , the common enemy , the public ? is a hero . He is recognized as such , toasted and feasted , trusted and obeyed . But always by a little group . They live in a world of their own , a life of their own , with ideals , habits , outlook , beliefs , and associations which are peculiarly fitted to maintain the morale of the group . Loyalty , fearlessness , generosity , willingness to sacrifice one 's self , perseverance in the face of prosecution , hatred of the common enemy ? these are the elements that maintain the morale , but all of t hem are pointed against the community as a whole . The criminal is not conscience-stricken , because his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre around the conviction that dishonesty ( against the community ) is the best policy , and more , that dishonesty is a characteristic prevailing element among other people ; that the difference between the criminal who has been in jail and the rest of the community is that they are yet . to be in jail . This leads us to the criminal 's background . Where does he come from ? How does he acquire this peculiar concentration of the qualities characteristic of most other people , in this perverted but intense form ? The average professional criminal begins his career as a boy , often as d child ; a had boy , a naughty , turbulent , energetic , and noisy child . Some of them begin their lives of ' crime ' as early as the age of seven . More than twenty per cent of our criminals are under twenty-one . Raised most often as he is in poor families , in overcrowded rooms , the young boy receives little care and attention . At a very early age he generally is left to roam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has his meals  --  poor meals , often irregular ones and dirty . He lives in the street with other boys situated like himself , and they organize into gangs . Each little boy is striving for leadership , and fights are constant . Not living his life at home , he lives it in the street . He plays craps , collects pictures , trades , bargains , steals , avoids the policeman , hears stories of brave crirhinals , and being poor , finds means of increasing his expenditures for sweets , moving-pictures , and other boyish extravagances by illicit games and by being introduced to the practice of older boys . This is the setting for the qwq He was a kindly old fellow , with a twinkle . in his eye , and I asked him , ' Duth , how do you feel about the game , anyway/ ' ? Well , ' be replied , . ' my boy , when vouce been in jail as long as F have , you ilon-t feel much about what you do to other people who ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few friends , and when he is released tlwse generally become the centre of his emotional existence . He is a little more callous , a little more hardened , a little more set . He has felt his first tinge of bitterness , of hatred , of fear . He has resented brutality , and become brutal in the process , because resentment , when it breaks itself on a stone wall , hardens . Too often he comes back without . a trade , Without interests , wit h a had name , with lurking distrust in all about him , with the police , the parole officer , and all the ' good ' people just a little different in their behavior toward him ; and he feels different , and feeling . different , he is different . He finds that he has few friends , and these few ? are : - like himself , isolated , suspected , and persecuted . A sense of grievance binds them together . They become friends in all things . They build a loyalty that resists the encroachments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both on common danger and on a sense of common grievance . There is no social consciousness , because there ar-g-no broad social connections . There is no social interest because there is no broad sense of responsibility . They are ' bad , ' but they are bad in the sense that their good instincts have been distorted to bad motive , and not in the sense that they have no good instincts . This then is a general background of the professional criminal , and to this background we must always remember to add the sense of constant danger and fear with which the life of the criminal is darkened . IV Let us see this criminal as he is when he comes to prison under the democratic organization . He has been in prison before , generally , and he knows what to expect . He finds just the opposite situation from what he has known . Instead of discipline , hard and brutal . he finds discipline based on cooperation and democratic participation . He does not understand what it means . He does not believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of it . Wit h his background of suspicion , of hatred , of distrust , he brings with himself into prison a peculiarly aggravated sensitiveness . As a rat trapped and confined , before confinement has become a habit , gnaws at the cage and exhibits elements of desperate exasperation , so the criminal , suddenly cut off from a thousand associations , a world full of possibilities of joys and pleasures , which now seem more vivid , more keen , more essential , just because they have become impossible , feels unstrung , broken , and , one might almost say , crucified . He is in no mood for the understanding of democratic organization , with its demands upon personal interest and good will . Relief , which he must have , comes slowly , and generally it comes through building a fantasy of revenge , of retaliation , of self-expression and fulfillment . It is this man who comes into prison and becomes the subject of a democratic organization . This man is the criminal problem , and prison administration must stand or fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar institution . It is made up of criminals who are the citizens of this community , and yet it is not a criminal community . The men are organized on a free democratic basis , and their organization centres around problems which are peculiarly vital to the whole group . The man who originally came from a criminal community , and who under the old system was thrown into a community of criminals , now finds himself face to face , in an intensely personal way , with the grouping of men who do not operate as criminals at all ; and yet their operations are of immediate consequence upon his well-being . They operate in terms of social need . 13. cirs , are the problems - of , , got.ertatuont , administration , and discipline , of education , of sanitation , nourishment , amusement ? and these are not criminal problems . Like every community , this one contains its full measure of human strength and human he found intrigue , passion , jealousy , ambition , desire for leadership , for being in the limelight ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a busybody , to carry on reforms , to agitate for new things , to preach , to play , to build . It is a whole world , involving love and hatred , containing within itself some of the major problems of the outside world . There is , however , one basic difference . It must be remembered that this is an isolated community , a secluded community ; that men can not leave it at will , that what is done has an immediate influence upon the rest of the men . Gpverpment is a very personal experience in prison for every man there , because each man suffersor benefits irrimediatrom ' rh , s **30;219;TOOLONG **35;251;TOOLONG ? tiallysociaL From s'ucH r ! ritrarras the writer has had with prison organization he feels that if would be hard to duplicate anywhere outside of prison the social intensity and civic interest contained within a prison democracy . This paradoxical situation can probably be explained by two outstanding facts , true of the prison , but not , in their full significance , true of any other community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so keenly competitive as it is in the world at law . Men are more social because the struggle for existence in the economic sense has no place in the lives of the men behind the bars . They live a life where the danger of hunger and want , where the possibilities of lack of shelter and clothing , are unknown and undreamed of . Thereis.nastrietgle for existenkeamong the prorters against each other . This means that the hit terness and disappointment , the hatred and antagonism , the selfish , competitive character of the individual , is not so much in evidence . There is a hind of equality in the prison world which is almost unique . The prisoners live under the same conditions : they eat the same food , wear similar clothing . There is more unity of interest , more similarity of occupation , more consistency of habitual procedure , than is to be found in the outside world . What holds true of the physical appearance of the men tends to be true also of the social aspect of their existence . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their interests as prisoners are more or less the same , they benefit and suffer from the common evils of prison life . TIrigy are thus bound togethes men in the free outside world are not . This leads to the other aspect of the prison situation which makes for socialization of the individual . The group is so small , and their interests are so closely knit together , that the activities of any member have a direct influence on the well-being of all the others . There is not only greater proximity of physical contact , but greater dependence upon the social responsiveness of the individual . The interests of the group are so bound up with the behavior of the individual that he is under constant pressure to conform . The demand upon him to play the game honestly is almost irresistible . A man who stands out from the rest of the community by his unsocial behavior is in a more difficult situation than is the criminal in the outside world , In prison the man can not escape the pressure of scornful , suspicious neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows all about him . He is shunned , disliked , avoided . He is scorned and sneered at , and lacks the sympathetic support of the little group which in the world outside makes the criminal 's life bearable . He who will not play the game ' on the level ' in a prison democracy is thus an outcast who can not avoid the most serious consequence of being an outcast ? effective excommunication . The pressure for conformity in the interest of the group is thus intensified to a degree hardly imaginable . Men are caught in the vortex of a group that demands social conformity ? conformity with the things and rules which are good and essential for this self-governing group . And woe to the man who will not accept the implications of social organization . In the older prison system the honor went to the man who was the most disobedient and troublesome prisoner . ' Under the democratic organization he is a nuisance to the prison group and is treated as such . This fact tends to make the man who is-the most insistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rebellious type under the old system ? into the most social and serviceable type wider democratic organization . ' This does not mean that there is no competition , no difference , no deviation , no outlet for individual energy . But it is an outlet which must assume the form of emulation , of striving for greater service , rather than of anti-social behavior . The prison community has thus become one that literally compels men to take on the socialized character of the group . A prison democracy is the last place for criminals to practise crime . Conformity to the needs of the democratic group is the basis of existence , and conformity therefore becomes the rule , because the individual can not stand up , even if he desires to do so , against the solid will of a closely knit organization . There is another element involved , and t that is the'craving for play . It is an experience , new to most of them , which draws upon many potential characteristics . There is much fun , interest , and play in running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure in building a school system , as ' Doc . ' Meyers did in Sing Sing without ffimself having more than an elementary education . Men who have never done anything but break laws find a curious lot of self-expression in being sergeant or deputy , in making or enforcing laws . All these things have their influence . They react upon the men who are playing the game , and who , if they began doubtfully , cynically , half-humorously , soon find themselves absorbed in the real problems , because they are real problems . This is no longer a criminal community . It is a community of forrnercriminalsand present convicts , who are functioning as independent cit. - izens within a certain prescribed sphere , limited by overshadowing , walls , but within which there may be comparative freedom . It is this community that confronts the newcomer , and to him who is a stranger to it , it is a perplexing and paradoxical situation . In Sing Sing , for instance , on his arrival the man was visited by a committee , who interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was there anything he wanted to learn ? was there any particular job that he could do best , or would like to do ? Was there anything that the prison organization could do to help his family ? To the ordinary criminal this seemed like an attempt to put something over ' on biro . It was , probably , his first experience in being offered a service without being asked for a return . Generally the newcomer , with his older psychology and outlook , would take advantage of it , and the newcomer in the prison organization MIS , generally speaking , a troublesome person . However , the intensity of the situation is so great , the problems so varied , the means of outlet so numerous , the area so limited , the grouping so intense , that he finds himself drawn imnAlvortex , one might almost say arja ? Msthis will . The ptitievhich this happens is hard to describe . It differs with different men , and varies with the varying temperament . In some cases it is cataclysmic . In others it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man , for instance , is placed in a shop soon after he arrives in prison . He is still peevish , moody , discontented , upset , and morose . While there , somebody smiles at hint genially , says a cheery word to him , or picks up something that he drops . He makes a friend . In due course he will find that there is an election coming . The whole shop is busy with interest for the competing delegates ? political drumming is in the air , people are canvassing ? soliciting votes , making promises ; and he finds that his friend , or somebody . whom his friend is interested in , is running for office , and ipso facto he finds himself interested . He becomes busy , anxious , excited ; with a throbbing heart he stands on the edge of the group when the . count is taking place ; and as his friend is either defeated or successful , his heart responds with its proper beat . He is already a different man . This is the be'ginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new interests , new ambitions . Or perhaps his friend may have got into trouble , and he accompanies him to court ; and in court he finds that he can play his due part , either as a credible witness , when his word is as good as that of any other man , or as counsel pleading the cause of his friend , or as an onlooker intensely interested in the proceedings . A vision of a new world dawns upon him . A world of social problems and responsibilities , ' of which Ire was but vaguely aware before . Or he may like to play ball , and join the baseball team or a committee on baseball ; or boxing , and join a committee on boxing ; or he may have religious interests and join the CathOlic committee for the proper care of the graves ; or , if he is a Jew , he may find himself on a committee to arrange a Passover party for the boys in prison . Anything is sufficient to make a start , and . opportunities are numerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sing during Mr. Osborne 's time , about a fourth of the population serving on some committee or other , from sanitation to constitutional reform . Or he may he interested in education , going to lectures , classes , moving-pictures , or helping to teach . The particular process does not matter . What does matter is that the intensity of the social organization forces upon him social responsibility , and that the ordinary desire for conspifuousness and play , the ordinary human interest to do one ' s share in the light of the approval of one 's fellows , is sufficient to draw him out of his hard shell , to throw back into the dimness of a receding consciousness previous thoughts , previous experiences , and previous outlook , and replace them with an-altogether new set of emotions , in. terests , ideals . Under the older system the prisoner had nothing to do , so he brooded upon the past and planned vengeance far the future . At present he is so busy , the inwrests arc so various , the associations st , intense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant , that he forgets , one might almost say , that he is in prison . His whole life tends to become vibrant with an altogether new set of values and a new set of experiences . I remember sitting one night in Sing Sing with a large group of executives , board members , and other officials . It was late . The whole prison was asleep . Tim giairds were gone . except for those outside the walls . We sat in a room smoking and talking : ? talking officially , because it was a ' meeting . One of the boys got up and said , Fellows , we have to look at the prison in t his way . It does n't make any difference why we are here . That is past and gone . We ca n't leave here when we want to , either . That is not in our power . We are here to stay . Some of a ; are going to stay a long time . I have twenty years . Some of the boys have life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here , and it is our business to make Sing Sing just as useful a place for the men who are here as possible , and just as interesting a place as possible . Useful to the man who is going to leave . We have got to Leatr and develop him into a man . Interesting and useful ? at least , useful in serving those who are going to leave ? must be the life of the men who are going to stay here all the time . This is going to be a hard job , I know , but we have got to do it . There is no reason why we should just rot and rot and dry up and get worse and harder and more hitter . Let ' s make this place into a real college for the men , so that the boys who leave here will leavebetter and bigger men than when they came , and remember those they left behind with a good heart . ' And the others approved . This is no idle attitude of one man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college fortherernalsing of men . The boys in Portsmouth speak of it to-day as the University of I:ortsmouth . The most interesting result of this whole business is the fact that the prisoners themselves have become prison reformers , and become with a heart and a will , an idealism and emotional setting , which are characteristic of the true propagandist . This newer experience , to he made permanent in the life of the criminal , must carry with it certain elements which are not directly within the power of the prison community . These men have arrived , as a result of the socializing pressure of a prison democracy , at it newer outlook , and at a newer view of life . At least for the professional criminal , the democratic experience and its consequence are a spiritual awakening that is not to be denied . But the professional criminal , under present conditions , does not possess , generally , the means of continuing this experience when he has returned to the world Gem which he came . He may be a different man spiritually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has not materially changed . Suspicion of the man who has been in prison still exists , his possibilities for work and life away from crime are not basically different from what they were before he came to prispn . It is this fact which makes imperative the introduction of certain additional factors , which will tend to carry over to the world beyond the prison walls the experience and habits acquired in prison under democratic organization . The prison must actually become a self-governing , as well as a self-sustaining community in an economic sense . It must provide the means of learning a trade as well as that of earning sufficient money for self-maintenance and the care of dependents stranded in the world outside . This is not an impossible task . There is no visible reason why scientific organization of the working and economic aspect of the prison community should not be capable of carrying full support of the individual , as well as of the group beyond the prison dependent upon the inmate for an income . It would be the means of maintaining intact such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , to be fully successful , must be BO organized as to make possible the entrance of the criminal into an economic grouping in which he can function , and which will at the same time contain the possibilities of con. tinuing his newer democratic experience . This can apparently be done only by organizing the prison work in contact with , and under terms acceptable to , the labor unions , and thus providing for the entrance of the freed man into a labor group controlling his particular industry , and at the same time making possible the continuance of the method of democratic self-determination by participation in the problems and interests of the democratic labor organization .
