GIVEN the temperament , of course , one can be a good , thoroughgoing sloven at any age , and the only excuse for singling out a special decade to decry as idle is that its laziness has become general and conspicuous enough to arouse irritation , sympathy , admiration , or a tangle of all three feelings . The women of the thirties have done just that ; and , if I find temerity enough to generalize about them , it is not with any hope of pricking them out of their pleasant languor or crusading against their lack of full occupation , but rather to balance my own irritation against my admiration and see what comes of it . That they are annoying there can be no doubt , these women between thirty and forty and on the margins of the decade itself . They are younger than women of that age have ever been before , more confident of retaining their beauty , less burdened by housewifery , and better educated ; and surely they are offered a more highly spiced and savory world than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They live in what is called a speeding age and assert quite commonly that they are forced to speed with it , and yet never have there been young women who were more completely addicted to doing just what they please and in such quantity as pleases them . They are not of the generation which founded and built up the federated clubs , but in the natural order of things they might have been expected to receive the mantle of that organization and to show a becoming gratitude for the hand-me-down garment . Instead , the mantle may flap emptily in the wind until it blows to rags before the women of the thirties will wrap it around them . They do not like its cut or fashion . They are for the most part not the women who sought or gained the vote , but they have it without effort , and before an election , state , national , or local , every possible means must be thought of to coax them to the polls that they may register their lackadaisical choice . In the generation before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert household organization , but they found time , with a determination which lent itself so instantly to caricature , to march gravely out of their front doors to seek lighter moments of culture . They loved their lectures and their study clubs . But this generation of lazy thirties , courted and sought by every lecture bureau and professional lecturer in existence , wants none of that kind of edification . Causes sweep by them unheeded . I am not thinking of women of active talent , amateur or professional , nor of working women , nor of ill and invalid women , nor of those under the strain of poverty , nor even of those who make an arduous business out of social life . I am thinking of the rest . The really lazy ones are those of the middle class , under forty and yet definitely , if unwillingly , done with girlhood , whose babies have grown into school children , who are themselves good looking , healthy , and only normally harassed by financial problems . They are the young married women in the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , who are and will continue to be primarily  |p567  their husbands ' wives . They are variously called domestic , not domestic , overdressed , dowdy , a smoking , drinking lot , and a reactionary group ? which comparison means simply that they are a group made of smaller groups and that all these things are true of them . Their point in common is their inertia , their utter lack of response to the battle cries that used to get women into action . As a rule they are married , but if a stray virgin here and there finds that the cap fits her she may wear it . It is not hard to find witnesses enough for a reasonably hot prosecution . Ask any politician about the women to whom he turns for help and support in a swift campaign . His list , depending on what caliber of politics he plays , will be made up of older women who were prominent in the suffrage fight , of well-known club women , a few society women , a " key " woman here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , religious or national , and for the rest , political adventuresses . There will not be on his list , in all probability , the name of a woman who has graduated from college in the last fifteen years . There will not be on it a young woman from the local social register . There will not be on it any of those domestic and suburban young women who know their suburbs and their neighbors well . Not that the politician would not like to be in touch with such women , for he knows that their groups are reservoirs of voting power which are only lightly tapped and he would be glad to know a few women who have no political axes to grind or causes up their sleeves or prejudices in their pockets . But he will tell you shortly that the young women ca n't be reached , that they never do any work , and he is somewhat dubious of the fact that they vote at all . Maybe you can find them in the League of Women Voters , he may add , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that is politics and there is always a good reason for keeping out of politics . A woman can still plead a fine fastidiousness which , like a Bible quotation , is hard to controvert . It is a queer throwback to the swooning , fan-waving woman who has disappeared physically altogether , this attitude of many women toward partisan politics as being too rough and ill-smelling for their tastes . An attitude only , of course , for they conceal behind it a reluctance which has nothing to do with fastidiousness and which they are unwilling or unable to define accurately . But , accepting the excuse of delicacy and turning to relief and rehabilitation work , to what is spoken of in garbled fashion as welfare work , it is interesting , because it is so futile , to search for the young women of the lazy thirties among the hundreds of agencies , hospitals , orphanages , committees for the poor and outcast , all institutions which women promoted ardently in their beginnings . The thirties are not there . All these agencies have campaigns for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help and they nearly always need money . Is it young women who comb the city for funds , who act as administrators ? In ninety out of a hundred cases , it is not . It is sometimes their mothers , that older generation which is still enforcedly on the job . Or else it is a heterogeneous group of not too efficient workers loosely banded together by various impulses , honest altruism , social loneliness or ostracism , boredom . But the college-bred matron , the young woman of established position , the married Junior Leaguer , the wife of the young business man , is not there . Oh , now and then , of course . But a condition can not be refuted by an individual . When such a person is there she stands out because she is detached from her own group . Sit in at any board of any woman 's club and listen to the thirsty cry for new blood , for programs which will get the younger women interested . The clubs feel the presence of the younger women like a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The members of these boards , many of  | them pioneers in club work , are tired . So they look around them for their successors , for young women of normal blood pressure who can take up the work which has been so elaborately developed . Naturally , they instruct their nominating committees to get in new blood , and the committee searches patiently among the able young women of the town and is politely rebuffed ; and offices , supposedly niches of distinction , go begging . The best of the younger women do not want the offices and will not have them . They will not take up club work , and there is a cold firmness in their refusal which is based on no shyness . All sorts of rules and lures are tried , but when they say to me now in these directors ' meetings , in political committees , in relief work organizations , as they inevitably do say , " We must get the younger women interested in this , " I no longer enthusiastically agree and hope for a renaissance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having reached a degree of skepticism which gets no stimulation from debating the point . For I am sure that new boards of directors will be elected , new candidates run for office , new funds struggle for life , and the lazy thirties will remain quite undisturbed by efforts to get them into action . It is even worse than that . For when they occasionally do try such activity , as of course they do individually once in a while , they tire of it quickly . Now and then one of them is snared . For the moment she wants to do something and she takes an office , manages a campaign , works hard and very intelligently for six months , a year , even two years . But then , instead of having served an apprenticeship and being willing to go on farther , instead of wanting to go up in a club hierarchy or extend her executive or benevolent powers , she is through . The novelty has worn off , the impulse has run down , and under the novelty is none of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . To the young woman the responsibility is simply a deadly burden . And she shrugs it off and asks , " What 's it all about anyway ? " When I am among the lazy thirties I fear that question more than any other . Coming out of an indolence which I should be able to condemn , I find that it always staggers me . Since I am a renegade or apostate lazy thirty myself , I see the others of my decade intimately . We play bridge , we talk about clothes or children or books or somebody 's morals or a new shade of lupine or delphinium or a proposed dance club . Often the others profess to admire my own fervid activities . I know they lie . They would not be in my hustling boots at any price . But the lie is gracious and saves the faces of all of us . It is when they are frank and say , " What do you let yourself in for that sort of thing for ? " or more frankly , " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff you do gets anywhere ? " that I am afraid of controversy . I am not sure that I can hold up my end . For after a certain point , although they irritate me beyond measure , I have an irrepressible sympathy with their attitude . II Not with their pretensions . The thing that it is hardest to forgive the lazy thirties is that they never admit that they are lazy . They often admit that they are restless or bored , but their usual claim is that their days are full to the bursting point . They have husbands , children , friends , homes to look after , relatives who come to see them , vacations to go on and return from , clothes to buy , parties to give and attend . But what curious alchemy has affected woman 's job that the more that is taken away from it the larger it seems to her ? The principal excuse given by the young woman is motherhood and child care . Bringing many children into the world is out of fashion , but bringing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirties are crowded with  | mothers , super-conscientious ones who read a great deal about child life , the development of the very young child , the progress of the not so young child , the proper school , the proper discipline , the intelligence quotient , the social balance and so on . These mothers are wise as to clothing and diet . To a very large extent they look after their children 's welfare , and they have on the whole healthy and intelligent children who wear tasteful hygienic clothes . To be sure they have one , two or three children where their mothers multiplied such families by two and their grandmothers by four , but possibly they really have raised the intelligence quotient . It is too soon to be sure about that but we can give them the benefit of the doubt . The only point at issue is whether it needs quite so much time to pull it up , and so many classes and study groups to rear a normal child . For some of these women motherhood becomes a kind of sponge soaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose sight of everything but the Mother 's Day carnation ; and they often harass their children terribly by their anxieties , experiments , and solicitude . The mothers must start the children right , of course ; and if two or three children are born in quick succession it does mean possibly ten years of nursing and cream of wheat and carrots and caring for minor illnesses and reading aloud . Whether these things are personally done or merely supervised , they can become the most delightful and absorbing of tasks . A young woman told me recently that children really did take more time than they used to . " When you and I were children , " she said , " we could play outside freely , slide down hill , catch on teams , roller skate . But our children have to be supervised every minute in out-of-door play because of the constant peril of the automobile . And another reason why children take so much more time is because of the cost of domestic service . My mother paid two maids what I pay an incompetent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . But even granting that the early years of motherhood are entirely absorbing , the ten years pass , the pressure of child care inevitably relaxes , and if a woman has married at the average age , her thirties are still only half gone . Child care is an excuse , which , again like the Bible quotation , is hard to refute , except with the simple fact that children do grow and school laws exist . But the lady of the lazy thirties says that she not only has her children but her friends . Women have always had friends , to be sure , and formerly the friends were entertained much more lavishly than now , though possibly not so wisely . When guests came to stay in the last generation , they stayed for weeks instead of week-ends . The wellto-do woman now always has her club or her husband 's club to take the more arduous dinners and luncheons off her hands entirely and make a kind of guest hostess out of her . If she is not so well to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cooperate with her purse and her languor . Entertaining has not only been simplified , but it has been made less personal . I have a small collection of menus of dinners , favorite menus used by the mothers of some of those in the lazy thirties to-day . The dinners were always given at home , they ran through six or eight courses , and they were beautifully individual . The recipes and even the suggestions for table decoration are attached to the menus as each hostess had worked them out herself . To-day the average plan for a home dinner for a few guests is cocktails till ready , a quick dash from soup through to a confectioner 's sweet , and all the available liquor in sight . Nobody wants to eat very much nowadays , anyway . The point is that the young married woman of to-day is bearing fewer children , carrying less household responsibility , certainly doing less physical work such as sewing and cooking , entertaining more scantily , and certainly not proving  | that she is a better or more consistent wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the women of the past generation . Yet she can find no time for the things that the older women did have time for , for responsibilities outside her home . Days have not changed in length . There must be a catch somewhere . It is not time these women lack . That is simply the easy excuse for their inertia . They can clutter up their days with the machinery of their personal existence and the fuss of their small households and make a tremendous pother over some simple and natural psychological developments in their children and pretend they are over busy . But if the vast excitement and exhilaration and agony of wartime were to sweep over the country again , their excuses would quickly go glimmering . They would find time then for anything they wanted to do , and the more acute the need for their labor , the more time they would have . And the health and intelligence quotient of their children would not suffer . Or , if personally they should be caught in the economic wheels and have to earn their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to do it . The proof of that is in common anecdote . Everyone knows a case of what a woman with a family can do if she must . III They are lazy now simply because they are not interested in the vents offered them for activity , because they do not respect those things or admire them or even trust them . And that is the point at which I begin to be extremely sympathetic . Women in industry , in spite of certain rebuffs , are continually building up their jobs to suit the expanding knowledge and appetites and capabilities in themselves . But women who fall into what is technically the leisure class , that composite of so many domestic groups , are more likely to have to take what is given them ? or leave it . On the whole , they seem to prefer to leave it . They are offered the institutions built up for women of the leisure class by a group of their predecessors , who were very sober , very earnest , often exceedingly sentimental women . This generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste , not so earnest , and not in the least sentimental . The last generation wanted messages , rounded phrases , compliments on womanhood , inspiring discourse , and had simple faith in their own better natures because they were women , and not men . They were what Bernard Shaw calls " managing women . " This generation wants facts , physiological , psychological , or chemical , as the case may be , and is left utterly cold by messages or forward-looking discourses . They are amused by compliments and not completely respectful toward the rest of their sex . They are clear-eyed and clear-headed , and self-reliant because they must be so , having as a group lost reliance on a deity . They look on the activities which are offered and urged upon them and they are not tempted . The most notable example , of course , is the club work , which almost invariably fails to hold the lazy thirties , at least in any numbers . The fact is that the women 's clubs disappoint them . The programs seem to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous , the institution without humor . It is quite true that the average program of the average woman 's club is a pretty thin affair . Little speeches crowded into neat hours , beginning with greetings and ending with generalizations broad enough to cover land and sea , and ever , maddeningly ever , hopeful . Study classes with ill-assorted and heterogeneous minds jerking the discussion every which way . Committee meetings struggling not to hurt anyone 's feelings or interfere with any other committee . And then more speeches by professional lecturers who have been so warned not to offend and not to become  | too heavy and not to talk too long that their talks have become dull and often infantile . I heard recently a notable professor of psychology at a club meeting , though to do so I broke a vow that I would listen to no more lectures . His talk was worse than worthless . With a certain ineradicable charm , he spent an hour making jokes and not very good jokes at that , racing through a cheap talk good enough for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was wrong . Dozens of them besides myself were affronted at being given a lecture which he certainly would not have offered the freshmen in his university , and those same dozens were more than ever disappointed in a club which would allow itself to be the target for such a talk . That was one instance only , but it can be multiplied by seventy-five per cent of all the lectures I have ever heard at club meetings , many of them given by celebrities who have earned sufficient reputation to demand enormous fees . Most of them as talkers are not worth their railway fare . But it is a tradition in the woman 's club that the thing to do is to sit and be lectured to every now and then . So the lecturers get richer and the lazy thirties get lazier . For they will no longer endure the lectures . That is only one branch of club work , but it is illustrative of what keeps many young people out of them . The departmental club , brought to its zenith in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of thousands of women . It has brought the timid and the middleaged out of their homes , taught them the trick of organization , given them companionship , coached them in parliamentary law of a rudimentary sort . Those things may justify its vast machinery more than its actual impress on public opinion and action , although that too has been weighty . But it is none the less a fact that the departmental club , with its niches for drama , for literature , for art , for civics , does not strike the fancy of the rather sophisticated young matron of to-day . She wants stronger meat , sweeter , closer to the bone of life perhaps . She wants something more amusing and less academic . She finds these clubs thoroughly formed and rather set in their ways . The older women will gladly make a place for her if she will sit in it in their image and likeness . But this is exactly what she will not do . The small jealousies , the intrigues , the club politics exhaust her , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , are certainly growing much less petty . Club gossip is very smallminded , and the woman of the lazy thirties likes her gossip racy but not malignant . The quarrels in the clubs are minor and invariably over trifles , and while she enjoys a fight she does like to have something to fight about . The struggles over personal ambition are not interesting to her . She can find those in social life and play them for larger stakes . I know at least half a dozen women who founded and led the best and most vigorous clubs in their communities who can not get their married daughters to serve as committee members . The answer is , of course , that while the clubs want new blood they do not want new clubs , and the temper of the old club is not suited to the modern young woman . That is not a controversial statement but a rather dreary conviction . IV But , if she does not want to do club work she can go into politics . Here two avenues are open to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or into practical party politics . In the League she will find plenty to learn and she will be surrounded by exceedingly intelligent women with steady keen judgment who work together amazingly well . Here there is meat if she is looking for it , rather an exclusive meat diet , in fact , with very little political exercise to help her digest it . Often it does not agree with her . The League , if it is  | brilliantly launched in a community , and well sponsored , probably holds a larger per cent of the lazy thirties than any other organization . But it is none the less a small per cent , and the League knows well enough that its big fight ahead is to get enough of the thirties into the field to keep the pot boiling after the splendid pioneers who came to it from the battle for suffrage have gone . Perhaps they can do it . But the staunchness of that earlier group is not among the younger ones . They come but they go , too . They are not Goddriven as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffrage promoters were . They are stripped of purpose and only eager for stimulation . Sometimes they do seek the stimulation in practical politics , but that is apt to be a blind alley . The woman of the thirties might insist on being admitted into politics , not on the old theory that she was to clean them up , but on a new one , that she is to learn to steer and control . Being a moral scavenger is no longer popular among young women but they like human contacts , and politics is little more than a skillful arrangement of these . The difficulty is that the lady of the lazy thirties can not take much punishment , she does not stand up under political attack , abuse , and calumny . Again she lacks the resistance of her mother 's generation . There is left that ancient resource of women ? charity , and its modern child , social service . When passion and love grew pale women of all times have diverted their emotions into those channels , often with infinite grace . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to-day . There is surely a great deal of suffering still in the world , and as long as human beings remain human there will be a pleasure in its alleviation . But this skeptical and idle decade does not take its pleasure so . They may try , and be temporarily interested . But here , too , the effort is rarely sustained . They grow critical . They find too much sentimentality in one branch of relief work and too much machinery in another . And in any of these things they attempt they grow actually very tired after a little effort . Again , they lack staunchness and devotion to a purpose . Possibly their capabilities have shrunken from disuse , exactly as a stomach shrinks on a diet . So after their ventures they usually go back home , or perhaps they look at others venturing and do not stir from home at all . They are technically home women but have not the devotion of their mothers and grandmothers who so enjoyed offering themselves on the home altar . The lazy thirties consider a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to them a form of self-expression , even their child-bearing . They have come to the conclusion that is about all there is to living . I think sometimes that they are the most disillusioned group of women in the world , for disillusion has come to them so young , and in the midst of their happiness . As a rule they are reasonably chaste young women , whose love affairs of importance antedate their marriage . Aften ten years of marriage many of them have become even more handsome , with a kind of sterile beauty that has no mystery and little charm . They keep their figures . They play bridge and golf , adequately . Many of them read extensively and usually for stimulation and excitement , so that there come into their lives accounts of debauches , or perversions , crimes , and horrors . Such reading they are quite able to digest without disturbance . The important things in their lives are the financial and social hierarchies . These things are as tangible to them as clubs and causes are not . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so intelligent about the relationships between business and social life . It is not that they are coarse or climbing , for they are not . They are very amusing and amused about the way they move the pawns , and they know exactly what they are doing .  | Nothing excites them very much or disturbs them very much as they stir around in their small circles , except that they hate getting old . For getting old to them means no upgrade into dignity or wisdom or power . It means that they are slipping . Nothing else . V When I admire them , in spite of my irritation at their perverse laziness , it is because of that broad streak of disillusion which runs through the lot of them . It is nothing so obvious as cynicism , and they wear no sneer . They do not talk of being disillusioned . They do not consciously feel that they are . They are young wives and happy mothers and often beautiful women , and they assert that they are busy women . And yet , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without illusions , without any of the cushions of sentiment that women have been lying on so long . They lie on a hard bed and they know pretty well what is coming to them . They are enjoying their thirties deliberately , for they live in the shadow of the forties and the fifties , and to them the approaching decades are real shadows . They have built their lives on health and beauty and vitality , and those things dwindle as they go along . Youth without illusion has more resources than age without illusion , and that they are aware of , too . The pity is that the lazy thirties do become the discontented forties and the incapable fifties . If a woman , even a mother , does not build resources in the thirties , in the forties her children are in boarding school or high school , and she is restlessly seeking a part-time job or going faster and faster on her whirligig of personal enjoyment and enjoying it less and less . In the fifties she may be dependent on the beauty parlor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming one , is only four walls . That is what the older clubwomen found out and it drove them ? to build their clubs and listen to message after message . It was the imprisoning quality of those same four walls that made women brood over suffrage and get it , that made them go out and in hundreds of little ways try to improve the habits of the world . But they were women of great hope and faith and endurance , and the young women of to-day have little hope and consider faith sentimental . They can not be contented in the same way , and it is idle for the older women to try to berate or coax them into the old paths . One might as well suggest high shoes with laces . H anything can be done to give the thirties that rebirth of energy and interest that comes now only in times of calamity and crisis , to build up their energies before they fritter them away in half a woman 's job , it must be done by building on that streak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test . It is , I believe , the most substantial quality in them and possibly the modern form of honesty . If they are lazy , it is because they prefer to choose their own futilities instead of working out those of other people . If a matter is important , they must be shown that it is . And if the clubs want them and the politicians want them and the charities want them , they must present forms of expression suited to the temperament of the present thirties , and I fancy that these forms of expression must be presented without compliments or exhortation . Possibly the lazy thirties will never find a place in the departmental club , riddled with professional lecturers , honeycombed by intrigue . But the thirties need work . They need work to harden them up , to get them again on a normal diet of activities which will extend their energies . That is the chance for both politics and relief work . It has been my experience that in either of these fields a good , hard , definite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to it , and that she will not only do it , but visibly strengthen in  | doing it . I have seen one of them go into a battle over a county commissionership , develop the most remarkable political acumen , and do valuable work in securing better roads and greater honesty in spending county money . She respected herself for having been valuable . The trick now is either to find her more work or keep her interested to the point where she will find work for herself . I have seen fashionable young women , not suspected of being good mixers , come into campaigns for raising money and work side by side with all kinds of other women until they got the money . The young woman can work . But she is intelligent , and if she is going to waste time she prefers to waste it on herself instead of wasting it on some fraudulent impersonal object . It has to be a real piece of work before it can hold her . How all this energy can be saved I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough real jobs for women of leisure to go around . Possibly there is no way to sort out the jobs and the women they fit . The women themselves should help , but they may not . They should have a certain patience , should learn to take punishment , to be less quickly intolerant of machinery . But in any case , if they are not going to manufacture their energy and ability into a stock product like relief work or politics or a woman 's organization of any kind , that is all right , too , if only they will be honest about their laziness . For that is the bad flaw in their own clear judgment , the place where they trip themselves up , the reason why they are basically dissatisfied with themselves and grow melancholy in the forties . They will not admit their laziness , and yet it stays with them , a careless sloven ; whereas if they looked at it for what it is , decided to acknowledge it , brushed its hair , and smoothed its dress , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman of conscious leisure . I respect her thoroughly whether she is married or not , bears children or not . I envy her more than I do genius . She knows where she is going , or rather , she knows where she is staying . But though the lazy thirties have thrown off most of the silly shams which were passed on to them , they have yet to differentiate between laziness and leisure . That is why they are not yet in full control of their lives , why their attitude on the whole is a negative instead of an affirmative . For if the clubs are futile and the politics get nowhere , and if a disillusioned age has found that charity has a great many more attributes than are mentioned in the thirteenth chapter of Corinthians , if being a delightful person is the most a woman can do with her time , why not admit it frankly instead of camouflaging a pleasant and idle life with a pretence of vast activity , or hiding behind the children 's rompers or the responsibility of table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if they are of the temperament to enjoy it , let them have it . Hard work is good and necessary for some women , and there is still and will be for a long time plenty of interesting non-professional work for women to do , if they have the ability and temperament . But the air needs more clearing . No one should have to apologize for not flying into what is really voluntary work . No one should become absurd for going into it . But if one stays out it should be because one openly prefers leisure . Leisure and laziness have nothing in common . Laziness breeds discontent and cripples energies . Leisure breeds humor , of which we need much , and beauty , of which we need more , and philosophy , of which we need most . The thirties , if they are wise ? and on the whole they are both wise and clever ? will come to the point of choosing between the two . Destroy their laziness and preserve their leisure , and the thirties will be the incomparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
