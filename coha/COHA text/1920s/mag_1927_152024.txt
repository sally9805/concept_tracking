Should a man throw into the air a tennis ball , catch it as it falls , he would perform no great feat , arouse no great attention . But should he make , consecutively , 100,000 throws , 100,000 catches , he would become a famed person whom vaudeville patrons would lay down dimes , quarters , halves to see . For any action , no matter how trivial or inane , becomes a heroic achievement , if it is persisted in long enough to constitute some sort of record . <P> Thus , for example , one Alvin ( " Shipwreck " ) Kelly expects soon to collect $1,000 per week in vaudeville . No singer , no dancer , no card-trickster , no chatterer , no club-swinger is Mr. Kelly . He is a sitter . Last week he came down from a seat fastened to the top of the flagpole on the roof of the St. Francis Hotel , Newark , N. J. There he had perched continuously for twelve days and twelve hours ( TIME , June 20 ) . <P> During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazers at 25c per head . Others , equally curious but less solvent , jammed streets , stopped traffic , broke down fences , trampled lawns . Concessionaires opened hotdog , coffee , soft drink and peanut dispensaries . <P> One Lee Rapport , Polish , 22 , of New York City , challenged Mr. Kelly to a polar marathon , claimed that Mr. Kelly 's pretentions to the squatting championship were fraudulent in the extreme , inasmuch as he ( Mr. Rapport ) had once sat on a Parisian flagpole for 21 days . One Hugo Bihler , just-arrived German immigrant , who speaks no English , also challenged for the Sitting Sweepstakes , as did an unidentified Bostonian . Cried Mr. Kelly , belligerently , " Let those guys pick their poles and sit ! " But none sat . <P> Eventually , stiff , sore , weak from twelve days ' abstaining from solid food , Mr. Kelly came down . First he kissed his 19-year-old bride of six months , who had kept watch on the hotel roof , and hoisted up supplies on a pulley system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right hand in the pleasant task of signing the vaudeville contract promised as the fruit of his labors.
