Battery to ? Central Park , rested upon the Governor as he faced the audience in : the Academy of Music and proceeded to lay down a heavy fire on- the Republican record in New York State . . . Item by item and talking from " the record !

Not a Question of Party , " For , me this . is riot , so much a question of . party victory ; " he ? said . " I ? make ' - this plea : - earnestly and sincerely in a spirit . of . gratitude to the men arid women who , regardless of political affiliations , have - supported me and stood behind the ' policies I have advocated. , Having in mind the . best ; interests of . this State , I strongly urge the people not to 1 : - Lke a . backward step , but to go ? forward and to - maintain and progress the high standards which now prevail by electing- Franklin D. - Roosevelt - and the entire . Democratic ticket . " ? Nearly ' 4,000 persons in the hall rose and cheered the Governor as he made the plea . Outside a crowd estimated as high as 40,000 heard his voice through amplifiers and a roar of approval sounded even above the din in the auditorium. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . had - welcomed its favorite son home after his six weeks of national . campaigning . . The ? Governor ' did not begin his speech until ? 10:15 . P. M. , which was fifteen minutes later than had been scheduled . He did not ? end until 11:30 P.

Brooklyn gave him the night ? for good ' measure . The passage of his motor escort over , the Manhattan Bridge : was the-signal for the borough across the river to begin its acclaim . Streets from the bridge end to . the hall were . massed with cheering thousands , ' and in the vicinity of ' , the auditorium itself the crowd . was jammed almost , solidly . The , doors of the-hall were , opened for the meeting at , 5 o'clock and thirty-seven minutes later the doors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space inside the hall and even ticket-holders were turned away . When Fire Commissioner John J. Dorman opened the meeting he said ! that 40,000 persons-were outside and unable to get in . Before Governor Smith appeared on the stage ' the enthusiasm of the audience had been whipped to a high pitch by the candidates on . the Democratic State ticket . Commissioner-Dorman had yielded the gavel to Mrs. William H. Good , who presided as permanent chairman , - to ins lasscluce Mr. Roosevelt , Colonel Herbert H. Lehman , candidate for- the Lieutenant Governoship : Albert Conway , candidate for . Attorney General ; United States Senator Royal S. Copeland , Controller Morris S. Trerna.ine and Supreme Court Justice E. J. Byrne . Roosevelt Warmly Greeted . The ' reception accorded to Mr. Roosevelt rivaled ' that later given to the Governor : The candidate for the Governorship in his speech referred to the speech of Charles E.'Hughes in Brooklyn on Thursday night . He recalled that Mr. Hughes in the past had frequently testified to Governor Smith 's ability . He then noted Mr. Hughes 's condemnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by step the Republican Party in the campaign had descended " into the lowest depths of unspeakable slander , calumny and even obscenity . " " They have . condoned , " he charged , " every vile attempt to revive passions which have been dead in our nation since our ancestors burned witches in Salem . " Senator Copeland denied that the Republican . Party was responsible for prosperity and the crowd gave hearty agreement . Colonel Lehman outlined the ' issues of the State battle , and his running mate , Mr. Tremaine , spoke ? briefly . Mrs Conway predicted a Democratic plurality of 200,000 in Kings . The last speaker before Governor Smith was Justice Byrne and he kept his speech short so that the Governor could go on a nation-wide radio hook-up on time . Cheers outside the building and noise of violent blowing of horns sharply interrupted Justice Byrne 's speech and warned of the approach of Governor Smith . Immediately the whole hall went into an - uproar . Every one jumped up . - Flags were waved , torn bits of paper- fluttered down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band playing the " Sidewalks of New York . Gets Twenty-Minute Ovation . As the Governor made . his way through the crowd on the ' stage to the- front of the platform , the roar of ? applause swelled to echoing volume . The Governor stood at the front of the stage , smiling happily and stretching out his arm in greeting . The ovation continued . for twenty minutes , interrupted once as the crowd began to sing the " Sidewalks of New York . " They found they could not make enough noise with it , ? and again resumed their yelling . The band at ' last struck up " The - Battle Cry of Freedom " and " America " but after the singing the tumult was repeated . The Governor seated himself finally at the right of Mr. ' Roosevelt although the noise continued . Winning comparative silence , Mrs. Good introduced the Governor in a few ? Words as " the next President .

The crowd laughed and applauded as the candidate , in speaking of Mr. Ottinger , said the Gubernatorial candidate contented himself with simply saying something about " public rights remaining inviolate or some such high-toned expression as that . " There was noisy approbation in the audience when the Governor rejected the idea of long-term lease of water power sites , saying , " I would just as leave give it to them . " That was the theory , however , of the Republicans generally and of Herbert Hoover , he continued , making his first reference to , his Republican opponent . " Remember that the record is replete , " the Governor warned , " with testimony that he was acquiescing , to say the least , in the power lobby propaganda that was put through to discourage the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Issue . Governor Smith won repeated applause as he turned to the subject of farming , chiding the Republicans for their " old-time tricks " in professing " a wonderful devotion " for the farmer at election time . In the nation , he said , Senator Norris had spiked their promises ; but the State Republicans were beginning to claim all ' credit for helping the farmers . In 1922 , he said , the Republican State Administration ignored the question of paying indemnities for State slaughtered tubercular cattle and it remained for the . Democrats to insist upon the payments . Agricultural school appropriations and subsidies for county roads for the farmer had been generous under his Administration , he said . Rural schools and the cause of education generally had received vastly . increased attention and appropriations under the last Democratic Administrations , he continued . The audience applauded as he declared , " You can not get something for nothing , and if you want a high standard of education , you have got to pay for it . " " Here is one for you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he referred to ' a statement of Mr. Ottinger that he was in accord with the consolidation of State departments . The Republicans fought consolidation consistently , the Presidential candidate said , and if it had not been for his intervention they would have made H. Edmund Machold , the man who opposed consolidation , Chairman of the Reorganization . Commission , whose creation the Democrats at length forced . " You tell them now , Al , " an en the most satisfactory labor because of the warm greetings he had been given everywhere . " Take the chair from Albany to the White House , " some one shouted as the Governor referred to his desire to see Roosevelt become his successor . " I will not , " the Governor retorted . " I 'll cross Smith off it and write Roosevelt . " He warmly thanked nis runningmate , Senator Robinson , and then turned to " the State issues . " saying that he would relate them to national issues . " After all , " he said , " the proper and orderly administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handling of the business of the Federal Government . No man in the history of the State has had as great reason to be grateful to its people as I have had . They have honored me even beyond my own hopes . Actuated by a spirit of gratitude , I naturally feel a keen desire that the State continue to progress and that our people , from Buffalo to Montauk Point , continue to derive the full and complete benefit of a well-organized , responsive , intelligent and forward-looking government . " Tribute to State Ticket . The Governor praised in turn , Colonel Lehman , Mr. Conway , Mr. Tremaine , Roosevelt 's colleagues on the State ticket , and then called for the re-election of Senator Copeland . Taking up State Issues in detail , the Governor first discussed water power , declaring that he was preaching to the nation the same policy that he had urged in New York State . In State and nation , he said , the Democrats stood for preserving the hydroSMITH MAKES PLEA FOR STATE POLICIES // couraging shout was raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Approve Attack on OiliziparThe audience gave approval to the candidate 's attack on Mr. Ottinger for suggesting reorganization of the Labor Department . " That is just what we do not want , " he declared . " It has been organized , reorganized , and each time for political purposes and for political reasons . " He declared that Republican attacks last Winter on the Labor Department had been retracted when their authors were brought before a Moreland commissioner . The Republicans had branded as socialism , he continued , the proposals which were finally enacted into law for workmen 's compensation and . better care of the poor and sick . " When you come along with a modern , advanced , up-to-date , progressive method of handling something , Mr. Hughes will say you are putting the Government in business and Mr. Hoover will say ' State socialism , ' " he asserted . The Governor vigorously defended I his financial administration from what he called misrepresentation . ! While applause greeted his remark he said that Mr. Cttinger " has promised at least $100,000,000 worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have got to stop spending money . " Republican Federal officials , he continued , were assailing his financial administration and harping on national savings , he said , when in reality the Federal departments were costing $200,000,000 more now than they did in 1924 . Reverting to Mr. Ottinger , the Governor challenged what he said was fr . Ottinger ' s promise to remove the State income tax and defied him to tell where the State was to get the $32,000,000 which the tax produced . Unless education , public health or other necessary functions of the Government were eliminated the cost of the State Government could not be lowered , he said . The audience , comparatively silent through all of the Governor 's discussion of State issues , came to life with shouts and applause when he referred to prohibition . While the audience roared approval he referred again to Mr. Ottinger , saying , " He makes the interesting suggestion that he will wait until the commission appointed by Mr. Hoover reports on it . Well , that is a little bit too long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there ai n't going to be any commission . I 'll attend to that . As I have promised throughout the country I shall take that question to the American people and lay it before them fairly , clearly , straightforwardly and intelligently , and I shall let them settle it . " The Governor concluded with a discussion of the State parks , attacking Mr. Ottinger for telling Long Island people of his pride in the park program when " his party did everything they could to stop it . " " The nerve , the brass of a Republican to walk down on Long Island and talk about what their party is doing to give the people parks , " the . Governor vehemently declared . " Why , we got those parks down there in spite of them . We got them by battling for them . " A final ovation followed the Governor 's last defiance of attack on his State record . " I am going through a national campaign . I am fighting some Pretty bright men , " he said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . We are within two days of election . Have you heard from the lips of any mortal man a single suggestion about the government of this State under me ? He ca n't do it . "
