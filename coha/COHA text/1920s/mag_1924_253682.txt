Reporters and cameramen made a precipitant descent upon No. 6 E. 68th St. , Manhattan-the home of Frank L. Polk . There a Mr. Davis was spending the day . There he heard he was the Democratic nominee for President . <P> He soon found out what it meant to be a candidate . First , the deluge of the press . Then the deluge of supporters-the delegate from Porto Rico who had voted for Davis 33 times in San Francisco , and 103 times in Manhattan , etc . Soon the magnates of the party descended - Josephus Daniels , Pat Harrison , Governor Ritchie . Then the telegrams-from A. Mitchell Palmer , from ' Senator McKellar , from General Bliss , from Mr. Associate Justice Butler , etc. , etc . <P> Two of the telegrams are worth reproduction . One from a man incomparable among his kind , who was born a wit , made a politician , and elected a Vice President : <P> <P> IF GOOD WISHES HELP , YOU HAVE MINE . <P> THOMAS R. MARSHALL . <P> <P> The other was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND THE PARTY . I FEEL THAT IN YOUR HANDS THE THINGS THAT MR . WILSON FOUGHT FOR WILL HAVE A WORTHY CHAMPION . CONGRATULATIONS TO MRS . DAVIS . MRS . WOORDROW WILSON . Who is this Davis whom good wishes may or may not help , whom the widow picks to champion the things her husband fought for ? Who is he ? He is not one of the several Congressmen by that name , nor one of the several college Presidents , nor one of the several noted doctors including famed ophthalmologists , obstetricians , gynecologists , pathologists , nor one of the well-known clergymen ; nor is he General , Admiral , Judge , scientist , editor , theologian , curator , author . He is one of several lawyers and diplomats . He is , in fact , the John William who was born in Clarksburg , W. Va. , on April 13 , 1873 . That makes him 51 years old and just about eight months younger than Calvin Coolidge . It is generally reported that as a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accounts of this precocity will be amplified . At any rate he was graduated from Washington and Lee University at the age of 19 . Three years later he took his LL.B. at the same place . From 1915 on , he annexed a whole string of LL.D . ' here , in England , in Scotland . <P> John William was now a lawyer . First he practiced with his father , J. J. Davis , who had been a member of Congress . Then he returned to Washington and Lee as an instructor and later went back to his father 's office . Then he served a term in the State Assembly . His father advised him not to go there a second time ; so he stuck to the law until 1910 . <P> In that year , John William attended the State Convention . It was decided to nominate him for Congress . John William agreed to accept , provided only that his father , then retired from the political arena , would not object . A telegram was dispatched to the elder Davis . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John William not to take the nomination . Both were pocketed by a wily politician , one Ignatius Brennan . John William was nominated by acclamation and accepted . Some time later he received his father 's messages .
