Before taking post at the Court of St. James 's General Charles Gates Dawes last week appeared in Washington to confer with the Secretary of State . Also , the following occurred : <P> Reporter : " Mr. Ambassador , are you taking any of those silk court knickers with you to London ? " <P> Ambassador Dawes : " Do you want a diplomatic answer or the answer that deserves ? " <P> Reporter : " Shoot ! " Ambassador Dawes : " Then you go plumb to hell-that 's my business . " <P> News cameramen pushed around for pictures . <P> Ambassador Dawes : " I 'd better take this pipe out of my mouth , I 'm a diplomat now pause ; no , by gosh , I wo n't . " <P> Eyeing his brief case in the path of the cameras he tossed it aside and said : " I want to get this badge of bureaucracy hidden where it wo n't show . " <P> At the Senate Ambassador Dawes held a reception , spied New Jersey 's Senator Edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Ambassador to France . <P> Ambassador Dawes : " Hello , Walter , I hear you are going to Paris . " <P> Senator Edge , already the diplomat : " Charlie , the fact that you will be just across the Channel in London almost persuades me to apply for the Paris job . " <P> Ambassador Dawes : " Why , I thought that was all settled . I only decided to go to London when I heard that you would be in Paris . " <P> Of his successor , Vice President Curtis , Ambassador Dawes remarked : " Charlie sure is a splendid presiding officer . " <P> Then the Ambassador asked many a Senatorial friend to lunch with him in the Capitol and , jokester that he is , left the bill to be paid by Senate Leader Watson of Indiana . <P> Pending definite news , Senator Edge was internally atwitter over the prospect of being " just across the Channel , Charlie . " A somewhat rotund , full-blooded gentleman of 54 , with a history-printer 's devil to **29;10254;TOOLONG reminiscent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , he might feel , if he got the post , that he had earned it . He has worked up the Republican ladder diligently , from clerk in the New Jersey State Senate , to Governor , to the U. S. Senate . His earnestness and lack of poise while speech-making make him accompany his words with an up-and-down motion of the elbows which has brought him , among newsmen , the title of " The Jersey Buzzard , " which he bears cheerfully . Lately his earnestness is reported to have taken the form of deep religious feeling . <P> As an Ambassador , especially to France , he would be most fortunate in his wife . His first wife , Lady Lee Phillips of Memphis , died in 1915 . Six years ago , aged 48 , he married Miss Camilla Loyall Ashe Sewall , some 20 years his junior , beauteous daughter of a rich and celebrated ship-building family of Bath , Me . She has borne him four children ( the fourth arrived last month TIME , May 6 ) . There are few things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wealth .
