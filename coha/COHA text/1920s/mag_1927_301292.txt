Prophets <P> We stand <P> For the glad hand . <P> That 's the spirit of our crew . <P> Grotto <P> Has a motto , <P> We will see our good pals through . <P> You 'll find <P> We 're the right kind , <P> Mystic Prophets tried and true . <P> Pride swells , <P> Fellowship tells , <P> What the Grotto means to you . <P> When Masons with dignity or a sense of humor heard the above , official " Grand Monarch March " of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm , bellowed through the streets of Cleveland last week by a throng of hilarious grocers , salesmen , lawyers , druggists , dentists , they groaned helplessly . <P> The worst of it was that the Mystic Order , etc. , is quite as Masonic an organization as any other. * Only Masons may join it . True , it is not an official order . It was organized 38 years ago by some hearty Masonic playboys of Hamilton , N. Y. , as " a relaxation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members come only from the Blue Lodge ( first three degrees ) of Masons and unlike the " Shrine " ( sidelong organization of high-degree Masons ) the lowly " Grotto , " as the Mystic Order is called , has no serious purpose. + <P> Yet the Grotto 's frolicsome purpose is taken very seriously by some Prophets . George Jerome Brenner , handsome stock- &-bond; man of Saginaw , Mich. , who was last week elected Grand Monarch , speaks with solemnity of the Grotto 's duty to " spread the doctrine of smiles . " Mystical , he thinks that " making men happy makes men in every walk of life better . " The outgoing Grand Monarch , Judge Frederick P. Walther of Cleveland , said : " We are seriously engaged in the serious business of trying to make men happy . . . justified our existence . . . world better because we have lived . " <P> The Grotto technique of smile-spreading is to select a large city annually , have it hung with bunting ( mostly Persian orange and light blue ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid summer week herd thousands of Prophets from all , over the U. S. and Canada to the city and tell them to " have fun . " Since 1889 , " joiners " to the number of 160,000 have become Prophets . Providing them with fun has become a portentous task . <P> But the Prophets regard high-degree Masons as " too serious . " Last week in Cleveland , some 20,000 Prophets-and perhaps 2,000 " Daughters of Mokanna " ( wives of the Prophets , members of local " Caldrons " ) in " semiformal sport wear " - had fun . The pseudo-Islamic nomenclature of their various Grottoes was a cause for mirth in itself - the Al Sirats of Cleveland , host Grotto ; the Ganjas of Chattanooga , Tenn. ; the Azabs of Fall River , Mass. ; the Murgas of Galesburg , Ill. ; the Azizes of New Britain , Conn. ; the Kadjars of Marion , Ohio , where President Harding , Elk and Mason , lived . <P> Other Grottoes are called Ali Baba , Kamram , Islam , Zemzem , Omar , Gul Reazee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindoo Koosh-meaningless , perhaps , but a vast relief from real names like Smith , Jones , Dunkle , Schmaltz , Babbitt.
