When the cream and chocolate Golden Arrow Express glided out of Paris , one noontime last week , a certain smooth-shaven , starched-collared , quietly dressed U. S. passenger passed unnoticed among many another en route to London . As he worked rapidly through a neat sheaf of papers , the traveler looked much like other graduates of Rutgers , other Baptists , other natives of Bloomfield , N. J. His choice of viands at luncheon was to eschew a la carte dishes and accept the table d'hote offered . Fellow passengers continued unconscious that they were actually traveling on the same train with the Agent General of Reparations , Seymour Parker Gilbert , famed fiscal tidier-up of Europe . <P> Respectful Englishmen welcomed the Agent General at Dover and arranged his discreet conveyance to a small estate in Kentshire . The host , who personally flung wide a welcoming door , is the fiscal arbiter of Britain , rubicund Winston Spencer Churchill , affable but shrewd Chancellor of the Exchequer . Very soon it appeared that Host Churchill was not excessively anxious to discuss and come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert to come over via Paris from Berlin . The Agent General 's visit meant that Germany purposes to hold France and Britain to the promise recently given by their representatives at Geneva : namely that an International Finance Commission shall be set up with all appropriate speed , to readjust the whole structure of Reparations Payments ( TIME . Sept. 24 ) . However , Chancellor Churchill has long been known to favor at least temporary retention of the Reparations status quo . Therefore it was not surprising that Host Churchill kept Guest Gilbert out in the open a great deal-displaying to him the Churchill estate , rather than settling down before the hearth to wrestle with millions , billions . <P> Prominent among rustic oddities displayed was a small , red brick cottage just completed by the Chancellor , who has personally laid each brick . All through the summer he has troweled vigorously , whenever he could snatch the time , assisted by his hodcarrying daughters , Sarah , Diana . By thus bricklaying , smart " Winnie " Churchill has achieved two objectives . His embonpoint is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has reaped much vote-getting publicity among the myriads of laboring Britons who have seen him troweling and slathering mortar in the " picture papers . " Since the whimsical Chancellor has actually carried his stunt to the extreme of joining a bricklayers ' union , he was able to display to Agent Gilbert a union card : <P> <P> Winston S. Churchill <P> ( Occupation , Bricklayer ) <P> Westerham Kent <P> <P> As if all this were not sufficiently distracting from Reparations , the Agent General was beamingly conducted through the Chancellor 's Piggery ( TIME . Oct. 22 ) . where fat , nuzzling porkers are stuffed with choicest swill for prize winning purposes . From a source close to Mr. Gilbert it was reported that the grave problems in hand were not seriously attacked until he and Chancellor Churchill went up to London for a formal conference with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin .
