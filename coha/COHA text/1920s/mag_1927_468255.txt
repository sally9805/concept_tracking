I SELDOM sit down to an American meal without remembering pleasurably the scriptural verse : " He asked water and she gave him milk ; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish , " and when I am not otherwise engaged I frequently wonder why it is that Americans who are not sparing of their criticisms of things Continental never --  or never as far as I know ? grumble at the parsimony of European restaurateurs in the matter of that comestible . For myself the continually refilled miniature saucer of firm , fresh butter that is always beside my plate on the American table is a constant source of pleasure . And to all appearances it is supplied gratis , though whether it be or no I have no means of knowing since I have never looked at a bill in this country . I do n't look at bills ? not because I am extravagant , or British , or plutocratic . In France or England I not infrequently examine a waiter 's reckoning with some attention . In France you are not respected if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the English waiter respects me or not , so having learned the habit in Paris , I do not bother to discontinue it in London . But then in London and Paris I know the language . I do n't mean to say that in New York or Chicago I should not understand the wounding things that a detected waiter might say to me ? the point is that I should not know how to sass him back , whereas in either of the other metropolitan cities I enjoy making a scene in dishonest restaurants . I remember one . . . That has nothing to do with American cooking but it has this American association forme in that we were taken for Americans ? and South Americans at that ? and treated as such . That is to say that we were ? or rather my friend was ? charged eighteen pounds odd , or say ninety dollars for four indifferent dinners such as arc served at monstrous and expensive caravansaries the world over , for three bottles of wine two of which were corked , and some liqueurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do not mean to write of those large and despicable places which are all the same the world over . Their procedures are identical , find yourself in which hemisphere you may . They hire a famous chef . He has as a rule one special dish which he rides to death in the menu and only carefully prepares for the very rare customer who is well known to be captious . He has too many underlings to be able to superintend them properly and as a rule he lets them do as they will after a lesson or so . His hot plates -- or whatever means he adopts of keeping dishes warm ? keep dishes warm until they are tasteless , tepid , and entirely tedious . It is indeed the tediousness of meals in these places that is their chief characteristic even if the chef has distinguished himself over his special plat . For what is the good of eating canvasback duck a la New Orleans , or canard Rouennais , or wild duckling with marrowfats and orange-peel sauce , be they never so delicious , if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is deep boredom . I would rather have a little bully beef , a raw onion , some good strong cheese , a leaf or so of cos lettuce and salt , some good crusty bread and plenty of fresh butter ? and of course a bottle of hard old ale . I aver that I have had better appetite for such a meal ? and better talk over it ? than I have ever had for the most excruciatingly French-misnamed cookery in any of the Ritzes or Carltons or Splendides in any city of any continent . Of course their champagnes will stimulate the tongue , but personally I hate both champagne and the conversation it induces . Claret is the only wine over which to converse ; Cluiteau Neuf du Pape is good if you are tired and wish to soliloquize or talk heated politics ; burgundy is good to make love upon ? hut champagne is good only for the fag-end of dances , and in the form of cocktails for young ladies at that . But what is this ? . . . I am writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nodded . Here I drink ginger-ale with my meals , the water tasting nightmareishly of chlorine . But how else is one to write of cooking ? The purpose of meals is companionship , reminiscence , and communion , otherwise they are mere stoking . And immensely much of the pleasure of consuming choice meats is geographical . How often when , at a really good board , you are dwelling on chicken with all its fixings will you not observe a dreamy look steal over the face of your dinner partner ! Then you know that she is thinking of Maryland with its steamy fields at dusk when the chickens come to hand and the grasses are fragrant . Or how often have we not dreamed of the Common and the Back Bay , or of Lexington , or Concord or the Adirondacks when we consumed cassoulet de Castelnaudary , which in its more commercial forms of the Paris restaurants is nothing but baked beans and pork ? . . Of course when you consume cassoulet de Castelnaudary in Castelnaudary I do not know what geographically you think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know I have done so . We had on that occasion between us two bottles of the most priceless 1906 Ch ? But I Imow Imust not . The cassoulet came off a fire that has never been extinguished since 1367 and that has always had a cassoulet on it . . . . And the sunlight beating down on the white road sent hot rays up through the jalousies and the commercial travelers cleaned their knives on the tablecloths and like the morning stars sang in their glory . Do you know what you sing on such occasions ? It is But I know I must not . The curious thing is that I can not remember what I ate long , long ago in Baltimore or elsewhere in Maryland ? except for watermelon which comes back to me as resembling a bath sponge that has sopped up some very weak sugared water . We used to cut chunks out of it with the machetes with which we cut the corn , and then we would return to cutting the corn beneath a vertical sun in the copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet on a barrel at the store at crossroads , waiting with the rest of the inhabitants for the mail and consuming dried apple-rings from another barrel . And I used to wonder what could have been the cause of the subsequent nightmare . I remember , too , bringing numerous packages back from the store in the buckboard I was given to drive . I remember how the buckboard was tied together with bits of string and the harness with decayed rope . I still see the agile chestnut horses ; I still feel the jolting over the roads which in England we should have called sand dunes and ravines because of the rocks ; I remember the sun which in England we should have called a blast-furnace and the dust and the catydids . . . . But as for what was in those packages from which we presumably ate . . . nary bite ! But stay . There comes back to me succotash in little saucers which did not interest me . But corn grilled , or rather toasted on the cob ! Ah , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen of the colonial farmhouse where we ate . And , by a process of reasoning rather than by recollection of taste , I remember fried eggs and chicken on Sundays . I say process of reasoning because I remember the farmer saying that he dare not kill one of his own beasts or hogs because they were all marked down by the meat trust . You could not , he said , buy fresh meat between Baltimore or Philadelphia and San Francisco . Perhaps he was exaggerating . At any rate I do not remember much of the rural food of Maryland or Pennsylvania in those days ; but I do remember pleasurably certain foods in New England and New York . I never , I think , ate baked beans actually in Boston , but I do remember eating admirable beans in Fall River , Massachusetts , in a little frame-house , the property of a trolley conductor . He had begun by asking if I were English and then had said that his wife was English . I talked queer but not so queer as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there , sure enough , was his wife and , sure enough , she did talk queer , for she was a Lancashire cotton-operative lassie speaking a dialect so broad that it was all I could do to understand her . So we cowered us down in i ' th'ingle and had a gradely pow , while the beans were baking in the bean pot , which was as delicately browned as any meerschaum . She was a high-colored , buxom creature . I do n't remember whether she had come to Fall River of her own accord to make her fortune in the cotton mills or whether the trolley conductor had visited Manchester and married her because she was a skilled cotton-operative . But she wore a shawl over her head for all the world as she might have done in An-coats market , and in spite of it her beans were admirable --  -- as good as the comoulet of Parisian restaurants . I have certainly latterly never tasted anything so good . But that is perhaps prejudice . You see , the other day , somewhere north of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was to the effect that , alas and alas , local comestibles no longer come from the designated localities . Boston beans come , the pork from Chicago , the beans from , say , Milwaukee ; and they are all canned somewhere in the Middle West . And so with all food in America : it came , he said , out of tins ? even canvasback duck , Russian caviare , and soft-shelled crabs . That writer indeed averred that there were only two clubs in New York where you could be certain of eating genuine canvasback and you had to order it beforehand at that . He perhaps exaggerates ! How that may be I do not know . Standardization must have its victories that are more cruel than those of war . It is true that during the late War we had frequently to eat baked beans and mutton out of cans . I remember a first-class carriage on a siding outside Hazebrouck at one o'clock in the morning with the thermometer below zero and no windows in the carriage ; and my batman heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and our sharing it . And damned good it was . But to eat it in an apartment house in peace time , with no chance of even such exercise as running from shells would be pretty cruel . Standardization II and de-territorialization go on the world over . Last summer in Avignon in the south of France under the shadow of the Palace of the Popes , in a restaurant that I had found admirable for thirty years ? I had , indeed , years ago eaten there in the company of Frederic Mistral , the Proven ? al poet ? there , in that sacred and august shadow I was offered Norwegian anchovies with the hors d'oeuvres and peche Melba made with California peaches out of a tin . The Mediterranean that swarms with real anchovies was only fifty miles away , and Norway is seven hundred or so ? and Heaven alone knows how far it is from California to Avignon , whilst in the spring whole hillsides of Provence are nacreous-pink with peach blossoms . But the peaches go to London ; and Norwegians and Californians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come to New York to eat Mediterranean anchovies . It is perhaps not a mad world , but it seems a pretty queer one sometimes . The gentlemen who write to the newspapers about the deterioration of their national cookings may perhaps be regarded with suspicion . They are apt to cry 0 tern 0 mores ! because it is agreeable so to cry and , being usually oldish , their palates have frequently deteriorated . I daresay my own may have . And I usually avoid newspaper comments on food . I never can understand what sort of person writes them . Nevertheless , they are sometimes amusing . I have lately been reading a controversy between a writer in an anti-American English paper and another in a pro-German and , therefore , anti-English review published in New York . Says the one , " It is impossible to find anything decent to eat in New York " ; and the other , " It is impossible to eat any London food . " Cries the Briton , What price the shoulder of mutton at A 's ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quince and apple tart at C 's ; the beef a to mode at D 's ; the Welsh rarebit at E 's ; the entrees at F 's ; the dessert at G 's ? . . . all in London . Retorts the American , What about the Sauerkraut at H 's , the Kaiserschinorren at I 's ; the Limburger mit Pumpernickel at L 's ; the gedaempfte Gaenserbrust at M 's ? .. . all in New York . And so the contest rages . Let us try to ascend into regions more serene . Think of oysters . . . . There are few things that I have so frequently discussed with Middle-Westerners on the boulevards not of Chicago , Ill. , but of Paris , France . There are few things over which excited patriotisms are more hideously stirred . You may more safely blaspheme against the Tricolor , the Union Jack , or Old Glory than breathe a word against the blue point , the Whitstable native , or the Marenne . And on the boulevards where the battle of the oyster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them I am frequently alarmed for fear knives should finish up these contentions . The Americans allege that American oysters alone are divinities amongst bivalves ; they allege that all European oysters taste strongly of copper . The Europeans have naturally never tasted American oysters , but the idea that anything can be said against their sacred and nacreous sea-food with the traditions that go back to Caligula ? that sets them foaming at the mouth . The subject last year so intrigued me that I one day determined to give the matter an exhaustive test . The idea occurred to me in Paris , in mid-September , and from that day to this I have consumed oysters daily and at almost every meal . In New England I have even had them for breakfast . This you will not believe , but I have . And well , I have eaten them in Paris , in New York , in Boston ; and ? though I was warned against it ? in Chicago . I even wished to eat them in St. Louis , but I was there taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hate soup . So imagining myself fairly qualified and being sure of my impartiality , I venture to give this verdict . It is incorrect to say that the European oyster tastes of copper . Indeed , how can the American gastronome know how copper tastes , whereas have not every Briton and every French child sucked coppers in their cradles ? He ought not to do it but he does , so that few savors can be more familiar to him than that of the humble ha'penny . At any rate , it is familiar to me and I solemnly aver that what the European oyster tastes of is the sea ? and that is why we love it . Whilst we devour it we see frigate-warfare in which the victories are won by Nelson or Villeneuve according as we were born on one side of the blanket or the other ; we see the limitless verges of eternal ocean ; the blue of Capriote grottoes gleams translucently before our reminiscent eyes . And as / have already said , one of the chief values of food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clam does taste of copper and , except in the form of clambake eaten on an open beach , I personally dislike it very much . But the Blue Point and the other American oysters are different . They are completely flavorless and they rely for their attraction on texture . For their flavor they have to fall back on such adjuncts as tomato catsup , horseradish sauce , and other excitants of the palate . They are , in short , different . No doubt if you have seen them in their beds or if you have consumed them on the shores of Nantucket they will make you see the ocean by means of their texture ; but for me the only thing that happens when I eat a Blue Point is that I see the face of the nice person with whom I was eating when I first self-consciously and with attention placed one of those morsels , duly dripping with cocktail sauce , between my lips . . . . That is good enough ; je ne demande pas mieux . And by a curious coincidence , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat oysters in St. Louis . The singular flavorlessness of the American oyster impressed me so much that at first in my haste I averred that you might just as well take one of the little round crackers , butter it well , and soak it in cocktail sauce . But that is not true . I remember , by the bye , twenty-one years ago at Mouquin'salas , there is no longer any Mouquin'sasking Miss Cather , whose name I permit myself the pleasure of mentioning , why she took horseradish sauce with her oysters . She replied , " Well , you see they have sometimes rather a funny flavor . " But that was twenty-one years ago , and refrigeration has abolished that characteristic . Still it is nottrue that buttered cracker will really replace the Blue Point . I eat them frequently just for the flavor of the cocktail sauce but I do n't then see any pleasant visions . No , the real merit of the Blue Point as of the Cape Cod and their even vaster compatriots is their texture . If you could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could give their American relatives the European flavor then indeed you would have called the New World in to redress the balance of the Old . You can indeed convey their jolly plumpness to the Whitstable native and doubtless to the Marenne . I once kept a number of English deep-sea oysters in a shallow tub of frequently renewed sea-water , feeding them on very fine oatmeal the while , for about a fortnight . At the end of that time they were as plump as butter . . .. But they had completely lost all flavor ! And they had not the pleasant ? let me call it resilience , of the Westerner . And of course , with its great varieties of size , the American oyster can give points and a. heating in the matter of emotion . Its gamut is extraordinary . The Marenne or the Whitstable native ? or even the humble Portuguese oyster which resembles a teaspoonful of seawater to which has been added a little gummy mud ? all these you must eat in a. sort of reverie so that your tongue may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , really be eaten in solitude . But over the American oyster you can converse freely , you can be gay , I daresay the young could even make love , as they can over burgundy . Madame la Duehesse de Clermont-Tonnere in her admirable book on les bonnes chases de la France states that the favorite ? the almost sole comestible consumed in the cabinets partieuliers of that pleasant land is the crayfish , the drink being Pommard , so that it is on the scarlet shells of those crustaceans rather than upon the nacreous blue-gray ones that you tread when mounting the stairs . How that may be I do not know but the duchess ' assertion goes to prove my contention that the European oyster is an attendant upon reverie . But it seems to me that you can do anything over any American sea food . I daresay you could even cry over a Cotuit , and as for me , when called upon to consume one of those things as large as soup plates that now and then come in one 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real he-man , devouring young babies , having in each hand a half-gnawed shinbone with which I bash on the head my fellow guests to right and left . HI I am now going to make a terrible confession : I find American food in practically all public places to be huge in size , splendid in appearance , but almost invariably as nearly flavorless as possible . That is not really an indictment of American cookery , but merely of the material employed and , if it is an indictment at all , it is meant to attach only to meals served in public places . For I want to make as strong a point as I can of the following statement , sine it is the Great Truth about cooking . If I could I would print the whole in capitals so as the more firmly to rivet it on your attention . I am amazed when I hear Americans complain with heat and even as if with hatred that you can not get decent food in England . These individuals I always ask at once , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an English upper or upper middle-class home ? Or have you ever even eaten in a first-class English club ? " Of course they never have . You could exactly reverse the questions and the answers . And that is the Great Truth . In wealthy ? and still more in wealthyish ? American homes the cooking is as admirable as it could be anywhere . I remember an American dinner which was cooked in Paris by a French woman whom the American family in question had taken with them to spend two yearsin this country . She had been an authentic cordon bleu to start with and she had picked up her American cooking from negresses in , I think , Kentucky . At any rate it was in the South . And this combination resulting in this particular dinner was as good as anything I have ever eaten . It was as good as anything could possibly be . That was American cooking . But if you reproduced the same sort of circumstances for English cooking ? I mean that if you took a French cook and installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would let her assimilate the knowledge of English " good plain " or " professed " cooks , the dishes she would cook on returning to Paris would be just as admirable . They might , indeed , be better . Except for the wine ? since you can not get good wine in England !  - -  they might really be better if she remained in London where materials are better than they are in Paris ? at any rate in the department of meat and fish . That would be English cooking . For there is no sense in talking of any national cooking except in terms of meals produced by really skilled professional practitioners in moderately wealthy homes , the meals to be composed of first-rate materials . For it is to be remembered that cooking begins before the kitchen is reached , the selection of foods being almost as important as their preparation or their heating and dishing up . I can not , of course , claim to have any very intimate knowledge of the materials that are at the disposal of the American professed family cook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets and to examine the meats , fish , and fruits displayed . They all seem to me to suffer from standardization , and certainly they all do seem to suffer from cold storage or refrigeration . But that very good material can be obtained in this country I know because of innumerable meals that I have eaten in kindly and hospitable families . American public meals are horriblebut so are English public meals and so , for the matter of that , are French , German , Italian , and Spanish AngloSaxonized ones . For , in the matter at ! east of cookery , the world suffers from over-communication and too efficient transport . I daresay that in California even Californian apples , oranges , or figs may have some flavor . They certainly have not in London . New York , Boston , Avignon , or Strasbourg . That may , of course , be due to transport , but I happen to have paid some slight ? of course mainly epistolary ? attention to the matter of fig-culture in the Far West , and I believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the most delicious of small Italian brown figs becoming almost as entirely tasteless and fibrous as the native Californian fruit within a year or so after transplantation . But it is not merely the transporting of food materials from one end of the world to the other that is responsible for the dead ino-. notony , inedibility , and indigestibleness of all western European and farther Occidental public cooking . I sometimes think that , long before the invention of wireless telegraphy , restaurateurs and restaurant cooks must have developed some thirteenth or fourteenth sense by which from the Prado to the Lido and from the Strand to the banks of the Nile and back again to the shores of Lake Michigan they have telepathically communicated their terrible secrets of the preparation of tepid underdone beef , sauces compounded in imitation of bill-stickers ' paste , Cede de veaux Clamart , chicken cutlets , and the even more unnameable vegetable horrors that you are called upon to eat amongst marble and gilding , with spiky palm leaves threatening to tickle the back of your neck , to the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I am concerned , the best public meals I have eaten I ate lately in Chicago ? but even they were nothing to write home about . These things run in strata . Below these gilded atrocities are to be found the Cimmerian box-shaped caves where eat the poorer white-collared classes ? the clerks and stenographers who are the ball-bearings of our civilization . Here you may reach the lowest depths of despondency over imitation-marble table tops . I say despondency because whether in London , in New York , in Birmingham , Manchester , or any other American or British provincial city to eat regularly in these places you must not only feed without interest but you must have arrived at a state of being without hope , and so your digestion will color your mentality with the gloomier shades of despair . The curve goes upward in the strata socially below this . I have eaten in what we call " good pull-ups for carmen , " cabmen 's shelters , and the like in I do n't know how many European cities , and in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them come across food that was not admirable in quality , if usually a thought tough , roughly served , of course , but always piping hot and well-flavored . That is because that class of human beings ? the men who drive horses in wagons , or motor lorries , who haul heavy burdens about the world and up to sixth or fourteenth floors ? goes to make up the one Occidental city class which takes a keen interest in its food . It needs good keenly flavored viands to crush between its powerful teeth and it sees that it gets them . Its subsequent labors take care of its digestion . IV It sees that it gets them . . . . The whole moral of the world of food considered as a delight lies in those words . Except by accident or when making purposed excursions for the purpose of this writing , I have lived as well , I have found as good food and as well cooked , in New York as I habitually do in Paris . That is because if I may express a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I get it . It takes some trouble , it means exploring nooks and corners , mostly in the basements of obscure streets . But it can be done . It might be done by everybody . It might be done and Anglo-Saxondom should do it , as they used to say of the Northwest Passage . I have spent some time lately in examining with attention the weekly menus afforded presumably for non-wealthy households by the cookery experts of Sunday papers of many cities in this continent , and all I can say is that when reading them I have felt precisely the same profound dejection which has been mine when perusing similar diet sheets in Great Britain . And I know something about it . For a long period of time I prepared the weekly diet sheets for large units of His Britannic Majesty 's expeditionary force . Nay , I even waged an eternal war in the course of which I was frequently disciplinarily but not morally bruised ? a war with the Commander in Chief of the culinary branch of the service . In private life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the director of one of those immense concerns that spread indigestion , ennui , and despondency through sixty per cent of the thirteen million population of the capital of our empire . He would produce for my guidance diet sheets that might have been compiled by Isabel of the New York Sunday Eagle or Dora of the Liverpool Weekly Herald . There was the same superfluity of what I believe is called in this country " roughage " and the same complete want of anything with any taste to it . I for my part completely ignored his orders ; I gave my men as many savory , small portions as the food at my disposal and the industry of my cooks could command . I tried to contrive that frying was done with animal and , if possible , with pork fat ; I nibbled coppers away from money allotted to the awful things called in this country cereals and spent it on condiments . In France I even bartered small quantities of , say , hominy-ration for garlic . All hell broke loose overmy battalions ; the G. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls at my head . But my men were contented , alert , cheerful , good at drills , admirable marksmen , and perfect demons with the bayonet . . And I was not shot . The dreadful topic of " roughage " needs a whole volume to itself . I must limit myself here to the briefest moral summing up . Happiness , contentment , alertness , clear eyes , bright crisp hair ? and even , who knows ? consummate salesmanship ! ? can come only from eating many small portions of food that you really like and that is so savory that your mouth waters in anticipation . It is by the water of your mouth that your eyes will be made to shine . You must eat , when you eat in restaurants , in tiny places ? they can be found in New York ? where there are no gilding , palms , or music . The money that might have been spent on those will there be put into the viands and the wages of the cook . You must talk frequently to the proprietor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife or your fellow guest . And above all you must eat what you like and only what you like . You must also see that garlic is in your food but only in sufficient quantities to accentuate the flavor , not to have a taste of its own . You will object that in that case you will be distinguished by an unpleasing odor . But in a whole gay population which consumes garlic you yourself , having consumed it and being gay , will not be so distinguished , neither will your neighbors . Those terrible inquisitors , the physicians of to-day , have discovered that in garlic is to be found the real fountain of youth . So they are prescribing it for you ? for almost all complaints ? but synthetically and flavorlessly . The doctor is like the priest . He tries to kill joy , but along the lines of your superstitions and fears . We ? you and I Anglo Saxons ? are trying to-day with our cookery to condone the sins of our Puritan ancestors . It is the only Puntanism that remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in Great Britain , which is not yet America . So we let the physician replace the priest to whom we no longer resort ; and the doctor , knowing that our superstitions trend that way , knowing that we think it sinful to take a delight in the palates that the good God has given us for our health and delight ? the doctor insists that we eat things tasteless , unconditnented , unassoiled , unblest ? and horribly productive of what in this country is , I believe , called " gas , " but to which our grosser shepherds give a more romantic name . Let us , then , limit the term the American cuisine to the admirable , the almost perfect , meats that negroes here prepare in their culinary ecstasies . For no negress knows how she cooks . Neither do I when I cook . I use every- thing within sight in a frenzy resembling a whirlwind , and it takes an army of scullery maids to clean up the kitchen after me . But you wo n't have a headache after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me finish with a story ? for people like stories . When I was last in London I listened to a dialogue of two young women of the shop-assistant type on the top of a bus . Says the first , " You are n't out with your toff to-night ? " Says the second , " No , I says to ' im , Charley , you 've ' ad me out every night this week . We 've bin to Lyon 's Corner House , to the A. B. C. , to the Carlton Grill , and the Savoy . I do n't know where we ' ave n't bin . And what I says is , " Give me a rest . Let me stop at ' ome and eat something out of a tin . " ' I thought it might have been New York . And upon my soul I do n't know whether I ought to have rejoiced because the populace is revolting against the food provided in public places or whether I ought to have cried 0 tempura 0 mores     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
