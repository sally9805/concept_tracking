txt Ratification by Convention . In today 's issue , in discussing the Eighteenth Amendment Congressman Grant Hudson of Michigan , in answer to the question , - " Why have we never had a referendum ? " is reported to have said : " In ' the name of God , there is no method by which we could have a referendum . " This seems very strange , because the amending clause of the Constitution , Article V. , expressly provides that . proposed amendments may be submitted to the people acting directly in their State conventions  --  the method by which the people originally ratiled the Constitution itself . Such conventions , which in contemplation of law are the people , in fact must be elected alter proposal upon the direct issue of ratification vel non . This gives a popular vote upon the ratification of an amendment substantially a referendum . The Congress refused to submit the Eighteenth Amendment to the people thus acting , but for haste ( there could be no other reason ) insisted on submitting it to " legislatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking a popular mandate , all elected in a confusion with other issues . Had the Eighteenth Amendment been submitted to State conventions , elected upon the direct issue alone , and therefore certainly recording the will of their constituents , there would be no question raised about the absence of a referendum . GEORGE STEWART BROWN . Brooklyn , Feb. 3 , 1824.
