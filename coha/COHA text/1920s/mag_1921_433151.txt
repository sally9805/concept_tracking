NEVER would I consent to write about France 's present-day politicians without making it clear that the politicians are not the French people . For it is impossible , with the utmost indulgence , for anyone who has honestly regarded them at work to refrain from some criticism of 1 hem . Unfortunately , there has grown up a fallacy that , in speaking without flattery of a country 's accidental and temporary leaders , one is in some way attacking the country . It is not so : for my part , I think France is relatively sound . The French people have superb qualities ; they deserve all the eulogies that have been or could be written of them , though naturally they have not escaped the contagion of the world-sickness . They haveshown a solid sense , a rooted stability , a laboriousness , that are beyond praise . If France has ever shown signs of revolutionary tendencies , ? as she did during one period at least , ? it has been because she was misguided ; and she quickly recovered herself . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to run into excesses , whether of Militarism or of Socialism . Always does the restraining force of the people keep the wilder spirits ? whether those wilder spirits are Nationalist ministers or Communist agitators ? in check . Whenever I wish to know the true sentiments of ordinary folk , I make a little tour of the cabarets of Paris . In the revues there presented I am per- petually surprised at the healthy rear . Lion against Bolshevism on the one hand and against flamboyant and fir , eating patriotism on the other hand ( though it must be confessed that every chansonnier has his couplet against England ) . Anyone who supposes than the people liked the call-up of ( ' lass In of the army , the demobilization , the remobilization , and the demobilization again of young Frenchmen ; anyone who supposes that the French people IONT to indulge in flourishes and 11101111 ( TS toward Germany , threats of occupation , of dislocation , vauntings of eir , tory and vainglorious strutting , need only listen intelligently to the skits on drum-beating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ly . Ministers and Muscovites are good game : they are not angrily railed at , they are wittily satirized ; they are for the most part tolerated as indvilalik and not particularly important . I heard nearly every politician of wile twitted , with the full approbat ion ? lithe audience . To tell the truth , throughout the history of the Republic , Par . Foment and Cabinet have been held in little esteem , while President after President has been mercilessly mocked . There is , in short , a curious separation of people and rulers ; and the rulers do not always adequately represent the sentiments of the people . For Illy part , I do not know any country in which this division is more marked . Nor , oddly enough , do the journals which are read by everybody reflect , in their politics , the spirit of the people : they reflect the particular view of the Qua ' d'Orsay and of other government offices , from which , by an elaborate system , they receive the mot d'ordre . Less and less am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reading of the French newspapers . Public opinion , in the sense in which the term is now employed , is merely the passing opinion of a passing minister , transmitted through ' inspired ' journalists . Many misconceptions about the French may be avoided if it is remembered how deliberate is the present met hod of doping the journals . As for the foreign pressmen , it is unhappily true that the red ribbon which indicates the Legion of Honor exercises a hypnotic effect on many of them . I know some who lose no opportunity of writing comfortable things , of placing themselves at the disposition of the propaganda service which has been openly set up ? and of submitting their claims to be decorated at due intervals . The very word propaganda , since the war , has become obnoxious . It is not , of course , a peculiarly French institution all governments now advertise , like automobile manufacturers or soap-makers , and have brought the art of suppression , of distortion , of extravagant praise , to a point where it slops over into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of note , are particularly ftited , and columns of the newspapers are devoted to the tours of American associations . It is probably the French rather than the American organization which is responsible for this fantastic fanfaronnade . I submit that , while we should try to know each other , the present methods of propaganda do not help us to know each other . On the contrary , they serve to rouse suspicion ; and extravagant lauda- tion and obviously official representations of facts provoke only a smile , or even an exclamation of disgust . As an organ for propaganda the press is becoming played out : it has been overworked . This is not , of course , to suggest that the present French politicians do not possess admirable qualities . They are nearly all intensely patriotic ; though patriotism is a virtue that may easily become a vice if pushed to extremes . They have considerable parliamentary ability ; though this again is a merit that was better suited to the pre-war days , when the problems were not of a vast , universal character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of world needs that one regrets to see no truly big figure emerging . But , then , in what country does the world-man emerge ? Where is the stet es-man who sees , what so many thinkers now see , that what the times call for is someone who can lift himself above frontiers , who can escape the limiting moment , whose vision can embrace the future and go round the globe ? It is heartbreaking , when superior intellect , superior emotion , are needed as never before , to subordinate the smaller craft of national parliamentarianism to the bigger task of announcing and realizing the interdependence of the peoples , that more than ever we should be all working in our watertight compartments , doing our partial , uncofirdinated jobs . It may be that the machinery of civilization has outgrown the capacity of its mechanicians . What was good enough before the war is not good enough now ; and the pre-war mind is incapable of grappling with post-war problems . The terms of those problems have changed : they are not affairs of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the peace has thrown up no new men . This is true of all 832 FRANCE AND THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE countries ( excepting Russia , where the new men have indulged in a disastrous experiment ) . It is particularly true of France , where practically all the men worth mentioning are the old , tried men . As I write , I can not forecast what will be done at Washington ; I can only anticipate that the American delegates will be purely American , the British purely British , and the French purely French ; each concerned to defend the narrow interests of his own country , when it is a generous cooperation of all countries that is called for . There are some questions , such as general disarmament , such as a general economic and financial settlement , that nobody seems big enough to tackle seriously and honestly ; nobody seems big enough even to approach them , except with the desire to show that his own nation is in an exceptional position and can not conform to any suggested world-order . Most of the ills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be settled by national statesmen , but only by men with the international mind , men with an outlook as broad as mankind . There are no sectional cures : there are only radical remedies . H. G. Wells , in his ( ) liaise of History , says of the politicians of a certain Roman epoch that they only demonstrate how clever and cunning men may be , how subtle in contention , how brilliant in pretense , and how utterly wanting in wisdom and grace of spirit . It seems to me , as it seems to Mr. Wells , that this is a true description of most of the politicians of all countries to-day . It most not be supposed that France is in this respect different from other nations . I am bound to say this much ; but , having said it , I must take another measure and paint the French politi- ? cians for what they are . They do not , any more than do the men in power in other countries , reach ideal dimensions : they must be judged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that three , at least , of the little group of men who are most conspicuous in French politics , who have climbed to the heights of power , began their career as Socialists . Robert Louis Stevenson , I remember , suggests somewhere that most of us begin as revolutionaries and end up , somewhere about middle age , as conservatives . Certainly it would be difficult to find better examples of this inevitable evolution in the human spirit than are furnished by that trio , Alexandre Millerand , Aristide Briand , and Rend Viviani . Of course , it is foolish to make a charge of inconsistency . No man can be judged by his youth . It is to their credit that , before they acquired the reticences of later year before they learned that progress is slow and must be orderly , these distill. guished Frenchmen were aflame with the passion of putting the world to rights . However violently , in certain cases , aspirations toward a better order of things were expressed ; however in. candescent were their sympathies with the downtrodden ; however excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were moved by essentially noble impulses . He is , in. deed , a poor man who has never felt wild yearnings , has never been guided rather by the heart than by the head . When I look round the political field in France , I am invariably surprised with the recurring discovery that not only these three , but nearly all prominent publicists and politicians , have passed through this stage of ardent , if unruly , enthusiasm . They have not entered the arena coldly , calculatingly : They became gladiators because of their generous emotions . They have been shaped into what they are to-day by experience . This is excellent , and is entirely in their favor . It may be that instances could be discovered where the ensuingdisillusionment has induced nieism . But , on the whole , such a beginning is a proof of sincerity . On the other hand , they are naturally open to the attacks of the Communists of to-day , who frequently quote against them their speeches of other days and show that they now oppose that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1896 , in a famous discourse , proclaimed the right to strike ; and in 1910 , following a strike , he instituted proceedings against the Confederation Generale du Travail , which have helped to bring this association of trade-unions to its present position of impotence . He was , again , a foremost figure in anti-clerical movements and liquidated the congregations , while during his premiership last year he commenced the negotiations for re6stabiishing relations with Rome . It is , however , a peculiarly little mind that would make these apparent reversals of policy a reproach . There was a moment when it was important , above all , to assert he right to strike . There was another moment when the superior interests of the country demanded the suppression of dangerous agitation . There was a moment when the priesthood had become mischievous in France and menaced the Republic . And there was another moment when diplomatic reasons urged the appeasement of the old religious quarrel . Those abstract politicians who forget that circumstances are of more importance than doctrines arc open to criticism . Whatever M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he entered the cabinet of Waldeck-Rousseau as the first Socialist minister , he initiated many remarkable social reforms . To him are due pensions , a weekly rest-day for workers , and the shortening of hours for women and children employed in industry . Most of his ministerial work has been in connection with internal affairs . He has been an able organizer ; he is a hard worker of the dogged rather than the brilliant kind . Certainly he is tenacious . When he became Prime Minister after the defeat of M. Clemenceau , who had expected to become President of the Republic , French opinion was just beginning to turn against the authors of the treaty , and was beginning to proclaim that England ( to employ a French expression ) had taken most of the blanket for herself . Mr. Lloyd George , regarded as too clever by half , was beginning to be cordially detested in France ; and it was not long before M. Clemenceau was accused of having given way on almost every point to the British Premier . The old Tiger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman of the Third Republic , now discovered that the Tarpeian Rock was near to the Capitol . There were even clamors for his trial in the High Court of Justice , for having sacrificed French interests in favor of his friends , the English . The task of M. Millerand , following this amazing fall of M. Clemenceau from the heights of popularity to the depths of unpopularity , was difficult . It was his function to resist Mr. Lloyd George . With his shrewd sense , however , he was aware that a compromise with Germany was inevitable and desirable . But behind him was the clamorous Bloc National , refusing , even in the name of a policy of realism , any further concessions to Germany in respect of reparations , and declining to take any practical step which might be construed as a concession to British views . There began a long-drawn-out fight between France and England . The attempt to get away from the sentimentalism of the Versailles Treaty , with its grotesquely impossible demands on Germany , was rendered hard by the suspicions of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew ; and every time that Germany 's debt was defined ( still in unreasonable terms ) , M. Millerand was in danger of being overthrown . More time was needed for the truth to dawn on the politicians , not only of France , but of the Allies generally ? the truth that there are limits , easily reached , to the transfer of wealth from one country to another ; that , speaking broadly , wealth can be transferred only in the shape of goods which it is against the industrial and commercial interests of the receiving country to accept . This truth has also its application to America , who can be paid what is owing to her by the Allies only in the form of goods which she puts up tariff barriers to keep out . Gradually the world is awakening to the fact that the only rational policy is one which consists in canceling , not of necessity nominally , but virtually , the bulk of international debts , German or Allied , and in resuming as quickly as possible normal trade-relations . This does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reparations . She should be made to pay all that it is possible for her to pay ; but chiefly she should be obliged to help in the rebuilding of the ruined North , as now , at long last , she promises to do under the Loucheur-Rathenau accord , which makes hay of the treaty and of the London Agreement , and of the principle of collective negotiations and action against Germany . France has , I think , reached a point where the more or less willing cooperation of victor and vanquished is seen to be necessary . But when M. Nlillerand was in power , he was unable to carry out such a policy . At Spa , where he consented to meet the Germans , matters only became worse . It was assuredly not his fault . Events could not be hurried . It will still take some years before Europe can get far on the right lines . But it must be said of M. Millerand that he did at Spa adumbrate the possibility of voluntary arrangements . M. Millerand would not be human if Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in this atmosphere of opposition between France and England every excuse for his desire to demonstrate the indepen. dence of France ? not to be forever subordinate to England . There were several incidents that appeared to be inspired by a determination to Meal the supposed hegemony of England . The Entente is not to be lightly thrown away ; but some of the consequences of the Entente , when they run coon . ter to French policy , must be destroyed . M. Millerand may be looked upon as a friend of the Entente , but an enemy of British domination . Thus , he revolted against the British tolerance of Ger . many 's non-fulfillment of her obligations , by marching on Frankfort . Then , against the express advice of England , he recognized Wrangel , that anti-Bolshevist adventurer whose moment of glory soon passed . Then he took Pa. land 's part when Poland had foolishly provoked a war with Russia , and England counseled conciliation ? sending General Weygand to save Warsaw . It was precisely this lucky stroke which secured for him the Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating back the Bolsheviki front before Warsaw ? but the miracle happened . He soared into popularity , and as , at that time , M. Deschanel , the President , had fallen ill and was compelled to resign , he was carried triumph . antly to the Elyse ? . It may be taken that , as President , M. Millerand exercises more authority than most of his predecessors have exercised . He is extremely strong-willed , and on his acceptance of his seven-year poss. declared that he intended that the he would call should carry out premiers his policy . In France it is not as in : thlerica : the President has , constituthmally , little power . The executive chief is the Premier , who is respondble to Parliament and whom Parliamein can make or break . Nevertheless , a man like M. Millerand , if he is surrounded by influential supporters and has really the favor of Parliament , can become supreme . It is only when he is faced by a Premier who is backed up by Parliament , and whose policy is in opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on pain of being broken , as was President Mac-Mahon . M. Poincare has recently shown that against M. Clemenceau ? then at the height of the power derived from Parliament and people ? he could do nothing , even though he was strenuously against the provisions of the treaty . The president may he indeed nothing in France , and the Elysee may he a prison . There are those who assert that M. Poincare , who now enjoys much backing , would have been earlier called to the premiership had not M. Millerand passed him over , just as M. Poincar6 for a long time passed over NI . Clemenceau . However that may be , Leygues , who succeeded M. Mille-rand as Premier , was little more than the nominee of M. Millerand , carrying out his instructions . M. Briand presently succeeded M. Leygues , and although M. Briand is far from being colorless , Premier and President have worked amicably together , and M. Millerand nay be considered to be still in the ascendant , still the supreme authority in France , in fact as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other French politician , has won the reputation of being shrewd and skillful in emergencies . If one wishes for confirmation of this opinion , it is necessary to see him in a light corner . He knows hose to get out of tight corners better than anyone . It may sometimes be thought that he might have avoided getting into tight corners . Now M. Briand is a line manceuvrer : it is exhilarating to watch him placing his opponents , when they are most cocksure , in an impossible situation . His met hod of speech-making is a lesson in Parliamentary strategy . It is odd that , in a country so renowned for its eloquence , the written speech is so common . Often have I seen an orator who has gained great fame take out of his pocket his typewritten reply to a simple expression of thanks for attending a luncheon , and proceed to read formal or flowery phrases . It is somewhat disconcerting to the Anglo-Saxon who is used to impromptu speeches ? the substance of which is doubtless well prepared , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . It is with us regarded as a confession of weakness , a sign of artificiality , to hold in one 's hands the evidence of careful study . We have at least to pretend to spontaneity . The form is thus sacrificed , but the appearance of sincerity is saved . But with the French the form counts for much . Out comes the written document , and only its forceful delivery preserves for it its effect of directness . But M. Briand is not one of those French orators who not only rehearse but write their speeches . On the contrary , his efforts are nearly always impromptu . This is essentially characteristic of the man . He is the improviser par excellence . He is an , amazing virtuoso . In France they say that he plays the violoncello . ' He plays it without the music before him . He plays it precisely as the occasion suggests . He would , perhaps , be singularly embarrassed were lie called upon to play a set piece . He loves to embroider , to compose as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the call of circumstance . This is true of his speeches ? but it is also true , in a larger sense , of his politics . It may indeed be taken as a parable and illustration of the man ? this habit of his to search in his audience the words , the ideas , which he utters . There are times when one might pardonably suppose M. Briand to be tired , indifferent ; not to put too fine a point upon it ? lazy . But t his impression is altogether wrong . M. Briand is like Mr. Lloyd George inasmuch as he relies largely on his intuition , his immediate judgments , his ever-ready resources . He conies into the Chamber apparently without anything particular to say . He reads an official statement in a dull voice . He seems to be bored , and so does the Chamber . There is an atmosphere of hostility . One wonders what will be his fate . And then , discarding the official statement , without notes , without ( so far as one knows ) any preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he feels his way cautiously . His voice takes on a new animation . There is an interruption . Somebody in the Chamber reveals the ground of antagonism . This is what M. Briand is waiting for . He applies himself to that point ; he develops his theme . He vanquishes this particular opposition , only , perhaps , to arouse opposition from the other side of the house . This gives him a fresh start . He seems to seek to penetrate the minds of his opponents in order to demolish their objections . Now lie pits the Right against the Left , and now he rouses the Left to enthusiasm . It is the most beautiful balancing of views it is possible to conceive . Speeches , it is sometimes said , never change a vote in parliamentary assem blies . This may be true of parliaments like the British , where two , or , at the most , three parties sit on their benches with their minds made up , ready to obey their party whip . But it is not true of M. Briand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where the possibilities of combination are as numerous as the combinations of a pack of cards . He knows , as few men know , how to shuffle them ? how to lead this card and then that . In his way he is certainly the most masterly parliamentarian who has ever been known in France . If proof were necessary , it would be found in the fact that seven times has he been called upon to govern ; and this year , in spite of his reputation of belonging to the Left , he has performed the extraordinary feat of governing largely with the support of the Right . For that matter , he belongs , in the formal sense , neither to the Right nor to the Left . He has no party . He has , strictly speaking , no following . Ile remains , when he is not in office , alone and apart . Well does he know that , when the situation becomes unmanageable , when the Parliamentary team is difficult to drive , his day will again come . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances ? combine their rOle of politician with the rOle of journalist , and , when they are not responsible for the government , become the most powerful critics of the government in the press . Such has been the life of M. amenceau . Sometimes he has been premier , and at other times he has been a formidable antagonist of the premier , thee . dering against him , not from the tribune , but from the newspaper that he directed . Now , although M. Briand , like most other French politicians , began his career as journalist , he never takes up the pen in the intervals of office . He does hardly any lobbying ; he rarely commits himself in any way . He sits silent until his hour shall again strike . Always is he something of an enigma . Always does he allow the Left to ose sup-p he is their man , and the Right to believe that he is not against them . In the clash and confusion of rival ambitions , it is Briand , the man who makes no useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still tongue although he possesses a winning tongue , who is chosen . The speeches that he makes when he is assailed , and the position has become difficult , are the most persuasive speeches that may be heard ; but when I read them at length the next ( lay , I generally find that they are full of repetitions and even of contradictions . That is because he addresses himself , now to this side , then to that side . To know the true Briand , it is not sufficient to hear or to read his speeches . One has to remember whom he is addressing , and what is his immediate purpose . One has to be able to distinguish between what is meant for one party , what for another party ; what is meant for France and what is meant for Germany ; what is meant for England and what is meant for other countries . I trust that this portrait does not suggest a mere opportunist , in the worst sense of the term . M. Briand certainly is an opportunist , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that he stresses now one point and then another point . It was M. Briand who spoke of the occupation of the Ruhr , and it was M. Briand who condemned such a policy as inept . The occasion has always to be considered . But he is an opportunist only as a sailor is an opportunist . When the wind blows from the west , he must spread his sails accordingly ; but when the wind veers to the north , he must trim his sails anew . But the sailor knows where he is going and keeps his course . M. Briand has a policy , and he sticks to his policy in spite of apparent and momentary contradictions . He has to reconcile many opinions , and he has to bring the Ship of State safely toward the land that he sees ahead . There are , of course , different kinds of opportunists , and to use the word without discrimination as a term of opprobrium is altogether wrong . In my opinion , for example , Mr. Lloyd George , who is undoubtedly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds of concessions , all kinds of seeming stultifications of his judgment , kept along exactly the same path in international affairs that he indicated to me and to others in March , 1919 . When he has seen rocks in the way , he has gone round them . It is so with M. Briand , whose points of resemblance with him could be multiplied . Perhaps it is only the fool who steers straight ahead . One of the chief grievances of a certain section of French politicians is that M. Briand , in calling up Class 19 for the occupation of the Ruhr , did so to discredit that policy and to make its repetition impossible . As to this I will express no opinion ; but it will readily be conceived that a politician may appear to do the opposite of that which he intends to do . M. Briand is not a native of Brittany for nothing . It is from Brittany that France recruits most of her sailors . M. Briand is an expert sailor . The truth is that M. Briand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose either to defend or to attack him : I wish merely wish to state the facts as I see them ; and it is in this spirit that I record my impression , which is corroborated by conversations of a more or less private character that have come to me from friends ? conversations in which he has expressed himself with surprising moderation . He is far from being the implacable taskmaster of Germany that he has been represented to be on account of certain episodes . No one knows better than does M. Briand the true need of France ? the need of a policy that will reconcile old enemies and establish some measure of economic cooperation Europe . No one realizes more the need for a reduction of armaments , which is possible only if better relations exist in Europe . France at this moment has an army that is big enough to conquer the Continent . France is not , strictly speaking , obliged to take heed of the opinion of anyone . She can adopt any coercive methods she pleases , and there is no country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fatal course . Not only would it be folly to fly in the face of the world 's opinion , but France would certainly not obtain any satisfaction in the shape of additional reparations . The army , whether it is put at 800,000 men or at 700,000 , is a tremendous burden for is country in economic difficulties , and all sensible men must desire its reduction . It is a. burden on the finances of the country , but it is also a burden on ? the individual Frenchman , who has to spend what should be the most vital preparatory years of his life in idleness and the demoralizing milieu of the barracks . There are those who urge , with justice , that , in the economic struggle , Germany will enjoy a great advantage over France by reason of the fact that she is compelled to keep her army at a negligible number , while France has to support a huge body of non-producers . How could any sane person wish to maintain the army at anything like its present level ? But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is secured , no matter what sacrifice must be made , no matter what handicap must be borne , M. Briand , I believe , is all in favor of making such amicable arrangements with Germany as will enable France to forget this terrible preoccupation of her security , Doubtless he , like all other French statesmen , would prefer that Ameriiiii and England , as promised at the Peace Conference , should come into a trims .. ite military pact . But he is not , as I understand , an advocate of what amounts to perpetual occupation , or of detachment of the Rhineland from the Reich , as are M. Poinear6 , M. Tatdiot and M. Maurice Barris . The most sif nifieant thing that was done under his ministry was the signing of the Liucheur-Rathenau accord , which envisages the collaboration of France and Germany , which ( provided Germany remains a non-militaristic republic ) presages some sort of friendship between the two countries that , in spite of their hereditary hatreds , intensified since the Armistice , have to live side by side . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can compose their age-long differences . There is no middle course . IV This brings me to M. Louis Louchour ? easily , in my opinion , the most remarkable figure in French political life . I said just now that there were no new men . I must modify that statement . Loucheur is a new man . Ile lane new methods . He is not a politician , although he is in politics . He is the hardness man . In France the politicians have become what might , not disrespectfully , be called an ' old gang . ' M. Loucheur was not even a deputy when he became minister . He brings a fresh mind to the public problems . He has no prejudices , no traditions , no long training along political lines . He is accustomed to see things as they are . He does not idealize them ; he is not a sentimentalist , dealing in abstractions , ltv1 ) - notized by catch-phrases , as are politicians generally . For me he represents an immense force . He towers over all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore I shall not assert dogmatically that M. Loucheur will , for the next ten  --  if not twenty ? years , be the real power behind French politics . All I will venture to say is that , at the present moment , he is the man who matters most , and that he should be looked upon , not in his ministerial capacity , but as a tnan . That is to say , that he will probably continue to occupy a nominally subordinate post . It is extremely unlikely , in my judgment , that he will form a cabinet and put himself at the head of French politics . He is far more likely to remain in the back- ; ; round . But it would be folly to regard him as a supernumerary . He has brains ; he has ability ; he has energy ; he is used to dealing in realities , and he thinks in terms of realities . I do not know whether it has been remarked how unreal politics tend to become , and in what an imaginary world politicians walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was not corrupted by his environment . He had the advantage of not serving an apprenticeship to politics . He passed through none of the intermediary stages . During the war he controlled numerous companies , and is reputed to be extremely rich , to have made a vast fortune . It was M. Clemenceau who appealed to him to lend a hand . It was felt that the practical man was the kind of man who was needed to help in the winning of t he war and the elaboration of the peace . Only rarely does a non-politician , who has not been elected by the People , had himself called to take up a ministerial office ; but in the case of M. Loucheur the experiment was amply last tiled . I am not blind to the possible disadvantages of thus bringing rich business men into the government . The door is obviously opened to certain abuses . Nor do I consider that the rood business man will necessarily make a good minister . Probably the chances are that he will not . But except ional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestiona lily an except imial man . Afterward , of course , his situation was regularized by his election . He has remained minister through several administrations , and in one capacity or another his services will continue to be enlisted . It was M. Loucheur who init titled the policy of direct negotiations with Germany , and who oriented France toward the idea of reparations in kind . Had it been possible to impose upon Germany , three years ago , the essential task of repairing the ruined regions of France , there is little doubt that by this time France would have been largely restored ; and the speedy restoration would have been wools far more than the nebulous milliards . The two countries would already have settled down on terms of decent neighborliness . Unhappily , everybody was mesmerized by the glittering promise of immense sums hitherto unheard of ? sums that could be expressed only in astronomical figures . The consequences might have been foreseen ? but they were not , except by the economists . The consequences ore the collapse of Germany and the collapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done in time , Germany is doomed to bankruptcy . Now , Germany is necessary to Europe , , just as Carthage was necessary to ancient Rome . The foolish destruction of Carthage by the Romans deprived them of a base for the Eastern Mediterranean sea-routes . It is easy to look back and make these criticisms . What is of more importance is to look forward , and to appreciate the fact t hat , if Germany did not exist , it would be necessary to invent her . Nothing more stupid than that policy which would erase Germany from the map of Europe could , I think , be conceived . Presently , in view of the impending bankruptcy of Germany , it will be necessary to decide between her destruction and her salvation . Should this nation be broken up into fragments ; should there be dislocation , economic anarchy , political chaos ? Or should there be an abandonment of the system of coercion , of financial squeezing , and such a collaboration be substituted as would enable all countries to draw specific advantages from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is the terrific question that must soon be answered in one sense or another . The decision will be determined by the stress that French opinion lays upon certain things . So-called security would seem to suggest the break-up of Germany , politically and economically . This security , however , would be fallacious . In a military sense , France would undoubtedly be secure ; but there are also economic considerations . One bankruptcy will entrain another , and no man can foresee the end of the happenings in Europe . On the other hand , it is dreadfully hard to reconcile one 's self to foregoing claims that have been made and prom-ices that have been held out . The choice is , or would appear to be , between two evils . But perhaps the second would turn out to be not an evil at all . I must content myself with posing the problem in an objective manner . Now , the Loucheur-Rathenau accord is of tremendous import . It is pretended that it supplements , and does not supplant , the London Agreement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks , made in virtue of the treaty . In reality , however long the pretense is kept up , it must be taken as an entirely new system . The London Agreement asks for impossible sums spread over an impossible period of years , and is already breaking down , since Germany simply can not go on meeting her obligations . The Loucheur Agreement stipulates that Germany shall pay in goods , in materiel , a limited amount for the next five years , not to the Allies in general , but to France in particular . This means that common bargaining is abandoned . It means that France , preparing for the crash , is endeavoring to secure for herself , as she has in equity an undoubted right to do , a certain portion of her credits on Germany , and is anxious at least to have the North repaired . It is possible that , when Germany ceases to pay everyone else , she will continue to pay France in kind . She can hardly do both , and it seems to me that France is contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voluntary arrangement with Germany . As France for the next five years may be paid more than is doe to her under the London Agreement , she might be satisfied , and might not resort , in exasperation , to methods of coercion and of sanctions . France , be it noted , is the only country which could or would resort to serious coercion and sanctions . This policy of M. Loucheur , then , is intensely realist , and denotes a complete change in the manner of regarding the Franco-German problem . It foreshadows a very much wider system of co8peration . It may be the turning-point in European affairs . Its bearing upon the possibility of land-disarmament is obvious . V It would be foolish to be too optimistic . Not all French statesmen think on these lines . There is M. Raymond Poincare , the ex-President of the Republic , who will , in all probability , be called at an early date to the premiership , can-trolling the destinies of France . I think I am betraying no secret when I say that the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same system of collaboration with Germany . But he reserves that policy for the future . For the present , to judge him by his writing , ? and he is the most prolific journalist in France , contributing regularly to the Reese des Deus Mondes , the Temps , and the Mean , ? he believes in turning the screw on Germany as tightly as it may he turned . He was thrust aside by M. Clemencaum in the peacemaking . Although President , he was reduced to silence . He had no effective way of pro . testing , but he has put on record , in a memorandum addressed to M. Clemenemu , his strong opinion that the limitation of the period of occupation of Germany to fifteen years was disastrous for France . He would have the occupation extended to such time as it will take Germany to fulfill all the mone. tory obligations of the treaty ? which , being interpreted , means forever . M. Tardicu , the chief assistant of M. Clemenceau , argues that this right is actually conferred by the treaty itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . M. Poincare , in addition , has always shown himself to be one of those ardent , patriotic Frenchmen who believe that the contemporaneous existence of a strong Germany and a prosperous , secure France is impossible . After he retired from the Presidency , he was made Chairman of the Reparations Commission . He resigned because the Reparations Commission showed a tendency to reduce the German debt to more manageable proportions . At each suncessive abandonment of some French right , he has fulminated against the Premier in office . One can only suppose that , when he becomes Premier himself , he will carry out his policy of no concessions . No concessions , now that the original demands are shown to be , however justified , inexecutable , spells the final ruin of Germany , and , as most people think , the greater embarrassment of France . It is perhaps wrong to suppose that a statesman in office will behave as a statesman out of office writes . He is bound to modify his conceptions in accordance with changing circumstances and proved facts . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to be . I should certainly describe him as the most formidable of the politicians proper in France . He has a tremendous force . He has been peculiarly consistent in his attitude toward Germany , from the days when he was raised , as a bon Lorrain , to the Presidency in the year before the war . His prestige is enormous . There are living at this moment no fewer than four former Presidents of the Republic . As the term of office is seven years , this is a somewhat remarkable fact . But whoever hears of Emile Loubet , or of Armand Fallieres ? They have gone to trim their vines or to live quietly in complete obscurity . After their occupation of the Elysee , there was no place for them in public life . M. Deschanel , it is true , is a member of the Senate , but he is only nominally in politics . M. Poincare is made in another mould . Still comparatively young , with h an alert mind , full of ambition unsatiated , believing that he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buried alive , and is taking a notable revenge for his impotence during the latter years at the Elysee . He is the indefatigable critic . I regret that my space will not permit me to treat of other French politicians so fully , but these men are , after all , the really representative men of French politics . M. Rene Viviani is a highly successful lawyer , gifted with the most amazing flow of language that it has ever been my lot to listen to . The words simply pour out . Ile has been Premier , and during the early part of I he war performed good service . He has been sent to America on missions not clearly defined ? the vague kind of mission that is meant to awaken sympathy , and , indeed , does so . It was hoped that he might influence Washington with regard to the cancellation of debts ; but as it was afterward found an inopportune moment to broach this delicate subject , he came out with a denunciation of those who made such proposals , on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts . Barthou is an impetuous patriot , a somewhat fiery man , conspicuous as a supporter of the Three Years ' Military Service Law . He has written , with rather more intimacy than some of us think justifiable , of the private affairs of Sainte-Beuve and Victor Hugo . My own favorite French statesman ? a man whom I consider to be the finest , the noblest , of our time ? is M. Ldon Bourgeois , the colleague of M. Viviani on the French delegation to the League of Nations . His has been a well-filled life , singularly free from intrigue , singularly free from ambition ( he might have aspired to any post , including the Presidency ) , devoted solely to the furtherance of the idea of the League . Before Mr. Wilson had ever made the suggestion of such an organization , Ile was already old in its service . He took the leading part in the deliberations of The Hague . I know him well and am happy to pay a tribute to his kindliness , his simplicity , his unselfishness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourgeois in the world , so hard-working , so self-sacrificing , so single-minded . Among the younger men , M. Andre Tardieu is undoubtedly the ablest , with the best-stored mind . He is inclined to a sort of priggishness , ctf supe riority , that makes him unpopular , but he will probably come into his own age in . There are two officials who will , unless something unexpected happens , play extremely important parts , whether at Washington or at Paris . Of M. Jules Jusserand it is necessarsv to say only that he is respected as the most adequate ambassador that France possesses . He is too well known in America to need my eulogy . England has long envied America his possession . He is tactful , active , and has a unique knowledge ? an altogether indispensable man . He occupies far too strong in position ever to be displaced . If he is left in charge of part of the proceedings at Washington , France will be represented by a , judicious , sagacious , likable man , not likely to make any mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent staff at the Quai d'Orsay is Philippe Ben thelot . Berthelot has a memory that is an encyclopeedia of foreign affairs . There are archives at the Quai d'Orsay , but the real archives are under the cranium of Philippe Berthelot . In France ministries change frequently . Often no record ? or an insufficient record ? is kept of negotiations engaged in by the predecessors of the minist ries in power . But Philippe Berthelot knows . He can supply the information , He is sometimes the only man who can supply it . It may be urged that it is bad business to give one man the extraordinary power that is thus given to M. Berthelot ; but he is sound anal shrewd , and whenever he is directly responsible for policy , his judgments are excellent . He is the son of the famous chemist W ho instituted and developed research work in the properties of coal . M. Bert helot in his early days explored and studied China , and is an authority on Asiatic matters . Ministers may come and ministers may go , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
