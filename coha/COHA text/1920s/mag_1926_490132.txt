THE question whether the Public Library should bow to the conventions of the age and get itself sand-blasted or sit quietly and grow dirtier and dirtier is a perennial one . The first week in August is our usual time for considering it , and this year we took a look at the library and decided it was so dirty we could n't tell anything . We think , however , that if it were cleaned up a bit we might reach some decision , so we suggest sand-blasting . AGAIN the irony of things . A guest room in the country should have a writing table and fresh ink so that you can write the maid at home that you are returning earlier than you expected , a lamp by the bed and a case of the latest books so that you can leave your host early and console yourself upstairs , and an easy-chair or daybed so that during the day you can retire when bored to extinction . After years of longing , last week we occupied this perfect guest room . And immediately we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a room there would never be any occasion for using it . FOR a long time there have been ugly rumors about the druggists , and last week thirty or forty of them were arrested for adulterating whisky . This is the most alarming news of the season . No human being is so hardened as to lack all faith , and many have imposed their trust in certain professional men . Bridge . builders , firemen , nurses , taxicab drivers , locomotive engineers , doctors  --  all these more or less inspire confidence and a belief in their infallibility , but none of them more than the men who have filled our prescriptions . Even when the pharmacists turned to bootlegging we thought they were honest bootleggers . Now it appears they are not . The roots of the Volstead cancer are deep indeed . WE HAVE long watched with apprehension the emptiness of the magnificent goldfish bowl in the old Plaza bar , now the Gentlemen 's Coffee Room .

The modern guest , thoughtfully and with his customary regard for the property of other people , throws cigar ashes into the water and kills the fish . IN THE day of 100 per cent humidity , as we staggered dripping with moisture up Park Avenue , we met a man wreathed in smiles , jaunty in get-up , and altogether obnoxious-looking . Being until that moment a friend of his , we touched him on the shoulder and demanded an explanation . " I know , " he said sympathetically , " hut I 've just become engaged and expect to be married on the eleventh of September and ca n't help feeling a little glad about it . " We looked at him incredulously and staggered on , murmuring our forgiveness . ONCE more we have proof of the theory that fashions travel in cycles , and that , if one waits long enough , what is outmoded today may become the dernier eti of tomorrow .

SPEAKING of Polite Transportation , we are flatly against the new pay-as-you-enter regulation of the bus company . It marks , we think , a further degeneration of the policy of considering the comfort of the passenger that marked the halcyon days before the company changed hands . A regulation that permits the conductor to stand on the rear platform may 8 THE NEW YORKER save rear-end collisions . We do n't know . We have traveled on busses ever since they were drawn by horses and happen never to have seen a rear-end collision that was serious . We only know that to pay as you enter is inconvenient and should not be a part of " Polite Transportation . " The bus company has long been the only company in the city to give the passengers ' comfort a thought , and we hate to see it showing its teeth , particularly at a time when it is asking for city-wide franchises . Persistence IT was a fair lady , star of a play which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly on the story of her life . She mentioned that she had left school after the fifth grade , and in the prettiest manner possible she deplored this deficiency of education , which had cost her , she said , any amount of effort to mend in later life . " I think everybody ought to have a complete education , " she went on with charming earnestness . " If possible I think they should even go through high school . " Saratoga Eternal IGGER and better than ever , " say the old Saratogans . " Much more of a season than last year , " reports our eyewitness from the Spa , although no enormous bets , no spectacular racing upsets , no phenomenal sums won or lost , have been registered at the present writing . The track is as charming as ever  --  the most lovely of our racing backgrounds without a doubt , with the plumed fountains playing and white swans floating on its central lake from which the canoes of former days are mercifully absent . But , alas , the smart equipages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for with the death last year of Mr. William B. Gage , who alone remained faithful to his cabriolet , the last horse-drawn vehicle has disappeared from the parking space . It is comforting , however , that old Sonny , the black replica of Rameses II who used to open your coach door , still performs this service for you if you arrive in a mere motorcar , and still murmurs as you alight , " Put a little sumpin for me , sir , on " ? War Eagle or Gunboat or whatever the horse of the day may be , a tip you should carefully learn to regard in inverse ratio , for if Sonny has recommended a horse it is always wiser to scratch the name mentioned from your betting card . Of course if Sonny 's horse wins there must be a fair distribution of monetary gains , but a person 's sense of justice is unfortunately not often thus aroused . THE monde of Saratoga is still , during the racing season , dominated by Vhitneys , Riddles , and Wideners , with Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Walter Jeffords , a niece of the Riddles , is one of the ladies most to the fore where horses are concerned . Mr. A. Charles Schwartz is a newer Saratogan phenomenon . He has been spending this summer in a " cottage " he has rented on Broadway , where true to the tradition of his group , he has installed a croquet set on his lawn . Here one may see the expert and ardent croquet fiends who have momentarily transferred their activities from Central Park or Long Island , and if any high stakes of the season are ru mored they are more apt to emanate from the croquet lawn than the race track . ASIDE from croquet the great ex-citement of the season is polo . Saratoga is in fact all agog over the new polo field and the polo season that is to be inaugurated this month . Mr. Stuart Don has been the prime local mover for polo in the Spa , aided and abetted by Mr. Skiddy Von Stade , whose claim to fame in Saratoga depends not only on his brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the famous " Bottle House , " the mansion well known to all visitors and inhabitants for its concrete walls liberally encrusted with bottle tops and bits of bottle glass . BUT polo and croquet aside , Saratoga days move much as always . Six A.M. rising for the more ardent of the devotees to watch the horses being tried out , bed again , a late morning of golf , races and betting for the afternoons , and to top off , an evening of dancing , this year more often than not at the Arrowhead since it is there that THE NEW YORKER 9 Vincent Lopez now holds court in person with his orchestra . Vain Attempt THE difficulty of pleasing your captious poets seems to be growing . A New York lyricist recently had occasion to visit his young son at boarding school . The matronly principal , wishing to impress and flatter the great man , reported with unction : " A very bright boy , your son . I 've no doubt he 'll be a famous writer like his father when he grows up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully stuttered out , for he does stutter : " Impossible . There 's only one genius in a century , you know . " Yachting FROM far up and down the coast come reports of unexampled activity in yachting ; never before has there been so much money in white duck trousers , never have so many yachting caps been sold , the shipyards been so flooded with orders , and the jewelers so hard pressed to keep enough cocktail shakers on hand to fill the demand . Prosperity is being reflected in the surface of Long Island Sound and the broad Atlantic as well as in the Stock Exchange . Contrary to the expectations of some years ago , it is not the commuting form of yachting that appears to he thriving , but the cruising and the racing form . We hear that at this moment every large yacht that can float is busy doing it . The the boat belonging to Commodore James that has cruised at one time or another all over the world , is in the Sound . Mr. Hutton 's beautiful Huzzar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Putnam 's , 11cyoxe , Mr. Ed Palmer 's Guinevere , Mr. j . P. Morgan 's Corsair , and Mr. T. Chadbourne 's Ripple are all in Atlantic coastwise waters between Hell Gate and Bar Harbor . These are the boats that may cost as much as $100,000 to run for a season . IN a more humble way , the so-called public , the small executives and the salaried men who will pay as high as $5000 for nice roomy little cruisers , are having the time of their lives . It has been found that the cost of oper-ating boats of this class , which , by the way , at the end of three years will have depreciated only fifteen per cent , is less than the cost of operating a $2500 car . You can outfit one of them in spring , live on it in summer with your family , store it during the winter , go where you please , cruise about a thousand miles , and pay all bills except food for less than $5000 . Meanwhile the racing of class boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every Saturday and Sunday the Sound looks as if some giant hand had littered it with bits of white paper . TN a more humble way , the so-called I that when an American bought a yacht he immediately sat down and wondered what he would do with it . His time was taken up with his business and his wife was a bad sailor . The thing , so to speak , had to be exercised ; the hired captain grew fretful if he was n't used . And yachts changed hands rapidly . But they say that today the turnover is much slower , so we presume the problem of the yacht has been solved . Certain types of boats , particularly the roomy cruiser , have at last passed into the realm of the practical . Oddly enough , however , the commuter 's yacht still remains fantastically expensive . We are told that Chicago has done more along that line than we , and that a considerable number of men commute to the Crime City from their places along the lake front in small and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy affair indeed . At the outside , an expert advises us , some forty men indulge in it . Breakfast is served on board while cutting the waves at thirty miles an hour in a neat $75,000 eighty-foot boat . Nothing less expensive will sustain the required speed in the weather met with in Long Island Sound . The yacht comes shooting in to the New York Yacht Club at East Twenty-sixth Street or the Columbia Yacht Club on Riverside Drive at about ten o'clock . And from three to five o'clock in the afternoon , these boats stand by with idling motors awaiting their owners , while the stewards crack the ice and otherwise prepare the proper antidote for a hard day 's work . They are marvelous boats ; but alas ! the round trip to Greenwich and back costs about forty dollars in gasoline alone . You can do it a little more cheaply up and down the Hudson , where smaller boats can run with safety , but the difference is the difference in height between Atlas and Gargantua . At any rate the yachting season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mas- ter Minds has come to our attention . One of the great successes of years ago , " My Sweetheart , " was being offered to Carl Laemmle for cinema production and the film magnate wanted to know what kind of play it was . " It 's a pastoral play , " replied the negotiator . " Nothing doing , " was Laemmle 's curt response . " I do n't like to have preachers in stories . It 's bad for business . " Which reminds us of the days of the World War , when the question of filming " Pudd'nhead Wilson " came up to another producer . " No , " decided the executive , " I do n't want to make any picture that is derogatory to the President " More Freaks INCE our recent dissertation on SINC Fifth Avenue freaks , three more choice candidates have come to our notice . We take pleasure in admitting to the order the energetic old man often seen between eight and ten in the morning along upper Fifth Avenue in the Eighties and Nineties . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip , hop , and sometimes dance . Waving his stick like a band leader , he executes the most complicated military maneuvers , then proceeds smiling on his way , usually walking the cracks with an occasional hop onto the Park wall . THE meek old gentleman fre1 quently seen near Forty-ninth Street is far more sedate and in clothing inclines toward green  --  of that dull shade one associates with stagnant French fountains . His pants are tight and braided , his green coat swallow-tailed , and his high hat adorned with a peacock feather . Most magnificent of all is his cane , which is studded from knob to tip with rubies , diamonds , and emeralds . The old gentleman is very proud of his stick and , passing Cartier 's , he flourishes it magnificently . He usually needs a shave . As does also the large woman often encountered near Thirty-first Street . If masculinely mustachioed , this gay boulevardiere manages to offset her disadvantage by a primitively feminine choice of clothes . On her hat are roses , peaches , and plums . Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers and three bright aprons of different sizes , over which is coquettishly draped another lace curtain . We 've never seen her speak with any one , though once we did hear a gay truck driver accost her familiarly . The fair lady acknowledged his salute with a regal wave of the hand , although the truck driver 's appellation to which she so readily responded was suggestive of a snore Egyptian setting than Fifth Avenue . " Hello , Cleo ? " he shouted . ONE other individual has been mentioned as worthy of our attention but was rejected by the Fifth Avenue Freak Editor . Discarded because her favorite haunt is the 103rd Street Station of the East Side Subway , she is a white-haired Iady , who proffers pamphlets to all who receive her vigorous nudge in friendly spirit . " Fire ! Hell Fire ? " is the tide of one of her booklets ; another is a treatise which tells of such sins of the Sabbath as Sunday bicycle riding . She has told inquirers that hers is missionary work and that she earns her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are agog over a troupe of gypsies which has recently been touring the West Shore , not , alas , in horse-drawn caravans , but in large , practical motor cars . These permit a quick escape after a fortune has been told or money has been magically touched . In our editorial garden , the other day , there sprang up , as if by fairy means , two handsome , strapping wenches , clad in shawls and skirt upon skirt of variegated color . The two men in the garden with us were quickly singled out and drawn aside by the gypsy girls . " I tell your fortune , hein ? " A hand is seized . " Give me your handkerchief . I smell it and know your fate . " A murmur comes from one side , " Oho-o , you have two enemies " ; and from the other , " You are good to your family , " followed by secrets too deep to tell above a whisper . The final ritual , when money is produced , is of blessing a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortune seeker and then against the lips of the fortune teller . One gentleman , not from our garden , let it be said , was so credulous as to hand her $70 , the whole contents of his pocket , for her to bless ( and return ) only to see her disappear with it , at lightning speed , into the gypsy motor . It was ignominiously GOLDMAN 'S RAND PLAYSrescued a day later by the Nyack police force . But in spite of such minor mishaps , the suburbs must welcome so colorful a break in their respectable monotony . It is worth much , indeed , to find Romany within twenty miles of New York . An Adventure ABOUT four o'clock of a recent A afternoon , we made up our minds to set down a biting denunciation of the guardians of the church of God . We had wandered across Tenth Street to Broadway and come upon Grace Church , its delicate white spire rising gracefully above a green lawn , a sweet shrine infinitely restful and inviting , past which New York walks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors and found them all bolted from within ! It was only our indomitable persistence which Ied us to knock at the rectory door on Broadway and be met by the loveliest starched little old lady . It is she who is our story , not the soft , dim silences of the church and chantry through which she let us wander . For we stopped by the sacristy- on the way out to thank her and she became at once delightfully conversational and reminiscent . Our name , it turned out , was the same as that of a famous Grace Church choir boy . In fifteen minutes she led us into a life remote from the world outside , a scented , cloistered life . Behind her words was all the tradition of the great church which she tended , the Grace Church which rose in the glory of God , in 1846 , having come north with fashion from the site of the present Empire Building . SHE showed us the tiny sacristy and her talk was of the small gossip of the cloistered life . We noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chuckled , " once looked at these . ' Hump , ' he said , ' we have a gold one . ' A Bishop ! ' Hump , ' said I , ' but you have n't six silver ones . ' " Next she brought out the great silver plate for the collection . " So heavy for the tiny curates . You know , somehow it seems as if big men do n't go into the clergy any more . There are n't so many now , either . Once our rector had five curates and seven deacons . Now only two assistants . I remember an Faster collection of over fifty thousand dollars . They counted it right on the table here . Oh , we get plenty of money now . But you 'd think  --  with so many automobiles going by these days ... " As she rambled gently on she showed us silver and white linen , the very grand , the ordinary best , the second best , the everyday , the summer ? fine cloths , so carefully put away behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for this service or for that . We hated to reach the end of them , for that meant we must go out into a noisy world where things are not put away carefully . On our way out we passed through a dim corridor . " Look out for that step , " the starched little lady called . " That 's where the visiting Bishops fall . They sit right down and " ? here an almost mischievous note came into her voice ? " sometimes they slide . " Thus conjuring up for us a picture of ruffled dignity over which we are still chuckling .
