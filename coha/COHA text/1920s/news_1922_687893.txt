txt There is nothing especially surprising about what is happening in Germany . A mark worth 51 ) ( 1 to the dollar became inevitable through failure of the bankers ' loan . The assassination of Rathenau was a logical consequence of the German brand of monarchist super-patriotism. elements at play in Germany have been there before . These events do not count for themselves , but for the forces they register . The reason the news from Germany is so alarming is because it is not new . That is the real point . Anything that happens in Germany must be alarming unless it reflects some change for the better in the basic facts about her condition . At present the German case is like a sum in arithmetic : inflation plus political weakness equals disaster . How many American hankers have said the same thing ! But there is nothing new in repeating in other words : a 500-mark dollar plus the murder of Rathenau threatens chaos . If one could inject into the equation a revision of reparations and a large loan or a vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all the other news from Germany is reiteration in the concrete of stat ' : - ments repeatedly made in the abstract . IUM Tel GPI ** Here is a touchstone for new about Germany . - Germany can pay reparations and so take her place in the family of nations when she has an active balance of trade and is able to raise by taxation the money with which she buys foreign exchange to meet her debt to the Allies. ? If what happens in Germany is in the direction of realizing this program . Germany is on the mend ; if not . Germany is still down hill . The slope may be steep or gentle , but it still will be downward . A moratorium for the reparation payment due July 15 , even if granted , does not tend to realize the program . The step which does tend to realize it is fairly well understood . It is an international loan which giv , es Germany a breathing spell from reparations , and which permits stabilization of the mark and industrial recuperation . During this breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her taxing authority would have to be reestablished . Inflation did not bring on collapse in Russia or Austria . What of it if Germany does " collapse ? " What would collapse amount to ? Russia is a poor precedent , for she is an agrarian country and in agrarian countries inflation produces paralysis , not fever . It produced fever in Austria , but the fever could be treated . Austria was fed during the worst winters of her difficulties . If the world can feed twelve times as many Germans as it did Austrians it can allay the fever in Germany too . If not , the fever may have to rage . It is impossible to foretell the way in which Germany will collapse , just as it is impossible to say that the steps to restore are not going to be taken . But if she does collapse it will he the result of contrary political forces pulling her apart . There are two principal cross-currents at play . There is the issue of monarchy vs. republic , which is really militarism vs. labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That there are the two currents is important , for if there were one only , the controversy might be settled . If the only decision were between north and south Germany , Germany might survive , just as the United States did in Lincoln 's day . But what could Lincoln have done with the south if there had been in addition a labor-army feud , involving ten million anti-army trade-unionists ? In a German civil war between labor and the monarchist army , South Germany and the Rhineland might break away from the empire almost unhampered . CON A TING A NEW INDUSTRIAL EMPIRE ' Dismembering Germany probably would mean that the Rhineland would fall to France and Belgium . Once these three  --  Rhineland , French and Belgian industries ? had consolidated , there would stand on the European continent the strongest , the cheapest working , best supplied industrial empire in the world . Would such a consolidation he in the interest . of America ? It is said that we should go on selling our cotton , copper and grain to the same European consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only they could pay us . But what if a new continental power were set up with the strength to rehabilitate Russia ? Would we be able to sell as cheap cotton as Turkestan , or as cheap copper as the Ural mines , or as cheap cereals as the Russian peasant ? And even if this did not take place , would we be able to bid against consolidated western Europe , with its low cost . of production , in other markets ? In China , in South America , in the near east ? Dismembering Germany would mean such a consolidation probably only after a long conflict or a long conflict might terminate in some other conclusion . Even so the disruption might cost the rest of the world an incalculable loss . There is no reason for thinking that the di ; - integration of the German nation would be finished quickly . and there are many to indicate that it would take evea years . IS WIRTH TRYING THE IMPOSSIBLE ? Chancellor Wirth is negotiating- these days with tws parties to enter his government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These parties are the Volkspartei. representing the large husines : - . interests . and the Independent Socialists , who could be termed de-hoishevized radicals . If he succeeds , it might indicate that German business men had set Germany ahead of their past business aims . or that radical , had trimmed their doctrines in a national emergency . or both . Or it might mean merely that the Chancellor was hoping to mia water and oil . At best , it can he only a prelude to the loan and the breathing spell , which alone can help restore Germany . In the meantime , Germany is plunging downward . The dollar parity in Berlin Saturday was 555 , and it might he 750 or 1.000 before Christmas . Every fall means a temporary pinch for the wage and salary earner. and every pinch means unrest . There is no uncertainty about the egregious process . The only uncertainty is about what it may lead to and how soon .                   @ @
