In downtown Chicago three years ago a " Hindu " fakir was put out of business . Bring him the photograph of your enemy , and he would put it face down beneath a rug , walk on it with bare feet reciting an incantation . The enemy would languish into strange death . <P> In downtown New York two years ago men of big business paid $25 to consult an astrologer , who would squint at the stars ( as they did in Babylonia 2,500 years ago ) and tell what stock would rise , what fall . <P> In a town adjacent to Atlantic City five years ago the Chief of Police encountered the Jersey Devil sitting on City Hall Square , shot at him , tried to make an arrest . But the hideous sprite whirred past on infernal wings , and the Chief of Police entered a note to that effect on the station house blotter . <P> Thus eternally , in this age of grace and reason , belief in the powers of darkness has bobbed up . This month it was seething @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and two youths that they killed Nelson D. Rehmeyer , aged hermit and " powwow doctor " of the vicinity , in an effort to cut from his head the magic witchlock . <P> The man was John Blymyer , a rival " powwow doctor . " To him had come young Wilbert G. Hess , upon whose home rested a " hex " or witchly curse . " Cattle died and members of the family were poorly . " Reinforced by the lad John Curry , they went to snatch . Rehmeyer 's witchlock . When he resisted they clubbed him , saturated the body with kerosene , kindled it . <P> Investigation disclosed that eight murders , five of the victims being infants , during the last two years were probably due to witchcraft in the neighborhood . Farm lands and city are gripped by terror of evil spirits and " hexes . " Barns and cowsheds bear strange crosses , hieroglyphics against the " hex . " Black cats are scarce in the county ; for a favorite way of making one 's peace with the Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last bone for an amulet . <P> In the modern , thriving , bustling city of York it is common to see men gather up the hair cut from their heads at the barbershop , take it home with them in paper bags . If the hair were swept out and birds should build a nest with even one strand of it , the head would ache until that nest were beaten down by the weather . <P> A number of manuals of black magic circulate covertly in the vicinity , such as the Himmelsbrief or Heaven Letter , the Seventh Book of Moses and the Long Lost Friend . They give incantations to be said for various diseases , for love , for riches , for vengeance . The incantations mingle scripture , profanity and gibberish in equal measure . <P> To stop hemorrhage , for instance , the " powwow doctor " recites : " Upon Christ 's grave three lilies grow . The first is named youth . The other virtue . The third Subul . Blood stop . " Then he makes the sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seventh Book of Moses covers every conceivable kind of ailment . " It must be spoken three times , three Fridays in succession when the moon is in the taking-off sign . In the morning before sunrise one must go to a flowing stream of water and turn his face in the direction in which the water flows , and on three willow twigs make three knots , in the name of the three most high .
