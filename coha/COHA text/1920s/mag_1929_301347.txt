Pulling his derby far down on his spreading ears-for it would be disrespectful to stand uncovered-Frank Fink stepped panting before the bench of the Jewish Court of Arbitration , a court for New York 's ghetto disputes . " Weh zu mir ! " he wailed ; " Woe is me . " Swaying from side to side he pleaded in stricken Yiddish his complaint against the Abertiner Burying Society , of which he is a member . <P> Ancient rabbinical law declares that men and women should be buried in different parts of the cemetery . And yet ... tsooris ! ... the Society had just sold a plot , for $1,000 , to a man who said he would be buried there side by side with his wife ! It was a scandal , and the Society should be compelled to take back the plot , restore the tainted money ! <P> Now , pulling their derbies likewise down more firmly on their heads , the officers of the Society approached the tribunal . How did they know the purchaser really would be buried beside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be thrown away . The Society needed it to build a wall around the cemetery . The sale was quite orthodox and should be allowed to stand . <P> Solemnly the three judges of the Court , a rabbi and two laymen , pondered . True it was that men and women should not be buried together . But this man in question was not already getting into his grave , accompanied by his wife ! No . The sale of the plot was proper enough , and $1,000 was a good price . Fink was a troublemaker . The sale stood . <P> The Jewish Court of Arbitration meets once every two weeks in a municipal courtroom convenient to the ghetto . It is patronized chiefly by orthodox Polish Jews , who voluntarily seek its help in settling quarrels , almost always on religious matters . Each applicant for justice signs an agreement to abide by the court 's decision , tells his own story informally without the aid of a lawyer , pays 50 toward administration costs .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
