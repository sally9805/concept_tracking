" TIME brings all things . " <P> Toes <P> In Upper Finlay River , British Columbia , one J. Omera , a trapper , suffered frostbite in the four small toes of his right foot . Soon he observed that his bitten toes had become infected . Since there was no surgeon at hand , J. Omera seized a kitchen knife and whittled away for three days until his toes were off . Then he bound up his bloody foot and tramped to Prince George , where a surgeon said he had performed the amputation so efficiently that no further treatment was necessary . <P> Shrew <P> Well aware that the best method of dealing with a shrew is to put her in the water , one George Hall , Manhattan insurance solicitor , was accustomed , when circumstances permitted , to soak Madeleine La Verne Hall , his wife .

Nellie replied : " With love to you with friendship true there is no love I love like I love you . " <P> Joe Sleet : " Say yes now , Nellie , or Papa will have to spank . " <P> Nellie : " Joe , dear , my answer is yes . " In February , Joe Sleet sent Nellie Wallace a ticket and she came to El Paso . He saw then , for the first time , that Nellie Wallace was fat as butter ; she appeared cheerful however and he did not regret his correspondence . They had a wedding . <P> Last week , Joe Sleet was engaged in divorcing his wife . <P> Joe Sleet : " That girl could n't cook . She tried to fry a steak one day and used so much grease it was awful .
