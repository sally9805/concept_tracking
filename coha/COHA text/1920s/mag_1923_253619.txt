How Come ? When Shuffle Along came to town , New York was captivated by a new musical comedy genre . Its plot was bad , its scenery would have been rejected by William A. Brady , and its direction seemed to be an impromptu affair , varying from night to night with the spirit of the entertainers . But it had real Negro jazz music , real dancing and a quality of speed and verve which was unique and refreshing . Strut Miss Lizzie and Liza , which followed , were progressively poorer . The naivete was gone , the speed became a deliberate mechanical effect instead of a natural exuberance , and the delightful " high yella " and " brown skin " flavor , degenerated into a cheap imitation of white musical comedy plus extravagant caricature of the native jazz tradition . How Come , in the opinion of most metropolitan reviewers , is the poorest of the lot . Whatever redeeming quality it has is furnished by Eddie Hunter , the librettist and comedian , who was hailed by the press agents as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the flatness of the surrounding country . <P> Within Four Walls . Like How Come , Within Four Walls is an attempt to commercialize the dramatic residue of previous successes . It is a fourth carbon copy of Little Old New York and Not So Long Ago , with overtones of Plots and Playwrights and Zoe Akins ' The Varying Shore . A series of totally unrelated one-act plays involving incredible incidents in the life of the Minuit family are patched together and stretched across a framework of the Mendelian Law of inheritance , in order to demonstrate that blood will tell and that children are liable to take after their ancestors . The dodge by which historical flavor is achieved is hardly more subtle than having a character say : " Well , so this is 1852 , " together with an assiduous sprinkling of bustles , antimacassars and young ladies with what used to be called " the vapors . " The play is badly staged , poorly written and acted after the manner of an overworked stock company . <P> Percy Hammond : " The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it is not very good . " <P> Alan Dale : " A theatrical ragout , goulash , or stew . " <P> Heywood Broun : " It is quite evident that the end of the season is approaching . "
