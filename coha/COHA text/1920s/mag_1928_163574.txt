Steam shovels began pecking at Chicago soil last week on the spot where the La Framboise family traded with Indians nearly a century ago . The conservative Chicago Daily News , household necessity for 440,000 people , had ordered for itself a new house of steel and Indiana limestone . It will rise 25 stories along the west bank of the Chicago River-a neighbor of the new Union Station . It will have a public plaza on which fountains will play and perhaps a few trees will grow . Under the plaza and one corner of the building will run the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul . But railroad service will not be interrupted during construction of the News ' house . Holabird &; Roche are the architects . Cost is estimated at $8,000,000 . Upper stories will be rented as offices . <P> Two years ago , after the death of famed Editor Victor F. Lawson , the News was bought by Walter A. Strong and a group of Chicago businessmen . The new house will contain a Lawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawson residence on Lake Shore Drive .
