There are Pundits and pundits . A capitalized Pundit is a member of a queer , recondite , fraternal clique , annually replenished from among Yale students by famed Academic Tycoon William Lyon Phelps . <P> Pundits wear on their watch chains a little god-suspected by the envious of being tin . Harder to define are uncapitalized , courtesy-title pundits . Gene Tunney might be considered one , partly because queer ( as a prize-fighter ) , partly because friended by William Lyon Phelps . <P> Last week sport writers were ecstatically delighted when Mr. Tunney announced that next August he will go on a European walking tour with a famed , Yale-graduated god-wearing Pundit : Novelist Thornton Niven Wilder , author of the best selling Bridge of San Luis Rey . <P> Pundit Wilder explained last week , in the small cozy room which he occupies as an instructor at Lawrenceville School , Lawrenceville , N. J. <P> " I admire Mr. Tunney very much . I met him in Florida , last winter . Our acquaintance grew from talking about books . . . . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . But I sha n't attempt to teach Mr. Tunney anything . ... I shall rent Henry James 's house at Rye , in the South of England if I can . . . . Mr. Tunney will join me there after his bout with Tom Heeney on July 26 . " <P> Intimates of Pundit Wilder suspect that his interest in " bigness , " in " potency , " may have drawn him to pundit Tunney . The novelist is said to have confessed that he finds the pugilist almost without a sense of humor , but interestingly athirst and groping . <P> In the Cabala , Mr. Wilder 's first novel , he was concerned with potent , polished , punditical aristocrats and churchmen in Rome . Significantly he said last week that he does not " dare " to write a novel with a U. S. background , " not at least until I feel sure of myself . " <P> What , queried observers , could be more assuring , more 100% U. S. , than the broad background of Gene Tunney ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a late Junior year arrival . His habit of asking classmates and professors soul probing questions qualified him as a Pundit . It was so obvious that he asked and asked for the simple , Punditical reason that he wanted to know-for example-such things as how the football captain got a certain , curious nickname . <P> After his own fashion Novelist Wilder used to grope . Today he grasps , selects , polishes exquisitely and sets before his readers a literary fare which choosiest critics approve-a fare which pundit Tunney has declared to be in his opinion , inferior only to Eugene O'Neill and Shakespeare .
