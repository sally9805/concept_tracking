While the Argentines were coming to top form in Westbury , and while the Americans who were later to nose them out in a one goal victory were bickering on club piazzas about who should be on the team , some excited women played polo at the Westchester Biltmore . Canadian women and U. S. ones , they were getting ready to play the first match in an international series ; after the second match the team that had scored the greatest total number of goals would be declared the winner . The U. S. women won the first match by a score of 5-2 . Many spectators started to watch them but a cold wind blew most of them away ; only a handful remained at the end to watch Dorothy Hunt-Hogan , the Canadian No. 1 , topple off her pony and clamber back on again to finish the match . <P> Violet May , at No. 3 , played better polo than the other Canadians ; rode better and handled her stick almost as well as the Prince of Wales does . Mrs. James Hewlett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. goals and played better than anyone else in the match . Neither of the Lanier girls , Sally &; Becky , scored against Canada . <P> This was remarkable because Sally Lanier and her sister were playing the forward positions . They are both splendid horsewomen ; Sally , despite the fact that it was only a few years ago that she left Rosemary Hall , is experienced in polo while her sister , more nearly a novice , was the more eager to display her speed &; brilliance . Charles B. Lanier , their father , the son of Poet Sidney Lanier , is the Secretary and Treasurer of the Review of Reviews ; the Laniers live in Greenwich , Conn . The Lanier girls began to ride horses as soon as they could walk ; pictures of them jumping at the Stamford Show , standing beside their ponies at Westchester , watching the hunters at Piping Rock , began many years ago to appear in Rider and Driver , Town and Country , and the chatter supplements of Manhattan newsrags . Sally , two years younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when organized polo for women was an absurd novelty . Becky started to play two years ago ; both are aware that women can never be as good at the game as men but that does n't prevent them from getting enormously excited about it . <P> The thing that polo demands most of all , of course , is strength . Women can handle their ponies as well but they can not ever hope to get the distance that even mediocre male players expect . In golf , 50 yards on a drive can be cancelled by five feet on the green ; not so in polo . Yet , there have been great women players . Mrs. Thomas Hitchcock , who must now be nearly 65 , taught Winston Guest , as well as her own sons , the game ; it would be difficult to say on how many summer mornings this superb lady has been seen on her field in Westbury , telling a crowd of youngsters what was wrong with their play . That field has been the nursery and Mrs. Hitchcock the nurse of International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
