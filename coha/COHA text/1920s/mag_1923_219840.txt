Lieutenants John A. Macready and Oakley Kelly finished the first cross-continental non-stop flight in the history of aviation , landing at Rockwell Field , San Diego , after flying 26 hours and 50 minutes and covering approximately 2,600 miles from their point of departure at Roosevelt Field , Long Island . <P> During the first hour of flight their battery regulator gave trouble and only the hardest work enabled them to make it function . The excessive gasoline load carried forced them to fly dangerously low , 400 feet above the ground during the earlier stages of their trip . <P> A whole night ( between Indianapolis and Tucumcari gravestones in New Mexico ) they flew with a compass as their sole guide . Crossing Arizona in the morning and flying low to get their bearings anew , they piloted their Fokker T-2 in a country of forests , ravines and canyons , treacherous air currents , and at one point flew most dangerously between the walls of a deep canyon . Yet they pronounced their flight " humdrum , " and landed in perfect condition-except for hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Country-wide interest was aroused . The machine was awaited all along its route through Dayton , Indianapolis , St. Louis , Kansas City , Tecumcari , N. M. , and Wickenburg , Ariz . A hundred thousand people met them at San Diego , and telegrams of congratulation by the hundred , beginning with one from the President , poured in from every state in the Union . <P> Significance <P> Macready and Kelly will now attempt to fly around the globe . Lieut . R. L. Maugham , will pilot the Curtiss Army plane-speed record of 245 miles per hour-across the continent in a daylight flight . But more solid significance is attached to the coast-to-coast flight than introduction to further records . It means a tremendous boost for the Air Mail plan of continuous service between New York and San Francisco . It points to the entire feasibility of commercial air lines across the continent . Ultimately no business house will be able to afford any mail but air mail ; no business man any travel but air travel . <P> At Le Bourget , France , Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude of well over five miles-world 's record .
