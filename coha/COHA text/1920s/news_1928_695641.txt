txt If Governor BREWSTER of Maine gave the other Governors in their meeting at New Orleans the impression that Mr. HOOvtat had endorsed in detail the plan to establish a reserve fund of $3,000,000,000 to be used in times of unemployment , he probably went too far . The telegram which Mr. Hooves sent can scarcely have ? been intended ? to indicate more Ulan approval of bringing the general subject up for discussion . It is no novelty . The main idea has been put forward many times during the past eight or ten years . It has been favored by several economists and business men and public officials whose opinions are entitled to respect . It was one of the suggestions under debate by the Conference on Unemployment summoned by Presi ( lent HARDING in 1921 . To the report o its proceedings Mr. Hoov-ER himwrote an introduction , in which said : The committee has . developed roi.nc constructive . suggestions as to the deferment of public work and construction work of large public service corporations to periods of depression and unemployment , which . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would tend both by their subtraction from production at the peak of the boom and . addition of production in the valley of depression toward more even progress of business itself . Since then the plan has been widely discussed and a limited amount of action taken . The principle is partly embodied , as Secretary MEI , LON explained , in the program for public building under the Treasury Department . Bills have been introduced in Congress in furtherance of the main idea . The latest one was that of Senator JONES which was read to the Senate on Jan. 11 , 1928 , and was then referred to the Committee on Commerce . Its title sufficiently shows its purpose : " A " Bill to Create a Prosperity Re " serve and to Stabilize Industry and " Employment by the Expansion of " Public Works during Periods of " Unemployment and Industrial De " pression . " It would have carried appropriations of about $150,000,000 . To the underlying theory of such measures attention has been drawn by the economic writings of Messrs . FOSTER and CATCHINGS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road to Plenty . " In England , where the problem of the unemployed has been far more pressing than in this country , the same proposal that the Government spend a great deal of money on public works , in order not only to give employment but to increase the purchasing power of the community so as to stimulate industry , has frequently been made . A recent address by Mr. SEEBOHM ROUNTREE urged the Government to spend $5,000,000 a week in providing wages on useful public works , specifically in order to create " an " other million pounds of consuming " power a week . " Obviously , the process must have its limits . No Government is in possession of a Fortunatus purse out of which money can be taken indefinitely without drying up taxes and crippling business . In addition , there are enormous practical difficulties which , under our political system , . might easily prove insurmountable . Could Congress be got tel Appropriate , say , poopomo simply for ' a reserve fund against ' a possible emergency ? - Would it ' be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . StatOs and cities ? Could politics and favoritism - be . kept out of the allotment of- the money ? If the ' unemployed happened to be . textile ' workers , . could they instantly be , put at , jobs- as steel riveters or road makers ? , ? , These are only samples - of the questions which leap to any mind There may be satisfying answers to them , and to all the others that may be put . The analogy which is urged between the conduct of Government business and private affairs may prove to be sounder and more workable than at first appears . The economic theory of the plan is , within its necessary limits , plausible . But before it is applied even partially it requires the closest kind of study and the most careful weighing of consequences . Any attempt to apply it immediately and universally would quickly show , we fear , that it is such stuff as social ' dreams are made on .               @ @ @ @ @ @
