A delegation of civic patriots from Caltagirone , Sicily , sought the dark , high-ceilinged office of Signor Mussolini in the Palazzo Chigi last week and humbly petitioned that he would deign to raise their region to the rank of a province . . . . <P> At the request Il Duce frowned . Frowned also the perpetually lowering busts of the chief Roman Emperors which stand on pedestals about the new Caesar 's office . The citizens of Caltagirone shuffled uneasily , prepared to bow and scuttle out . <P> Suddenly the brow of Signor Mussolini relaxed . Rising he cried : " Citizens , I shall create no new provinces until 1932 . But do not despair ! . . . When that time comes , I shall reward those regions which have shown themselves the most laborious , best disciplined and most prolific . . . . Citizens ! Return to Caltagirone and achieve these three glorious goals . . . . "
