When golfers from other countries go to play golf in England they know that though the English players may be bad the English weather will be bad too . It Was particularly unpleasant at Hunstanton , England , where the British women 's tournament was played last week . Followed by several thousand people a pair of pretty girls began the tournament by driving into a wind that swept in full of rain from the cold North Sea . <P> Both girls were thinly dressed , showing that they were foreigners . One was Glenna Collett , the other Mlle. Simone Thion de la Chaume who won the tournament last year . They were the two most interesting personalities in the tournament and the people of England wanted to see them play . What was a little rain ? It would be good for the greens , the cheery faces of the Britishers seemed to say . Mlle. Thion de la Chaume shivered , hooked her drives into the long tough grass , Miss Collett shivered , took a nine in one hole , but tied the match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were several Americans left now and one more Frenchwoman-Mlle . Manette Le Blan . Miss Collett got to the fourth round where she played a tired little woman by the name of Wragg who came out on the first tee wearing hornrimmed spectacles , a leather jacket with a sweater under it , woolen stockings , thick shoes , and woolen gloves . Miss Collett , always natty , had on a thin blue raincoat . Warm and ugly , Miss Wragg kept her ball in the middle of the course . Miss Collett stopped before each shot to warm her fingers with her breath . " How do you feel ? " asked a friend . " Rotten " answered Miss Collett . Miss Wragg put her out , 3 and 2 . <P> Next day Mrs. Dorothy Campbell Hurd , the last U. S. player , was beaten by an Englishwoman named Fowler who was beaten by one named Marshall who then played Mlle. Le Blan in the finals . There was rain again and the cold sea wind harried the dunes . The big gallery scared both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blan has a flashing eye , a hook nose , a big mouth , and a strong , graceful body . She wore stockings , leather coat , woolen gloves , like Miss Wragg . Since she felt comfortable her drives were long and hard , her putts accurate . She beat Miss Marshall at the 34th hole . " I am glad " said she " to have saved the championship for France . . . . "
