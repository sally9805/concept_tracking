txt Timely Letters to the Editor From Readers of the Times on Topics in the News CONFLICTING POLITICAL ISSUES LEAVE EARNEST SOUL GASPING He Pleads for Professorial Counsel Regarding Hoover , Debt Cancellation and Other Important Items To the Editor of ' I he Ncw York Times : Help ! Help ! Save me ere I sink and drown in the sea of political issues ! Issues so ponderous and conflicting , yet vouched for by such eminent political philosophers , that I , like undoubtedly millions of my fellow-citizens , view with trepidation and fear these great political tidal waves of prohibition , religion , oil , and . last but not least , foreign debt revision and cancellation . Will not some political philosopher kindly arise and advise regarding the candidacy of Hoover for the Republican nomination for President , especially analyzing his fitness for that great office because of his attitude and vote upon the foreign debt question when a member of the Foreign Debt Commission ? I should like to vote for Mr. Hoover but am filled with conflicting emotions because of the adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts . As to Cancellations . Incidentally , permit me to call attention to that issue by referring to the report of the World War Foreign Debt Commission issued by the Treasury Department June 6 , 1927 . This report shows that the cancellation of the original debts of the Continental nations , in the aggregate , is 53 per cent. , running from 19.3 per cent . in the case of Finland to 75.4 per cent . in the case of Italy . The settlement with France ( as yet unratified ) , calls for a cancellation of 52.8 per cent .. and the Belgian settlement shows a cancellation of 53.5 per cent . The settlement with Great Britain shows a cancellation of 19.7 per cent . When the settlements with the Continental countries are combined with Great Britain the entire cancellation amounts to 37.8 per cent . when extended over a period of sixtytwo years . The findings of the commission were approved and ratified by Congress . But , and here arises my dilemma , this settlement was denounced and disapproved by two of our leading college presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can I and millions of other supporters and admirers of Mr. Hoover endorse his candidacy when such eminent intellectual giants disapprove ? On Dec. 20 , 1926 , President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia College . Supported by forty-two of his professors , solemnly promulgated an edict that this settlement of the World War debts was all wrong , and I was an act of oppression against our ! allies in the war . This appeal to thei American public and its patriotic taxpayers was profound and emphatic , and was immediately followed by a similar appeal of President Hibben of Princeton University and 116 professors of that institution , who solemnly groaned " Amen ! " With impressive solemnity these great teachers of economics , finance , business , law , history , political science and numerous other great subjects said : " Can any thoughtful American view with indifference the growing odium with which his country is coming to be regarded by our European associates ? " And then they followed this with a soothing bit of comfort to the overburdened American taxpayer , " all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most American taxpayers , ' which , nevertheless , " mean to the overtaxed debtors a crushing burden .

It should be incumbent upon some one of this great aggregation of political wisdom to enlighten those who are sorely perplexed as to what course to pursue regarding the Hoover candidacy . Unless some of these intellectual leaders of public opinion come to the rescue of perplexed Hooverites , they risk being classed with those politicians described by the poet Dryden as men " who think too little and talk too much . " These professors should find encouragement in the fact that THE TIMES editorially calls attention to the fact that the candidacy of Governor Smith and Mr. Hoover is receiving considerable attention in the news from day to day by " straw votes " in several Eastern colleges , and should come forward with political advice to those who , while they admire Mr. Hoover for his many political virtues , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

BACKWARD BRITISH GUIANA Low Wages and Lack of Modern Sanitation Among Handicaps to Be Overcome As a West Indian , closely related to the ' peoples of British Guiana , I am writing to express appreciation of THE TIMES editorial " Backward British Guiana . " Whatever has been said of British Guiana applies in varying degrees to the British West Indies . the peoples and Governments of which are closely related to those of the " Magnificent Province of Dernarara I British Guiana . " Recent political disturbances in those parts of the British Empire are , to some extent , a repercussion of the stringent imm:g , ration code of the United States , whereby their aspiring young men can not as easily as in the past come to this country to earn a livelihood or to work and proceed to the professions . Since the war . too . these peoples have been clamoring for a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiana leading to the Snell Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry of 1927 , and the present bill before the Imperial Parliament have been watched with interest by all the people of the British Caribbees . It is gratifying to know that these recent political disturbances in British Guiana have elicited from British and West Indian politicians complimentary references to the improved sanitary , educational and economic inditions of the protectorates and possessions of the United States in the Caribbean after thirty years , and that invidious comparisons have been made with the British possessions , to the detriment of more than a century and a half of British rule . Both in British Guiana and in the British West Indies sanitation fs extremely backward ; very few of the colonies know much of modern plumbing ; dysentery , typhoid and infant mortality reap a rich harvest annually , while those who survive suffer from the debilitating effects of malaria , ankylostomiasis and elephantiasis . The Rockefeller Foundation of New York City has during the past fifteen years been doing very commendable work in alleviating hu- man suffering in those parts by maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of the Professdr of Tropical Sanitation of the Imperial College of Agriculture for British Guiana and the West Indies , located in Trinidad . is paid in part by that organization The system of education in British Guiana and the British West Indies is. in a large measure , antiquated and impractical , and training of the masses in industrial arts and scientific agriculture for greater production and better methods of living is unknown . The people . no matter how hardworking they may be , remain poverty-stricken , and the strapping West Indian laborer  --  the type used by General Goethals in the building of the canal  --  get 25 cents a day for ten hours of work in a broiling tropical sun . What would seem to be overlooked by the British  --  successful colonizers and administrators though they have been  --  is that the native of British Guiana and the West Indies is in justice entitled to at least a living wage , and at most to a reasonable share of the wealth he produces .

And the recent debates in the Imperial Parliament over the British Guiana Constitutional Amendment act have brought these matters to the attention of the British public and show there is a section of the British people who believe that the impending legislation will not improve the . sad condition of the native . The Caribbean peoples are fearful that this new addition of power to the British Colonial Office and to British Governors will merely provide a freer field , with no restrictions , for the exploiters and concession hunters . H. HUDSON PHILLIPS . Cheyney , Pa. , March 28 , 1928 . JOKER FOUND IN BIRD BILL Senate bill 1271 proposes the following : " To more effectively meet the obligations of the United States under the migratory bird treaty with Great Britain by lessening the dangers threatening migratory game birds from drainage and other causes , by the acquisition of areas of land and of water to furnish in perpetuity reservations for the adequate protection of such birds , and by providing funas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement , and . for other purposes . ' This proposal is all innocent and unsuspicious enough up to the four last words , " and for other purposes , " and then the great joker . The joker will be found in Section 11. where the Secretary of Agriculture , who figures very largely in the document , may let down the bars of the reservation or refuge and then the area be turned into a shambles , where the hunter may quickly destroy what has possibly taken yeare to bring into existence . Although the operation of this joker is to be confined to 40 per cent . of the entire acreage coming under the proposed act , there is enough latitude permitted in the determining of this factor to create no end of trouble and accompanying difficulty . Another glaring objection is that it opens a door permitting the Federal Government to step into a State and mix in its game administration , something which the State itself can best control . In my own State of Iowa , where happily we have one nf th finest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag limit on ducks is fifteen birds , while the Federal Government permits twenty-five . This interference of the Federal Government with the game of the States would mean additional licenses for the shooting of migratory birds . And what is worse , Sections 15 and 16 provide that the Postmaster General shall collect the moneys represented by these extra licenses , and of the total amount of funds obtained from all the States 40 per cent . would be used in Washington for expenses . Section 21 contains an extraordinary thing , something , it seerns to me , the Supreme Court of the United States would never uphold . It provides that an offender against the act can buy himself off by bargaining with the Secretary of Agriculture , who becomes judge , jury and what not . We sportsmen of the Middle West have a word for the sportsmen of the East , particularly those in the Louisiana section , where apparently the " game hogs " of the country are largely segregated . In that section , wild fowl mass in large numbers in Winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada and Alaska . It will immediately be seen that our Louisiana friends have no special claim upon these . We have a splendid Iowa product on the East coast , a man by the name of Hornaday. who stands out p.s the loyal protector and friend of wild bird life the world over . Until a few years ago sportsmen seemed to listen to this man and work with him . Now they turn a deaf ear to what he proposes . Let me give them a word of ' warning : They are about to kill the goose that laid the golden egg . The 8portsmen of Louisiana and kindred sections had best immediately accept a reduction of 50 per cent . on duck bag limits . Our friends there must understand that the old bag limit days are gone forever . If Washington wishes to help in real migratory bird conservation let it do it , but in an advisory capacity , and not by attempting to run our State departments or seeking to obtain our funds .

Even the shadows playing about the tower of the new building contributed to the beautiful and fantastic effect . Here , then , is another of the many instances of sudden beauty in this amazing city . One would hardly expect to have one 's thoughts stimulated in the direction of Cologne Cathedral . while crossing Park Avenue . But such was my experience .

To the Editor of The New York Time : : : Lieut . Commander Lybrand P. Smith of the Navy Bureau of Engineering has designed a mechanism for utilizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sort of funnel at the end of a pipe drives water up the pipe into a reservoir high on a stern and rock-bound coast . Thence it returns to sea level in the ordinary water-power plant way , driving a regular turbine engine on the trip down . Each funneled pipe forms a separate unit , discharging its water directly into the reservoir , and the number of units employed is limited only by the length of the reservoir on top of the bank . Commenting on this " hydraulic ram " and calling attention to the wave power that goes to waste on our 12,800 miles of coast line , Dr. Edwin E. Slosson , Director of Science Service , estimates that over $12,000.000,000 worth of ? ' potential power " goes to waste every year which , he thinks , this or some other kind of wave-power conservation scheme might , in part at least , save . Like so many other estimates of the work that might be done by the waves , these figures are based on the assumption that waves work twenty-four hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given up almost instantaneously , and the next wave occurs at very irregular , and at times very infrequent. intervals . Waves are mainly wind-driven water . No wind , no waves . The Doctor 's estimate of our " loss " might be divided by 300 ? reduced to $40,000,000 . Again , the predication of any loss at all must be based on the assumption that wave energy can be transformed and made available at a price as low as that reached by the most efficient coal and hydroelectric plants . These transform energy at a total cost of about four-tenths of a cent per horse-power hour . And it has never been shown that any wavepower plant can be operated at so low a figure . If to save $40,000.000 worth of energy the cost of its salvation is $41,000,000 , then nothing has been saved . On the contrary , a net loss of a million has been incurred . The world abounds in gold that can not be recovered for what it is worth . We lose nothing by taking out the most available deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most available sources of energy first . Wind power used indirectly via the waves is not likely to be able to compete with the windmill using the same power directly . A substantial percentage of the West Indian sugar cane crop is still turned into sugar by means of the windmill . True , it is a very uncertain tool  --  due to the fact that the wind bloweth where it listeth , and when it listeth , and as much or as little as it listeth . But the same might be said about any sea-wave motor  --  and for the same reason . JOHN YEARWOOD . Brooklyn , Allarch 27. 1928 , UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES To the Editor of The Nem York Timet The statement of Secretary of Labor Davis gives the impression that only 1,874,050 people are unemployed in the United States at the present time , whereas by his own calculations there are at least 3,370,000 . He says that the number of employes in 1925 was 25,222,742 and in 1928 was 23,348,692 , " leaving a shrinkage between the two periods of 1,874 , - 050 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 1,500,000 unemployed , the usual average at all times , making the present unemployment 3,374 , - 000. according to his own method of reasoning . But that is not accurate either , for Secretary Davie bases his estimate upon a percentage of employes unemployed , but figures on only about 25,000,000 , whereas there are over 40,000,000 workers in industry . The same proportion ( 7.43 per cent. ) am plied to the full number would place the shrinkage at 2,800.000 , or total unemployment now at 4.300,000 . The American Federation of Laboi finds that 18 per cent . of union members are unemployed . At that rate the total unemployment , based upon 40,000,000 workers . would be 7,200 , - 000 . From these various calculations it is evident that the current estimate of 3,500,000 to 5,000,000 is more nearly correct than the figures of the Department of Labor . WILLIAM FLOYD .

DANGER TO IMPERIAL VALLEY VIEWED AS A VERY REAL ONE All That Keeps Colorado River From Inundating Rich Depression Is a Levee Which Needs Constant Care To thc Editor of The New York Tints The letter of C. W. French in THE TIMES of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , California , is a curious compound of facts and assumptions presented in a way that would seriously mislead those unfamiliar with the terrain . It would be tedious to answer Mr. French 's letter in detail , but a statement of the flood problem of the lower Colorado River as it affects Imperial Valley may be - helpful . Imperial Valley is the name given to a depression that lies north of the delta of the Colorado River . It contains more than a million acres of the finest agricultural land in America , about one-third of it in Mexico and the remainder in California . As the lowest point in the United States is in this valley , 278 feet below sea level , the absurdity of Mr. French 's statement that the " Imperial Valley is not a valley at all ; it is the summit of a hill " is at once apparent . The whole valley lies below the flood level of the river . and all of it north of the international boundary line lies below sea level . Levee Holds River . It is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing around a portion of its rim . During floods , when the discharge of the Colorado sometimes equals that over Niagara Falls , the only barrier preventing the river from tumbling off the rim into the bottom of the saucer is a rock-faced earth embankment . This levee must constantly be raised and strengthened to meet the changing conditions caused by the river 's erratic meanderings over its delta . That the security afforded by these levees is not very great has been sufficiently demonstrated by numerous failures in recent years . Mr. French gives the impression that no great harm would result if the levee did fail , and he says that " if the river turned in there /Imperial Valley again . and ran there for twenty years , there would not be any flood in the valley . " He arrives at this amazing conclusion from a perversion of the facts regarding the inflow of the river twenty-three years ago . In 1905 a flood flow of the river caused a widening of a temporary intake channel , which finally resulted in turning the entire river into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach was successfully closed , and the river once more returned to its course to the Gulf . This inflow caused the inundation and permanent destruction of 300,000 acres of agricultural land and left the Salon Sea in the north end of the valley , a lake forty miles long and ten miles wide , which stands there today as a reminder of the threat which hangs over the valley . Much Land Under Water . During that flood forty miles of the north end of the valley and the entire agricultural area below the international boundary were under water , and the town of Calexico , in California , was eaved from submergence by the construction of a temporary dike around its borders . The flood flow was finally concentrated in a shallow overflow channel known as New River , and flowed north along . this channel to the low point in the valley . The flow into the New River deepened and widened that channel , but this process did not occur as a gradual erosion as Mr. French states . It was due to a recession such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession caused the destruction of a portion of the towns of Mexicali and Calexico and the complete destruction Iof a strip of agricultural land 1,000 feet wide and forty-three miles long . Should inflow occur again the nature of the damage would be threefold : . First , agricultural lands in the path of the flood would be inundated . This might be confined to Mexican lands , but a serious flood would certainly submerge lands in California too . Second , some of the main canals of the irrigation system would b , destroyed and result in the destruction of crops deprived of irrigation water : Third , the level of Salton Sea would . rise and , if the flood continued long enough , would inundate the entire valley . The peculiar danger to Imperial Valley is that such inundation would be permanent . Along the Mississippi the flooded areas can be reclaimed immediately after the passing of the flood . But in Imperial Valley , because the entire valley ( on the California side ) is below sea level , the flood waters can not run off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . Menace Grows Yearly . It is perhaps necessary to explain that the menace of a flood from the Colorado River grows yearly more serious by reason of the continual elevation of the river bed by the enormous silt deposits transported by the river to the delta . The go deposits amount to 110,000 acre-feet each year , enough to cover the whole of Manhattan Island eight feet deep . The effect is to block the river 's channels to the Gulf , so that today the river has no direct , open channel to the sea . Since 1905 five major changes in the position of the river channel have occurred , and as the slope to the north into Imperial Valley is five times as great as that to the Gulf the river has a tendency to abandon tts course to the Gulf and flow north Into the valley . The flood protection works incidental to the irrigation development of the valley begun in 1906 have increased the tendency of the river to flow to the north by confining the deposition of the silt to the relatively small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily each year , resulting in constantly greater flood heights , which necessitate building the levees higher and higher , until the limit of safety is reached . How long the present levees can safeguard the valley is conjectural . But as there is no controversy among engineers , as there is on the Mississippi , as to whether protection shall be provided by levees or by dams in the upper canyons of the river  --  it is universally agreed that some form of dam should be built  --  the recommendations of the Reclamation Bureau to build a large dam at Boulder Canyon , which is before Congress in the form of the Swing-Johnson bill , should receive immediate consideration .

GREEK CALLED MOST PRECISE Discussion of Languages Brings Out Defects of Many Of the Modern Tongues The letters of Glenn Kelly , Miss Sheridan and Stephen G. Rich reminded me of one of Aesop and made me laugh . I do not know who of the three deserves the crown , but all of them little differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each of them is trying to win for himself is too large for the hole of escape and whoever gets it will sure1 ly be caught . I There has not yet been created a single language which could be said to be precise in every way . Grammarians and philologists tell us that . And the Frenali and English are no exceptions to this rule . ' We can readily notice hundreds of imperfections in either language . In the French language , as Mr. Rich , points out , the grammatical gender is altogether illogical . Nor are prepositions arbitrarily and precisely used . The consonants seem to be employed only for ornamental purposes . On the other hand , the English language has its own imperfections . Because of its hasty accumulation of words . it naturally compares with a modern American skyscraper . Both are great structures . Both are the symbols of utilitarianism , which is the fundamental tuning string of the Anglo-Saxon mind . Both are ably made for service . ' And they do serve . But take service out of consideration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack symmetry , dynamics , precision and all the other principles of estheticism . The use of the article in the English language is very poor . Verbs and nouns are found in the same form . For example , the noun " bear " ( I mean the animal ) and the verb to " bear , " the noun " tear " and the verb to " tear " are only two of the numerable instances which one could marshal to illustrate his argument on this particular point . Take the loose meaning of the following sentence , which happily happens to be the title of a phonographic record , and see if you do not get two different meanings . This is how it is printed on the record : " I told them all about you . " By means of a comma , two different meanings can be given to this sentence . ( 1 ) " I told them , all about you , " and ( 2 ) " I told them all , about you . " I could talk indefinitely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my purpose I consider the paradigms given as sufficient . What I wish to inform Mr. Kelly , Miss Sheridan and Mr. Rich is that , comparatively speaking , the Greek is the most perfect of languages . The French language may be much more euphoneous than the English and the English language may be richer than the French . The German may be one of the . few languages greatly depending on the principle of " sui generis . " The Italian language may establish its rights on the law of primogeniture ? and claim that it is to the Italians the heirloom of Rome . Arguments may be raised in favor of all or any of the above languages , but authorities seem to be unanimous in favor of the Greek language . The Greek , and not the French , English , German or any other language , is the most precise , most euphoneous and most beautiful language in the world .

PORTO RICO 'S NEEDS I note in THE Times two articles relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amount of ! advice which I consider unnecessary due to its impracticability . When one of the writers , Mr. Marcus , discusses the problem of birth control I think he has hit the target , for therein lies the chief source of the island 's misfortunes . I resent that part of his letter where he tells about the Porto Rican laborers telling him that upon receiving national independence they would eliminate the Spaniards with their machetes . That is ridiculous . We have no grudge against the Spaniards at this time . Maybe thirty years ago this statement could have been true . That part of both letters which refers to industrial development of the island shows misunderstanding . It has always been a practice to suggest and plan . In this case all that ! has been suggested along the industrial development lines is impractical . for the following reasons : Porto Rico has no protective tariff . Under theze conditions , should we engage in various industries , we would have tei compete with Amerinan goods which have a free entrance in the island and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary raw material for industrialization . We have no discovered mines , very few forests , not enough pasture to permit cattle raising . and we have many other handicaps . We have failed in many attempts to industrialize the country . For instance , we tried shoe manufacturing for home consumption and failed . It happened that tariff-free American shoes of the same quality were being sold at a much lower price , and , while patriotism may be all right , it generally fails when it is felt in the pocket . The records will show many other similar failures . Porto Rico is largely agricultural and as such could prosper if there existed fair commercial laws and good and strongabirth-control regulations . At present . independence is secondary . JOSE F. ARROYO .

COURTESY NEEDED Possibility of Offense to Mexico Seen in Border Ruling . To the Editor of The New York Tintur In reference to the Administration plan of increasing the , border patrol and tightening admittance regulations for Mexican immigrants , as a means of decreasing the number of Mexican laborers entering this country and attaining the ends of the Box bill without offending Mexico , will not its success depend on the tact- and politeness of immigration officers ? The Mexican Government lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest courtesy and a minimum of bother and annoyance . Therefore it seems a poor answer to the consideration across the line for our immigration people to handle immigrants as there has been complaint of their doing in the past . There are no people who appreciate politeness and consideration more than the Mexicans , and by putting on a lot of hard-boiled immigration officers our recent efforts for friendly cooperation and better understanding can easily be nullified . Both President Calles and ex-President Obregon are very sensitive on the matter of Mexican immigration restriction When it carries any hint of considering Mexicans as undesirables . But both are opposed to their countrymen leaving home , and they as well as Mexican labor organizations are discouraging the emigration of their laborers . Travelers in Mexico say business conditions are slowly improving . No doubt the large Mexican immigration will drop when the Mexicans can better make a living at home . G. H. WILSON .

" The Chinese have found out how true these words are , for they have been compelled , out of necessity , to give up old customs , ancestral homes and dogmatic religious doctrines and go as pioneers into almost unknown and certainly a wild country , where they have cleared lands , constructed homes , built roads and commenced a new life entirely different from the one they have recently left . They could not find the old country conducive for a radical change . Everything they have learned and ' clung to for at least twenty centuries was discarded . The need of food , breathing space and means of a livelihood has brought on a change of mind that has given birth to new ideas and an entirely new outlook . How extensive this emigration is can be discerned fr in authoritative estimates supplied by the South Manchuria Railroad , which is owned , by the way , by the Japanese , although a good percentage of its personnel consists of Chinese .

LETTER FROM THOMAS HOOD TELLS OF HUMORIST 'S ILLNESS I have recently acquired an autograph letter of Thomas Hood which seems to me to be of unusual literary and human interest . Thomas Hood is probably best known to most of his readers as a humorist , and , more particularly , as the writer of " The Song of the Shirt . " By consulting any . biography or book of reference , one finds that , like so many professional " funny men , " Hood led a tragic life . Unable ever to gather much money , and still less able to save it for any length of time , he spent the later part of his life in a state bordering on actual poverty . Added to his fine , ncial straits. , Hood had to bear during many years the strain of severe illness .

ALAN DEVOE . New Yolk , March 26 , 1928 . REMARKS ON EVOLUTION Crossroads Philosopher Enlightens His Spouse on the Beginnings of Things As I pushed my chair back from the supper table last night , after downing a second helping of apple pie , my good wife , sez : What 's there to that story ; which appeared in Sunday 's Tim Es recently , on how chemists might create primitive protoplasms in laboratories ? Do you think it possible ! Now sweetheart , sez I ( 1 always talk like that after a good meal ) , that was one of them dream stories and undoubtedly used , like some of my yarns , to fill up a page . However , guess good old evolution will carry on a bit longer in the same old way , notwithstanding the activities of chemists . And while on the subject of evolution , sez I. do you realize how radio and car instalment payments , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the general activities of na-ture ? In the first place , do n't forget , sez I , that so far as we now know , everything on the earth today has arisen from some preceding form of life . And remember it . We will take , for instance , your favorite flowers in the bay-window here . All of them plants sprung from one original flower  --  the Eve being the humble little buttercup . Evolution caused flowers to adjust themselves for diverse roles in life and existence during different environments . Sweetheart . sez I. as you sit on the front porch gently rocking and trying to think up some excuse to motor to town , do n't you ever wonder on the evolution and growth of them big maples out front ? Why , they are almost as human as some hired men . They digest food and have a circulation system that is just as real as our own . And consider the animals also , honey , sez I.

Now you 've said it , sez I , wii , them chemists and city slicker somewhere in betwixt , by heck . HOMER M. GREEFL Middletown , N. Y. , March 27 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nt le York Titer , ? I have had my attention called recently to two newspaper items describing the occurrence in a Brooklyn court where twenty-three mental patients on one occasion and twentyfive on another were herded into the court room like so many cattle and formal commitment proceedings carried out . In reading these items one would feel he had suddenly taken a trip back to the Middle Ages , when such occurrences , of course , were the rule . We hardly expect to hear of such things taking place in this enlightened age . From information I have been able to gather , such episodes are rather common occurrences in the Brooklyn courts . There has been a long struggle on the part of the medical profession to change the popular attitude to ward the question of mental disease , and to get intelligent people to see that a person suffering from a mental sickness is n't necessarily a scourge and a disgrace to the community and family , but that such an individual is really a human being possessing probably even more acutely many of the sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . The removal of the stigma attached to the question of mental disease has been a slow and gradual process and has been gained only after years of effort on the part of those who have been most interested in combating the causes of our mentally sick people . It takes only a few episodes such as occurred in the Brooklyn courts to undo years of effort . When mental patients are herded into a court room , treated like common criminals . with no respect at all for their rights or for their conc , kkion. the work of many years is partially undone . Such episodes only serve to fasten again in the minds of lay peo- ple that after all mental disease is disgrace and only confirms . a cert philosophy existing among a goo many people which is expressed the assumption , " Oh , he 's just nut ; it does n't make much cliffs once what you do to him . " Su philosophy forgets entirely the . f ?  - -  that a person suffering from m sickness is a human being and h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been eto provide . An episode such as 7 scribed in the Brooklyn court Is fundamental violation of the of a human being and is somethin which should arouse the protest . every one who is concerned with th bettering of conditions surroundin our mental patients . Most of our States , including r7L York , have adopted commitment prt ceedings which are designed to away with just the very thing . wh ' happened in Brooklyn . It is no lc necessary to subject any Mental tient to the humiliation of appearin in a court room in order that fan commitment may be carried Such proceedings can be taken e- - of in the pricy of the . hosPit offices . In view of such enlightene legislation , why is it ' that the- cc community allows such . an unintellige. and inhuman Procedure as that scribed in the Brooklyn court ? FREDERICIC H. ALLEN , M. D.
