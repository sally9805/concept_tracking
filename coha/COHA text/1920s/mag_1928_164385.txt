Fretful , impatient , three Germans paced the Baldonnel Airdrome at Dublin , Ireland . Their plane was poised for flight , pointed westward , over the broad expanse of the Atlantic Ocean , toward America . Anxious , disappointed , obviously annoyed at delays , they waited for favorable weather reports , for they meant to be the first to fly successfully from the Old World to the New . <P> Some days previously , without a word even to their kin , the three had flown to Ireland from Berlin 's great centre of aeronautics , Tempelhof . Thermos bottles filled with coffee and a loaded revolver formed their only baggage . . . . " We land on Mitchell Field or heaven . " <P> Be there a cautious transatlantic flier , then his name is Capt . Hermann Koehl , pilot of this German expedition . In this same ship , the Bremen , he started for America late last summer , got over Ireland , found the hazards impossible to negotiate , and turned back home to try again some happier day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War , shot down twice by the French , taken prisoner the second time only to escape from a prison camp and make a tortuous way back to Germany . He is 40 , married but childless , is old for a pilot . " Blind flying , " night flying so essential to a transatlantic pilot , is his specialty . <P> Baron Ehrenfried Gunther von Huenefeld , monocled Prussian aristocrat , is the backer and passenger of the flight . Seriously wounded in the War , he was invalided out of service and sent to Holland in the German consular service . A close friend of the former Crown Prince , he shared the first days of his dreary exile . He is 36 , married , superstitious . <P> Arthur Spindler , a mechanic , no longer young , was Capt . Koehl 's sergeant during the War and worships the air his master flies in . <P> The Bremen , a silver flash in the air , is a low-winged , single-motored Junkers machine similar to those used in passenger and freight service on the Lufthansa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best at a speed of 95 to 100 miles an hour .
