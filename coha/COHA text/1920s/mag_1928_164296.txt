He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write music if I lived in the country all the time . " ( aged 8 . ) <P> " The Midsummer-Night 's Dream actually put me in a dream in which I saw Oberon , Titania and the fairies . I heard a lot of pizzicat in the Scheherazade . The first and middle part made me think of caramel sauce , thick and gummy ! " ( aged 11 . ) <P> " I could see white horses riding on clouds and fire all around them .
