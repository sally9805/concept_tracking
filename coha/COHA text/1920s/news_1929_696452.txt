txt That the Jones law , passed to mid new and sharper teeth to the Volstead act , 1s euperiluous in that it duplicates existing penalties , and is , therefore unconstitutional is the thesis Attorney Bernard Kelly will present to Federal Judge Woodward Tuesday morning in one Of the first tests of the law 's constlfutinnnlihr Mr. Kelly will appear in behalf of Ira Goldman . former druggist at 6460 Stony Island avenue , who is now serving one year in the Kane county . Jail at Geneva after pleading guilty to selling liquor . The proceedings were brought in the form of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus risking Goldman 's release on the grounds that the law under which he was sentenced is not valid . Says Congress Passed Buck . In discussing the test case yesterday , Kelly characterized the Jones act as " the law with the stump speech in its anatomy , " because in it congress passed the buck to the enforcement agents . " Read the law , " he said , " and you will find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Those persons may be fined not to exceed $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years in a federal penitentiary , provided that it is the intent of congress that the court in Imposing sentence hereunder shall titscriminate between casual or slight violations and national sale of intoxicating liquor or attempts to commercialize violations of the law . ' " How can a man be guilty of a ' slight ' sale ? He can be indicted and sentenced to one year in jail , as was my client , for selling one drink of whisky . Or he could be given all the way from one hour in custody to fiveyears or fined one cent or $10,000 , all under the terms of the Jones law , because it is specifically set forth that the minimum penalties of the old prohibition law shall be Petained in the new law . The old statute read that a man found guilty of selling liquor could be sentenced ' not to exceed six months in jail or fined not to exceed $1,000 but not both . " If the minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cent or one hour , they are superfluous because the minimum has already been provided for in the old act and is only being restated in the new law . Old Law Provided 5 Years . " The first offense , under the old ear rani penalties or not more than six months or ; 1,000 fine , A second offender , under the original act , could be fined not less than $200 nor more than $2,000 and imprisoned not less than one month nor more than five years . It was possible . therefore , before the Jones law was ever thought of , to sentence a second offender for five years for selling a drink of liquor . The imprisonment seems to be regarded as the harshest provision of the new law , " The Jones law applies only to these five violations : sale , transportation , manufacture , importation and cxportation of intoxicating liquor . No mention is made of the ' possession ' count . As a matter of fact , ' possession ' is not mentioned in the eighteenth amendment itself and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked hat also . " Congress knew when it passed the law , " Mr. Kelly concluded , " that five years was too much punishment for selling one drink , but , notwithstanding it gives the courts the power to as mess lust that sentence .
