txt A telephone call was sent for the police to quell a disturbance at the Bedford Branch of the Brooklyn Young Men 's Christian Association yesterday afternoon when the Rev. Dr. S. Parkes Cadman , President of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America , attacked the Reserve Officers Training Corps as ' ' encouraging belief in violence as the final resort in international differences . " The trouble occurred when a group of Army Reserve Officers , who bad obtained advance copies of Dr. , Cadman 's speech , objected to ' certain passages of the address : They attempted to put several questions to the speaker and while truthpeters on the platform drowned out the officers ' protests Halsey Hammond , Executive Secretary of the Bedford Branch of the Y. M. C. A. , telephoned to the police of the Gates Avenue Station , who promptly sent a patrolman to handle the situation . Dr. Cadman spoke on " Disarmament and World Peace , " and while at the outset of hts remarks he declared he was not " an out and out pacifist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Reserve system and the introduction of military training in high , schools , universities and other institutions of /earning. le The officers who objected to Dr. Cadman 's remarks were Colonel Robert Star Allyn , President of the Brooklyn Chapter of the Reserve Officers Association and Commanding Officer of the 607th ( Reserve ) Coast Artillery Regiment ; Lieut . Col. Howard L. Campion . Chairman of the Citizens ' Military Training Camp- Association of Kings County ; Lieutenant James Holton , Secretary of the Brooklyn Chapter of the Reserve Officers Association , and Herman R. La Tourette , Supervising Patriotic Instructor of New York of the Veterans of Foreign Wars All were ejected from the Y. M C. A. by ushers , aided by Patrolman Patrick Carey of the Gates Avenue police station , but as those in charge of the meeting declined to press any charge against them no further action was taken after they reached the sidewalk . There were several hundred persons in the auditorium when Dr. Cadman was introduqed by Mr. Hammond . The Reserve officers occupied seats in the rear and in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handed up to the platform to be answered by Dr. Cadman at the conclusion of his address . Dr. Cadman briefly reviewed the cause , effect and history of some of the great wars and therl launched into his attack on the Introduction of military training in schools and colleges . He said the present system of military training was established by the National Defense act of 1916 and amended in 1920 . Then he continued : " Under its provision army regulations have been issued by the War Department ; manuals have been prepared by army officers and reserve officer . training corps have been established in many civilian educational institutions . Some 1.750 officers and enlisted men now serve as Instructors and commanders in these institutions . Sees War Department Control . " The War Department with the cooperation of the institution concerned is given direct and complete control of // Officers Ejected for Protest . certain parts of our educational institutions and programs . The college or school which accepts the terms of the act in question turns over to an li outside agency the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detailed and specific regulations circumscribe the general authority of the heads of these schools and colleges . The instructors are furnished by the War Department . High schools are required to give three hours per week and five hours per week are required for the third and fourth years in college . Nor can the student who enters upon the course of training be relieved of his obligation except by regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of War . It is a prerequisite for his graduation . While the training is voluntary and the decision in the matter rests with the school or college itself , certain financial and social advantages tend to influence that decision in favor of its acceptance . During the years 1924-1925 reserve officers training corps were maintained in 226 educational institutions . Of this number 121 were colleges or universities . Sixty-three were of high school grade . Thirtynine were essentially military schools . The number of students enlisted was approximately 125,000 . " The avowed design of the curriculum Is not to inje their physical well-being but to make soldiers of them . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . program . Let there be no doubt on this issue . In spite of much talk to the contrary the army regulations are explitit. -1 They declare that the primary object is to provide systematic military training at civil educational , institutions for the purpose of qualifying selected students for appointment as reserve officers in the military forces of the United States . Fears Growth of War Spirit . I ? " Those who support this measure urge that past experience dictates its wisdom ' and necessity ; that the Reserve Officers Training Corps is a substitute for a.ittege standing army ; that the training Makes students better men and better citizens ; that it creates in them an aversion to war ; that it enables-ehern too participate quickly in- orderly Me.sa movements . " Those who oppose it , as I do , con ' tend that it Ingrains in the mental and moral structure of our students the conviction that preparedness for war and war itself are normal relations of nations ; encourages belief in violence as the final resort in international differences and discourages the efforts now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also unconsciously produces in schools and colleges a mental attitude inimical to the ideals of world justice and world peace for which we went into the World War . Nor does our country need . such an extraordinary measure . Iteploys the enormous advantage of man power and economic power beyond calculation . nevertheless , it needs an expansion of its military forces , let this be gained by% other means than this act prescribes . In brief , take the War Department out of the public - schools of the United States and keep it out . " As ' soon as Dr. Cadman finished his address Mr. Hammond rose and and nounced that questions would be answered. , Lieutenant Holton Objects . At this juncture Lieutenant Holton stood up and held up his hand to attract the attention - of the presiding officer . Then Lieutenant Holton said : " This meeting has become political and I have a right to present my side of this question . The doctor ( referring to Dr. Cadman ) failed to mention that there are more than 400 colleges to which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cries of " Boo " and " Put him out ! " on one side and " Speak up ! " " Let him pe heard ! " on the other rose throughout the hall . Mr. Hammond made a motion to the Floria Trumpeters to commence playing and told an assistant to telephone for the police . Lieutenant Holton 's I voice was drowned out by The music and four ushers advanced on him and tried to catch hold of him . The lieutenant was surrounded by the other officers and the ushers desisted in their efforts . At the conclusion of the trumpet music Lieutenant Holton again stood up and commenting on an earlier statement of Dr. Cadman , who had said it was often necessary in-war- I time for a soldier to lie in accordance ' with army propaganda , said , " You have been doing just that thing all afternoon . " Again the cries of " Throw him out ! " rose throughout the hall and Patrolman Carey and the ushers once more advanced toward the officers . This time they caught Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other officers . The Officers and ushers were followed by about two score persons from the hall , while those inside listened to the conclusion of the meeting . None of the ushers nor officials of the Y. M. C. A. wanted to press any charge against the officers , and Dr. Cadman dismissed the incident by saying that it was not in accordance with the accepted procedure of the Sunday meetings . " I think it was good fun , " he said . Colonel Allyn 's Statement . Following the disturbance Colonel Allyn issued a statement in which he said : " Dr. Cadman tan do so much good that it is a crying shame that he should get on the . wrong side of this question , where he can do much harm to this country . He is unfair in attacking our National Defense Policy and at the same time protesting against army officers saying anything in favor of our defense policy in rebuttal . Our present military policy is the result of years of study and experience . I do n't like military training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colleges should accompany certain other courses in ethics and international relations , this to appease those who fear militarism . " But , at the same time , we must not try to hynotizo ourselves into the notion that we can get along without an adequate defense system which must include military training of officers for the reserve . I am surprised that the Y. M. C. A. should advertise as a conference what is merely a propaganda agency , giving no voice to the opposition . It was obvious that Dr. Cadman failed to answer any questions relating to the subject of his address . Stich methods are almost certain to result in protests such as occurred.this afternoon . " Speaks for Defense Act . When the occurrence was reported to the office of the Commanding Geiseral of the Second Corps Area at Governors Island , - Colonef C. A. Trott , speaking in the absence of Major Gen. Charles P. Summerall , who is in Washington , said that the National Defense act of 1920 , referred to by Dr. Cadman , expressed the best and most conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asserted that leading churchmen of other denominations , including Cardinal Hayes and Bishop Manning , have actively supported both the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps and the Citizens ' Military Training Camps , which provide for the commissioning in the reserve of young men who complete the Sulamer courses at the camps . " The act is devised to give us coni-. plete security against the dangers of war , " Colonel Trott said , " to avoid any semblance of militarism or the formation of a military class and to accord with our strong desires for economy . In this act we provide for the smallest regular army which will guarantee our immediate protection and the defense of our foreign posesskins . We provide for a National Guard to give the States a control over our emergency forces . Finally , we provide . for an organized reserve and for a system of training our citizens so that they can enter the reserves ' and be somewhat prepared for their emergency , tasks . The Regular Army and the National Guard constitute our police force . The organized reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posse to support the police during periods of international outlawry.
