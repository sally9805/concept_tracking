The Lord Chief Justice of England , Baron Hewart , heard last week in London the appeal of one Chung Yi-miao , a Chinese law student whom a lower English court had sentenced to hang for murdering his Chinese wife , also a young student . <P> Murderer Chung pleaded his own appeal before the Lord Chief Justice . When judgment was about to be pronounced , Chung Yi-miao leaned forward and cupped his hand behind his ear , in order not to miss a word . <P> Imposing in great wig and majestic robes , Baron Hewart said : " It is impossible to say that there is not ample evidence to find that this appellant committed this crime . Miao is guilty of a diabolical , calculated crime . This appeal is dismissed . " <P> As Murderer Chung Yi-miao was dragged protesting to his cell , meticulous observers noted that the Lord Chief Justice had mistakenly referred to him as " Miao " - apparently supposing that to be his surname . Of course Chinese surnames or " last names " come first , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty , " unless His Lordship desired to refer to the prisoner familiarly by his given name , which was Yi-miao , not Miao.
