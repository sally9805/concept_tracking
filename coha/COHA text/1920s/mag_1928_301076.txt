The Lady of the Orchids . Item : a bedroom at 3:30 a. m . Item : a bed with ermine covers and a plethora of pillows . Item : Peggy Hopkins Joyce in a " creation " better known as a nightgown . Total : a bad French bad bedroom farce . <P> Mima . David Belasco is the grand old man of the U.S. theatre . To prove this , he wears a turn-around collar and permits himself to be photographed frequently with a benign facial expression . Like Flo Ziegfeld , George M. Cohan and certain other producers , he is never publicly designated as ridiculous . For the last few weeks , articles have appeared in news-sheets telling how " the Dean of the American Stage is working day and night , transforming his theatre into a veritable Hades , " how " Belasco 's version of Ferenc Molnar 's Mima costs $300,000 to present , " and lastly how this " lavish production will be Belasco 's swan song . " So a typical Belasco audience , in limousines , came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passionate affection and a huge machine for producing evil on the earth . <P> The machine was the invention of one of the devils ; it contained three cylinders , which , when opened , disclosed a marionette called Mima working her wiles on a simple forester . The diabolical mechanic who had designed this dynamo was displaying its efficiency to a Satanic investigation committee which sat in the orchestra pit to watch . Mima took the forester away from his wife with waggles of her physique ; she made him commit the sins of the calendar and other more intimate ones , as blackmail and pandery . At last , it was the intention of the devil that the forester should show that he had lost even the virtue of mercy by killing Mima for her crimes . The forester refused to do this , restrained by the little grain of goodness that remains in mortals , however debased they may be grown . The devil 's machine , a failure , tottered and crumpled all over the stage and Janos , the forester , escaped through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Interesting and incredible , the play was chiefly remarkable for the stage devices it contained ; stage devices , since the invention of the cinema , are less potent than they used to be to evoke illusions and it was in displaying his unique skill in their construction that Producer Belasco really sang his swan song . <P> His skill in making actors out of individuals like Jack Dempsey or even Lenore Ulric is a less rare but more valuable one . When he watched Lenore Ulric display her manikinetic tricks to Satan 's jury , Producer Belasco must have smiled to himself , for it was he , not " Dr. Magister , " who taught her how to do them . A little girl from Minnesota who had played in stock in Milwaukee , she came to Manhattan and played in The Mark of the Beast . After that , Belasco got her and has had her ever since . Tiger Rose , in 1917 , made her very famous ; in Kiki , one of the Dean 's most profitable ventures , she was a little " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lulu Belle . Never married , her engagement has been reported with discouraging frequency ; she eats lemons between meals to discourage hoarseness but her voice , nonetheless , is the voice of a dulcet raven . Her father was an army hospital steward and Lenore Ulric was born in New Ulm , Minn. , in 1894.
