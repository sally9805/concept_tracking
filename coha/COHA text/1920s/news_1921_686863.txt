txt Perhaps twenty years ago , or even fifteen years ago , some rnethods of business called for reform , and it was easy to jump at the assumption thatNegislation was the way to get it . In , the matter of railroad management it has been shown here that every improvement has come from within , and that state and Federal regulation has done an enormous and demonstrable amount of harm , while it is still a clog upon progress . Industrial regula- , tion , ' where it has confined itself to factory acts , has helped ; but where it has interfered in the management of business by the fixing of prices for commodities , raw material , labor or even rent , it has done and is doing incalculable mischief . Listening to the voice of the agitator , we have attempted by legislation to reform or remold human nature itself , instead of going about it in the old-fashioned way through the old-fashioned teachers  --  the way of persuading human nature to reform itself . But the one thing we should have reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politician . All our efforts that way , especially those aimed at making him more directly servile to the mob , ? like the initiative , referendum and recall , to say nothing of the popular erection of Senators , ? have only resulted in making him a bigger and more dangerous fool . We have been nauseatingly dosed with talks about our " ideals " , but we are slow to face and conquer out wrong ideals and conceptions . We seem to think that it is important a man should be able to talk fluently , attractively and persuasively , but that it is unimportant that he should talk nonsense . Reform is a word which is everlastingly in the politician 's mouth , and the thing itself is the last thing he wants . He is prepared to advocate any dangerous change so long as he has satisfied himself that it is not a reform . Just as contented workmen would put the labor leaders out of business ; so a contented , prosperous and industrious people would scrap most of theboliticians . Congress is already too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each census . With 430 members now , it proposes to raise the number to 460. where its efficiency would be doubled with 230 ; where it would do twice the real work in half the time . Popular election of Senators has had the inevitable effect of deteriorating the quality of the Senate  --  a fact which the frarnes of the Constitution , more truly republican than oursz:ve3. easily foresaw . With few exceptions , the state legislatures elected better men than we have now . Politicians are responsible for many-conditiOns falsely ascribed to the war They had destroyed the credit of the railroads years before the war . They are busy with the reform of business , partly through taxing and regulating it to death . But suppose business , all business , the Steel Corporation and the proprietor of the peanut stand , were to start in to regulate the politicians ? Business is growing tired of taxation without representation , and some day something will have to break . Russia 's only contribution to the cause of liberty so far is the abandonment of prohibition .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
