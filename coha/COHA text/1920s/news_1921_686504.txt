txt RIGHT OF SEARCH . State Dry Law a Violation of Constitutional guarantees . To the Editor of The New York Times : Justice Prince and others have expressed doubt as to the constitutionalitY of the new State Prohibition law . Where is the necessity for any doubt ? It makes no difference what the Constitution of this State says , the Constitution of the United States absolutely guarantees that every one in this country shall be considered innocent until he is proved guilty . am accused of murder I can close my mouth and refuse to say a word and It is up to the State to prove my guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or I must be acquitted and go free . No man can be made to prove his innocence of any charge of any kind whatever , and any official who , as most of them have done . has taken a sacred oath to " uphold and maintain the Constitution of the United States , " and who deliberately violates that oath and the Constitution by arresting a man and forcing him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished to the limit of the law . It is not sufficient that the case be dismissed as has happened in a number of cases recently . It is this very defiance of the constitutional rights of the people that has caused anarchy and revolution in many a country in the past . Again , most people seem to bo imbued with the idea that the only case where a search and seizure warrant is needed without violating the Constitution is a person 's house . On the contrary , the Constitution does not put one 's house first , but says that a person shall be inviolate in his person first , his house second , his papers third and his effects fourth . The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution is as explicit as the English language can make it . " Effects " means personal property and includes a man 's suitcase , motor car , yacht or anything else that belongs to ? him , and no official in ' this country has an atom of right to search me for a hip pocket flask , to Inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , that warrant , according to that same amendment , has got to " particularly describe the persons or things to be seized . " A warrant that does not do that i : not worth the paper it is written on and a Judge who signs such a warrant is rendering himself liable to impeachment for violating the Constitution . The words " particularly describe " mean exactly what they say and mean an accurate description of what is to be seized . How many search and seizure warrants have been issued in this city during the last year have carried out the provisions of the Constitution ? Every person who has suffered in consequence of such illegal warrant has a legitimate claim for damages against the city , and could bring impeachment proceedings against the Judge who signed pie warrant . The Constitution is the foundation and bedrock of our freedom and the press can not do a greater service to the people than in forcing an implicit obedience to it on the part of every official , Judge , policeman and prohibition agent . It is playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers in contempt at that Constitution that is the very foundation of all our liberties and freedom . EDWARD WATSON . New York , May 1 , 1921.
