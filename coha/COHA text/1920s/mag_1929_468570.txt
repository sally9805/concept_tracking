WE MEIN/FURS of the English middle-class are accustomed to think that the economic changes produced by the War have hit us pretty badly . And so indeed they have . Income tax stands at four shillings in the pound . When we calculate our burdens and our grievances , that is the burden which seems to us the most grievous of all , although I doubt whether it really is so . What with personal allowances , children 's allowances , and insurance allowances , we actually pay about two shillings sixpence in the pound , which makes a pretty heavy first charge on our incomes . But the real burden is the rise in the cost of living . The Govern ? ment statistician tells us that it is no more than 0 per cent ; but we know that for us it is at least 100 per cent . The Government figure is based on the cost of the essential foodstuffs and the minimum requirements in the way of rent , fuel , and clothing ; but it is in those accessories of life ? luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use has made necessary for us that the real rise has taken place . We ca n't send our children to the State schools Goodness knows what sort of an accent and what sort of habits they would pick up there ? but the fees at the Preparatory Schools and at the great Public Schools have become staggering . Our Club subscriptions are doubled . The suit of clothes that cost me eight guineas before the War now costs me fourteen ; and in my position I simply ca n't afford to go to a cheap tailor . The single whisky and soda which I take before I go to bed costs me twelve shillings sixpence a bottle againstthe four shillings which I used to pay ; my bottle of beer at dinner is seven and a half pence against the old two and a half pence ; and the price of tobacco is an outrage . In the old days when only about one-fifth of the population of these islands ever dreamed of taking a holiday , holidays cost very little : now that prac ? tically the whole population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost is appalling . And worst of all is the habit , ingrained in us since the War , of spend ? ing money with a frequency and reck ? lessness that would have appalled us in those prosperous and care-free days fifteen years ago . Where my father , who lived a life of very considerable comfort and died in 1915 , would have looked twice before spending sixpence , I think nothing of half-a-crown . And the result is that I am overdrawn at the bank at the end of every month ( my father would have considered him ? self eternally disgraced if he had ever been overdrawn at his bank ) ; that I have n't saved a penny ( but then I can took forward to a pension , and my life is fairly well insured ) , and that we wonder how on earth we are ever going to find the money for the children 's education And we shake our heads mournfully and say to each other how happy we should be if we only had five hundred pounds a year more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it is the War that 's responsible for the changes in us no less than for the changes in the cost of things . But I 'm beginning to wonder whether , after all , we really are so badly off as we think . It seems to me that when we 're not actually grumbling about our pov ? erty ? which we do for about five min ? utes a week ? we 're pretty contented , and that on the whole we have good reason to be contented . I may be over ? drawn at the end of the month , but I 'm solvent . If we do spend a lot of money , we get a lot of fun out of it . While we wonder how on earth we 're ever going to educate the children , two of them arc al ? ready at excellent schools ; and I 've no real doubt that when the youngest ( he 's only four ) has to go to school next year , his bills will get paid just as the others ' are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke my pipe , and have my bottle of beer with my dinner and my whisky and soda before I go to bed ; and we go occa ? sionally to a theater or to the pictures , although we grumble at the excessive cost of all these commodities . And I can still afford to read Harper 's , and James Truslow Adams 's article on " The Cost of Prosperity " in. its December number . And it is that article that has set me to wondering whether , after all 's said and done , we are n't at least as well off as our brother and sister members of the middle-class in that paradise of wealth and prosperity , the United States . That article , and other articles and stories which I read from time to time , not only in Harper 's but in other Ameri ? can publications and novels , give me an idea of the sort of life which a man in the professional class ? a part , and an im ? portant part , of what in England we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has occurred to me that American readers may be interested to consider what sort of life members of that class live in England , or at any rate what sort of life one member of it lives ; for I make no claim to speak for anyone but myself and the more intimate of my friends . It 's impossible , I think , to say any ? thing about the quality of a man 's life ? its comfort , its happiness , its content ? ment , or the reverse ? unless you knowsomething of the most important ele ? ment in it , namely his marriage . I notice , looking back on what I 've writ ? ten , that I have used " I " and " we " quite indiscriminately ; and so far as Cynthia and I are concerned , the two pronouns are in fact indistinguishable . We act and react very much as a single individual . That , no doubt , is partly due to an initial similarity of outlook and temperament , and very largely due to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , partly due to the concep ? tion of marriage common to our class and age . One of the things that puzzle me most in the social life of the States , as depicted in magazines and books ? from which alone I derive my knowledge of that life is the American conception of marriage . If we may judge from what we read , the average American husband and , still more , the average American wife does not regard marriage either as essentially permanent or as a completely equal partnership involving on both sides obligations as well as rights . But I do n't believe that that impression can be a true one ; after all , it is the abnormal , especially in such matters as married life , rather than the normal that finds its way into print . In my country and in my class , at any rate , marriage is regarded as a perma ? nency . However much the figures of divorce may be on the increase , divorce is still an accidental and not a calculable incident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either party to a marriage that he or she was doing any ? thing else than enter into a community of interests for the term of their natural lives . if you start out as a matter of course with that idea in your minds , the question of rights and obligations hardly arises . The " obligation " on the hus ? band 's side to earn a sufficient income to provide for his family , and on the wom ? an 's side to spend that income so that it does in fact provide for them , are obliga ? tions not towards each other but to ? wards a common interest equally impor ? tant to both and , therefore , they cease to be felt as obligations . Similarly the " right " of each to receive help , comfort , and affection from the other ceases to be felt as a right ( always an uncomfortable thing to possess ) when it becomes some ? thing like the natural and unquestioning expectation which one has that of course one 's partner in business will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , marriage , in England at any rate , is a very settled state of exist ? ence , something one does not expect will change , unless by imperceptible degrees ; with the result perhaps that the whole of life in the middle-class is in a high degree static and permanent . A man does not expect to change his work any more than he expects to change his wife , nor does he willingly move from one house ? still less from one town ? to an ? other . He hopes to send his son to the same school , and to the same college at the same university as he went to him ? self ; and he confides his not very heavy legal business ? the drafting of his will and of his daughter 's marriage settle ? ment , the drawing up of his lease , and the settlement of his father 's estate ? to the son of the solicitor who performed the same services for his father . We are , in fact , a very conservative tribe . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this digression , you must as ? sume that when I say " I " in this article , I might in most places equally well have written " we . " I am forty-two and have been married fourteen years . We have three children , Mary aged twelve and a half , Dick aged eight , and John aged four . I oc ? cupy a fairly senior and responsible position in the Civil Service , in one of the big Government Departments whose Offices look on to the Cenotaph in White ? hall , and I draw a salary of fourteen hundred pounds per annum . Offering as it does a decent competence , with a good pension at the age of sixty , pleasant and responsible work , with the possibil ? ity of exerting real ( albeit anonymous ) power , and of being behind the scenes of important events and policies , the higher division of the Civil Service presents many attractions to a young man who has done well at Oxford or Cambridge . The aspirant enters , between the ages of twenty-one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competi ? tive examinations in the world ; and , once entered , he is irremovable exeept for gross misconduct , and can look forward to an official career of some forty years spent in not unreasonably strenuous work , in dignified surroundings , and amid colleagues who , having entered by the same strait gate as himself , will cer ? tainly possess considerable intellectual ability and are likely to have an intelli ? gent and informed interest in one or more of the various spheres of artistic , literary , or scholastic culture . In short , the higher division of the Civil Service is one of the inner fortresses of the English middle-class , and displays in an eminent degree nearly all the great qualities and defects of that class ? on the one hand its scrupulous integrity , its innate capacity for the business of government , and its devotion to its job just because it is its job ; and on the other , its smug sense of superiority , its hard-baked conservatism , its some ? what limited sense of humor , and its al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The salary of a man in my rank in the Civil Service before the War was ? 100D ? a very comfortable middle-class income in the circumstances of those days . On such an income a man could be sure of sending his sons , if he had any , to good schools and to Oxford or Cam ? bridge , and of " finishing " his daughters on the Continent ; he could entertain dis ? creetly , and look forward to a comfort ? able old age in which his pension would be supplemented by the income derived from the savings he would bequeath , not unduly depleted by death duties , to his children . The salary of my rank is still ? 1200 , but to it has been added a tem ? porary and fluctuating " cost-of-living bonus " of approximately ? 200 ; and ? 1400 now is very far from being equiva ? lent to ? 1200 before the War . It is when I compare ? 1400 now with ? 1200 then that I begin to grumble at my lot ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began this article , which was to be called " The Plight of the English Middle-Class " and was intended to show how hard hit we were by the War . But like Johnson 's would-be philosopher , find that cheerfulness will keep break ? ing through ; and , if we do n't live as well as perhaps we should have done before the War , we do n't really do so badly . The Office pays my salary into my bank on the last day of every month ? ? 100 in January and February , April and May , July and August , and Octo ? ber and November , and ? 120 in March , June , September , and December , making a total of ? 1280 , the remaining ? 120 being deducted at the source for income tax . As my rent is exactly ? 80 a year , the odd ? 20 in March , June , September , and December goes straight to my land ? lord , and in effect I have ? 100 a month and a rent-free house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a house to ourselves in a very pleasant street in one of the pleasantest quarters of London ; and all our neigh ? bors , for exactly the same sort of house , are paying at least ? 120 . Cynthia found it before the War , and before we were married , dragged me away from my Office to come and look at it , and we took it on the spot . The rent then was ? 60 a year , which was pretty cheap even for those days ; and just as our agreement was expiring , Parliament in a mood of benevolent wisdom passed the Rent Restriction Act , which enabled our land ? lord to raise the rent to ? 80 but pre ? vented him either from turning us out or from raising it any more . When the Act comes to an end I do n't know what will happen ; but if we have to find a new house or to pay what our neighbors pay , our budget will be seriously upset . For our ? 80 a year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a little room that used to be my " study , " but is now Mary 's room ; a really good bedroom for ourselves on the first floor with a dressing room for me behind , and a bathroom ; a big nursery and the maid 's bedroom ( for cook and house-parlormaid ) on the second floor ; and in the basement a kitchen and scul ? lery , and a good sitting room for the maids , and behind it a tiny bit of garden , haunted by cats , but in which we manage to grow a flower or two . This would be well enough for a childless couple , or even for father , mother , and one child ; but when three children and a nursemaid have to be packed in , it 's a bit of a squeeze . The two boys have to sleep in my dressing room , and the nursemaid in the nursery ? not a very desirable arrangement , but the only possible one . Another drawback is the single bath ? room , which means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? when a bath is above all things desirable ? because the bathroom is occupied by a succession of grubby children en route to bed : night and morning is oar time . It a squash : but at any rate the fact that they sleep in my dressing room gives me a chance to get a talk with the boys , both of them in bed , as I dress for dinner , which is the only time of day I ever see them during the week , except for a few minutes at breakfast . And much as we should like two bathrooms and an extra bedroom or two ? not to mention some place where I could set up a carpenter 's bench and the boys could keep their railway permanently on the floor ? our roots , nurtured by fourteen years of happiness and love ? have struck deep into this poky little house , and I 'm not sure that we would leave it if we could . Cynthia and I have always bad a single bank account on which we both draw ; and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial affairs has fallen more and more into her hands . This is partly due to the fact that far more of our expenditure is within her control than within mine , and partly to the fact that on two occasions I have been out of the country on business for considerable periods ? once for nearly two years and once for eight months ? during which time she has had to look after everything ; so that it seemed convenient that she should continue to do so on my return . While we both of us have complete freedom , so far as the Bank is concerned , to draw checks , it is more or less under ? stood between us that Cynthia will not draw more than ? 45 a month during term time ( when the two elder children have their midday meal at school ) and ? 50 during the holidays , and that I shall not draw more than ? 15 a month , leaving ? 35 or ? 40 a month to meet what are known as " the hills . " Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in ? cluding beer , which comes from the grocer , but not whisky or wine , which come from the wine merchant ) , for all household cleaning materials , laundry , and other household necessaries , includ ? ing the replacement of breakages , the servants ' wages ( ? 9 a month among the three of them , with occasional additions for a charwoman and a sewing maid ) , and for all her clothes and the children 's . For her own clothes she has in addition the allowance of ? 40 a year which her father gave her before her marriage and which he still continues to pay . Judging by the children 's health and spirits , both of which are in a high degree robust , they must be pretty well fed , and I do n't suppose that any husband of my acquaintance goes home from his office with a more confident anticipation of a really nice little dinner than I. We have friends to dinner ( four besides ourselves is all our dining room will hold ) once or twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food we give them is excep ? tional , it is at least as well chosen , as well cooked , and as well served as in any house in which we ourselves dine . As for dress , my wife has , I think , a touch ofgenius . Not only is she a first-rate dress designer and maker herself , but she has the gift of inspiring the sewing woman we occasionally employ . We go every year to a Garden Party at the Palace , and to Court once every five years or so ; and at these functions she always seems to be as well dressed as any woman there , though she has never yet spent more than ? 15 on her complete outfit , and only once as much ; and for more or ? dinary occasions she is always more than adequately turned out , even though some of her friends may sometimes recognize an old acquaintance among her frocks in a new reincarnation . My ? 15 a month is intended to meet ? and does more than adequately meet ? all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in life . The fixed expenses are fares , sixpence a day ; lunch , one shilling sixpence a day ; and tobacco , about twelve shillings a week ( including Cynthia 's cigarettes ) . Vari ? ables are hospitality ( it is convenient , and pleasant , to have a man to lunch at the Club two or three times a month ) , clothes ( other than my tailor 's and hab ? erdasher 's bills ? i.e. boots , hats , an occa ? sional overcoat , or a tie or a pair of socks that catch my eye and my fancy ) , our joint fares when we go for a week-end or take a taxi in the evening , an occasional whip-round at the office for a wedding present or something of the kind , gramo ? phone records ( we have a collection of pretty good stuff , which gives us a great deal of pleasure ) , the " pictures " once or twice a month and an occasional theater or music-hall ? in fact , all the hundred and one odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the whole of my ? 15 , often I draw only about ? 10 , and I have been known , when we are very hard up , to get through the month on as little as ? 7 ; but in any case I feel myself at liberty to draw up to the full ? 15 if I want it . The rest is for " the bills " ; and with these we always seem to be panting about a month , and sometimes two and even three months , behind . Only on three glorious occasions have we been able , on the first of the month , to pay off every bill we had in the world ; and then we went such a burst the next month that it took us some time to recover . And , on the other hand , only once have we had outstanding bills amounting to more than ? 100 , and that occasion produced so thick a domestic gloom and so frantic and uncomfortable a spasm of economy , that the bills rapidly got paid off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include everything that does not come within the sphere of Cynthia 's or my monthly allowance . Chief among them , marking the four financial crises of the year , are the terminal school bills ( roughly , ? 25 each for Mary and Dick , and as yet nothing , thank goodness , for John ) , and my birthday , when most of my life-insurance premiums , amounting to about ? 60 , fall due . Like great breakers when one is bathing , they ap ? proach , one is overwhelmed beneath them , and at last emerges , gasping and relieved , on the other side . Twice a year come the rates ( ? 15 or ? 16 every six months ) , every quarter the gas and electric light . and telephone , a running bill , starting again as soon as it is paid off , with the coal merchant , the plumber , and decorator , and the wine merchant , an occasional tailor 's bill of awful dimen ? sions , the dentist and the doctor . But . the doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shall have , a division to himself . I have watched with considerable in ? terest , in the pages of Harper 's and else ? where , the battle in the United States of specialist versus general practitioner . Here in England , notwithstanding a slight tendency to resort direct to the specialist in recent years , the general practitioner , God bless him , still holds his own without apparent difficulty . If we had had to engage a specialist for each of Cynthia 's confinements , we simply could not have afforded to haveany children ; and if for anything wrong out of the ordinary we had to go to a clinic , where neither our circumstances nor our particular physical characteris ? tics are known , we should probably leave it until too late to begin with , and then should get treatment no better , and probably worse , and at far greater ex ? pense , than we get from our family doctor . When we married , Cynthia 's family doctor was giving up his practice , and at his recommendation I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile of our new home . I liked his looks , told him what my income and position were , and asked him to take us on . His first bill was for bringing Mary into the world . It in ? cluded all preliminary visits ( and there were a good many ) , all attendances for a month or so after the confinement , and vaccination , and it amounted to ? M. It was a long and not too easy , but by no means an abnormal confinement ; and at intervals , knowing what hus ? bands feel like on these occasions , espe ? cially when they have not experienced them before , he found time to come downstairs and cheer me up . Both Cynthia and I knew that if he had felt the least necessity for the assistance of a specialist he would not have hesitated to call one in . If we had gone to a special ? ist in the first instance we should not have had half as much pre-natal atten ? tion ; he would not have been as im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in the event of a premature confinement or other emergency , and he would have charged us not less than ? 100 , a sum which we simply did not possess . Since then he has brought both boys into the world , has taken Mary 's tonsils out , and has operated on Dicky for hydrocele . Whenever he has felt that he would like a specialist 's opinion or as ? sistance he has asked for it ; but that has been on three occasions only , twice for Cynthia and once for me , when I had all my insides taken out , refurbished , and put back again minus a few bits . And he has never yet sent us in a half-yearly bill exceeding ? 25 ; it is usually anything from ? 3 to ? 8 . When I had my opera ? tion he arranged with one of the leading abdominal surgeons of London , whose fee , if I had gone to him direct , would have been ? 200 , to do the job for ? 70 . He himself attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after me during recovery ; and in the end sent in a bill , which included John 's birth and my operation , for ? 25 . But the fact that , as a rule , he is amazingly cheap is not the only , or even the greatest , merit of the general practi ? tioner . His real value lies in the knowl ? edge and experience which he possesses of the ordinary man and woman in gen ? eral , and of the individual patient in particular . Our doctor has an intimate acquaintance with all the physical char ? acteristics and idiosyncrasies of my wife , our children , and myself . He knows that if Mary or I has a temperature of one hundred or so , it 's probably nothing to bother about , but that if Cynthia or either of the boys goes up to ninety-nine they must be taken seriously . He knows that because Dick is a bit thin and pale it does n't mean that he 's any less robust than John , who always looks the picture of health even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a sudden fit of sickness , it 's merely a peculiarity left over from my operation . It would never have occurred to him to suggest that Cynthia should go for her confine ? ments to a nursing home , where she would be among strangers and separated from me ; and he had no objection to my being with her up to the very last mo ? ment . And I shall not easily forget his yell , through our bedroom door , of " It 's a boy " when Dick turned up , a yell loud enough to produce cheers from the kitchen , two floors below , where the maids , almost as wrought up as I was myself , were waiting for the news . That 's the sort of comfort you can only get from a family doctor ; you certainly wo n't get it from a gyrnecologist . When I said , a few lines back , that the maids were almost as wrought up over Dick 's birth as I was , I was of course guilty of exaggeration . But our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a part of the family , and they have been tremendously excited and pleased at each new arrival . In this , at least , we of the middle-class in England are very definitely better off than our brothers and sisters in the States ; for we can not only obtain , but also afford , good servants . One hears , it is true , many complaints that good servants are no longer to be had ; but I suspect that most , if not all , such com ? plaints come from bad mistresses . Cyn ? this has always had the trick of making our maids devoted , not only to her per ? sonally , but to our family as a whole I think the secret of it is that she never forgets that they are human beings , and that our home is temporarily their home ; and in return she expects , and gets , just as regular and good service as I expect and get from my clerks and typists . When first we married we had a cook ( wished on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found our ? selves ) . The cook was a bad cook and dirty at that ; but we were young and inexperienced , and we put up with it until , to our joy , she gave Cynthia notice a month or two before Mary 's birth . Then for the first and only time in our lives we went to an employment agency , and got a young cook who turned out to be all that could be de ? sired . Our house-parlormaid was a success from the start ; and when Mary arrived she took on with enthusiasm the added duties of nurse . In due course she left to be married , and then the cook brought in her sister as house-parlor ? maid and her cousin as nurse . From that day forth none of our maids has left us for any other cause than to be married , except two who were unsatis ? factory from the start and were practi ? cally chased out of the house by the others ; and each vacancy as it occurred has been filled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pres ? ent we have a cook aged twenty-three who has been with us three and a half years , a house-parlormaid ( the sister of a friend of the cook 's ) who came six months ago to fill the vacancy caused by the marriage of her predecessor and who shows every sign of being a jewel , and our treasure of a Nanny , who came to us as a child of sixteen , six and a half years ago , and whom we can and do quite happily leave in entire charge of the children if we go away for a week-end . To the cook we pay ? 36 a year , to the parlormaid ? 32 , and to Nanny ? 40 . Closely connected with this blessing of good service is another blessing which , if again one may judge from what one reads , our fellow class-mates in the United States do not enjoy to the same degree as ourselves ; and that is the blessing of privacy . It is a blessing which you can only really get in a big city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own door-step or hang out your own washing in the back garden just as your neighbor next door is doing the same . We do n't even know the names of our next-door neigh ? bors ; and we know only two other fami ? lies living in the same road , and these because we met them elsewhere and liked them and they liked us . In a small town , or in the suburbs that are springing up like mushrooms all round London , you 've got to know your neigh ? bors , and dine with them and have them to dinner with you , whether you like them or whether you do n't ; and as your tastes and interests may be , and prob ? ably are , totally dissimilar , you sink to a level of intercourse based almost en ? tirely on the universal interests of sport and money among the men and clothes and servants among the women . We very greatly enjoy having people to dinner , and we never have to ask anyonewe do n't want to ask . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these occasions is talk ; but as we have interests and pursuits in common we do talk , and it 's very good fun . We go out to dinner , with people like ourselves whom we like , perhaps once a week , and do an occasional evening at the theater or the " pictures " ; and on other nights ? that is to say , on more than half the evenings of our life ? we sit after dinner in the drawing-room , Cynthia with her work and perhaps a game of patience , I with a book or sometimes scribbling something , talking when we want to talk and not otherwise , with an occa ? sional gramophone evening when we feel like it , until my whisky comes in at ten-fifteen and , after the last pipe , we go to bed about eleven o'clock . It sounds devastatingly dull ; but it is n't or at any rate we do n't find it so . And even if in the country one has to know one 's neighbors more than one does in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own . My mother lives in an old house in a village in East Anglia , a place whose population and activities ( all arising out of agriculture ) are about the same now as when Domesday Book , in which it is described , was written . My father bought the house thirty years ago to live in when he should retire , and died before he could enjoy it . My mother usually lends it to us for the summer holidays . There is a garden of about three-quarters of an acre , with a river running past the bottom of it , on which we have a boathouse and a boat , and a good high wall all the way round ; and it 's surprising how seldom we find it neces ? sary to go outside the front gate and how much we enjoy ourselves within . We usually have friends staying with us ? a married couple , or a bachelor friend of mine and a friend of Cynthia 's , and perhaps one or two of the children 's friends ( there are lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to golf ( there is a good course about a mile away ) in the morn ? ing or the afternoon , and she and Cyn ? this will sit with their books and needle work in a sunny corner of the garden .

And after tea , by established usage and tradition , the whole lot of us play cricket on the lawn until it 's time for the kids to go to bed . When I started to write this article I had n't the smallest intention of writing an intimate and detailed account of our daily existence . My idea was to draw a picture of the life of the English middle-class as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debt we are in this post-war world . But when I came to draw my picture I found that the only members of the middle-class whose lives I knew at all well were our ? selves ; and that so far as we are con ? cerned , although the tax-gatherer is al ? ways with us , and the education of our children is a lowering cloud over the future , nevertheless we live , on the whole , an extraordinarily contented life . How far is that true of our class as a whole ? I think that we are in fact happier and more contented than most of our neighbors ; but I think also that that is because we both of us happen by tem ? perament to be people who are posi ? tively conscious of our blessings , and not merely negatively receptive of them . Of our class as a whole it is true that they live differently from their fathers ; but to live differently is not necessarily to live less happily . We marry on comparatively smaller incomes , we spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard thrift as one of the cardinal virtues . We may perhaps have to pay in our old age for our failure to save now ; but meanwhile there is nodoubt that the standard of living is higher , in our class no less than in the lower classes , since the War than it ever was before . A rise in the standard of living is nearly always accompanied by an outburst of discontent among pre .. cisely those persons who benefit most by it ? the reason being , I suppose , that one 's hopes and desires always run ahead of one 's attainments , and that most people measure their contentment by the standard of what they would like to have next year rather than by that of what they actually had last year . I do not suggest that the economic condition of England is healthy at this moment : it is not , though I believe it will be within a measurable period . But if we compare the life of the individual in any class of life except that of the " landed gentry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unquestionably fuller and richer , if not more happy and contented , now than then . Even the unemployed are , com ? paratively speaking , hardly more numer ? ous ; and hard as their lot is , it is infi ? nitely less hard than it would have been and was twenty years ago . The " landed gentry " are gone , or nearly so . Their homes are empty , or bought up by the new rich ; their furniture and pictures and old silver and books have gone to America , and they themselves are living on the proceeds , comfortably enough , but with most of what made life worth living , including their work ? the gov ? ernance of the countryside , which they did supremely well ? gone .
