To His Majesty Ibn Saud , warlike Sultan of Nejd and King of the Hejaz , came tidings last week of his flourishing son the Amir Faisal , 19-year-old Viceroy of the Hejaz . The tidings were conveyed 500 miles by motor caravan from the Red Sea town of Jidda in the Hejaz , to the Sultan 's inland capital , Riyadh , in Nejd . There was it made known that the enlightened son &; Viceroy had finally caused to be obliterated that notorious imposture , " The Tomb of Mother Eve , " at Jidda . <P> Quaint , but probably constructed within the last millenium , the bogus " tomb " was an enclosure whose walls marked the outline of a supposedly buried female of gigantic stature . At the head was a raised mound . Midway in the enclosure rose a small whitewashed dome , protecting from the elements a mystic black stone , El Surrah . <P> Doubtless the young Viceroy Faisal has learned on his two recent trips to England that El Surrah , the navel , is taboo among moderns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the entire " tomb , " and to the removal among the debris of El Surrah.
