The radio made music news last week : <P> Walter Damrosch and the National Broadcasting Co. ' s National Orchestra ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) gave the world premiere of a symphonic work called S O S by one Robert Braine . Composer Braine had his inspiration a year ago in a radio station when S. O. S. calls came in from a Greek ship off Georgia . The same dots and dashes now punctuate his three-minute composition which , if uneventful , was fittingly enough the first to have its premiere by radio . <P> <P> Also on the air last week was Ganna Walska , charming wife of Harold McCormick , famed more for her wish to sing than for any actual singing . Many a manager has announced Wisher Walska , many an audience has been disappointed until newsmen have denied her a voice and she herself has pleaded stagefright . Evidently the microphone held less terror than a sea of faces for Wisher Walska sang over the radio last week as scheduled , prettily , quaveringly , the " Dich teure Halle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daddy 's Sweetheart " by Liza Lehmann.
