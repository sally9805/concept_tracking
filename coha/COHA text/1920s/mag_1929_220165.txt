When a university is endowed for $82,820,000 , when a tycoon like Edward Stephen Harkness has given it $13,000,000 for an educational experiment , it is sure to be circumspect in its choice of treasurer . And Harvard University had to choose a new treasurer when Charles Francis ( " Charlie Ad " ) Adams was appointed U. S. Secretary of the Navy . <P> The new treasurer , named last week , is Henry Lee Shattuck . Unlike his predecessor , Mr. Shattuck has no " who " in Who 's Who . But not for some time has he needed such identification in Massachusetts . Since 1923 he has been Chairman of the Ways &; Means Committee in the Massachusetts House of Representatives . He could have become Speaker this year had he chosen , and Governor Fuller once asked him to run for Attorney-General . He did not choose . Detached of mien , not outwardly the politician , he appeared to feel that his post was at the purse-strings of his commonwealth and there he stayed , vigorously , vigilantly economical . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The answer to why he would leave the Legislature for the university is summed up more simply : he is a Harvard man .
