Pugilist Breitenstraeter , heavyweight champion of Germany , entered the ring in Berlin for a 20-round bout . His opponent was Paul Sampson , n ( in Germany ) Samson Koerner . Koerner was once a stoker on an American ship . In 1920 , in this country , boxing under the name of Sampson , he gave Gene Tunney , American light heavyweight champion , a terrific bout . The next year Tom Gibbons knocked him out in two rounds . Farmer Lodge ( TIME , Mar. 3 ) did the same . <P> So Hans Breitenstraeter and Sampson entered the ring together . Sampson has a weaving , elbowing way with him . Breitenstraeter was no Goliath . The first round was fierce . The second round was a great muss and Breitenstraeter was knocked down . In the third round Sampson swung a great blow at Hans Breitenstraeter 's jaw . The umpire bent over Hans ' prostrate form : " One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , kaputt .
