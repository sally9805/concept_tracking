After their New London conference last week ( see col 3 ) , the Governors of Alabama , Iowa , Minnesota , Missouri , Utah , Vermont and West Virginia journeyed into the heart of New England as the guests of New Hampshire 's Governor Charles Tobey to witness the ceremonious return of " Old Peppersass , " world 's first mountain-climbing locomotive , to the White Mountains . Named because of the pepper-shaker aspect of its vertical boiler and mushroom stack , " Old Peppersass " was built in 1869 to haul e-xcursionists ( including Presidents Grant , Hayes , Cleveland ) up the cogway to the top of Mount Washington . Withdrawn from service in 1893 , it went the rounds of exhibitions , was " lost " for years and only lately " found " by the Baltimore &; Ohio R. R. <P> At the foot of Mount Washington last week , B. &; 0 . officials presented the antique to the Boston &; Maine R. R. which in turn gave it to the State of New Hampshire . Before taking its place on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started one last journey up the cogway to Mount Washington 's summit . <P> The party of Governors and officials preceded it in modern cars . Laboriously " Old Peppersass " puffed its way up the steep incline , reached the top amid cheers . Then it started down again . Suddenly a wheel broke . Engineer Edward C. ( " Jack " ) Frost , its pilot in 1869 , lost control of it as it gathered headway . As it plunged toward the Jacob 's Ladder trestle over a gorge 75 ft. deep , its five occupants jumped clear . One of them , a cameraman riding on the tender , jumped into the gorge , died instantly . The rest were safe . Old Peppersass thunderously tore up the ties , jumped the rails , shot out into space , hit the mountainside , exploded . <P> The Governors , descending the cogway in their own cars , were marooned because " Old Peppersass " had wrecked the track below Jacob 's Ladder . They were transferred to relief trains , hauled back to the mountain top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer suits shivered as the temperature dropped below freezing and a chill wind swirled around Mount Washington . Women became hysterical , fainted . By midnight the alarm had spread and automobiles climbed slowly up the ten mile carriage road to the summit . Into them by lantern-light were loaded the 200-odd celebrants , to be carried 40 miles down the perilous mountainside . The last to leave , as dawn broke , Governor Tobey.
