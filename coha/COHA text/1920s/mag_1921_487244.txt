M ANY things are lacking at the Peace Conference ? truth-telling , for instance , and the banishment of diplomatic insincerity . One longs to find in the dispatches the story of some delegate's. rising to face the facts of the world as they are . The statesmen who sit around the green tables are precisely the type of men who pride themselves upon their practicality , upon seeing things as they exist , upon knowing just how far , to the inch , the public opinion ( or big business ) of their respective states will permit them to go . They are neither theorists , nor idealists ; their feet " are on the ground . " As Mr. Wilson was so fond of saying , they know what they want and how to obtain it . Real politics is their specialty . Were they not chosen to high office because of fitness for leadership ? Well , the simple fact is that these men in Washington are anything but practical . Perhaps this is due to their not being at heart really " sold " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps to their overweening fear lest some one of them get ahead of the others . At any rate , the evidence is clear that on all sides are things that could be done to forward the momentous task in hand if only the men at those tables were not so very great , so very wise , and so very profound . Sometimes it is obvious that little children could lead them . What if some daring iconoclast should rise and utter a few commonplace but true phrases . We believe that panic would follow ; that what , but for Mr. Hughes 's enlightened and businesslike directness of plan and procedure , would be a mere structure of all but useless official formalism would forthwith collapse . One sighs , as one did in perusing the dispatches from Paris , for a few homespun , simple folk to discuss and settle the whole question as it is being talked over and voted on at Newton Four Corners , and in the general store at Sandy Gulch . It seemed as if official formalism did its worst at Paris ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would happen , for instance , if some delegate , noting the demand for it in the powerful New York press , among the Englishmen , and in numerous other quarters , should rise to move the total abolition of the submarine ? The fat would , indeed , be in the fire . The whole sacred agenda would tremble in the balance . The Conference would have to ask itself , Why the submarine ? and there would be the gravest danger of the submarine being outlawed . Fortunately for the friends of the submarine , no delegate would think of so violating ' good taste and form ; so the submarine is safe and England is allowed more submarines than she really wants . The " great leaders " have brought with them advisers and councilors , aides-de-camp and scribes , secretaries and under-secretaries . But there is lacking a simple appreciation of the fact that those who should have been banned are the experts , naval and military . Had President Harding been wise he would have invited the Conference to Hot Springs , Virginia , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stated in his invitations that inasmuch as no American army or navy officer would be allowed within one hundred and fifty miles of the Conference under pain of court-martial our guests were asked to leave theirs behind  --  on the cowboy dance principle that " guns " simply must be left outside . From the moment the Hughes ? plan went to the experts trouble began : Experts must pickflaws else are they not experts and are thus not worth their salaries . And when it comes to consulting experts about plans which , if rightly interpreted , can only mean the beginning of the abolition of the profession to which they belong  --  well , it is expecting a good deal of human nature to ask that those experts do other than find reasons why any beginning of disarmament should be made as trifling as possible . There are , however , far more vital things lacking at the Washington Conference than a failure to understand , a fact which Admiral Sims has just pointed out in his address before the Naval War College , namely , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughout the Conference thus far its artificiality has been disturbed by no single reference to the dangerous economic status of the world . We search in vain the columns of our dailies for a reference to the fact that the old world these statesmen typify is collapsing  --  is , as Mr. Wells has written , steadily going down into the abyss without as yet a single intelligent effort to stop its descent to Avernus . These men act as if in a sterilized vacuum , as if their proceedings bore no relation to the question of foreign exchange , to the condition of their mostly bankrupt treasuries , to the state of international trade , to the lack of free trade everywhere , to the growing numbers of workers and starving men in Europe , to the threat of a general European collapse in the spring . They talk , like M. Briand , the language of a dead past . Thus the realists are the most unreal ; the men of affairs the most detached from the truly vital affairs of the hour ; the practical men the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sorrow of the world . Believing that they are making the world over , they fail to see their perilous resemblance to him who fiddled while Rome burned . Of course , it all goes back beyond that . Mr. Hughes truly remarked that there can be no real peace without the will to peace . But the will to peace must come from an appreciation of the spiritual values of the world ; from a realization that war in its every aspect defiles the ark of the covenant of humanity , that it is a deadly sin against whatever is godlike in man . Peace requires a realization that , as the Great War finally proved , violence accomplishes nothing , and that , even now , the human race is paying a frightful price for its sin against all that is sacred . In the Washington Conference , if we judge aright , there is not one word spoken to show that the spiritual lessons of the war have been learned or even understood . The emphasis is all upon the need of cutting down expenses , lightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , perhaps , out of place in such a gathering . But how one longs for a single orator to tell what these armament burdens mean to the poor , the lowly , the toiling ; for a single speaker to voice the feelings of the poilus of all lands to whom war means death or unbearable suffering . Finally , the greatest lack of all is one clear note of brotherhood . To this Conference it is as though the Prince of Peace had never brought to men a message of good-will . Hence all that we shall get , little or great , from the Conference is merely on account . The will to peace can not prevail while men will not see or refuse to use the talisman that even now lies within their grasp . The Degradation of Teaching I N the revolutionary thought and experimentation which are enriching our conception of popular education one elementary principle stands fixed : The child is entitled to suitable physical environment in which to carry on his studies and to the best possible teaching . It is precisely these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us that school children are denied . That organization is conducting , with the aid of experts , a valuable series of inquiries into the New York public schools , and has already made public reports showing defects in the physical conditions of school buildings which seriously affect the health of teachers and pupils . More recently it has performed an even more immediate public service in calling attention to the following order from the Division of Examination and Inspection of the New York State Department of Education . It is addressed to principals of public schools and orders them to prepare reports as to the loyalty of teachers in the following manner : 1 . List the name of each teacher under your jurisdiction . 2 . Place a check mark in column one opposite the name of each teacher for whose morality and loyalty as a citizen you can personally vouch. 3 . In column two check the name of each teacher whom you can not vouch for from personal knowledge , but can do so on information that you consider thoroughly reliable . 4 . In column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not vouch for from personal knowledge or reliable information , or of whose morality , or loyalty to the government of the United States or of the State of New York you have reasonable doubt . The reports are secret and go to authorities who have power to revoke teachers ' licenses without a hearing . Such is the perfect fruit of the Lusk law , which and r cover of guaranteeing the loyalty of all teachers enthrones reaction and hypocrisy in the public schools . The Teachers ' Union rightly holds that " the order is not only a denial of civil liberty , but is also an act establishing a policy of espionage . " A public which has recently shown a callous indifference to the civil liberties of workers and to espionage over them is not likely to rise in its wrath because the present victims are teachers . But there is a great tradition in America of regard for education and hope in what it may accomplish , and men who are indifferent to civil liberty may be stirred if they can be brought to reflect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already it is hard enough to get an adequate supply of halfway competent men and women to enter the teaching profession . This new decree will lock a door which has already been closed in the face of idealists who would give themselves to the work of teaching . Even the most loyal American , according , let us say , to the New York Times 's understanding of that much-abused term , will be reluctant to place himself at the mercy of the whim , caprice , prejudice  --  religious , personal , or political  --  of a principal who is not his leader in a democratic profession but a spy whose secret report may wreck his whole career . Nor is this the worst . The existence of the state of mind , the mingled servility , fear , suspicion , sycophancy , and hypocrisy which such an order directly encourages is fatal to good teaching . Children feel more than they understand and in such an atmosphere you can not make good citizens , to say nothing of honest men and women . New York has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal for improving rural education . Here is a more urgent challenge to him . What will Mr. Graves do about it ? Even though the decree may have been issued as a matter of routine , without his knowledge , his is the ultimate responsibility . The decree may be the logical development of the Lusk law but it is not absolutely required even by that vicious measure . The first duty , then , of teachers and citizens whose hope is in the next generation is to demand from Mr. Graves revocation of this order ; the second is to obtain from the next legislature the repeal of the Lusk laws . Teachers who resent espionage ought to remember that their profession has in its own hands the means of its salvation . If all else fails , they could as an organized body refuse to teach under a system which humiliates them as citizens and degrades them as teachers . Such an act might be a strike against the state but it would be a service to society . We Feast ? They Starve S OME Americans economized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some ate ham instead of chicken . On Christmas Day most of us will eat turkey , or chicken , or goose , or ham , again , and potatoes roasted with the meat , and cranberry sauce and celery , and vegetables , and plum pudding or pie , and we will top it off with nuts and raisins and oranges and candy . Meanwhile , in the valley of the Volga , the great Mississippi River basin of European Russia , some ten or fifteen million Russians think themselves lucky if on feast-day , weekday , or Sunday they can get enough black pancake to stay the gnawing hunger inside them  --  enough black pancake made by grinding down grass torn up from the earth , and leaves pulled from the bushes or picked off the ground , mixing the powder thus obtained with gluten from boiled horses ' hoofs , and baking the mixture as a substitute for bread . Anna Haines , who did relief work in Russia with the Quakers under the Czarist , Kerensky , and soviet regimes in 1916-1918 , and who.has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed with a trip back into the villages of the Samara province where she had worked three years before and which have recently been so stricken by drought , tells heartrending stories and shows sickening pictures of the misery there . " March will be the worst month , will it not ? " she asked one parish priest . " No , " he answered slowly . " No , I think not . This month September we have the melons and the sunflower seeds ; next month there will still be some melons and some seeds left ; in November we will haVe to use our reserves . But no one is rich enough to have reserves for more than six weeks . March the worst ? No . In March there will be no one left . " The terrible fact is that hundreds of thousands  --  perhaps millions  --  are facing death with that awful Russian calm . A peasant woman asked Miss Haines to take a picture of her baby . She was hoping to get away to Siberia , and she knew the baby could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember him by . Why is it that when people come to such a pass , when children 's homes have so little food that their superintendents have to pick out the children whom it is worth while trying to save and leave the rest to die , America calmly and contentedly eats turkey , or economizes on chicken or ham ? Why is it that there is no such great warm-hearted response as fed the refugees in France , and later , the hungry children in Germany , Poland , and Austria ? Partly , we suppose , because of callousness acquired from oft-repeated stories of hunger and misery . We are tired of giving to other people 's children . Partly , too , because the American people , warm and well-fed as it is in contrast to Eastern or even to Central Europe , is not so rich as it was two or three years ago . But very largely because it has been so stuffed with conflicting propaganda about Russia that it only half believes the pitiful stories of famine which come to it . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their elders change their form of government . But such people are not typical of America . The American people is as kindhearted as ever ; but it wants to know . In particular , it wants to know whether the hunger in Russia is due to a breakdown in government which will be repeated year after year until there comes some sudden change , or to an unusual and fearful drought . That is why the report of the Russian Commission of the Near East Relief , printed in part in the International Relations Section of this issue of The Nation , has such peculiar importance . It is the first comprehensive report of an unofficial non-political group which has had adequate opportunities to study the famine and its causes on the spot . Its conclusions can not be charged with partisanship . No need here to summarize them all ; but one set of data should be forced into the consciousness of editorial writers from one end of this country to the other : The rainfall through the Volga valley in April , May , and June of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaged less than 2.4 millimeters per month as against a normal rainfall ( 17-year average ) of 35.6 millimeters ; and the temperature averaged 12.6 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the 17-year average . Such was the drought that burned the seedlings in the soil and caked the hard earth against the possibility of a crop . That is the reason for the hunger of the Volga millions . Other causes  --  revolution , war , blockade  --  contributed to the mass of misery ; this is fundamental . Vernon Kellogg of the Hoover Relief Administration tells the same story . " In Russia , " he says , " the people who come down to the river landings and crowd the refugee camps are peasants . In Belgium we never fed a single farmer . In Poland we fed millions in the cities and industrial areas but sent no food into the country ; in Russia we have to feed the peasants , the food-producers  --  to the thinking man that tells the story . " Here at last we have the incontrovertible facts . No one can any longer plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . Senator France 's name stands beside that of ex-Ambassador Francis on the National Committee of the Russian Famine Fund ( 15 Park Row , New York City ) which is raising money to aid the Quakers in their relief work . Mr. Hoover is sympathetic , and President Harding telegraphs to Allen Wardwell , chairman of the Fund , that he confidently hopes that its efforts will meet with a gratifying response . Will we go on eating turkey or chicken or ham on feast-days , and buttering our bread and eating two eggs in the morning , with no thought or help , as a nation , for the stricken millions along the Volga ? Congress has shelved Mr. Hoover 's modest request that unsalable surplus war supplies be freed for use in Russia ; if America is to act at all , it must be through the gifts of individuals unwilling to be so comfortable while millions starve in Russia . Average Citizen Sees It Through T HE job of the Average Citizen used to be considered a desirable one . He was , in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such . All he had to do was to work for his living , play Kelly pool , and vote the usual way on Election Day . But of late years this has quite changed ; his life has become complex . The Average Citizen is expected to take an interest in a whole lot of things besides the baby 's measles and the price of Jerusalem artichokes ; he is asked to understand things that nobody else understands , to be informed where experts are at odds . Every little while an inquiring reporter will assault the average citizen , innocently faring home from his office , with the verbal brickbat : " And what do you think of the actions of the Japanese in the Transbaikal district ? You can have till I count ten to answer . " And the Average Citizen  --  always " picked at random " ? replies without a moment 's hesitation : " It is obvious that economic pressure dictates the westward expansion of Japan , but at the same time the right of self-determination must not be infringed . " Something neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other matters of international import are driving the more pugnacious of our mainstays to the verge of an Average Citizen 's strike . They are expected to have an opinion on the merits of 10 , 10 , 7 as opposed to 5 , 5 , 3 . They are supposed to concern themselves about the Cassell concession and the island of Sakhalin . They are informed of events in the most remote and mythical portions of the world and asked to hand down opinions on them . All this is good . The Average Citizen used to lead a lazy life ; we believe in making him work . But it does seem unreasonable to expect him to abandon his chief characteristic and encompass a range of knowledge that no one could possibly consider average . International affairs are the least of his technical concerns . Take by way of contrast the matter of food . The Average Citizen used to eat as much as he could conveniently consume of meat and potatoes , spinach and pudding . With admirable adaptability he abandoned this age-long custom and began eating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts , and carbohydrates . He took on vitamines with enthusiasm , and liked ' em . If this were all that was expected of him he would never have flinched . But recently he has learned that there are good proteins and bad proteins , good vitamines and malicious ones . One expert assures him that meat introduces into the system almost unmentionable horrors ; another that cheese and nuts are very pure and all that but not fit for human consumption . Raisins may contain iron , but they also contain sugar . Whole wheat may nourish the system , but does it not scratch the delicate lining of the Average Citizen 's stomach ? Red-blooded meat-eaters fight with pallid vegetarians over his emaciated body . What is the Average Citizen to do ? The simple way out would be to give up eating altogether , but this is not in his character . He always has an answer ready . The Average Citizen has hit upon the perfect balanced ration : Red meat on Monday ; salad on Tuesday ; suet pudding on Wednesday ; a raisin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday ; and on Sunday a pinch of desiccated thyroid ground fine . He has solved the diet question , but as his problems grow more numerous and more complex , who would change jobs with the Average Citizen ?
