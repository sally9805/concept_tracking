Errand of Mercy Sirs : <P> A friend has just given me your version of the Prison Episode . I am quite surprised at your unfairness . The terms you use , and the angle you viewed , agree with a certain anonymous threat from Springfield , Mo . My friend demanded that I write you , though , for he claims that your magazine endeavors to be fair and play the game square . <P> " Burly " is an opprobrious term . To view my purpose as one of ' ' death , " rather than one of mercy to the other 160 men in Cellhouse No. 3 is rank unfairness . Women and children and men too , were scared that night . Action had to be taken ; and , since I had no dependants , why I volunteered . This " hero " stuff is also distasteful to me . But I do n't care for your readers to have the impression of a Priest wishing death in preference to life . <P> I am not the Chaplain at the Pen .

I have been criticised for not going in this Cellhouse and persuading them to give up . Under the circumstances , that was quite impossible . I was also dressed for golf , and was on my way to the Club , when a young lady told me her Daddy was trapped by the convicts within the Pen . " Greater love hath no man , than a readiness to lay down his life for them . " That , and that alone was my purpose . <P> Relying on your American honesty and integrity I beg to remain , <P> FATHER PATRICK O'NEILL , O. S. B. Canon City , Colo . <P> 1 ) Reporting fact , not passing judgment , was TIME when it told how courageous Father O'Neill carried Death ( 50 Ib. of dynamite ) to blow a hole in Cellhouse No. 3 so that militia might enter and suppress the rioting convicts . <P> 2 ) " Burly " has no opprobrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : " Large or stout of body .

Wellesley v. Vassar in Anthropology ! <P> I know your editorial staff is very busy , but has your attention been called to the July-September 1929 number of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology ? Here , in a paper of 77 pages , is set forth the physical measurements of 100 or more young ladies of Smith College . I do n't suppose that so heavy a journal finds its way to your editorial table . I do n't feel competent to write a paragraph for TIME , but if you will permit me I shall be very glad indeed to mail you the journal , and one of your editors might handle this interesting subject . It is intimated that later the girls of Vassar , Wellesley , etc. , are to be measured . It seems the cephalic index ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Table 73 is set forth the leg lengths of these young ladies , which vary from 680 to 780 mm . <P> The authors-expert anthropologists-after laboriously measuring and tabulating the legs and calves of Smith girls , solemnly announce that the calves are " considerably larger than those of Jamaican women ! " This is due , they claim , to athletic exercises . Remarkable scientific discovery !
