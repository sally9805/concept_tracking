Arrested , tried , sentenced and jailed , last week , for " publicly kissing " were the first two young couples to run foul of a new ordinance of the City of Rome . <P> Needless to say the ordinance was ordered by Benito Mussolini , than whom no spark sparked oftener or more publicly in his hot youth . <P> Sympathetic Roman dailies printed only the given names of the jailed couples . Giacomo had been caught kissing Edwige , and Pietro was nabbed bussing Yole . The fact that both couples were engaged was called immaterial . Jail will hold Edwige and Yole for three weeks and a day , Giacomo and Pietro for six weeks and a day . <P> Eight disgusted parents postponed preparations for two weddings .
