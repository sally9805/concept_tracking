Having painted in almost every conceivable manner almost everything which lies upon the surface of the earth , painters are still at liberty to go under the sea for subjects . One such is Olive Earle , whose more decorative paintings of its teeming and extraordinary life were shown last week in Brooklyn . Her Bermuda group contained an oil canvas of the strange Deep Sea Squirrel Fish ; from California , she had retrieved Kelp at Santa Catalina ; her water colors included a portrait of Sea Anemones , bending in a warm current , and a cool atmospheric painting , Color under Sea . <P> Out of conceit , gratitude or a mixture of both , one Frances Clyne , Manhattan dressmaker , made arrangements to secure an entire room in the Anderson Galleries , generally hung with several score of paintings , so that she could hang in it one large , lonely painting . Conceit may have been her motive , for the canvas was an oil portrait of herself , its owner . Gratitude may more probably have been her motive , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederic Beltram-Masses whom , since he portrayed her in Spain two years ago , Frances Clyne has been booming as a painter of people 's faces . <P> The picture was simple and obviously the work of a competent craftsman with a color sense for the delicate rather than the flamboyant . More than this it was difficult to praise ; the picture was comely rather than beautiful .
