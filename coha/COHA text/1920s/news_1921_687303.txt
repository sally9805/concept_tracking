txt Dr. Wilbur P. eCrafta , superintendent of the international reform bureau with headquarters in Washington , the salaried lobbyist of the best organized reform interests , starts a  --  visit in Chicago with a violent attack upon moving picture theaters as the foundation upon which ' most present day evils are built up . From that he goes on to the dance hall and then to the automobile , which he describes suggestively as a " moving . bedroom . " Dr. Crafts has had some expeilence in the war of righteousness , as defined by hinTgelf , against the forces of evil , as also defined by himself . There was a time when he believed the liquor saloon was the breeding place of vice , crime , and misery . He was a leader In the tight against it . The liquor saloon is gone . The breeding place of vice and crime has been destroyed . Yet , strange to relate . vice , crime , and misery persist . What Can a conscientious reformer with a salary to earn do except to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , root and branch , and destroy them ? Nothing . So Dr. Crafts advances to the attack . He finds evil in the movie hotf  --  es , more evil in the dance hall , and a climax of utter depravity in the automobile . His course is clear . Attack them . Destroy them . Legislat ; against them . Leave not one stone upon another , not one saxophone upon an orchestra platform , not one coupe top upon a chassis . Cast them all into outer darkness . Destroy evil by destroying all sources and all contributing factors to evil . Make the world good by law . Leave not one stumbling block in the way of a weaker brother or sister .. Straighten and broaden and safeguard the way to heaven so that a blind imbecile can travel it without fear of going , astray . It will take some time , much effort by Dr. Crafts and his associates , years of lobbying , and years of salary collecting , but it can be done . Witness the almost total elimination of evil since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated the movie , the dance hall , and the " moving bedroom " he can extend his campaign to other things . First we would suggest elimination of parks . Benches and secluded nooks afford rare opportunity for the tempter in the ways of original sin . There should be no parks here a man and a maid may sit apart from their fellows and start with a handclasp , and then with a kiss , upon the road to perdition . And the moon , that purveyor of summermadness , must go . Many a girl has been lighted . t3 ruin by its beams . Bathing beaches must follOW . The influence which they exert is nothing short of scandalous . Away with them . Destroy the golf , links . A mixed foursome may he-divided In search for a lost= ball , and up will Jump the . devil .

Our young men are using them to carry a pair of dice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the entree and the roast . Tear down the veranda ; what sins are committed behind the screen of its vines ! Remove the davenport from before the open fire . It embraces potentialities of the most terrible evil . Remove all daikness . It has been a screen for vice and crime since the beginning of time , the loved enyironmentof evil . Away with it . Let-the sun shine twenty-four hours a day . It is n't much . of a program , but Dr. Crafts and his associates probably ' will be ** to undertake it , at a salary , when they have succeeded In running all the automobiles In.the cauntry out of gas .
