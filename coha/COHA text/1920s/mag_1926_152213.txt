The Franco-Spanish peace negotiations with the Riffian Foreign Wazir ( Minister ) , Si Mohammed Azarkhan ( TIME , May 10 ) , were abruptly terminated last week when the Riffian Sultan , Mohammed Ben Abd-El-Krim , rejected a 48-hour Franco-Spanish ultimatum which demanded that he and his people acknowledge the sovereignty of the Franco-Spanish puppet Sultan of Morocco , Mulai Yusef , who resides at Fez . <P> Wazir Azarkhan dramatically informed the Franco-Spanish plenipotentiaries that Krim will continue to defy them , crying : " I am glad and happy of it ! ... There is no justice in this world ; I go back to resume command of my men ! " <P> General Simon replied quietly in behalf of France and Spain : <P> " We take cognizance of the Riffian delegates ' declarations and state officially that the peace pour-parlers are ended and that a state of war exists . " <P> A few hours later , the so-called " Moroccan War " ( TIME , May 11 , 1925 , et seq. ) was again proceeding in desultory fashion . French aviators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced in the region of Kert conjointly with Spanish troops which moved upon Azib de Midar . <P> To all appearances the excessively freedom-loving Riffi , each of whom is accustomed to guard his personal freedom with his own rifle , can not be made to covet the blessings which might or might not flow in Morocco under a Franco-Spanish administration .
