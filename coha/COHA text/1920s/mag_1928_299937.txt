The trout season neared its close in Wisconsin . President Coolidge learned that trout feed by night as hungrily as in the daytime . He took up fishing after dinner and one evening stayed out until nearly midnight . Another day he caused his gear to be assembled and boarded a special train for Lewis , Wis. , some 90 miles away , where lives Charles E. Lewis , Minneapolis broker . The Lewis estate on Seven Pines Creek , like the Pierce estate on the Brule , has its own trout hatcheries in spring-fed ponds . The Presidential catch was 137 ( in two sessions ) . While the President fished , Mrs. Coolidge and John Coolidge took a swim in the Lewis swimming pool . Mrs. Coolidge said it was the most fun she had this summer . <P> On a rainy day at Brule , the President shot a shotgun at sailing clay pigeons and had the satisfaction of seeing 24 out of 25 break in mid-air-a surprising score for one new to trapshooting. * At Lewis , occurred a feat even more surprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , President Coolidge , Broker Lewis and Secret Service Man Walter Ferguson beheld a tall brown crane standing on one leg in the water , 20 yards away . Cranes eat trout . Broker Lewis pays a bounty of $2 for each crane killed on his acres . <P> " Ferguson , " said the President , " give me your pistol . " <P> There was a crashing report and the crane crumpled into the water , its wing broken . President Coolidge handed back the weapon smiling . Another Secret Service man bashed the wounded bird over the head , carried it home . The President waived the bounty . <P> It was reported that President Coolidge would leave Brule on Sept. 11 , go to Washton , then visit New England . <P> John Coolidge , after spending a weekend at Madison , Wis. , as guest of President Glenn Frank of the University of Wisconsin , was asked how he passes the time at Cedar Island Lodge . Said he : " Eat breakfast . Take a little walk . Read . Eat lunch . Walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to bed . " <P> One O. E. Olund of Fergus Falls , Minn. , wrote and offered John Coolidge a position in his National Bank . John Coolidge declined ; said he already had accepted a position ; did not say what position . <P> President Coolidge summoned and conferred with Major General Charles Pelot Summerall , chief of Staff of the Army . <P> President Coolidge appointed William Fairfield Whiting , Holyoke , Mass. , paper manufacturer , to succeed Herbert Clark Hoover as Secretary of Commerce ( see THE CABINET ) . <P> Accepting Mr. Hoover 's resignation the President telegraphed : <P> " Your resignation as Secretary of Commerce tendered some time ago is hereby accepted . I wish to express to you my appreciation of the character of the service you have rendered in that office . It has been of great benefit to the commercial life of the nation and has given a new impetus to our entire business structure . <P> " You have gained a knowledge of the mechanics of business and government that is unsurpassed . It will always be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise counsel in meeting the problems which have arisen during my administration . My best wishes will always attend you in the broader field to which you have been called . "
