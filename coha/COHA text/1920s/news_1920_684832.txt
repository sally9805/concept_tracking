txt THE SMALL COLLEGES . Their importance Overlooked When OMB Are Made for Education . To the Editor of The Neu York Times : Mr. Stimson , in a recent letter to Tun . NM YORK Tams , called attention to a class of institutions that he thinks large givers to the cause of education overlook . There is another class they overlook ? the small college in that part of our country where the large and dominant institutions are tax supported . The State institutions do not call upon their alumni for financial support , and hence do nothing to cultivate the habit of giving to educational institutions ; and yet their alumni are the richest and most influential in the State . It devolves , therefore , upon the small colleges to cultivate the peculiar American habit of giving to education . How different would be the financial condition of the Northern colleges if Harvard and Yale and Princeton got no gifts and expected no gifts from their alumni and friends . Mr. Frick 's benevolence will etimulatA every one of his wealthy friends and acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow his example . But I knew a liberal-minded Trustee of a Southern college whose wealthy associate , an alumnus of a famous State university , openly laughed at him for being connected with an institution which expected him to contribute toward its support . In ' the North these scoffers would themselves have been givers and would have incited their friends to larger giving . The small college is in reality an organic part of the American system of education , as much so as the tax-supported inqtitutions . The State gives it its charter , and it has a potent influence on the life of the State . The small colleges have in the aggregate more students taking A. D. and B. S. coursea than have the State institutions . A few years ago , as a result of an investigation from official documents , I found that while the State Institutions in the South had in one year 301 A. B. graduates and 396 B. S. graduates , the small colleges in the same territory had 609 A. D. graduates and 136 B. S. graduates  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges . The colleges are the feeders of the universities . Their graduates enter the professional and post-graduate departments of the great universities ; and if the colleges give a poor and inadequate training there will appear fatal flaws in the thinking of our most highly trained intellectual leaders . The colleges furnish a large percentage of the high ochool teachers and Principals , and from the high schools come the grade teachers ; and if the colleges give a poor education , . the whole State system of education is the worse for it . Besides , in the future the State univ.xsities are going to rely on the colleges to do more of the academic work , thus leaving them free to devote themselves to more strictly university functions . in some States they already are doing so . If the small colleges are such an important part of our educational system , ought they to be merely praised by Lord Bryce and the educational experts and allowed to freeze by the wealthy patrons of education ? 7-t .
