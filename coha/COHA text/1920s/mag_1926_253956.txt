THE MUSIC FROM BEHIND THE MOON-James Branch Cabell-The John Day Co. ( $6 ) . Of good publishing there can not be too much , and the present volume introduces a new house under an old name. * Chief among the tokens that this will be a house of distinction is its announcement that its public offerings will not be swaddled , as is the current fashion , in soft bales of superlative adjectives and the ejaculations of self-advertising pre-reviewers . The election of Mr. Cabell as first to bear the new John Day insignium , in a limited edition ( 3,000 copies ) , is evidence that the publishers intend kindly towards fine writing , and the book 's artistic execution intimates that the houses of Brentano , Knopf , Boni &; Liveright , the Viking Press , A. &; C. Boni , Houghton Mifflin and their peers are to have company in their pursuit of fine printing . <P> In itself , Mr. Cabell 's small book is but a melodious recapitulation of a poet 's life of malaise . The tale is of Madoc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased all but himself , he having heard the sweet , elusive skirling of <P> Ettarre , whose instrument was her heartstrings and whose home was the waste behind the moon . By dint of a cunning decimal point , Madoc abbreviated her exile in that place , confounding the Norns , as he thought , and establishing his happiness . Then it is shown how , having attained the unattainable , his life lacked savor still , until Ettarre died , a grey wife and mother , leaving Madoc with memories once more elusive and indispensable . <P> <P> * Printer John Day of England brought out his last book in 1584.
