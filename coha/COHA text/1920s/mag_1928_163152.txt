Scores of admirers of General Ulysses Simpson Grant celebrated the 106th anniversary of his birth by visiting his tomb on Riverside Drive , Manhattan . In the main speech of the occasion , National Commander Walter C. Mabie , of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War , flayed Mayor James J. Walker of New York for going last month to the unveiling of Georgia 's Stone Mountain memorial to General Robert E. Lee , and for appointing small Robert E. Lee IV to the mayoral staff which welcomed the Bremen fliers . <P> Commander Mabie said General Lee was comparable to " an aviator who would put water in the gas tank of a transatlantic plane . " <P> Commander Mabie cried : " Why parade the grandson of an arch traitor up the street dressed in the uniform of his grandfather with the insignia of the dishonored Confederate States on the sword and sash ? . . . We try to forget the Civil War , but they still remember it in the South ! "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
