Slap , slap , slap , for 3,600 times without a miss the fretting fists of William Ogden Heath , 27 , of Garden City , L. I. , struck the punching bag over his head . He was flat on his back , but not for virtuosity in bag punching . His hips and knees were stiff and painful from arthritis . Abnormal deposits of bone made them practically immovable . Drugs , vaccines , sun baths , oven bakings , changes of climate had done him no good . The disease had grown worse , and this backside bag hitting was an intelligent young man 's desperate effort to prevent his arm joints becoming swollen with the disease . <P> Except for the wit of his gymnastics , his was not an usual case of arthritis . Doctors know very little about the disease . Yet the Romans suffered from it , by the knobby bones of their skeletons , and the Greeks , the Egyptians , even the Stone Age men who lived in French caves . <P> <P> William Ogden Heath 's case came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , great orthopedic surgeon , professor at both the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and the University of Vermont College of Medicine , an Sc . D. as well as an M. D. <P> Just as the War began Dr. Albee was demonstrating original methods of bone grafting in Germany , England and France . He kept on in the French military hospitals , and later in those of the A. E. F. His invention of replacing , by bone grafts , parts of the spine diseased by tuberculosis goes by his name . <P> Dr. Albee believed he could ameliorate if not cure the Heath case of arthritis . Plan : To open up the knee and hip joints and scrape away the freak bone formation ; to line the knee joints to prevent fraction with fat and connective tissue from the thighs ; to replace the excised , but normal , bones and skin . That is what he did . <P> And from that operation William Ogden Heath was recovering last week-painfully but hopefully .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
