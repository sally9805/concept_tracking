IN MY wanderings about Europe last summer I fell into the orbit of a good many groups of tourists of various nationalities . In eastern Bel ? gium and Luxembourg they were chiefly Dutch and Rhinelanders . In Austria they were largely from Bavaria and the Danube States , while in western Belgium the English predominated . Elsewhere , especially in France and Holland , the vast majority were good home-grown Yanks . These wayfarers were something of a novelty to me , since I had not been in Europe for fifteen years during the tourist season . Even then I had seen only a few assorted job-lots in Rome ? mostly Americans ? and I had noticed them but casually , being pretty busy with other matters . But last summer I began to speculate about these groups as a social phenomenon , and more or less kept an eye on their qualities , behavior , and pursuits This led me to think up some reasons why the tourist is always an object of aversion and contumely to his countrymen abroad . " For Heav ? en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking me to suggest some tours in Europe , " do n't route me where I 'll run into a lot of American tourists . " A Belgian lady , too , com ? plained bitterly to me about the general run of Belgians she encountered on a trip to England . " They made me ashamed to tell anybody I was a Belgian , " she said . I find a certain lack of humor in this attitude . It reminds me somewhat of our hundred-per-center 's naive prig ? gishness about immigrants and their offspring . His own father may speakwith an accent that you could cut with a butter-knife , but he is no less strong for Americanizing all foreigners who are in the country , and keeping out all who are not . Over here it is a ticklish busi ? ness to say just what a tourist is , and it is still more ticklish to deride tourists or to put on airs about them . For my own part , I believe the con ? ventional reasons for disliking tourists have no more solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is to say , precious little . I have some objections to tourists in gen ? eral , and some to American tourists in particular ? which last I shall state pres ? ently ? but they are not the ones usually put forward . Most people think they dislike tourists , I believe , when what they really dislike is the effect of a crowd . They would feel the same at home to ? wards a lot of convention delegates if they found the place all cluttered up with them . Tourists give the impression of being always under foot , of pre &apt?ing; all the room there is , and swarming over everything . But this is due to their numbers and preoccupations , and it is hardly reasonable to dislike them for either ; nevertheless , one does do so . They are like women at a bargain-counter , or the people ahead of one in line at a ticket window . One hates them instinctively and puts them down as shocking pigs , when most probably they are very decent people simply busy with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who do not share them or who have preoccupations of their own . Again tourists are thought to look un lovely and " ornery . " For the most part they do . It is pretty hard for one who is steadily traveling to look otherwise . Besides this , it is notorious that the aspect of any large and more or less homogeneous crowd is uninviting . Look at the graduating class en masse of one of our women 's colleges , for instance , and you would take oath there was nothing like a pretty girl among them . Again , tourists are thought to have had manners . Superficially , there is something in this , but it is a relative matter . The English tourists I saw last summer had , in most cases , manners that I should regard as considerably under par if they had been mine . But they were not bad for them . National practices differ . I have been in England enough to know that English practice of the amenities at large is in intention neither better nor worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not just to let oneself be put off by a mere difference that indicates no fault in character or motive . Besides , there is the influence of a sense of strangeness , of sell-consciousness , and some appre ? hension . It takes a very large and ' ' easy release from one 's provincialisms to escape this , and few of us can command it . Not all of us escape this influence when we move a step or two out of our customary surroundings at home , and how much less the chance of escaping it abroad ! Mark Twain 's book The In ? nocents Abroad is fundamentally a record of the progressive workings of that in ? fluence ; and this , I believe , more than any of its other qualities , accounts for the book 's immense popularity with a traveling public . But I must begin to particularize about American tourists . Some of them got in trouble with a street crowd in Paris last summer , and had unpleasant f.xperiences , so the papers said , which ed President Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . 3e made the rather commonplace divisionof tourists into the sheep and the goats . In conversation with a much-traveled Englishman , whom I met on a train at the time of the incident , I remarked that the really objectionable American tourist was not often seen outside Paris , London , and a few fashionable resorts , mostly French , and that he went to those places because they are organized for him and are a kind of standing advertisement for his patronage ; and , therefore , they ought not to resent the only sort of conduct they could expect from him . " Quite so , " the Englishman assented . " They get quite what they ask for . " This is something that ought to be remembered when the behavior of the tourist is under consideration at home . President Coolidge 's second category of tourists might be subdivided as follows : I. Those who have more dollars than sense and who go abroad to splurge . It is vox pupuli in Europe that all one sees of this class are Americans , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this class has created a purely international type , like the Jew or the Quaker . Having spent many years in lower-middle Man ? hattan , and wearily plodded about Western Europe for a total of several . more , I have become pretty quick at spotting nationality , but I can do nothing with this type . It has become a matter of curiosity with me . Wherever I go in Europe I occasionally see people who might be American , English , German , Scandinavian , anything . Their charac ? teristic marks of nationality are all over ? laid by the one mark of having money to burn , and a great desire to burn it . Yet the most of these that one sees in Europe in the summer are presumably American , because , as things stand , there are more rich Americans than there are of other tribes . 2 . Those whose uppermost thought in going abroad is to make their escape from our peculiarly national inhibitions and prohibitions as thorough , obvious , workmanlike , and spectacular as possible . These , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potash 's friend Hymie Salzman , " with new idccs about tchampanyer wine yet , and not about garments . " 3 . The infatuate . These are they who have been in Europe before and have contracted an effeminate " crush " on some European center , almost invariably Paris or London . They get out of the steamer-train , glance around a grimy and hideous railway station , and into the iron countenances of cab drivers and commissionaires , and say , " Is n't it won ? derful ? Is n't it lovely ? Where 'll we dine to-night , and what theater 'll we go to first ? " In my judgment , these three sub ? classes make up the class of objectionable American tourists that President Cool ? idge adverted to . They are all direct products of extremely serious defects in our civilization , and as long as these de ? fects are unremedied , so long will they go on being produced , and so long will Eu ? ropean centers continue pandering to their weakness , viciousness , vulgarity , and foolery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , it is about all that can profitably be said , except perhaps that their numerical increase of late is evidence that the defects which produce them are being confirmed , and not remedied . But this evidence is not particularly needed . Concerning Mr. Coolidge 's first class of tourists , J can onlysay that everything I saw last summer bore him out hand ? somely in his championship of them . Of course I am giving merely the brief and casual observations of one person , but for what those are worth I had absolutely invariable reason to think well of my countrymen , and every comparison that make with tourists of the same class from other lands was in their favor . My first experience was with a rather special body of traveling Americans , very early in the season , when about two hundred hotel men , many of them with their families , came to Brussels , and were entertained at a gala performance of " La Traviata , " at the Royal Opera . When I heard that they were coming it occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation of my country as one could get , because hotel men are professionally trained to encounter almost any kind of public , and they have a professional knowledge of the amenities demanded by almost any kind of occasion . I was not disap ? pointed . After a week 's gruelling razoo from the hospitalities of Paris , these poor men and women had taken the train at six o'clock that morning , reached Brus ? sels at ten , junketed around town all day , were promptly in their seats at nine o'clock , and stuck out the opera to the bitter end at half-past twelve . H they knew anything about music they were too ravaged by weariness to care for it ? what they wanted was solitude and sleep . Yet they heroically did the right thing , and did it gracefully , until the very last dog was hung ? until a pretty Belgian Violetta finally expired , and the curtain went down . In the long waits between acts I looked them over as they dragged themselves about the lobby to fight off somnolence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste which they made in dress and manner , by their dignity and courtesy , and by their ter ? rific efforts to appear happy , interested , and appreciative . The tourists I surveyed in Holland were divisible into two lots or sets . One set seemed to be none too well off and to come from small towns where they did something regularly for their living . I saw several parties of these , all being piloted around by tourist-agencies . The other set , which also comprised several parties and was under commercial man ? agement , was apparently on the tour de luxe , stopping at the best hotels and , while not in the least flamboyant , looking as if money was no great object . I went around Amsterdam and the Hague in the wake of a couple of parties of both sets , mostly through museums , and accom ? panied one party on the all-day trip to Vollendam and Marken . Like the hotel men , all these people were dog-tired , fagged out , not with the healthy fatigue that comes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with the settled tiredness that means frazzled nerves and an undermined disposition . Yet not once did I see any of them show a streak of petulance , bad temper , or bad man ? ners . Not once all summer , indeed , did I see an American tourist of Mr. Coolidge 's first class show himself anything but kindly , good-tempered and decent . More than that , I was quite astonished to see how regularly these people ? many of whom I would regard as pretty un ? promising in this respect ? were intent on making the most of really good things . In the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam , for instance , I noticed some well-to-do , spoiled-looking young girls ? flappers ? with the usual vacuous face and hard expression , accentuated by utter weari ? ness . I wondered what they were there for , and kept an eye on them . I became intensely interested at seeing them pick out great pictures and try to get some impression of them . It was a hopeless attempt ? they were too tired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt and made it with a dogged persistence I should not imagine they could show even in dancing the Charles ? ton . Behavior like this was pretty gen ? erally characteristic of the American tourists who fell under my observation all summer I would give anything to know what they got out of seeing the things they showed interest in , or what it was that they were looking for and expecting to get . I tried to overhear some comments , but heard very few ? they did not talk much , which again surprised me , until I realized that they were too tired to talk . But the fact remains that in general they picked out good things , and tried to get something out of them . Current opinion and every recognized authority are against me , I believe , but I have come around to the notion that the American tourist is a good deal of a singed cat . Perhaps I ran into a stringof coincidences , so in giving my opinion I give it with all deference to those of larger experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman who looked extremely unintelli ? gent , and I think actually was ; but she had somehow accumulated an astonish ? ing amount of technical and well-knit in ? formation about art and architecture . I wish I had as much . I wondered where she had picked it up , and why . Her knowledge was not formative in her case , evidently . Though wholly of the forma ? tive kind , it had not " struck in " ; I could not see that it had especially affected her taste or her sensibilities . But inert as it was , she had it . In the same party was a woman from California who seemed very commonplace as , again , I think she was . But she had almost a professional knowledge of trees and flowers , such knowledge as I would give a great deal to have . Again , one day in Bruges I saw a couple , early middle aged , highly pros ? perous , very genial and good humored , neither of whom would one suspect of ever setting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet in their travels they had been industriously photographing a lot of architectural details here and there , in order to get practicable ideas for the embellishment of a new house . How intelligent they were about this , or how trustworthy their taste was , I can not say . I have great doubts . I suspect that the new house may turn out to be rather a terror , but the fact remains that with the best taste and intelligence they possessed , they were certainly trying hard and taking no end of trouble about it . On the whole , then , I am led to believe that the tourist has a good deal to say for himself , much more than he usually gets credit for . Nevertheless , I have some complaints against our tourist which I wish he would heed , be ? cause I give voice to them mostly in his own interest . The first one is that he does not organize his trip well . Artemus Ward said the trouble with Napoleon was that he tried to do too much , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists . They invariably try to cover from ten to twenty times the ground that Nietszche 's superman could profitably cover in twice the time ? and by gum , they cover it . They ca n't think of leaving out Rome , they must see Paris , they would never forgive themselves for not going to London , they ca n't endure the thought of not visiting Switzerland when they will be so near , and so forth and so on . I am speaking , remember , of persons of aver ? age seriousness , who regard a visit to Eu ? rope as something of an opportunity . They overlook the factors of weariness and surfeit . The human mind can not receive many sharp impressions in rapid succession without fagging , and after the first few the rest of the impressions simply do not " take . " Or , for a better comparison , the mind is like the stomach . It is not how much you put into it that counts , but how much it digests ? if you try to feed it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continental tourist is wiser than ours . He picks out a region that interests him ? a small one ? studies it minutely from all the books he can get his hands on before he starts , and then sees it methodically and thoroughly . He knows he can not see everything in the world , and prefers really seeing a little to looking at a great deal and seeing nothing . If our tourists would follow his example they would be much less of a nuisance to others and to them ? selves , and they would lay up solid profit out of every moment of their stay . To see the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam , for instance , or the Hermitage at Peters ? burg , and have any real idea of what is there , or any real feeling for what one sees , means a straight month 's work at the very least ; and to see the Dresden gallery means twice that . What is the use of walking through them in half a day apiece ? One would gel as much out of trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of one a second . It takes a long time also to get the feel of any strange city , and one who tries to get it in less is merely wasting precious time . Precious time ? that is what I wish our tourists would learn , that their time here is precious , far too precious for an hour of it to be frittered away in what really amounts to no more than desultory or galvanic motion . This brings me to my second count against the tourist , which is that he spends so much time on things that he can do as well ? sometimes better ? at home , to the neglect of things that can only be done here , or done far better . In speaking frankly of these matters , it must he understood that I am not dis ? paraging anything , but am merely speaking from the point of view of a person who comes to Europe with a strictly limited amount of time and attention at his command , and who desires to bestow them to the best ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am the very farthest from implying that Switzerland is not worth visiting . If I were English or European , I should go there . But why should an American go there when he can go to the Canadian Rockies or the Grand Canyon , or any one of a dozen places in his own country ? Not that Swiss scenery is inferior ? let us grant for argument that it is a great deal better . But is it so much better that the difference is worth the tourist 's time in competition with the enormous multi ? tude of things that Europe can display and America can not ? I doubt it . Take , on the other hand , the man-made scenery in eastern Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , as some ? thing marvellously beautiful that can ? not be matched in America . We have nothing even remotely like it . Let the tourist who is interested in scenic effects gamble on my assurance for a " flyer " of four hours in a motor car , and then de ? cide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so much worth seeing that he will remember it all his life . On a sunny day in late July or early August let him take the Hosingen Road from Diekirch through Vianden , branch off to Wiltz and Esch , and then return through Bursbeid and Ettel ? bruck . If he wishes to make the com ? parison clear , let him run over from Et ? telbruck about a dozen miles to Miller-that , Luxembourg 's prize bit of natural wild scenery . It will be no treat to him . He will find only the unpretending kind of thing that he can see any day at the entrance to the Adirondacks . Again , there are many things in Holland immensely worth seeing if one had all the time in the world . But why should the tourist who has so little time spend any of it in cruising about canals , looking at Dutch public buildings , windmills , and wooden shoes , or going over to Vollendam or Marken , especially since for such things he could do about as well at Nantucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so much to offer which can not be matched else ? where . My advice to the tourist would be , Go to Holland ? do n't miss it ? stay as long as you possibly can , and do n't stir a foot outside the museums at the Hague , Haarlem , and Amsterdam for anything but to eat and sleep all the time you are there . Those three mu ? seums are not by any means all in Hol ? land that is worth attention , but they are all that is worth the American tourist 's attention . Then there is the matter of the Euro ? pean cities one visits ? and here , I suppose , I shall step on red-hot burning ground . Remember , however , I am not speaking of what is appropriate to the spendthrift and snob , the infatuate , or the person who , in Mrs. Punwilion 's phrase , comes to Europe to pass his hours in roaring iniquity . I hereby " make the break , " and offer myself as a target for utter derision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist out ? side these categories , and with no more than the usual amount of time at his - ... ommand , should go to Paris , London , or Berlin , when he can go to New York . I have asked many people for a satisfac ? tory reason why he should , and never got one . I have nothing in the world against these four cities ; all I wish to suggest is that for a tourist 's purposes they are essentially so much alike that the handiest one is the one best worth visiting . Paris , true , has great beauty , and the others have not ; but so have many other Continental cities which in other respects are more worth the tour ? ist 's while ; and besides , the beauty of Paris , in my judgment , is far less inter ? esting and delightful than it is opulent and impressive . Paris also probably re ? mains the great exhibit center of the world in certain kinds of merchandise , but they are very few , and none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists should sacrifice the time to see them . Many Americans , I find , are under a curious illusion . They think that cer ? tain things which attract them are pe ? culiarly French , or even Parisian , when they are really European . " Not going to Paris ? " said one woman to another , in my hearing . " Why , do you mean to say you are going to miss the chance of drinking coffee at one of those charming places where they have tables out on the sidewalk ? " The fact is that there are precious few crossroad villages , even , let alone cities , in all Europe , where these agreeable facilities are not to be found . If the tourist Iooks into it , he will learn that the point of this story touches a great many matters beside sidewalk cafes . It touches art and architecture , clothes , cooking ? yes , really ? antiqui ? ties , music , the theater , and any number of interesting things , both great and small . My third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regard ? ing Europe as an eligible place for American youth , I am becoming as skeptical about it as Thomas Jefferson was , and for the same reason . I never yet knew a very young person to come here who got much out of it that was worth having , or , if he stayed any length of time , did not in some way deteriorate under it . Our tourists , being young , are too inexperienced , too unthought ? ful ; they have read too little and ineffec ? tively , and they possess in consequence too vague , shifting , and incompetent an idea of what they are here for , what they want , where best to find it , and if they do find it , how to recognize it and properly take it in . Europe is for maturity , not for youth , ? maturity in thought , reflective power , observation , appreciation . Let the intending tour ? ist be patient and remember that youth is a disability from which nne usually recovers , and that as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary . There arc enough of these , generally , without aggravating them by an undertaking which in the nature of things can not be very prof ? itable , but which is pretty sure to yield decent dividends if deferred until it can be approached more intelligently , and with less regard to the solicitations ( wholly innocent , no doubt ) of mere crude sensation . The tourist may resent , as unsympa ? thetic , the frankness of my observa ? tions , but he is quite wrong . He has my sympathy before he starts , when he is contemplating in imagination the myriad attractions of Europe , for I myself have confronted a Norwegian breakfast in my day . I have come down in the morning and faced a buffet bearing eleven kinds of cheese and thir ? teen kinds of smoked fish . I wanted to eat them all , but it was not practicable ? or even half of them ? one would die the death of the unrighteous before noon . One 's memory was haunted by whatever one decided to leave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it make the things one chose seem dis ? satisfying . But if one just sensibly carried through , one did well in the end , and was happy ; and if not , not . I sympathize with the tourist also in hissudden taste of the holiday spirit , which is the spice of one 's skimmer and flavors everything delightfully if one does not try to make a whole meal of it . I sympathize with him especially after his foot has slipped and carried him into a preposterously impossible sched ? ule ; for his desolating and benumbing weariness exceeds any known to man . Hardly an American tourist did I see all summer who was not so tired that he had practically lost all the attributes of a sentient being . Above all , I sym ? pathize with him in his constant sub ? jection to a running fire of alluring temptations from tourist literature . I am a great friend to commercial sight ? seeing . It does the work of the old-style personal courier , and does it better , as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mc on the whole a good thing , though I never took one ? I speak only from observation ? and particularly good for people who need to get out of a rut , if they happen to be the kind that can rest on ship ? board and can enjoy travel . I can do neither , so to mc , and those like me , the cruise would be a hard life . But commendable as commercial sightseeing is , one should use its facilities intelli ? gently , and not deliver oneself over , soul and body , to the tourist agency . Here again I would say that the Con ? tinental traveler is a little wiser than ours . He goes independently to a region he wishes to visit , and when he gets there he uses the tourist agency 's local facilities for finding and exhibiting just the things he wants to see , and nothing else . So in all respects I think I am sym ? pathetic with the tourist , and entirely on his side . Long may he wave ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also to get out from under the oblo ? quy that now attaches to his appella ? tion . Following the three suggestions I have offered will help him to both . Let him put off starting until a little of youth 's effervescence has subsided . Then let him make a schedule which is within the limits of reasonable human endurance , and one which comprises only matters which are distinctly and beyond doubt such as he can not com ? pass at home . It might be , moreover , that he could get the tourist agencies to lend a hand and simplify things for him in their highly competent way . Looking over their literature at large , I think they do not at present advertise much service that is organized qualitatively . They have not arranged and grouped sets of attractions to meet any definite inter ? ests , or presented plans for the intensive and leisurely consideration of small areas with reference to special interests . I am not a business man and , therefore , can not say that it would be commer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason against it . Even if the margin of direct profit were small , it might still have value as a business-getter , for I believe that on this basis they mightfigure out how a person could manage two trips for only a moderate " raise " on the price of one . Along with their offers , I mean , showing how much ground you may cover for the money , and how many indiscriminate things you may see , they might make some offers showing how thoroughly and comfortably you may cover certain carefully assorted sets of attractions in a relatively small area . But whether they see their way to do anything like this or not , it is still possible for the tourist to arrange his schedules for himself , though probably not so well , and use their local facilities in carrying them out . If the tourist takes what I have said in good part , he will form the closest and most intelligent of sentimental ties with Europe , and then I shall he more on his side than ever , because we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not ? indeed , if he ridicules with Homeric laughter every word I say ? I shall still continue staunchly to be on his side .
