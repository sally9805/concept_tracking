txt President Coolidge today expressed the hope that the naval conference which assembles in Geneva on Monday would effect results beneficial to the world . Standing on the lawn of his mountain Summer home , he told the visiting editors of the National Editorial Association that he was in intimate touch with world events , and that he was watching with great interest the progress of this conference called by him to limit the building of light cruisers and submarines not included in the Washington naval treaties . The President spoke as follows : " It is a great pleasure to welcome your association to South Dakota . It is true that I have been here only two or three days , but the people have extended to us such a hearty welcome that I feel like one of the oldest inhabitants and consider myself endowed with the privilege of extending a welcome to you in behalf of the State . " Some of you I have seen at other times in Boston and Washington , and I am glad to see you are taking the opportunity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now making . I doubt if you will find anything more inspiring than this locality and State . Other places may have developed more industrially and have a longer history , but none is more romantic , and I do not know any that has made such a development in such a short time . " When you write your dispatches 1 want you to advertise this wonderful country . I am going to do all I can to advertise it . " Many of you are a long way from home . I myself am 1,800 miles from my base , yet I am in intimate to : +ch with Washington as if I were in Baltimore . Cleveland or Philadelphia . " Reports are coming to me from Washington all the time telling what is going on . " I am especially interested today in receiving a report on the conference on naval armament which is assembling in Geneva next Monday .

" : Visitors Gather at Lodge . The editors and their ' wives are touring the country after the Omaha convention of the association . Five hundred of them drove into the Black Hills from Custer just before noon . After a barbecue of elk at the camp half a mile from the lodge , they gathered in fropt of the lodge . President and Mrs. Coolidge joined the editors for a few minutes during the barbecue . After receiving the visitors President Coolidge made his brief speech . Mrs. Coolidge came in for as many cheers as the President . She was dressed in a white silk dress and wore a red blazer , red hat and red slippers . In the left lapel of her coat was pinned the diamond United States emblem . She also had a whistle attached to a woven Indian necklace , given to her by one of the Indian guides for her use in case she got lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called some . of the women by their names . " She still has her winning smile , " one woman said . To the little ones she was most friendly , often leaning over to shake hands . Several of the excited editors forgot to shake hands with the President , but Mrs. Coolidge did n't let any of them get by without a hearty grip . As they disappeared a cheer was proposed for " our President " and a rousing one was accorded . President Coolidge bowed and then the women members shouted , " and one too , for Mrs. Coolidge . " It was just as lusty as that given the President . Hears Crop Outlook Is Good . The first reception at the lodge certainly was not wanting in enthusiasm and President Coolidge showed plainly that he was glad to see the people of the West and discuss with them their problems . He invited Governor of Nebraska and Governor Bulow of South Dakota to join him on the porch . The three chatted about economic conditions and the prospects of crops in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumper crops . This improvement , they said , was making the farmers less discontented , but they were still hopeful of some Federal farm relief in the next Congress . Similar views were expressed by the editors representing farm journals . Nearly all of them agreed that the farmers were slowly realizing that the veto of the bill was wise . Ex-Governor , editor of The Nebraska Farmer , said that a poll made by his journel recently showed that the farmers were opposed to the bill . Almost universally , Mr. declared , they wanted an extension of the cooperative marketing system and more elastic credits . ' The farmer needs credits of at least a year , so that he can take care of his surplus , " Mc. said . " If he gets that out of the next Congress he will be satisfied . " Trout Refuse to Bite . President Coolidge had a luckless fishing day . Yesterday 's rain had riled the waters and the trout were not biting when he whipped the streams in the morning . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers and the dispatches which had come from Washington reporting governmental matters and world events . The lodge Is fast taking on the appearance of a real capital . Today a large American flag floated from the pole on the lawn , while the President 's flag and an American flag waved from standards on either side of the entrance to the lodge . Newspapers are received by the President by fast couriers from Rapid City and , with his reports over the telegraph from the Washington Executive offices , he is kept fully abreast of developments . Already the movement of tourists to this distant capital is under way . The road leading to the lodge is filled with motors bearing tags from all parts of the country . The hotels in Rapid City are so congested that the railroads are considering putting sleepers and diners here permanently to entertain the visitors coming over their lines . The West appears proud of entertaining the President . It has shown ' the utmost hospitality and is not disposed to express criticism of the Administration 's farm policy . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt . In today 's reception he met the men  --  the editors of the country weeklies  --  who have a large part in forming sentiment . To one of them he said that the country papers are important , that the readers in small communities know the editor and read his editorials and generally follow them . The President and Mrs. Coolidge will attend church services tomorrow in the Mission Congressional Church at Hermosa , twelve miles from the lodge . This is a small frame church built during the early days when the country was really wild and when it looked as if Hermosa would become a big settlement . It was the end of the railroad and the centre of the cattle development . The boom disappeared . It now contains 80 people , although the old saloon building and gambling dens still stand up with their dingy signs showing to what us : the buildings had been put . The mission did not have a regular pastor until two weeks ago . When President Coolidge decided to spend his vacation here Ralph Silum , a student of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent here . He has appeared in the pulpit twice . Boy Seized ' Snapping ' President . George B. Green , a Sioux Falls youngster , was seized yesterday by a Secret Service man in the Black Hills and his camera taken from him because he disobeyed the Presidential order that no pictures may be taken of the President without permission . After young Green was lectured by the detective and told that he must not do it again , he received his camera back and left in a hurry . Green and two companions were on their way to Hot Springs when they noticed President Coolidge fishing in Squaw Creek . He focused his camera and asked the President if he might take a picture of him . Mr. Coolidge shook his head . The little fellow thought the President meant yes and ' snapped ' him . It was then that the Secret Service man interposed . Three children ate a pound of Mrs. Coolidge 's candy today and got a severe reprimand from their mother , Mrs. Otto Johnson , wife of the State Game Warden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge , and giving her some points about trails in the hills , and the President was conversing with Mr. Johnson about fishing , the children slipped around the corner with a box of Mrs. Coolidge 's candy and gobbled it up . When Mrs. Johnson scolded the children , Mrs. Coolidge laughingly said that she was glad that they enjoyed it and hoped they would not suffer ill effects from it .
