txt // in character from those discussed in the main part of this chapter . ' IX. ? ? 1 . Conflicting Views . WE all know that in historical times languages have been con-stantly changing , and we have much indirect evidence that in prehistoric times they did the same thing . But when it is asked if these changes , unavoidable as they seem to be , are to be ascribed primarily to children and their defective imitation of the speech of their elders , or if children 's language in general plays no part at all in the history of language , we find linguists expressing quite contrary views , without the question , having ever been really thoroughly investigated . Some hold that the child acquires its language with such per-fection that it can not be held responsible for the changes recorded in the history of languages : others , on the contrary , hold that the most important source of these changes is to be found in the transmission of the language to new generations . How undecided the attitude even of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the views expressed at different times by Sweet . In 1882 he reproaches Paul with paying attention only to the shiftings going on in the pronunciation of the same individual , and not acknowledging " the much more potent cause of change which exists in the fact that one generation can learn the sounds of the preceding one by imitation only . It is an open question whether the modifications made by the individual in a sound he has once learnt , independently of imitation of those around him , are not too infinitesimal to have any appreciable effect " ( CP 153 ) . In the same spirit he asserted in 1899 that the process of learning our own language in childhood is a very slow one , " and the results are always imperfect .... If languages were learnt perfectly by the children of each generation , then languages would not change : English children would still speak a language as old at least as Anglo-Saxon , ' and there would be // // no such languages as French and Italian . The changes in languages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely alter the character of the language " ( PS 75 ) . But enly one year later , in 1900 , he maintains that the child 's imitation " is in most cases practically perfect " ? " the main cause of sound-change must therefore be sought elsewhere . The real cause of sound-change seems to be organic shifting failure to hit the mark , the result either of carelessness or sloth . . . a slight deviation from the pronunciation learnt in infancy may easily pass unheeded , especially by those who make the same change in their own pronunciation " ( H 19 f . ) . By the term " organic shifting " Sweet evidently , as seen from his preface , meant shifting in the pronunciation of the adult , thus a modification of the sound learnt perfectly ' in childhood . Paul , who in the first edition ( 1880 ) of his Prinzipien der Sprachgeschichte did not mention the influence of children , in all the following editions ( 2nd , 1886 , p. 58 ; 3rd , 1898 , p. 58 ; 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die hauptveranlassung zum lautwandel in der ubertragung der laute auf neue individuen liegt , " while the shiftings within , the same generation are very slight . Paul thus modified his view in the opposite direction of Sweet 1 ? and did so under the influence of Sweet 's criticism of his own first view ! When one finds scholars expressing themselves in this manner and giving hardly any reasons for their views , one is tempted to believe that the question is perhaps insoluble , that it is a mere toss-up , or that in the sentence " children 's imitation is nearly perfect " the stress may be laid , according to taste , now on the word nearly , and now on the word perfect . I am , however , convinced that we can get a little farther , though only by breaking up the question , instead of treating it as one vague and indeterminate whole . IX. ? ? 2 . Meringer . Analogy . Among recent writers Meringer has gone furthest into the question , adhering in the main to the general view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , it is grown-up men who take the lead in new developments , so it is grown-up men , and not women or children , who carry things forward in the field of // language . In one place he justifies his standpoint by a reference to a special case , and I will take this as the starting-point of my own consideration of the question . He says : " It can be shown by various examples that they changes in language are decidedly not due to children . In Ionic , Attic and Lesbian Greek the words for hundreds ' are formed in - kosioi ( diakdsioi , etc. ) , while elsewhere ( in Doric and Boeotian ) they appear as - katioi . How does the o arise in - kosioi ? It is generally said that it comes from o in the tens ' in the termination - konta . Can it be children who have formed the words for hundreds on the model of the words for tens , children under six years old , who are just learning to talk ? Such children generally have other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above a hundred . " Similar formations are adduced from Latin , and it is stated that the personal pronouns are especially subject to change , but children do not use the personal pronouns till an age when they are already in firm possession of the language . Meringer then draws the conclusion that the share which children take in bringing about linguistic change is a very small one . Now , I should like first to remark that even if it is possible to point to certain changes in language which can not be ascribed to little children , this proves nothing with regard to the very numerous changes which lie outside these limits . And next , that all the cases here mentioned are examples of formation by analogy . But from the very nature of the case , the conditions requisite for the occurrence of such formations are exactly the same in the case of adults and in that of the children . For what are the conditions ? Some one feels an impulse to express something , and at the moment has not got the traditional form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of his own from the rest of the linguistic material . It makes no difference whether he has never heard a form used by other people which expresses what he wants , or whether he has heard the traditional form , but has not got it ready at hand at the moment . The method of procedure is exactly the same whether it takes place in a threeyear-old or in an eighty-three-year-old brain : it is therefore senseless to put the question whether formations by analogy are or are not due to children . A formation by analogy is by definition a non-traditional form . It is therefore idle to ask if it is due to the fact that the language is transmitted from generation to generation and to the child 's imperfect repetition of what has been transmitted to it , and Meringer 's argument thus breaks down in every respect . It must not , of course , be overlooked that children naturally come to invent more formations by analogy than grown-up people , // because the latter in many cases have heard the older forms so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort being required to recall them . But that does not touch the problem under discussion ; besides , formations by analogy are unavoidable and indispensable , in the talk of all , even of the most grown-up ' : one can not , indeed , move in language without having recourse to forms and constructions that are not directly and fully transmitted to us : speech is not alone reproduction , but just as much new-production , because no situation and no impulse to communication is in every detail exactly the same as what has occurred on earlier occasions . IX. ? ? 3 . Herzog 's Theory of Sound Changes . If , leaving the field of analogical changes , we begin to inquire whether the purely phonetic changes can or must be ascribed to the fact that a new generation has to learn the mother-tongue by imitation , we shall first have to examine an interesting theory in which the question is answered in the affirmative , at least with regard to those phonetic changes which are gradual and not brought about all at once ; thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , is pronounced more and mole closely till finally it becomes i ? , as has happened in E. sae formerly pro-nounced se. with the same vowel as in G. see , now si ? . E. Herzog maintains that such changes happen through transference to new generations , even granted that the children imitate the sound of the grown-up people perfectly . For , it is said , children with their little mouths can not produce acoustically the same sound as adults , except by a different position of the speech-organs ; this position they keep for the rest of their lives , so that when they are grown-up and their mouth is of full size they produce a rather different sound from that previously heard ? which altered sound is again imitated by the next generation with yet another position of the organs , and so on . This continuous play of generation v. generation may be illustrated in this way : ? 3 HERZOG 'S THEORY OF SOUND CHANGES 165 It is , however , easy to prove that this theory can not be correct . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the mouth is far less important than is generally supposed ( see my Fonetik , p. 379 if. , PhG , p. 80 ff . ; cf. above , V ? 1 ) . ( 2 ) It can not be proved that people , after once learning one definite way of producing a sound , go on producing it in exactly the same way , even if the acoustic result is a different one . It is much more probable that each individual is constantly adapting himself to the sounds heard from those , around him , even if this adaptation is neither as quick nor perhaps as perfect as that of children , who can very rapidly accommodate their speech to the dialect of new surround-ings : if very far-reaching changes are rare in the case of grown-up people , this proves nothing against such small adaptations as are here presupposed . In favour of the continual regulation of the sound through the ear may be adduced the fact that adults who become perfectly deaf and thus lose the control of sounds through hearing may come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be understood by others . ( 3 ) The theory in question also views the relations between successive generations in a way that is far removed from the realities of life : from the wording one might easily imagine that there were living together at any given time only individuals of ages separated by , say , thirty years ' distance , while the truth of the matter is that a child is normally surrounded by people of all ages and learns its language more or less from all of them , from Grannie down to little Dick from over the way , and that ( as has already been remarked ) its chief teachers are its own brothers and sisters and other playmates of about the same age as itself . If the theory were correct , there would at any rate be a marked difference in vowel-sounds between anyone and his grandfather , or , still more , great-grandfather : but nothing of the kind has ever been described . ( 4 ) The chief argument , however , against the theory is this , that were it true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all languages would proceed in exactly the same direction . But this is emphatically contradicted by the history of language . The long a in English in one period was rounded and raised into o , as in OE. stan , na , ham , which have become stone , no , home ; but when a few centuries later new long a 's had entered the language , they followed the opposite direction towards e , now ei , as in name , male , take . Similarly in Danish , where an old stratum of long a 's have become a , as in al , gas , while a later stratum tends rather towards w , as in the present pronunciation of gade , hale , etc . At the same time the long a in Swedish tends towards the rounded pronunciation ( cf. Fr. dme , pas ) : in one sister language we thus witness a repetition of the old shifting , in the other a // tendency in the opposite direction . And it is the same with all those languages which we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of varying vowel shiftings in different directions , which is totally incompatible with Herzog 's view . IX. ? ? 4 . Gradual Shiitings . We shall do well to put aside such artificial theories and look soberly at the facts . When some sounds in one century go one way , and in another , another , while at times they remain long unchanged , it all rests on this , that for human habits of this sort there is no standard measure . Set a man to saw a hundred logs , measuring No. 2 by No. 1 , No. 3 by No. 2 , and so on , and you will see considerable deviations from the original measure ? perhaps all going in the same direction , so that No. 100 is very much longer than No. 1 as the result of the sum of a great many small deviations ? perhaps all going in the opposite direction ; but it is also possible that in a certain series he was inclined to make the logs too long , and in the next series too short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is much the same with the formation of speech sounds : at one moment , for some reason or other , in a particular mood , in order to lend authority or distinction to our words , we may happen to lower the jaw a little more , or to thrust the tongue a little more forward than usual , or inversely , under the influence of fatigue or laziness , or to sneer at someone else , or because we have a cigar or potato in our mouth , the movements of the jaw or of the tongue may fall short of what they usually are . We have all the while a sort of conception of an average pronunciation , of a normal degree of opening or of protrusion , which we aim at , but it is nothing very fixed , and the only measure at our disposal is that we are or are not understood . What is understood is all right : what does not meet this requirement must be repeated with greater correctness as an answer to I beg your pardon ? ' Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , of course , he does so in nearly every point , But no one knows if he pronounces his mother-tongue in every respect in the same manner as he did twenty years ago . May we not suppose that what happens with faces happens here also ? One lives with a friend day in and day out , and he appears to be just what he was years ago , but someone who returns home after a long absence is at once struck by the changes which have gradually accumulated in the interval . Changes in the sounds of a language are not , indeed , so rapid as those in the appearance of an individual , for the simple reason that it is not enough for one man to alter his pronunciation , // many must co-operate : the social nature and social aim of lan-guage has the natural consequence that all must combine in the same movement , or else one neutralizes the changes introduced by the other ; each individual also is continually under the influ-ence of his fellows , and involuntarily fashions his pronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's sounds . But as regards those little gradual shiftings of sounds which take place in spite of all this control and its con-servative influence , changes in which the sound and the articulation alter simultaneously , I can not see that the transmission of the language to a new generation need exert any essential influence : we may imagine them being brought about equally well in a society which for hundreds of years consisted of the same adults who never died and had no issue . IX. ? ? 5 . Leaps . While in the shiftings mentioned in the last paragraphs articulation and acoustic impression went side by side , it is different with some shiftings in which the old sound and the new resemble one another to the ear , but differ in the position of the organs and the articulations . For instance when p as in E. thick becomes f and 6 as in E. mother becomes v , one can hardly conceive the change taking place in the pronunciation of people who have learnt the right sound as children . It is very natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harder sound by giving the easier , which is very like it , and which they have to use in many other words : forms like fru for through , wiv , muvver for with , mother , are frequent in the mouths of children long before they begin to make their appearance in the speech of adults , where they are now beginning to be very frequent in the Cockney dialect . ( Cf. MEG i. 13. 9 . ) The same transition is met with in Old Fr. , where we have muef from mode , nif from nidu , fief from feodu , seif , now soil , from site , estrif ( E. strife ) from stridh , glaive from gladiu , parvis from paradis , and possibly avoutre from adulteru , poveir , now pouvoir , from potere . In Old Gothonic we have the transition from p to f before 1 , as in Goth. plagus = MHG. vlach , Goth. plaihan=OHG. fiehan , pliuhan=OHG. fiiohan ; of . also E. file , G. feile=ON. pel , OE. pengel and fengel prince , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with d from p ) , OE. peostre . In Latin we have the same transition , e.g. in fumus , corresponding to Sansk. dhumds , Gr. thumds.l // The change from the back-open consonant x ? the sound in G. buch and Seatch loch ? to f , which has taken place in enough , cough , etc. , is of the same kind . Here clearly we have no gradual passage , but a jump , which could hardly take place in the case of those who had already learnt how to pronounce the back sound , but is easily conceivable as a case of defective imitation on the part of a new generation . I suppose that the same remark holds good with regard to the change from kw to p , which is found in some languages , for instance , Gr. hippos , corresponding to Lat. equus , Gr. hepomai=Lat. sequor , hepar=Lat. jecur ; Rumanian apa from Lat. aqua , Welsh map , son ' =Gaelic mac , pedwar=Ir. cathir , four , ' etc . In France I have heard children say pizin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . There is an important class of sound changes which have this in common with the class just treated , that the changes take place suddenly , without an intermediate stage being possible , as in the changes considered in IX ? 4 . I refer to those cases of assimilation , loss of consonants in heavy groups and transposition ( metathesis ) , with which students of language are familiar in all languages . Instances abound in the speech of all children ; see above , V ? 4 . If now we dared to assert that such pronunciations are never heard from people who have passed their babyhood , we should here have found a field in which children have exercised a great influence on the development of language : but of course we can not say anything of the sort . Any attentive observer can testify to the frequency of such mispronunciations in the speech of grown-up people . In many cases they are noticed neither by the speaker nor by the hearer , in many they may be noticed , but are considered too unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speaker stops to repeat what he wanted to say in a corrected form . Now it would not obviously do , from their frequency in adult speech , to draw the inference : " These changes are not to be ascribed to children , " because from their frequent appearance on the lips of the children one could equally well infer : " They are not to be ascribed to grown-up people . " When we find in Latin impotens and immeritus with m side by side with indignus and insolitus with n , or when English handkerchief is pronounced with vk instead of the original ndk , the change is not to be charged against children or grown-up people exclusively , but against both parties together : and so when t is lost in waistcoat weskot , or postman or castle , or k in asked . There // is certainly this difference , that when the change is made by older people , we get in the speech of the same individual first the heavier and then the easier form , while the child may take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lip consonant as m , and before a back consonant as j , or because it fails altogether to hear the middle consonant in waistcoat , postman , castle and asked . But all this is clearly of purely theoretical interest , and the result remains that the influence of the two classes , adults and children , can not possibly be separated in this domain ? IX. ? ? 7 . Stump-words . Next we come to those changes which result in what one may call stump-words . ' There is no doubt that words may undergo violent shortenings both by children and adults , but here I believe we can more or less definitely distinguish between their respective contributions to the development of language . If it is the end of the word that is kept , while the beginning is dropped , it is probable that the mutilation is due to children , who , as we have seen ( VII ? 7 ) , echo the conclusion of what is said to them and forget the beginning or fail altogether to apprehend it . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be used by grown-up people as pet-names . Examples are Bert for Herbert or Albert , Bella for Arabella , Sander for Alexander , Lottie for Charlotte , Trix for Beatrix , and with childlike sound-substitu-tion Bess ( and Bet , Betty ) for Elizabeth . Similarly in other languages , from Danish I may mention Rine for Jakobine , Line for Karoline , Stine for Kristine , Dres for Andres : there are many others . If this way of shortening a word is natural to a child who hears the word for the first time and is not able to remember the beginning when he comes to the end of it , it is quite different when others clip words which they know perfectly well : they will naturally keep the beginning and stop before they are half through the word , as soon as they are sure that their hearers understand what is alluded to . Dr. Johnson was not the only one who " had a way of contracting the names of his friends , as Beauclerc , Beau ; Boswell , Bozzy ; Langton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Goldsmith , Goldy , which Gold170 THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHILD cg . IX smith resented " ( Boswell , Life , ed . P. Fitzgerald , 1900 , i. 486 ) . Thackeray constantly says Pen for Arthur Pendennis , Cos for Costigan , Fo for Foker , Pop for Popjoy , old Col for Colchicum . In the beginning of the last century Napoleon Bonaparte was generally called Nap or Boney ; later we have such shortened names of public characters as Dizzy for Disraeli , Pam for Palmerston , Labby for Labouchcre , etu . These evidently are due to adults ; and so are a great many other clippings , some of which have completely ousted the original long words , such as mob for mobile , brig for brigantine , fad for fadaise , cab for cabriolet , navvy for navigator , while others are still felt as abbreviations , such as photo for photograph , pub for public-house , caps for capital letters , spec for speculation , sov for sovereign , zep for Zeppelin , divvy for dividend , hip for hypochondria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pavilion , and many other clippings of words which are evidently far above the level of very email children . The same is true of the abbreviations in which school and college slang abounds , words like Gym(nastics) , undergrad(uate) , trig-(onometry) , lab(oratory) , matric(ulation) , prep(aration) , the Guy for the governor , etc . The same remark is true of similar clippings in other languages , such as kilo for kilogram , G. ober for oberkellner , French aristo(crate) , reac(tionnaire) , college terms like Besse for descriptive ( geometrie d. ) , philo for philosophie , preu for premier , ecu for second ; Danish numerals like tres for tresindstyve ( 60 ) , halvfjerds(indstyve) , firs(indstyve) . We are certainly justified in extending the principle that abbreviation through throwing away the end of the word is due to those who have previously mastered the full form , to the numerous instances of shortened Christian names like Fred for Frederick , Em for Emily , Alec for Alexander , Di for Diana , Vic for Victoria , etc . In other languages we find similar clippings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeuxis for Zeuxippos , Old High German Wolfo for Wolf brand , Wolfgang , etc. , Icelandic Sigga for Sigribr , Siggi for Sigurllr , etc . I see a corroboration of my theory in the fact that there are hardly any family names shortened by throwing away the begin-ning : children as a rule have no use for family names.1 The rule , however , is not laid down as absolute , but only as holding in the main . Some of the exceptions are easily accounted for . ' Cello for violoncello undoubtedly is an adults ' word , originating ? 7 STUMP-WORDS in France or Italy : but here evidently it world not do to take the beginning , for then there would be confusion with violin ( violon ) . Phone for telephone : the beginning might just as well stand for telegraph . Van for caravan : here the beginning would be identical with car . Bus , which made its appearance immediately after the first omnibus was started in the streets of London ( 1829 ) , probably was thought expressive of the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , batty ) for tobacco and taters for potatoes belong to a different sphere altogether : they are not clippings of the usual sort , but purely phonetic developments , in which the first vowel has been dropped in rapid pronunciation ( as in I s'pose ) , and the initial voiceless stop has then become inaudible ; Dickens similarly writes ' tickerlerly as a vulgar pronunciation of particularly.l CHAPTER X THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHILD ? continued X. ? ? 1 . Confusion of Words . SOME of the most typical childish sound-substitutions can hardly be supposed to leave any traces in language as permanently spoken , because they are always thoroughly corrected by the children themselves at an early age ; among these I reckon the almost universal pronunciation of t instead of k . When , therefore , we do find that in some words a t has taken the place of an earlier k , we must look for some more specific cause of the change : but this may , in some cases at any rate , be found in a tendency of children 's speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of Ic at an early age , and is , indeed , in no way to be reckoned among phonetic tendencies , namely , the confusion resulting from an association of two words of similar sound ( cf. above , p. 123 ) . This , I take it , is the explanation of the word mate in the sense husband or wife , ' which has replaced the earlier make : a confusion was here natural , because the word mate , companion , ' was similar not only in sound , but also in signification . The older name for the soft roe ' of fishes was milk ( as Dan . mcrlk , G. mach ) , but from the fifteenth century milt has been substituted for it , as if it were the same organ as the milt , the spleen . ' Children will associate words of similar sound even in cases where there is no connecting link in their significations ; thus we have bat for earlier bak , bakke ( the animal , vespertilio ) , though the other word bat , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we must explain the following cases of isolated soundsubstitution as due to the same confusion with unconnected words in the minds of children hearing the new words for the first time : trunk in the sense of proboscis of an elephant , ' formerly trump , from Fr. trompe , confused with trunk , stem of a tree ' ; starknaked , formerly start-naked , from start , tail , ' confused with stark , stiff ' ; vent , air-hole , ' from Fr. fente , confused with vent , 172 // breath ' ( for this v can not be due to the Southern dialectal transi-tion from f , as in vat from fat , for that transition does not , as a rule , take place in French loans ) ; cocoa for cacao , confused with coco-nut ; match , from Fr. media , by confusion with the other match ; chine , rim of cask , ' from chime , cf. G. kimme , border , ' confused with chine , backbone . ' I give some of these examples with a little diffidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childish confusion of unrelated words as one of the sources of irregularities in the development of sounds . These substitutions can not of course be separated from instances of popular etymology , ' as when the phrase to curry favour was substituted for the former to curry favel , where favel means a fallow horse , ' as the type of fraud or duplicity ( cf. G. den fahlen hengst reiten , to act deceitfully , ' einen auf einem fahlen pferde ertappen , to catch someone lying ' ) . X. ? ? 2 . Metanalysis . We now come to the phenomenon for which I have ventured to coin the term metanalysis , ' by which I mean that words or word-groups are by a new generation analyzed differently from the analysis of a former age . Each child has to find out for himself , in hearing the connected speech of other people , where one word ends and the next one begins , or what belongs to the kernel and what to the ending of a word , etc . ( VII ? 6 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the former generation , but now and then he will put the boundaries in another place than formerly , and the new analysis may become general . A naddre ( the ME. form for OE. an ncedre ) thus became an adder , a napron became an apron , an nauger : an auger , a numpire : an umpire ; and in psychologically the same way an ewte ( older form evete , OE. efete ) became a newt : metanalysis accordingly sometimes shortens and sometimes lengthens a word . Riding as a name of one of the three districts of Yorkshire is due to a metanalysis of North Thriding ( ON . pri3jungr , third part ' ) , as well as of East Thriding , West Thriding , after the sound of th had been assimilated to the preceding t . One of the most frequent forms of metanalysis consists in the subtraction of an s , which originally belonged to the kernel of a word , but is mistaken for the plural ending ; in this way we have pea instead of the earlier peas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset from assets , Fr. asset , etc . Of . also the vulgar Chinee , Portuguee , etc.i // The influence of a new generation is also seen in those cases in which formerly separate words coalesce into one , as when he breakfasts , he breakfasted , is said instead of he breaks fast , he broke fast ; cf. vouchsafe , don ( third person , vouchsafes , dons ) , instead of vouch safe , do on ( third person , vouches safe , does on ) . Here , too , it is not probable that a person who has once learnt the real form of a word , and thus knows where it begins and where it ends , should have subsequently changed it : it is much more likely that all such changes originate with children who have once made 11 a wrong analysis of what they have heard and then go on repeating 11 hhe new forms all their lives . Via. ? ? 3 . Shiftings of Meanings . Changes in the meaning of words are often so gradual that one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of this sort , like the corresponding changes in the sounds of words , are to be ascribed quite as much to people already acquainted with the language as to the new generation . As examples we may mention the laxity that has changed the meaning of soon , which in OE. meant at once , ' and in the same way of presently , originally at present , now , ' and of the old anon . Dinner comes from OF . disner , which is the infinitive of the verb which in other forms was desjeun , whence modern French dejeune ( Lat. *desjejunare ) ; it thus meant breakfast , ' but the hour of the meal thus termed was gradually shifted in the course of centuries , so that now we may have dinner twelve hours after breakfast . When picture , which originally meant painting , ' came to be applied to drawings , photographs and other images ; when hard came to be used as an epithet not only of nuts and stones , etc. , but of words and labour ; when fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of blond ' and morally just ' ; when meat , from meaning all kinds of food ( as in sweetmeats , meat and drink ) , came to be restricted practically to one kind of food ( butcher 's meat ) ; when the verb grow , which at first was used only of plants , came to be used of animals , hairs , nails , feelings , etc. , and , instead of implying always increase , might even be combined with such a predicative as smaller and smaller ; when pretty , from the meaning skilful , ingenious , ' came to be a general epithet of approval ( ef . the modern American , a cunning child= sweet ' ) , and , besides meaning good-looking , became an adverb of degree , as in pretty bad : neither these nor countless similar shiftings need be ascribed to any influence on the part of the learners of English ; they can easily be accounted for as the product of innumerable small extensions and restrictions on the part of the users of the h inguage after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of this sort we have others that have come about with a leap , and in which it is impossible to find intermediate stages between two seemingly heterogeneous meanings , as when bead , from meaning a prayer , ' comes to mean a per-forated ball of glass or amber . ' In these cases the change is occa-sioned by certain connexions , where the whole sense can only be taken in one way , but the syntactical construction admits of various interpretations , so that an ambiguity at one point gives occasion for a new conception of the meaning of the word . The phrase to count your beads originally meant to count your prayers , ' but because the prayers were reckoned by little balls , the word beads came to be transferred to these objects , and lost its original sense . ' It seems clear that this misapprehension could not take place in the brains of those who had already associated the word with the original signification , while it was quite natural on the part of children who heard and understood the phrase as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . There is another word which also meant prayer ' originally , but has lost that meaning , viz. boon ; through such phrases as ask a boon ' and grant a boon ' it came to be taken as meaning a favour ' or a good thing received . ' Orient was frequently used in such connexions as orient pearl ' and orient gem , ' and as these were lustrous , orient became an adjective meaning shining , ' without any connexion with the geographical orient , as in Shakespeare , Venus 981 , " an orient drop " ( a tear ) , and Milton , PL i. 546 , " Ten thousand banners rise into the air , With orient colours waving . " There are no connecting links between the meanings of glad ' and obliged , ' forced , ' but when fain came to be chiefly used in combinations like he was fain , to leave the country , ' it was natural for the younger generation to interpret the whole phrase as implying necessity instead of gladness . We have similar phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes gave place to I think and I like , the chief cause of the change was that the child heard combinations like Mother thinks or Father likes , where mother and father can be either nominative or accusative-dative , and the construction is thus syntactically ambiguous . This leads to a shunting ' of the meaning as well as of the construction of the verbs , which must // have come about in a new brain which was not originally acquainted with the old construction . As one of the factors bringing about changes in meaning many scholars mention forgetfulness ; but it is important to keep in view that what happens is not real forgetting , that is , snapping of threads of thought that had already existed within the same consciousness , but the fact that the new individual never develops the threads of thought which in the elder generation bound one word to another . Sometimes there is no connexion of ideas in the child 's brain : a word is viewed quite singly as a whole and isolated , till later perhaps it is seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was born . " You were born on the 2nd of October . " " Why , then , I was born on my birthday ! " she cried , her eyes beaming with joy at this wonderfully happy coincidence . Originally Fare well was only said to some one going away . If now the departing guest says Farewell to his friend who is staying at home , it can only be because the word Farewell has been conceived as a fixed formula , without any consciousness of the meaning of its parts . Sometimes , on the other hand , new connexions of thought arise , as when we associate the word bound with bind in the phrase he is bound for America . ' Our ancestors meant he is ready to go ' ( ON . buinn , ready ' ) , not he is under an obligation to go . ' The establishment of new associations of this kind seems naturally to take place at the moment when the young mind makes acquaintance with the word : the phenomenon is , of course , closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI ? 6 ) . A. ? ? 4 . Differentiations . Linguistic splittings ' or differentiations , whereby one word becomes two , may also be largely due to the transmission of the language to a new generation . The child may hear two pronunciations of the same word from different people , and then associate these with different ideas . Thus Paul Passy learnt the word meule in the sense of grindstone ' from his father , and in the sense of haycock ' from his mother ; now the former in both senses pronounced mcel , and the latter in both mod , and the child thus came to distinguish meet grindstone ' and mod ' haycock ' ( Ch 23 ) . Or the child may have learnt the word at two different periods of its life , associated with different spheres . This , I take it , may be the reason why some speakers make a distinction between two pronunciations of the word medicine , in two and in three syllables : they take medsin , but study medisin. // Finally , the child can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that when a schoolboy said that it was a good thing that the new Headmaster was Dr. Wood , because he would then know when boys were shamming , ' a schoolfellow remarked , Was n't it funny ? He did not know the difference between Doctor and Docter . ' " In Danish the Japanese are indiscriminately called either Japan erne or Japaneserne ; now , I once overheard my boy ( 6.10 ) lecturing his playfellows : " Japaneserne , that is the soldiers of Japan , but Japanerne , that is students and children and suchlike . " It is , of course , possible that he may have heard one form originally when shown some pictures of Japanese soldiers , and the other on another occasion , and that this may have been the reason for his distinction . However this may be , I do not doubt that a number of differentiations of words are to be ascribed to the transmission of the language to a new generation . Others may have arisen in the speech of adults , such as the distinction between off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same preposition ) , or between thorough and through ( the former is still used as a preposition in Shakespeare : " thorough bush , thorough brier " ) . But complete differentiation is not established till some individuals from the very first conceive the forms as two independent words . X. ? ? 5 . Summary . Instead of saying , as previous writers on these questions have done , either that children have no influence or that they have the chief influence on the development of language , it will be seen that I have divided the question into many , going through various fields of linguistic change and asking in each what may have been the influence of the child . The result of this investigation has been that there are certain fields in which it is both impossible and really also irrelevant to separate the share of the child and of the adult , because both will be apt to introduce changes of that kind ; such are assimilations of neighbouring sounds and droppings of consonants in groups . Also , with regard to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is natural to assume many intermediate stages through which the sound or signification must have passed before arriving at the final result , children and adults must share the responsibility for the change . Clippings of words occur in the speech of both classes , but as a rule adults will keep the beginning of a word , while very small children will perceive or remember only the end of a word and use that for the whole . But finally there are some kinds of changes which must wholly or chiefly be charged to the account 12 // of children : such are those leaps in sound or signification in which intermediate stages are out of the question , as well as confusions of similar words and misdivisions of words , and the most violent differentiations of words . I wish , however , here to insist on one point which has , I think , become more and more clear in the course of our disquisition , namely , that we ought not really to put the question like this : Are linguistic changes due to children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really one of age , which is evidently one of degree only , but that between the first learners of the sound or word in question and those who use it after having once learnt it . In the latter case we have mainly to do with infinitesimal glidings , the results of which , when summed up in the course of long periods of time , may be very considerable indeed , but in which it will always be possible to detect intermediate links connecting the extreme points . In contrast to these changes occurring after the correct ( or original ) form has been acquired by the individual , we have changes occurring simultaneously with the first acquisition of the word or form in question , and thus due to the fact of its transmission to a new generation , or , to speak more generally , and , indeed , more correctly , to new individuals . The exact age of the learner here is of little avail , as will be seen if we take some examples of metanalysis . It is highly probable that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a pease and a cherries , were little children ; but a Chinee and a Portuguee are not necessarily , or not pre-eminently , children 's words : on the other hand , it is to me indubitable that these forms do not spring into existence in the mind of someone who has previously used the forms Chinese and Portuguese in the singular number , but must be due to the fact that the forms the Chinese and the Portuguese ( used as plurals ) have been at once apprehended as made up of Chinee , Portuguee + the plural ending -s by a person hearing them for the first time ; similarly in all the other cases . We shall see in a later chapter that the adoption ( on the part of children and adults alike ) of sounds and words from a foreign tongue presents certain interesting points of resemblance with these instances of change : in both cases the innovation begins when some individual is first made acquainted with linguistic elements that are new to him . X. ? ? 6 . Indirect Influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be referred to a child 's first acquisition of language . But we have not yet done with the part which children play in // linguistic development . There are two things which must be sharply distinguished from the phenomena discussed in the preceding chapter ? the first , that grown-up people in many cases catch up the words and forms used by children and thereby give them a power of survival which they would not have otherwise ; the second , that grown-up people alter their own language so as to meet children half-way . As for the first point , we have already seen examples in which mothers and nurses have found the baby 's forms so pretty that they have adopted them themselves . Generally these forms are confined to the family circle , but they may under favourable circumstances be propagated further . A special case of the highest interest has been fully discussed in the section about words of the mamma-class . As for the second point , grown-up people often adapt their speech to the more or less imaginary needs of their children by pronouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ' and come , ' etc . This notion clearly depends on a misunderstanding , and can only retard the acquisition of the right pronunciation ; the child understands good and come at least as well , if not better , and the consequence may be that when he is able himself to pronounce g and k he may consider it immaterial , because one can just as well say d and t as g and k , or may be bewildered as to which words have the one sound and which the other . It can only be a benefit to the child if all who come in contact with it speak from the first as correctly , elegantly and clearly as possible ? not , of course , in long , stilted sentences and with many learned book-words , but naturally and easily . When the child makes a mistake , the most effectual way of correcting it is certainly the indirect one of seeing that the child , soon after it has made the mistake , hears the correct form . If he says A waps stinged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hurt much when the wasp stung you ? ' etc . No special emphasis even is needed ; next time he will probably use the correct form . But many parents are not so wise ; they will say stinged themselves when once they have heard the child say so . And nurses and others have even developed a kind of artificial nursery language which they imagine makes matters easier for the little ones , but which is in many respects due to erroneous ideas of how children ought to talk rather than to real observation of the way children do talk . Many forms are handed over traditionally from one nurse to another , such as totties , tootems or toutsies for feet ' ( from trotters ? ) , toothy-peg for tooth , ' tummy or tumtum for stomach , ' tootleums for babies , ' shooshoo for a fly . ' I give a connected specimen of this nursery language ( from Egerton , // Keynotes , 85 ) : " Didsum was denn ? Oo did ! Was urns de prettiest itta sweetums dean ? Oo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nasty shawl an ' joggle ' em in an ole puff-puff , um did , was a shame ! Hitchy cum , bitchy cum , bitchy cum hi , Chinaman no likey me " This reminds one of pidgin-English , and in a later chapter we shall see that that and similar bastard languages are partly due to the same mistaken notion that it is necessary to corrupt one 's language to be easily understood by children and inferior races . Very frequently mothers and nurses talk to children in diminutives . When many of these have become established in ordinary speech , losing their force as diminutives and displacing the proper words , this is another result of nursery language . The phenomenon is widely seen in Romance languages , where auricula , Fr. oreille , It . orecchio , displaces auris , and avicellus , Fr. oiseau , It . uccello , displaces avis ; we may remember that classical Latin had already oculus , for eye . ' 1 It is the same in Modern Greek . An example of the same tendency , though not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the English bird ( originally young bird ' ) and rabbit ( originally = young rabbit ' ) , which have displaced fowl and coney . A very remarkable case of the influence of nursery language on normal speech is seen in many countries , viz. in the displacing of the old word for right ' ( as opposed to left ) . The distinction of right and left is not easy for small children : some children in the upper classes at school only know which is which by looking at some wart , or something of the sort , on one of their hands , and have to think every time . Meanwhile mothers and nurses will frequently insist on the use of the right ( dextera ) hand , and when they are not understood , will think they make it easier for the child by saying No , the right hand , ' and so it comes about that in many languages the word that originally means correct ' is used with the meaning dexter . ' So we have in English right , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which displaces desire ; in Spanish also la derecha has begun to be used instead of la diestra ; similarly ; in Swedish den vackra harden instead of hogra , and in Jutlandish dialects den kjon hand instead of hojre . X. ? ? 7 . New Languages . In a subsequent chapter ( XIV ? 5 ) we shall consider the theory that epochs in which the changes of some language proceed at a // more rapid pace than at others are due to the fact that in times of fierce , widely extended wars many men leave home and remain abroad , either as settlers or as corpses , while the women left behind have to do the field-work , etc. , and neglect their homes , the consequence being that the children are left more to themselves , and therefore do not get their mistakes in speech corrected as much as usual . A somewhat related idea is at the bottom of a theory advanced as early as 1886 by the American ethnologist Horatio Hale ( see " The Origin of Languages , " in the American Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " The Development of Language , " the Canadian Institute , Toronto , 1888 ) . As these papers seem to have been entirely unnoticed by leading philologists , I shall give a short abstract of them , leaving out what appears to me to be erroneous in the light of recent linguistic thought and research , namely , his application of the theory to explain the supposed three stages of linguistic development , the monosyllabic , the agglutinative and the flexional . Hale was struck with the fact that in Oregon , in a region not much larger than France , we find at least thirty different families of languages living together . It is impossible to believe that thirty separate communities of speechless precursors of man should have begun to talk independently of one another in thirty distinct languages in this district . Hale therefore concludes that the origin of linguistic stocks is to be found in the language-making instinct of very young children . When two children who are just beginning to speak are thrown much together , they sometimes invent a complete language , sufficient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their parents . In an ordinary household , the conditions under which such a language would be formed are most likely to occur in the case of twins , and Hale now proceeds to mention those instances ? five in all ? that he has come ac os s of languages framed in this manner by young children . He concludes : " It becomes evident that , to ensure the creation of a speech which shall be a parent of a new language stock , all that is needed is that two or more young children should be placed by themselves in a condition where they will be entirely , or in a large degree , free from the presence and influence of their elders . They must , of course , continue in this condition long enough to grow up , to form a household , and to have descendants to whom they can communicate their new speech . " These conditions he finds among the hunting tribes of America , in which it is common for single families to wander off from the main band . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their flight would merely carry them into the territory of // another tribe , among whom , if well received , they would quickly be absorbed . But in the primitive period , when a vast uninhabited region stretched before them , it would be easy for them to find some sheltered nook or fruitful valley . . . . If under such circum-stances disease or the casualties of a hunter 's life should carry off the parents , the survival of the children would , it is evident , depend mainly upon the nature of the climate and the ease with which food could be procured at all seasons of the year . In ancient Europe , after the present climatal conditions were estab-lished , it is doubtful if a family of children under ten years of age could have lived through a single winter . We are not , therefore , surprised to find that no more than four or five language stocks are represented in Europe . . . . Of Northern America , east of the Rocky Mountains and north of the tropics , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one region where Nature seems to offer herself as the willing nurse and bountiful stepmother of the feeble and unprotected . . . California . Its wonderful climate ( follows a long description ) . . . . Need we wonder that , in such a mild and fruitful region , a great number of separate tribes were found , speaking languages which a careful investigation has classed in nineteen distinct linguistic stocks ? " In Oregon , and in the interior of Brazil , Hale finds similar climatic conditions with the same result , a great number of totally dissimilar lan-guages , while in Australia , whose climate is as mild as that of any of these regions , we find hundreds , perhaps thousands , of petty tribes , as completely isolated as those of South America , but all speaking languages of the same stock ? because " the other conditions are such as would make it impossible for an isolated group of young children to survive . The whole of Australia is subject to severe droughts , and is so scantily provided with edible products that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , then , is Hate 's theory . Let us now look a little closer into the proofs adduced . They are , as it will be seen , of a twofold order . He invokes the language-creating tendencies of young children on the one hand , and on the other the geographical distribution of linguistic stocks or genera . As to the first , it is true that so competent a psychologist as Wundt denies the possibility in very strong terms.l But facts certainly do not justify this foregone conclusion . I must first refer the reader to Hale 's own report of the five instances known // to him . Unfortunately , the linguistic material collected by him is so scanty that we can form only a very imperfect idea of the languages which he says children have developed and of the relation between them and the language of the parents . But otherwise his report is very instructive , and I shall call special attention to the fact that in most cases the children seem to have been spoilt ' by their parents ; this is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it does not appear from Hale 's own extracts from the book in which he found his facts ( G. Watson , Universe of Language , N.Y. , 1878 ) . The only word recorded in this case is ni-si-boo-a for carriage ' ; how that came into existence , I dare not conjecture ; but when it is said that the syllables of it were sometimes so repeated that they made a much longer word , this agrees very well with what I have myself observed with regard to ordinary children 's playful word-coinages . In the next case , described by E. R. Hun , M.D. , of Albany , more words are given . Some of these bear a strong resemblance to French , although neither the parents nor servants spoke that language ; and Hale thinks that some person may have " amused herself , innocently enough , by teaching the child a few words of that tongue . " This , however , does not seem necessary to explain the words recorded . Feu , pronounced , we are told , like the French word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it may be either E. fire or else an imitation of the sound fff without a vowel , or fa. used in blowing out a candle or a match or in smoking , so as to amuse the child , exactly as in the case of one of my little Danish friends , who used fff as the name for smoke , steam , ' and later for funnel , chimney , ' and finally anything standing upright against the sky , for instance , a flagstaff . Petee-petee , the name which the Albany girl gave to her brother , and which Dr. Hun derived from F. petit , may be just as well from E. pet or petty ; and to explain her word for I , ' ma , we need not go to F. moi , as E. me or my may obviously be thus distorted by any child Her word for not ' is said to have been ne-pas , though the exact pronunciation is not given . This can not have been taken from the French , at any rate not from real French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ne is more often than not prouounced without the vowel or omitted altogether ; the girl 's word , if pronounced something like mnepa ? may be nothing else than an imperfect childish pronunciation of never , cf. the negroes ' form nebber . Too , all , everything , ' of course resembles Fr. tout , but how should anyone have been able to teach this girl , who did not speak any intelligible language , a French word of this abstract character ? Some of the other words admit of a natural explanation from English : go-go , delicacy , as sugar , // candy or dessert , ' is probably goody-goody , or a reduplicated form of good ; deer , money , ' may be from dear , expensive ' ; odo , to send for , to go out , to take away , ' is evidently out , as in ma odo , I want to go out ' ; gain , God , ' must be the English word , in spite of the difference in pronunication , for the child would never think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to go to sleep , pillow , bed , ' is from by-bye or an independent word of the mamma-class ; mea , cat , fur , ' of course is imitative of the sound of the cat . For the rest of the words I have no conjectures to offer . Some of the derived meanings are curious , though perhaps not more startling than many found in the speech of ordinary children ; papa and mamma separately had their usual signification , but papa-mamma meant church , prayer-book , cross , priest ' : the parents were punctual in church observances ; gar odo , horse out , to send for the horse , ' came to mean pencil and paper , ' as the father used , when the carriage was wanted , to write an order and send it to the stable . In the remaining three cases of invented ' languages no specimens are given , except shindikik , cat . ' In all cases the children seem to have talked together fluently when by themselves in their own gibberish . But there exists on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely that of the Icelandic girl Seeunn . ( See Jonasson and Eschricht in Dansk Maanedsslcriftt , Copenhagen , 1858 . ) She was born in the beginning of the last century on a farm in Hunavatns-syssel in the northern part of Iceland , and began early to converse with her twin brother in a language that was entirely unintelligible to their surroundings . Her parents were disquieted , and therefore resolved to send away the brother , who died soon afterwards . They now tried to teach the girl Icelandic , but soon ( too soon , evidently ! ) came to the conclusion that she could not learn it , and then they were foolish enough to learn her language , as did also her brothers and sisters and even some of their friends . In order that she might be confirmed , her elder brother translated the catechism and acted as interpreter between the parson and the girl . She is described as intelligent ? she even composed poetry in her own language ? but shy and distrustful . Jonasson gives a few specimens of her language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Icelandic words , though strangely disfigured . The language to Jonasson , who had heard it , seemed totally dissimilar to Icelandic in sounds and construction ; it had no flexions , and lacked pronouns . The vocabulary was so limited that she very often had to supplement a phrase by means of nods or gestures ; and it was difficult to carry on a conversation with her in the dark . The ingenuity of some of the compounds and metaphors is greatly admired by // Jonasson , though to the more sober mind of Eschricht they appear rather childish or primitive , as when a wether ' is called mepok-ill from me ( imitation of the sound ) + pok , a little bag ' ( Icel. poki ) + ill , to cut . ' The only complete sentence recorded is Dirfa offo nonona uhuh , ' which means : Sigurdur gets up extremely late . ' In his analysis of the whole case Eschricht succeeds in stripping it of the mystical glamour in which it evidently appeared to Jonasson as well as to the girl 's relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had persisted in only talking Icelandic to her , she would soon have forgotten her own language ; he compares her words with some strange disfigurements of Danish which he had observed among children in his own family and acquaintanceship . I read this report a good many years ago , and afterwards I tried on two occasions to obtain precise information about similar cases I had seen mentioned , one in Halland ( Sweden ) and the other in Finland , but without success . But in 1903 , when I was lecturing on the language of children in the University of Copenhagen , I had the good fortune to hear of a case not far from Copenhagen of two children speaking a language of their own . I investigated the case as well as I could , by seeing and hearing them several times and thus checking the words and sentences which their teacher , who was constantly with them , kindly took down in accordance with my directions . I am thus enabled to give a fairly full account of their language , though unfortunately my investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys were twins , about five and a half years old when I saw them , and so alike that even the people who were about them every day had difficulty in distinguishing them from each other . Their mother ( a single woman ) neglected them shamefully when they were quite small , and they were left very much to shift for themselves . For a long time , while their mother was ill in a hospital , they lived in an out-of-the-way place with an old woman , who is said to have been very deaf , and who at any rate troubled herself very little about them . When they were four years old , the parish authorities discovered how sadly neglected they were and that they spoke quite unintelligibly , and therefore sent them to a children 's home ' in Seeland , where they were properly taken care of . At first they were extremely shy and reticent , and it was a long time before they felt at home with the other children . When I first saw them , they had in so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many everyday sentences spoken to them , and could do what they were told ( e.g. Take the footstool and put it in my room near the stove ' ) , but they could not speak Danish and said very little // in the presence of anybody else . When they were by themselves they conversed pretty freely and in a completely unintelligible gibberish , as I had the opportunity to convince myself when standing behind a door one day when they thought they were not observed . Afterwards I got to be in a way good friends with them ? they called me py-ma , py being their word for smoke , smoking , pipe , cigar , ' so that I got my name from the chocolate cigars which I used to ingratiate myself with them ? and then I got them to repeat words and phrases which their teacher had written out for me , and thus was enabled to write down everything phonetically . An analysis of the sounds occurring in their words showed me that their vocal organs were perfectly normal . Most of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a voiceless 1 , which does not occur in Danish , and which I write here lh , was a very frequent sound . This , combined with an inclination to make many words end in p , was enough to disguise words very effectually , as when sort ( black ) was made lhop . I shall give the children 's pronunciations of the names of some of their new playfellows , adding in brackets the Danish substratum : Thep ( Svend ) , lhip ( Vilhelm ) , lip ( Elisabeth ) , lop ( Charlotte ) , bap ( Mandse ) ; similarly the doctor was called dop . In many cases there was phonetic assimilation at a distance , as when milk ( milk ) was called bep , flower ( blomst ) bop , light ( lys ) lhylh , sugar ( sukker ) lholh , cold ( kulde ) lhylh , sometimes also ulh. bed ( seng ) scejs , fish ( fisk ) se-is . I subjoin a few complete sentences : nina enaj una enaj hcena mad enaj , we shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( kanin ) , enaj negation ( nej , no ) , repeated several times in each negative sentence , as in Old English and in Bantu languages , una young ( unge ) . Bap ep dop , Manche has broken the hobbyhorse , ' literally Mandse horse piece . ' Hoe is bov lhaih , brother 's trousers are wet , Maria , ' literally trousers Maria brother water . ' The words are put together without any flexions , and the wordorder is totally different from that of Danish . Only in one case was I unable to identify words that I understood either as little language ' forms of Danish words or else as sound-imitations ; but then it must be remembered that they spoke a good deal that neither I nor any of the people about them could make anything of . And then , unfortunately , when I began to study it , their language was already to a great extent humanized ' in comparison to what it was when they first came to the children 's home . In fact , I noticed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in some of the last sentences I have noted I even find the genitive case employed . // The idiom of these twins can not , of course , be called an independent , still less a complete or fully developed language ; but if they were able to produce something so different from the language spoken around them at the beginning of the twentieth century and in a civilized country , there can to my mind be no doubt that Hale is right in his contention that children left to themselves even more than these were , in an uninhabited region where they were still not liable to die from hunger or cold , would be able to develop a language for their mutual understanding that might become so different from that of their parents as really to constitute a new stock of language . So that we can now pass to the other ? geographical ? side of what Hale advances in favour of his theory . So far as I can see , the facts here tally very well with the theory . Take , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishingly little variation from the east coast of Greenland to Alaska , an immense stretch of territory in which small children if left to themselves would be sure to die very soon indeed . Or take the Finnish-Ugrian languages in the other hemisphere , exhibiting a similar close relationship , though spread over wide areas . And then , on the other hand , the American languages already adduced by Hale . I do not pretend to any deeper knowledge of these languages ; but from the most recent works of very able specialists I gather an impression of the utmost variety in phonetics , in grammatical structure and in vocabulary ; see especially Roland B. Dixon and Alfred L. Kroeber , " The Native Languages of California , " in the American Anthropologist , 1903 . Even where recent research seems to establish some kind of kinship between families hitherto considered as distinguished stocks ( as in Dixon 's interesting paper , " Linguistic Relationships within the Shasta-Achomawi Stock , " XV Congres des Americanistes , 1906 ) the similarities are still so incomplete , so capricious and generally so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a gradual splitting of the usual kind . As for Brazil , I shall quote some interesting remarks from C. F. P. v. Martius , Beitrage zur Ethnographic u . Sprachenkunde Ameri/ca 's , 1867 , i. p. 46 : " In Brazil we see a scant and unevenly distributed native population , uniform in bodily structure , temperament , customs and manner of living generally , but presenting a really astonishing diversity in language . A language is often confined to a few mutually related individuals ; it is in truth a family heirloom and isolates its speakers from all other people so as to render any attempt at understanding impossible . On the vessel in which we travelled up the rivers in the interior of Brazil , we often , among twenty Indian rowers , could count only // three or four that were at all able to speak together . . . they at there side by side dumb and stupid . " Hale 's theory is worthy , then , of consideration , and now , at the close of our voyage round the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vantage from which we can overlook the whole globe and see that the peculiar word-forms which children use in their little language ' period can actually throw light on the distribution of languages and groups of languages over the great continents . Yes , Scorn not the little ones ! You oft will find They reach the goal , when great ones lag behind . BOOK III THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE WORLD XI. ? ? 1 . The Substratum Theory . IT seems evident that if we wish to find out the causes of linguistic change , a fundamental division must be into Changes that are due to the transference of the language to new individuals , and Changes that are independent of such transference . It may not be easy in practice to distinguish the two classes , as the very essence of the linguistic life of each individual is a continual give-and-take between him and those around him ; still , the division is in the main clear , and will consequently be followed in the present work . The first class falls again naturally into two heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , possess a language . With the former , i.e. with the native child learning his mother-tongue , ' we have dealt at length in Book II , and we now proceed to an examination of the influence exercised on a language through its transference to individuals who are already in possession of another language ? let us , for the sake of shortness , call them foreigners . While some earlier scholars denied categorically the existence of mixed languages , recent investigators have attached a very great importance to mixtures of languages , and have studied actually occurring mixtures of various degrees and characters with the greatest accuracy : I mention here only one name , that of Hugo Schuchardt , who combines profundity and width of knowledge with a truly philosophical spirit , though the form of his numerous scattered writings makes it difficult to gather a just idea of his views on many questions . Many scholars have recently attached great importance to the subtler and more hidden influence exerted by one language on another in those cases in which a population abandons its originL : i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally in consequence of military conquest . In these cases the theory is that people keep many of their speech-habits , especially with regard to articulation and accent , even while using the vocabulary , etc. , of the new language , which thus to a large extent is tinged by the old language . There is thus created what is now generally termed a substratum underlying the new language . As the original substratum modifying a language which gradually spreads over a large area varies according to the character of the tribes subjugated in different districts , this would account for many of those splittings-up of languages which we witness everywhere . Hirt goes so far as to think it possible by the help of existing dialect boundaries to determine the extensions of aboriginal languages ( Idg 19 ) . There is certainly something very plausible in this manner of viewing linguistic changes , for we all know from practical everyday experience that the average foreigner is apt to betray his nationality as soon as he opens his mouth : the Italian 's or the German 's English is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Englishman 's Italian or German is different from the Italian or German of a native : the place of articulation , especially that of the tongue-tip consonants , the aspiration or want of aspiration of p , t , k , the voicing or non-voicing of b , d , g , the diphthongization or mono phthongization of long vowels , the syllabification , various peculiarities in quantity and in tone-movements ? all such things are apt to colour the whole acoustic impression of a foreigner 's speech in an acquired language , and it is , of course , a natural supposition that the aboriginal inhabitants of Europe and Asia were just as liable to transfer their speech habits to new languages as their descendants are nowadays . There is thus a priori a strong probability that linguistic substrata have exercised some influence on the development of conquering languages . But when we proceed to apply this natural inference to concrete examples of linguistic history , we shall see that the theory does not perhaps suffice to explain everything that its advocates would have it explain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced or appraised according to their real value . A consideration of these concrete examples will naturally lead up to a discussion of the general principles involved in the substratum theory . XI. ? ? 2 . French u and Spanish h . First I shall mention . Aseoli 's famous theory that French y for Latin u , as in dur , etc. , is due to Gallic influence , cf. Welsh i in din from dun , which presupposes a transition from u to y. // Ascoli found a proof in the fact that Dutch also has the pronuncia-tion y , e.g. in duur , on the old Keltic soil of the Belgae , to which Schuchardt ( S1D 126 ) added his observation of y in dialectal South German ( Breisgau ) , in a district in which there had formerly been a strong Keltic element . This looks very convincing at first blush . On closer inspection , doubts arise on many points . The French transition can not with certainty be dated very early , for then c in cure would have been palatalized and changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; also the treatment of the vowel in French words taken over into English , where it is not identified with the native y , but becomes ill , is best explained on the as-sumption that about 1200 A.D. the sound had not advanced farther on its march towards the front position than , say , the Swedish mixed-round ' sound in hus . The district in which y is found for u is not coextensive with the Keltic possessions ; there were very few Kelts in what is now Holland , and inversely South German y for u does not cover the whole Keltic domain ; y is found outside the French territory proper , namely , in Franco-Provencal ( where the substratum was Ligurian ) and in Provencal ( where there were very few Galli ; cf. Wechssler , L 113 ) . Thus the province of y is here too small and there too large to make the argument conclusive . Even more fatal is the objection that the Gallic transition from u to y is very uncertain ( Pedersen , GKS 1 . ? 353 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u was not a common Keltic transition , for it is not found in the Gaelic ( Goidelic ) branch . ' On the other hand , the transition from u to y occurs elsewhere , independent of Keltic influence , as in Old Greek ( cf. also the Swedish sound in hus ) : why can not it , then , be independent in French ? Another case adduced by Ascoli is initial h instead of Latin f in the country anciently occupied by the Iberians . Now , Basque has no f sound at all in any connexion ; if the same aversion to f had been the cause of the Spanish substitution of h for f , we should expect the substitution to have been made from the moment when Latin was first spoken in Hispania , and we should expect it to be found in all positions and connexions . But what do we find instead ? First , that Old Spanish had f in many cases where modern Spanish has h ( i.e. really no sound at all ) , and this can not be 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , the transition f h seems to have taken place many centuries after the Roman invasion , since the Spanish-speaking Jews of Salonika , who emigrated from Spain about 1500 , have to this day preserved the f sound among other archaic traits ( see F. Hanssen , Span . Gramm. 45 ' Wiener , Modern Philology , June 1903 , p. 205 ) . And secondly , that f has been kept in certain connexions ; thus , before w , as in fui , fuiste , fug , etc. , before r and 1 , as in fruto , for , etc . This certainly is inexplicable if the cause of f h had been the want of power on the part of the aborigines to produce the f sound at all , while it is simple enough if we assume a later transition , taking place possibly at first between two vowels , with a subsequent generalization of the f-less forms . Diez is here , as not infrequently , more sensible than some of his successors ( see Gramm. d. roman . spr. , 4th ed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XI. ? ? 3 . Gothonic and Keltic . Feist ( KI 480 ff . ; cf. PBB 36. 307 if. , 37. 112 ff. ) applies the substratum theory to the Gothonic ( Germanic ) languages . The Gothons are autochthonous in northern Europe , and very little mixed with other races ; they must have immigrated just after the close of the glacial period . But the arrival of Aryan ( Indogermanic ) tribes can not be placed earlier than about 2000 B.C. ; they made the original inhabitants give up their own language . The nation that thus Aryanized the Gothons can not have been other than the Kelts ; their supremacy over the Gothons is proved by several loan-words for cultural ideas or state offices , such as Gothic reiks king , ' andbahts servant . ' The Aryan language which the Kelts taught the Gothons was subjected in the process to considerable changes , the old North Europeans pronouncing the new language in accordance with their previous speech habits ; instead of taking over the free Aryan accent , they invariably stressed the initial syllable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The theory does not bear close inspection . The number of Keltic loan-words is not great enough for us to infer such an overpowering ascendancy on the part of the Kelts as would force the subjected population to make a complete surrender of their own tongue . Neither in number nor in intrinsic significance can these loans be compared with the French loans in English : and yet the Normans did not succeed in substituting their own language for English . Besides , if the theory were true , we should not merely see a certain number of Keltic loan-words , but the whole speech , the complete vocabulary as well as the entire grammar , would be Keltic ; yet as a matter of fact there is a wide gulf between Keltic // and Gothonic , and many details , lexical and grammatical , in the latter group resemble other Aryan languages rather than Keltic . The stressing of the first syllable is said to be due to the aboriginal language . If that were so , it would mean that this population , in adopting the new speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first syllable to all the new words , very much as Icelanders are apt to do nowadays . But this is not in accordance with well established facts in the Gothonic languages : we know that when the consonant shift took place , it found the stress on the same syllables as in Sanskrit , and that it was this stress on many middle or final syllables that afterwards changed many of the shifted consonants from voiceless to voiced ( Verner 's law ) . ' This fact in itself suffices to prove that the consonant shift and the stress shift can not have taken place simultaneously , and thus can not be due to one and the same cause , as supposed by Feist . Nor can the havoc wrought in the old flexions be due to the inability of a new people to grasp the minute nuances and intricate system of another language than its own ; for in that case too we should have some-thing like the formless Pidgin English ' from the very beginning , whereas the oldest Gothonic languages still preserve a great many old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a matter of fact , many of the flexions of primitive Aryan were much better preserved in Gothonic languages than in Keltic . XI. ? ? 4 . Etruscan and Indian Consonants . In another place in the same work ( KI 373 ) Feist speaks of the Etruscan language , and says that this had only one kind of stop consonants , represented by the letters k ( c ) , t , p , besides the aspirated stops kh , th , ph , which in some instances correspond to Latin and Greek tenues . This , he says , reminds one very strongly of the sound system of High German ( oberdeutschen ) dialects , and more particularly of those spoken in the Alps . Feist here ( and in PBB 36. 340 ff. ) maintains that these sounds go back to a Pre-Gothonic Alpine population , which he identifies with the ancient Rh ntians ; and he sees in this a strong support of a linguistic connexion between the Rhaetians and Etruscans . He finds further striking analogies between the Gothonic and the Armenian sound systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etruscan , in the domain of the ancient Rhaetians and in Asia Minor is accordingly ascribed to the speech habits of one and the same aboriginal race . // Here , too , there are many points to which I must take exception . It is not quite certain that the usual interpretation of Etruscan letters is correct ; in fact , much may be said in favour of the hypothesis that the letters rendered p , t , k stand really for the sounds of b , d , g , and that those transcribed ph , th , kh ( or Greek c , 0 , X ) represent ordinary p , t , k . However this may be , Feist seems to be speaking here almost in the same breath of the first ( or common Gothonic ) shift and of the second ( or specially High German ) shift , although they are separated from each other by several centuries and neither cover the same geographical ground nor lead to the same phonetic result . Neither Armenian nor primitive Gothonic can be said to be averse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b , d , g for the old ' media- , aspiratae . ' And in both languages the old voiceless stops became at first probably not aspirates , but simply voiceless spirants , as in English father , thing , and Scotch loch . Further , it should be noted that we do not find the tendency to unvoice stops and to pronounce affricates either in Rhaeto-Romanic ( Ladin ) or in Tuscan Italian ; both languages have unaspirated p , t , k and voiced b , d , g , and the Tuscan pronunciation of c between two vowels as x , thus in la Casa la xa ? sa , but not in a cases = akka ? sa , could not be termed aspiration ' except by a non-phonetician ; this pronunciation can hardly have anything to do with the old Etruscan language . According to a theory which is very widely accepted , the Dravidian languages exerted a different influence on the Aryan languages when the Aryans first set foot on Indian soil , in making them adopt the cacuminal ' ( or ' inverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and th , which were not found in primitive Aryan . But even this theory does not seem to be quite proof against objections . It is easy to admit that natives accustomed to one place of articulation of their d , t , n will unconsciously produce the d , t , n of a new language they are learning in the same place ; but then they will do it everywhere . Here , however , both Dravidian and Sanskrit possess pure dental d , t , n , pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the upper teeth , besides cacuminal d , in which it touches the gum or front part of the hard palate . In Sanskrit we find that the cacuminal articulation occurs only under very definite conditions , chiefly under the influence of r . Now , a trilled tongue-point r in most languages , for purely physiological reasons which are easily accounted for , tends to be pronounced further back than ordinary denials ; and it is therefore quite natural that it should spontaneously exercise an influence on neighbouring dentals by drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have happened in India quite independently of the occurrence of the same sounds in other vernaculars , just as we find ? 4 ETRUSCAN AND INDIAN CONSONANTS 197 the same influence very pronouncedly in Swedish and in East Norwegian , where d , t , n , 8 are cacuminal ( supradental ) in such words as bord , kort , barn , forst , etc . According to Grandgent ( Neuere Sprachen , 2. 447 ) , d in his own American English is pronounced further back than elsewhere before and after r , as in dry , hard ; but in none of these cases need we conjure up an extinct native population to account for a perfectly natural development . XI. ? ? 5 . Gothonic Sound-shift . Since the time of Grimm the Gothonic consonant changes have harassed the minds of linguists ; they became the sound-shift and were considered as something sui generis , something out of the common , which required a different explanation from all other sound-shifts . Several explanations have been offered , to some of which we shall have to revert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that which attributes the shift to an ethnic substratum . This explanation is accepted by Hirt , Feist , MeiIlet and others , though their agreement ceases when the question is asked : What nationality and what language can have been the cause of the change ? While some cautiously content themselves with saying that there must have been an original population , others guess at Kelts , Finns , Rhaetian or Etrurians ? all fascinating names to minds of a speculative turn . The latest treatment of the question that I have seen is by K. Wessely ( in Anthropos , XII ? XIII 540 ff. , 1917 ) . He assumes the following different substrata , beginning with the most recent : a Rhaeto-Romanic for the Upper-German shift , a Keltic for the common High-German-.aWft , . - and.a Finnic for the first Germanic shift with the Vernerian law . This certainly has the merit of neatly separating sound-shifts that are chronologically apart , except with regard to the last-mentioned shift , for here the Finns are made responsible for two changes that were probably separated by - centuries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the transition from p to f and from t to p ? both important elements of the first shift ? here ascribed to Finnic , for as a matter of fact the two sounds f and p are not found in present-day Finnish , and were not found in primitive Ugro-Finnic. ' // When Wessely thinks that the charge discovered by Verner is also due to Finnic influence , his reasons are two : an alleged parallelism with the Finnic consonant change which he terms Setala 's law , ' and then the assumption that such a shift , conditioned by the place of the accent , is foreign to the Aryan race ( p. 543 ) . When , however , we find a closely analogous case only four hundred years ago in English , where a number of consonants were voiced according to the place of the stress , l are we also to say that it is foreign to the Anglo-Saxon race and therefore presupposes some non-Aryan substratum 1 As a matter of fact , the parallelism between the English and the old Gothonic shift is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consonant-gradation : in English and in old Gothonic the stress place is decisive , while in the Finnic shift it is very doubtful whether stress goes for any-thing ; in both English and old Gothonic the same consonants are affected ( spirants , in English also the combinations tf , ks , but otherwise no stops ) , while in Finnic it is the stops that are primarily affected . In old Gothonic , as in English , the change is simply voicing , and we have nothing corresponding to the reduction of double consonants and of consonant groups in Finnic pappi / papin , ottaa / otat , kukka / kukan , parempi / paremman , jalka / jalan , etc . On the whole , Wessely 's paper shows how much easier it is to advance hypotheses than to find truths . XI. ? ? 6 . Natural and Specific Changes . Meillet ( MSL 19. 164 and 172 ; cf. Bulletin 19. 59 and Germ. 18 ) thinks that we must distinguish between such phonetic changes as are natural , i.e. due to universal tendencies , and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class he includes the opening and the voicing of intervocalic consonants ; there is also a natural and universal tendency to shorten long words and to slur the pronunciation towards the end of a word . In the latter class ( changes which are peculiar to and characteristic of a particular language ) he reckons the consonant shifts in Gothonic and Armenian , the weakening of consonants in Greek and in Iranian , the tendency to unround back vowels in English and Slay . Such changes can only be accounted for on the supposition of a change of language : they must be due to people whose own language had habits foreign to Aryan . Unfortunately , Meillet can not tell us how to measure the difference between natural and // peculiar shifts he admits that they can not always be clearly separated ; and when he says that there are some extreme cases relativement nets , ' such as those named above , I must confess that I do not sec ; why the change from the sharp tennis , as in Fr. p , t , k , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19. 50 ) , 1 or the relaxing of the closure which finally led to the sounds of f , p , x , should be less ' natural ' than a hundred other changes and should require the calling in of a dens ex machina in the shape of an aboriginal population . The unrounding of E. u in hut , etc. , to which he alludes , began about 1600 ? what ethnic substratum does that postulate , and is any such required , more than for , say , the diphthougizing of long a and o ? Meillet ( MSL 19. 172 ) also says that there are certain speech sounds which are , as it were , natural and are found in nearly all languages , thus p , t , k , n , m , and among the vowels a , i , u , while other sounds are found only in some languages , such as the two English th sounds or , among the vowels , Fr. u and Russian y . But when he infers that sounds of the former class are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter are apt to change and disappear , the conclusion is not borne out by actual facts . The consonants p , t , k , n , rn are said to have remained unchanged in many Aryan languages from the oldest times till the present day ? that is , only initially before vowels , which is a very important reservation and really amounts to an admission that in the vast majority of cases these sounds are just as unstable as most other things on this planet , especially if we remember that nothing could well be more unstable than k before front vowels , as seen in It . tf and Sp. p in cielo , I'r. s in ciel , and f in chien , Eng . and Swedish tf in chin , kind , Norwegian e in kind , Russian t f in cetyre four ' and s in sto ' hundred , ' etc . As an example of a typically unstable sound Meillet gives bilabial f , and it is true that this sound is so rare that it is difficult to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the upper teeth normally protrude above the lower jaw , and that consequently the lower lip articulates easily against the upper teeth , with the natural result that where we should theoretically expect the bilabial f the labiodental f takes its place . And , s , which is found almost universally , and should therefore on 111eillet 's theory be very stable , is often seen to change into h or x or to disappear . On the whole , then , we see that it is not the naturalness ' or universality of a // consonant so much as its position in the syllable and word that decides the question change or no change . ' The relation between stability and naturalness is seen , perhaps , most clearly in such an instance as long a ? : this sound is so natural that English , from the oldest Aryan to present-day speech , has never been without it ; yet at no time has it been stable , but as soon as one class of words with long a ? is changed , a new class steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now mother ; ( 2 ) lengthening of a short a before n : gas , brahta , now goose , brought ; ( 3 ) levelling of ai : shin , now stone ; ( 4 ) lengthening of short a : cald , now cold ; ( 5 ) later lengthening of a in open syllable : name , now neim ; ( 6 ) mod. carve , calm , path and others from various sources ; and ( 7 ) vulgar speech is now developing new levellings of diphthongs in mad , pa ? ( e ) for mile , power . XI. ? ? 7 . Power of Substratum . V. Brondal has made the attempt to infuse new blood into the substratum theory through his book , Substrater og Laan i Romansk og Germansk ( Copenhagen , 1917 ) . The effect of a substratum , according to him , is the establishment of a constant idiom , ' working " without regard to place and time " ( p. 76 ) and changing , for instance , Latin into Old French , Old French into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His task , then , is to find out certain tendencies operating at these various periods ; these are ascribed to the Keltic substratum , and Brondal then passes in review a great many languages spoken in districts where Kelts are known to have lived in former times , in order to find the same tendencies there . If he succeeds in this to his own satisfaction , it is only because the tendencies ' established are partly so vague that they will fit into any language , partly so ill-defined phonetically that it becomes possible to press different , nay , in some eases even directly contrary movements into the same class . But considerations of space forbid me to enter on a detailed criticism here . I must content myself with taking exception to the principle that the effect of - the ethnic substratum may show itself several generations after the speech substitution took place . If Keltic ever had a finger in the pie , ' it must have been immediately on the taking over of the new language . An influence exerted in such a time of transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is not the same thing as asserting that a similar modification of the language may take place after the lapse of some centuries as an effect of the same cause , Suppose we have a series of manuscripts , A , B , C , D , etc. , of which R is copied from A , C from B , // etc. , and that B has an error which is repeated in all the following copies ; now , if Ni suddenly agrees with A ( which the copyist has never seen ) , we infer that this reading is independent of A. In the same way with a language : each individual learns it from his contemporaries , but has no opportunity of hearing those who have died before his own time . It is possible that the transition from a to ce in Old English ( as in feeder ) is due to Keltic influence , but when we find , many centuries later , that a is changed into ae ( the present sound ) in words which had not ce in OE. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to ascribe this , as Brondal does , to a constant Keltic idiom ' working through many generations who had never spoken or heard any Keltic . Atavism , ' which skips over one or more generations , is unthinkable here , for words and sounds are nothing but habits acquired by imitation . So far , then , our discussion of the substratum theory has brought us no very positive results . One of the reasons why the theories put forward of late years havebeen on the whole so unsatisfactory is that they deal with speech substitutions that have taken place so far back that absolutely nothing , or practically nothing , is known of those displaced languages which are supposed to have coloured languages now existing . What do we know beyond the mere name of Ligurians or Veneti or Iberians ? Of the Pre-Germanic and Pre-Keltic peoples we know not even the names . As to the old Kelts who play such an eminent r8le in all these speculations , we know extremely little about their language at this distant date , and it is possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been only comparatively small armies conquering this or that country for a time , but leaving as few linguistic traces behind them as , say , the armies of Napoleon in Russia or the Cimbri and Teutoni in Italy . Linguists have turned from the glottogonic ' speculations of Bopp and his disciples , only to indulge in dialectogonic speculations of exactly the same visionary type . XI. ? ? 8 . Types of Race-mixture . It would be a great mistake to suppose that the conditions , and consequently the linguistic results , are always the same , whenever two different races meet and assimilate . The chief classes of race-mixture have been thus described in a valuable paper by George Hempl ( Transactions of he American Philological Association , XXIX , p. 31 if. , 1898 ) . ( 1 ) The conquerors are a comparatively small body , who become the ruling class , but are not numerous enough to impose their language on the country . They are forced to learn the language of their subjects , and their grandchildren may come to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors . The language of the conquerors dies out , but bequeaths to the native language its terms pertaining to government , the army , and those other spheres of life that the conquerors had specially under their control . Historic examples are the cases of the Goths in Italy and Spain , the Franks in Gaul , the Normans in France and the Norman-French in England . Of course , the greater the number of the conquerors and the longer they had been close neighbours of the people they conquered , or maintained the bonds that united them to their mother-country , the greater was their influence . Thus the influence of the Franks on the language of France was greater than that of the Goths on the language of Spain , and the influence of the Norman-French in England was greater still . Yet in each case the minority ultimately succumbed . ( 2a ) The conquest is made by many bodies of invaders , who bring with them their whole households and are followed for a long period of time by similar hordes of their kinsmen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lower classes of the new community . The natives recede before the conquerors or become their slaves : their speech is regarded as servile and is soon laid aside , except for a few terms pertaining to the humbler callings , the names of things peculiar to the country and place-names . Examples : Angles and Saxons in Britain and Europeans in Am rica and Australia , though in the last case we can hardly speak of race-mixture between the natives and the immigrants . ( 2b ) A more powerful nation conquers the people and annexes its territory , which is made a province , to which not only governors and soldiers , but also merchants and even colonists are sent . These become the upper class and the influential part of the middle class . If centuries pass and the province is still subjected to the direct influence of the ruling country , it will more and more imitate the speech and the habits and customs of that country . Such was the history of Italy , Spain and Gaul under the Romans ; similar , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the Dutch in New York State ; such is the process going on to-day among the French in Louisiana and among the Germans in their original settlements in Pennsylvania . ( 3 ) Immigrants come in scattered bands and at different times ; they become servants or follow other humble callings . It is usually not to their advantage to associate with their fellowcountrymen , but rather to mingle with the native population . The better they learn to speak the native tongue , the faster they get on in the world . If their children in their dross or speech betray their foreign origin , they are ridiculed as Dutch ' or Irish , // or whatever it may be . They therefore take pains to rid themselves of all traces of their alien origin and avoid using the speech of their parents . In this way vast numbers of newcomers may be assimilated year by year till they constitute a large part of the new race , while their language makes practically no impression on the language of the country . This is the story of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day . It will be seen that in classes 1 and 3 the speech of the natives prevails , while in the two classes comprised under 2 it is that of the conqueror which eventually triumphs . Further , that , in all cases except type 2b , that language prevails which is spoken by what is at the time the majority . Sound substitution is found in class 3 in the case of foreigners who come to America after they have learnt to speak , and of the children of foreigners who keep up their original language at home . If , however , while they are still young , they are chiefly thrown with English-speaking people , they usually gain a thorough mastery of the English language ; thus most of the children , and practically all of the grandchildren , of immigrants , by the time they are grownup , speak English without foreign taint . Their origin has thin no permanent influence on their adopted language . The same thing is true when a small ruling minority drops its foreign speech and learns that of the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2a ) when a native minority succumbs to a foreign majority , though here the ultimate language may be slightly influenced by the native dialect . It is different with class 2b : when a whole population comes in the course of centuries to surrender its natural speech for that of a ruling minority , sound substitution plays an important part , and to a great extent determines the character and future of the language . HempI here agrees with Hirt in seeing in this fact the explanation of much ( N.B. not all ! ) of the difference between the Romanic languages and of the difference between natural High German and High German spoken in Low German territory , and he is therefore not surprised when he is told by Nissen that the dialects of modern Italy correspond geographically pretty closely to the non-Latin languages once spoken in the Peninsula . But he severely criticizes Hirt for going so far as to explain the differentiation of Aryan speech by the theory of sound substitution . Hirt assumes conditions like those in class 1 , and yet thinks that the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to Hirt 's theory that the conquering bodies of Indo-Europeans should be small compared with the number of the people they conquered . . . . If we wish to prove that the differentiation of Indo-European speech was like the differentiation of Romance speech , we must // be able to show that the conditions under which the differentiations took place were alike or equivalent . But even a cursory examination of the manner in which the Romance countries were Romanized .. . will make it clear that no parallel could possibly be drawn between the conditions under which the Romance languages arose and those that we can suppose to have existed while the Indo-European languages took shape . " Hempl also criticizes the way in which the Germanic consonant-shift is supposed by Hirt to be due to sound-substitution : when instead of the original t th d dh Germanic has p P t 5 , these latter sounds , on Hirt 's theory , must be either the native sounds that the conquered people substituted for the original sounds , or else they have developed out of such sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we ask ourselves why the conquered people did not use their t for the Indo-European t , instead of substituting it for d , and then substituting p for the Indo-European t . If the second supposition be true , the native population introduced into the language sounds very similar to the original t , th , d , dh , and all the change from that slightly variant form to the one that we find in Germanic was of subsequent development ? and must be explained by the usual methods after all . I have dwelt so long on Hempl 's paper because , in spite of its ( to my mind ) fundamental importance , it has been generally overlooked by supporters of the substratum theory . To construct a true theory , it will be necessary to examine the largest possible number of facts with regard to race-mixture capable of being tested by scientific methods . In this connexion the observations of Lenz in South America and of Puscariu in Rumania are especially valuable . The former found that the Spanish spoken in Chile was greatly influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Zeitschr. f. roman . Philologie , 17. 188 if. , 1893 ) . Now , what were the facts in regard to the population speaking this language ? The immigrants were chiefly men , who in many cases necessarily married native women and left the care of their children to a great extent in the hands of Indian servants . As the natives were more warlike than in many other parts of South America , there was for a very long time a continuous influx of Spanish soldiers , many of whom , after a short time , settled down peacefully in the country . More Spanish soldiers , indeed , arrived in Chile in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries than in the whole of the rest of // South America . Accordingly , by the beginning of the eighteenth century the Indians had been either driven back or else assimilated , and at the beginning of the War of Liberation early in the nineteenth century Chile was the only State in which there was a uniform Spanish-speaking population . In the greater part of Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this population speaks nothing but Spanish , while in Peru and Bolivia nearly the whole rural population still speaks more or less exclusively Keshua or Aimara , and these languages are also used occasionally , or at any rate understood , by the whites . Chile is thus the only country in which a real Spanish people 's dialect could develop . ( In Hcmpl 's classification this would be a typical case of class 2a . ) In the other Spanish-American countries the Spanish-speakers are confined to the upper ruling class , there being practically no lower class with Spanish as its mothertongue , except in a couple of big cities . Thus we understand that the Peruvian who has learnt his Spanish at school has a purer Castilian pronunciation than the Chilean ; yet , apart from pronunciation , the educated Chilean 's Spanish is much more correct and fluent than that of the other South Americans , whose language is stiff and vocabulary scanty , because they have first learnt some Indian language in childhood . Lenz 's Chileans , who have often been invoked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve to show that sound substitution takes place only under certain well-defined conditions . Puscariu ( in Prinzipienfragen der romanischen S'prachwissenschaft , Beihefte zur Zschr , f. rm . Phil. , 1910 ) says that in a Saxon village which had been almost completely Rumanianized he had once talked for hours with a peasant without noticing that he was not a native Rumanian : he was , however , a Saxon , who spoke Saxon with his wife , but Rumanian with his son , because the latter language was easier to him , as he had acquired the Rumanian basis of articulation . Here , then , there was no sound substitution , and in general we may say that the less related two languages are , the fewer will be the traces of the original language left on the new language ( p. 49 ) . The reason must be that people who naturally speak a closely related language are easily understood even when their acquired speech has a tinge of dialect : there is thus no inducement for them to give up their pronunciation . Puscariu also found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself of his dialectal traits in Rumanian than to acquire a correct pronunciation of German or French . He therefore disbelieves in a direct influence exerted by the indigenous languages on the formation of the Romanic languages ( and thus goes much further than Hempl ) . All these languages , and particularly Rumanian , during // the first centuries of the Middle Ages underwent radical transformations not paralleled in the thousand years ensuing . This may have been partly due to an influence exerted by ethnic mixture on the whole character of the young nations and through that also on their language . But other factors have certainly also played an important r8le , especially the grouping round new centres with other political aims than those of ancient Rome , and consequent isolation from the rest of the Romanic peoples . Add to this the very important emancipation of the ordinary conversational language from the yoke of Latin . In the first Christian centuries the influence of Latin was so overpowering in official life and in the schools that it obstructed a natural development . But soon after the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke the power not only of Rome , but also of its language . The speech of the masses , which had been held in fetters for so long , now asserted itself in full freedom and with elemental violence , the result being those far-reaching changes by which the Romanic languages are marked off from Latin . Language and nation or race must not be confounded : witness Rumania , whose language shows very few dialectal variations , though the populations of its different provinces are ethnically quite distinct ( ib. p. 51 ) . XI. ? ? 9 . Summary . The general impression gathered from the preceding investigation must be that it is impossible to ascribe to an ethnic substratum all the changes and dialectal differentiations which some linguists explain as due to this sole cause . Many other influences must have been at work , among which an interruption of intercourse created by natural obstacles or social conditions of various kinds would be of prime importance . If we take ethnic substrata as the main or sole source of dialectal differentiation , it will be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iceland was very sparsely inhabited when the land-taking ' took place , and still harder to account for the very great divergences that we witness between the dialects spoken in the Faroe Islands . A mere turning over the leaves of Bennike ' and Kristensen 's maps of Danish dialects ( or the corresponding maps of France ) will show the impossibility of explaining the crisscross of boundaries of various phonetic phenomena as entirely due to ethnical differences in the aborigines . On the other hand , the speech of Russian peasants is said to be remarkably free from dialectal divergences , in spite of the fact that it has spread in comparatively recent times over districts inhabited by populations with // languages of totally different types ( Finnic , Turkish , Tataric ) . I thus incline to think that sound substitution can not have produced radical changes , but has only played a minor part in the development of languages . There are , perhaps , also interesting things to be learnt from . conditions in Finland . Here Swedish has for many centuries been the language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nineteenth century that Finnish attained to the dignity of a literary language . The sound systems of Swedish and Finnish are extremely unlike : Finnish lacks many of the Swedish sounds , such as b , d ( what is written d is either mute or else a kind of weak r ) , g and f . No word can begin with more than one consonant , consequently Swedish strand and skraddare , tailor , ' are represented in the form of the loan-words ranta and rcidt ili . Now , in spite of the fact that most Swedish-speaking people have probably spoken Finnish as children and have had Finnish servants and playfellows to teach them the language , none of these peculiarities have influenced their Swedish : what makes them recognizable as hailing from Finland ( finska brytningen ' ) is not simplification of consonant groups or substitution of p for b , etc. , but such small things as the omission of the compound tone , ' the tendency to lengthen the second consonant in groups like ns , and European ( back ' ) u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitution as a result of race-mixture and of conquest can not have played any very considerable part in the differentiation of languages as wholes , there is another domain in which sound substitution is very important , that is , in the shape which loan-words take in the languages into which they are introduced . H : ' wever good the pronunciation of the first introducer of a word may have been , it is clear that when a word is extensively used by people with no intimate and first-hand knowledge of the language from which it was taken , most of them will tend to pronounce it with the only sounds with which they are familiar , those of their own language . Thus we see that the English and Russians , who have no y in their own speech , substitute for it the combination ju , iu in recent loans from French Scandinavians have no voiced z and 3 and therefore , in such loans from French or English as kusine , budget , jockey , etc. , substitute the voiceless s and fj , or sj . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such words as bouquet , beau bu ? kei , bou , and will slur the r of such French words as boulevard , etc . The same transference of speech habits from one 's native language also affects such important things as quantity , stress and tone : the English have no final short stressed vowels , such as are found in bouquet , beau ; hence their tendency to lengthen as well as diphthongize // these sounds , while the French will stress the final syllable of recent loans , such as jury , reporter . These phenomena are so uni-versal and so well known that they need no further illustration . The more familiar such loan-words are , the more unnatural it would be to pronounce them with foreign sounds or according to foreign rules of quantity and stress ; for this means in each case a shunting of the whole speech-apparatus on to a different track for one or two words and then shifting back to the original basis of articulation ' ? an effort that many speakers are quite incapable of and one that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . XI. ? ? 10 . General Theory of Loan-words . In the last paragraphs we have already broached a very im-portant subject , that of loan-words.i No language is entirely free from borrowed words , because no nation has ever been com-pletely isolated . Contact with other nations inevitably leads to borrowings , though their number may vary very considerably . Here we meet with a fundamental principle , first formulated by E. Windisch ( in his paper " Zur Theorie der Mischsprachen and Lehnworter , " Verh. d. sachsischen Gesellsch. d . Wissensch. , XLIX , 1897 , p. 107 ff . ) : " It is not the foreign language a nation learns that turns into a mixed language , but its own native language becomes mixed under the influence of a foreign language . " When we try to learn and talk a foreign tongue we do not introduce into it words taken from our own language ; our endeavour will always be to speak the other language as purely as possible , and generally we are painfully conscious of every native word that we intrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thus avoid in speaking a foreign language we very often do in our own . Frederick the Great prided himself on his good French , and in his French writings we do not find a single German word , but whenever he wrote German his sentences were full of French words and phrases . This being the general practice , we now understand why so few Keltic words were taken over into French and English . There was nothing to induce the ruling classes to learn ? 10 GENERAL THEORY OF LOAN-WORDS 209 the language of the inferior natives : it could never be fashionable for them to show an acquaintance with a despised tongue by using now and then a Keltic word . On the other hand , the Kelt would have to learn the language of his masters , and learn it well ; and he would even among his comrades like to show off his knowledge by interlarding his speech with words and turns from the language of his betters . Loan-words always show a superiority of the nation from whose language they are borrowed , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , it need not be extensive : indeed , in some of the most typical cases it is of a very partial character and touches only on one very special point . I refer to those instances in which a district or a people is in possession of some special thing or product wanted by some other nation and not produced in that country . Here quite naturally the name used by the natives is taken over along with the thing . Obvious examples are the names of various drinks : wine is a loan from Latin , tea from Chinese , coffee from Arabic , chocolate from Mexican , and punch from I-Iindustani . A certain type of carriage was introduced about 1500 from Hungary and is known in most European languages by its Magyar name : E. coach , G. kutsche , etc . Moccasin is from Algonquin , bamboo from Malay , tulip and turban ( ultimately the same word ) from Persian . A slightly different case is when some previously unknown plant or animal is made known through some foreign nation , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chimpanzee from some African , and tapir from some Brazilian language . It is characteristic of all words of this kind that only a few of them are taken from each foreign language , and that they have nearly all of them gone the round of all civilized languages , so that they are now known practically all over the world . Other loan-words form larger groups and bear witness to the cultural superiority of some nation in some one specified sphere of activity or branch of knowledge : such are the Arabic words relating to mathematics and astronomy ( algebra , zero , cipher , azimuth , zenith , in related fields tariff , alkali , alcohol ) , the Italian words relating to music ( piano , allegro , andante , solo , soprano , etc. ) and commerce ( bank , bankrupt , balance , traffic , , ducat , florin ) ? one need not accumulate examples , as everybody interested in the subject of this book will be able to supply a great many from his own reading . The most comprehensive groups of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have flooded the whole world of Western civilization from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and have given a family-character to all those parts of the vocabularies of otherwise different languages which 14 // are concerned with the highest intellectual and technical activities . See the detailed discussion of these strata of loan-words in English in GS ch. v and vi . When one nation has imbibed for centuries the cultural influence of another , its language may have become so infiltrated with words from the other language that these are found in most sentences , at any rate in nearly every sentence dealing with things above the simplest material necessities . The best-known examples are English since the influx of French and classical words , and Turkish with its wholesale importations from Arabic . Another example is Basque , in which nearly all expressions for religious and spiritual ideas are Romanic . Basque is naturally very poor in words for general ideas ; it has names for special kinds of trees , but tree ' is arbolia , from Spanish arbol , animal ' is animate , colour ' colore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lili , thing ' gauza , time ' dembora . Thus also many of its names for utensils and garments , weights and measures , arms , etc. , are borrowed ; king ' is errege , law ' lege , lage , master ' maisu , etc . ( See Zs. f. roman . Phil. , 17. 140 ff . ) In a great many cases linguistic borrowing must be considered a necessity , but this is not always so . When a nation has once got into the habit of borrowing words , people will very often use foreign words where it would have been perfectly possible to express their ideas by means of native speech-material , the reason for going out of one 's own language being in some cases the desire to be thought fashionable or refined through interlarding one 's speech with foreign words , in others simply laziness , as is very often the case when people are rendering thoughts they have heard or read in a foreign tongue . Translators are responsible for the great majority of these intrusive words , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivation , or very often by turning the sentence a little differently from the foreign text . The most thoroughgoing speech mixtures are due much less to real race-mixture than to continued cultural contact , especially of a literary character , as is seen very clearly in English , where the Romanic element is only to a very small extent referable to the Norman conquerors , and far more to the peaceful relations of the following centuries . That Greek and Latin words have come in through the medium of literature hardly needs saying . Many of these words are superfluous : " The native words cold , cool , chilly , icy , frosty , might have seemed sufficient for all purposes , without any necessity for importing frigid , gelid and algid , which , as a matter of fact , are found neither in Shakespeare nor in the Authorized Version of the Bible nor in the poetical works of Milton , Pope , Cowper and Shelley " ( GS ? 136 ) . But on the ? 10 GENERAL THEORY OF LOAN-WORDS 211 other hand it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriched the language through enabling its users to obtain greater variety and to find expressions for many subtle shades of thought . The question of the value of loan-words can not be dismissed offhand , as the purists ' in many countries are inclined to imagine , with the dictum that foreign words should be shunned like the plague , but requires for its solution a careful consideration of the merits and demerits of each separate foreign term viewed in connexion with the native resources for expressing that particular idea . XI. ? ? 11 . Classes of Loan-words . It is quite natural that there should be a much greater inclination everywhere to borrow full ' words ( substantives , adjectives , notional verbs ) than empty ' words ( pronouns , prepositions , conjunctions , auxiliary verbs ) , to which class most of the grammatical ' words belong But there is no hard-and-fast limit between the two classes . It is rare for a language to take such words as numerals from another language ; yet examples are found here and there ? thus , in connexion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backgammon-players counted in England by means of the French words ace , deuce , tray , cater , cinque , size , and with the English game of lawn tennis the English way of counting ( fifteen love , etc. ) has been lately adopted in Russia and to some extent also in Denmark . In some parts of England Welsh numerals were until comparatively recent times used in the counting of sheep . Cattle-drivers in Jutland used to count from 20 to 90 in Low German learnt in Hamburg and Holstein , where they sold their cattle . In this case the clumsiness and want of perspicuity of the Danish expressions ( halvtredsindstyve for Low German fofdix , etc. ) may have been one of the reasons for preferring the German words ; in the same way the clumsiness of the Eskimo way of counting ( " third toe on the second foot of the fourth man , " etc. ) has favoured the introduction into Greenlandic of the Danish words for 100 and 1,000 : with an Eskimo ending , untriligdlit and tusintigdlit . Most Japanese numerals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most civilized countries . Prepositions , too , are rarely borrowed by one language from another . Yet the Latin ( Ital. ) per is used in English , German and Danish , and the French a in the two latter languages , and both arp extending their domain beyond the commercial language in which they were first used . The Greek kata , at first also commercial , has in Spanish found admission into the ordinary language and has become the pronoun cads each . ' // Personal and demonstrative pronouns , articles and the like are scarcely ever taken over from one language to another . They are so definitely woven into the innermost texture of a language that no one would think of giving them up , however much he might like to adorn his speech with words from a foreign source . If , therefore , in one instance we find a case of a language borrowing words of this kind , we are justified in thinking that exceptional causes must have been at work , and such really proves to be the case in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their . It is usual to speak of English as being a mixture of native Old English ( Anglo-Saxon ' ) and French , but as a matter of fact the French influence , powerful as it is in the vocabulary and patent as it is to the eyes of everybody , is superficial in comparison with the influence exercised in a much subtler way by the Scandinavian settlers in the North of England . The French influence is different in extent , but not in kind , from the French influence on German or the old Gothonic influence on Finnic ; it is perhaps best compared with the German influence on Danish in the Middle Ages . But the Scandinavian influence on English is of a different kind . The number of Danish and Norwegian settlers in England must have been very large , as is shown by the number of Scandinavian place-names ; yet that does not account for everything . A most important factor was the great similarity of the two languages , in spite of numerous points of difference . Accordingly , when their fighting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent be able to make themselves understood by one another , like people talking two dialects of the same language , or like students from Copenhagen and from Lund nowadays . Many of the most common words were absolutely identical , and others differed only slightly .. ' Hence it comes that in the Middle English texts we find a great many double forms of the same word , one English and the other Scandinavian , used side by side , some of these doublets even surviving till the present day , though now differentiated in sense ( e.g. whole , hale ; no , nay ; from , fro ; shirt , skirt ) , while in other cases one only of the two forms , either the native or the Scandinavian , has survived ; thus the Scandinavian sister and egg have ousted the English sweostor and ey . We find , therefore , a great many words adopted of a kind not usually borrowed ; thus , everyday verbs and adjectives like take , call , hit , die , ill , ugly , wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , wing , etc . ( For details see my GS ch. iv . ) All this indicates an intimate fusion of the two races and of the two languages , such as is not provided for in any of the classes described by Hempl ( above , ? 8 ) . In most speech-mixtures the various elements remain distinct and can // be separated , just as after shuffling a pack of cards you can pick out the hearts , spades , etc. ; but in the case of English and Scandinavian we have a subtler and more intimate fusion , very much as when you put a lump of sugar into a cup of tea and a few minutes afterwards are quite unable to say which is tea and which is sugar . XI. ? g 12 . Influence on Grammar . The question has often been raised whether speech-mixture affects the grammar of a language which has borrowed largely from some other language . The older view is expressed pointedly by Whitney ( L 199 ) : " Such a thing as a language with a mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students : it would be to them a monstrosity ; it seems an impossibility . " This is an exaggeration , and can not be justified , for the simple reason that the vocabulary of a language and its grammatical apparatus ' can not be nicely separated in the way presupposed : indeed , much of the borrowed material mentioned in our last paragraphs does belong to the grammatical apparatus . But there is , of course , some truth in Whitney 's dictum . When a word is borrowed it is not as a rule taken over with all the elaborate flexion which may belong to it in its original home ; as a rule , one form only is adopted , it may be the nominative or some other case of a noun , the infinitive or the present or the naked stein of a verb . This form is then either used unchanged or with the endings of the adopting language , generally those of the most regular ' declension or conjugation . It is an exceptional case when more than one flexional form is taken over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In learned usage we find in older Danish such case-flexion as gen . Christi , dat . Christo , by the side of nom . Christus , also , e.g. , i theatro , and still sometimes in German we have the same usage : e.g. mit den pronominibus . In a somewhat greater number of instances the plural form is adopted as well as the singular form , as in English fungi , formulw , phenomena , seraphim , etc. , but the natural tendency is always towards using the native endings , funguses , formulas , etc. , and this has prevailed in all popular words , e.g. ideas , circuses , museums . As the formation of cases , tenses , etc. , in different languages is often very irregular , and the distinctive marks are often so intimately connected with the kernel of the word and so unsubstantial as not to be easily distinguished , it is quite natural that no one should think of borrowing such endings , etc. , and applying them to native words . Schuchardt once thought that the English genitive ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies ) , where gobernadors casa stands for governor 's house , ' but he now explains the // form more correctly as originating in the possessive pronoun su : gobernador su casa ( dem g. sein haus , Sitzungsber. der preuss . Akademie , 1917 , 524 ) . It was at one time commonly held that the English plural ending s , which in Old English was restricted in its application , owes its extension to the influence of French . This theory , I believe , was finally disposed of by the six decisive arguments I brought forward against it in 1891 ( reprinted in ChE ? 39 ) . But after what has been said above on the Scandinavian influence , I incline to think that E. Classen is right in thinking that the Danes count for something in bringing about the final victory of -s over its competitor -n , for the Danes had no plural in -n , and -s reminded them of their own -r ( Mod . Language Rev. 14. 94 ; cf. also -s in the third person of verbs , Scand. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite natural that the Scandinavians should have exercised a general levelling influence on the English language , as many niceties of grammar would easily be sacrificed where mutual intelligibility was so largely brought about by the common vocabulary . Accordingly , we find that in the regions in which the Danish settlements were thickest the wearing away of grammatical forms was a couple of centuries in advance of the same process in the southern parts of the country . Derivative endings certainly belong to the grammatical apparatus ' of a language ; yet many such endings have been taken over into another language as parts of borrowed words and have then been freely combined with native speech-material . The phenomenon is extremely frequent in English , where we have , for instance , the Romanic endings - ess ( shepherdess , seeress ) , - ment ( endearment , bewilderment ) , - age ( mileage , cleavage , shortage ) , - ante ( hindrance , forbearance ) and many more . In Danish and German the number of similar instances is much more restricted , yet we have , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also older words like bageri , bdcicerei , etc . It is the same with prefixes : English has formed many words with de- , co- , inter- , pre- , anti- and other classical prefixes : de-anglicize , co-godfather , intermarriage , at pre-war prices , anti-slavery , etc. ( quotations in my GS ? 124 ; cf. MEG ii . 14. 66 ) . Ex- has established itself in many languages ex-king , ex-roi , ex-konge , ex-kongg , etc . In Danish the prefix he- , borrowed from German , is used very extensively with native words : bebrejde , bebo , bebygge , and this is not the only German prefix that is productive in the Scandinavian languages . With regard to syntax , very little can be said except in a , general way : languages certainly do influence each other syntactically , and those who know a foreign language only imperfeotly are apt to transfer to it methods of construction from their ii // own tongue . Many instances of this have been collected by Schuchardt , SID . But it is doubtful whether these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those exerted on one 's own language by the habit of translating foreign works into it : in this purely literary way a great many idioms and turns of phrases have been introduced into English , German and the Scandinavian languages from French and Latin , and into Danish and Swedish from German . The accusative and infinitive construction , which had only a very restricted use in Old English , has very considerably extended its domain through Latin influence , and the so-called ' absolute construction ' ( in my own grammatical terminology called ' nexus subjunct ' ) seems to be entirely due to imitation of Latin syntax . In the Balkan tongues there are some interesting instances of syntactical agreement between various languages , which must be due to oral influence through the necessity imposed on border peoples of passing continually from one language to another : the infinitive has disappeared from Greek , Rumanian and Albanian , and the definite article is placed after the substantive in Rumanian , Albanian and Bulgarian . XI. ? ? 13 . Translation-loans . Besides direct borrowings we have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less closely on foreign ones , though consisting of native speech-material . I take some examples from the very full and able paper " Notes sur les Calques Linguistiques " contributed by Kr . Sandfeld to the Festschrift Vilh . Thomsen , 1912 : wdificatio : G. erbauung , Dan . opbyggelse ; cequilibrium : G. gleicbgewicht , Dan . ligevoogt ; beneficium : G. wohltat , Dan . velgerning ; conscientia : Goth. mipwissi , G. gewissen , Dan . samvittighed , Swed. samvete , Russ . soznanie ; omnipotens : E. almighty , G. allma , clhtig , Dan . almTgtig ; arrierepensde : hintergedanke , bagtanke ; bien-etre : wohlsein , velvaere ; exposition : austellung , udstilling ; etc . Sandfeld gives many more examples , and as he has in most instances been able to give also corresponding words from various Slavonic languages as well as from Magyar , Finnic , etc. , he rightly concludes that his collections serve to throw light on that community in thought and expression which Bally has well termed " la mentalite europeenne . " ( But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having a much greater propensity to swallowing foreign words raw , as it were , than to translating them . ) XII. ? ? 1 . Beach-la-Mar . As a first typical example of a whole class of languages now found in many parts of the world where people of European civilization have come into contact with men of other races , we may take the so-called . Beach-la-mar ( or Beche-le-mar , or Beehe de mer English ) ; ' it is also sometimes called Sandalwood English . It is spoken and understood all over the Western Pacific , its spread being largely due to the fact that the practice of blackbirding ' often brought together on the same plantation many natives from different islands with mutually incompre-hensible languages , whose only means of communication was the broken English they had picked up from the whites . And now the natives learn this language from each other , while in many places the few Europeans have to learn it from the islanders . " Thus the native use of Pidgin-English lays down the rules by which the Europeans let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find it quite easy at the beginning to understand Pidgin-English , and have to learn it before they are able to speak it properly " ( Landtman ) . 216 // I shall now try to give some idea of the structure of this lingo . The vocabulary is nearly all English . Even most of the words which ultimately go back to other languages have been admitted only because the English with wham the islanders were thrown into contact had previously adopted them into their own speech , so that the islanders were justified in believing that they were really English . This is true of the Spanish or Portuguese savvy , ' to know , ' and pickaninny , ' child ' or ' little one ' ( a favourite in many languages on account of its symbolic sound ; see Ch . XX ? 8 ) , as well as the Amerindian tomahawk , which in the whole of Australia is the usual word for a small axe . And if we find in Beach-la-mar the two Maori words tape or taboo and kai , or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' they have probably got into the language through English ? we know that both are very extensively used in Australia , while the former is known all over the civilized world . Likkilik or liklik , small , almost , ' is said to be from a Polynesian word liki , but may be really a perversion of Engl. little . Landtman gives a few words from unknown languages used by the Kiwais , though not derived from their own language . The rest of the words found in my sources are English , though not always pure English , in so far as their signification is often curiously distorted . Nusipepa means ' a letter , any written or printed document , ' mary is the general term for woman ' ( cf. above , p. 118 ) , pisupo ( peasoup ) for all foreign foods which are preserved in tins ; squareface , the sailor 's name for a square gin-bottle , is extended to all forms of glassware , no matter what the shape . One of the earliest seafarers is said to have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have mentioned these two words together ; the natives took them as one word , and now bullamacow or pulu-makau means ' cattle , beef , also tinned beef ' ; pulomokau is now given as a native word in a dictionary of the Fijian language . ' Bulopenn , which means ' ornament , ' is said to be nothing but the English blue paint . All this shows the purely accidental character of many of the linguistic acquisitions of the Polynesians . As the vocabulary is extremely limited , composite expres-sions are sometimes resorted to in order to express ideas for which we have simple words , and not unfrequently the devices used appear to us very clumsy or even comical . A piano is called ' big fellow bokus ( box ) you fight him he cry , ' and a // concertina ' little fellow bokus you shove hire he cry , you pull him he cry . ' Woman he got faminil ( ' family ' ) inside means ' she is with child . ' Inside is also used extensively about mental states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ' to consider , ' inside bad ' grieved or sorry , ' feel inside ' to know , ' feel another kind inside ' to change one 's mind . ' My throat he fast ' I was dumb . ' , ) He took daylight a long time ' lay awake . ' Bring fellow belong make open bottle ' bring me a corkscrew . ' Water belong stink ' perfumery . ' The idea of being bald is thus expressed : grass belong head belong him all he die finish , or with another variant , coconut belong him grass no stop , for coconut is taken from English slang in the sense ' head ' ( Schuchardt has the sentence : You no savvy that fellow white man coconut belong him no grass ? ) . For feather ' the combination grass belong pigeon is used , pigeon being a general term for any bird . A man who wanted to borrow a saw , the word for which he had forgotten , said : ' You give me brother belong tomahawk , he come he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he saw a train , on his return called it ' steamer he walk about along bush . ' Natives who watched Landtman when he enclosed letters in envelopes named the latter house belong letter . ' Alany of these expressions are thus picturesque descriptions made on the spur of the moment if the proper word is not known . XII. ? ? 2 . Grammar . These phrases have already illustrated some points of the very simple grammar of this lingo . Words have only one form , and what is in our language expressed by flexional forms is either left unexpressed or else indicated by auxiliary words . The plural of nouns is like the singular ( though the form men is found in my texts alongside of man ) ; when necessary , the plural is indicated by means of a prefixed all : all he talk ' they say ' ( also him fellow all they ' ) ; all man everybody ' ; a more indefinite plural is plenty man or full up man . For we ' is said me two fella or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me two fellow Lagia means ' I and Lagia . ' If there are more , me altogether man or me plenty man may be said , though we is also in use . Fellow ( fella ) is a much-vexed word ; it is required , or at any rate often used , after most pronouns , thus , that fellow hat , this fellow knife , me fellow , you fellow , him fellow ( not he fellow ) ; it is foun very often after an adjective and seems to be required to prop up the adjective before the substantive : big fellow name , big fellow tobacco , another fellow man . In other cases no fellow is used , and it seems difficult to give definite rules ; after // a numeral it is frequent : two fellow men ( man ? ) , three fellow bottle . There is a curious employment in ten fellow ten one fellow , which means 101 . It is used adverbially in that man he cry big fellow ' he cries loudly . ' The genitive is expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which also serves for other prepositional relations . Examples : tail belong him , pappa belong me , wife belong you , belly belong me walk about too much ( I was seasick ) , me savvee talk along white man ; rope along bush means liana . Missis / man belong bullamacow him stop ( the butcher has come ) . What for you wipe hauls belong-a you on clothes belong esseppoon ? ( spoon , i.e. napkin ) . Cf. above the expressions for ' bald . ' Piccaninny belong banana ' a young b. plant . ' Belong also naturally means ' to live in , be a native of ' ; boy belong island , he belong Burriburrigan . The preposition along is used about many local relations ( in , at , on , into , on board ) . From such combinations as laugh along ( 1 . at ) and he speak along this fella the transition is easy to cases in which along serves to indicate the indirect object : he give 'm this fella Eve along Adam , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , you gammon along me ( deceive , lie to me ) , and with the form belong ; he puss-puss belong this fellow ( puss-puss orig. a cat , then as a verb to caress , make love to ) . There is no distinction of gender : that woman he brother belong me = she is my sister ' ; he ( before the verb ) and him ( in all other positions ) serve both for he , she and it . There is a curious use of ' m , um or em , in our texts often written him , after a verb as a ' vocal sign of warning that an object of the verb is to follow , ' no matter what that object is . Churchill says that " in the adjective comparison is unknown ; the islanders do not know how to think comparatively ? at least , they lack the form of words by which comparison may be indicated ; this big , that small is the nearest they can come to the expression of the idea that one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and also more better : ' no good make him that fashion , more better make him all same . ' The same double comparative I find in another place , used as a kind of verb meaning ' ought to , had better ' : more better you come out .
