Chicago 's police chief , Michael ( " Go Get ' Em Mike " ) Hughes , last week went to a hospital and had his tonsils removed . Then , recumbent , he resigned his post . Stated reason : health . The Hughes tonsils , however , had little to do with the Hughes resignation . The Hughes resignation had long been sought by citizens , including the loud Tribune , who had grown weary of Chicago 's bawdy disorderliness under Mayor William Hale ( " Big Bill the Builder " ) Thompson . The Hughes resignation seemed to indicate that an end to the whole Thompson phenomenon was in sight . Thompson and his men were beaten and discredited in the primary election this spring . Thompson has been convicted of grafting and . ordered to pay back $2,500,000 to the city . Thompson 's city-comptroller has had to resign , owing to huge deficits in the city 's finances . Thompson 's rich friend , George F. Getz , has transferred his funds and interest to the political projects of a man who used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Smith . Thompson has lately been complaining , like Hughes , of ill health . Last week , like Hughes a few days prior , Thompson denied that he himself was going to resign . Chicagoans last week talked of putting Vice President Charles Gates Dawes at the head of a consolidated anti-crime commission to rehabilitate Chicago 's self-respect .
