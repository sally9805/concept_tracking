These bearers are nearly all half- or quarter-breeds mongrel mixtures of all shades and colors . Gomez , the second-man , is a cross between Indian and Portuguese and is the most treacherous of the lot . ) The trader , a couple of Indian rubber-men , three more half-breed children , five , six and seven years old respectively , stand about watching the party getting into the last of the canoes . Leaning up against the string-piece , still idly strumming her guitar , is the young half-breed girl . She is singing softly - her provocative eyes following Ed. 313 . LONGER SHOT OF THE RIVER - Roxton , Paula and Summerlee in one of the canoes - their paddlers already in place . As they start after Paula and Roxton , waving their hands to the trader , etc .

BACK TO A LONGER ATMOSPHERIC SHOT - of the canoes as they disappear around a bend in the river . ( The orchestra throughout this episode playing the plaintive melody of the half-breed girl 's song . ) VERY SLOW FADE OUT ( This wistful " farewell " music continues as we - ) VERY SLOWLY FADE IN 316 . A GORGEOUS TROPICAL SUNSET - then when the sun is nearly gone - SLOWLY LAP DISSOLVE INTO 317 . SECOND RIVER LOCATION - river narrower . On a great tree trunk which has fallen partly into the water , stands an Indian naked and alert . As he vanishes softly into dense shadow of woods , the canoes glide into the picture and we - CUT TO 318 . C. V. OF ONE OF CANOES - which now contains Challenger , Ed , Gomez and two other paddlers . Challenger is well toward the front of the dugout . Ed is peacefully at work hammering out a report to McArdle on his portable typewriter - his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Immediately behind him is Gomez , the quarter-breed - a villainous looking fellow , almost white , who is cursed with enough education to make him a malcontent and to give him an unfortunate influence over the other paddlers and bearers . He is trying to read what Ed is typing - the peaceful waters demanding little attention to his paddle . 319 . C. U. OF ED AND GOMEZ AS ABOVE - Ed has come to the end of a page . As he takes it out and reads it over we insert : INSERT - Typewritten page of Ed 's letter : " This is our thirteenth day in the canoes and we are now in the quiet waters of a little un-named stream . Our cargadores - paddlers - look like pirates but seem loyal . " BACK - As Ed sticks this loose sheet under his portfolio with others to keep them safely , he becomes aware that Gomez is too much interested in his literary efforts . As he inserts a second sheet and as he hammers out the following words , we insert : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The only weak spot is the quarter-breed , Gomez , a yellow-hearted cur who shirks his work , steals our food , and is now trying to read this over my shoulder . " BACK - As Ed types the last words , he waits a second to give Gomez a chance to catch up , then turns suddenly and confronts the disconcerted breed . Gomez 's eyes flash angrily - he is a sullen brute - and then he turns his attention exclusively to his paddling . With a dry smile , Ed goes on with his report .  --  42  --  320 . C. U. OF CHALLENGER - in the front of the dug-out . He is watching with the greatest intentness the seemingly unbroken vegetation along the near bank of the river . He suddenly puts up his hand to attract attention , then motions toward a reedy spot , a short distance ahead of them . He turns to Ed and says : &nbsp; CHALLENGER " Those green rushes mark my private doorway into the - unknown . " 321 . M. S. OF THE GREAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverging stream . 322 . C. U. OF ED - he is much impressed with this news - a growing inner excitement betrays itself in his eyes - he hastily starts to put away his writing paraphernalia - feeling that a fresh interest has come into the expedition . 323 . M. S. OF THE CANOES - as Challenger , also triumphant and excited , turns and calls loudly to Summerlee and Roxton in the other canoes : " We turn here ! " As his canoe turns in toward the reeds indicated , the others following , we - CUT TO 324 . M. S. OF GIANT REEDS ( GLASS ) - at first the reeds seem impenetrable but , as Challenger 's canoe appears , we pan the camera and reveal a small stream of more or less open water . Again Challenger gives the order , and his canoe slides into the narrow channel , the reeds brushing it . As the others follow - SLOWLY LAP DISSOLVE INTO 325 . M. S. EXT . SMALL STREAM - the branches nearly meeting overhead . A great crane wading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . A brush deer , standing in the water , vanishes swiftly in the dense undergrowth . A great macaw or perhaps a toucan sits on a dead branch - entirely undisturbed by the approach of man . Challenger 's canoe glides into camera , everyone alert - on guard . 326 . C. U. OF JOCKO - in Challenger 's canoe , as he looks up at branches and starts to chatter , greatly excited . 327 . C. V. OF A GREAT SNAKE - twined above a tree limb almost above the canoe . 328 . C. V. OF CANOE - as men see snake and the paddlers expertly shoot the canoe out from under the branch . 329 . C. V. OF ONE OF THE DOGS - snarling , showing his teeth - his spine bristling - his keen eyes on the underbrush near the bank . 330 . C. U. OF A GREAT JAGUAR - half-hidden among the low brush on bank , its baleful eyes on the canoes . It silently disappears into the underbrush . 331 . L.

NIGHT SCENE - Small natural clearing in the tropical forest - in a shaft of moonlight squats a naked Indian , beating on a great hollow log war drum . In this long shot he looks like a pygmy at the foot of the great trees . 333 . C. V. OF THE INDIAN - beating his drum - his face savage , degenerate - his whole manner hostile . He raises his face to the great full moon sailing high overhead . 334 . FLASH OF THE TROPICAL MOON - at full - riding through a thin rack of feathery clouds . 335 . NIGHT SCENE - ON CREST OF GREAT MOUND OF BARE ROCKS - a second Indian , also stark naked - beating on a war drum - spreading the alarm . 336 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now too narrow and shallow for the canoes , which are pulled up on the bank and unloaded . Hammocks are strung under the trees . In the foreground , grouped around a very small fire , we see Summerlee , sitting on a specimen case near the fire , arranging beetles , etc. in a smaller case . He is smoking his pipe . Nearby are Roxton , Ed , Paula , listening to the distant booming of the war drums . Standing erect , his head thrown back as if in defiance , is Challenger - also listening to the drums . Near him stands old Austin , placidly cutting himself a large hunk of chewing tobacco . ( Note : In all jungle scenes no one must be allowed to sit on the ground - all squat , sit in hammocks , etc . This is one of the first rules of jungle travel in the Amazon country . Fire-ants , ticks , etc. , etc. are the causes . ) In the background - grouped about a second cooking fire - we see the bearers , Zambo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot - but are all listening to the drums .

OF CHALLENGER - listening to the drums - his expression rather amused and condescending . 339 . S. C. U. OF ZAMBO - listening . He is caught in an arrested movement , his quid in one hand , the knife with which he has been cutting it in the other . 340 . S. L. S.

Ed joins her , stroking Jocko 's little head . His hand finally touches and rests on Paula 's . There is a tense pause , then - INSERT - Of the two hands as Paula slowly withdraws hers . BACK - Ed sighs - then they both listen to the drums again . 345 . S. C. U. OF SUMMERLEE - sitting on a specimen case , smoking his pipe , arranging some specimens in a smaller case , pauses to listen to the war drums , then leans across the fire and says to Ed : &nbsp; SUMMERLEE " Those cursed war drums again ! They have followed us for a week , now ! " CUT DIRECT TO 346 . M. C. U. OF SUMMERLEE , ED , PAULA AND JOCKO - as Summerlee finishes title , Paula shrinks a little toward Ed . Ed surreptitiously signals Summerlee to be silent . 347 . S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he hears Summerlee 's remark he looks down at him with lively contempt and barks back : &nbsp; CHALLENGER " They are merely signal drums of the Cucuma Indians . Degraded savages - with scarcely more intelligence than the average college professor ! " CUT DIRECT TO 348 . S. C. U. OF SUMMERLEE - sitting on a specimen case by the fire . As he hears Challenger 's insulting remark he rises , choking with anger and sputters at Challenger : &nbsp; SUMMERLEE " The average college professor at least has more brains than the average charlatan - " CUT DIRECT TO 349 . M. L. S. OF CHALLENGER AND SUMMERLEE - as Summerlee finishes title . Challenger breaks into his low , insulting chuckle . As Summerlee is about to add more , Roxton joins them and smilingly intervenes between the two in time to prevent a genuine row . 350 . M. S. IN FAIRLY OPEN SPACE AT EDGE OF BEAUTIFUL , FERN-RIMMED LITTLE POOL IN JUNGLE - NIGHT SCENE - about 20 yards distant from the camp . In the full moonlight we see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their evening drink . They suddenly scramble away , as one of the bearers from the camp approaches the pool with two big canteens - the biggest of the camp dogs at his heels . As the man stoops to fill the canteens , we - CUT TO 351 . C. U. OF THE DOG - drinking at pool . Suddenly it looks - bristles from head to tail - snarls and starts to bark violently - its eyes fixed on the thicket on the other side of the little pool . 352 . C. V. OF THE THICKET ACROSS THE POOL - silent - impenetrable - baffling , not a leaf stirring - no sign of life . 353 . C. U. OF THE BEARER - frozen in his tracks - the dripping canteen in his hand . His eyes slowly move , examining every twig and leaf of the thicket across the pool - otherwise he is absolutely motionless ready to spring aside - attack , or run , as the occasion demands . Dog barking and snarling , as before . Bearer very cautiously lowers the canteen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slowly raises his gun - every nerve on the alert against this unseen menace . As he stands thus at bay - waiting - CUT TO 354 . C. V. OF THE THICKET - still no sign of life . 355 . C. V. IN JUNGLE ON OTHER SIDE OF THICKET - screened by the bushes - we see a naked savage , standing in a shaft of the tropical white moonlight . In his hand he carries a great bow with one of the long poisoned arrows used by the Nhambiquara cannibals - poised , ready to shoot . The arrow is released - and goes sailing through the underbrush toward the half-breed bearer on the other side of the spring . 356 . C. U. OF THE HALF-BREED AT THE SPRING - as the arrow strikes him . With a yell of terror , he drops his gun and starts to dash back to camp , the arrow sticking in his shoulder - which he well knows means certain death . 357 . M. S. OF HALF-BREED 'S EXIT - as he dashes back to camp , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rage , the dog starts around the spring into the jungle after the savage . 358 . BACK TO M. S. OF THE CAMP - the two scientists still arguing about the war drums , Paula standing near them - smiling , Roxton - hearing the bearer coming crashing through the brush - touches Ed on the sleeve and they quietly move toward the edge of the camp to investigate - their guns in their hands . The wounded bearer runs into the scene , staggers by them and squats near the cook fire . Roxton and Ed hastily join him . Others cluster about . Zambo whips out a knife and starts to cut out the arrow . ( Note : These barbed shafts can not be withdrawn from a wound. ) 359 . M. S. MOONLIGHT - OF A TRAIL IN THE JUNGLE - flash of the naked savage with his bow and arrow as he swiftly speeds away - the dog at his heels . The dog chases him some distance , then gives it up and starts back to camp , deciding he has chased this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BACK TO CAMP - C. V. NEAR BEARER 'S FIRE - of the wounded man , Ed , Challenger , Roxton and Zambo . Zambo is cutting the arrow out of the man 's shoulder . Roxton examines it curiously as Zambo and Austin minister to the dying man , who is already in a half-stupor. 361 . C. V. OF GOMEZ AND OTHER BEARERS - a little apart from group about wounded man - looking toward him - then at each other . As Gomez , evidently a leader among them , starts to talk in a low tone - CUT TO 362 . C. U. OF ROXTON AND CHALLENGER - leaning over the cook fire , examining the arrow . Zambo joins them - also curious about arrow . Roxton looks at Challenger and says quietly : &nbsp; ROXTON " One of the poison arrows used by the Nhambiquara cannibals - the poor chap will be dead in a few minutes ! " BACK - As he finishes title - CUT TO 363 . C. U. OF ZAMBO - the big negro - as he rolls his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : &nbsp; ZAMBO " Say , Boss , dis you all say - cannibules ? " 364 . C. U. OF ROXTON - as he looks over at Zambo , smiles dryly and replies : &nbsp; ROXTON " I said cannibals , Zambo - but , I 'm told , they always prefer - white meat . " 365 . C. U. OF ZAMBO - as he digests Roxton 's remark . Then a relieved smile slowly spreads over his face as he replies : &nbsp; ZAMBO " I sho ' am glad to hear you speak dem words , Boss ! " BACK - Zambo finishes title . 366 . M. S. OF THE GROUP - as they turn their attention once more to the wounded man . 367 . SHOT IN HIGH LONELY PLACE - MOONLIGHT - a natural clearing in the jungle , surrounded by beautiful tree ferns , etc . The savage is still squatting or standing by his drum - but now the drum is silent . Twenty other naked savages are squatting in a circle , chanting solemnly to the moon . The man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diversion . The men spring to their feet . There is a hurried conference , then the chief suddenly turns and gives a sharp cry to the man at the drums . 368 . C. U. OF MAN AT DRUM - as he starts a terrific tattoo on his resounding instrument . ( Note : All these naked savage shots are in silhouette in the moonlight , or so grouped as to get by the censors. )  --  47  --  369 . BACK TO CAMP - M. S. OF THE ENTIRE GROUP - as they listen to this fresh outburst . All but the two scientists are very grave - knowing this means fresh mischief . Gomez and his men restless - disturbed - secretive . 370 . C. V. OF SUMMERLEE AND CHALLENGER - listening to the drum . Challenger says grimly : &nbsp; CHALLENGER " More drum talk ! These sneaking devils are telegraphing the " good news " that they have killed one of our men ! " BACK - Summerlee looking at him , laughs derisively , and demands : &nbsp; SUMMERLEE " You now admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " BACK - He indicates the arrow in his hand . Challenger snorts impatiently and turns away - hating to admit that Summerlee could be right in anything . Both perfectly oblivious to the dangers hanging over them - lost in their scientific squabbles . 371 . C. V. OF ED AND PAULA AS BEFORE - both listening to drums - then their eyes meet . After a tense pause she forces a smile , puts her hand on his sleeve and , with an effort at lightness , asks gamely : &nbsp; PAULA " If we are ever in real danger of capture , will you promise to shoot me , Ed ? " BACK - Again their eyes meet - then Ed , too moved to speak , suddenly kisses her hand as it rests on his sleeve - turns and moves away - not trusting himself to say more . Paula stands looking down at the hand Ed kissed . 372 . C. U. OF ROXTON - watching this little scene from a short distance , his eyes betraying his jealousy . As Ed leaves Paula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ED - apart from others - trying to hide the storm of feeling which the little scene with Paula has aroused . Roxton joins him and says quietly : &nbsp; ROXTON " We 'd better scout about a bit , young fellah-my-lad ! " BACK - Ed agrees and , guns in hand , they start quietly into the narrow trail leading to the spring . 374 . M. S. AS ED AND ROXTON - exit toward spring . 375 . C. V. OF PAULA - she watches Ed and Roxton going into the jungle trail - her eyes very anxious . Knowing that their lives are in imminent danger and that any protest from her would not be heeded . Challenger joins her . She quietly explains and asks him to go after Ed and Roxton , to add strength to their little party . Challenger agrees and disappears along the narrow trail toward the spring - gun in hand . 376 . M. S. - as Challenger disappears into the trail leading to the spring . 377 . C. U.

OF GOMEZ AND GROUP - watching them go - then look toward Zambo , the head-man , who is giving the dying bearer a drink and otherwise tending him . 381 . C. V. OF ZAMBO , ETC. - near dying man 's hammock. 382 . C. U. OF GOMEZ 'S EVIL FACE - his eyes on the group at the cook fire . It is evident that mutiny is in the air - and that Gomez has all the bearers , except Zambo , the head-man , on his side . As Gomez turns back to his followers - CUT TO 383 . C. V. OF GOMEZ AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low tones - their eyes often travelling toward Austin , Summerlee and Paula , etc . FADE OUT FADE IN 384 . M. S. IN ANOTHER PART OF THE JUNGLE - we see Ed , Roxton and Challenger , all with their guns , crouching in a bit of thick fern jungle , the bright moonlight illuminating their tense faces . Absolutely motionless and silent . 385 . S. C. U. OF THE THREE MEN AS ABOVE - to establish their caution and tenseness as they watch and listen - all three looking toward : 386 . L. S. IN NATURAL CLEARING IN JUNGLE - ( Same as scene 367. ) - surrounded by the beautiful tree ferns and lower bush - we see the company of about twenty Nhambiquara savages , dancing in the white moonlight , to the sound of their big drums . All have their great bows and plentiful supply of the poisoned arrows . As they circle , they raise their great bows ( their arrows poised , as if ready to shoot toward the moon ) then lower them as if against some foe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them only in silhouette and at a distance as they are stark naked . 387 . C. U. OF ROXTON , ED AND CHALLENGER - watching the dance . They hear a faint rustle in the brush nearby - cautiously look toward : 388 . C. U. OF A GREAT SPOTTED JAGUAR - standing in a little clear space , surrounded by the ferns , etc. - the moonlight full on him . 389 . C. U. OF THE MEN - Ed cautiously , silently , raises his gun , but , before he can fire , Roxton touches his arm , then indicates the dancing savages - better  --  49  --  risk the jaguar , which has not yet seen them , than to attract the attention of cannibals . Ed lowers his gun . All listen to jaguar 's stealthy tread - tense - alert - 390 . C. U. FLASH OF THE GREAT JAGUAR - as it majestically moves away . ( If there is any breeze stirring , the beast must be to the windward of the men , as it does not get their scent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the jaguar move away - they relax in some relief . All look once more at the dancing cannibals. 392 . M. S. OF THE BOW-AND-ARROW DANCE IN FULL SWING - in black silhouette - barbarous , remote , menacing , but very picturesque , with the great bows raised high , the arrows pointed toward the moon - perhaps their god . 393 . C. U. OF THE MEN - silently peering through the brush at the cannibals dancing . Then Roxton whispers to Ed : &nbsp; ROXTON " We 'd better go back to the canoes - these chaps 'll keep this up until daylight . " BACK - He indicates the dancing savages . Ed nods and whispers back : &nbsp; ED " - and we 'll be miles up the river by that time ! " BACK - They turn to Challenger , who has never taken his eyes off the dancing savages , his scientific mind fascinated by this exhibition of savage folk-dancing . Roxton and Ed exchange amused glances , then Ed touches the absorbed man gently on his shoulder , indicating silently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a sound , rustle a leaf or break a twig and start out of the scene , toward the camp , guns in hand , and are soon lost in the encircling shadows . FADE OUT FADE IN 394 . M. L. S. OF STREAM - evidently some miles below the camp - path of moonlight playing across the water , making the whole scene one of spectral beauty . When the scene is well in - two of the dug-outs glide into the picture - all the canoes in the expedition . For the first time in the picture we see them slipping rapidly away down the stream , going with the current instead of against it - evidently headed back toward civilization and the beaten tracks . They are paddling furiously - looking back over their shoulders - evidently fearing pursuit . 395 . C. U. OF FIRST CANOE - and pan in order to identify each occupant . In doing this we discover that only the paddlers and bearers are aboard . None of the whites , none of the scientific paraphernalia , but plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of panning is repeated with each of the other four canoes - to definitely establish that all the whites and Zambo are missing . The faces of the men show a mixture of triumph , excitement - and fear of being followed . They have all the dogs with them . Gomez is established in the first pan . He is urging the paddlers to greater efforts - looking back for indications of pursuit , etc. 396 . BACK TO L. S. OF CANOES - as they glide on rapidly down the stream and disappear around one of  --  50  --  the heavily wooded bends . 397 . BACK TO M. S. OF THE SPRING LOCATION - still bathed in moonlight . Challenger , Ed and Roxton are seen hurrying toward the camp , stringing out in single file , Challenger in the lead , as they disappear down the narrow , vine-choked trail . They have no suspicion of anything wrong . 398 . C. V. AT THE CAMP - shooting directly toward the narrow entrance that leads to the spring - no other part of the camp being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - an expression of startled amazement , swiftly followed by one of rage and horror , flashes over his face as he sees : 399 . M. S. OF THE CAMP - all the bearers ' hammocks , except the one in which the body of the Indian who was shot by the arrow is still lying , are empty . All the cooking pots , etc. , also have disappeared . The cook fire has nearly died out - only a thin spiral of smoke marking its place . Lying sprawled on the ground bound hand and foot by lianas ( the great rope-like vines that hang from all the trees ) , lies the giant Zambo , rolling about , writhing in pain but making frantic efforts to free himself . His right arm , although bound to his side , is nearly severed above the elbow - a clean cut made by one of the machete knives . He is too intent upon his efforts to rid himself of his fetters to hear the approach of the men . Old Austin and Summerlee are gagged and lashed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in sight . Challenger , followed by Roxton and Ed , rushes into the scene and , with their machete knives , they immediately release the prisoners . 400 . C. U. OF ED - as his horrified eyes take in the scene , then he turns to the others and cries : &nbsp; ED " Paula ! " 401 . S. C. U. OF GROUP - as Roxton and Challenger turn and stare at Ed in appalled silence . Summerlee points off into the fern-tangle . He is holding his mouth , speaking with difficulty , his jaw and tongue half-paralyzed from the gag which he has just been able to remove . His cartridge belt , revolvers , knife and gun have been stolen by the deserters . Challenger , Ed and Roxton plunge into the fern-tangle . As they go , Austin is seen bending over Zambo , trying to stanch his wound . 402 . C. V. IN FERN-TANGLE - of Ed , Challenger and Roxton - Ed now in the lead - as he discovers Paula , also bound and gagged , lying face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAULA - bound and gagged - unable to move hand or foot , lying face down in the ferns . Clinging to her is little Jocko - frightened , but faithful . 404 . C. V. OF THE GROUP - as Ed - with a smothered cry - gathers Paula into his arms . She is conscious . With cries of thankfulness and relief they carry her back into the camp . Jocko with Challenger , who is petting the little fellow . 405 . M. S. OF CAMP - as the men emerge from the fern-tangle . Ed puts Paula in her hammock . He and Roxton hastily cut the lianas that bind her and remove the gag . Challenger insists upon her taking a little brandy . Jocko - much in evidence - perches on the hammock.  --  51  --  406 . C. U. OF PAULA - in her hammock as above . She swallows the brandy , leaning against Challenger , who is almost like a father to her , then gasps , indicating the wounded negro - &nbsp; PAULA " Poor Zambo tried to prevent them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 407 . M. S. OF THE GROUP - Challenger motions to Ed and Roxton to attend to this while he stays and administers to Paula . As Roxton turns to Zambo , Ed goes to the river 's edge , to reconnoitre . 408 . C. U. AT RIVER 'S EDGE OF ED - looking up and down the stream . No sign of the canoes . He glances down at the trampled mud . 409 . C. V. OF TRAMPLED MUD - marks show plainly that canoes were launched down stream . 410 . C. U. OF ED - as he looks up from examining marks made by launching canoes - shades his eyes , looking down stream . Gives it up - starts slowly back toward others . 411 . M. S. OF AUSTIN - who has already freed Zambo from his fetters , is applying first aid to his wound , Summerlee standing by with the emergency kit . Zambo is sitting on a fallen log , looking like a very sick man - limp , dispirited , Roxton making a hurried but expert examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF ROXTON AND ZAMBO - as Roxton makes his hurried but expert examination of Zambo 's bandage . As he touches it , Zambo lets out a howl of pain . Roxton , paying no attention to this , arranges a sling for Zambo 's arm , saying grimly : &nbsp; ROXTON " You 're a lucky dog , Zambo - if you could n't walk we 'd have to leave you here ! " BACK - Roxton finishing title . 413 . C. U. OF ZAMBO - he rolls his eyes - slowly but surely pulls himself together - and whispers hoarsely : &nbsp; ZAMBO " Oh , I can walk all right , Boss ! I don ' want to be lef ' heah fo ' a reception committee fo ' no cannibules ! " BACK - Zambo finishing title . 414 . M. S. OF GROUP - Roxton and the others grim - their tribute to the game and loyal black , who can make his little joke even when suffering unspeakable pain . 415 . S. C. U. OF ROXTON AND ZAMBO - as Roxton finishes arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zambo 's machete from the ground , puts it in his left hand and says :  --  52  --  &nbsp; ROXTON " You ca n't shoot with your left hand , Zambo , but you can out trail - and we 've got to be a dam ' long way off by daybreak ! " BACK - Zambo takes the knife in his left hand and says : " Yessir ! " He adds : " I dropped my gun somewhere - " 416 . C. U. OF THE GROUP - as Zambo discovers his gun . Roxton says : " Good ! " Takes it and hands it to Austin , who can use it . Roxton and Austin exit out of scene , followed by Zambo staring wild-eyed about him - thoroughly impressed with the cannibal idea . 417 . M. S. AS AUSTIN AND ROXTON JOIN THE OTHERS - we find that Challenger , Ed and Paula are already rolling up hammocks , making up the packs , etc. - making ready for the trail as rapidly as they can , taking much of the provisions that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can manage . 418 . M. S. OF THE MOON DANCE - still going strong . 419 . FLASH OF CANOES - now in another part of the river - paddling rapidly down with the current . 420 . M. S. ON THE TRIAL - close to the river - headed up stream . Full moonlight . Our whole party , each carrying what he can , is hiking rapidly , silently and cautiously up the bank of the river , cutting the lianas and low brush as they go . Owing to the narrowness of the trail , they travel single file . Challenger is in the lead , followed by Austin , then Zambo , then Ed , then Paula with Jocko - with Roxton as rear guard . As they disappear - the brush almost closing behind them - ( Note : Ed , Challenger and Roxton are fully armed , as they had their guns , revolvers and machetes with them . Austin has Zambo 's gun , as Zambo can not use it . Zambo has only his knife and one revolver . Paula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) FADE OUT SLOW FADE IN pp. 28-40 &nbsp; pp. 53-73 421 . L. S. OF THE CAMP - in the faint , pink light of the dawn . Standing at the river 's edge , where the trampled mud , etc. , plainly show where the canoes were launched , stand several of the cannibals . Looking off down the river , their backs to the camera - from their pantomime we can see that they think they have arrived too late , and believe that the whole party has given up and gone back down the river . In the background we see the dead bearer still lying in the hammock . As the cannibals turn from the river 's edge and move back to join the others , gathered around the hammock discussing the dead body - FADE OUT SLOW FADE IN 422 . M. L. S. GLASS SHOT OF THE GREAT PLAIN - dotted here and there with clump of palms . The sickle of the new moon is hanging low above a great plateau which rises abruptly some five hundred feet above the plain , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sluggish stream meanders across the plain and ends up in a spring-fed marsh at the foot of this plateau .  --  53  --  Several cranes are rooting around in this marsh . Near the stream , directly under the precipitous walls of the plateau , we see our little group , busily pitching camp . A light fly-tent is already up . ( This is for Paula 's use . ) Hammocks are slung between the palms for the others . Old Austin is in one of the hammocks - down with the fever . Zambo 's right arm is still in a sling , but he is near Austin , ministering to him , as well as he can . Challenger and Summerlee are standing near the camp fire , discussing the plateau which looms above them . Roxton and Paula are standing at the edge of the swamp , near the tent , discussing the plateau , looking at the perpendicular sides through glasses . Sitting on a box close to them with his inevitable typewriter on a second box before him , is Ed thumping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. OF THE CAMP - as described above . DISSOLVE INTO 424 . C. U.

OF CHALLENGER AND SUMMERLEE - standing a little apart from the others , gazing at the plateau - both affected by its almost spectral beauty and mystery as it looms above them , bathed in the tropical moonlight . They are held spellbound for a second by the wonder and mystery of the scene before them - then Challenger explains : &nbsp; CHALLENGER- " The whole plateau must have been thrown up by some titanic upheaval carrying all its prehistoric life up with it ! " BACK - Summerlee looks from the plateau to Challenger in withering contempt , then snorts : &nbsp; SUMMERLEE- " A volcanic upheaval - perhaps ! But prehistoric animals carried up in time , reproducing their kind down to the present day - preposterous ! " BACK - He waves the whole idea aside , repeating : " Preposterous ! " Challenger bellows : &nbsp; CHALLENGER- " Preposterous only to the enfeebled brain of a hidebound coleopterist ! " BACK - Summerlee is stunned - inarticulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MOONLIGHT SHOT - C. V. OF THE APEMAN - squatting in a clump of feathery vegetation , evidently on the edge of the high plateau - peering down onto the plain five hundred feet below . His whole attitude is tense and menacing . ( Note : For this character we use Bull Montana in a makeup something similar to that which he used when he appeared as the ape in Go and Get It with Marshall Neilan . We play him here as the missing link between true ape and primitive man . ) Near him , also crouching in the underbrush , is his mate - a real ape , nearly as large as he is . ( Note : For this we use either Susie or Mary , the big trained apes that give almost human performances on the screen . ) As the apeman squats , shading his keen eyes with both hands , and peering down again - CUT TO 430 .

Roxton , field glasses to eyes , searching every inch of the plateau 's precipitous sides , trying to find any possible way up . Paula is in an emotional mood - her mind full of the possibility that her father may be alive - marooned on the mysterious plateau . She turns to Roxton , saying : SPOKEN TITLE - " Tomorrow we will begin the real search for my father ! " BACK - Paula finishing title , her eyes shining with hope and with tender feeling . Roxton , pointing out the inaccessibility of the sides , exclaims :  --  55  --  &nbsp; ROXTON- " But the sides are absolutely inaccessible - there is no possible way up !

FLASH SHOT WHICH ESTABLISHES THE PRECIPITOUS WALLS OF THE PLATEAU - at the point where a great pinnacle rises beside it - its walls also perpendicular - and practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently been split off from the plateau itself by an earthquake or some such volcanic upheaval . Its top - about twenty feet across - is almost on a level with the plateau but a sheer chasm of some five hundred feet in depth separates the two . On the top of the pinnacle we see a lone tree silhouetted against the faint light of the sky and , near it , the moldering stump of what was once a second tree . 433 . C. V OF PAULA AND ROXTON - as before Paula 's eyes move from the plateau to the pinnacle . Her mood is one of repressed emotionalism . She is on the verge of realization of all her hopes - the outcome of months of fears - terrors - and personal tragedy . Her eyes show traces of tears , her face quivering with nervous fear and excitement . Any disappointment now would throw her into hysterics . She turns to Roxton and says decisively : &nbsp; PAULA- " My father found a way up ! " CUT DIRECT TO 434 . C. U. OF PAULA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - angry - rebellious at the thought of hesitancy by the party about finding some means of ascent . 435 . C. U.

OF THE TWO - as Roxton finishes title and looks back at the plateau - baffled . Paula points to the pinnacle , saying insistently nervously : &nbsp; PAULA- " When we were here before there were then two great trees growing on the crest of the pinnacle - " BACK - Paula still speaking , one trembling hand pointing to the pinnacle . 437 . BACK TO GLASS SHOT OF THE PINNACLE - ( as seen by Paula and Roxton - picturesque - striking - strangely alluring . 438 . C. V. OF PAULA AND ROXTON - as Roxton looks from the pinnacle to Paula . Realizing her overwrought state he tries to calm her , but she exclaims : " Let me explain !

I believe it could be done ! " Paula nods eagerly , then adds , with deep feeling :  --  56  --  &nbsp; PAULA- " My father crossed first - then our cowardly bearers destroyed the bridge to avoid having to follow him leaving him marooned - alone ! " BACK - Roxton much impressed , again exclaims : " By Gad ! " Paula pleads desperately : " I know we could cross as he did - there is still one tree standing up there ! " Roxton takes her trembling hands , exclaiming : " I believe we can ! " Paula is overjoyed . As they exit to tell the others - CUT TO 439 . M. S. OF THE OTHER GROUP - As Paula and Roxton hurry up and Roxton , pointing to the pinnacle starts to outline their plan . 440 . BACK TO C. V. OF APES - the apeman stealthily draws back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantomimes that she is to stay back - his primitive caution , slyness and treachery must be plainly registered . As his keen eyes search the underbrush about him , a vague idea of some means of killing these intruders in his mind , he sees a great rock - huge - heavy - that has lain for long years in the soft mold among the ferns , etc . Slowly an idea takes form in the apeman 's primitive brain . He grunts an order , then slowly starts to move the rock , Mary helping . The weight of the rock , the strength of the pair of apes , and the sense of the implacable , brutal hatred for these men at the foot of the plateau must be strongly registered . 441 . BACK TO C. V. OF PAULA , ED , ROXTON AND THE TWO SCIENTISTS - they are all discussing the idea of repeating Maple White 's experiment - using the remaining tree on the pinnacle - all looking up at the pinnacle , their backs to the plateau . Challenger , much excited at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the morning we will ascend the pinnacle and drop the other tree over ! " 442 .

That rock was aimed with intent to kill ! " BACK - Roxton finishing title . 449 . C. V. OF THE GROUP - they all look at each other in impressed silence . Then , Challenger demands of Summerlee : &nbsp; CHALLENGER- " Now , will you admit that there is life up there ? " 450 . C. U. OF SUMMERLEE - he has weighed this assertion and decides that it is a fairly logical deduction . He says guardedly : &nbsp; SUMMERLEE- " I admit there may be savages up there - but as for any prehistoric animals - absurd ! " 451 . BACK TO GROUP - as Summerlee finishes his title . At this instant a great shadow slowly passes over them . All are filled with a vague sense of horror - look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREAT PTERODACTYL - twenty or thirty feet wing spread - as it lands on the pinnacle , the tips of its wings extending out on each side of it . 453 .

OF CAMP AT SUNRISE - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous , his eyes often turning toward the sky , plateau and pinnacle - his mind full of Pterodactyls . He has been left behind to look out for Austin who is still very shaky with fever , and also because his own useless right arm makes it obviously impossible for him to attempt the ascent of the pinnacle . Austin is sitting on a box near the remains of the morning cook fire . He is very shaky , but is deeply engrossed in fixing up a little portable wireless . As soon as the scene is well in , Zambo disappears into the tent and we - CUT TO  --  59  --  469 . C. U.

OF ZAMBO - as he emerges from tent with glasses , pauses at tent opening - adjusting the glasses to his eyes and training them on the pinnacle . 471 . VIGNETTED SHOT OF TOP OF PINNACLE - as seen by Zambo through the glasses . It is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the Pterodactyl , whose wings more than covered it the night before . Roxton and Ed are chopping at the great tree the only one on the pinnacle . Challenger is standing on the old stump nearby , directing operations - making sure that the tree , when felled , will drop across the chasm , not into it . If a mistake is made , their only hope of getting across to the plateau is gone . Paula is near Challenger . Summerlee , with his pipe in his mouth , is seen poking about with a hand magnifying glass to his eye , bent upon scientific data . ( Note : The stump mentioned marks the place where Maple White felled his tree - bridging across this same chasm some years before . The stump is now weather-worn , rotting away. ) 472 . CLOSER VIEW OF THE GROUP - not vignetted. 473 . C. U. OF PAULA - as she hears little scrambling noise at edge of pinnacle . She turns , and looks in amazement at : 474 . C. U.

With an exclamation of amazement and solicitude , Paula calls Jocko who scampers on up the rock . As Paula picks him up in her arms , petting him , we see that he is very tired and that one of his little hands is sore . Paula , examining Jocko 's little hand , exclaims to Challenger : &nbsp; PAULA- " I told Zambo to keep Jocko down in the camp until we get back tonight ! " BACK - Challenger laughs - says that Jocko is an explorer too - then turns back to Ed and the tree . 476 . M. S. OF ROXTON , CHALLENGER AND ED - Ed at work on the tree , Roxton resting on his axe . Summerlee , with his pipe in his mouth and his magnifying glass to his eye , wanders up . 477 . C. V.

INSERT - Of beetle crawling about on the palm of Summerlee 's hand . 480 . M. S. OF GROUP - Ed looking at the absorbed scientists , shaking his head . Roxton , with a despairing smile , takes Summerlee by the arm and leads him out of the way - and Ed picks up his axe and goes on chopping . Challenger again mounts his stump to direct proceedings and Paula ( with Jocko ) stand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. - getting ready to make the crossing . 481 . C. U. AT CAMP , OF ZAMBO - now sitting on a box at the entrance to the tent , anxiously scanning the sky , the plateau , etc. through field glasses - still looking for Pterodactyls . He suddenly rises - the glasses glued to his eyes - his hands shaking and we - CUT TO 482 . VIGNETTED SHOT OF A BRONTOSAURUS - as seen through Zambo 's glasses . It is browsing on the tops of the trees some distance from the edge of the plateau . ( Note : There must be no large trees less than fifty yards from the edge of the plateau or our party could later effect an escape. ) 483 . BACK TO M. S. OF ZAMBO - his eyes bulging , the field glasses shaking in his hands . With a terrified whoop , he drops the glasses and dives into the tent , head foremost . Austin looks after him , then rises , steadies himself , shades his eyes and gazes at the pinnacle , wondering what Zambo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. S. OF GROUP , ON PINNACLE - gathered about the tree - not having seen the Brontosaurus over on the plateau . The whole party stands with baited breath , watching Ed 's last strokes on the tree terribly tense as the last work is done on the tree and it crashes over - falling directly across the chasm as they had hoped . 485 . C. V. OF THE BRONTOSAURUS - as it hears the crash of the falling tree . It turns its evil head , looking belligerently about , sniffs the air , stretching its neck a little higher and trains its eyes upon - 486 . M. S. OF GROUP , ON PINNACLE - as seen by the Brontosaurus - all are rejoicing over the success of their bridge-making exploit . Challenger half-wild with triumph . Roxton and Ed making sure that the log will not roll . As Ed says that he thinks it is all right and makes a step on it , to test its stability , Challenger waves him aside and says importantly : &nbsp; CHALLENGER- " As the leader of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross over into - THE LOST WORLD ! " BACK - Roxton and Ed try to argue with him , feeling that younger men should test it out first , but Challenger will not be balked . As he starts carefully across the tree-trunk , his eyes fastened on the plateau - apparently without a thought of the chasm which yawns five hundred feet below him , we -  --  61  --  CUT TO 487 . BACK to C. V. OF AUSTIN AND ZAMBO - Austin again busy with his wireless - Zambo is crouching on his haunches in the doorway , looking up at the pinnacle , wondering when his party is coming back - longing for human companionship - his mind still full of prehistoric monsters . He sees Challenger as he steps out onto the log which bridges the chasm between the pinnacle and plateau . As he throws up his hands in amazement - we - CUT TO 488 . L.

BACK TO ZAMBO AND AUSTIN - staring up nervously at Challenger on the log . Zambo snatches up the glasses that he had dropped in the sand beside him and trains them on Challenger . 490 . VIGNETTED C. U. OF CHALLENGER - as seen by Zambo through glasses - he is now on the middle of the bridge . The tree is not very steady - the crossing is extremely perilous . As he reaches the other side , turns and waves his absurd hat in triumph - CUT TO 491 . C. V. OF THE GROUP ON THE PINNACLE - as Roxton is about to cross . Ed stops him . Ed has one end of the rope in his hand . He explains that he will go across with it , making a hand rail for Paula and the others , Roxton agrees . As Ed starts across the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roxton playing it out to him - the others watching breathlessly , we - CUT TO 492 . ANOTHER VIEW OF THE BRONTOSAURUS - somewhat nearer the group this time . Its head emerges above the low trees and it watches these unusual proceedings - alert - nervous - menacing because of its great size . Then its head is withdrawn . Then we see the treetops move and rustle - and we know that the creature is approaching even nearer , but keeping under cover - lured on by its curiosity - held back by its caution . 493 . C. V. IN TANGLE OF LOW SHRUBS OF THE APEMAN - keeping well under cover , his baleful eyes upon the man . Mary is seen a little way behind him . Behind her we glimpse two or three other apes. 494 . M. S. FROM TOP OF PINNACLE - which shows the plateau , pinnacle and the great chasm with the log across it . We see that Ed is just reaching the other side and stands near Challenger holding the rope taut . Roxton , on the pinnacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand rail is thus accomplished . We see Paula start over , all watching with the most intense nervousness , although her grasp on the rope renders her crossing much less dangerous than theirs . Summerlee is standing on the pinnacle with Jocko on his  --  62  --  arm . ( Note : Each man has his own gun , climbing knapsacks , containing several days ' provisions , etc. , etc. on his back . Roxton wears field glasses besides. ) 495 . C. V.

OF ED - holding his end of the rope taut , as he watches Paula crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safety means to him . Standing beside him is Challenger with his hand outstretched toward Paula . Paula comes into the shot , grasps Challenger 's hand - makes the landing in safety . 499 . BACK TO SHOT OF THE APES - watching - grimacing excitedly at each other - evidently much disturbed and antagonized by this intrusion . Both suddenly crane forward with a slightly different expression - a different type of interest - as their eyes fix upon little Jocko - remotely related to their species . ( Two or three other apes still in background. ) 500 . M. S. OF JOCKO - as he scampers across the log to Paula , his favorite . This crossing is " nuts " to him . Summerlee is close behind him - crossing with the detached assurance of a scientist whose mind is trained to more important things than personal danger . When he is nearly at the middle of the log his eyes light upon another little bug or beetle , which is placidly making the crossing with him . The scientist pauses , his eyes glued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as he pauses - his eager eyes glued to the beetle .

He very carefully stoops , one hand on the hand rope , and , with the other , very expertly picks up the beetle . In so doing he nearly loses his balance , teetering in a hair-raising manner over the abyss . 503 . C. V. OF PAULA AND THE GROUP ON THE PLATEAU - holding their breaths - gritting their teeth - as they watch Summerlee teetering on the middle of the bridge . 504 . L. S.

OF THE GROUP - some distance away from their bridge - as they pause to discuss their plan of procedures , Challenger suggesting that they separate into two parties , go in different directions , etc . Roxton , hearing a rustle in the brush along the edge of the plateau , just beyond the log bridge , faces about , then suddenly exclaims : " Good Gad ! " All eyes follow his , and then the group shrinks back instinctively toward cover when they see - their eyes all raised in blank amazement toward - 508 . L. S. NEARER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully revealed for the first time . It comes ambling along the edge of the plateau toward the bridge - its curious eyes trained upon the group which is backing away from it - its long , snake-like neck stretching out toward them - then drawing back - as it moves on toward the bridge . It is a huge creature - 65 feet in all - the tree-ferns and other low trees dwarfed to the size of mere grass in comparison to its bulk . 509 . C. V. OF GROUP - some distance back from the bridge - staring at the Brontosaurus. 510 . C. U. OF ED AND ROXTON - as Ed touches Roxton 's elephant gun , whispering : " Try this on it !

We 'd need a cannon for that baby ! " BACK - Roxton finishing title . 511 . C. U. OF CHALLENGER AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific wonder . Challenger takes his eyes off the monster , casts a triumphant glance at the dumb-founded Summerlee , looks him over from head to foot , then says with a lofty and patronizing smile : &nbsp; CHALLENGER- " You and your beetles ! " BACK - His triumphant sneer turns to a leer of pride as , with an air of personal achievement and possession , he again indicates the sixty-five-foot monster . Summerlee 's eyes squint up and his pipe emits a few extra puffs - but he attempts no defense this time - 512 . C. V. OF JOCKO AT BRIDGE - busily examining leaves , twigs , etc . Missing his friends he glances up and sees : 513 . M. S. OF THE BRONTOSAURUS - ( DOUBLE EXPOSURE ) - now interested in little Jocko . It moves toward him - its long neck extended .

OF BRONTOSAURUS - as it raises its head , dully curious about Jocko , then - its stupid brain forgetting Jocko , it takes a mouthful of leaves off the fallen tree - shifting the head of the tree about with perfect ease . 517 . C. V. AMONG THE TREES OF THE GROUP - watching Jocko and the Brontosaurus with breathless attention - terrified lest the monster , pulling at the leaves and small branches on the head of the fallen tree , should dislodge it . 518 . C. U. OF CHALLENGER AND SUMMERLEE - keenly interested in the Brontosaurus as Challenger whispers : &nbsp; CHALLENGER- " A Brontosaurus , my dear Summerlee - feeding merely on leaves - perfectly harmless !

As we watch it , we see that the tree head is getting closer and closer to the edge of the canyon . The Brontosaurus lifts it again , tugging at a little bunch of leaves - and it drops on the very edge of the canyon - teeters - and goes over . 520 . C. U. FLASH OF THE GROUP ON PLATEAU - looking on in helpless suspense . ( To be cut into scene 519. ) 521 . L. S. FLASH OF THE LOG FALLING 522 .

( This shot should be handled from the point of pictorial beauty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. U. OF GREAT OWL - in low bush at side of swamp , or on a nearby rock . It is staring straight into the camera . As it hoots dolefully - CUT TO 532 . C. V. OF ZAMBO - bending over his little cook fire - as he hears the melancholy and ghostly hooting of the owl , his hand pauses in some arrested action - his eyes roll slowly in the direction of the owl 's hoot - but the rest of his body is still with superstitious fear . 533 . FLASH OF OWL - as it hoots again . 534 . BACK to C. V. OF ZAMBO - as he rolls his eyes from the owl 's direction toward Austin whispering with shaky lips : " Did ya hear it ? " 535 . S. C. U. OF AUSTIN - still full of fever , sitting in his hammock , on the other side of the cook fire . He is scanning the plateau with the glasses - paying no attention to the owl , but , at Zambo 's question he looks over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you never ' eard a howl ' oot ? " 536 . M. S. OF THE TWO - one on either side of the little camp fire , as Austin finishes his question , then turns his glass back to the plateau - slowly completing the survey of it . Suddenly the glass stops . Austin has evidently seen something . 537 . C. U. OF AUSTIN - as he sees the smoke on the plateau , registering his surprise and tension . 538 . C. U. OF ZAMBO - watching Austin - his eyes bulging - his lips quivering with fright - as he demands in a hoarse whisper : &nbsp; ZAMBO- " What 's you all lookin ' at ? Anoder ob dem debble-birds ? "  --  66  --  BACK - Austin shakes his head impatiently , adjusting the glasses ' focus - as he steadies the glass again , we - CUT TO 539 . VIGNETTED SHOT - as seen through Austin 's field glasses - of a slender column of smoke as it rises from among the trees , well back from the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It increases slightly in size as we watch it - as if a camp fire were just getting well started . 540 . S. C. U. OF THE TWO MEN - their eager faces illuminated by the light from their little cook fire , their eyes on the column of smoke . Austin , indicating the smoke , says eagerly : SPOKEN TITLE - That means our folks is still alive !

" 541 . M. C. U. AS ZAMBO FINISHES TITLE - he rolls his eyes again - and goes on stirring . ( Note : Tent has been set up again - the apeman 's great rock lying near it . Austin 's little wireless also is in evidence in this shot - the receiver , however , is set up in the tent on a box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tent is up. ) 542 . M. S. OF CAMP ON PLATEAU - here we see our party , well in toward the center of the plateau , camping near a huge Gingko tree . They have made a small fire , and have erected a rough barricade of thorn bushes , as is done in the African brush . They have no water except what is in their canteens . Roxton is stooping over the fire , cooking a hare on an improvised spit . Ed is sitting on a rock near enough to the fire to see to write in his notebook - his report to McArdle . Challenger is still working on the thorn-bush barricade , which is higher than his head . He regards it with great satisfaction . A little way from the fire , Paula is unpacking one of the knapsacks - laying out some canned provisions - arranging them on a fairly flat stone which they intend to use for their supper table . Summerlee is happily poking about for beetles , glass in hand . The guns belonging to the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Note : This tree is far higher than the other forest trees in the neighborhood . Parts of it thickly foliaged - but there are some dying , the whole tree being infested with great clumps of mistletoe , a parasite . It is a picturesque and grotesque picture in the moonlight . Run established shot long enough to register then - CUT TO 543 . C. V. OF ROXTON AND ED AS ABOVE - Roxton busy cooking the rabbit , glances over at Ed once or twice , then asks genially : &nbsp; ROXTON " Love letter to the fair Gladys ? "  --  67  --  CUT TO 544 . C. U. OF PAULA - as she hears Roxton 's question . Her rather tense attitude reveals the fact that she is waiting in some anxiety to hear Ed 's reply . 545 . BACK TO ED AND ROXTON - as Ed shakes his head , then says tersely : &nbsp; ED " Usual report to Mr. McArdle . " BACK - Ed returns to his report . 546 . C. U. OF PAULA - as she registers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks this emotion as unworthy - sighs and goes on with her work . 547 . BACK TO ED AND ROXTON - Ed busily writing , Roxton 's eyebrows go up - he neatly turns the roasting rabbit , being an expert in campfire cooking - then looks over at Ed , asking dryly : &nbsp; ROXTON " How do you expect to send it ? Zambo and Austin could never find their way back alone . If they could - we might hope for reinforcements . " BACK - Ed nods , agreeing to this last - but goes on writing . Roxton turns the rabbit , then adds : &nbsp; ROXTON " - and we 'll never get back , young fellah-my-lad ! We 're trapped up here for life - if we live ! " BACK - As he finishes title . Ed looks toward him , saying in an undertone : " Shut up , ca n't you ? " Looks significantly toward Paula , whom he does not want unduly depressed by Roxton 's dry statement of their case . As Roxton follows Ed 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As both look again at Paula - CUT TO 548 . C. V. OF PAULA - busy with the provisions at the rock . She has the canteens . Shakes one , decides there is enough water for their frugal meal , puts it in the middle of the rock , and carefully puts the others to one side for safekeeping . 549 . BACK TO C. U. OF THE MEN - as they look from Paula , then at each other , an odd look comes into both pairs of eyes . Unconsciously they are measuring and testing each other - the old primitive challenge between two men where a woman is concerned . They hold this a second . Ed closes his notebook , puts it into his pocket - hesitates a second , rises and deliberately saunters over toward Paula - Roxton watching him in grim silence . 550 . C. V. OF PAULA AND CHALLENGER - Challenger turns from his thornbush barrier , surveys it with great pride , then says to Paula : &nbsp; CHALLENGER " We can eat in peace , my dear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the elephant and lion country . " BACK - He pats Paula 's shoulder reassuringly .  --  68  --  551 . C. U. HIGH UP IN GINGKO TREE OF APEMAN - silently peering down at the camp below . He is practically hidden in the tree 's thick maiden hair fern-like foliage - and he is inside the barrier . 552 . FLASH OF CHALLENGER AND PAULA - near rock ( as seen by the apeman ) Challenger proudly discussing his barricade . As Ed joins Paula - CUT TO 553 . BACK TO C. U. OF APEMAN - as he withdraws his eyes from the camp below - and cautiously starts to descend tree . A small branch snaps - he freezes - motionless - alert . 554 . C. U. OF ROXTON - tending the roasting rabbit but his eyes wander restlessly forward : 555 . C. V. OF ED AND PAULA AS ABOVE - Paula finishes her task and starts leaning against the rock , lost in thought - her eyes wistfully searching the surrounding darkness - her thoughts on her father . Ed watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking of , Paula - in this Lost World of ours ? " BACK - Paula turns her eyes slowly toward him and replies quite simply : &nbsp; PAULA " I was thinking that my father may see our fire - " 556 . C. U. OF PAULA - as she finishes her title - her eyes flood with tears . 557 . C. V. OF THE TWO - Ed 's eyes are sympathetic - he has no idea of robbing her of her hope , and yet hesitates to bolster it up falsely . Without speaking , he lays his hand over Paula 's as it rests on the edge of the stone . Paula 's eyes waver a trifle under this contact , then she gently removes her hand , turns slightly away . There is a pause - full of unacknowledged feeling on both sides - then , to break the tension , Ed makes some laughing remarks about her table arrangements . 558 . M. C. V. ZAMBO 'S CAMP - Austin , sitting in his hammock rises carefully - his legs very unsteady and weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter dishes out his stew . As they start to eat - CUT TO 559 . M. C. V.

OF JOCKO - as he comes limping in - very tired and lame from his ascent and descent of the five hundred foot high pinnacle . As he reaches out his hand and takes hold of Zambo 's leg , to climb up - CUT TO 561 . C. U. OF ZAMBO - as he feels " something " take hold of his leg . He freezes in terror , then relaxes into a hearty laugh as little Jocko climbs into his lap , holding up one lame hand . Zambo examines it , then says to Austin :  --  69  --  &nbsp; ZAMBO " He follow Miss Paula clar up dat big rock dis mo'nin ' - he cai n't bear dat gal outen his sight !

" BACK - Austin finishes title . Indicates the hammocks belonging to the party , still hanging under the nearby palm tree . 563 . M. C. U. OF THE TWO - as Zambo stares from Austin to the hammocks and back and then demands : &nbsp; ZAMBO " You all goin ' to sleep in all dem hammocks ? " BACK - Zambo finishing title . Austin waves this aside - then earnestly outlines his " hidea " as they eat . 564 . M. S. OF THE PLATEAU CAMP - including the Gingko tree , the cook fire and the table . As Roxton approaches the " table " carrying the sizzling hot rabbit on its spit , Paula gaily indicates a big leaf which is to be their platter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Paula to sit on , then sits beside her . Summerlee saunters up to join them , then pauses behind Ed and trains his glass upon an object on the back of Ed 's neck . 565 . S. C. U. OF SUMMERLEE - as he stands behind Ed - completely lost in enraptured study of the object on the back of Ed 's neck . As he leans a trifle nearer , peering through his glass - INSERT - C. U. of huge wood-tick on the back of Ed 's bare neck . Ed 's hand comes into the insert , nervously brushing it off . 566 . C. U. OF ED AND SUMMERLEE - as Ed brushes off the tick , Summerlee exclaims in pained disappointment - peers down among the leaves and ferns - then looks at Ed with stern disapproval : &nbsp; ED " Through your careless haste a wood-tick of an as yet unclassified species has been lost to science ! " CUT DIRECT TO 567 . M. C. U. OF ED , SUMMERLEE AND PAULA - Paula turns to hide her smile . Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclaims with acute disgust : &nbsp; ED " The filthy vermin was making a meal off of me ! " BACK - turn as they hear Challenger laughing . 568 . M. S. OF ENTIRE GROUP - Challenger laughing heartily over the entire episode . Summerlee sitting down to eat his belated supper , shaking his head in deep  --  70  --  disapproval over the loss of the tick . 569 . C. U. OF CHALLENGER - as he suppresses his laughter , then says in his patronizing manner : &nbsp; CHALLENGER " To a philosopher there are no filthy vermin my dear Ed . Personally I consider a wood-tick as beautiful a work of nature as an - orchid ! " BACK - He finishes title and goes on expounding in his most toploftical strain . 570 . C. U. OF ED - listening to Challenger in respectful silence , nodding his head in bland shirt being open at the throat ) . INSERT - Of a tick crawling on Challenger 's hair-matted chest . As the tick starts downward : BACK - Ed , still agreeing , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as one has just disappeared inside your shirt , headed south . " 571 . M. S. OF GROUP - as Ed finishes title - Challenger gets the full significance of it . With a wild yell , he springs to his feet , tearing blindly at his shirt , trying to get it off - the others convulsed . 572 . INT . TENT - ZAMBO 'S CAMP - wireless set up on box in corner . Austin sitting on specimen case . The light from the fire shines in at the fly , which is raised . Austin has also lighted a candle near him . Jocko is much in evidence . Austin is busily unraveling a hammock . Zambo enters , carrying three more . As he dumps them on the floor , Austin nods his approval . Zambo sits on another specimen case and begins to unravel the hammock nearest to him . Both working with much intensity , Jocko helping them . Zambo asks : " But how we goin ' to get all dis up to ' em , boss ? " Austin replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my legs is still shaky with fever - we ca n't climb that rock - but Jocko can ! " BACK - Looks over at monkey . Zambo also looks at monkey , thinking this out . As little Jocko blinks up at them wisely - CUT TO 573 . C. U. OF LITTLE JOCKO - as he blinks up at the men . 574 . BACK TO GROUP , AROUND ROCK ON PLATEAU - enjoying the rabbit - Roxton finishing some amusing remark , all laughing at it - the men deliberately making an effort to keep Paula 's spirits up . ( Note : The director should play this scene with that thought in mind , but should be careful not to overdo it , not make the group hilarious , or strain for an effect - and under all the effort to " play the game " in a sportsmanlike manner , we must feel the tension and strain , the watchful alertness , the controlled nerves of every member of the party except Summerlee , whose mind dwells placidly in the realm of beetles. )  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade from every face - and the whole group is absolutely motionless . There is a tense pause , then all look at each other in silence - rise and instinctively move backward toward the fire - all eyes turned toward the barrier . It is too high for them to see over - but they know something is approaching their stronghold . 575 . REVERSE CAMERA SHOT - following the eyes of the silent group , now near the protection of the fire . The barrier looms seven feet in the air , the moonlit forest showing behind it . Apparently all is peaceful - then two baleful eyes appear in the gloom , getting larger and larger as they approach the barrier . They belong to a huge Allosaurus - the most vicious animal of the ancient world . While we still can only sense the creature - only its blazing eyes being plainly discernible - CUT TO 576 . C. U. OF THE ALLOSAURUS ' VICIOUS FACE 577 . C. V. OF GROUP - gazing spell-bound at the slowly approaching monster . Then , at a low word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quietly as possible - remaining close to the protection of the fire - praying that the thorn barrier will turn the creature aside . 578 . C. U.

To think that we should actually see it ! " BACK - Challenger finishing title . Summerlee again nods - but raises Challenger 's sagging gun - training it and his own on the monster . 579 . REVERSE CAMERA SHOT - of the slowly approaching Allosaurus - its head appearing high above the barrier . 580 . C. V. OF THE GROUP - Roxton , the hunter , in command , says sharply : &nbsp; ROXTON " Hold your fire until the last moment - " BACK - Others nod , Ed puts Paula behind the fire near the trunk of the big Gingko tree - the fire between her and the monster - then rejoins the others - the guns trained on the barrier . 581 . REVERSE CAMERA SHOT - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorn barrier - then moves slowly forward , its snaky head reaching out toward the men , its eyes vicious .

The vicious face and slobbering mouth are horribly illuminated by the fire for an instant . 590 . L. S. - DOUBLE EXPOSURE - of Allosaurus and Ed and group . The beast 's jaws crash shut on the brand and with a bellow of pain the creature turns and makes off , frantically shaking its head free of the flaming fragments of the brand . 591 . SHOT IN FOREST - following the Allosaurus as it flees. 592 . BACK TO GROUP - Ed picking up his gun . The others join him - all very much shaken , but all impressed with his fine presence of mind and daring . Ed says modestly : " It was just a chance - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of earshot so far as Paula is concerned . 593 . C. U. OF ROXTON AND ED - as they pause , a little apart from the others and Ed says quietly : &nbsp; ED " The barrier might as well be thistle-down - and fire may not work with the next one - we 've got to find a safe camp !

A huge Triceratops appears , attracted by the uproar , but keeping a safe distance . The Allosaurus is gradually forcing the Trachodon out into the lake as they fight - now apparently in six or eight feet of water - finally succeeding in tearing open the Trachodon 's throat . The wounded creature jerks itself free , backing away , toward the center of the lake - receives another deep wound in the neck , this time severing the jugular vein . With a final convulsive stagger , it backs unsteadily into deeper water , wavers , sinks down and finally disappears , the waters of the lake closing over it .

FADE OUT SLOW FADE IN Section Details 640 . L. S. OF THE LAKE , THE CAVES , ETC. - DAYLIGHT - the sun sparkling on the wind-rippled water - the whole scene suggesting peace and security - no monsters nor other terrifying things in sight . Near the margin of the lake , not far from the caves , two or three sturdy saplings are growing . Challenger is prowling about these saplings , examining them with thoughtful care - evidently working out some idea of his own . Near the group of saplings is a neck of the big woods , encircling this end of the lake . 641 . M. S. OF THE LAKE - including Challenger , the group of saplings and the mouth of one of the caves , which is some twenty feet above the ground , in the face of the perpendicular cliff which rises from the margin of the lake at this point . In this closer view we see that a rough substitute for a ladder is propped against the cliff , giving access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been roughly constructed by chipping footholds in a sapling and propping it against the entrance to the cave , its foot firmly planted in the sand to steady it . It is little more than a good-sized pole , and speaks forcibly of the haste and stress and strain  --  77  --  under which this means of reaching the safe shelter of the cave was devised . As soon as this shot is established we see Summerlee - smoking his eternal pipe - poke his head out of this cave and gaze curiously down at Challenger . 642 . C. V. AT MOUTH OF CAVE OF SUMMERLEE - pipe in mouth , as he gazes down at Challenger . 643 . C. V. OF CHALLENGER - testing the strength and resilience of one of the larger saplings by bending it downward - letting it fly back into place . 644 . C. V.

OF SUMMERLEE - gingerly working his way down the pole , his pipe clutched grimly between his teeth , his cap firmly jammed down over his ears to prevent the wind from blowing it off . 646 . M. S. INT . OF CAVE - ( Now revealed for the first time . It is rather large , being weatherworn in soft sandstone . About ten feet back from the entrance we see daylight sifting down from a cleft in the cave 's roof - a natural shaft leading to the surface of the ground , far above . Below this opening , on the floor of the cave which is here high enough for a man to stand erect , we see a rough circle of stones - the remains of a crude hearth . An accumulation of ashes and the smoke grime about the edge of the entrance to the shaft above , are unmistakable evidence of a former human inhabitant but the ashes show that many rains have fallen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soot .

Both of these passages are dark . ) Paula is kneeling near the deserted hearth . Near her , stacked against the wall of the cave , are knapsacks and guns , etc. , belonging to the party . Beside her is a little pile of twigs , small branches and tufts of dry grass . She is laying a little fire on the cold ashes . 647 . C. U. OF PAULA AS ABOVE - she is deeply moved - sure that this deserted hearth was once used by her father . She puts her hand on one of the stones - lovingly - thoughtfully - then looks up at the shaft over her head - the light filtering down , illuminating her features . 648 . C. V.

Ed enters realizes Paula 's intention , and protests quickly : " You ca n't go out alone , Paula ! " 654 . S. C. U. OF THE TWO - as Ed finishes speaking , his hand on Paula 's arm .

Challenger smiles triumphantly as he gets his jack-knife out of his pocket , opens it , and starts off toward a group of larger trees from which hang many lianas. 658 . C. V. BY LARGER TREES - whose branches are swaying in the breeze . Challenger enters scene , the open jack-knife in his hand , examines the lianas - tests one with his weight , seems satisfied and starts to work on it with his knife .

Standing , gazing about in amazement , is Roxton - an electric torch in his hand . He holds it up , its light making the stalactites sparkle and dilate . He discovers a little alcove over to one side , nearly hidden by stalagmites , and moves over toward it , flashing his light all about him as he sees : 660 . C. U. ON FLOOR OF CAVE - of an old rifle - the light from the torch playing over it . 661 . C. V.

OF THE SKULL - as Roxton 's hand slowly turns it over - revealing a jagged , ghastly hole in the back of it . 670 . C. U.
