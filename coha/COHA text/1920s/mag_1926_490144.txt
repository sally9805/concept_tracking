IN THIS commercial age , anything free deserves prominent mention . We refer , in this instance , to a free show which has recently been instituted by a dentist on Park Avenue not far from the Vanderbilt Hotel . He has obligingly leased the ground floor of one of the remodeled houses in that section , and when the steam heat is working , opens the window and permits passers-by to inspect his patient . It is an excellent idea . THE RACE to win the favor of the upper-wealthy is still on , with Abercrombie Fitch , Brooks Brothers , and Tiffany 's in the lead . Brooks Brothers recently forged ahead with a recherche implement for spat-wearers called an unbuttonhook , which is like a buttonhook , only different . Then Abercrombie drew even with a left-handed corkscrew for sinistral drinkers that is every bit as exotic . Tiffany 's , however , at the present writing has gained a lap on both of them by ornamenting the big steel clock next their elevator with a sign reading , " Two seconds fast .

But the fact is that on First Avenue near Thirteenth Street there is a Kale Club . The Post Office is sufficiently hard pressed to keep things straight as it is without r having to contend with confusions like this . One club or the other must give way . MUCH praise must go to the Anti- Fifth Avenue Association for its notable accomplishment on Madison Square For many weeks now the association has succeeded in keeping the Avenue above Twenty-third Street torn up in an impressive manner . All attempts to get the section paved have so far been defeated , and at the present writing , officials say they have every hope of keeping things as they are until after Christmas . WE ARE continually hearing in- dignant persons anathematize the Graphic as having raised the art of bad taste to the nth power by its manner of handling the recent Browning marital adventure . And as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the phrases of special meaning which has suddenly become part of the vocabulary of the millions . The millions being what they are , it is doubtful whether the phrase has any meaning any more ; and it is certain that it has none when applied to the policies of the Graphic just as it would have none if applied to the table manners of Mexican peons . The Graphic and the peons are quite worthy in their way , and so are Mr. Browning and his child-wife , both of whom seemsomewhat indifferent as to whether their pictures appear in yellow sheets or not , but talking of them in terms of good or bad taste is ridiculous . The fact is that anyone who is interested in following the psychological development of New York and the American nation should keep an eye on Mr. Macfadden . He is much more significant in this connection than the editor of the New York Times .

" Reflection COWBOYS who have come on for the annual Rodeo arc to be seen about the streets , thus recalling an incident of three or four years ago . It seems that the vaqueros are a hardy lot inclined , despite prohibition , to paint the town red when they are paid off at the end of the round-up .

" exclaimed the doctor , " you have two broken ribs . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I had had a pain in my side ever since the show closed , but I thought it was the climate . " Old New York NEW YORK  --  or some of it ? had a delightful time this week reviving the small-town spirit with a charming exhibition of itself at the Fine Arts Building at 215 West Fifty-seventh Street . The exhibition will be on till Sunday evening , when the objects on view will he returned to their owners . It is still true that if you scratch an old New Yorker you find a Victorian  --  and there was a sweet Victorianism rampant on the opening day . The list of patronesses was gigantic , and a goodly proportion were on hand . " Come and see my sofa and the shell picture Aunt Matilda made when she was a little girl . " Lo and behold , there they were , scorned for generations , suddenly blossoming into museum pieces . Almost everything had been lent by patronesses  --  at least almost everything in the big room had . In the first room were floral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our island ; and a collection of playbills and theatrical costumes  --  which did not come from the best homes . In another room were prints , beautiful prints of everything  --  hotels , theatres , the harbor , famous fires and famous parades , aII of an age that , exteriorly speaking , is as distant as the eleventh century . And on a screen in the center were photographs of modern architecture . The large room at the end is where the real New Yorkers gather , and where the best of the collection is displayed  --  costumes , ship models , portraits , silver , china , maps and furniture . On the opening day , the owners of the furniture stood by benignly watching the crowd with legitimate self-satisfaction . It is too bad they could n't be present all week , for they add a small-town , rummage-sale atmosphere that was delightful . In becoming a metropolis , New York has paid rather a heavy price . THE REASON for it all is that the Museum of the City of New York , as we pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new life in its home in the old Gracie Mansion . It has changed directors and decided to add to its collection , and , in fact , to build a new museum . At the time of writing , this is unofficial , but it is a logical movement , as people do n't lend or give their things for exhibition in the Gracie Mansion , which is n't fire-proof . The hope is that many people about the city will say , " Oh , yes , I 've got an old Franklin stove I do n't use . I think I 'll give it to the museum . " The scheme ought to work ; certainly no New York family exists that has n't some useless heirloom in the hall closet . If we could be persuaded to disgorge , New York could fit itself with a really fine museum . Progress is working the devil with us , and we ought to have a place to put the nicest of our things before they are washed out to sea , together with the crackerjack boxes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to recount how Mr. Walter Wanger , having smashed five Italian airplanes while being instructed in flying on the Italian front during the war , became known as the great Austrian ace . We wrote " American , " however , instead of " Austrian " and were pointless . Several alienists have told us that such slips , while not uncommon , are , nevertheless , a bad sign . ? THE NEWSPAPERS having been negligent in the matter , we report , even thus belatedly , what we learned from a lady who has the distinction of having had a shampoo from the very hands which shampooed the Queen of Roumania . She tells us that the permanent wave the Queen got in Paris a few weeks ago did the royal hair no good . It is broken , and so forth . Also we learn that Her Majesty 's tiaras all are too large for her since she got her hob . Going , Going ? THE AUCTION season is on in I earnest , with almost daily sales in all of the leading galleries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that hard future winter when they will have bought all the art treasures in existence . A dealer has confided some facts which we consider interesting . He says that eighty or ninety per cent of our important buyers attend the auctions in person . Sometimes the buying is done through an agent or dealer who may know more than the buyer about authenticity , but even then the millionaire himself is usually present . In fact , attending auctions seems to be the favorite indoor sport among our plutocrats . William Randolph Hearst , it appears , is the Barnum and Bailey collector of New York . He collects everything , and has it stored until he can think of a place to put it . Sometimes he has to wait until he builds another house . Much of the treasure he accumulates is shipped in carload lots to California , where he has some thirty or forty houses , including the various ones on his enormous ranch . Other of the big collectors are interested in special fields . Clarence Mackay , for instance , specializes in armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persian art ; Joseph Widener in paintings ; Huntington , of THE NEW YORKER CURSE OF THE OPERA MOUSE - t=f11 AY AMOUR tHILDRENIE ACROBATS " ' =ENGRAVED BY JOHN HELD JR , AND SUCH AM ENGRAVING OH MY & --  -- ; ? Course , in hooks . Mr. Huntington , by the way , started his famous library by buying at auctions , and still augments it in that way . Mr. E. B. Springs , the cotton broker , like Mr. Hearst , buys everything ; and it is said that he has nothing in his house on Forty-seventh Street not bought at auction . Jules S. Bache is one of the most recent buyers to take up auctions as a hobby , and Owen D. Young is prominent among the book buyers . WHAT with the Leverhulme auc- tion , the present season is not expected to be as exciting as last year , but there is a report that there may he another sensational millionand-a-half dollar sale later on . The most interesting offering thus far scheduled is a collection of arms and armor said to be the largest assemblage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire contents of a castle in Hohenwerfen Forest , Austria . It is on the ocean now , and is due to arrive at the Anderson Gallery soon . It was the property of His Imperial and Royal Highness , the Archduke Eugene , great-great-grandson of the famous Marie Theresa , mother of two Emperors and of Marie Antoinette . Eugene is a brother of the Queen-mother of Spain , and uncle of the present King Alfonso XIII . A single piece from this collection a Spanish cannon of the eighteenth century  --  required a regiment of 750 men to carry it up to the Archduke 's castle when it was installed there . And when removed , it had to he lowered with chains and pulleys over the cliff on which the castle stands . Auction experts tell us that , for the most part , only European collections will be up for sale this season . So general is the practice in this country of giving or leaving collections to museums that there are practically no American collections left for auctions . Art OUR LATEST advices from Hollywood concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which event a moving picture actress , in person , had been posted at the microphone to render description to the air .

Memories of countless parties about town , with the little dark man always in the background but always with a fascinated group about him , now wrenching his thumb from its socket and returning it , now disgorging a pack of threaded needles , now dazing the reverent circle by swallowing a sword . Quiet , modest , unassuming and startlingly gifted by nature , he was always obliging , always likable and always daring beyond belief . A million columns have been written of him as a showman . A thousand times he had faced death . Padlocked and nailed in packing-boxes and dropped into the sea , riveted into water-boilers , nailed into hermetically sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suspended head down from dizzy skyscrapers , the broad Slavonic visage of Houdini had met death in rendezvous which grew monotonous . Recently he had turned his inquisitive mind and penetrating showman 's eyes upon a subject which had haunted him all his life  --  life beyond the grave . Seven times he had made compacts in all seriousness with persons who agreed to communicate from the grave if it were possible after their death . None of the seven came back . NOW he is gone , and in a small brownstone house at No. 278 West 113th Street , the dust gathers on much unfinished work . The many rooms of that house are lined and piled ceiling-high with stacks of hooks , paper wrappings and crumbling envelopes in which are held the records , experiences and secrets of fifty-two years of the life of the boy Eric Veiss , son of a rabbi of Appleton , Wisconsin , who developed into the mystic who branded himself with the title trickster , a magician who gave the principal credit for his art to the fact that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined in his personality the ego of Barnum , the pose of Belasco , and a talent for publicity that was unique . How many of the secrets of his work will come from those archives waits the future ; at present it is a lonely castle without the spirit of the master . ? ? Meanest Man T ria . SEASON of drives is on , to be led off apparently by the Y. W. C. A. , and we are reminded of an incident in their campaign last year when a gentleman of prominence was asked for a reasonable sum for this women 's club . He told a sad tale of had business , sickness in family and what not , and wound up eloquently , " Why , I 've even talked of resigning from one of my clubs . " Subsequently it was disclosed that he was a member of five metropolitan and four country clubs and , mercifully , the matter was not pressed .

" Subsequently , we are told , eight or nine of the leading evangelists of the city united to tender Mr. Lewis a banquet , which grew into a weekly meeting at which the Kansas City worthies listened to Mr. Lewis ' attacks with rapt attention  --  and made them into sermons for the following Sunday . So great was the stimulus that Kansas City was said to have undergone a great religious revival . Take this with or without a dash of salt . ? HOT SPRINGS is going to have an unusual guest this year , an elephant is already on his way for a winter of recuperation there . It seems that he was imported from India for a Cincinnati gentleman , but the poor beast lost 1500 pounds en route and , like other careful citizens , is taking his doctor 's advice in retiring to the resort . Bed Time Story WITH CHILL , damp winds be- coming more and more unpleasant , yacht-owners are putting their charges to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on City Island , in the Brooklyn yards , one can see them hauling their prizes up sliding " ways " out of the water , hammering together wooden frame-works , affectionately called " cradles , " tucking the boats up in canvas sheets or under wooden comforters . Soon the pampered darlings , whose active year is three months , will slumber peacefully until painting time in the Spring . Of course , there are a few exceptions . Perhaps the largest and best known yacht in the harbor is J. P. Morgan 's Corsair . It is not hauled out of the water at all , but winters in the basin at Stonington , Conn . The Corsair and other large ones , such as General Cornelius Vanderbilt 's At- ! antic , always keep a skeleton crew on board all winter , whether in dry dock or sheltered basin . This may be composed of the skipper , first matc and engineer , or simply of a sailor caretaker . Arthur Curtis James ' dloha , a bark with an auxiliary engine , is generally not put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  having spent the past few winters in the Carrihean . Since these boats that arc in use only three months of the year have summer crews , ranging from fifty or sixty ( as in the case of the Corsair ) to two or three men , the question arises as to what becomes of these sailors in winter . The answer seems to be thatthe ordinary deck hands are apt to he found almost anywhere on the Island as janitors , coal-wagon drivers , snow-shovelers ; that the chefs get jobs in apartment kitchens ; and that the real sailors ( which includes many of the skippers ) have boats of their own down along the coast of Florida , where they take tourists out cruising realtors out fishing and ( perhaps ) ad venturous souls to the three-mile-limit .

The customs inspector had the bad taste to discover the bottle just as a Prohibition agent wandered past ; and the traveler was confronted with failure to declare the liqueur and violation of the Eighteenth Amendment . " That is n't liquor , " he said . " It 's over a hundred years old . It 's an antique . " His story is , he got away with it .
