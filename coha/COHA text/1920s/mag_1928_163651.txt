Kansas City was plastered with posters asking : " Who but Hoover ? " At an elevator near the Beaver Man 's headquarters in the Baltimore Hotel , one of these posters was just above a larger sign- " HOOVER " - with an arrow pointing the way . <P> A few hours after the arrival of the Pennsylvania delegation , a wag altered the " b " in " but " on the poster and scratched out two letters of the big sign below . The change was slight , but now the signs posed one of the most intimate questions of the convention : " Who put Hoover OVER ? " <P> After he was " over , " Hoover 's head quarters admitted the bold extent to which they had bluffed in their pre-convention claims about delegates . They admitted that the arrival of the big and baffling Pennsylvania delegation was like the night before Christmas . New York and Massachusetts would do as Pennsylvania did and that would decide matters . Discovering what Pennsylvania would do was like peeping up the chimney for Santa Claus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney , and whom a nettled press credited with being the real though surprising Santa Claus , was not the frosted patrician , the supposedly all-potent Secretary Mellon . It was sooty and corpulent William S. Vare , the Philadelphia boss whom the U. S. Senate has suspected of , and rejected for , corruption . <P> Secretary Mellon had descended from his train nervously , shyly , and hurried to shut himself in a hotel suite . He was clinging to his maxim , " There 's luck in leisure . " Also , obviously , he was under great pressure to draft President Coolidge if possible . He had learned , or accepted , nothing final before leaving Washington. * He still sought conference with other leaders before speaking . <P> Senator-suspect Vare , on the other hand , strutted down the station platform with his nose turned up even higher than usual , ready for business . A newsman asked him where Mr. Vare was . <P> " I am Senator Vare , " replied the Senator-suspect . <P> It was after Mr. Vare heard that Secretary Mellon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience and importance . He issued a statement of his own which said : " The Republicans of Pennsylvania , in my judgment , are for Herbert Hoover . . . . " <P> In the Mellon suite conferences on drafting Coolidge continued to a negative conclusion . Next day , when Secretary Mellon endorsed Hoover at the Pennsylvania caucus and Boss Vare got a resolution passed alleging his right to a seat in the Senate , f newsmen snorted abusively that the Pittsburgh patrician 's course had been dictated by the Philadelphia politician , that Secretary Mellon had been timid and vacillating , that his control of Pennsylvania was a myth , that Boss Vare was Boss indeed and that Hooverism had Boss Vare to thank for its deciding boost . As added evidence of the supremacy of Vare over Mellon , observers recalled that President William Wallace Atterbury of the Pennsylvania R. R. , a Vare familiar , had been made National Committeeman from Pennsylvania instead of Senator Reed , the obedient Mellon man . For explanation of Vare animus toward Secretary Mellon it was recalled that George Wharton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vare for the Senate in 1926 , and that far more money was spent for Pepper than for Vare in the slushy campaign for which Vare was later rejected at the Capitol .
