txt This is a , great - day , for the United States in the Arctic . Rivalries are forgotten I in the general rejoicing in the safe ending of the dangerous flight of Commander Byrd . Among the first to congratulate him was Captain Amundsen , who , rushing from his dinner , ran up the long hill and pantingly threw his arms about the tired Commander . " That is magnificent , wonderful ! I 'm so happy ! " said Captain Amundsen , hugging the smaller Byrd and kissing him as he placed his arm around his shoulders , holding him to him . Mr. Ellsworth was less demonstrative , but forgot his shyness as he pushed forward and held out his hand . " I congratulate you , Commander . Splendidly done ! " Dramatic Close of the Flight . The return came dramatically and suddenly at the end of an anxious day , for no signals had been identified by the American wireless operators after 4 o'clock in the morning , and anxiety was prevalent that something had happened . The Norge 's operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , but nothing afterward . Commander Byrd was not expected to arrive before 7 o'clock tonight . All the Norge 's crew and the others of the expedition were at dinner save two or three scanning the hills before going in . All was quiet on the Chantier and none of her crew was ashore . In the Norge 's mess hall Captain Amundsen , Mr. Ellsworth and the others were ranged about the big tables finishing their soup , When the cry came " Byrd is coming ! " They had been talking of his start with admiration , for it still seemed he had been gone only a short while . At the cry every one sprang up , overturning the benches and forgetting hats , and with shouts of joy ran outdoors . Sure enough , high over the hills on the other side of the bay a tiny speck showed the returning wings of the Fokker , darker blue against the pale blue sky . The hum of the motors was faintly heard  --  the sturdy motors which bore Commander Byrd and Pilot Bennett safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirring smoothly and tirelessly . As the plane rapidly grew larger it turned southward over the bay in huge circles over the glaciers , then turned back northward over the mountains . The hillside , lately deserted , was now dotted with figures running up toward the slope where the airplane would probably land , jumping up and down with joy , shaking hands and patting backs . The whistle of the Chantier suddenly bellowed forth and was then tied down . While the Heimdal 's siren blew , over the side of the Chantier tumbled hurrying figures , dropping down the rope ladder to reach the shore . Commander Byrd flew the plane in lower circles for about ten minutes , showing plenty of gas was left , and indulging for a few moments in his delightful triumph . Once he flew low over the heads of a crowd of men who threw their hats into the air in welcome . Then he turned in a long sweeping circle and came low again . As Commander Byrd then dropped toward the landing , Captain Amundsen , running up the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happy as I am over this . I am so glad I " The memory of his heart-breaking experience last year when he was lost for three weeks with a wrecked plane on the ice and the knowledge of the dangers Byrd faced gave to him and Mr. Ellsworth a full appreciation of Byrd 's achievement . " Nobody would begrudge him a moment of this , " said Mr. Ellsworth heartily . " He has earned it . " Even Riiser-Larsen , pilot of one of the planes last year , usually taciturn and silent , smiled approval as he bit off a chew of tobacco . Fliers Worn Out by Long Strain . When Commander Byrd landed there was a moment to wait while the two weary figures in the plane stretched their muscles and shook hands . It was their first moment of relaxation since the take-off . So long did they wait that a young member of the crew tore open the door , rushed in and met Commander Byrd stiffly moving between the huge gas tanks toward the door of the fuselage . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he cried . THE NEW YORK TIMES representative was the second to grip Commander Byrd 's hand and then Pilot Bennett 's . The eyes of both men were weary , their bodies sagging with fatigue . As they stepped out the crowd met them , threw their arms about them , lifted them on their ' shoulders and carried them a little way down the hill , where Captain Amunasen rushed up to congratulate Commander Byrd . When Mr. Ellsworth expressed his joy at their return , Commander Byrd smiled and said : " It is Bennett . He did it . " Bennett , so tired he could hardly speak , said all he wanted was sleep . Man after man rushed up , the Norwegians , congratulating in broken English , beaming happily at the end of an adventure their Northern hearts could so readily appreciate . Then Byrd and Bennett turned and walked down hill , led by Amundsen and Ellsworth . They got into a little boat which put out to the ship as the crew of the Heimdal lined the rail , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When they reached the ship the whole crew , many still unshaven and hardly rested from their terrific labors in getting the ship off , roared their joy over the happy end of their work . It was a scene never to be forgotten , for the northern light still shone as brilliantly bright and clear as when the plane left . On the white mountains the air was so crystal clear every crevice could be seen in the peaks of ice miles away . Hardly a cloud was in the sky , which was a beautiful pale blue . The snow and the ships resting on the mirrorlike surface of the water or tied to bergs seemed part of a heroic picture . Only ten days ago the Chantier steamed into this northern fairyland , and now Commander Byrd has made the flight which at times seemed impossible . So great is every one 's happiness that every American in the place is greeted with outstretched hands in congratulation . Tonight will be a gala night on the Chantier . And high up on the white hillside , silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fokker rests like a tired bird , its wings outstretched heading south , her brave journey ended .
