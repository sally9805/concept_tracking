SOMETHING ought to be done about the local folklore , and the Manhattan rituals . Look at the size of our buildings , the majesty of our bridges ; and then look at the pizzling little Ceremonials that cake place when buildings and bridges and streets are inaugurated or torn asunder . When they opened Eighth Avenue , somebody snipped a piece of string . When they started to wreck the Waldorf , they let Governor Smith make a feeble pass at one of the bricks . When the Hudson River Bridge was strung across the river , some well-manicured folks who had n't seen Washington Heights in twenty years gat together and shook hands . Such ceremonials are wishy-washy ; nobody has any fun ; the papers do n't even get any new pictures . ? ; There is our civic imagination ? Any public wrecking of the Waldorf should have been done by Oscar , with a big firecracker . Eighth Avenue should have been opened under cover of darkness , with the less said the better . As for the Hudson River Bridge , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving out the Governor of New Jersey , and many of them including Ed Wynn in a rowboat . THE neatest trick of last week was executed by Grover Whalen . When he met Prime Minister MacDonald down the bay , he had on a black vest ; when he introduced him a short time later at City Hall , he had on a white vest . Tie had n't been home inthe meantime . He had been with Mr. MacDonald all the while . Quite aside from the impression which this must have made on the Prime Minister ( and , through him , on the British Empire ) , consider the stir that it must have caused among the ringleaders of New York 's underworld , who are watching Whalen 's every move ! It must have set them thinking . A police commissioner who is sly enough to change vests right under the nose of a British premier will have to be watched pretty sharply by criminals and nefarious characters of all sorts . They better think twice before they commit any more crimes . COMMISSIONER WHALEN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week  --  yes , of the whole month  --  was that of Congress in getting so excited over propaganda . Anyone who tries to find out the facts about anything knows that in New York alone enough propaganda is turned out every day to sink the navy . It 's one of the city 's biggest industries . Once the press agent slapped backs and told jokes , Now the racket is full of highfalutin titles and has no sense of humor . We have propaganda for skyscrapers , millinery , power trusts , Christian Science , little business , big business ; for separate major divisions of the human race , and for peanuts , popcorn , and chewing-gum . Life is just one continuous session of tariff lobbyists . Now we are in for propaganda against propaganda , and you ca n't tell where it will end . THE check system used by hat- cleaners , Kodak stores , shoe-repair shops , and such places , strikes us as not only tiresome , but unconstitutional . By making a client the custodian of a piece of cardboard without which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the store forces the customer to become , in effect , a part of its organization , a sort of Grade C filing clerk . This circumscribing a person 's right to his own property is undoubtedly a violation of the Bill of Rights . A man can become so loaded down with checks of this nature  --  throwing away many of his own personal papers to make room for them  --  that it affects his whole nervous system . Yet , under the present tyranny , if he ca n't produce his check he is rebuked , even berated . He has failed to Coiiperate in Service . If the store could , it would discharge him from its staff  --  of which he is , however , thank God , a member in check only . Soon the degrading injustice of this scheme will dawn on the masses  --  you know what the masses are  --  and cause riots . Being merely a commentator we shall not join in , but we shall be on the outskirts doing a little sly inciting . A STRANGER in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not hot . He might see that apples are in the carts and that OCTOBER 12 , 19 Z 9 kids are playing football . But without his flaming hillsides he might miss October 's intimations . People who dwell in town do n't . They can smell the fall right through the gas from cars . They can see it in shop windows and hear it in the subway . Down in the Village the people whose houses look out on the garden between Sullivan and McDougal have seen autumn in the visitation of the brown thrasher and the veery . One drifting yellow leaf on a windowsill can be a city dweller 's fall , pungent and melancholy as any hillside in New England . Reading Season ABryant Park empties , attendance at the library increases . It 's hard to get hold of a file of a newspaper now . Not only are they heavily in demand by the recent bench-sitters , but also by a multitude of writers , successful and unsuccessful , going over the crime stories from everywhere and getting facts and inspiration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on  --  if you ca n't read . On the first floor is a lot of rare Dickensi ana  --  the manuscript of " A Christmas Carol , " a lock of the author 's hair , some of his works in Esperanto , Lithuanian , and even shorthand . Ellen Terry 's midget set of Shakespeare 's comedies is also on display ; books so tiny you could hold the whole set in one hand if they would let you . The library is also proudly showing off one of the dullest honks in the world , a set of the statutes of England printed a hundred and fifty years ago . As dry and boring as a book can be , it is rare and costly because of a strange history . A limited edition was printed by the Crown and offered to a selected list  --  or what would be known to the trade today as a sucker list . In this case the suckers were British peers . The weighty volumes were gloriously bound in full leather with gold edges and a studded clasp . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the bindings for lighter reading matter , and thus a copy of that edition of the laws of the realm became hard to find . ( This may have been where the late Houdini got his idea of trying to make a certain book rare by buying up all the copies he could find and destroying all but six or seven . The book dealt with the life of John Wilkes Booth ; it is n't yet quoted very high . ) The library  --  to get hack  --  probably answers more questions than any other place in town  --  even including the Grand Central information desk , which , oddly enough , the library helps out . The commonest question asked in the building has to do with trains . Out-of-towners get into the library by mistake , thinking it is the Grand Central . When a man wrote in recently asking for a definition of love , the library did not simply refer him to the Standard Dictionary  --  it sent him a photostat of the definition from that book .

Requests for help on anagrams and crossword puzzles are among the few that are ignored  --  too numerous . Among inquiries which the library got this year , and answered , were : " How does one make peanut-oil ? " and " Can you give me the address of a manufacturer of bottle-making machinery ? " SI Raid at the DAVY CROCKETT Club an old linitation.Wood-cut by John Heldjr its Ike old AAA THE NEW YORKER 19 At one time hundreds of letters came in asking for a certain kind of medicine , and often containing money orders . It developed that the manufacturers of this medicine had been using a photograph of the library in their ads , to lend tone . The picture was not labelled but the American people recognized it and , quick to put two and two together and get six , they figured the library was making the medicine . This business finally died out . Dearie for Short YOUR florist , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the problem of pets in town . Those difficulties presented by the possession of a cat , a dog , fish , white mice , alligators , and so on , are done away with by the Darlingtonia , which is a sort of combination of them all , with dashes of orchid and old-fashioned fly paper added . It ca n't curl up on the sofa and go to sleep but it 's pretty lively just the same , especially for a plant . It 's a plant , a carnivorous plant . It has a long , hollow stalk , widening at the top , with a prettily mottled hood , like a cobra , in which is a mouth . Instead of leaves it has whiskers  --  beautiful red and green whiskers that have a peculiar fascination for flies and other insects . It lives on these insects . They inno-cently alight on the whiskers and are swallowed . Of course , if you have no flies or other flying bugs around the apartment you must feed it something else .

Dormouse OUR talk of clipping bureaus encouraged a correspondent to forward an excerpt from an article written about ten years ago by the head of one of the large clipping agencies , in which he told of the strangest event of his career . One day a man came to his office and placed an order for all newspaper items based on the following subject : the finding by any guest in a hotel anywhere of a mouse swimming in a pot of tea . Something in the man 's manner  --  probably grimness ? forbade questioning and the request was placed on file . The bureau 's readers kept it in mind for several years ness of the machine .

The Big Drum A GENTLEMAN who met Wil-ti 7 A x Liam B. Shearer ( pron. " share , " i not " shear " has seen him many m several years ago and times since says that he is undoubtedly i 45 .. sincere in his advocacy of a big navy , somewhat fanatical on the subject . On the ship he talked of nothing else  --  seldom does talk of anything else . He often harangues people who do n't care much one way or another . He likes to thunder , enjoys an argument or a rumpus , is loud in his admirations and hatreds , but never hitter . He is more than six feet tall , big , and wears tweeds , which make him look even bigger . People often tell him that he resembles Wallace Beery , the movie villain , and this does not displease him . He is past fifty but looks forty  --  in some of his photographs even younger . He recently picked as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe . On the ship he exercised enormously . He played shuffleboard with the captain , laughed heartily if he won , laughed heartily if he lost ; got up a bridge game every now and then but did n't play himself . He spent much time in his stateroom going over piles of papers which he carried in briefcases . He has many briefcases and likes to be photographed carrying one . Usually his wife and daughter , who is in her twenties , travel with him . The daughter calls her mother Margaret and her father Will . Shearer has owned a theatre in London and a gold mine in Colorado , has acted , and built engineering plants , but of recent years he has thought only of ships and navies , upon which he has collected as many facts as most anybody in the world . Chiaroscuro NE of our Long Island corre-ON spondents reports a curious happening at the annual conference of the Episcopal Church , Diocese of Long Island , which was held at East Hampton . At one of the sessions a heated controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Reverend Mr. Blackshear , who has been discouraging the attendance of negroes at his church . An open split was threatened for a while , but after many words had been hurled peace was finally restored through the tact of the presiding bishop and the good nature of four colored clergymen who were present . One of the latter , however , quite innocently came very near starting the row all over again . Cigars had been suggested and he went from the auditorium to the tobacco counter of the hotel in which the meeting was held and bought a box of them . Returning , he passed it around . There was a deep , anxious hush when he offered it to the Reverend 11.1r . Blackshear . The brand of cigar he had bought was Black and White . Cheek Turners IT 'S not so easy being a conductor I on a Fifth Avenue bus as you might think . Before candidates land their jobs , they submit to a seven-day training period  --  w h i c h consists largely of insults . " Get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts . To which the rookie must make a soft answer . Many of them become so enrag ed during this training period that they are immediately disqualified . Even those who pass are kept on probation sixty days . The rule of the Company is that the customer is always right , which is pretty hard for some youngIrishmen to swallow . " You squashed my nice new cherry pie , you big idiot ! " cries the mythical passenger . " Ah , madam , this is most unfortunate , " the candidate is supposed to answer . " Whaddya mean , asking for a second fare from me ? " " I am very sorry , " replies the rookie . " I did not recall that I had asked you before . I apologize . " Besides learning to eat dirt , the conductors must learn haw to handle drunks  --  which the Company prescribes must be done with the utmost courtesy . In general they are to he treated " like elderly people . " An inebriate may sleep as much as he chooses on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers . If he should act up , the conductor is supposed to remove him ceremoniously and put him , if possible , into a cab . One of the things the trainer does is to tell the new man to open a window . A minute later he tells him to close it . Sometimes he does this ten times . Passengers actually are like that . If one passenger wants a window open and another wants it closed , the conductor is expected to seek out a third opinion : the matter has to be arbitrated . No back talk . Women whom the conductor keeps from getting off until the bus stops , so as to save their lives , sometimes slap him across the face with their gloves . The conductor is not supposed to slap back . Most of the employees are Irish . Most of them are married men with families . They keep their jobs . They call themselves Faccoites ( figure it out , it 's like Nabisco ) . They have a little publication of their own , for which their daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

After twenty years with the Company , a man gets a diamond emblem . We do n't know what he does with it , but he gets it . Heavies ALITTLE shopgirl with dreamy eyes , whose morning and evening way lies across the Plaza at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street , had built up for herself a little myth about the glorious people who must live in those spaciously windowed corner rooms of the Savoy-Plaza . Came , alas , disillusion the other twilight . On her way to her boarding house she looked up as usual to gather sustenance for her soul , and beheld in one of the windows of the fifth-floor old-fashioned flannel union up to dry . Handicapper THE elderly ( the adjective will dis- please him ) gentleman , slight but sprightly , whom you may have noticed at one or another of the race tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paddock , is Walter S. Vosburgh . He probably knows as much about horses as anyone else in America . Mr. Vosburgh , who is past seventy , is official handicapper for The Jockey Club , the organization that runs all the tracks in the state . That is a very special position and highly important . For the uninitiated it might be said that the handicapper is the man who assigns weights to horses . A horse is given a certain weight to carry before every race in which he is scheduled to run . His weight may vary during the season , depending on his performances . The idea is to equalize , as far as possible , the winning chances of the various horses . THE NEW YORKER If , with jockey and trappings , a horse still does n't carry the weight that Vosburgh has decreed for the animal , lead slugs are added . It might seem odd to the layman that responsibility for such an important decision should ' rest in one man and not in a solemn board of handicappers ? but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jockeys , bettors everyone has faith in Vosburgh . They never question his method of assigning weights  --  nor would it do them any good if they did . He will discuss his handicaps with no one and has never revealed on what basis he works in assigning them . The job is pretty much routine with him now , for he has handicapped more than two hundred thousand horses in his day a day that began way back in the last century . His biggest year was 1903 , when he handicapped ninety-two hundred . He has kept written record of every horse he ever handicapped  --  weight , date , and all , and this voluminous documentation runs into several dozen hefty volumes . To go with that , he has the largest collection of photographs of horses in the country . More than twenty thousand . Agents send him new pictures every year from all over the world . They say Vosburgh can tell more about a horse from a snapshot than many an expert can from looking at it in the flesh . He especially prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there for the racing , but to go has always been his dream . As for America , he has seen every great thoroughbred in action here for the past sixty years . When he was a youngster , he saw Ruthless win the first Belmont Stakes in 1867 at Jerome Park . He thinks the greatest horses he ever saw , out of all the thousands , were Henry of Navarre , Sysonhy , and Man o ' War . Out of season he collects butterflies , breeds prize chickens , and accommodates people who want difficult questions answered about races long ago and far away . His memory is remarkable . He can name the winners of the Derby and the St. Leger Stakes in order for the past hundred years  --  and other things like that , He does n't believe in betting on horses and insists it never pays in the lung run . The last wager he placed was forty years ago . His horse lost . He lives in New Rochelle , but for more than sixty years he lived in the same house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Concourse now . in his youth it was a remote Tidy Profit THERE is a town in Canada noted for its synip , and two young ladies returning from there decided to bring back two jugs of it as presents for friends in New York . Motoring , they crossed the border at Rouses Point . The inspector , after poking through their baggage , sniffed at the jugs , grinned , and waved them on . This , the girls noticed , brought forth stares of amazement from two young men in a roadster directly behind them . Further along the girls stopped at a roadside restaurant for lunch . The meal was rudely broken off when they looked out of the window to see the two fellows in the roadster drive up to their car , grab one of the jugs , and whirl away . They rushed out and found on the driver 's seat a ten-dollar bill and a note which said , in effect , that two men could get snore fun out of a jug of whiskey than two girls could and that anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were off in their percentage . The syrup had cost only a dollar a jug .
