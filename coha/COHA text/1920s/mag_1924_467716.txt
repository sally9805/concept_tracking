TO that ancient trilogy of mysteries unsolvable ? the way of the serpent on the sand , the way of the bird in the air , and the way of a man with a. maid ? I would add a fourth : the mystery of the trailing hound . Perhaps there is no common phenomenon which is less understood and less appreciated than this . A good dog of any kind will perform a miracle of trailing before our eyes , yet we remain unimpressed . Probably our apparent disinterest is less a matter of sluggish observation than it is a lazy acceptance of something really very wonderful . For the thing is marvelous ; and 1 a study of it can not fail to elevate our consideration for the whole canine race . . The place is a wild sea beach . The situation is a lonely uninhabited island , miles off the Carolina coast . The time is just after sunset , - and the evening glow is suffusing with a warm and rosy light the long thickets of sweet myrtle , the towering yellow pines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters in the picture are my hound Trigger and / -- in this business at hand mentioned strictly in the order of their relative importance . From a wood-road that has wound duskily through the semi-tropical forest of the solitary coastal island , we i have suddenly emerged upon the beach . Before us in the sundown rolls the Atlantic . I am just beginning to experience those vague Leavings of heart that one nearly always feels upon encountering the ocean in the sunset , bringing with them longings for lost loves of the long ago and all that , when my romantic reverie is suddenly interrupted by the behavior of my hound . He , too , is thinking , and rather urgently and definitely of a lost love ; for he has come upon the trail of a deer . Some time in the late forenoon ? so I judged by a careful examination of the tracks ? a buck had come out of the forest and had paced up the beach . He had walked , as I afterward ascertained , some two miles down the sands , enjoying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage loneliness . The beach sands were dry and powdery and drifting ; they were of the whispering , faintly hissing variety , fine and arid . As the wind moved them among the blades and stems of the beach grasses they made a faint sibilant shrilling . In such Sahara dryness how could a , buck leave a scent , at least such a trail as Trigger could pick up easily ? Yet , such a scent had evidently been left ; or would it be fairer to say that the hound 's nose found what nothing else in the world could discover ? an aroma shed many long hours before ? . . Human noses appear to be chiefly decorative , and sometimes dubious in that capacity , both as to shape and to color ; and they have so far degenerated as to have lost all power to detect any save the grossest and most flagrant scents . We smell a rose at a distance of a yard , peril:11 ) s , and a petunia bed has our awareness at a greater distance ; a hound 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odor at two hundred yards or more . Man 's nose scents not the hob white at all . A good setter or pointer , working up a damp breeze , will wind the bird across an acre field . But the mere fact of Trigger 's picking up the trail was not what most interested me , since that T accounted for simply by giving his nose its due . But how was he able , I wondered , to know which way the buck had gone ? Why did he not run the back track ? To put the larger question , How does any dog , following any trail , know which direction to take ? Here on this dry sea beach , with a trail a halfday old , perhaps Trigger was to answer the question for me . I say " perhaps , " for this problem is one which has never been definitely solved . I hope to be able to establish certain presumptions in favor of certain views . Apparently , to take up the trail , the hound made no use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trailing hound would make use of his eyes to guide him . At such a time , the hound 's eyes have in them a liquid wild luminance , bright and undetermined , by no means concentrated to close observa tion , and seeming to express in eerie light the awakening of clairvoyant powers in other senses . Probably , both the sense of sight and the sense of hearing come occasionally into use . Not infrequently I have observed a trailing hound pause to listen , especially in a thicket , in the hope that some noise made by the quarry might direct him . Sometimes the hound is thus guided . He often rejoins the pack through giving a momentary ear to its wild music . But the sense of sight can not , in the nature of the case , often be brought into play . A trailing hound is not frequently afforded a chance to see clearly the contour of the tracks that he is following ; therefore , he can rarely rely THE SORCERY OF THE TRAILING HOUND 3e7 on the sense of sight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying eyes on the game . But when he does that , the matter of trailing , in the strict sense , is over . In woods , in powdery sands , over dry hard ground , tracks will either he invisible or distinguishable as mere scratches and holes . A hound never , like a wilderness hunter , rakes aside the leaves and the pinestraw to discover the imprints of a wild fugitive . That a dog depends much on sight is highly improbable ; that he occasionally is assisted by it is possible ? especially if lie be a wise old hound . The sagacity of such a creature would hardly permit it to leave unemployed a salient sense . But when we consider with what readiness and avidity a hound will run a trail in the dark , or when no tracks are apparent , we understand that the sense of smell is the master agent in this performance . I . remember with what . deep interest I watched one night an old hound unravel , in the glimmering sands of a moonlit glade in the pinelands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by moonlight in the Southern woods in midwinter used to he a favorite sport of mine ; and it taught me something of the behavior of hounds trailing at night . I was afoot ; and , in trying to keep ahead of the fox in the general direction of my hound 's advance , I was afforded a close and interesting view of the wary fugitive . Into the faerie glade he stole silently , looking very small and tired ; seeming also excessively bored . Because uncertainty hardly by design ? he proceeded to make what hunters call a " trail puzzle . " He ran here and there , pausing , listening , peering into the silent woodlands that ringed the glade . Of course , the trail that he left was a very crisscrossed affair . After he was gone , my hound named Weser came up . She immediately detected my presence ; but evidently as game I was insignificant . The tracks of the fox were discernible in the sand ; but the hound could not possibly have followed them by distinguishing the direction they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed . For perhaps five minutes Weser wound her way through the mazy trail ; at length , with a triumphant yowl , she announced that the mystery had yielded to her patient art . In this **26;611;TOOLONG age of ours we know that pet dogs seldom have a chance to see a human track . Yet they trail their owners . If I were to hazard a venture as to which dog probably placed habitually some dependence upon sight to guide him over certain places in a trail , I should say the bloodhound . At least , men who have trained blbodhounds to do their eerie work have told me that these great dogs ( mild and gentle by disposition ) can be taught the direction that a fugitive has taken by the direction in which ' his tracks point . But after all , if any trailer had naught but his sight to guide him , he would not trail far . The greyhound , for all his agility and fleetness , for all the wild vigor of his sight and hearing , is practically worthless on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obscure pursuit is not in seeing the track but in snuffing up the scent . Yet , with all his ability as a ' loser , how can the hound tell , merely by this single sense , which direction to take ? One leads to the trail 's cold and empty end ; the other leads to the quarry . Seldom , indeed , will even the most poorly equipped hound take the wrong direction . And , apparently , the hound has but this one sense to guide him . But I have heard old woodsmen declare that a hound on a very hot track gets more than scent : he actually gets a delicious taste as well . I am not prepared to say that lie does ; but often , while working out a " hot corner " into which a stag or a fox has been pressed , I have watched unwearied dogs working greedily with their mouths open . close to the ground , as if they were satisfying , in some degree , the keen sense of taste . Occasionally a hard-pressed quarry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these the following hounds will mouth up eagerly . I am not sure that the hound employs the sense of taste in trailing ; but I am inclined to believe that there is something of truth suggested by the old woodland expression , " That hound 's tasting the trail . " I may add that trailing hounds almost always work with their mouths open , whereas hounds running by sight often close theirs . It is possible that , upon . viewing the quarry , the sense of sight is called upon to do what taste and smell had been doing . Yet even with the two powerful senses of taste and smell at work , the trailing hound does a wonderful thing in heading in the right direction . My hound Trigger , on the lone sea beach , took the right direction , and with but the faintest hesitation . He turned southward . I saw that the tracks of the buck were indeed headed that way . I caught the dog , led him northward along the beach , turned him about seven or eight times so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him on the trail again , being careful to point him in the wrong direction . He snuffed knowingly to the right , to the left , gave me a look of rebuke as if he were asking what kind of silly game I were trying to play , turned southward , and settled down to the slot . Despite my attempt to fool him , or at least to Lest him , he was not in the least uncertain . Several explanations can be offered for Trigger 's mastery of the situation ; and these will , of course , apply to any other hound . The first is that he has a nose of such keenness that he could scent mercenary motives in a missionary to Molokai ; that his powers of smelling are adjusted to a nicety so exquisite that he is able , even on an old trail in dry sand , to determine which end of a trail is going to " pick up , " and which one has in it the element of fading away ; that he has certain guides which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there exists in the trailing hound an abiding element of mystery . Often , indeed , good dogs will make a temporary false start down the wrong end of a trail ; but they are usually swift to correct their error , and they do it in that shamefaced way that seems to prove that they consider it the most gauche and amateurish of faults . To illustrate this point I may say that early one morning it was my good fortune , on the dewy borders of a great tupelo swamp not far from home , to walk up three full-antlered stags . They had been lying together under a fragrant canopy of dwarf pines ; when started , they rocked lithely away at right angles , crossing the misty open woods . My two dogs were in the bush-hung pathway behind me , and they had not seen the deer . Quietly , I took them off into the woods and brought them abruptly on the steaming trail . It was so hot that , they yelped joyously in unison and tore down the back track . The younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus raced ; then the older dog overtook the younger , snarled and snapped at it viciously , whirled , and came tearing back . The two made the turn simultaneously ; and it appeared to me that the old dog had administered a rebuke to the impetuous youngster for playing so silly a trick . Nor is it unusual for a trained dog to admonish and to punish a misbehaving youngster . Many times in the woods I have watched hounds hesitate on trails , run back and forth a little , take small circles ; but always at last the puzzle would be solved . Of course , there naturally conies a time when . the last vestige of scent vanishes . ( or evaporates , or makes its own peculiar escape ) ; how long before this occurs will depend on the strength and the quality of the original scent , and those atmospheric conditions such as stillness and dampness which are favorable to the long retention of odors . It is said that a good bloodhound will follow a human trail that is twenty hours old ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and to take notice of one older than that . But the hours intervening had been windless damp ones . Dampness holds scent ; but rain will wash it away . When the sun is hot and the wind is blowing , when the earth is exposed and dry , any scent , however heavy , will be soon dissipated ? or at least with relative quickness . I have seen hounds completely lose a trail while crossing a dry ridge and pick it up again in a cool damp hollow beyond . We have seen the hound Trigger taking the right end of a trail on a bare beach . In the woods his method is somewhat different . And the difference so observed may assist us in understanding this mystery of the trailing hound . If my observations are correct , it is easier for a dog to follow with certainty a trail through the woods than it is along hare ground . The reasons for this presumed truth are interesting , and have never , I think , been discussed . Iii wildwoods a good hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless literally on the tail of the quarry , smelling grass , bushes , low-sweeping limbs . Of course , he gets scent of the game from these ? possibly a sort of general aroma that the wild creature has left in brushing by ; certainly , in the case of deer , the powerful and permeating odor , faintly sweet ( and in the deer noticeable to human beings ) from the great scent-glands behind the knees on the back legs . While it is difficult to make anestimate such as the following , it is probable that these glands utter a more heavy and arresting scent than do the glands between the hoofs . The scent deposited by the deer 's knee-glands is usually left just at the height to which a dog stands ; a lid that fact accounts for a hound 's traveling high through brushy undergrowth . A close observer in the woods , before he looks for tracks , can generally tell whether a hound is following a fox or a deer ; a fox , wild turkey , rabbit , raccoon , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deer that has walked through brush will incline his pursuer to lift his head . True , Reynard , in traveling fast , will do much jumping over and through bushes ? " high-sidling " as it is sometimes called ; but in an ordinary chase , when stealing along craftily , he prefers to skulk under and around bushes . Of course , the same thing is true of a deer that is , unless in wild flight , he will dodge and skulk . I have often seen deer moving about naturally , or but slightly startled , deliberately choose to squeeze under a barbed wire fence rather than jump over it , and stoop and almost crawl to get under a leaning tree that could have been much more easily leaped . Yet the height at which a deer stands determines that much of the scent he leaves shall be deposited higher than that left by smaller game . . Much of the foregoing information may appear obvious ; its restatement , however , seems necessary to a careful examination of a hound 's pursuit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell in which direction his quarry has gone ? It seems not unlikely that a buck , let us say , brushing through a clump of myrtles or bays , passing from south to north , will leave more scent on the south side and on those leaves turned that way than he can on the sides of the leaves which he would not brush in following such a course . Precisely the same thing is true of a deer 's going through grass , either the common low growths or the knee-high sorts like broom sedge . One who has watched the action of a careful hound following a difficult trail through grass will have observed with what intelligent and delicate solicitude the sagacious trailer has paused to sniff up and down the stems and leaves , giving special attention to both sides of the blades . It is not at alI unlikely that such a dog 's amazing power of scent is capable of detecting against which side of the grass-blades and stems a deer has been consistently brushing , and of being thereby enabled to determine the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hound to carry a cold trail properly is not the most remarkable feature of his ability : he possesses the artistry of high discriminative powers . Of course , as of men , so of dogs : there are kinds and kinds . There are some dogs , even some hounds , that have no virtues in the woods ; and at home they seem little more than hearty appetites . But the trained hound can be taught to run a fox and nothing else , or a deer , or a raccoon . Yet in woods wild enough for one of these creatures to be found , it is likely that many will be present . The trained dog will enter a dewy maze of cover , reject allurements in the way of scents as tempting as sin , and by nothing will he turned aside from his urgent business of finding the proper quarry . Despite his powers of discrimination , the hound commonly either does not distinguish between the deer and the wild turkey or else he considers the two equally im-portant . Every deerhound I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be very fresh . The scent given off by a wild turkey is quite heavy and penetrating ; but inasmuch as it is not produced by regular glands , as is the deer 's , it is the more readily dissipated . It is somewhat amusing to watch a good hound reach the place in the trail of a turkey which marks the great bird 's taking flight . There is , of course , no more trail ; and possibly a few rare hounds know what this sudden end means . But the average trailer will he painfully , irreconcilably baffled . It seems to the dog what witchcraft or necromancy seems to man . As the hound takes the turkey-trail , so the bird-dog will occasionally follow a deer-trail . Naturally , he follows the turkey , finding in it the amazing climax of all his trained ambitions . The behavior of a setter or a pointer after a deer is usually something of a burlesque . I have seen a bird-dog run after a deer and bark violently at it , thinking it , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been created for their occasional diversion . There are a few instances on record of bird-dogs which have been trained to follow and to point deer . With a dOg thus broken I have had no experience ; but it is evident that the thing is possible . Indeed , with the truly sensible and intelligent dog , what education , and what effect from it are not possible ? Mention has been made of the fact that the deer has distinct glands for secreting and giving off scent , whereas many other wild creatures ( especially the birds ) have apparently but a general aroma which identifies them . The reason for this difference is possibly simple : birds usually find one another by calling . Deer find one another by following the scent ? which is , after all , but a silent language , a tacit message which becomes a menace to the creature leaving it whenever the enemy picks it up . Deer regularly follow one another by scent ; occasionally they will bleat . But by nature they are singularly silent , self-effacing creatures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my vision was that of a buck , in the mating season , following at full speed the trail of a doe . He was running with his read low ; and after he had passed , an examination of the trail showed me that the doe had passed not long before . When the good hound enters deer-country , it is not to be thought that he unravels the mystery set before him without distinct effort ? of a sort which appears to have something mental in it . He may have clear sailing ; but the chances are that he will encounter complications . And our respect for his ability will be heightened if we briefly consider some of the difficulties which may assail lam . Let us say that he is fairly started on a stag 's track ; a possible complication may be met if the hound 's buck crosses another deer 's trail . In short , the dog is thereby afforded an excellent opportunity for mislaying the original find . Some owners of hounds do not make much of such a mistake ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the trailer is lured away from the first track . How difficult it may be to hold this trail is appreciated if one considers that the second track may be much fresher than the first ; in such a ease the hound is not only called upon to discriminate between the two , but to follow the less inviting one . Is not this something like an actual test of moral character ? I have known old hounds which could staidly tread this safe and narrow path ; and I have known many that would leave it , especially if a pack were working . A tried hound , trailing slowly arid alone , with no pace set by a pack and no mob-psychology thereof to trouble him , will hold the original scent . If the conflicting slots are of the same relative strength , does not his constancy establish the curious fact that he can distinguish between individual deer ? If each animal has its own individuality and its accompanying aura , the hound 's task is not so difficult as might appear . A common dog can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , should not a hound , with his patrician nose , be capable of following his particular deer ? That each animal should have its own peculiar aura seems the more likely when we consider that thus members of a family could follow one another with certainty , as they do . And therefore I believe the good hound , at the intersection of trails , says to himself : " Here 's a. stranger that has just passed ; but I must hold to my own deer " ? or words to that effect . Another complication which the hound must meet is the " patchy " trail . The deer may pass over a piece of burned ground , or earth that is very hard and dry . He may and probably he is very designedly fond of ? doing this wade some distance through water . Upon taking a notion to be startled , he may make a few little leaps of twenty or twenty-five feet ( I know of one carefully measured jump of a few inches over thirty-two feet ) . The deer may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a . ? " the fresh scent beyond . If not , he usually begins to circle , and one of his arcs will soon cross the deer 's line of travel . If the difficulty is with running water , the hound can not depend on any scent that he will pick up in that . But from very careful observation of hounds and of their behavior in taking a trail through still water ( such as a small pond , a lagoon , or a bayou ) I am persuaded to believe that they may get a certain degree of scent from this element . If dampness retains scent , as it assuredly does , why should not still water ? And as the tendency of all these classes of odors is to be dissipated by rising and by evaporation , it is reasonable to conjecture that the surface of the quiet water might give oft some odor from the deer that the bound is following . However , I do not believe that water , if it holds scent at all , will hold it long . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished by time same virtues . One will have a phenomenally cold nose ; one will always tell the truth ; one will have the ability to follow im-placably a single trail ; one will be gifted to unravel the snarls in a tangled skein of scent ; another will have the bottom to run all clay . With such qualities in the pack , both the hunter and the quarry are sure to have an interesting time of it . And not the least pleasure to the sports-man is the study to distinguish the gifts of the different dogs , and the watching with what fidelity to his particular virtue each hound will conduct himself . Soda , per-chance , will find the trail ; Whisky will fol-low it longest ; Nip and Tuck will cover the breaks ; Check and Mate will take care of all doubling ; Hammer will snap at a puppy because he wants to run a fox , and will otherwise give the youngster a training in manners ; Trigger will disdain a hot-ter scent than the one which the pack is working . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it elements of the whimsical , but always the deeper ele-ment of mystery ; for after all the expla-nations and conjectures for a hound 's ex-cellence have been made , there remains the exciting possibility of something just a little beyond our immediate ken . And this we might as well call sorcery .
