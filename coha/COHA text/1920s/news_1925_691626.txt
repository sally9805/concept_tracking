txt Through the suit But the " Case " of a " publicity Is Not man " to collect . eal R Less money claimed as the due from ' the Board of Commissioners in ? Dayton , Tenn. , . it would seem that the indictment of Professor SCOPES for teaching evolution was the result less of a stern determination to protect the Book of Genesis than for the purpose of advertising the little town and " putting it on the map . " The officials in question seemingly thought that to have a teacher tried there on such a charge would produce no end of talk all over the country and bring a lot of money into the place , and , not discriminating between notoriety and fame , they raised a fund for incidental expenses . After paying the publicity man $150 for his bright idea , they decided that they could work the scheme without further help from ' him . Whether he has a grievance against them remains to be proved in court , unless a compromise is effected , but all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is known that the Scopes indictment , in Dayton 's hurry to get ahead of other eater Tennessee towns , was found so irregularly that it can be quashed , but another is to be drawn . Professor SCOPES is not charged by anybody with having had any part in bringing about the sensation from which Dayton expects to profit so much , but it has been known from the beginning that his arrest was brought about by a friend of his and a good evolutionist , simply that the law might be tested . At any rate the publicity end of the affair has not been connected with either of them as yet , and Professor Scopes , while in this city , recently , carried himself in a way to make it next to Incredible that he intentionally would lend himself to a scheme so foolish .

This interesting question has presented itself over in the Arlington section of Brooklyn . There two doctors who have specialized in the therapeutic use of X and ultra-violet rays are continuing to ' carry on their presumably more or less beneficent , work , but in the course of ' it their machines are sending qut etheriall waves that so interfere with the recep tion uf musical and'other programs from the several sending stations that the people in a wide area around the office of these doctors get nothing except howls and squawks . This is only one of several instances of erolible produced in the same or a like manner . The little town of Mystic , Conn. , suffers from the activities of another violet-ray specialist , and in Massachusetts it was discovered , not long ago , that the long leather belt that ran from the engine in a factory to its machinery was giving out electric sparks to such a degree that radio reception was impossible , or at any rate utterly unsatisfactory , for several miles around .

With the lawn as they are no compulsion , apparently , can be used , but a time will come when the conditions required for good radio reception will be granted as a right , not as a privilege . The operators of the sending stations already have realized that it is necessary for them to submit to Government control in the use of wave lengths , Power and the like . Later , it will have to be made a misdemeanor to put stray , uncovenanted electrical currents " on the air , " for radio is coming to have enormous importance to multitudes of people in matters of business as well as of pleasure . A new obstacle to Enforcement the enforcement of Made prohibition is reDifficult. ported from Easton . Pa . The State Police have made many ' arrests of liquor dealers and transporters , but the juries evidently are of a wet turn of mind and acquit the accused in many cases . Then the costs are imposed on the trooper who made the arrest ! Naturally this is a burden which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy to imagine what effect it has on their zeal in enforcing the law . It is hard to avoid the suspicion that said effect is exactly what those who produce it intend to bring about . When the troopers protest against what amounts to fining them for making arrests in liquor cases they are told that they should not make such arrests until after they have consulted the District Attorney That is much the same thing as telling them to let the bootleggers alone . It is not asserted that the troopers are reckless , and as yet they have not been prosecuted for false arrest , even in the instances when the jurors were most prompt In acquitting the accused , but probably that will be the next step . More information An Invention than was contained Still fn a Detroit disMysterious , patch printed yesterday will be required for understanding the operations of a new airplane now under test there . It is one from which great things are Premised in the way of vertical ascent as well as in other respects wherein the airplane now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be that it has " self-feathering paddle-wheel propellers . " The use of " feathering " oars in rowing a boat is obvious , and the same word was applied in the days of paddlewheel steamboats to a device which kept the floats of the wheels in a vertical position while in the water , so that they would push it back all the time , instead of driving it downward or upward for ' part of that time . A propeller , however , works on a principle entirely different , and " feathering " of either of these sorts would seem to ? be useless for it . The birds all do " feather " their wings constantly in flight  --  change the angle at which the wings strike the air , that is  --  but birds use oars , not propellers , and , anyway . the resemblance of an airplane to a bird is very remote , except in the one respect that both navigate the air .                  @ @ @
