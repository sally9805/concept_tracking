txt AT last I 'm a man of letters , whatever that means . I 've been asked to say things with a pencil , which ' naturally means I should have something to say . Most of the American theatrical managers have spread the report that I 've had altogether too much to say . However , that 's neither here nor there . The fact remains that I have been engaged to tell the truth . So from now on I 'm going to be the champion tattle tale of the world . This new job of mine came out of a clear sky  --  that is , if there is such a thing as a clear sky in Chicago . The message read , " Will you ? " The answer was , " I will , " and newspaper history was made . If at any future tine the newspaper men of Anterica decide to hold a convention in one of the comical convention cities , I will be ? eligible to pin a red badge on the lapel of my jacket and hobnob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " upstaging " me for years . Because I am now a man of letters . Yes , sir  --  a man of letters ant I. Three cheers for the newspaper world . Hurrah for me , too . At last we 're together , as close as two Scotchmen This first letter of mine will be more or less of a simple acceptance of my new assignment . I want all my brother journalists to feel that I appreciate the great honor of being made a regular member of the order . I shall do everything within my power to uphold the dignity of our profession , and promise faithfully that all my stuff shall be not only clean and wholesome but also extremely humorous . OF course , I 'm not going in for any " wise cracking " ? records , nor am I going to attempt to wrest any laurels from either George Ade or Ring Lardner . Mind you , I 'm not saying a word against these two competitors of mine ( I hope they heard me say that ) ; as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laving a style and being stylish are two altogether different propositions . See that ! I 'm beginning to get comical already . You'A just die laughing at some of the things I 'll say . I hat : rather an idea that this letter writing business was goin , - to be a bit of a task , but I 'm surprising even Myself wi , ! 1 the easiness of it all , and the clever way in which PIA handling the thing . Parisi me just a moment till I take another peek at myself in In mirror . As I said before , this first letter of mine is more or less of an introduction , so do n't start passing judgment on me until Pve had a chance to deal with vital subjects and important events . Just think of the wealth of material confronting me ! The new theatrical season . The Firpo-Wills fight . The World 's Series ball game 'S . And the Presidential election . Rock bottom information , too . intimately : the two Shuberts ; the one and only Erlanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Davis ; Bob La Follette and Cal Coolidge , are all personal friends of mine . Not ordinary hand shaking friends , mind you , but the real old " Hello Kid ! How 's every little thing ? " sort of friendship . I know a lot of society people , too ; that is , several of them have been pointed out to me at opening nights . I 'll get closer to them from now on . I 'll sit in the same row . Notice that ! The stuff keeps getting funnier all the time . Pardon me just a moment till I sharpen this pencil of mine . I only wish I 'd been on the job early enough to write the Democratic convention . Whoever wrote it should have made his cuts before it was prOduced . SPEAKING of conventions , we had the little daisy of them all here a few weeks ago . The great Order of Moose . Twelve thousand of them were here . They all stopped at my hotel . Half of them occupied the room next to mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Inly . Thic is Anrnict August is a fool month . Even the songwriters dodge , the issue . It does n't rhyme with any other word . Being in New York this month is like playing center field in the Texas league . Even the dramatic critics are running up and down Broadway all out of breath , trying to swap theater seats for round trip tickets to Long Island . Of course , the theater season is under way , or perhaps I should say under weight . Half of the producers are not producing . One-half will never know how the other half live . The Actors ' Equity association has gone over to the Shuberts . New York city ' is now an island entirely " surrounded by the Shuberts . One thing I want to accomplish with these letters of mine . I want to get in close touch with my readers ? very close touch . Let 's not be strangers any longer . Write me ; wire me ; phone me ! I want my readers to know me better and to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conege my cares to can my attention to a misspelt word or two , I will appreciate it beyond words . I used to dress like a college boy once myself . Of course , in those . days the college boys dressed more than they do now . I ca n't quite describe my get-up , but I daresay it was a cross between an acrobat and a jockey . I was then known as the official flag waver of the American theater . Be sure to have all your friends read these letters of mine . I would also advise you to cut them out and bind the third act , and the best looking bird marries her in the fourth act . I 've never known it to fail . Any one attempting to tell any other story in a successful play has a head on his shoulders that would make an excellent handle . fora walking cane . But there ! Pm talking shop again . I must break myself of that habit . These letters of mine should be of general interest and not confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , as I have stated repeatedly , this first let- , ter of mint must not be taken seriously . It 's merely a greeting . Sort of a " Here I am , glad to meet you " affair . But , from now on , watch out ! I intend to punish . a pencil properly . And again I promise you that these bright and snappy sayings of mine will bring forth one outburst after another . For instance : Can you iinagine all the merry quips pull when I write about the Prince of Wales ? My letter on the prince and his impressions of Great Neck , Long Island , will keep you in , a constant uproar . If the two New York teams win the pennants in their respective leagues , and play the World 's Series , my letter on " How Joe Le Blang , the Cut-Rate King , Got Rid of the Tickets " will also be of unusual interest  --  more interest than the series itself . OW , remember , I invite criticism . Any comment you care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me regarding this or any future letter of mine , I shall be glad to receive , and will give it the same earnest attention I would give Professor Baker of Harvard , if he should attempt to explain to me how to write a play . Most people address me in care of . The Lambs club , to which I do not belong , or to the George M Cohan theater , which does not belong to inc . So kindly send all communications to The Friars ' monastery , 110 West 48th street , New York city , U. S. A. , and if you do n't receive a prompt reply , write again ; and in case it happens the second time you 'll know that my secretary is holding out on me , and that it really is n't my fault after all . . Now , remember , this first letter of mine does n't count . Pm just getting you set for what 's coming . Of course , I 'm speaking directly to my readers , but it takes in the editor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I might just as well have a thorough understanding right now : I expect these letters of mine to be published exactly as they are written  --  objectionable features and all . The policies oj your papers do not concern me in the least ; so my method of attack must not be interfered with in any way . I 'm very fussy about my little letters , and I want my little readers to get full value at all times That 's all for now . You 'll hear from me again next week . Best wishes to all the folks and fondest love to Bertha , or whatever her name happens to be . Yours . GEORGE M.
