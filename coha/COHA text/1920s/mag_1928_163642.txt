Cram &; Ferguson <P> Sirs : <P> Not that it matters , but please , I did n't wear a " little red cap " at the dedication of Princeton Chapel , nor did I have anything to say in " a squeaky little voice " or otherwise , at the opening of the doors , nor did my face or any other portion of my anatomy " thrust itself between them . " <P> Please , also , the Chapel was not designed by me , but by the firm of Cram and Ferguson , a partnership of four individuals of which I am only one member . <P> <P> RALPH ADAMS CRAM <P> Boston , Mass . <P> <P> To Subscriber-Architect Cram , thanks for correction of fact . <P> To the firm of Cram &; Ferguson , all praise for designing a college chapel which excels all other U. S. college chapels in size and , in the judgment of able critics , in beauty. - ED . <P> Valorous Dentists <P> Sirs : <P> When a " clever child " is featured too much by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever or funny , as a rule . It is trying so hard to maintain its reputation for this gift , that sooner or later , it becomes obnoxious and boresome : <P> Just so with TIME . <P> Imagine this silly stuff ( TIME , June 11 , p. 17 , " King " ) : " His Majesty though he may look like a dentist , is valorous at heart . " <P> How do you get that way ? I know more dentists in U. S. than do all the column writers put together . I can mention scores of big game hunters , mountain climbers and real soldiers from the list of any dental society and prove to you that as a class the dental profession is as valorous as any and more than most . <P> I am not going to cancel my subscription , but next time you write such nonsense I shall send to every dentist in the country , photos and fingerprints of TIME 'S staff and then you will get what is coming to you , eventually . <P> <P> NILS JUELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirs : <P> You seem to devote more than a proportionate amount of space to boosting the stock of Eastman Kodak Co. , as witness your several lengthy stories of the phenomenal rise in the business world of George Eastman and his Kodaks ; without , at the same time deigning to give even the briefest possible mention to Ansco , which , I understand , held most of the original patents and processes upon which the present Photographic Industry is based ; nor have you ever , by the very least typographical impress , even so much as given a fact-hungry list of subscribers , newsstandbuyers , Junior Leaguers , et al. , the faintest inkling concerning the merger of Agfa , superpotent Chemical combine , German-owned , with the 86-year old U. S. owned Ansco Photoproducts , Inc. to form Agfa Ansco Corp. ; neither did you give , in your article headed " Vanity Kodaks " on p. 45 , June 4 issue , proper credit to Ansco for pioneering colored cameras three years ago , when Ansco , too , named this product " Vanity Ansco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades for milady 's approval . <P> <P> J. A. TANNENBAUM <P> Scranton , Pa . <P> P. S. Huh ! One sentence with 118 words is n't so unusual-try counting one sentence in the preceding script . J. A. T. <P> <P> Not Slim , Not Lucky <P> Sirs : <P> You ask TIME , June11 why was Lindbergh dubbed " Cheese " ?
