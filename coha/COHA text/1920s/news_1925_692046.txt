txt The anthracite strike was endorsed by the American Federation of Labor at the annual convention here today . John L. Lewis , International President of the ' United Mine Workers of America , in soliciting this support , charged that anthracite mine owners were mulcting the public at an annual rate of sixteen to twenty million dollars by a resizing plan he said they had forced upon retailers . Mr. Lewis also declared that the anthracite consuming public had been lulled into a false sense of security , and was " due for a rude awakening . " He said that if the present suspension were settled tomorrow , production could not catch up with the demand until next Spring . He indicated that hard coal prices would reach $20 a ton , and probably exceed that price for months . He asserted that the public would suffer e , ymplete disappointment in its hope of 7 ' . " gief through use of substitutes . ' : . lie miners ' chief got a cordial recePt , t% from the delegates , who voted unanimously both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution of support and for the resolution itself . The resolution read : " Resolved , That the American Federation of Labor , in convention assembled , extend its full and complete endorsement and sympathy to the 158,000 members of the United Mine Workers of America now engaged In the strike in the anthracite industry . " The A. F. of L. extends to these mine workers its commendation for their great spirit of self-sacrifice and determination in resisting the efforts of the anthracite operators to break down their working conditions and effect wage reductions . " We approve the efforts of the mine workers in their demands for increased wages , improved working conditions and complete recognition of the Union . In the name of the millions of organized workers in America , we approve their policies end extend to them the hand of fellowship and mutual cooperatiqn . " The Executive Council of the A. F. of L. is hereby directed to cooperate in every possible and practical way to the end that the anthracite mine workers achieve complete success In their efforts . " Lewis Charges Extortion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The anthracite operators are extorting from the public a sum which ranges between sixteen million and twenty million dollars annually to which they have no decent claim . When they appeal to the public for support , they come into court with unclean hands . In April of this year they put through a resizing deal with the retailers , which gives the operators a chance to work off their steam sizes on the public by mixing them with the domestic sizes and charging the old prices . The retailers feared that if they protested they would be cut off and given no more coal to sell . The operators stand to make between sixteen and twenty million dollars annually by this deal , to retain the old trade names and lower their quality . The Public is now paying for the old names at the old prices and getting much smaller stuff to burn . " They not only lowered the sizes outright , but introduced the round mesh in place of the square mesh in the breaker screens . This move alone means a re- I duction of one-fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rough edge ' of the producers that takes the greatest possible advantage of every emergency and that was found to be shipping 16 per cent . dirty coal immediately after the 1923 suspension is using this change in standards as an excuse for a wholesale pouring of the smaller sizes into the larger ones in disregard of both old and new classifications . They will doubtless make this change pay them five million dollars annually over and allove the grab shared by all the producers . " The mesh for chestnut and pea sizes has been changed so that between onefourth and 30 per cent . of all the pea coal sold , or 1.437,000 tons at least , is now sold as chestnut . Chestnut has always had an allowance of 15 per cent . of smaller sizes , but this Is something new . The difference in price between the two sizes is $3.15 per ton and stands to pay the operators $4.526,550 for their shrewdness . Sees $9,384,000 Buckwheat Profit . " The mesh for buckwheat No. 1 has been cut so that at least one-third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1024 they sold 9,384,000 gross tons of buckwheat No. 1 . At present prices , buckwheat sells at the mines at $2.50 per gross ton and pea sells at $5.50 . The difference is $3 per ton . The sales of one-third of the total buckwheat production as pea coal will net a profit of $3-a ton on 3,128,000 tons , or $9,284 , - 000 . This is in addition to the 862,000 tons of buckwheat coal that has in the Past years regularly been sold to you as pea coal , " The mesh for stove coal has also been changed by 7 per cent. , so that 1,242,000 tons ' of chestnut are now being sold annually as stove coal , which sells for 60 cents more . Here the operators make $621,000 annually . " In addition , in order to get a larger amount of ptove coal , which is the highest-priced . " size , they have increased its mesh so that 14 per cent . of the egg coal can fall into it . This amounts to 1,481,000 tons . The difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit of $740,500 annually . " Even what is left- of , the first grade of steam coal . buckwheat No. 1 , is being diluted . It has in the past had an allowance of 15 per cent . of smaller sizes in it . This lies now been increased to 20 per cent . This addition amounts to 468,000 tons . The difference in price Is 90 cents . The total gain annually to the operators here is $421,740 . " The grand tqtal of underhanded profit to be made in this way , not counting the amounts made by changing to the round mesh and the amounts arbitrarily taken by the ? more unscrupulous operators , is $15,693,790 annually , a great deal more than a million dollars a month which operators are filching from pockets of the public by selling inferior grades at prices of superior grades . " We do not object to the legitimate efforts of the operators to sell their steam sizes , but when they inform the public that they are not selling them and ' that they are not making any money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hypocrisy of the situation is repugnant to the minds of honest men . " Secs Scarcity and High Prices . Mr. Lewis , in telling the American public of the Winter he believed to be ahead , said : - " The people have been told during the past sixty days . first , that they need not fear a suspension , and then that there was ample coal on hand . Foolish public men have created for the American people a fool 's paradise , and they are due for a fool 's awakening . If the mines were to start tomorrow it is extremely unlikely , from present prospects , that production and distribution would catch up with fuel requirements before the coming of next Spring : " In the meantime , he said , wholesalers and retailers would be " making hay while the sun shines . " He said chestnut coal was already selling at $18 -a ton in Philadelphia and as high as $10.50 on Long island , which , he declared , represented advance ? sit it to 15 A Loa ova. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sept. 1 . " It will be sold at an additional increase far in excess of these figures . " he said , As to substitute fuels , Mr. Lewis quoted engineers as saying the by-product I coke industry was able to producee only ' enough of that commodity to cure for its1 own needs , and could not increase facilities to meet additional demands from hard coal users . Scrapping of anthracite-burning equipment for installation of oil burners , he called prohibitive to the wage earners In most sections of the anthracite market . Soft coal , as another substitute , was dangerous , he said , because in homes where chimneys were built for hard coal , burning of bituminous coal " will mean the wholesale asphyxiation of families . " Furthermore : he said , railway facilities would be unable to transport enough soft coal into the 60,000 communities commonly using anthracite to meet the needs , " even , if they could burn it . " Reviewing the controversy between the miners and mine owners up to the breaking off of negotiations at Atlantic City on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now , nor will there be later , any question of the mine workers faltering in the step they have undertaken or departing from the policy which they have laid down . They have every appreciation of the responsibilities of such a contest , but they believe that thrice arrfled , indeed , is he whose cause Is just , and they have decided to carry on . come what may . " Mr. Lewis told again the poor return he said anthracite mine workers re . reived for the hazards they underwent . Severity per cent . of the 158,000 ? men averaged between $4.62 to $5.96 per day . he said , and the remaining 30 per cent . of skilled contract miners averaged substantially less than $2,000 a year . 1,210,000 Men " Butchered , " He Says . I Yet , he said , injuries averaged an annual loss per man of twenty-five days ' working time . In 1024 he declared 20,241 men were injured and since 1870 " the anthracite industry has butchered 1,210 , - 000 of our people . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this most extraordinary service the In-en render that their employers end the society of our country recognize that service and at least pay them for it . " Mr. Lewis dealt bitterly with what he called the grudging attitude of the min ? , owners . He said that in the memory of the present union , the owners had never once " voluntarily conceded a point of Consideration . " Two war increases granted had been forced upon the owners . He said , because otherwise , hey could have not kept the men In the-coal fields , so much more lucrative were wages in other industries . " If the owners elect , as they do , " he said , " to run true to form and never retreat except under fire , then their employes , as represented in the United Mine Workers . of America , are prepared today to engage them in battle upon the points at issue . If it takes industrial warfare , the , responsibility must lie with the magnates whose policy it is to take all and give nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole thing is that the American people will be made the chief sufferers . " CALLS LEWIS CHARGE FALSE , New Anthracite Standards Higher , Operators ' Spokesman Says . A spokesman for the anthracite operators declared here yesterday that Mr. Lewis 's charge that steam ' Sizes were being mixed with domestic sizes and sold to the public at old prices was " absolutely false . " " In March , 1925 , " he said , " the operators , at the urgent requests of public officials and everybody interested , published in the mat prominent way they , could the adoption of new standards , the principal reason far which was to make possible the checking up of everybody selling stove coal , whether operator or dealer . " In no case has steam coal been introduced into domesic sizes , nor have there been any other changes besides those the new standards provide . " A certain amount of breakage is. caused in shipping stove coal from the mines , but the- permissible limit of auch breakage has been fixed by the new standards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ones .
