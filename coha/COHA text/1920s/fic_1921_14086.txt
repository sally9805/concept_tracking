Before the rise of the curtain , CANETTO is heard singing very merrily . CANETTO " Le vin est bon et bel et blanc.Fort et fer et fin et franc , Freit et fres et fourmijant ! " The rise of the curtain discovers the scene at twilight . ( A soldier stands at the window looking out over the sea . He comes down the stair . He pauses a moment . He looks up at the door of FIAMMA 'S chamber . ) CANETTO stands in the window . He is a smallish , alert man , dark , pale Italian . Sometimes he will seem very young to us , sometimes old and hardened . He is strangely clad in a kind of faded motley , worn , perhaps , by hard riding and rough beds . His cloak trails down below his feet . He is watching those on the stage below him . ( Three servants enter . ) They are three peasants . AMINA , a waiting woman , is vulgar , gaudy and noisy . She is strewing the floor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , GIOVANNA , scrubs the table . THE SOLDIER Mind you , no talk with Fiamma . Ugoline wo n't allow it . He goes . AMINA There 's that singing again ! So clean it up , he said . p. 3 MADDELENA Who , the old Captain ? Well , we 're cleaning . He 's a good soul . GIOVANNA It needs a cleaning , too . The filthy , stinkin ' pig-sty . CANETTO comes to the stair rail and listens to them . He is mightily amused by their talk . AMINA We 're to have all we can eat and drink tonight . There 'll be a boar a wild boar roasted . We 've not had that since Easter . MADDELENA Fish , always fish . That 's what we get Even on feast nights . GIOVANNA Feasting and fighting ! One day you dig a grave to bury your man , The next you cook a feast to feed his Captain . AMINA Do n't you know we 're at war ? GIOVANNA I do n't know any good of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her alone ? She 's lost her man . AMINA Is that my fault ? She turns to GIOVANNAWhat are you complaining about ? We belong to Ugolino , do n't we ? And your man did , too , before the wars killed him ? And Ugolino 's Ghibelline , is n't he ? And does n't that mean that he must fight For the German Emperor against the Pope ? p. 4 GIOVANNA It 's sin to fight against the Pope ! AMINA But that 's the way of wars Between us Ghibellines and those swine , the Guelfs . The Pope would drive the Emperor out of Italy ; The Emperor would shut the Pope up in a box . There is n't room in Italy for both . MADDELENA That 's plain enough . AMINA And now the master , Who has been fighting , will be coming home , And wants a feast to drink the Emperor 's health , And damn the Pope . MADDELENA Is it true Canetto brought word from the master ? AMINA You have n't seen Canetto ? CANETTO is vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the master 's lieutenant . MADDELENA And his councillor , too . There must be something in the wind If he comes here . He 's never come before  --   --  Not in my day . AMINA Nor in mine . I 've only heard of him . They say he 's very fine and very clever , But cruel cruel . CANETTO bows . MADDELENA Yes . GIOVANNA Then what 's he doing here ? More tricks to pester her ? p. 5 AMINA I should n't mind . She 's proud enough . She wants a taking down . MADDELENA Maybe the master brings him here To help him woo his hostage , If he 's so clever . Each one , in turn , looks up toward the door of FIAMMA 'S chamber . GIOVANNA She is so good , Madonna Fiamma . She cured my son of the fever , Simply by praying . AMINA I do n't believe she cured him . GIOVANNA And there 's Amelia 's son , A cripple since he was born , Begging on the steps of the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deny that 's true . AMINA Prrrt ! MADDELENA Well , there 's my starving cousin Beppe , too . He never caught enough fish To feed his family . She blessed his boat for him , and now He 's rich with fishing . CANETTO Bored with this , resumes his song from where he stands . The women see him for the first time . Le vin est bel et bon et blanc . Fort et fer et fin et franc , Freit et fres et fourmijant . AMINA Oh , God save us ! MADDELENA A player ! p. 6 GIOVANNA It 's a jester Come to amuse Madonna Fiamma CANETTO Wrong , gentlewomen , it 's a little dog Sniffing for hidden bones . MADDELENA It is a jester ! AMINA Sit up and speak ! MADDELENA Play dead ! AMINA Throwing a rush at him.Carry and fetch ! CANETTO Hmmmmmm . Sweet wondrous sweet ! How marvelous These common rushes of the fields should hide Such exquisite aroma ! It 's lilac , violet , and spikenard And makes an April garden . You smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMINA I shall have roses in my hair tonight , I shall drink wine and have fine food to eat , And I shall have my lover to myself . CANETTO Chasing her.Scatter your rushes thick , I 'll dance upon ' em ; Scatter your rushes , I will be your love ! Catches her.There 's a feast tonight ? MADDELENA The master 's coming home . GIOVANNA For what my lady cares He need n't come at all ; These rushes on the floor Will be his bed ! p. 7 CANETTO Oh , gossip with me ! How I love to hear What ladies leave their husbands in the cold ! AMINA The master 's not her husband . CANETTO She 's your lord 's mistress ? AMINA Not even that  --  His prisoner . CANETTO Alas poor lady ! And her husband too ? AMINA Not he ! He 's safe away from here ! MADDELENA Her husband is the master 's enemy . AMINA We 're Ghibelline , we 're for the Emperor , always . He 's Guelf . They say That he 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damiano . CANETTO Oh , I remember him . I saw him once . A very brief pause.What is her name ? AMINA Fiamma . CANETTO Like an echo.Fiamma ! AMINA The people hereabouts All think her holy and beautiful . I call her proud , I do . GIOVANNA She is so good . And she has such fine jewels . p. 8 AMINA As for her jewels , Ugolino gives ' em to her . MADDELENA Yes  --  that 's her kind . She may have jewels  --   --  But  --  you know ! GIOVANNA She is so good . AMINA So good she ca n't abide the master . To me the wonder is he 'll trouble with her . CANETTO He speaks to himself , as from the most intimate depths of his memory . I saw her once in Rome , between the glare And darkness of a torch . She is an ageless creature Of vivid moods and colors . It 's plain enough throats have been cut for her . AMINA shrugs her shoulders and moves away.Which of you is her waiting woman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANETTO Maria ? Where is she ? AMINA She will be going to the village Upon Madonna 's errands . JACOPONE enters , staggering under the weight of two tremendous logs . He puts them on the fire , and kneels before the hearth to blow the blaze up . GIOVANNA Hi , woodman . JACOPONE Hold your noise . p. 9 GIOVANNA What 's to do , Jacopone ? AMINA We 've made the room clean As a wedding bed . MADDELENA Laughing coarsely.As my lady 's bed , There 's nothing cleaner . AMINA Has the master come yet ? JACOPONE Not yet , he has n't , Near vespers , too . CANETTO JACOPONE has not observed him.Are you the guard ? JACOPONE How did you get in ? CANETTO You , quite unmistakably , must be The guard . How wonderful Is the all-seeing eye ! JACOPONE I do n't take talk from your kind . AMINA He 's a jester , Come to amuse Madonna . MADDELENA Says he 's a little dog , Sniffing for hidden bones . AMINA Speak , little dog , Sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggy , And wag your tail . JACOPONE The nasty whelp ! I 'll sniff him . CANETTO He has played dog for them . Now he reveals himself . " Little dog , " my friend , In the diminutive and common tongue Of vulgar usage , is to say Canetto . At this disclosure , the three women fairly cower together and JACOPONE falls over backward in his astonished fright. p. 10 JACOPONE Gesu ! CANETTO How far my reputation goes afield ! Suddenly military.Get hence , you trulls ! ! You , fetch me your Captain , soldier ! AMINA Oh , sir , we did not know . CANETTO I am in charge until my master comes . Now go . The four of them shudder through the door . At the same moment MARIA , a bustling , buxom peasant woman enters and makes for the stair . What is your name , my woman ? MARIA I am Maria , sir . Madonna Fiamma 's waiting woman . CANETTO Seems to throw caution to the winds . His eagerness is all too evident . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does well , is not unhappy , Tell me that she is still As I remember her ! MARIA Who are you , sir ? CANETTO I am Madonna 's friend . MARIA Madonna has no friends , sir , in this place . CANETTO But I I am her friend these many years . If I have never come before to her , The time was never ripe before . Now I am come , from Rome , To offer her my service . Oh , let me speak with her ! p. 11 MARIA Lord Ugolino , sir , does not allow That any stranger shall have speech with Fiamma . CANETTO Why not ? MARIA She is his prisoner . CANETTO She is his hostage . MARIA It is the same , since he will not release her . CANETTO Now that the Emperor 's plight is somewhat grave , The moment for her rescue has arrived . It is so long that I have waited . Take me to her at once MARIA At any moment Ugolino will have come . CANETTO I know I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , Maria ! MARIA Oh , sir , you hurt my arm . CANETTO Forgive me , good Maria ! MARIA She is about to take him up the stair . She turns.Do you come from her husband , Sir ? Are you Damiano 's man ? Before CANETTO can answer the CAPTAIN has entered . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Messire Canetto , You have disclosed yourself . He is an old man , still erect and strong , not in any wise perturbed by CANETTO . He dislikes him but he is too good a soldier to show disrespect. p. 12 MARIA Canetto ! She makes the sign of the cross . CANETTO Concealing his annoyance.My disguise wearied me . Your servants are true Ghibellines , Captain , they know my name ! He notices that MARIA is edging her way up the stair toward FIAMMA 'S door . He halts her . Maria , do not go to Madonna now . Get on about your business in the village And give no messages at all . What passed between us is forgotten , Do you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful means . Be off . MARIA goes . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I have no doubt your watch is well repaid , Messire Canetto ? CANETTO Yes , well enough . His eyes stray toward FIAMMA 'S door. I am embarked On the supreme adventure of my life . I am content . I 'd gratefully Accept a cup of wine . There is wine ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Of the countryside . CANETTO Wine of the countryside , May anywhere produce a miracle . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Calls out.Fetch wine . p. 13 CANETTO It 's very old , This tower . The place could stand a siege . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON These modern engines Would knock it down about our ears . Without speaking of FIAMMA , they both turn their heads toward the door of her chamber . CANETTO After a brief pause of silence.I 'm turned around . On which side is the sea ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Below that window . Guarded . No prisoner could escape . CANETTO Smiling.She is the Emperor 's hostage . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Messire Canetto . CANETTO That is her chamber , I suppose ? Again both their faces turn toward the door . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON It opens only on the gallery . The chapel is beyond . CANETTO A chapel ? What priest officiates at mass ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON A hermit from the mainland . CANETTO So ? A hermit from the mainland ? He may prove interesting , This hermit . He , and this good Maria , Who , as she pleases , comes and goes . You keep a cheerful prison here , my friend . He draws a necklace of emeralds from his blouse and holds it in his hand. p. 14 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I am a soldier , not a jailor , sir , She is a hostage , not a prisoner . CANETTO I marvel less she should collaborate So deftly with her captor 's enemies . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON How then ? CANETTO shows him the emeralds . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Those emeralds . Why , Ugolino gave them to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurer in Rome . My master woos his hostage generously , And brings her various and precious spoils Which , she assures him , Amuse her . But which , in fact , Inevitably come to her Damiano Who , with this Spanish Jew ( I cut his throat Only to give good measure in my bargain ) , Bartered this bauble for its worth in gold Wherewith to pay the very soldiery Whose cross bows force the Emperor 's retreat . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Gesu ! CANETTO I mean to study How she has reached Damiano and resuscitated him Out of his mire of exile . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I will pay any penalty . CANETTO Who speaks of penalties ? I see that you are honest . But it were well you understood How you have played the traitor by your laxness . And helped the Pope against your Emperor . p. 15 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I have not been disloyal . I have known Fiamma . I could wish that Ugolino 's dealing Had been more honorable to her , For there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attempt the mingling of the two . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON His hand to his sword hilt.I am a true Ghibelline . God save the Emperor ! CANETTO A dry sneer.No other can . But JACOPONE enters with the wine at this moment and he changes the subject . Stamping his foot.The floor is hollow . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Dungeons . CANETTO Indicates the trap.By this door ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Opens trap.Will you go down , sir ? CANETTO Peers down.No . Is that a rack ? CAPTAIN nods.In good repair ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Very dry tone.In excellent repair . p. 16 CANETTO A rack at times assumes a certain value . CAPTAIN closes trap . JACOPONE goes ; CANETTO returns to the subject . CANETTO This castle will be vacant in two days . There may be fighting . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I have but four And twenty serviceable men . CANETTO You will have heard , How ill the Emperor 's affairs have prospered . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I know a battle has been fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day is to the Guelfs , my friend . Certain enough we shall not linger here . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Germany ? Neither of them enjoys this prospect . CANETTO Alas ! Italians do not thrive out of the sun . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON And when we flee , Madonna Fiamma ? CANETTO With us . His eyes again stray to the door of Fiamma 's chamber . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON She is a hostage honorably given by the Pope Against an honorable return ! p. 17 CANETTO She is a victim of the tricks of war And of the tricks of life together . She was a hostage given by the Pope To prove his holy faith . Now , if my master holds her over-long , It is to prove his love . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Better that he should prove His honor and agreement . CANETTO The reckless circumstance of war Plays havoc with agreement , sir , And oftentimes is ignorant of honor . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I warn you she is much beloved And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE GARRISON By all those hereabouts . The villagers bring her their sick . CANETTO Keenly interested.You mean She heals the sick ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON She has a power in her prayer . The villagers are wont To lie beneath her window in their boats  --   --  She blesses them . CANETTO What do you think of her ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Not easily measured . Strong . Delicious , too . Fearsome as holy folk may be . CANETTO Young ? p. 18 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON She has led armies to Jerusalem ; She has been Empress in Byzantium . CANETTO All this is much as I imagined it . These many years and more Since I have seen her . Why has he spared her ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Ugolino ? CANETTO Why ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON She makes Men better for her strong belief in man . Trumpet without . CANETTO That will be Ugolino , now . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I 'll welcome him . The CAPTAIN rises again and goes towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He points towards the door . MARIA enters . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON You return , Maria , from the village ? MARIA Captain , yes . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Go to Madonna , then . MARIA Breathless with news.They say the Emperor Has been defeated . In the public square We have been singing and the hermit preached . p. 19 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Why did you sing ? MARIA Folk should rejoice . And all the burghers came Down from the city and shook their spears Against this castle . Folk do n't like the master . Then he came . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Ugolino ? MARIA M-m , and scattered them . And there 's a tale afoot to say That he will take Madonna Fiamma Away with him tomorrow . It is not true , good Captain ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Oh , I hope It is not true . MARIA And then the master Called for a boat and followed me across . But I made better speed . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ended The people dance and everyone eats cakes . It 's very gay . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON No doubt . MARIA You do not think . Madonna must go with them ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON With them ? MARIA Sure , Being the Emperor 's men , They can not linger here . They say an army 's on march from Rome . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Madonna will be waiting for her silks . p. 20 MARIA Yes , Captain Yes She disappears through the door of FIAMMA 'S chamber . As she opens it , the place is seen as light and color . It grows darker . Another trumpet sounds . CANETTO And so with silks We while away Madonna 's time . She who 's Damiano 's wife , Damiano who destroys us And drives the Emperor from Italy . Turns suddenly with a snarl on the CAPTAIN.You fool , you swine , you lout ! If I Should put you to the rack The CAPTAIN 'S calm restores CANETTO to himself.For all his victory , Damiano shall not have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The CAPTAIN goes . CANETTO glares after him for a moment.Madonna 's silks ! He softens . Another trumpet sounds . He smiles to himself and listens at the door . He swings about abruptly and bounds up the stairs to FIAMMA 'S door . His hands seem to sink into its panels , his breath is hot against it , he speaks in a strained whisper . Fiamma , three men have loved you , Your husband and my master and myself Which of us will you love To-morrow ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Off stage.Fall in , men ! Attention ! Front ! Lord Baron Ugolino , I welcome you . p. 21 UGOLINO Crying , off stage.Fiamma ! Fiamma ! CANETTO has just time to turn and welcome his master . Whereupon UGOLINO enters gorgeously . His mail glitters like silver . He wears a magnificent mantle . Jewels shine at his throat and in his belt and his head is bare so that his fair , curling hair falls to his shoulders . He is a northern type , a physique of great strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still young . He is accompanied by two guards dressed in the colors of the Emperor with the black lion on their chests . One of these carries his master 's sword , the other his helmet . UGOLINO comes quickly centre as though he did not see anyone in the gloom . The guards advance slightly . The light of torches shines through the open door . UGOLINO His authority vanishing . He is only weary and distraught . Oh , Canetto , mine . I have such need of counsel . He pauses and his eyes turn to FIAMMA 'S door.Fiamma . Fiamma . CANETTO Master , you said That you had need of counsel ? UGOLINO I said ? What matter I said ? Canetto , have you seen her ? CANETTO Seen whom , dear master ? p. 22 UGOLINO Fiamma . CANETTO No . UGOLINO No ? No . You are right , Canetto . CANETTO You come direct from Rome ? UGOLINO From Rome . CANETTO I , too . UGOLINO I have seen the towns ' processions with their banners : I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from battlements and towers , And girls that dance with garlands , And nobles kissing burghers in the streets , And I have heard the crowds That howl hosannahs of thanksgiving To celebrate our defeat . I , the leader of the Ghibellines , I was in flight before them ! ! ! THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Ah ! CANETTO There is no wrath abroad . But only joy more terrible than wrath , Against such joy we are the drifting smoke Before the winds of May . UGOLINO We must make haste , Canetto . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON You came here unmolested , Master ? UGOLINO No . One excellent encounter . Behind the hills . Yonder . They ambushed us . Two score of them  --  or more . I do not rightly know , My sight was blinded by their festivals That I had seen along the road . I sent them squealing . My horse 's hooves were gummed with them . Their blood spattered my hair . p. 23 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON The Pope 's men ? UGOLINO Damiano 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in Rome . Damiano is in Rome . He whispers to the Pope . His eyes are now fixed once more upon the door of FIAMMA 'S chamber . The Pope has sent To bid me give her up . Almost a cry of pain.Oh , I ca n't live and give her up ! CANETTO I do not think Damiano is in Rome . UGOLINO I know he is . CANETTO He will have left by this . Master I crave your leave To speak alone with you . UGOLINO Go , all of you . Canetto has command . Put down my sword . The guard lays the sword upon the table . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON And it is true , we leave The castle in two days ? CANETTO Await me in my closet , Captain . Go . Directly thither . I shall come to you . Captain , double the guard ! THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON My Lord . He goes . The GUARD follows . CANETTO and UGOLINO are alone together. p. 24 CANETTO Looking after them.My worthy Captain , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is faithful . CANETTO He has known Fiamma . She is like the summer sun . She shines , and in an hour The flower of man 's loyalty is withered . In all the armies of the Guelfs There is no sword so perilous as her smile . And I grow curious to learn How this may be . For I have never seen her . Only a glimpse So long ago . UGOLINO A glimpse were not enough to fathom her , As you will learn , Canetto . His discouragement shakes him . His eyes again turn to the door of FIAMMA 'S room . Fiamma ! The flame That scorches up my spirit . What has she done to me ? I have been strong before . Am I a weakling now ? She saps the power of my arms , she saps My strength and all my will . Three times I have come here to her and three Times gone away again , repulsed . Only her eyes ! They are enough ! Oh , when I fight , I see them then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has she done to me ? Honor or shame , what do they mean , Canetto ? A desperate , hysterical laugh breaks from his lips.I have forgotten . CANETTO He has listened , his eyes upon his master , contempt on his lips . Now he will bring the conversation to his ends once more . Honor or shame ? Who knows what they may be ? Meantime , We 'll keep the Captain in our company . p. 25 UGOLINO I shall trust none of them but you . CANETTO I do not think Damiano is in Rome . Master , I am quite certain he will come , Here to this island and this very night . UGOLINO How do you know ? CANETTO My eyes , Master , my ears , my sense of touch And various other things . UGOLINO And if he come ? CANETTO My plans are fashioned in a close mosaic . I hold the little stone of his escape , But I can find no place to fit it in . UGOLINO How will it be ? CANETTO How will a sea-gull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . UGOLINO Throw food ? CANETTO He knows you have another hostage . now . UGOLINO Another hostage ? Whom ? CANETTO His son , Fiorenzo . UGOLINO Oh ! Canetto ! CANETTO I was not idle while I stayed in Rome , I sought I found I stole his little son . Madonna Fiamma 's son where he was hidden . p. 26 UGOLINO Where is the child ? CANETTO Here in this castle serving me as page . Is it not comical ? I think that I may give him to Madonna . It were expedient means . To win her to your ends and to prevent Her plans of rescue . Even CANETTO must smile at this and glance at the door . UGOLINO You do not know how strong she is , Canetto . CANETTO Must you be weak ? Take her or kill her Master . UGOLINO Belike I shall kill her some day . Trumpets without and enter the CAPTAIN and a SOLDIER . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Begging your pardon , Master . Here 's a messenger from Rome . UGOLINO My man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope . UGOLINO These Guelfs Are thirsty for our blood ! Dare we refuse him entrance ? CANETTO Is he alone ? CAPTAIN looks to the SOLDIER to speak . THE SOLDIER There is one other with him . The townsfolk , too , are coming in their boats . p. 27 UGOLINO This is my house  --  my house ! CANETTO Good master , pray Take counsel of me now . To the CAPTAIN.Bring in the messenger And quickly . The CAPTAIN and the SOLDIER go out . UGOLINO He is come for her . CANETTO But will go hence with empty hands . UGOLINO You are my wits , you are my eyes , Canetto . And all my judgments . CANETTO Now I promise you , For that fair tribute , This very night of nights you shall attain Your two desires Your vengeance on your enemy in blood , And afterwards your woman . UGOLINO Canetto ! CANETTO On his toes , exultant , strangely and thrillingly young . Oh , love , headlong , vehement , You triumph over reason , over shame , And hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vision of a man And you exact his martyrdom and laugh ! The last lines have rung out over trumpets prolonged and a subdued turmoil off-stage . At the and the NUNCIO enters , preceded by the CAPTAIN and followed by two of UGOLINO 'S soldiers , with lighted torches . The NUNCIO is a churchman , not so old as the CAPTAIN . He wears the clothes of any horseman except for the necklace and insignia of his ecclesiastical position. p. 28 CANETTO Your Grace is welcome . THE PAPAL NUNCIO Which one of you may be The Baron Ugolino ? CANETTO Here is my master . THE PAPAL NUNCIO My business is with you . He draws a parchment scroll from his cloak and holds it toward the surly UGOLINO . UGOLINO Canetto , read . CANETTO snatches the scroll . THE PAPAL NUNCIO His hand to his sword.Canetto ? CANETTO smiles , bows , and opens scroll.Sir , you are bold To speak to me . CANETTO As you To enter here , your Grace . But This is no rat trap set for clergymen . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holiness . CANETTO It is the same . To UGOLINO.The usual demand . UGOLINO For Fiamma ? CANETTO Shall I make answer , Master ? UGOLINO Yes . CANETTO Go back again to Rome . Fiamma is Ugolino 's hostage still , Who ever comes In ten days time to Trent , Upon the border of the north , Madonna Fiamma will await him there , But thither she must go with us. p. 29 THE PAPAL NUNCIO My lord , You send this answer ? UGOLINO Yes . THE PAPAL NUNCIO And you receive . The messenger of the Pope so easily Your servant answers him ? UGOLINO Yes . Yes . CANETTO These days along the roads of Italy Fiamma will give protection more worth while Than any word of any Pope . THE PAPAL NUNCIO I warn You , Baron Ugolino . UGOLINO I 've heard enough . Increasing commotion in the distance and cries . CANETTO Safety , my friend , that is the question now . You know our situation . We ride tomorrow . Say so to the Pope . Madonna Fiamma is unhurt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Trent for her . THE PAPAL NUNCIO If I demand a word with her . CANETTO Your Grace , I must refuse . My word is all . Commotion without louder . THE PAPAL NUNCIO The fisherfolk and villagers Know of your plan . You will not pass With Fiamma . CANETTO I stake my sword against a fisher 's net At any time . p. 30 THE PAPAL NUNCIO I am the vicar of the vicar of Christ . You do assail a greater word than mine . CANETTO I proffer you a cup of wine , your Grace . THE PAPAL NUNCIO Which I refuse . CANETTO Having filled one glass , lifts it.We must each profit as we may and each One yield his tribute to the other 's state . He drinks . JACOPONE has entered and whispered to the Captain . THE PAPAL NUNCIO I shall return more forcefully . CANETTO Your Grace . Delivering your answer to the Pope , Say that you had a courteous reception . THE PAPAL NUNCIO A moment 's parley with Madonna Fiamma ? CANETTO You deserve credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a delegation Of village folk and burghers Concerned for Fiamma , Demanding that no harm Shall come to her . UGOLINO Send them away ! CANETTO A moment , Master . A moment of thought.Your Grace , I reconsider . p. 31 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON You know how many men I have . CANETTO And they ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Some hundreds in their boats . THE PAPAL NUNCIO I 'll call to them . CANETTO And calling take your leave of life . Desperate men chastise their enemies With prompt decision How numerous the delegation , Captain ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Eight . CANETTO Why , then , Madonna Fiamma will receive them here . UGOLINO No ! CANETTO motions to JACOPONE who goes to obey the order . CANETTO You see how well defeated men may learn To bow before the dictates of defeat . An Emperor bows before a Pope , A Ghibelline before a Guelf . Now you may speak With Fiamma , though I said you nay A moment since . We drink , your Grace , to peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies not yet raised . He drinks . The hubbub is just off stage.Master , here are your loyal subjects . First one , a burgher with a short spear , then two farmers and a fisherman with clubs , then three women and a boy , enter . Guards follow them . Other guards stand in the passage . It has grown much darker . The tower is all purple with the twilight . The figures in the foreground are lighted only by the fitful glare of the firelight . The window shines , a black arched radiance of violet sky . Very softly , as from a great distance , borne on a wind that falls and rises , the first bells of vespers come over the water. p. 32 A MAN Madonna Fiamma ! Madonna Fiamma ! ANOTHER WOMAN Queen . A WOMAN Oh , gracious lady . A THIRD MAN A Protector of the catch . ANOTHER WOMAN Lady of Consolation . CANETTO Draw back , my lord , it were the safer course They should not see you in this mood of theirs . Draw back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to us , Madonna . Oh , come and speak to us and bend Your face upon our faces Here and here , Madonna Fiamma . Listen to our need . Madonna Fiamma , do not leave us . We have come , Madonna , we have come To offer you protection . You shall not go away against your will . The Emperor has fallen . Fiamma . Fiamma . Madonna , star of evening on the sea . Oh , little plant that we have loved . Madonna Fiamma . The bells are louder . Very slowly the door of FIAMMA 'S chamber swings open and we see her . A sigh goes up at her appearance . The peasants fall on their knees . If we have ever stood in a great gothic church of Northern France and looked down the length of the nave at the apse window which glorifies the Virgin Mary , we shall think of that moment in this first glimpse of FIAMMA . Indeed , she is very like the Virgin of some glowing window when the sun is bright behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber . Her beautiful head is held very high . She is queenly . But she is kind , too . Her eyes and hands say so . And she is not quite as other women . There is an aura about her head and all the splendor of her dress seems to smile upon the darkness of the tower . She advances slowly to the head of the stair. p. 33 UGOLINO Oh , see . CANETTO Hush . UGOLINO Fiamma . Fiamma . These are whispers above the complete silence of the moment . CANETTO A meditative sorrow . How beautiful she is ! UGOLINO Is she not beautiful , Canetto ? Like The Virgin Mary in her queenliness . And she is just and altogether human . CANETTO She is a woman . A MAN Lady of Glory lady of mystery . A WOMAN Madonna , say you will not leave us . FIAMMA She does not answer . She has come partly down the stair and the strange light of her presence seems still to shine about her . She looks down upon the speakers and smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall save you , from them . We shall bring the hermit here to lead us . FIAMMA Her head , her arms , something about her seems to say that there is no need . A WOMAN See , Madonna , see . My son can walk again . You prayed for him he walks again , Madonna . Oh , thank you , bless you . p. 34 FIAMMA She sees and is glad . ANOTHER WOMAN Coming forward with her baby wrapped like the bambini of della Robbia . Pray for him , too , Madonna , he is sick . He is so little . FIAMMA She takes the child in her arms , for she has come to the foot of the stair now . The WOMAN kneels at her feet . She holds the child tenderly and prays . THE PAPAL NUNCIO This is mystery She stands upon the silver threshold . She Is marvellous and admirable . Madonna Fiamma , I am come to you from the throne of Peter , I have seen a wonderful thing here , I have seen peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I kneel Reverently at your feet . FIAMMA She turns and looks at him . THE PAPAL NUNCIO You will be saved , Madonna . You will be saved , tomorrow . Men will come fighting if need be . FIAMMA Does something frighten her ? It seems so . A MAN We will save , you , Madonna Fiamma . We the burghers of the city will save you . We will come with the weapons of our masters And break the gates apart , And you will live forever in our midst And make our city whole and sweet . p. 35 FIAMMA She smiles now and shakes her head . A WOMAN What does it matter if our men Perish for you , Madonna ? FIAMMA Her hand goes toward the woman in protest . A MAN The while we live there can no peril come To frighten you . A MAN Command us . ANOTHER WOMAN Speak your will to us . ANOTHER WOMAN Speak , Madonna what is your will . THE PAPAL NUNCIO Spring of all mercies , beacon of all glories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FIAMMA Because at this moment the wind seems to have strengthened again , the vespers bells are louder . She lifts her hand for silence , then , in her low , vibrant voice , she intones the Pater Noster in Latin . After the first two or three phrases , the peasants and the NUNCIO follow her and , later , the guards , the last of whom to stand falls on his knees as the curtain descends very slowly. @x The prayer finished , she looks once intensely over the kneeling peasants , lifts her hand in a blessing and farewell and turns very slowly to go up the stair to the window . One by one the peasants rise to their feet . They seem completely calmed . One or two of them , in pantomime seem to beg FIAMMA 'S leave to rescue her . One or two threaten the soldiers with their fists . They murmur about the hermit and say to one another , " He must be fetched to speak with her . " They go . MARIA Who has come down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would not have your suffering on her heart . You hurt her when you ask her . Go . You will make her weep . CANETTO Be very certain Damiano will come here tonight , Master . UGOLINO Why then ? CANETTO You have the pair of them . UGOLINO She is worth more than vengeance . CANETTO Go quickly , now , And make no sound at all . I 'll speak with her . UGOLINO protests in pantomime.Give me a little time . I guarantee She shall grow amiable . Do you attend the Nuncio . UGOLINO goes after the NUNCIO , his last look at FIAMMA . As CANETTO stands beside the fire , his dark cloak drawn about him , he seems almost a part of the arras . FIAMMA stands in the gallery , now , her lovely head silhouetted against the luminous twilight sky . The bells continue faintly and do not cease entirely until CANETTO speaks to her later . The interior of the tower is becoming more and more exquisitely blue . The single bright light in the scene is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIAMMA The scent of seaweed weighs the warm , sweet air , Lonely and beautiful , the hush of dark Descends on all created life , Another day is gone behind the hills , Another wind is silent on the sea . I hear you , bells of vespers , and I know The eloquence of destiny is loud In your deep voices ; Your benediction shares its peace with me And leaves me strong to breathe The infinite beatitude of night ; And blessed beauty glistens on the world And on my hair and lips and hands and eyes Like dew upon the flowers of the dawn , Like April on the yearning of the earth With tears of life that comes again to life Rebuilded and renewed . MARIA I go to watch , Madonna . I know it can not fail tonight , Just at the change o ' the watch , Just as you planned it . Ah , Damiano said , " How crafty is my Fiamma To know when men are sleepiest ! " FIAMMA Without turning from her contemplation of the evening sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you not , Madonna ? FIAMMA I do not think so . Only wise As women may be . MARIA Be of good cheer , Madonna . Tonight is sure . MARIA goes directly out . FIAMMA Oh , Damiano , We shall remember , afterwards , these months Of my captivity and your wandering As a time after illness that has been Wherein we gathered strength again for life Together , strength for faith , Each in the other Stars who bear witness to my weariness Bring us together once before we die , I was not born for loneliness , my youth Is almost gone . Before it passes quite , Bring him again to me tonight you stars . Perhaps the wind rises once again , perhaps the Host is elevated in some chapel on the shore , for the bells swell out . FIAMMA drops her head in prayer. p. 38 CANETTO Coming forward.Madonna . FIAMMA You , Maria ? CANETTO The dark falls swiftly on the sea , Madonna . FIAMMA turns and , for the first time , notices CANETTO . She comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fire has flared up . CANETTO Will you come down to me ? A sea bird , balanced on distended wings Might float into your reverent seclusion And , by comparison with your fair grace , Seem a distorted and obnoxious thing . Shall I , who am a graceless man , Bred in the rough adventure of the world , Who only , humbly sue the privilege Of a brief word , Madonna , desecrate The shrine your presence sanctifies ? FIAMMA You speak Graciously , sir . A prisoner Is scarcely loth to see a stranger 's face To talk a moment 's time beyond confinement . She comes down slowly , pausing at least once to look more closely at CANETTO . CANETTO You do me honor and I bear you tidings . My master , Ugolino , craves permission To sup this evening with you in your tower . FIAMMA Am I to welcome him ? CANETTO But if I brought you other news of one More near your heart , Madonna ? p. 39 FIAMMA News of whom ? CANETTO The briefest pause.Damiano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead . FIAMMA Damiano who is dead ? I must have proof Of that . I do not think Damiano could have died and I not know . I think his passing spirit in the air Would have come here to whisper me farewell . CANETTO How if I give you proof ? FIAMMA The word alone Inspires me with no terror . I have seen A deal of death and had my heart and mind Begirt with horror . CANETTO He displays the emeralds.These are the emeralds which , I know not how , Came from this tower to his hands . FIAMMA See how they lie there , limply , yet so hard ! How bright they are ! It is as though you dipped A cup of water from the deepest sea And , in your hand , congealed it . CANETTO Do you know them ? FIAMMA Do you say My husband , dying , sent them to me ? CANETTO Yes . p. 40 FIAMMA I am not readily credulous of sorrow . CANETTO Alas , that I am sorrow 's messenger ! FIAMMA Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of some fame , Once on a time , who followed the Crusades And reigned as Empress in Byzantium . I have long floated upon turbulent waters , So long , these very rocks , Upon whose scarring surface I am dashed , Seem to me something of a haven , half Solicitous to comfort me . Yet I am still Fiamma . And this is strength to me , and gives Me more than ordinary fortitude , As if it were some special test of God To prove my spirit . And you do wrong to scoff before your time ; These emeralds are no property of yours , But of a certain Spanish Jew in Rome , To whom my husband sold them . CANETTO You confess ? FIAMMA Of what avail denial ? CANETTO You are brave . FIAMMA Who meets a lie with truth has drawn a sword Upon a man unarmed . CANETTO Am I outwitted ? FIAMMA I do not know the measure of your wits . I only know the arms of honesty Are long . It may be you are overreached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration.I can not lie Successfully to you , it seems . You know Too much of me I will cast paltry things aside , Truth , yes , and honor too ( Of men , not women ) , And send them whistling down To splash the offal of the silly world . p. 41 FIAMMA It is so long since I have laughed . I looked To find a mighty villain , sir , in you I find a boastful youth . She sits at the table and laughs at him . CANETTO No man is bad Enough to justify his reputation . There you perceive the cross the wicked man Must bear  --  that he is doomed Forever to fall short in wickedness ! He has become very gay and disarming . FIAMMA Alas , poor sinner ! CANETTO Canetto has become a pleasant fellow , Like all repentant sinners , still A little proud of sin , a little fond Of sinful memories . There is no vice was not a virtue once ! But I rejoice . I shall have found a friend Where I had sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pricked ! In you , I meet My first antagonist . FIAMMA Why , then CANETTO A flame.We 'll play A while upon the lips of death before Death swallows us ? I am a jongleur born And bred and trained and practised . I have gone To Chartres on pilgrimage and acted there The Miracles of Our Lady . I have been Court jester to an emperor and a king And confidant in the secret ways of states , And on the road once more and played buffoon In village squares of France and Italy , And sung a Roland for an Oliver In Michael 's monastery in the north And I have trained Horses to war and dogs to trickery And thieved and mocked and loved and laughed until My very livelihood was impudence . Shrugs his shoulders a little sadly.But jongleurs have no civil rights  --  alas , I am a man . Man must have civil rights . So I turned murderer and respectable . This for my lord , Ugolino , Whom I serve as faithfully as I may , Half as lieutenant , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . And when we move about The pilgrim crowded thoroughfares of Rome , Dressed in bright scarlet , I ride on before And play my lute , And do his bidding otherwise , without The least compunction , very glad , To have regained my civil rights , because To prance upon the air Were a scant pleasure to the lookers-on . To the performer , scanter still . Perhaps I may yet die of palsy in a bed And , with all due serenity , look back Upon these varied images of myself , Dancing across the nations of the world . p. 42 FIAMMA She has laughed at his story but her face at the end is grim . Is this Canetto ? A bow from him.Vagabond ! A deeper bow.I understand you now . She rises , an Empress.And you would tell me his great heart is stilled ! As if I should not know ! CANETTO I find Your high defiance admirable . FIAMMA And true . CANETTO You are proud . FIAMMA No , very humble . CANETTO Yet you frustrate my lord At every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , For which I honor him . I would I might Find him more honorable in himself . CANETTO How well I understand my master now ! FIAMMA Why , sir , I hope you do CANETTO How you disarm him as you now disarm My subtle craft , Madonna . FIAMMA Are you crafty ? More than your clumsy master 's tool ? CANETTO Much more as I might be to you , Madonna . FIAMMA is bitterly amused.You are not kind , Madonna . p. 43 FIAMMA Am I not ? CANETTO You are suspicious . FIAMMA Ah , you guess that , too ? CANETTO I crave your confidence . FIAMMA My confidence ! CANETTO Why not ? What deep assurance can I give To make you trust me ? FIAMMA None , I thank you , sir . CANETTO Have you not heard The story of the sinner turned a saint ? FIAMMA A saint ? CANETTO The very meat And substance of all Christian doctrine ! I claim no halo . Good deeds are out of fashion nowadays , We are not knights and ladies anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes appraise her . She shudders . FIAMMA Ah , I read The riddle now CANETTO You read FIAMMA Reluctantly . CANETTO Did you now know That it would end so ? Are not these emeralds symbolical Of such an ending ? FIAMMA Perturbed.You are unkind to mock me. p. 44 CANETTO Let me swear To my sincerity . FIAMMA If , sir , you are sincere , I do not lack In thanks to you . If not , I bear no grudge . CANETTO And that is all ? I am not fortunate with womankind . I bring you proof of my devotion . He pockets the emeralds . FIAMMA No . CANETTO And you shall learn what quality of service You thoughtlessly refuse . Calling out.Send me my page ! FIAMMA Have done . In spite of herself her uneasiness grows during CANETTO 'S next words . CANETTO It is a boy , a child I 'll rear him as a pander or a knave , Which , I have not decided . He serves me well already . But , for the present while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you will of him . FIORENZO , the child , a boy of eight or nine years , has appeared in the doorway . He wears the motley of a page . He halts there , frightened and pale . FIAMMA A loud cry of horror.Ah ! CANETTO He grasps FIORENZO and drags him into the centre of the stage . Do not cry out , Madonna ! There is no harm in him . I stole him for you . He 's nobly born and will therefore become The better servant if you beat him well , As I have beaten him . He becomes more than ever the strolling player in the ensuing scene , dancing and laughing here and there on the stage , revelling in the most adroit jest of his career. p. 45 FIAMMA She reels suddenly and cries out in very desperate terror . My son my son . FIORENZO Are you my mother ? FIAMMA She is on her knees , her arms tight about the child 's neck . Fiorenzo , oh , my little son , Fiorenzo ! And in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madonna ? Accepting him , you make a fair exchange . His life against Your splendid liberty of soul . This is the lever of your obedience . FIAMMA For shame be silent . Oh , Fiorenzo . FIORENZO Mother ! CANETTO More and more delighted.You will obey no matter what command . FIAMMA Leave me CANETTO When I ordain You must accept my ordinance Even if I ? but time attends my wish We are no longer hurried . FIAMMA You planned this cleverly . CANETTO Oh , this superb Canetto ! Madonna Fiamma , am I not superb ? But , for the nonce , you sup . p. 46 FIAMMA Wicked ! CANETTO Agreeably with my master . FIAMMA Leave us CANETTO I plan FIAMMA Leave us , I say ! CANETTO I weave FIAMMA I God 's name , think He is a child . CANETTO I am a spider in my web His gestures are grotesque and horribly comic . He begins prancing about . FIAMMA Buffoon ! CANETTO A shout of triumph.BUFFOON ! ! ! Madonna , so I am . All hail buffoonery ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bring lights ! The mystery is set , Only the subject changed . We might have played The pastoral " Flight to Egypt . " What if we stay behind in Herod 's court And watch " The Massacre of the Innocents .

FIAMMA How long since you Have had your mother CANETTO Let me bless you p. 47 FIAMMA You are grown strong , my son You shall be my protector , now FIORENZO Where is my father ? FIAMMA He will come in time . CANETTO There 's not a doubt of that ! FIORENZO It is so dark here . FIAMMA Oh , no , tomorrow will be gay , my son . CANETTO This is the end , Madonna , of your hopes , The rainbows of calamity are out ! Lights bring us lights . I 'll see My triumph brightly ! for I meet My first antagonist and vanquish her . FIAMMA Furiously.Call me my woman here . A commotion is audible in the castle . AMINA enters bearing two tapers . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child and the kneeling FIAMMA . A SOLDIER comes with a torch . CANETTO Maria , hither ! Your mistress calls you ! Lights ! FIAMMA Oh , God , I cry to You for justice . CANETTO Obedience , Madonna . Remember the stern word . p. 48 FIAMMA You beast you thief you coward . CANETTO Sparks from the anvil of the flaming sword ! AMINA has withdrawn with the SOLDIER to the doorway . MARIA breaks through between them . FIAMMA Maria ! Her voice chokes . CANETTO Close to FIAMMA , he speaks his directions very quickly . Let there be no misunderstanding . All Must be as clear as fine French glass . Your son is come to bear you company , Because his Holiness recklessly demands The hostage 's return , because my master Will not consent to this , because , tomorrow , You ride with us . But presently The Nuncio of the Pope will speak with you . You will refuse to give my master up . FIAMMA Lifts her head during CANETTO 'S instructions and now rises to her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little son , Suddenly brought to me from Rome . To comfort me . He lodges in my chamber . We must find means to order things A little differently because of him . It does not greatly matter , I suppose . Now lay him in my bed . He is so sturdy . Whatever else befall us in this place , He must go safely out . Go , my Fiorenzo , go ; Maria 's kind . She has red cherries for you . p. 49 FIORENZO Mother . MARIA Oh , Madonna . In the meanwhile , too , very faintly at first , comes the sound of singing on the sea , the mingled voices of men and women singing the crusade hymn of Adam de St. Victor . SINGERS Ave , Virgo singularis , Mater nostri Salutaris , Quae vocaris Stella Maris , &nbsp; &nbsp; Stella non erratica ; Nos in hujas vitae mariNon permitte naufragari , Sed pro nobis Salutari &nbsp; &nbsp; Tuo semper supplica !

UGOLINO appears in the doorway . His face is flushed , his hair disordered , his hands are restless. p. 50 FIAMMA Lord Baron Ugolino , now , I learn , From your lieutenant 's word , that very soon I am to follow you to Germany . Well , it is well , I say , and say no more . In the meantime MARIA and FIORENZO have gone together up the stair . CANETTO Said I not so , my master ? UGOLINO Fiamma , my Fiamma , you will not regret . We two shall overpower all regrets . You will be Empress . CANETTO Go , one of you , and fetch the Nuncio here . A SOLDIER goes . UGOLINO Tomorrow will see armies take the field . Fiamma , for love of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows , creatures of the smoke , Flowers by candlelight . UGOLINO Oh , like enough , tomorrow will be foolish . Beneath FIAMMA 'S direct gaze he flinches . CANETTO No more , Dear master , she is honey , now , and wax . FIAMMA Oh , God , why is it that I can not hate ? UGOLINO You can no longer hate me , Fiamma ? The NUNCIO enters , led by the SOLDIER . p. 51 THE PAPAL NUNCIO Madonna Fiamma , You know my business . Let me bear your answer . FIAMMA Who is this man ? CANETTO This is the messenger from his Holiness . And indirectly from Damiano , too . FIAMMA What must I say ? CANETTO No more than I have said already . His Grace is still A veritable doubting Thomas , Will not believe that you accompany Us of your own free will nor that you bid Damiano find you out In Trent in ten days ' time . THE PAPAL NUNCIO Is that your word , Madonna Fiamma ? FIAMMA Her eyes beg for his understanding.Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem To glitter with so little meaning , yet , By devious interpretation , say Such diverse , beautiful and mysterious things That is my word to you CANETTO Madonna Fiamma , riddles but confuse An obvious issue . THE PAPAL NUNCIO Lady do you say ? FIAMMA No more CANETTO A word , Madonna , I beseech You by the right I have to ask Some petty favors of you . Let there be Conviction in your voice . p. 52 FIAMMA Without looking toward CANETTO . She draws a deep breath . Ten days from now In Trent upon the border of the north . I must remain a hostage until then . CANETTO Well said . UGOLINO Oh , Fiamma . THE PAPAL NUNCIO Willingly ? FIAMMA Not unwillingly , your Grace . You have my word . She turns , hearing the hymn which is now very clearly audible . What song is that ? A soldier has entered carrying a very regal robe and another follows him bearing a crown of precious Byzantine workmanship  --  enamelled and jewelled . WOMEN come after  --  enough so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breathlessly  --  still close to FIAMMA.I shall be Emperor and set your will Over the wills and words of all the earth , Over the Swords and Spears of all the earth , You bring such power to me . She has listened proudly , giving no sign that she heard his words . Falteringly , he takes her arm . See , Fiamma , see  --  my flight Was swift as any hare 's , Yet I brought treasures . I spill them at your feet . See , Fiamma , see the spoils that I have fetched ! I cast them at your feet ; O , tread upon them . They are nothing Beneath your gaze that burns them into dust . I know they are not worthy nothing is . He has led her toward the front of the scene directly in the centre . He takes the great robe . From its coffer and the crown from him who holds it .

And yet  --  oh , yet , Fiamma , be pitiful And let me give you them . The world contains no rarer treasures . I have emptied The treasure houses of the world . I know . He hands the crown back to the SOLDIER and displays the robe with a kind of childish eagerness , hoping vainly for some sign of her pleasure . Once on a time a King in Babylon Ordained the weaving of this mantle , Saying : " None is so beautiful as my queen . She shall be clad sublimely . " Once on another time A Queen in Samarkand Deemed herself worthy of such splendor , And all the Arabian East Worshipped her , wearing it . But afterwards men laid it by Against the time when , once more , perfect Beauty should walk the earth . Fiamma , that time has come . Alas ! How poor the robe enveloping your beauty ! Oh , yet , be pitiful and wear it ! He wraps it about FIAMMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some pre-Giottesque Madonna , all gold , immovable . Maria re-enters above from her mistress ' chamber. p. 53 AMINA I have seen the shrine of a miraculous image . It was less gorgeous than she . MARIA From the door above.She is like the Virgin ! She is like the Virgin Mary ! UGOLINO Bring all your candles closer . Here is a sacred thing . He takes the crown.St . Helena , mother of Constantine , Dreamed where the true cross lay Hidden in Palestine , And found the cross and found the nails and thorns  --  And said : " A fitting reliquary shall be made , A Crown more precious Than any that has ever been . Fashion me one of gold and fine enamel And emeralds and chrysoprase and pearls And lapis-lazuli and malachite , And weld a nail therein And set a splinter of the cross And set a thorn amidst its jewels , For it shall be the crown to rule the world . " Your scorn the world , Fiamma , I know . I know . O , yet be pitiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The WOMEN with the candles have formed a half circle of which FIAMMA is the centre . AMINA She is like the altar of Corpus Christi With all the candles burning . THE SOLDIER Not all the shrines of Rome have so much gold . MARIA I have seen a picture of the Virgin Mary . She was crowned Queen of Paradise by God . You have her look , Madonna . p. 54 UGOLINO I crown you  --  He falls to his knees.So  --  You shall be Queen beside me . And we shall rise omnipotent , we two  --  You  --  Fiamma  --  Ah ! And Ugolino , I ! He buries his face in the hem of her dress . Still she does not move . Her gaze seems frozen . All the lights shine upon her , but they are pale beside her . She is an image of the Virgin decked in votive offerings . She could work miracles . But this feeble , gorgeous , worldly attempt to enshrine divinity has failed . The singing has grown so loud that UGOLINO 'S words have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Madonna , he is come . CANETTO Who ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON The hermit . CANETTO So I remember now , You told me of this hermit , Captain . FIAMMA Still immovable , breaking her silence almost with an effort . Lead him before me . CANETTO Not so fast , Madonna . FIAMMA Bring him before me . UGOLINO Lifting his head. I 'll have no shavehead here . He supports himself at FIAMMA 'S feet , leaning upon his arm. p. 55 MARIA Madonna . oh , Madonna Fiamma no . CANETTO watches FIAMMA and MARIA closely . FIAMMA Bring him to me . But suddenly , DAMIANO is there . He enters quickly without being fetched , a stalwart figure in the robe of a Franciscan friar minor . His cowl is pulled far over his face . He moves with the swift swing of youthful energy . Seeing FIAMMA , he pauses . He eyes and FIAMMA 'S meet across the crouching form of UGOLINO . FIAMMA Leave us together , all of you . UGOLINO Looks at DAMIANO feverishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DAMIANO does not move.Answer me , priest who are you ? CANETTO Steps forward.The holy father enters as he pleases . I would I might make sure . He speaks half to himself and goes toward DAMIANO . He lifts his hand as though to snatch back the cowl . He changes his mind . He seems to radiate a great sudden joy and he is surely thinking deeply and quickly . Come leave Madonna here with her confessor . His arm about UGOLINO 'S shoulder , turns to FIAMMA . We shall , in turn , obey your wish , and go Regretfully , but with due reverence . p. 56 UGOLINO Puzzled looks at CANETTO.Why , no . CANETTO Master . UGOLINO No . No . CANETTO Master , be generous . My master ? His tone is curiously insinuating . UGOLINO Bursting out.He ? CANETTO We must be quite certain . UGOLINO , pushed by CANETTO , goes.Go on before , good Captain . The CAPTAIN goes , making the sign of the cross , as he turns toward DAMIANO . There 's piety , your Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Lovely Amina . Only leave your candles That the confession may not be too gloomy . AMINA goes , same business as the CAPTAIN , and the NUNCIO , with an adoring look at FIAMMA , follows . CANETTO My good Maria , I have need of you . War and religion Should not bear one another company Too long . So forward , men ! My good Maria . The soldier have gone . MARIA goes across , her fear quite evident . She is ushered out by CANETTO . Peace be upon your prayers . He goes . p. 57 FIAMMA She speaks as with a very great effort and she does not move . Put back your cowl . DAMIANO obeys . We see his face , of serious , quiet beauty , his hair dark and curly . A tight cap of mail rests upon his head . FIAMMA This is a strange disguise . This is a strange encounter . DAMIANO The hermit hooded me . FIAMMA God will forgive the desecration . DAMIANO I stared over the water at this place , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stare and lurk forever , so The hermit hooded me , and so , I entered You know why I have come ?

Could I have waited longer ? I knew he would be here.I knew that you would need me.All that I have called me.I answered.You were not frightened when they brought him here ? p. 58 FIAMMA At first , a little . After I remembered How you would surely come tonight . Are you alone ? DAMIANO Two score Lie off the island in a boat against The changing of the watch FIAMMA As I had planned . DAMIANO Enough ?

She makes a little plaintive sound , steps nearer DAMIANO and suddenly falls softly to her knees before him . His hands pressed tightly palm to palm , his lips move silently in prayer . FIAMMA My lord , my love , my guide , my master My husband and my brother before Christ My veriest child DAMIANO My Fiamma The night sky is luminous with moonrise . The upper reaches of the tower are all blue . He raises her to her feet and holds her at arms ' length , his hands on her shoulders , his face close to hers . My beloved , There is great danger Far less calm than she , he releases her and looks nervously about. p. 59 FIAMMA I have my love again ! DAMIANO That was Canetto ? FIAMMA Yes .

It shines through the window . FIAMMA Give me your lips , Damiano .

I do not know myself FIAMMA You tremble , my Damiano , and in me Is only blessed peace Give me your lips They kiss . p. 60 DAMIANO What sound was that ? FIAMMA No sound . DAMIANO I heard FIAMMA Only the sea birds nesting the tower . DAMIANO But if one should Come here upon us ! FIAMMA Maria keeps good watch . We are alone in a forgotten world . Not even God is here . The shadow of a head , shoulders and arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the man himself , in the frame of the tower window . DAMIANO The dew is fresh upon the April grasses , My Fiamma , in my heart . FIAMMA And I am filled and flowing with new life . DAMIANO This is incredible . We two , at last . And in this prison . FIAMMA ' T is a dream , perhaps . Damiano , I have dreamed A dreadful dream last night Came down upon my slumber , Came like a tapestry Woven of sword thrusts , Dyed in blood . Came down , Dark and interminable and enveloped me . Oh , dreams of mine , ineffable , remote , And bathed in bitter tears and crowned with thorns , And strewn with ashes , life has answered you ! DAMIANO Now in a little while We two shall give the signal with a torch , And then my men will come and we shall go , You , and our son and I , out of this place Into the garden of the day . I know that we are watched . p. 61 FIAMMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This the utmost moment of our lives . DAMIANO I heard FIAMMA Only the sea birds nesting in the tower . The shadow moves and vanishes.Come up and watch How well Fiorenzo sleeps . DAMIANO The moon has come and scattered all the mists Of evening . FIAMMA In my hair They linger still . DAMIANO The moon has spun Moon cobwebs in the wonder of your hair , There hangs an opal aureole of light Where the soft mesh of fog reflects the moon . They are on the stairs , embraced.The wind is in your hair . Ah , give it me , Its glory is God 's vision after death . Oh , let your hair breathe on me , Fiamma , so I hold it to my lips . They go on up the stair . FIAMMA Now all the woof of shadows vanishes . Now all the secrets of the silences , Like a thick skein of sombre colored silks , Limp i ' the hand , are ours . Unravel them , Weave them anew ! DAMIANO Together , Fiamma . FIAMMA Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeps . DAMIANO As he speaks the door , left , swings open quite silently and very slowly . Your body is like honey and like wine , Your voice Is like the echo when the starling sings , Your breath Is sweet as scent of clover fields Blown down the summer wind to nothingness . Your hair , oh , Fiamma , let your hair fall down On your slim bosom . On my lips , my soul Begs for its softness . The door is open now . FIAMMA Stops him with a gesture and turns to the shrine where it glows beside her door . Ave Maria gratia plena , ora pro nobis . She is interrupted by a scream from the outer darkness . It is the cry of a woman in mortal agony . It is repeated with choked , horrible words which we can not understand , which we guess to be pleas for mercy . FIAMMA and DAMIANO start apart in terror . The scream sounds nearer . MARIA enters . Her scream is choked in her throat as she crosses the threshold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither FIAMMA nor DAMIANO makes a sound . A very sickness of terror holds her clinging to the stair-rail He comes very cautiously toward the moaning figure of MARIA. p. 63 CANETTO Some chords of a lute off stage and he is heard singing merrily . The voice comes from a distance . E lo mio cor s'inchina , O , bella , vo dicando Cos cos . Com'io mi sento E di dolor penando , E vi e vi e vivo in gran tormento . DAMIANO Bending over the prostrate woman , he speaks through the song . Maria ! My good Maria ! What have they done to you ? He lifts her head . FIAMMA runs to him , but the sight of MARIA 'S face halts her . DAMIANO Her tongue ! Torn out at the roots ! FIAMMA Her cry of horror breaks into the singing.The butchers ! DAMIANO Canetto ! Our messenger She will not speak again . Such a jest As hatches in that evil mind They know me who I am . FIAMMA Oh , now the thing begins . Canetto sings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juggler . We are the balls he tosses in the air . He tosses us and holds us in his hands ! The curtain falls upon their terror. @x The curtain rises again as soon as may be . The scene and situation are unchanged . The action has not been interrupted . CANETTO Still singing in the distance.Oim ch'io moroe amando ! Oim oim oim la donna mia ! Oim la vita mia ! Pr'amo vo sospirandoPer ti per ti per ti , o vita mia , Aim aim aim ! E mors querando . DAMIANO We shall have need Of all our wits . FIAMMA This is to make folk laugh . Fool ! Fool that I am ! DAMIANO This thing lies between him and God . FIAMMA Between Canetto and his god ? DAMIANO They tortured her . What did she tell ? What did she tell them ? CANETTO Still singing in the distance.Pi ch'a donna che siaA ti a ti a ti mi raccomandoOim lasso , pensando ; E di e di e dico , o perla mia , E lo mio cor s'inchina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only make a choked and inarticulate sound. p. 65 FIAMMA She stops MARIA with a gesture of horror.Someone is coming . Cover your head . DAMIANO quickly pulls the cowl over his head . The CAPTAIN enters . FIAMMA Oh , Captain , see . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON She told Nothing . FIAMMA My brave Maria . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON It was her silence angered them . I greatly fear for you , Messire Damiano . FIAMMA You know ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I guessed . FIAMMA And yet admitted him ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON To you , Madonna . DAMIANO We must move hastily . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Which way ? DAMIANO There is the window , We have a ladder . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON They have their crossbows and the moon is full . FIAMMA Canetto knew What power Fiorenzo had . DAMIANO The child was certain bait . p. 66 FIAMMA Three rats ! The trap is full ! THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I am the Captain here , I still control who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON To save you from disaster , Madonna Fiamma , I would betray this garrison . My Lord , I understand How few things are important in this life , How there may be but one . FIAMMA And that one ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Justice . FIAMMA Oh , yes . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON You have concealed In boats beneath the rocks Two score of soldiers , sir . DAMIANO Canetto knows ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I can not say . I know . So hide , Messire Damiano . FIAMMA My chamber . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Better not . Their thoughts Race to your chamber . Ugolino grows Amorous in his wine . FIAMMA Her hands cover her eyes.Ah ! THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON He has opened the trap which CANETTO inspected in the opening scene . Go down , Damiano. p. 67 DAMIANO And leave you , Fiamma ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Trust me . Who trusts no man is lost indeed . DAMIANO I shall be trapped . FIAMMA The trap is sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messire Damiano . DAMIANO I had rather Fight in the open . FIAMMA Think Fiorenzo lies Completely at their mercy . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Only this Between your deaths and you . That I command the gates . DAMIANO You swear to open them ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON If need come yes . DAMIANO In God 's sight , then , whose eyes Can not be blinded . DAMIANO goes down into the place beneath . The CAPTAIN closes the door above his head . FIAMMA Now I commend myself to God and you . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON His safety lies in your two hands . FIAMMA I know tonight can not miscarry , Tomorrow were too dreadful otherwise . p. 68 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Be gentle , brave and wise , And ' ware Canetto . Where shall I take the woman ? FIAMMA Is she much hurt ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Not mortally . FIAMMA Poor woman ! Captain , such fidelity Is something more than ordinary . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Oh , rare is all fidelity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my oath . My fealty that men would call my honor . Serving injustice , would God call it so ? FIAMMA Fidelity Can not be base nor to base ends perverted . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Ah . FIAMMA My state is pitiable . Do what you may For me and for my lord and for my child . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Great soul . Forever more I swear . But CANETTO enters suddenly bearing his lute . CANETTO You must not whisper , Captain . Whispers strike The spark upon the tinder of suspicion . Besides I find it difficult to overhear you . FIAMMA Pointing to MARIA.Messire Canetto , This is a hellish thing that you have done . p. 69 CANETTO Madonna Fiamma , This is a thing too hideous for hell . FIAMMA To the Captain.Take her away . CANETTO Go , help her to the woman 's lodgings . Send the leech to her That she may learn to speak without a tongue . FIAMMA Oh , can you walk , Maria ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Well enough If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her moans have ceased . MARIA looks once and terribly at CANETTO . CANETTO shudders in spite of himself . The CAPTAIN and MARIA go . FIAMMA I heard you singing now , Messire Canetto , Upon the heels of this . CANETTO He hums mockingly . " E lo mio cor s'inchina " Madonna While duty robbed me of the sight of you , Which was a deep misfortune to my eyes , I thought to give you sound of me , and took Such comfort in my madrigal . FIAMMA The crow caws horrid requiems . CANETTO Look in my eyes . What glint of infamy do you discover ? My nails shall pluck it out . FIAMMA I am not in the jesting vein . p. 70 CANETTO But he is gay enough for both.If rain falls from the thunders of the skies Upon two men alike , two men are wet . But only one of them may dry himself Beside the fire . FIAMMA Both . CANETTO Alas , We are not Moslems when the fire is love . FIAMMA Oh , villain ! CANETTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vile ! CANETTO The trap must work Two ways at once . My master gains His vengeance . I appropriate his love . Is not the division fair enough ? Where have you hidden him ? He looks about . FIAMMA Whom do you think I hide ? CANETTO The man of God . FIAMMA Gone ! I had almost forgotten him in this . I can not much regret He did not stay to share it with me . CANETTO He did not stay ? FIAMMA You see he did not . CANETTO And now , beyond a doubt , he tells his beads Peaceably in his chapel ? FIAMMA It may be so . p. 71 CANETTO The age of miracles goes on and on . How did he leave ? FIAMMA How ? CANETTO By the window ? FIAMMA That way is guarded . Ask the sentinel . CANETTO So opportune in his arrival So early gone . FIAMMA I am not slow at my devotions . CANETTO Who has no fear of hell has little need Of prayer , Madonna that I concede . Only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , who wore A shirt of mail . FIAMMA Are you surprised ? It seems a prudent garment . CANETTO Against swords , perhaps . Against suspicion , most imprudent . But  --   --  My preference impels me to believe Your words although I know there is no truth In them . FIAMMA I do not ask that you believe my words . CANETTO It suits me for the moment . FIAMMA Search as you will . CANETTO No , I 'll rather close This door and speak with you a while In privacy . FIAMMA You have much jarred my gaiety. p. 72 CANETTO Unfortunate ! My own Is at the fever pitch . He goes to close the door . FIAMMA Leave me . CANETTO There 's a feast , tonight . My lord calls it his wedding feast . Your eyes are wary , Fiamma . Should you laugh Were I to woo you ? FIAMMA Are you so disposed ? CANETTO Love is an element In all our dispositions . Am I rash ? FIAMMA Since you risk nothing , only base . CANETTO I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a scorn but little less than friendly . A curse from you were cousin to a blessing . I told you , you remember , I found in you my first antagonist ? I am a judge , Madonna . FIAMMA I find your words discourteous . CANETTO Alas ! FIAMMA You find my scorn is something less than friendly , I find your thoughts much less than loyal , if , I have culled their flower . CANETTO You find the flower Fragrant ? FIAMMA No . CANETTO Why , then . Endow it with a perfume . p. 73 FIAMMA I ? CANETTO Who else ? Lady , I love you , too . FIAMMA Even as I said Your loyalty Might well be questioned . CANETTO My loyalty to whom ? FIAMMA Your master . CANETTO I am not slow to change A master for a mistress I offer you the choice Between that German swine I serve , and me , Who am , I think , the more presentable Considered as a lover . There is a bond between us two . FIAMMA What bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANETTO Or good or evil Beauty is beauty still . Beauty with me or corn husks with a swine . Say do you know remorse ? Delicately considered , it becomes A kind of revelling in wrong . I know What I shall do . Now , through remorse , I glory in the doing . My pulses pound the harder . Love is made , Somehow , more resonant by this remorse Of mine , this honest consciousness of what I do for you against my loyalty . All my life is here ! Since you will make no choice Between my lord and me , I fling my loyalty at your feet , Trample its flimsy texture , Vault the gulf between us , take you for myself And laugh at him ! p. 74 FIAMMA I 'll call your master here . CANETTO How if I call him ? FIAMMA You will not dare CANETTO Not dare , and this to gain ? FIAMMA I am still Fiamma CANETTO Ay , that 's true . See , now I close the door . My master sits Over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon your dress . A little wrench . Only a little wrench He has suited action to word and stands , now , his hand gripping the bosom of Fiamma 's dress . FIAMMA In a hard voice.Put down your hand . CANETTO I can not . FIAMMA Put down your hand ! CANETTO Strike it away . FIAMMA A futile movement . Her hand falls.Ah ! CANETTO Madonna Fiamma I alone Of all who cross your path am strong enough To disregard your will . You dare not cry aloud for help , Because , to cry were to betray Damiano . You laugh ? p. 75 FIAMMA I do not laugh . CANETTO A little danger , like a little wine , Resolves our passions to consuming heat , Our blood to molten metal . FIAMMA Oh , my God , Resolve my indeterminate heart for me ! CANETTO Refuge in prayer ? Why , then , the trick is turned ! The molten metal 's poured upon the wood . It chars an instant more and it will burst To devastating flame . Call on Damiano And let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him from off your lips , And kiss the snarl of terror from your lips FIAMMA Talk and talk and talk hold off CANETTO Sea gull ! FIAMMA Back ! CANETTO Fox FIAMMA Wild beast CANETTO That 's it ! Wild beast ! I am Reynard come to mate With you beneath the moon I bark . I howl FIAMMA Now tell me you are mad Tell me that you are mad , or , by the saints , I 'll tear your soul out of your stinking throat . CANETTO Breaks out into convulsive laughter.Tear , Fiamma , tear , and see How my soul mirrors you in all your beauty . p. 76 FIAMMA Kneel down . CANETTO My queen . FIAMMA Kneel down And swear you did not speak to me . Oh , foul . CANETTO He kneels.Foul though I be , I woo you and , in time , Shall win you to my wooing . This I knew From my first glimpse of you FIAMMA Befouled Befouled am I in this You jackal of the night You snake . you wolf . CANETTO You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come against the table . With a swift gesture she whips Ugolino 's sword out of its scabbard and presses its point against CANETTO 'S throat . Silence ! CANETTO Still choked with laughter , on his knees , his hand catches her skirt to his lips . Magnificent ! Now , press ever so lightly A single blow and your worst enemy And hottest suitor dies . Oh , now again A thrill runs through your flesh as when I touched Your bosom lately . Oh , believe me , Fiamma , Such loathing is the closest kin to passion . Is , of itself , desire . She tries to draw back . His upturned face seems to hold her almost hypnotically . I see my lord Who kneels by your inviolable bed , Pleading , and is rejected , And turns away and dares not touch your hand , For utmost fear of you . I dare . Oh , Fiamma , do you see ? I dare . His hand has crept up the blade and fastens upon hers where she grips the hilt The sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be fit to father heroes . You No longer speak with men , but hold , at evening , Your solitude 's communion with the bells . FIAMMA reels . CANETTO begins to rise.For all and always , I , Madonna Fiamma , I have broken you In all the world I am your single peer . On his feet , facing her . I have decided , Fiamma , presently We shall go out together , to some hill , Where distant lutes are clear and night birds sing . I know this , Fiamma , nor will you gainsay My will in any wise . This love of mine Born in betrayal of my master 's trust , Envenomed by remorse , In its incredible ascendency , Is invincible . The sword falls clanking to the floor . Her hands are limp . FIAMMA catches her breath in a great sob.Said I not so ? Oh , now oh , now , your flesh Is flame , your blood is molten gold , your bones Are nothing . His hands mould her as though she were clay . p. 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is Nothing , Madonna , so invincible As evil . FIAMMA Ah ! CANETTO It is the revelry Of life eternally triumphant , ah  --  It is the hunger of eternity . He sinks at her feet and his lips devour her hand . She seems completely bereft of strength . UGOLINO bursts in . UGOLINO Fiamma ! Without materially changing his position , CANETTO stiffens . FIAMMA 'S head falls back . She is revived . UGOLINO Madonna Fiamma ! FIAMMA My lord I welcome you CANETTO On bended knee , Madonna , I thank you UGOLINO Evidently he is a little drunk.I left a priest here . Where has he gone ? CANETTO He has vanished Like a coin flipped in the sea . He rises , his poise restored . UGOLINO To FIAMMA , angrily.You 've hidden him To CANETTOHer chamber ? p. 78 CANETTO His eyes and FIAMMA 'S meet.No I searched . UGOLINO Beneath here , then ? CANETTO I had not thought of that . UGOLINO I 'll look for him . Where is my sword ? The sword is still lying at FIAMMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword lie there ? You have been playing with my sword . CANETTO Was it play ? I scarcely know . Give me the weapon , Master . Let me search . He looks again at FIAMMA as he opens the trap.Have I your leave , Madonna ? FIAMMA You will find nothing CANETTO Mockingly.I will find  --  nothing He goes down , the naked sword in his hand . UGOLINO To FIAMMA.Where are your lips ? Where is their blood ? The texture of your cheeks Is changed to whiteness like the foam . FIAMMA The foam Of waters churned and beaten against the rocks UGOLINO Swear you have not seen Damiano in this place ? I love you so . Do not betray my love . p. 79 FIAMMA My lord . UGOLINO Not to my enemy . FIAMMA Release me . UGOLINO No No and no ! This monk Was not his messenger ? Swear , Fiamma ! FIAMMA I swear that . UGOLINO makes to go toward the opening of the trap . You heard The answer I returned his Holiness ? UGOLINO Oh , Fiamma ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do . UGOLINO I know that I am mad . You madden me . If he were here if he were here ah , God ! FIAMMA What empty words ! UGOLINO You ghoul you saint Or he or I ? Fiamma , where is he ? FIAMMA Who ? UGOLINO Damiano ! Damiano ! FIAMMA Do I know ? UGOLINO Damnation ! You lie to me you lie FIAMMA I swear . p. 80 UGOLINO No No . You lie to me . With his clenched fists he threatens her . She stands unmoved . CANETTO She does not lie , Master . He emerges at this moment.I have found no one . UGOLINO Breaking again. Oh , forgive me , Fiamma . His head falls . He brushes his hand across his brow as though to clear his mind . He moves listlessly away . Presently he sees the arras behind which he and CANETTO hid in the opening scene . His suspicion aroused , he looks behind it . He goes searching about . CANETTO Madonna , see The blade is clean There is no blood upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some sign to DAMIANO . CANETTO stops her.Leave him in hiding , Fiamma . The moment for your rescue has not come . He closes the trap . FIAMMA Silence . CANETTO Can not you thank me ? FIAMMA Thinking on all that hangs , between us , sir , I can not find it in my heart to thank you . p. 81 CANETTO It is enough for me to realize Some little obligation on your part . UGOLINO Drunken murmurings as he searches.Where has he gone ? FIAMMA Is that your Christian purpose ? Look to your master . UGOLINO Behind the arras ? Shavecrown , come out . CANETTO Is it not terrible to drink As Germans do ? UGOLINO Comes down from the back where he has been pulling the arras about . He tears open his doublet , so that his throat is bared . The wine befogs my sight . I can not see My bride . He paws his throat.Oof ! I am better , so . Bring in the feast . Invite The Captain of the Garrison . Music ! He stares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my good master . UGOLINO What were we looking for ? CANETTO Eh , Master ? UGOLINO Was there not a priest about ? CANETTO He 's gone . UGOLINO Fetch me another one . What 's a wedding without a priest ? p. 82 CANETTO Good master ! UGOLINO Why not , why not ? Now I 'll have wine and lights and lights and wine . Call out , Canetto ! Bid them come to serve My bride and me ! Music ! Off stage the sound of a lute tuning and almost at once the music begins . A lute and a viola . And AMINA enters with dishes . Other servants follow . CANETTO superintends the laying of the table , always with an eye upon his master . Torches are brought and set in brackets . CANETTO Master , your dress . UGOLINO Let be . It 's better so . The room is warm . He is leading FIAMMA to her place.Tonight Is my last night in Italy . To horse Tomorrow , and the windy road and swords , Maybe , Madonna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halts him. I know , yet , in the end of judgment , grant That to my life a single beauty came With love of you . He breaks down on the verge of drunken tears . FIAMMA I pity you I pardon you . UGOLINO Pity me ? Pardon me ? Oh , saints of heaven ! Here 's a woman 's pride . FIAMMA No , Ugolino p. 83 UGOLINO The bully in full swing.Madonna Fiamma , I no longer fear you . Wine gives me courage . Throw back your head , and laugh Laugh merrily ! Where 's your robe ? Where 's your crown ? One of the servants makes to bring them to her from the corner where they have lain all this time . She waves him off , and CANETTO motions him to take them away . CANETTO Fills a glass with wine , lifts it , sardonically exultant . Le vin est bon et bel et blanc , Fort et fer et fin et franc , Freit et fres et fourmijant ! UGOLINO That song is French ! CANETTO Burgundian . Three B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make wine Worth drinking . Shall I do a trick For you , my Master ? UGOLINO Look on him , Fiamma , look , Is he not wise and merry ? When I am Emperor of Germany I 'll name Canetto Chancellor . CANETTO Oh , Master He bows and goes up the stairs to FIAMMA 'S room . UGOLINO Fiamma , pour wine for me ! Pour wine for me no , you you are my bride . I 'll have you serve me. p. 84 FIAMMA To your shame , Ser Ugolino , to your sin and shame . UGOLINO Sweeping gesture , drunken and imperious , as he sits beside the woman . All of you turn Your faces to the wall . I love you , Fiamma , I must tell you so I shall lie by you in your tomb , at least , If not in life . FIAMMA If you can face my hatred down . UGOLINO Or love or hate , Tonight is mine tomorrow shall be mine And ever after to the well of death Now , bring the dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He comes toward the table and lays his hand on his sword involuntarily . At the same moment , CANETTO , who has run up the stairs to FIAMMA 'S chamber , reappears with FIORENZO , frightened , upon his shoulders . The CAPTAIN , seeing him , halts . FIORENZO Mother ! FIAMMA She turns and sees him . Furiously , first to UGOLINO , then to CANETTO . Madman , oh , madman , do you think to teach Me fear of you in this wise ? I will play At any game with you Knowing I can not lose Where all is lost already and long since FIORENZO hides his face in FIAMMA 'S dress . p. 85 UGOLINO Long live my bride who learns last to fear Her master . My good Captain , You are come tardily Be welcome , none the less Cry out " Long live the bride of Ugolino ! " THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON He takes his place at table . Oh , long live Madonna Fiamma ! CANETTO I cry it , also Madonna Fiamma ! UGOLINO Empress of Germany , tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . Her face is framed by the glimmering tapers . She remains silent and motionless . Gradually her gaze becomes more and more intense and her face lights with a great ecstasy . In the meantime the feast is under way . The music continues , the stew and wine are served . Soldiers stand about with torches . UGOLINO Canetto , she 's gloomy CANETTO Gloomy or gay , she 's beautiful . UGOLINO Rejoice with me Fiamma , rejoice Oh , do you think she hates me so ? CANETTO I think she loves you , sir , the best of us . UGOLINO What song was that , Canetto ? CANETTO Le vin est bon et bel et blanc Freit et fer et fourmijant. p. 86 UGOLINO Captain , you 're not drinking !

THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Better bring God to filth than filth to God . UGOLINO Who speaks of filth ? FIAMMA Oh , see ! A vision comes upon my eyes a gate Shining above the inevitable sea , That is the floor of heaven , That is the wilderness of earth I have seen the heavens , The everlasting heavens , I have looked into the radiant hostelry Where sits the Lord upon his burnished throne . His shoulders are so broad p. 87 UGOLINO Give me your throat to kiss . FIAMMA His eyes look kindly at me and he speaks Saying , " Whatever men may be I am the truth , I am belief , I am love I am perfect justice , I am the perfection of knowledge . " Wherefore I know that I Must have no terror more . CANETTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great soul !

CANETTO Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules us no less , For all our wisdom , and we go , at last , Down to defeat , at fate 's decree , and there , From knowing God , find truth , upon The uttermost foundation stones and learn The honesty and beauty of our souls . What does it matter how the world is lost ? UGOLINO I had a wench before was given to visions FIAMMA From far above them.What does it matter how the world is lost ? We four are here assembled at a feast Of life . This wine , this meat , these breads , these fruits Are things inanimate , transmuted here By the stupendous tension of this hour These are our very souls we eat and drink What does it matter how the world is lost ? p. 89 CANETTO A hoarse echo.What does it matter how the world is lost ?

A great shout from the sea . p. 99 CANETTO Calls out behind and below.Madonna Fiamma Madonna Fiamma Here 's for your arsenal ! A sword is flung in the door and falls clattering on the stage . FIAMMA Falls upon it , crying out in terrible agony.Damiano ! Damiano ! FIORENZO I am frightened , Mother Mother , what is that sword ? Mother FIAMMA Struggles to her knees and prays frantically .

UGOLINO drops upon his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANETTO Do not forget me in your prayers , Madonna , There is no single soul in all the world Has such a need as mine of intercession .

I did not kill Damiano. p. 100 FIAMMA Ah ! She rises to her feet and faces him . CANETTO His Moorish mail was strong Your prayers were strong , Madonna . FIAMMA Oh , blessed Virgin !

The sound of shuffling feet in the passage off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden . CANETTO Well , we shall see . Here is your husband , Fiamma , My captive for the moments that are left Upon his dial of life . As he speaks , four soldiers enter carrying between them the dripping form of DAMIANO lashed upon a rough bench . He is not quite unconscious . He blows salt water bubbles when he breathes . How comical a tragedy ! FIAMMA bends silently over him.Fiamma , I pity you , you did not know What power opposed you . He is not sorely wounded . He will revive . p. 101 FIAMMA And afterwards ? CANETTO Who knows ? FIAMMA He will be killed ? CANETTO What else ? FIAMMA And by what means ? CANETTO Smiles.Here 's deep revenge exacted and between This present and the aftermath of death Exaction must be perfect . We shall determine on the means , My master and myself .

DAMIANO My love FIAMMA We two have loved . That is the link between God and ourselves . You see , Damiano , what an empty thing is death . Only our houses that we leave behind Are dead There but the wind speaks in the empty rooms , There but the wind walks on the empty stairs , Emptiness there . But we ! How splendidly We two stand in the light , Together ! p. 102 DAMIANO I have fought always . I could wish That I had died in this immediately FIAMMA A song , a laugh , a sob and darkness after And then the sun again forevermore . DAMIANO I , in the fullest blooming of my summer , Must gravely laugh and go to the supreme , Making no question and no argument . What will become of you ? FIAMMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , you will not leave me here ? FIAMMA Oh , no , Fiorenzo ! DAMIANO What of Fiorenzo ?

He falls back . CANETTO Bring in the other . He speaks to a soldier who appears in the doorway . Two more soldiers appear . These corpses He indicates the dead bodies which still lie on the stage . Our little supper is not eaten yet To a soldier who is not carrying out the dead.Set this to rights . The soldier proceeds to restore the table , etc.The wine is not yet drunk that we would drink . Master , you must choose now . Shall it be vengeance , now ? Or love ? For the occasion offers either , Developed to a nicety so subtle It were a pity to confuse the two . p. 103 UGOLINO What is the end ? CANETTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . UGOLINO Get quickly there . CANETTO In time  --  in time , good master Once you have made your choice Between your vengeance and your love . UGOLINO I will not choose . CANETTO You must choose one . You must give one or the other . A look of fury from UGOLINO.I have served you well tonight . UGOLINO Give me the woman , then . CANETTO A long , bitter look at her.Beside my master , Fiamma ! UGOLINO A cry of almost boyish despair.Fiamma ! My Fiamma that I hate and love So wretchedly to my defeat , relent ! CANETTO So ! Tonight 's an orgy , now . I 'll suck the occasion dry of what it holds I have not yet begun Here is the man she loves , here is the child . Since I have lost her love for me , I wreck My will upon her love for them and find Such satisfaction as I may . He throws himself upon the stool whereon he sat before . Where is my page ?

The child is hungry . He tosses a scrap of meat to FIORENZO.Here 's for your appetite ! FIAMMA Snatching FIORENZO to her. No ! CANETTO He is my page who might have been a prince . DAMIANO Knave knave knave Struggles to break free . The guards hold him . FIAMMA God reckons with you ! Ugolino , You will not tolerate this horrid business ? UGOLINO This sickens me , Canetto . A soldier enters leading the CAPTAIN . His hands are bound , his head is bloody . CANETTO Captain , you come in time . Your treachery Will presently be rewarded , But , for the moment , we resume our feast , Your seat awaits you . p. 105 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Madonna , I regret Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God be with you . FIAMMA bows her head . Now , except that the table is not lighted as before with candles , the composition of the picture is the same . The upper reaches of the tower are dark with the lustreless quality which precedes the dawn . Gradually a faint gray appears in the sky and the upper walls emerge . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Here are we four again and as we were At Fiamma 's feast of life That was illuminate with hope , That pulsed with sorrow Here are we four again , With fruits and breads and meats and wines No more transfigured into living things . The light of hope is gone from us Ashes , forevermore . CANETTO Captain , Are you prepared to die ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Better than you . CANETTO No doubt and far more like . FIAMMA Oh , God , I cry to you for justice ! CANETTO Cry ! ! ! There is no reason here . Only that I will glut My senses ' till , for weariness , They shrink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since for me Love is not possible , Give me your vengeance , rather ; let me teach You what delight there is in cruelty . Certainly I shall put Damiano To some insidious torture , Then I shall sleep . I 'm tired ! p. 106 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Canetto oh , Canetto . CANETTO The terrible jester is his element.Were I a-straddle of the pit of hell I should go on with this and drain my life Tonight of its sensation . I am goaded , Goad spur and whip a-gallop to the end ! A soldier enters in hasteWhat is this interruption ? THE SOLDIER Ser Canetto , Another messenger is come from Rome . CANETTO Rome ! Why do the crows flock here ? This is the second . THE SOLDIER Messire Canetto , here 's another matter . CANETTO They have their answer . THE SOLDIER No . CANETTO Say what you fear , You quavering fool ! THE SOLDIER The mainland is in arms , The boats are out . CANETTO Fishers and farmers ! THE SOLDIER The Pope has spoken . CANETTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon your head and Ugolino Is excommunicated. p. 107 CANETTO With a great shout of laughter.Master , the church has barred you from its shelter ! Up Master , up ! What 's this ? Asleep ? Oh , no ! And in your cups beneath This terrible arraignment ? How great the power of anathema , That all the blighting curses of the church Can not arouse one drunkard 's sleep ! Curse God and man and live forever more ! To the soldier.Go , man the gates again . Hold off the boats . Call Jacopone here to me oh Fashion me crosses , I will have three crosses , And set them on the battlements . The sun Shall find six fish eyes staring out to sea To greet his rising . Three carcasses , stiff in the morning wind . These traitors are the thieves , this child the savior Upon my Calvary . And , at their feet This weeping Magdalen who led Crusades . Get hence about my orders . Where 's Jacopone ? Life will have life , lust , lust and death Cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ! I love thee more than heaven . The soldier has gone . Only one remains . JACOPONE enters . Good Jacopone , it must be the rack . Our time is short . Take torches and go down . Carry Damiano after . FIAMMA Mercy mercy . CANETTO Will God be merciful to his way . p. 108 DAMIANO God keep you , Fiamma . FIAMMA Not alone I come Along with you . The trap has been opened and JACOPONE goes down . He illuminates torches below . The smoky red light shines up . DAMIANO As FIAMMA clings to him.Farewell . Down , take him down The soldiers take DAMIANO down into the pit . FIAMMA Have you no mercy ? CANETTO None FIAMMA No price ? CANETTO No price that you will pay . FIAMMA Oh , God ! CANETTO is beside himself . He rushes to the edge of the pit . Murderer murderer murderer ! CANETTO This is the festival of Lucifer ! FIAMMA Oh , now and in God 's name , Canetto ! CANETTO Lucifer ! Lucifer . A soldier appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harder . I can not hear him scream . THE SOLDIER Shouting.Messire Canetto ! CANETTO Pausing , exhausted. What ? THE SOLDIER Three galleys in the east Three galleys loom against the sky They come upon us . CANETTO The Pope in arms how soon ? THE SOLDIER An hour . CANETTO An hour That 's a year to me Harder . I can not hear him scream Go up and watch The soldier disappears . FIAMMA has snatched a knife from the table and leaps toward the trap where CANETTO stands . CANETTO Catching her. Oh , no FIAMMA Great God CANETTO Shouting down into the pit.Damiano , she would have killed you Mercifully . DAMIANO Fiamma FIORENZO , who has cowered terrified in the corner , suddenly flings himself kicking and screaming at CANETTO. p. 110 CANETTO Frees FIAMMA and seizes FIORENZO with a shout of triumph . Here is the proper end . Let be the father . From the pit the shouts of DAMIANO and JACOPONE 'S voice . The sound of a blow and DAMIANO 'S groan . A fall . CANETTO goes partly down . CANETTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only stunned . He 'll come around . CANETTO So then Put on the child . FIAMMA has stood very near CANETTO . Now she reaches toward him and grips his arm . He turns toward her and looks into her face . There is no mistaking what she means . He looks at her a breathless moment . An inaudible exclamation escapes his lips . Liberated by CANETTO , FIORENZO runs to the CAPTAIN . Horrified , the CAPTAIN rises from his seat . His arms envelop FIORENZO and press the child 's face against his body . CANETTO staggers back , shuddering . CANETTO Dizzily he brushes his hand across his mouth and eyes and then comes to himself . He goes to UGOLINO . Asleep ? p. 111 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Madonna Fiamma , No good is in this bargain . CANETTO Silence , old loon Madonna Fiamma , Upon what terms , precisely ? FIAMMA Those two go free , out of this place , with all Immediate haste . To safety . CANETTO And yourself ? What will you do ? FIAMMA What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANETTO Have you gone mad ? FIAMMA Oh , no . I pay your price . CANETTO You sober me . I do not buy . FIAMMA You must . My husband and my child . I give the rest Of me to you in payment . CANETTO Moved , probably for the first time in his life.What are you thinking , Fiamma ? I am a dog , a kennel is my lodging . FIAMMA My bargain stands unaltered . I am prepared to share your kennel with you , To sleep beside you in your mire , to eat Foul flesh with you . CANETTO No , Fiamma . FIAMMA An hour , a night , a lifetime , If they go free . I know you have no mercy . p. 112 THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON God ! FIAMMA I do not think God will condemn this act , But in some mystic way Find it acceptable . CANETTO You do this proudly . FIAMMA I am not ashamed . CANETTO In all my life I have not seen such courage . If I should die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I own to the temptation , but I resist . For all I said , my habits are too strong . I will not be a traitor to my lord And , lest you tempt me further , He calls down into the pit.Jacopone , Finish him . FIAMMA I think you love me . CANETTO Holding his hand out to JACOPONE in the pit.Oh , woman ! FIAMMA I think you love me . CANETTO Heaven and hell are very near akin , In you . FIAMMA Canetto . CANETTO Oh , well . He looks at the sleeping UGOLINO.I am as he at last . How will you do it ? FIAMMA As you please , once they are safe away . p. 113 CANETTO Calling down.Up , Jacopone . CANETTO and FIAMMA stare at one another , the pit between them . JACOPONE comes up . You , Captain , lend a hand . Unloose his bonds . JACOPONE slips the cords from the CAPTAIN 'S wrists.Bring up the man . The CAPTAIN and JACOPONE go down.Madonna , you are strangely calm . If I were one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life . FIAMMA shakes her head.Fiamma , I envy you . You are strong . The CAPTAIN and JACOPONE return carrying DAMIANO . FIAMMA He is not dead ? THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Not dead , but only stunned . FIAMMA Much better so . He would believe me traitor . Now lay him gently down . DAMIANO is placed on the bench . FIORENZO Oh , Mother FIAMMA Hush You must do as I tell you , now , Fiorenzo , And not be frightened You must protect your father Go with him And when you come to the good hermit 's cell , Say to the hermit I entrusted you To him , Fiorenzo , and remember me Always . She kisses him . The CAPTAIN makes to lift DAMIANO . She stops him . She turns to CANETTO . You will entrust them to the Captain ? p. 114 CANETTO No . FIAMMA It must be as I say . CANETTO Looks at her a moment , then shrugs his shoulders.Captain , you will go free upon this errand . There 's greater enterprise than punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesser 's sin . Convoy this load of carrion Over the water . FIAMMA Captain , you know I trust you . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON I know this is not lightly done . FIAMMA Stay on with them . THE CAPTAIN OF THE GARRISON Forever , if you bid me . FIAMMA And tell them how this was . CANETTO Go . FIAMMA She stops the CAPTAIN again. I will not speak with them , but only look , And swiftly pass . She looks on DAMIANO and on FIORENZO . Then she nods to the CAPTAIN . DAMIANO is carried out by the CAPTAIN , JACOPONE and another soldier . FIORENZO walks sturdily after them . A breath of childhood came against my breast . A kiss of childhood brushed across my lips . My breast is dry again , my lips are dry . The memory will vanish . CANETTO draws the emerald necklace forth and throws it over her head , holding it like a leash. p. 115 FIAMMA Canetto , grant my eyes A last unstained farewell . CANETTO Go up go up . FIAMMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After me All things go on . She ascends to the window.The stars are gone . I think That God was looking down upon this place And would not show his face to us , and , so , Extinguished them . CANETTO Awed.Who are you ? FIAMMA I am the blinded horse Discarded from the wars . I turn the heavy millstone of despair Round , round and round . CANETTO He is almost shaken.Afterwards , What will become of you ? I have an hour only . What will become of you afterwards ? FIAMMA I shall go up to heaven joyfully To guard these fortunate memories of mine Lest future circumstance bewilder them . As a white , soaring sea bird I shall go Into the singing , white eternities . Evidently the boat bearing its precious , tragic cargo has come into her sight . She leans far out of the window . Oh , you , Fiorenzo and Damiano , now farewell ! She has looked her fill . She comes brokenly down the steps to the centre and begins to climb the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as with an unearthly sense of power. p. 116 CANETTO If I should die in this ! He moves to follow her , but her glance halts him . She continues toward the shrine and makes the sign of the cross before it . She does not pray . When she turns toward him again , there is a smile of triumph on her face . Her voice rings out strongly . FIAMMA Come when you will . She goes into her room . CANETTO Ah ! He starts . He glances at UGOLINO . He laughs nervously . He hears the singing of the fishermen on the sea . He looks toward them . He listens to his master 's steady breathing . He shrugs his shoulders . He goes quickly to the stairs and mounts them . He stands a hesitant moment at the door of FIAMMA 'S room . He starts to come down . He returns and goes in . From the sea comes the sound of a sailor 's chantey . CHANTEY Strong is the heart of the Virgin , soft are her eyes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kindly and wise ! CHORUS Ohe ohe . CHANTEY Her dais of amber and silver shines in the skies ! CHORUS Ohe ohe . The chantey intoned rhythmically , the chorus shouted. p. 117 CHANTEY Man that is born of woman lives unashamed ! CHORUS Ohe ohe . CHANTEY Weakling is he and sinful , brute and untamed ! CHORUS Ohe ohe . CHANTEY But his soul is the soul of Mary the Virgin acclaimed ! JACOPONE enters during the chantey . He looks at UGOLINO who stirs uneasily . The castle is stirring again . A distant trumpet call , and a roll of drums . The clank of a chain as , perhaps , the portcullis is raised . A soldier comes in . THE SOLDIER Hi , Jacopone ! JACOPONE Shhh  --   --  THE SOLDIER Relief . Past time , you dolt . The fishers are abroad . JACOPONE I hear them . THE SOLDIER Sees UGOLINO.Eh , what ? Again ? She 's a cold mistress . Does he always sleep Out here ? JACOPONE Silence , you swine . THE SOLDIER He 's drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so would you . The things that I have seen this night and heard ! He goes out . A ray of the rising sun strikes the tower and comes down from above direct upon UGOLINO who stirs again . The soldier watches him for a few seconds . Then he sees the open trap , goes to it , looks down , closes it with a crash. p. 118 UGOLINO Canetto ! Canetto ! THE SOLDIER Not here , my lord . UGOLINO Befuddled still by wine.Where is he ? THE SOLDIER Could n't say . I 've been on guard all night . The galleys still hold off . UGOLINO It 's morning . THE SOLDIER Day . There 's matins ringing . The bells are audible once more . UGOLINO Then I 've been sleeping . Is there wine there ? He rises clumsily , not yet fully awake . The soldier pours him wine and goes . He drinks it , looks about him , remembers . Sees the closed trap and mutters , scratching his head . Ah , Fiamma . Canetto , where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this very moment MADDELENA , GIOVANNA and AMINA enter with their brooms and pails as though to clean the room . They stop at the door . MADDELENA Look at the master ! AMINA He has slept here again on the rushes . UGOLINO With a bellow of rage he catches up his sword where he had dropped it upon the table early in the act . Harlot , he 's in your chamber ! You 've got him in your chamber . He lurches toward the stairs and up them toward the door of FIAMMA 'S room . Off stage the sound of a faint babble of voices , very joyous and excited . As at the end of the first act , the burghers and women come from the village . The men are unarmed . The women carry palm leaves . They come quickly past the three servants and pause . They see UGOLINO. p. 119 GIOVANNA Crying out in terror.Oh , God , he 'll murder her ! UGOLINO Harlot ! He has reached the top of the stair and he pulls open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising sun bursts upon him . He staggers back . CANETTO 'S body has been huddled against the door on the inside . It falls out at his feet . A great wound in his throat shows us that he is dead . UGOLINO His sword falls from his hand onto the stage . He clutches the body and drags it down the stairs , gasping . Canetto . Dead , but still warm . Dead , but still warm . There 's blood upon him . What did he there ? Canetto , oh my brother , my Canetto ! The refrain of the chantey is fainter , but the matins bells have swelled jubilantly out . They seem to blend together in a hymn of triumph . So FIAMMA enters , as one who walks gloriously from light into music . Her hands reach out before her . Her face is upturned to the heavens . The look in her eyes and the smile of her lips is somehow celestial . She comes quite steadily down the stair and goes toward the door . She is conscious of nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOMAN As FIAMMA appears.Madonna Fiamma ! p. 120 A BURGHER You are saved , Madonna ! THE SOLDIER Madonna , you shall go free ! He speaks as he bursts through the door . The NUNCIO enters with other soldiers . He pauses at the sight of FIAMMA . A BURGHER She has killed Canetto . THE PAPAL NUNCIO Not she , but God She was God 's instrument . UGOLINO makes one motion toward the divine woman and shrinks back aghast against the wall . As she passes him , his eyes follow her . A WOMAN Madonna , you are saved ! Oh , Madonna ! The last words in complete awe . She sinks to her knees . All the others kneel . A radiance of light shines in through the door upon FIAMMA . The women kiss the hem of her dress . She is gone out through the door into the music . She will walk dry shod over the waters . A triumphant shout greets her.                    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
