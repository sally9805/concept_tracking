txt // the problem , which is demanding solution , different , due to the fact that it is undertaken in school , from what it would be were it to arise in life outside the schbol ? In other words is the problem presented for solution by schoolroom practice essentially different from that found in life outside the school ? If the solution is carried on in the same way in school then the problem has a " natural setting " even though it is being solved in school . The provision for the natural setting of the teaching situation is the distinct contribution of the project method . Without the natural setting there is no project . CHAPTER IV PROBLEMS AND PROJECTS I. THE NEED FOR MAKING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROJECT AND PROBLEM A CRITICAL study of the literature on the project method , as applied particularly to the teaching of the arts and sciences , shows that no clear-out distinction has as yet been made between theproject and the problem method of teaching . Woodhull , for instance , in a recent article discussing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be quite fair to interpret him as using the terms synonymously , for in comparing the project or problem with the topic it is clear that he used the terms interchangeably . Again in the same article he states : " The present need of the schools is for a large collection of sample projects , or problems which may be used in showing teachers in a given community how to devise and utilize projects adapted to different grade pupils in their own environment . " 1 // In continuing the discussion , Woodhull quotes the characterization of the project made by C. R. Mann , which , as stated before , may be considered to be a multi-problem . There is a tendency , too , on the part of some writers , to use an expression which will not make it necessary to separate clearly and distinctly the terms " project " and " problem . " The expression which is used is the " problem-project method of instruction . " Hosic uses the term " problem-project " to describe certain teaching situations which for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term " project " adequate if it were not so closely identified with certain shop and laboratory practices . The term " problem " he believes is inadequate because it suggests a purely intellectual process . The " problemproject " appears to be more satisfactory because this compounded term emphasizes both thinking and doing , and points to an objective result . The writer is in sympathy with Hosic 's effort to include in the concept " project " the idea of a problem . It is rather unfortunate , however , that this was done by the use of the term " problem-project " because of the usual confusion in the use of these two terms . Hosic does not confuse the meanings ; neither does he use them synonymously . The teaching situation which he describes as the problem-project is designated as the project by the writer . Hosic 's use of the term " problem " is identical with the writer 's , to be described later . // In a recent article on the problem and project method , H. G. Lull makes no effort to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , however , that Kilpatrick " holds that problem instruction is a special case of project instruction . " The following statement by Lull indicates that he recognizes some difference in meaning between the two concepts . " Alternative suggestions arise in the case of the probkm as to whether one means or another shall be chosen I o relieve a difficulty or to reach a definite end . Or it may be that the choice of an end is in doubt . In either case , there are perplexing difficulties , and before a choice can be safely made , there must be further investigation . Finally , at least a tentative choice is made of a certain line of procedure or of a certain end to work for , and the work proceeds on the basis of this choice until it is shown to be leading the wrong way . Again , the problem is predominately a matter of explanation or interpretation while the project is in the main a matter of planning to do something and doing it . " 1 Since there seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as interpreted by some of the leading advocates and writers on the project method , it will be necessary , for the sake of clarity , to set up definitions which may make it possible to distinguish these two terms . // II . DEFINITIONS OF PROBLEM AND PROJECT The definition of the problem as proposed by John Dewey is quite adequate : " Every conscious situation involving reflection presents a distinction between certain given conditions and something to be done with them ; the possibility of a change . This contrast and connection of the given and the possible confers a certain problematic , uncertain aspect upon those situations that evoke thought . There is an element , which may be slight or which may be intense , of perplexity , of difficulty , of confusion . The need of clearing up confusion , of straightening out an ambiguity , of overcoming an obstacle , of covering the gap between things as they are and as they may be when transformed , is in germ , a problem . " 1 The definition of the project which the writer proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again here in connection with its relation to the problem . The project as defined is a problematic act carried to completion in its natural setting . The term " problem " is largely " intellectualistic in its connotation " and if it were used exclusively it would have a tendency " to overemphasize the intellectualistic aspect of school work . " 2 The project , on the other hand , lays emphasis not only on the problematic situation but also on the act and on the possibility of // carrying it to completion . The project makes provision for the natural setting of the teaching unit . Without the natural setting there is no project . The problem setting may be artificial , that is , it may not approximate a life situation . The project is a normal life situation , or the problem in its natural setting . The foregoing view is indicated by Kilpatrick in the following statement . " It is at once evident that every problem which is accepted for prosecution in the sense that its solution is willed ex vi termini is a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but every project is not a problem ; the problem method accordingly becomes a special case ? a most important one , to be sure ? of the project . " 1 This same view of the project and problem is shared by Miss Krackowizer : " Children 's lives are full of activity . They are constantly carrying out projects and solving problems of their own . In the process of living they learn to think , because of the fact that in their activity they : ire most often carrying out a definite purpose ; that in order to do so they must weigh and judge among ideas and material details and select from among these the ones most pertinent to the fulfillment of their immediate end ; that in working out their definite purpose , they meet difficulties which need to be overcome before the desired end can be obtained . // " Since this is the method of procedure of a normal child or of any normal human being when under no constraint , the school should adopt it . Purposeful activity ' on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The teacher 's part is to guide towards such purposeful activities ' as will prove of greatest benefit to the children , choosing among those directly available for first-hand experience . " 1 The following definition of the project is proposed by Miss Krackowizer : " Any purposeful activity ' determined upon and carried to a successful conclusion becomes a project . " She defines the problem as the situation which demands the " exercise of choice . " The writer uses the expression " natural setting for the problem " in the same sense that Kilpatrick uses " real problem . " In the writer 's definition of project the term is made to include the problem stated as the problematic act . It is quite clear , then , that the project must include a problem . The apparent difficulty in defining the fields of the project and problem is just what might be expected when the less inclusive term , " problem , " covers a large part of the field taken by the more inclusive term , " project . " The problem does not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the project does . To make a sharper distinction , we may state that the project differs from the // problem , in that it involves action in its natural setting . The project carries with it the implication of doing , the problem suggests primarily an intellectual process . The distinction between problems and projects is well stated by Miss Krackowizer : " The progress of carrying out projects and problems includes thoughts , suggestions and activities rejected as well as those finally selected as pertinent . If no steps are taken toward the attainment of a definite purpose , the mental problem may remain in the child 's mind , but there is no solution of it and there is no project involved . " 1 III . TYPES OF PROBLEMS AND PROJECTS ( a ) The Manual Problem and the Manual Project It should be remembered , however , that the problem is not necessarily confined to the intellectual process . It is quite possible to have problems involving manipulative skill , even physical activity , and yet these may not be considered projects . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking powder in a chemistry class , the teacher had the students make tests to determine the amount of carbon dioxide given off by equal amounts of the different brands of baking powder . The whole lesson proved // interesting and the results were probably better than those of the average laboratory experiment . The students carried out their problems and later purchased different brands to repeat the experiment . But while this exercise may have been effective , it was a problem ( we could well term it a manual problem ) and not a project , since the setting was artificial . One of the boys , however , suggested that it might be interesting to determine which brands were economical . Several of the boys and girls then tested the baking powder used at home and compared results with those obtained in the experiment . They then reported to their mothers the efficiency of the different powders and this resulted , in some cases , in a change by the mother in her purchase . This latter exercise is a project , for it arose in the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice to the mother , and the act was carried to completion in its natural setting . This may be termed a manual project . The manual projects are common in the fields of general science , agriculture , home economics , and manual training . ( b ) The Intellectual Problem and the Intellectual Project Again , it is not necessary that there be physical activity in the project , that is manual activity . While it is true that physical activity is usually considered a part of the project , yet mental acts may constitute " activity . " In a course in the " History of Western // Europe " the teacher suggested that the events of the Great War should be followed . One student noted in his reading the frequent references to the proposed reestablishment of Poland as an independent nation . He asked the teacher , " Why should this particular country be set up ? " The teacher replied that this would be a good problem for him to solve . As a result he read widely , looked up references , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Poland . This problem arose in its natural setting ? the situation was not essentially different because it was solved in school ; it was a problematic act carried to completion in its natural setting . This may be termed an intellectual project . ( c ) Illustrations Four types of projects and problems have been mentioned , the manual problem , the intellectual problem , the manual project , and the intellectual project . An illustration of each of these types will be made from the same field of subject matter in order to show clearly their differences . The subject matter may be centered around the study of the electric bell . If the topic were begun by making an assignment in the text , the student being required to master the lesson as assigned without regard to the natural setting for the problem , it would be an intellectual problem . If he were to perform the experi100 THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING ments as outlined and directed in the physics manual , even doing some construction work , this exercise would be classed as a manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are solved . They are not " projects " because the " natural setting " is lacking . The student might become interested in electric bells , burglar alarms , and the like , and take up the subject seriously , reading widely in order to familiarize himself with the details of the bell . He might do this in the same way and for the same purpose as one would who should consider such a problem outside the school . The teacher might set the stage for such purposeful activities . This method of approach illustrates the intellectual project . If this exercise were carried to the point where a bell system or a burglar alarm system was installed , perhaps in the home , the total activity would represent the manual project . These are projects because difficulties arise and are solved in a natural setting ; that is , the situation is not essentially different from a " life situation . " The two types of projects are recognized by Miss Krackowizer in the following quotation : " There are various types of projects . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material and without the necessity of outward expression ; this is the problem type . It goes without saying that , while this type may exist by itself , it is not likely to do so in the child 's world . On the other // hand , all other types of projects include the problem type in so far as they are not merely unconscious responses . " i It must be borne in mind that the manual problem and the intellectual project are the two concepts which may cause confusion in making the distinction between projects and problems . The first step is to determine whether the natural setting for the problem exists . If so , the teaching situation is a project . What is frequently done in school is to take problems away from their setting in projects , with the resulting tendency to teach them in isolated groups with little thought of their function . To avoid this isolation of elements , a larger unit of work , the project , is undertaken on a functional basis and carried over into activity . It is interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degrees of complexity . The boy who oils a bearing or the boy who determines the efficiency of the dairy herd is , in each case , carrying out a project , but the complexity of the latter is far greater than that of the former . Again the problems vary in complexity . For instance , the finding of the product of 3X 6 is less complex than the determination of the relative superiority of the harbors of New York and San Francisco . Krackowizer , Alice M. , " Projects in the Primary Grades , " p. 16. // IV . CLASSIFICATION OF PROBLEMS AND PROJECTS BASED UPON DEGREE OF COMPLEXITY Since there is such a wide variation in the complexity of the problems and the projects and since there are so many situations which these concepts cover , the following subdivisions indicating this degree of complexity are suggested : Problems may be classified as ( a ) Simple problems and ( b ) Multi-problems . Projects may be classified as ( c ) Simple , and ( d ) Complex . ( 1 ) Simple Problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many intellectual difficulties that are not complex and yet need to be solved . The teacher may ask such questions as , " Where is Louisiana ? What city is its capital ? Its resources ? Where is Alabama ? Its capital ? " etc . The teacher may ask a number of simple questions concerning the states in the Southern group , and since they are in a sense difficulties proposed for solution , they may be considered as simple problems . But , instead of proposing for solution a number of these simpler questions , the teacher may propose one large problem , which we call the multi-problem , and which may embrace all these simple problems . Instead of asking many detailed questions about the New England States and the Southern States a " multiproblem " might be suggested such as the following : // Compare the two groups of states in respect to size , location , surface , population , industries , harbors , agricultural activities , and labor . Or again , ? Is the Southern group sufficiently large to make a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Multi-problems and Illustrations There are many simple problems that could be proposed for solution in the suggested study of the two groups of states . But in the multi-problem attack , some one complex problem which will involve most of the materials and facts covered by the simple problem is selected . For instance , a superintendent proposed in the geography classes which were studying New England this question : " Might New England have developed into a powerful , independent nation ? " Several problems arose and all the facts usually taken up by the t opical method were utilized . The first minor problem was this : " Is New England large enough ? " A pupil turned to the appendix of the geography , found the area of the United States , of his native state , and of New England , and decided in the negative , ? New England was too small . " But how does it compare in size with some great European nations ? " was the question proposed by the teacher . The children named several important European countries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Comparisons of area were made . // The teacher then put the problem : " As far as area is concerned , might New England have been a nation ? Is New England large enough to become a nation ? " The class then reversed itself and decided for the affirmative . Then the question was put : " Greenland is twelve times the size of New England . Is it a great nation ? " The pupils decided that size was not all-important and that they must know whether or not the people could raise what they needed to eat , and to know this they must get facts about soil , seasons , surface , and climate . A study of soils was made and a study of the other items of seasons , surface , and climate followed . Before the books were opened , the children were always asked to hazard opinions about the probable nature of soils , seasons , etc . ( This took much time because of comparisons made with their native state . ) They decided that New England could not feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England could not clothe itself . It , therefore , could not become a great nation ? so the pupils reasoned . " But can England feed and clothe itself ? " The study revealed that it could not . " But since she is a great nation , how is this overcome ? " By trade . " What could New England trade ( from your knowledge of New England already learned ) ? " Products of fisheries , mines , forests , etc . " Does New England have more fish than it needs for its own use ? " A study of fisheries followed and the question was answered affirmatively . So , also , was carried on a careful study of mining , lumber-manufacturing , etc . In each case the children formed their judgment and verified their conclusions . ' // A Multi-problem in Art Another multi-problem , one in the field of art , may be cited . It was outlined and carried out in the seventh and eighth grades in Grand Rapids under the supervision of Miss Charlotte Calkins . The topic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful . " The problem took up all phases of making the house beautiful , ? the selection of the lot , making plans of the house , involving the principles of design , and finally the study and selection of furnishings . In the two years during which this study was carried on the pupils were brought in contact with most of the problems that arise in making the house beautiful . It may be said , parenthetically , that for most of the pupils this was a school problem , but to some of the pupils it became a project . One such project was called to the attention of the writer . A girl 's mother was planning to redecorate and refurnish the house . The girl , aided by the supervisor , took charge of the undertaking , and , in carrying the task to completion , developed principles as she needed them . This is , of course , splendid teaching , for it applies principles of art in a very concrete , interesting , and almost spectacular manner . The work as carried on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of asking the pupils to solve many detailed and simple problems of art , the large multi-problem , " The House Beautiful , " was suggested . There were many simple // problems and projects involved in this one large multiproblem . It is classed as a problem because it was not in most cases carried to completion in its natural setting . A Multi-problem in Arithmetic Another interesting multi-problem in the field of arithmetic is reported by Clark as an illustration of the project or problem-project . The problem was the mathematics and business practice involved in buying a lot and building a house . Such subjects as legal descriptions of real estate , taxes , building costs of different materials , borrowing money , mortgages , insurance , were studied in connection with the many mathematical problems . This is an interesting method of approach but should not be called a project or a problem-project because the setting is not natural , there is an artificiality about it . This is a valuable exercise and should be given wide publicity . For the sake of clearness , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A Multi-problem in Geography A significant multi-problem in geography was carried on by Miss Williams in an eighth grade at the Kansas State Normal School . The problem was " To show why the trade of New York is greater than that of San Francisco . " The problem was investigated by // all the pupils , each preparing an outline and suggesting methods of procedure . The things needed in solving the problems were suggested : " 1 . The value of trade in money and quantity of trade in tons . " 2 . Description of the two harbors. " 3 . Position of the two cities with reference to our country , to foreign countries . " 4 . Articles of trade . " The various points were discussed in class , references were reviewed , and finally a series of conclusions was prepared and adopted by the class . This is reported as a project-problem , but owing to the fact that there was no provision for the natural setting , it is more accurately classed as a multiproblem. ' ( b ) Simple and Complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in like manner there are simple and complex projects . The girl who accepts the problem of peeling potatoes economically at home may be said to be carrying out a simple project , but her task is much less complex than that of the girl who undertakes as her project the entire preparation of the meals for the family for a period of a month with par- // titular attention to the reduction of cost . The latter is a complex project . Obviously , it will be very difficult to draw an exact line of demarcation between the simple and complex problems and projects , but this guiding principle may be posited . When the process has sufficient complexity to be broken up into a number of problems or simple projects , it may be classed as complex . The classification of projects into simple and complex is recognized by C. R. Allen : " Projects ' may include major and minor projects , the latter being a subdivision of the former . For example , a boy might undertake to raise an acre as corn as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preparation of the soil or the test of the seed . " 1 In order that the proposed classification will be better understood , a number of simple and complex projects will be cited . ( 1 ) Simple Projects and Illustrations Such tasks as sharpening tools , cutting to a line , planing a board , and fitting a joint in the manual training class when carried on in a natural setting may be considered as simple projects . The baking of a loaf of bread , setting the table , serving the meal , and going // to the meat market to procure a certain cut of meat may be called simple projects in home economics . Making an analysis of soil , testing varieties of seed corn , spraying fruit trees with a given mixture , keeping a milk record for a week , selecting and preparing seed potatoes , developing plans to remove surface water around farm buildings , treating seeds with formalin , introducing a plan for proper feed rations for domestic animals , if carried on in the natural setting , are representative for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of design , making curtains , selecting artistic but inexpensive wall paper , illustrate the simple project . In composition , writing an invitation , a report of a recent athletic game for the school paper , or a letter illustrate the simple project in composition . In arithmetic , solving simple problems which arise in connection with some of the home activities , such as checking over the weekly grocery bill , illustrate the iiimple project . ( 2 ) Complex Projects and Illustrations A complex project differs from the simple project only in the degree of complexity . As stated previously it . is difficult to draw a sharp line between the simple project and the complex . To illustrate the point a little more fully , projects might be arranged in the order of complexity beginning with the least complex and ending with the most complex suited to school // conditions . The complex projects would consist of the projects in the upper half of this group . At the point in the scale where the projects were sufficiently complex to be broken up into smaller problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mark the beginning of complex projects . Complex Projects in Agriculture A number of projects outlined by Stimson in his bulletin on " The Massachusetts Home Project Plan of Vocational Agricultural Education " illustrate the complex project . The project of constructing a concrete walk might involve a study of the nature of cement ; its action on sand , gravel , and broken stone ; its weather-resisting qualities ; the seasons in which it might be used ; the cost as compared with plank , brick , flagging , and asphalt ; the mathematical determination of proportions of sand , cement , and stone to be used ; the geometrical determination of the sections into which it should be divided , and whether it should be crowned or flat ; the geographical sources of the raw material and the commercial conditions for purchasing the cement . " The home project , or part-time plan of instruction , moreover fits in nicely in its relation to the usual farm activities of the boy . The boy may help with the milking throughout his course , where the object is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no records are kept . During certain months of at // least one year the school should require whatever time may be necessary for keeping an accurate record in pounds and ounces of the yield of a part of the herd . This may be limited to the weighing of milk from a single cow and giving credit for what she produces . " 1 The complex project in agriculture is well illustrated by French under the name " long time projects . " 2 Such projects as raising an acre or more of corn , taking cliarge of an entire vegetable garden , or apple orchard , or the poultry for a season , give the scope of complex projects suggested by French . The student in a class in Modern History who became interested in the map of Europe and decided he would account for the present map undertook a complex project . A Complex Project Centering around the Parcel Post A very complex project centering around the parcel st , by C. W. Stone , will be summarized . It has been ' lioroughly developed and cuts across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a good example of the project worked out fully . Since the children plan at the holiday season to send packages to distant friends and relatives they naturally // consider the various ways by which they may be sent . This gives a natural motive for the study of the parcel post a few weeks before the holidays . This project was undertaken by the fourth grade class in the Iowa Teachers College Training School . " The main purpose was to bring the subject before the children in such a way as to prepare them to use the parcel post service to the best advantage . Accordingly , it was worked out not only through general discussions in which the entire grade took part , but also in their class work in handwork , geography , arithmetic , and language . " The available experience which the children had for this project was ability to read and write ; a knowledge of simple mathematics , including measurements , soiike knowledge of places in relation to their own locality ; ability to do elementary manual work ; they had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering packages . " The main aims which the teacher had in mind were ( 1 ) to teach the children how to wrap and address correctly packages to be sent by parcel post , ( 2 ) to teach them what might or might not be sent by parcel post , ( 3 ) to teach them the advantages of parcel post service , ( 4 ) to give them practical problems in arithmetic , ( 5 ) to make a beginning of map reading by locating the places to which packages were to be sent , ( 6 ) to give them a larger conception of civic life , ( 7 ) to train them in obedience to laws and regulations , and ( 8 ) to teach them to help other people . The rules and regulations of sending packages by parcel post were worked out by the pupils and teacher , the larger part was suggested by the pupils . The technique and practice of wrapping packages PROBLEMS AND PROJECTS 113 II was carried out in the handwork lesson . Here questions as to the cord and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of articles were developed . Each child selected an article and wrapped it , developing principles as needed . The addressing of the packages with its problems was done in the language class and the study of the parcel post zones was carried on in the geography class . In the arithmetic class the children were taught to weigh and compute the cost of sending their packages to different zones . After computing the cost , the packages were taken to the postmaster , each member in turn acting as postmaster , to purchase stamps . The postmaster then weighed the package , looked up the zone , computed the cost of sending the package , returning the change to the pupil . This work furnished material for practical problems in arithmetic . Some of the children actually sent packages which they had wrapped in class , thereby testing the results of this exercise . The package which furnished the greatest interest was the one prepared for an orphans ' home . The children brought toys from home and made others in the manual training class for the gift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and addressing constituted one class exercise . A letter written by one of the members of the class was included , requesting one of the children receiving the package to nswer . Since this letter was chosen as the best by a Committee it furnished competition , a motive , for the writing of the letter . " This study of the parcel post has given the children a practical knowledge which will enable them to render assistance at home whenever the need of sending // a package by parcel post may arise . It has been a socializing influence . It has made them more observant of civic relations and has opened their eyes to the possibility of their being able even as children to bring pleasure to others . The whole series of lessons furnishes a good example of the kind of school work which is a part of actual everyday living . " 1 A Complex Project in Physics In a high school physics course , the writer taught the principles and uses of the electric bell by the project method . Each year one or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely overhauled , which meant to install new bells , new wires , repair some of the bells , find short circuits , and , in many cases , make parts for bells or construct complete new ones . This project was discussed by the members of the class and leaders were appointed for each phase of the work . The principles of the electric bell were developed as needed in this task . Usually this experiment resulted in bell systems being placed in the homes . It will be seen that the complex projects proposed have been of sufficient complexity to allow them to be broken up into problems and simple projects . V. SUMMARY It may be restated that the project is a problematic act carried to completion in its natural setting . It // differs essentially from the problem in that it provides for the natural setting of the teaching unit and lays emphasis on the manual act . Problems may be classified as ( 1 ) intellectual and ( 2 ) manual . Projects may also be classified as ( 1 ) intellectual and ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be classified as ( 1 ) simple and ( 2 ) multi-problems ; projects may be classified as ( 1 ) simple and ( 2 ) complex . The multi-problem gives superior training in developing the technique of reasoning and " tends to make facts interesting and significant . " The project , particularly the complex project , in addition to developing the technique of reasoning , provides the natural setting for problems and carries facts into action . Making provision for the natural setting sometimes may be uneconomical . If so , the problem method is advisable . CHAPTER V IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING I. THE PROJECT AND MOTIVATION THE definition of the project includes the natural setting of the problem . This means that the problem has more significance for the learner . The natural setting of the project makes provision for a strong motive . The testing of seed corn for the father 's or for the boy 's own corn crop is more interesting than testing seed corn as a formal laboratory exercise . Testing the baking powder for the mother is connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . The class in school hygiene which makes a sanitary survey of the town with a view to improving health conditions works on a project which is connected with more interests than the study of the principles of hygiene in a school text . The boy who went to Robinson 's " History of Western Europe " to find the reasons why serious consideration is being given to the creation of Poland , probably would have read the history of the three partitions of Poland with 116 // far greater interest had this problem been used to vitalize the usual logical method in history . A statement by Charters illustrates this point : " The natural setting provides a strong motive , ? canning fruit for the family is more interesting , we will say , than cooking a little fruit in a small laboratory utensil . Treating the mold on fruit I have canned for winter use ' is more stimulating than , studying molds as ends in themselves . Studying sterilization to use immediately in putting up fruit for friends has much more appeal than merely studying sterilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beginnings of a varied and intensely fundamental sort tends to produce a great spontaneous interest . All projects are not interesting to any one student , but if a project is selected so as to be of interest , the degree of the interest is likely to be very high because of the setting in the experience of the student . It is claimed that when the project is interesting , it is very interesting . " i The project is able to create interest of a deep-seated sort because the interest comes from associative connections from many sources . The project offers many more reservoirs from which interest may be drawn . If it boy wishes to study or experiment with the method of testing seed corn merely to pass an examination or to make a grade in a certain course , the interest in the test or experiment flows in , or is irrigated from , the // grade or examination reservoir . But if , in addition , he is making the test in order to help his father to buy the seed corn economically , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he will receive a profit , if his own schooling or a trip for his mother depends upon the success of his project , then there are just so many more reservoirs of interest which are tapped by the project . If the testing of the seed corn is tied up with many more numerous interests than that of merely making a passing grade , then it means a greater amount of interest . The potentiality of interest in projects is great because of their wide and varied connections . Some teachers in agriculture find that the work done on the plots of ground owned by the school is not capable of arousing the genuine interest of pupils ; this is due probably to the artificial setting . When the work is taken up as projects at home and on their own farms great interest is aroused because of the natural setting for the problem . This means that the work on the home farm is tied up with more interests for the boy . The statement from MacHoke bears out this point . " We find home work giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by the school . Each boy in a daily course is required to keep records of cows on the farm . Farmers are urged to leave samples of milk or products of milk . These are tested by the high school , and reports are made to the farmers // and to the federal dairy department . We are testing sixty dairy cows at this time . More farmers will come in as soon as they have an opportunity to arrange it . We do a great deal of practical work on the farms near , such as pruning , spraying , making butter , oiling harness , judging stock , repairing machinery , growing crops . We are able to arouse deep interest among the pupils only by practical work in bringing subjects home to them , so that they can see the value of taking the course . The course is growing in popularity , and we anticipate large numbers next year . " 1 The psychology of the project seems very simple . Every one works with the greatest effort at the problem in which he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means that it is associated with many interests of the learner . It follows that the projects which are accepted for solution will be highly motivated ? they will be worked at with a maximum effort because they hold great significance for the learner . A need for the solution is felt . This idea is implied by Stimson in the following comment on the interest developed by the project method . " The methods by which the boy becomes on a small scale a farmer or business man for himself gives the project which he is carrying on and the school work in which he participates a reality not otherwise attainable . It heightens measurably his interest in the work and in the related study of the school , and . // must fix better than by any other device the training which he is receiving . " 1 Before concluding the topic of the project and motivation it should be pointed out that projects are not always intrinsically interesting , in spite of the claims made by the advocates of the project method . As Charters indicates : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no divine alchemy in the project . The project may be interesting to one class and not to another . It may be interesting to some children in the class and not to all . It can , of course , be shown that the possibilities of interest are much greater than in the facts learned in topical organization or even in multi-problems. " 2 II . THE PROJECT AND THINKING It is unnecessary to take up at any length the importance of thinking . It is more pertinent to present methods by which effective thinking may be attained , and in this discussion to show the relation of the project to thinking . A brief statement of the conditions which determine and promote thinking is accordingly presented herewith . Thinking occurs in a doubtful or perplexing situation ; it is the establishment of connections between means and ends . " Since the situation in which think- // ing occurs is a doubtful one , thinking is a process of inquiring , of looking into things , of investigation . " 1 Mind is active , not passive , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project in directing thinking is shown in the following statements . The student may propose and accept the project of installing an electric signal service in the home . In planning the installation he faces this problem of determining the amounts of material , the cost and initial steps of installation . After he has completed the project he may find that certain bells will not ring , which will cause him to review the whole situation . His problem for the time being will be to find the immediate difficulty and he will go to the individual bell that does not respond to find the trouble . He may resort to his source material and read about the essential parts of the bell ; and with this information he may find that the make-and-break connection was not properly adjusted . Again he may discover that certain windows when raised will not give the alarm , : grid this causes him to shift his attack to this problem He may trace out short circuits , he may find batteries poorly connected , or the battery solution not properly prepared . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously , and many other details may arise which will cause the boy to question himself , to examine his method , to abstract free ideas , to test // his application of principles , and to make readjustments to suit these given conditions . Each new problem or experience in the project leads the boy to shift his methods to meet and solve the difficulties . The projects , to be most educative , will develop situations bound to demand more thinking . To be thoroughly educative , the project must lead the individual to full activity , characteristic of a true project . The project gives the ideal organization of subject matter to arouse an aim and to direct thinking . The thinking of most worth to the individual is that which is directed by his own aims and not an aim held by someone else or one forced upon him . If the pupil has a specific aim he appreciates the difficulty he has to solve , and there is little doubt that he will be able to select his material intelligently to aid in the solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of much value . Teachers frequently have the notion that , if students are assigned difficult problems which they attempt to solve but fail , they are being given valuable training . There are , of course , few accurately derived data from which to gain light on this contention , but the alleged value is doubtful , particularly if we count the discouragement of the pupil which naturally follows an unaccomplished task . The sensitiveness of the pupil must be guarded , and teachers must not allow him to lose his self-confidence . // Organization of the schools and the curricula should provide opportunity for developing life situations , which will involve effectual thought . It may be a long time before our schools are so organized as to take care of the projects which typify life situations , but there is no excuse for not applying projects as far as possible without completely disorganizing our present system . Information , whether gained in school or outside of school , will be vitalized by close association with its use or function . The project offers a convenient unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey says : " Every recitation in every subject gives an opportunity for establishing cross connections between the subject matter of the lesson and the wider and more direct experiences of everyday life . " Processes of instruction are unified in the degree in which they center in the production of good habits of thinking . While we may speak , without error , of the method of thought , the important thing is that thinking is the method of an educative experience . The essentials of method are therefore identical with the essentials of reflection . They are first that the pupil have a genuine situation of experience ? that there be a continuous activity in which he is interested for its own sake ; secondly , that a genuine problem develop within this situation as a stimulus to thought ; third , that he possess the information and make the observations needed to deal with it ; fourth , that suggested solutions occur to him which he shall be responsible for developing in an orderly way ; fifth , that he // have opportunity and occasion to test his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover for himself their validity . " 1 The project as defined makes provision for the necessary requisites for thinking as outlined by Dewey . The following project is outlined to show how the project takes into account these items : The boy accepts the project of determining the value of each cow in his father 's herd of fifteen , with the additional idea of improving the production by proper rations . Possibly the father has agreed to credit him with half of his savings , with the understanding that this money is to aid in the boy 's college education . This type of project may be exaggerated . Possibly few projects can or will be tied up with so many points of interest , yet this one is not at all impossible , in fact , it has actually been used . It has the merit of giving the pupil a genuine situation . There is continuous activity in carrying the project forward when the pupil is interested . Second , there will be many genuine problems developing within this project , which will be a stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rations , the record of the products of each cow , and possibly will develop the determination to get rid of the non-paying cows and to invest in new and better stock . Situations arise daily which demand that the boy take an inventory of the conditions and make a hypothesis . Third , he must possess informa- // tion and take observations in order to make a success of his project . If he doubts his recommendations , he will go to the sources of information to help him solve the difficulties . It may be that a few days ' change of rations may seem rather expensive and not worth while , even though the production shows a slight gain . The authorities he consults will probably point out that a radical or material improvement can not be expected immediately . Fourth , suggested solutions of the method of improvement will come to him daily . He will be compelled to develop these hypotheses in an orderly way in order to check results . Fifth , this project affords ample opportunity and occasion to apply his ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rations , on breeds of stock , and he will be able to discover for himself the validity of these recommendations . In order to carry his project to completion with distinct success , it is not only possible , but necessary , that attention be given to the items which Dewey points out as essential to real thinking . The project directs thinking ; it develops the attitudes of scientific research that should be fostered in our secondary schools . Boys and girls in the secondary schools have plenty of projects and are eager to receive the teacher 's help in solving them . Indeed projects furnish the natural means for developing a scientific attitude . The pupil secures larger benefit if he originates the project , but by no means should we classify // projects as worthless if the teacher suggests them . The value then depends on whether the pupil accepts them as his own , and this is where skill in teaching will be of considerable service . The steps in the logical method of arriving at a solution of a problem are : ( 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( 3 ) hypothesis ; ( 4 ) verification . The project when carried to completion uses the identical steps of logical thinking . If the foregoing items were given as constituting the method the project employs in arriving at solutions , the statement would be wholly correct . The project furnishes the opportunity for placing pupils in situations in which it is absolutely necessary that they think in order to solve the difficulty . This point is well emphasized by J. C. Moore in the following paragraphs : " Pasteur , working on his asymmetric crystals of tartaric acid , came near being caught in the obscurity of university research , but Dumas called him to a real project , the elimination of the silkworm disease that was causing a loss of 20,000,000 kilograms of cocoons to France each year . He was not a technically trained biologist , but having felt the need , the problem became vital . He threw all his energies into the work , to the study he brought the resources from many fields , experimenting , testing , proving , until the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects , growing out of the needs of his day . The story of every // great invention is the story of a project , and in it we find the following elements : " A felt need , real , vital , growing out of the unanswered past of one 's environment . " A growing interest and enthusiasm calling for one 's best energies and resulting in activity . " A broad , comprehensive search for related material . " An organization of the results of personal activity for solving the given project . This summary does not differ greatly from Dewey 's analysis of the completed act of thought . " ' The relation of the project to thinking is indicated clearly by Charters . " An advantage claimed is that the natural setting and the great multi-problem with its coherent subordinate problems make the intellect function in a fuller tide of activity . The strong initial motive and the constant side lights from practical conditions and immediate practical outcomes makes the student think with a higher degree of effectiveness . " 2 The project must grip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's thinking will be better if he centers it in a unified theme or problem , so well embodied in the project . The pupil 's own projects , and not the teacher 's , quicken and coordinate his thinking . 128 THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING III . THE PROJECT AND HABIT-FORMATION It is a recognized fact that drill work is a significant function in education ; and it is equally true that at times we may have overemphasized the value of such drill . There is little doubt that a large amount of drill has been formal and unrelated to the student 's problem . Dewey well says : " Not less serious is exaggerated emphasis upon drill exercises designed to produce skill in action , independent of any engagement of thought-exercises having no purpose but the production of automatic skill . " 1 The corrective measure to apply to situations of this type is certainly not to propose a scheme which will consciously neglect drill work and habit-formation , or seemingly make no provision to take care of drills and habit-formation . Habits and skills are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be acquired incidentally in the project method . A methodology which makes no provision for habits and skills , other than in a purely incidental way , is seriously defective and may subject its proponents to the serious criticism that they are encouraging " soft pedagogy . " The importance which should be given to provisions for habit-formation is clearly indicated by Bagley : " The work of habit-building must always be accorded the most important place in elementary edu- // cation . That habits formed in the school may not function in the situations of later life is clearly apparent . That training may not spread ' beyond limits of the specific function trained suggests the advisability of limiting the strenuous processes of habit-building ( 1 ) to those automatic responses that will be of unquestioned service and ( 2 ) to those responses that may serve as concrete bases for the later development of concepts and ideals of conduct . . . . The fault of American schools today lies not in the mechanical grind that they are popularly supposed to represent , but in the inadequacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted . " 1 The need of drill and habit-formation which supplements the home project in teaching agriculture is recognized by Stimson . In the forenoon and afternoon groups the first period in each session is given to a general study of the productive side of agriculture and rural life . Before the close of each session a period is set aside to subject individual ideas and plans to the criticism of the entire class , to clarify principles , and to intensify impressions through drill . The time used to give a single focus of attention through llective action . This is a step in the right direction . These periods for the single focus of attention should be frequent enough to guarantee that skills and habits will be formed ; otherwise the pupils will be interested the projects and will fail to get the habits and skills they are entitled to receive . // The acquiring of habits and skills may , however , be stimulated by the project method . In carrying forward a given project , the pupils may discover that they are lacking in certain habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this deficiency . This realization of the lack creates the natural setting for a project in the acquisition of the needed skills and habits . For example , in one project in physics , it was discovered by the class that they were deficient in algebraic equations . It was a third-year class and they had had no algebra since their first year in high school . Lacking the ability to factor and to solve simple algebraic equations , the class made the request that this drill be furnished . The writer took five hours extra time to complete this project . Another class found in a second grade that its game of bean-bag was being retarded because of lack of accuracy and speed in the addition of simple numbers . A project immediately developed out of this situation , having for its aim the development of speed and accuracy in the addition of simple number combinations . Both these projects in drill illustrate how projects may arise that are primarily concerned with skills and habits . These represent problems which arose in their natural setting and were carried over into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indisputable that the drills and exercises in habit-formation will be undertaken with more zeal if first introduced through a project than if merely set // up as tasks to be done quite apart from any problem ; the pupil sees the reason for the drill . The weakness of the project in making provision for drills and exercises in habit-formation is a real one . The difficulty lies in providing for a sufficient number of projects which have as one of their outcomes the habit or skill which should be developed . On the other hand , it is often difficult to bring to the learner the need for the habit or skill . To the extent , however , that the learner feels or realizes the need for the habits and skills , to that extent he will put forth more vigorous activity and effort to accomplish the task . The attempt to minimize the importance of skills and habits does not answer the problem . To be accepted widely , the project method must make provision in the selection of projects to be pursued for the development of skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of the facts learned in the project setting . IV . THE PROJECT AND ACTION The technique of carrying an act to completion needs to be taught as well as the theory , for the process of carrying out a problem to completion is as difficult as the learning of the theory . This value of the project in developing the technique of action is well summarized by Charters : " The acquisition of skill in carrying out processes in actual practice is an advantage claimed . After the // student has learned fruit canning or bread making or hat designing in school as a project she is able to can fruit , make bread , and design hats at home . She does not know mere theory ; she has learned the method of performance . The advocates of the project method assert that after the theory is learned there is a wide zone of danger in carrying out the solution , a zone full of difficulties which may ruin the effectiveness of the performance . They point to the fact that some students of home economics whose mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very inefficient home makers . These advocates explain this by saying that the performance of the act itself involves a very important technique which needs as careful attention as does the solution of the theoretical problems or multi-problems . Nor can it be any more safely left to chance , they say , in the expectation that the student will pick it up for herself at some future time than can the learning of the theory . It is essential to a successful hold upon the subject . " 1 The theory underlying the preparation and serving of a breakfast may have been learned thoroughly by the girl in household science . She knows the method of making coffee , preparing fruit , cereals , toast , and eggs . She has learned the proper method of setting the table , and the rules for serving . In the laboratory she has carried out each of these small exercises with success and could recite thoroughly upon the principles underlying each . // When she accepts the project of preparing the breakfast , setting the table , and serving , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these activities at the same time . Her problem would be to use her time economically and yet not have the eggs , toast , or coffee prepared before the cereals or the fruit . Taking for granted that she would eat breakfast with the family , her method of procedure would be as follows : First , she places the teakettle on the stove and while the water is heating she assembles the materials for the breakfast and places the breakfast dishes on a tray . The water being heated by this time she prepares the breakfast food , which usually requires stirring for four or five minutes with rapid heat , and then she places the cereal in the top of a water bath . She then prepares the coffee . Next she puts the bread in an oven or in a toaster , drops eggs in boiling water for poaching , and assuming that three to five minutes will be sufficient to cook the coffee , eggs , and toast , that time will be used in setting the table . This is a real problem that confronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them state that the most difficult thing they had to learn was to be able to have three or four foods cooking at the same time , so started that each will be done at the proper time . Much of our teaching has usually left this carrying-out process to the pupils ; but this can not be any more safely relegated to chance than can the learning of the theory . // A statement by Mann commenting on the value of carrying the problem over into action is significant : " Among the professional engineers there is a very marked demand for what they call general engineering science . ' It is pointed out that a man who graduates from a civil engineering course frequently makes his success in life in mechanical engineering or vice versa . It is also pointed out that all engineering problems are essentially projects and that many of them involve a wide knowledge of the different fields of science . To be a successful engineer thus involves having the ability to tackle and solve projects efficiently and this ability is acquired like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It , therefore , follows that the most efficient training of engineers is likely to be secured in those schools in which the project method of instruction is used most freely . " 1 It is clear from this statement of Mann 's that there is a special technique involved in carrying the act to completion . Many engineers know the theory , but fail in making the applications . The project offers a means of providing the training in action . The project method takes care of the technique of carrying out a complete act . If the boy has been taught agriculture by the project method he knows how to do things . He does not know merely the theoretical phases of growing potatoes ; he has learned the method of performance . The project provides for // the technique of the completion of the act after the theoretical problem has been solved . V. SUMMARY The project creates interest of a deep-seated sort because the interest comes from associative connections of many types . The project offers countless reservoirs from which interest may be drawn . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected so as to be of interest , the degree of the interest is likely to be very high , because of its setting in the experience of the student . Of course , it can be shown that the possibilities of interest are much greater than in the facts acquired in topical organization . The project gives the ideal organization of subject matter for arousing an aim and the directing of thinking . It is a plausible assumption that the thinking most worth while to the individual is that which is directed by his own aim and not by some one else , or by an aim forced upon him . If the pupil has a specific goal which he understands and if he knows the difficulty which he has to solve , there is little doubt that he will be able to select intelligently the material needed for the solution . The strong initial motive of the project , with the constant side lights from practical conditions , challenges the student to think with a higher degree of effectiveness . The importance of habit-formation is too important to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits will be formed incidentally . A methodology which makes no provision for these other than in a purely incidental way is seriously defective and makes its theory subject to serious criticism . The weakness of the project in making provision for drills and exercises in habit-formation is genuine . The attempt to minimize the importance of skills and habits does not answer the problem . The project method , to be accepted widely , must make provision for skills and habits . It must be supplemented by a systematic presentation , organization , review , and repetition . The project method takes care of the technique of carrying out a complete act . If the boy has been taught agriculture by the project method , he knows how to do things . He has learned the method of performance . The project provides for the technique of the completion of the act after the theoretical problem has been solved . " The acquisition of skill in carrying out processes in actual practice " is an advantage claimed for the project . The relation of the project to the curriculum will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROJECT AND THE CURRICULUM I. THE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC METHODS IN CURRICULUM ORGANIZATION THIS is the era of efficiency in educational procedure , for on all sides there is evidence of quantitative and qualitative methods being applied to the problems of education . Guess work and hazy impressions are being replaced by information wrought out by scientific investigations . The results of teaching are to a large extent now being measured by standardized tests . This scientific procedure has found its way into all phases of school administration and supervision . Scientific methods applied to curriculum making have just made a beginning . This backwardness is due pretty largely to the fact that the objectives of teaching have not been analyzed . Such objectives as " complete living , " " adaptation of the individual to his environment , " " social efficiency , " are , without further analysis , too general to be of any particular help in suggesting materials which make up the curriculum . Since it has been very difficult to propose a definite scheme whereby these vague objectives might 137 // be realized , the tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without modification , that had been in use . II . PRINCIPLES AND ILLUSTRATIONS OF CURRICULUM MAKING The general principles of curriculum making are fairly simple . No matter what type of occupation the individual goes into , it will consist in carrying out certain activities , in other words , projects . If the school through a scientifically organized curriculum is to prepare these individuals for rendering efficient service , it must give help to the individual in carrying on these activities . It follows that in order to give this help , those responsible for making the curriculum must know what facts , processes , principles , habits , skills , and ideals are necessary for the various activities for which the curriculum prepares . Since the occupations are so numerous , these smaller objectives , which the curriculum maker must consider , will be far from few . There are at least four bases for the construction of a curriculum ? facts , principles , processes , and projects . The first three of these are usually included in the type of organization which is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , the principal methods of curriculum making are the logical and project methods . The logical organization represents a perfected sysTHE // tern , its materials are arranged in subdivisions , topics , paragraphs , according to the demands made of the material from a logical standpoint . Logical organization demands that the material be put together so that there are no omissions and so that each topic can be given its relative place in some sort of scheme previously determined . If the project is made the basis for curriculum making , it is necessary to decide what principles should be mastered by the students and then select projects or groups of projects from which the student may select . The projects selected will be such that all the facts , principles , and processes will be covered which ordinarily are covered in the logical or systematic presentation . The facts , principles , and processes are now studied as the need arises in carrying the projects to completion and the student realizes their functional value . ( a ) A Curriculum in Woodworking Based on Projects The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or processes and on projects has been worked out by L. R. Fuller , Regional Director of Industrial Education . The systematic or logical organization of a course in woodworking is indicated and the effect of the use of the project on this organization is shown by him . ' According to systematic organization in woodwork // the following thirty-two processes are involved . The method of dealing with these from the logical or systematic point of view would be to give examples , illustrations , and drill on each process until fairly well mastered and then pass on to the next process . The project method of teaching these thirty-two processes would be to select projects the carrying of which to completion would involve the processes indicated above . Projects were analyzed by Fuller to find out just what processes would be used . He selected projects that involve the type of repairs and work needed in the homes . In eight projects , ? building walks , door , screen , floor , and furniture repairs , conveniences for the home , handles in tools , and sharpening tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above thirty-two processes were represented , while some processes as planing , scoring , and sawing were involved in six of the projects . This group of eight // projects could be selected , then , as the basis for giving training in at least thirty processes . // The foregoing table shows a group of selected projects , giving the number of times each of the processes has been used in the series of projects . After each project , the different processes involved are indicated . The numbers to the right of the processes indicate the number of times they are employed in the projects listed . Each is counted only once to a project . It will be noted that in the topical method one would teach these thirty-two processes by exercises in those particular processes . Teaching these processes by the project method , they are learned in connection with life situations . The functional value of skills is realized . These are problematic acts carried to completion their natural setting . If we take one of the projects , the building of walks , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 of the systematic outline are used , and the project of making a table involves twenty-two processes . It will be noticed that some of the processes are used many times in the completion of the group of projects . Since planing and sawing require more practice and are more frequently used than some of the other processes , it is fair to state that these projects were selected with the purpose of giving drill where most necessary . ( b ) Illustrations of Curricula Based on Projects An interesting reorganization of curricula is being worked out by Professor H. M. Goettsch at the University of Cincinnati . After sixteen weeks ' prelimiTHE // nary training in elementary chemistry , the freshmen are given problems in industrial chemistry on which they work for ten weeks from 8 A.M. to 4 : 30 P.M. Thus the principles of industrial chemistry are developed as needed in carrying the projects to completion . " Projects such as to make baking powder and determine whether it is better and cheaper than you can buy ' are assigned without any instructions or references , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library and the laboratory . In the period of ten weeks he completes a number of these projects covering a wide range of topics , but little effort is made to present the topics in logical or any other sort of orderly sequence . Much emphasis is placed on synthetic work and on the cost of a given product by different processes ; while chemical analysis and the ionic theories of matter , which usually occupy the center of the stage in chemistry courses , here take a subordinate place . " 1 The Sub-Committee on General Science of the National Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education is giving serious consideration to abandoning the strict organization of sciences according to t heir content in the first and second years of the high school . As a substitute , it is proposed to teach the facts , laws , principles , and processes from all the sciences in connection with a series of projects . // " According to the plan proposed the project would be the basis of organization for the scientific facts and principles that were needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project were the raising and marketing of an acre of potatoes , the students would study the physics and chemistry of the soils and fertilizers , the topography and drainage of the ground , the rainfall and weather conditions , the structure and physiology of the potato plant , the development of varieties by breeding , the physical and chemical effects of tillage , the insect enemies and the appropriate insecticides , the bird enemies of the injurious insects , the cooking and the food value of the potato , the nature and uses of potato starch , the marketing of the potatoes and so on . " 1 The student in carrying to completion any of the projects noted would see and realize the need for accurately determined facts . Because he wished to learn he would investigate , collect data , and form judgments .

This method is described by C. R. Allen . ' As suggested by Allen there are two plans for the organization of subject matter in the curriculum . The one is the method by independent subjects and the other the scheme of major and minor subjects . These two plans have been recognized . The former method has selected the desirable subjects to be taught in the curriculum and has made plans for their development independently . The various subjects in the high school curriculum have been treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different subjects . History is // taught chronologically , but is not connected with civics . Mathematics is taken up according to the logical arrangement of the textbook and often does not relate to drawing , to physics , or to chemistry . Allen illustrates this scheme by the following diagram : The line AB may represent the particular items of knowledge learned by the pupils on a given day by the independent organization . It is quite improbable that the knowledge learned in mathematics will have any relation to the drawing , to the English , or to history . " It is very improbable , for example , that if his history lesson deals with the method of administering justice in England in the Middle Ages that his civics lesson at the same time will deal with the modern method of court procedure which is derived from the old English procedure ; that if his civics lesson deals with a question of community planning , his drawing lesson will in any way involve , for example , the laying out of a park plan on paper . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged that the different lessons learned on the same day could center around the same problem or idea . Under the independent scheme of organizaTHE // tion , the boy in the shop finds it practically impossible to secure technical information in the different subjects at the time he needs it . In the drawing job he needs the assistance of certain formulae for the particular job , in the history of the trade , how the operation was performed a hundred years ago . Under the arrangement by independent subjects he may get some of this information next week or perhaps he had some of it so long ago that he has forgotten it . If the subject matter of the different subjects could be taken up at the time when it was needed in connection with some particular job , the students would realize its functional value . The correlation in such a case would be excellent . In contrast with the method of independent subjects , the " major and minor subject " scheme is based upon the idea of selecting some one subject considered to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . ' In the illustration , the requirements of the shop work will determine the order of all other lines of instruction . 150 THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING " In such an organization when the boy has the turning of a taper in the machine shop , he gets at that time , in his materials of trade , the study of the problem of the selection of proper stock ; in his mathematics , the figuring of the offset ; and in his history of trade , the information as to how they got a taper before they had a lathe . Under this method the only line of work which would show logical progression would be the shop work . If we were to take the materials of trade , the mathematics or the history , and should arrange those topics as they might come to the boy , they would offer an entirely disconnected series , the only progressive subject being his shop experience . This scheme is indicated in the diagram , where the line AB would indicate the progress of the boy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had reached the problem of turning a taper , and the various arrows pointing to that particular point would indicate the parts of such subjects as materials of trade , mathematics , etc. , which bear upon that particular problem . " Since the above method of instruction is based upon the idea of selecting the most important subject and subordinating all other subjects to that , it obviously affords opportunity for a much closer correlation than the first scheme . It is much more likely to meet the condition in the earlier stages of the average pupil 's progress , where the dominant subject is unquestionably shop experience . In suggesting this method for use in the vocational schools , there has simply been recommended the plan which has been always recognized as the more efficient of the two . " 1 // The main reason which the writer gives for this method is that in an industrial school it teaches the student to know how to perform the processes necessary to carry on his trade and insures that he will be paid for what he can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method of independent subjects might be used effectively . The writer indicates which of these two methods is named the project . " To experiences in a major subject , around which are grouped the fragments of minor related subjects that apply , we have given the name project , ' and the method of instruction based upon a series of such projects we have called the project method . ' " The educational use of the project , according to this writer , " implies that in connection with the discharge of a responsibility , problems must be solved , the solution of which involves an educational experience , and that there is a problem in some major subject of instruction , the solution of which requires the student to acquire and apply fragments of minor subjects . According to the aim of the course of instruction , the portion of the major subject , or core ' of the project , may lie in any field of instruction . For example , the major subject might lie in the field of English composition . In writing a composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use figures of speech , and in general , apply to that particular problem ( writing the composition ) fragments drawn from the fields covered by the subjects commonly taught under the names of spelling ' penmanship ' English gram152 THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING mar , ' and rhetoric . ' In a similar way , projects might be organized around a core ' taken from the field of history or mathematics or civics. " 1 III . PROJECTS NEED NOT CUT ACROSS SUBJECTS OF THE CURRICULUM These examples might seem to convey the idea that for complete success with the project method , it would be necessary to have it cut across two or more subjects of the curriculum . This is not a necessary inference , nor is this cutting across many subjects of the curriculum a necessary element in the efficiency of the project method . It is true that the projects may be so selected as to include two or more subjects of the curriculum , but it is likewise true that the work can be made just as effective if the project is kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bell system in the home falls within the field of physics . Testing the baking powder for the home falls within the field of chemistry . The preparation of the meals at home or canning fruit falls within the field of home economics . IV . OBSOLETE MATERIAL IN SCHOOL CURRICULA The criticism of schools and school curricula for their failure to give instruction which is practical , instruction along project lines , is due in large measure to the // fact that we rarely eliminate from our textbooks but are constantly adding . It takes a long time to eliminate from the textbooks and courses of study operations and materials which have become obsolete . This situation is due in part to the lack of an opportunity to use the material of the curriculum in solving difficulties arising in their natural setting , in the pupil 's home and school life . The project method eliminates obsolete material for it uses only such subject matter as is necessary for the solution of the project . ' V. THE PROJECT AS THE BASIS FOR CURRICULUM ORGANIZATION If the projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work were carefully classified and the data selected from a large number representing different localities , this series of projects , with the principles which they define and illustrate , would be a most effective basis for use in the organization of the curriculum in agriculture . It would be possible , although difficult , to collect a large number of life-projects in the various occupations , industries , and professions . // If these projects were national in their scope , the materials used in carrying them to completion would form a partial basis for the curriculum . There is serious difficulty in trying to organize a curriculum based entirely upon the material from this source . Great care would have to be taken in the completeness of the selection of the projects ; the principles underlying them would have to be defined ; and , again , a course of study based entirely on this idea might be subject to the criticism that we are training the students to meet situations which , in all probability , will no longer exist when they are ready to use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture is clearly presented by Bobbitt . " The curriculum-discoverer wishes , for example , to draw up a course of training in agriculture . He will go out into the practical world of agriculture as the only place that can reveal the objectives of agricultural education . He will start out without prejudgment as to the specific objectives . All that he needs for the work is pencil , notebook , and a discerning intelligence . He will observe the work of the farmers ; he will talk with them about all aspects of their work ; and he will read reliable accounts which give insight into their activities . From these sources he will discover the particular things that the farmers do in carrying on each piece of work ; the specific knowledge which the farmers employ in planning and performing each specific task ; the kinds of judgment at which they must arrive ; the types of problems they must solve ; the habits and skills demanded by the state ; the // attitudes of mind , appreciations , valuations , ambitions , and desires , which motivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curriculum organization be used , ? that is , a compilation of the life projects in that field , ? it will be well to supplement it with a systematic organization . The systematic or logical point of view will give the learner more cues to aid him in solving a new problem . Principles will not be tied up in a few concrete examples . ' Though there are many practical difficulties seen in attempting to use this method as the basis for curriculum organization and construction , and while few of even the most enthusiastic advocates would recom- // mend that it be used as the only method in determining minimal essentials of subject matter , yet there is no excuse for not collecting these data as widely as possible and using them for what they are worth . No one can doubt that it will be valuable for the project to become " the center of logical organization for the information gained , just as it does in the case of the problems worked out by the farmer , the mechanic , the municipal engineer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings results to pass in the world of adult activity . Time may be and should be taken , at intervals , to organize the information gained in working out the projects , in accordance with the reference book or a compendium type of arrangement ; and this work of organization may constitute a series of projects in themselves which will arouse much interest , if skillfully handled . " 1 VI . SUMMARY The method of organizing the curriculum on the basis of the project method is well summarized by Charters . " If the project is to be made the basis of the curriculum , it is necessary for the teacher to decide as scientifically as possible what principles and processes should be mastered by the student and then to select not single projects but groups of projects so arranged // that election of projects is made possible with the certainty that all essential facts , processes , and principles will be covered . Then , when the principles and processes have been covered by the project method in class , enough time should be left in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the project is used for the approach to all parts of the subject , and then a systematizing study of the field follows as an extended summary . " 1 CHAPTER VII APPLICATION OF THE PROJECT IDEA IN Chapter III it was stated that while the term project has been but recently added to our educational terminology , the idea behind the term has been used with some modification in many subjects , such as engineering , medicine , law , journalism , salesmanship , and foreign language teaching . The uses which these different subjects have made of the project idea will be discussed in this chapter . // An attempt to approximate the project idea has been back of some of the methods in engineering education since the foundation of the first engineering school in America , the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute founded in 1824 . The Rensselaer school was not able at first to own its own shops , but the founder directed ? " that with the consent of the proprietors , a number of well-cultivated farms and workshops in the vicinity of the school be entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scholastic exercises for the students , where the application of the sciences may be most conveniently taught . " The first curriculum at Rensselaer required for completion one year , divided into three terms . The students began with an " experimental term , " gathering specimens and visiting shops and factories near the school , later discussing in class the information obtained . In the last nine weeks of the year the students applied their knowledge to practical projects in the local engineering shops . Mann 's description is interesting : " The students are required in the first three weeks of the first term to examine the operations of artists and manufacturers at the school workshops under the direction of a professor or assistant , who shall explain the scientific principles upon which such operations depend , four hours on each of six days in every week . This plan is identical in principle with that now in use at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale . There the students spend their whole time for three weeks before the opening of the second year in a well-organized course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no actual manual work in shops . The purpose of the course as stated in the catalogue is , to acquaint the student with the terms and processes in use in manufacturing and power plants , and to give him some personal contact with engineering work ( before taking up his studies in the classroom and the drafting room . ' " // Both of these methods illustrate the effort made to raise the problem in its natural setting . The students see the commercial operations in their natural setting and to that extent the procedure approaches the idea of the project . The exercises are not true projects because the students did not carry out any of the processes ; they did not acquire any manual skill , nor were principles developed as needed in carrying any of the processes to completion . Another method of handling the shop problem is illustrated at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute . There on the campus is established a small manufacturing plant where twenty journeymen are regularly employed and articles made for the open market . The students work side by side with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monotonous repetition . Apparently the students are not kept at a process longer than is necessary to obtain a fair mastery . In addition to this , the students are given thorough training in scientific shop management . This method illustrates the project method . The only place at which it seems to fall short is in the lack of this small plant 's facilities to present real typical manufacturing projects , although the students undoubtedly receive excellent training in the few processes required for the business of this particular shop . A plant of this sort will necessarily be small and will not be so well equipped as are the regular commercial plants ; consequently the projects will not be quite // typical . The Worcester plan gives training in the principles and processes of engineering under industrial conditions . ' Another interesting approach to the project method is carried out in connection with the shop work in the engineering college at the University of Illinois . The production of a salable article is regarded as an essential part of the shop training . The manufacturing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operation by the most efficient methods , within limits , were developed . The whole idea was to present to the students a progressive shop with a corresponding progressive policy . This phase of the work is commented on by Benedict : " The scope of the mechanical organization was the same as in commercial shop practice when similar results were sought , and it may fairly be said that in respect to methods and facilities the shop laboratories are on an equal plane of efficiency with any well organized industrial plant engaged in manufacturing similar products . " 2 While emphasis is placed on the mechanical facilities for production , yet the main training which this ex- // perimcnt seeks is that of demonstrating the principles underlying modern commercial methods of manufacturing . Each student or group of students has a different role to play , so that by the end of the year , all have had experience in every phase of production and manufacturing . The experiment has many of the project elements . There is an effort made to have the work developed in a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the shop laboratories must be " true to life " ; i.e. , correspond in all essentials of methods and equipment to commercial plants of recognized merit . Although this is a very effective laboratory method , it does not illustrate a true project . Principles are not developed by the students as needed , for , in a large measure , the students merely follow directions . The method used in the University of Illinois and its relation to the project is well summarized by Mann . " In this Illinois plan construction is still an integral part of instruction ; but the omission of the journeyman mechanics shifts the emphasis from actual commercial production , subject to the objective test of salability in the open market , to instruction about methods of commercial production . The shop becomes a shop laboratory ' and the manipulations there partake of the nature of experiments designed to verify the principles of production that are operative in the industrial world , rather than to solve problems that arise in connection with their productive activities . As in most current laboratory work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be that of following directions intelligently , rather than that of finding the answers to questions that can not be answered without making laboratory tests . " 1 The most elaborate attempt to institute the natural setting for engineering problems has been developed by Schneider at the University of Cincinnati . It is known as the " cooperative system " of education . The development of this system was due to the fact that the old apprenticeship system had broken down under the strain of the varied commercial demands and that the colleges of engineering were making little effort to connect theory and practice . The colleges that were attempting to give practice were maintaining their own shops and plants at a tremendous expense . It became apparent that to try to keep up with illustrative shops would be out of the question . To Professor Schneider belongs the credit for planning a course which could use the established manufacturing plants for the practical training , thereby allowing the University of Cincinnati to devote its energies to the theoretical . The course outlined by Professor Schneider in engineering covers five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the students may spend two weeks out of four in the University and two weeks in the cooperating manufacturing plants . There are two shifts of students , so that while one group is in // the University the other is in the plants . The practical work is carried on continuously . The cooperating firms represent every important phase of engineering , and the work is so arranged that the student will be able to get practical training in all phases of his specialty . In railway engineering he will work out problems in connection with a real railroad . The work of the course is outlined so that there is constant correlation between the work done in the plants and that done in the University . The practical projects undertaken determine the subject matter to be taught in the period spent in the classroom . There seems to be heightened interest in both the practical and theoretical work . The wages earned by the students in the cooperative plants give an added incentive . The scheme has had a wholesome influence on the curriculum as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Descriptive material that has no apparent place is eliminated and the additional time is spent in drilling on fundamentals . The feature of the cooperative education which is the most important from the school standpoint is the " realization of theory through its practical application . " The practical work , carried on in the cooperative factories , creates for the students problems which demand solution . The cooperative course is so graded that no task is undertaken which is beyond the student 's ability . The problem of doing a certain task demands that he apply his theory gained in the previous two // weeks ' period and apply it to this situation . In addition new problems arise which demand solution during the practice terms , allowing the student opportunity to develop principles as needed . The cooperative plan offers the advantage of providing a real shop atmosphere where commercial products of a large variety are manufactured and subjected to the test of their salability . By this scheme projects are carried to completion in their natural setting . Another interesting approach to the project method is the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical work of surveying . The practice work usually given in connection with the surveying courses has been ( 1 ) the surveying of the campus , ( 2 ) the summer-camp work where a certain amount of territory is assigned , and ( 3 ) actual practical work . Professor C. E. Sherman gives the account of the beginning of the Summer Surveying Courses at the Ohio State University . " In response to student sentiment , and in view of the fact that the campus exercises gave no noticeable proficiency in the use of the instruments , nor an adequate idea of procedure in the field , a special course in field practice was tried in June , 1888 . " The class of seven second-year civil engineers in charge of Professor Brown , after studying land and railroad surveying for a year , spent one week in June in making a reconnaissance , preliminary , and location survey for a proposed electric railway two and a half miles long , between two small towns distant about // 60 miles from the University in the rough southeastern portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , map drawn up in pencil , and earthwork partly figured before leaving the field . " 1 In 1900 the University authorities provided a camp equipment and this practice training was continued in the camps from 1900 to 1902 . These camps gave excellent practice , furnishing an opportunity to show the difficulties met in surveying that would not be brought out on the level campus . The work was rotated , in order to give the students different types of training . Office work was done each night , ? plotting notes , inking maps , and calculating earth work . This work did not constitute a true project , but rather a multi-problem . The work was done to pass a school requirement and to give laboratory work . The students who were excused from these " laboratory " camps to go on practical work came back to their tasks in the fall with so fine a spirit that after three sessions it was decided to try the practical summer-camp system . The work of the practical summer camp is done under the supervision of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The experience of the class as a whole varies widely in amount and character , but this may be looked upon as an advantage , // for , " in the work before the class in the lecture room , it arouses the members when points are brought forward from their collective experience . " The aim of the department has not been to give identical training to each member of the camp , but rather to provide a real task , " the accomplishing of which will forcibly illustrate to the student the use of the instruments and methods of his calling . " 1 When the student sees instructors attempting real problems and relying on each to do his share , it encourages a spirit difficult to get in imaginary or practice problems . The students are expected to give suggestions and to question the work at any stage . The practical summer camp and actual employment with practicing surveyors are both superior to the practice summer camp . The advantages for the practical summer-camp work are : ( 1 ) The student gets more thorough drill on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 2 ) The sense of responsibility is increased . ( 3 ) The job creates greater interest and enthusiasm . The opponents of the practical summer-camp schema maintain that in the practical camp it is " difficult to adapt the work to meet exactly the educational needs of the students , the incessant and comprehensive drill in fundamental principles . " // The practical surveying approximates the project . If , however , the purpose is merely to illustrate principles previously learned then it is not a project because there are no problems involved . On the other hand , if principles are developed in this practical work as needed , then it is the project method . Problematic acts are carried to completion in their natural setting . II . THE LEGAL AND MEDICAL CLINICS Some of the ideas embodied in project teaching have been incorporated in medical education under the interneship and clinics . Recently the need recognized in legal education for a type of training which would give the students practice in carrying through a case in its natural setting has led to a type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally conceded that training in legal reasoning and substantive law can be most economically learned in the law school . This point is emphasized by E. M. Morgan : " It is doubtless true that familiarity with the principles of practice and their application could be most effectively acquired in some offices , if the lawyers in charge thereof were so minded . But only in those offices having a general practice could anything like a comprehensive knowledge of the subject be attained without a great deal of independent investigation . At present , the offices of general practice are few ; and in those few offices the time of the experienced men is // considered too valuable to be spent in the instruction of embryo jurists. " 1 The instructors in the law schools are beginning to feel that some provision should be made to give this training in practice in connection with the work of the law school . As Morgan indicates : " There would seem to be no more reason for failing or refusing to teach the principles of practice than for dropping the usual courses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requisites of pleadings , the effect of defects and irregularities therein , and the methods of attacking them , and refuse to give instruction as to the same matters with reference to process ? Is it less essential that a student know the effect of an appearance than that he know the effect of pleading over ? The principles underlying the right to a jury , the selection of jurors , and the right to open and close , to take or force a dismissal , and to secure a directed verdict ; the rules governing instructions to the jury and requests therefor ; . . . the privileges and limitations of counsel in arguing to the jury ; the prerequisites and grounds of motions for a new trial , judgment notwithstanding the verdict , or an appeal ? all these and other matters of practice are fully as important as the rules of evidence . They are almost as adequately treated in the decisions , and are as readily and as satisfactorily taught by the case method . And , in fact , the rules of pleading and evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and principles of practice . " 2 170 THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING It is possible to be familiar with the principles and rules of evidences and practice and not be able to recognize their applicability to a given case . This situation is similar to one in which the girl in household science may know the principles of a balanced meal , the principles of interior decoration , and yet may be helpless in applying these to the improvement of home conditions . The real test of ability in practice is shown in the power to apply rules to concrete cases . In law likewise , ? " the real criterion of one 's knowledge of procedure is one 's ability to apply its rules , as well as the principles of substantive law , not to cases where only the relevant and material facts are given , but to cases as they actually arise in everyday life and as they are presented in court . " 1 In attempting to provide a substitute for real practice , the moot or practice court was proposed . This has many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carrying a case forward to completion . Evidence is taken , briefs are prepared , and the pleadings made , yet the one serious drawback is that the situation is not real . There are no real witnesses , the whole thing lacks the human element . The student has no responsibility to protect the rights of the client , " the so-called witnesses are ready to his hand ; they
