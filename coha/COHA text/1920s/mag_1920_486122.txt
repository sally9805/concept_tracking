W HO is Beethoven that in this dark , uncertain hour we celebrate him as incomparable and mighty ? No longer do the modern peoples like the nations of antiquity present a complete inner unity ; no longer is any folk like a staff of metal that yields but one tone when the hammer of fate strikes . And that is most true of the German folk , divided from the beginning . A myriad souls separate themselves from the mass and yet remain in their hovering state part of it . I shall not call these creatures of the spirit the flower of the nation nor yet its heart . But they are its wings with which it dares to rise from the abyss and face the sun . Nothing in them is worthy of surviving in so far as they are essentially estranged from the character of their folk . Yet isolation is their portion and their destiny is hard . For on them hangs the nation 's fate and they are the administrators of civilization 's heritage . Tossed hither and yon by great pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatively akin to the gods in their impulse to embody the wealth that is within them . But often the fate of Icarus is theirs , for the element of the unsocial and the speechless in their nation is to them a source of torment . They are consumed by a feeling of incommunicable inner riches . Thus in the midst of mankind they have been lonely . To speak for them came Werther  --  measureless passion ; came Faust  --  measureless aspiration . For them did Schiller project into space those characters who oppose to the laws of the world the law of their hearts . But the creative urge of these men did not find the word of Werther sufficient nor even the word of Faust ultimate and Schiller 's figures were the eloquence of their dreams , not the sinew of their deeds . For Schiller 's final intention was political and from it these German souls , unripe and overripe at once , turn aside . They strive after the living word and the living deed and yearn for the ideal union of these two . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassioned hearts . They needed one to bring unity to their soul 's division , to purify and consecrate their excess of sensitiveness , to be their priest and speaker before God , their sayer of the inexpressible . Thus did the spirit of the nation cry and Beethoven appeared . He entered the world of Haydn and Mozart , but his relation to music was no longer an innocent and naive one . In his hands the singing voice of the orchestra no longer intoned the pure harmony of creation ; it sang the stubborn solitary soul 's delight and pain . Alone he spoke in sound with his own heart , with his beloved , with God . Often that speech was halting and of a divine confusion . Out of a soul unbroken and still devout he created a speech that transcends all speech . In this speech there is something that is beyond sound , symphony , hymn , or prayer . It is inexpressible . It is the gesture of a man who stands before God . The word of liberation was found . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the living word and the living deed and the two were one . His work derives from no folk art . The folk does not recognize itself in his music . But those who have arisen from the folk and are yet of it discern their own and their nation 's character in him . For he was like a man of the people in his unbroken soul . But he had what the people has not nor many who use the word  --  intellectual passion . He was strong and innocent and intrepid as a child . But presage and aspiration lifted him into yet uncharted regions . He was veracious , knowing all things of the soul save doubt , all things of the heart save frivolity . He was like Moses who was fated to speak to God for his folk and was a stammerer . His body and his soul were one and at last his great tormented countenance took on the aspect of his work and his grave is the grave of a hero . It is a solemn thing to remember such a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tread in the print of his feet . It is the more solemn because this remembering comes to a great people in its hour of humiliation . But in darkness the constellations gleam and the soul is uplifted . This nation is stricken but not broken . It suffers in deep thought . It is aware of guilt toward its own spirit and would raise its heart above that guilt . Again it seeks rebirth through individuals conscious of the inexhaustible depth of their souls , and again these are lamed by the centrifugal and uneloquent character of the nation . The spoken word that should make for unity makes for separateness and divides men into heretics and anti-heretics . Thus the spirit of the nation has no single speech , no center for its activity and sickens of strange , confusing thoughts . But the creative individuals think of Beethoven and of that throne of passion whence the ardor of thought flies forth to snare the eternal . They are not eloquent and distrust spoken words through an inner chastity . But in their hearts is a speechless language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uttermost darkness of life but also a hope that knows no bound . Thus in this solemn hour we are united , and where but two or three of us are gathered together , there towers above us a countenance of inscrutable expression , riven and devout at once  --  templum in modum arcis , a shrine in the shape of a citadel  --  the countenance of Beethoven .
