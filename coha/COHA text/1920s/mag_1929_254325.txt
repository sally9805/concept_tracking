Artist Rockwell Kent said " exceptional knavery . " Juror Richard J. Walsh of The John Day Co. , said " miscarriage of justice . " Jeweler Chapin Marcus , of Marcus &; Co. , Manhattan jewelers , said " little evidence of professional spirit . " General Manager and Publicity Director Charles A. Hammarstrom said nothing . Advertising men in general said " regrettable . " <P> The cause of these various opinions was a controversy resulting from the recent ( TIME , March 18 ) Harvard Awards-advertising prizes . This year 's jury awarded to Marcus &; Co. , " with recognition to Charles A. Hammarstrom , " the sum of $1,000 " for the advertisement most effective in its use of pictorial illustration as the chief means of delivering its message . " But no mention was made of the fact that Mr. Hammarstrom is an advertising manager and that the picture was actually the work of famed Rockwell Kent. * In naming Mr. Hammarstrom , the Harvard School of Business Administration had followed its usual custom of asking the winner ( i.e. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most worthy of honorable mention , and Marcus &; Co. had named Mr. Hammarstrom , had ignored Mr. Kent . <P> Disturbed was Artist Kent at this discrimination ; insulted was he by further developments . For Marcus &; Co. instructed Harvard to divide its award by sending a $500 check to Mr. Kent and a $500 check to Mr. Hammarstrom . Mr. Kent promptly returned the $500 . Said he : " I can not see that Mr. Hammarstrom is entitled to any recognition whatsoever . " Thereupon Mr. Marcus announced that the entire $1,000 was really the property of Marcus &; Co. and that Mr. Kent had been sent his $500 " purely as a courtesy . " Both checks were returned to Harvard with instructions to make out a single $1,000 check and send it to Marcus &; Co . <P> Since the award was for the advertisement " most effective in its use of pictorial illustration , " the jurors who made the award were unquestionably thinking of the drawing as a Kent , not as a Hammarstrom product . Had Marcus &; Co. argued that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no personal credit should be given , their position would not be in conflict with the Harvard Award system , which generally glorifies organizations rather than individuals . What chiefly troubles Mr. Kent ( and puzzles the advertising world ) is that , having decided to give personal credit , Marcus &; Co. put the laurel wreath upon the Hammarstrom brow . <P> The Marcus action may not seem important from the standpoint of establishing a precedent . Last year 's illustration award went to the Cadillac Co. , which gave recognition to Artist Thomas L. Cleland .
