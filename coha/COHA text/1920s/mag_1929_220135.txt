If anyone can keep a glider , i.e. , a motorless airplane , in the air for 20 hours , he can win a $3,000 prize and kudos ; for ten hours , $2,000 and cheers . Such were the offers made last week by Edward S. Evans , Detroit manufacturer and founder of the National Glider Association . <P> Twenty hours would be a feat indeed . The present record is 15 hrs. , made by a German . Germans have mounted 2,500 ft. , have traveled 42 mi. in gliders . They have glider clubs at practically all universities . Each year the clubs hold a grand rodeo over the rolling hills of Wasser-kuppe , near Frankfort-am-Main . German flying organizations require that their pilots be graduates of flying schools . There is a Deutscher und Segelfluguerband and a special periodical , Flugsport . <P> The aerodynamics of gliding is that of motored flight . First airplanes lacked motors . Otto Lilienthal , air pioneer ( anda German ) was killed by his glider falling . But few others have had serious accidents . <P> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain . Dune country , such as that near Chicago and off the Carolinas , is best for gliding . Knolls , ranges or terraces should slope toward the prevailing wind . One knoll should be 50 to 200 feet above all . And all should be bare of poles , trees , shrubs or other obstructions . <P> The glider is yanked into a 10 to 15 m. p. h. wind , which supplies lift . Thereafter it is the pilot 's job to jockey his plane upon the air currents ascending over the rolling terrain . Air usually rises to twice the height of an obstruction . If the pilot can get above a cloud he has an easy time . Wind always rushes up over the edge of a cloud . And the up-moving air is what the glider pilot wants . <P> Several glider clubs exist in the U. S. Important ones are at San Francisco and the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor . The one at the University has been most active among the colleges . <P> Some attempt has been made to use gliders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 ) . <P> A complete glider costs $500 in the U. S. But its parts may be purchased for $100 . <P> It is possible for a handy amateur to build a glider out of spruce or pine , wire , and fabric . Design is quite like that for a monoplane . ( One popular German model amazingly resembles a Lockheed-Vega . ) Wingspan may be up to 65 feet ( span of a staunch commercial Ford trimotored transport ) . But 25 feet is more practical for beginners . The National Glider Association at Detroit will furnish blue prints . However best advice warns against amateur construction , or patching together of old motored plane parts . <P> At the Ail-American aircraft show in Detroit early in April , glider jockeys are scheduled to show their skill .
