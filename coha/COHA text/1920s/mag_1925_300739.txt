IF I KNOW WHAT I MEAN-Elsie Janis-Putnam 's ( $1.50 ) . Elsie Janis was born in 1889 ; so she is not old enough yet to be writing memoirs . These are just a few essays thrown together in book form-her stage patter put in print . It does not stand the test very well . She is engagingly frank in her manner but not very refreshing . Her " platitudes and plongitudes " are done with the usual zest , but they do not get anywhere . They do not read much better than the stuff of a newspaper reporter trying to be " racy . " But those who love her on the stage will probably be satisfied with her in print .
