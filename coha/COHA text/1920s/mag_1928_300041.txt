Very placid is the river Housatonic as it winds through the Berkshire valleys . So even , so quiet is its flow that it is easily able to mirror the gentle , green elevations of ground which the Berkshire dwellers call hills , and which enthusiastic tourists like to call mountains . As gentle as the hills , as placid as the river , the Berkshire villages rise to break the pleasant monotony of the landscape . Their generous houses , most white and clean , front on broad streets with here and there a stretch of New England common . Their lawns slope gracefully to the languid river . Such a village is Stockbridge . <P> Stockbridge colonists like to tell the story of their new playhouse , where last week was held the 20th annual Stockbridge Art Exhibit . Twenty years ago , when Edward L. Morse , son of Telegrapher Samuel F. B. Morse , began the tradition of Stockbridge art exhibits , it was natural that he stepped-across the street from his own " White Lodge " to the Casino which stood opposite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Here , until last year , - Stockbridge artists displayed their wares . Dean of the colony , of course , was Sculptor Daniel Chester French . Every colonist , every tourist , knew his Minute Man at Concord , N. H. It was in his Stockbridge studio that he modeled the great Lincoln of the Memorial at Washington . The design of the Minute Man was accepted in 1873 . Last week , his daughter , Margaret French Cresson , viewed with pride his latest figure in bronze . It was called Whence , Whither , Wherefore . As chairman of the exhibition , Daughter could draw attention to Father 's fine mastery of detail . But she allowed others to point out her own bronze portrait bust of Commander Richard E. Byrd . <P> Next to the family of French , the family of Johansen has added most distinction to the exhibitions in the old Casino . Painter John Christen Johansen came first to Stockbridge to visit his good friend Walter Leighton Clark . Enchanted , he remained to colonize , paint . Great and friendly is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank with the foremost U. S. portrait painters , whose canvasses are held bargains at $5,000 . <P> Last week , Painter MacLane exhibited many a watercolor , and oil portraits of Mrs. D. Percy Morgan Jr. , and of 14-year-old Samuel F. Thomas , son of Mr. and Mrs. Finley Thomas of the Stockbridge colony . Sparkling , vivid with life , this portrait attracted particular comment . But some visitors preferred Painter Johansen 's study of his 12-year-old son . Not all visitors knew that Painter Johansen and Painter MacLane are man and wife . <P> Last year , a crisis came in the affairs of the Stockbridge art colony . Spinster Mabel Choate bought the property on which the Casino stood , and proposed to erect a memorial to her famed father , Lawyer-Ambassador Joseph Hodges Choate . She offered the Casino to anyone who would cart it away .
