Thick grey curtains of rain descended upon the northwestern corner of Wisconsin . All week they brushed the forests , slowly , monotonously . Everything dripped and the rust-colored road from Lake Superior to small Brule , the inland riverbank settlement , developed treacherous potholes despite the thousands of dollars Wisconsin had just spent to make it a safe road for a President to travel . An Army truck transporting mail-of-state foundered and tipped over . A light passenger car transporting a heavy , round-shouldered figure out of the dismal wilderness , slithered into a rut , stuck , had to be dragged out by horses . <P> The round-shouldered man was William Morgan Butler , outgoing chairman of the National Republican Committee . After leaving the dais at Kansas City , he had fulfilled his duty by calling on the holder of " the most important position in the world . " - In the wet woods , on an island , in a cabin , beside a fire , they had discussed politics scarcely at all , Mr. Butler said . They had talked about fishing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . He would not tell whether President Coolidge had caught any . He was going to Boston . The rain continued . <P> After Mr. Butler had gone , the Summer White House issued an announcement : President Coolidge had caught six fish , including a Loch Laven trout weighing 1 Ibs. and a Rainbow trout weighing 1 Ibs . <P> The Wisconsin conservation commission had appointed John La Roque , a half-breed ( Chippewa-French ) several years older than Calvin Coolidge , to be the official Coolidge fishing guide . Newsgatherers , barred from the damp fastnesses of the Cedar Island estate by iron gates and soldiers , got hold of Guide La Roque and questioned him . Thus spoke the red man : <P> " He uses dry flies and worms . He catches about fifty-fifty with the two baits . He fishes in the lakes and in the river and he catches the trout both places . He does n't talk very much , just when necessary . He never gets at all excited when he takes a good fish . He 's fine that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume was as follows : last year 's Western ( high-heeled ) boots , khaki trousers , khaki shirt , slicker , last year 's Western ( " ten-gallon " ) hat . <P> The rain turned to warm fog , then back to rain . President Coolidge did not visit his office in the high school at Superior . Col. Lindbergh was reported flying to Brule from Madison , Wis. , but he flew on over , landed at St. Paul . One newsgatherer got desperate and hired Carl Miller , a nephew of Guide La Roque , to paddle him seven miles down the Brule from a place called Stone Bridge . Past beaver houses , mink holes , deer licks , naked rampikes , swarms of mosquitoes and a military outpost , who carefully examined the voyageurs , the newsgatherer came to a thin hedge screening the river from a lake which it entered . Across the lake was a log cabin with a wet U. S. flag hanging over it . On the lake was a guide boat with a chair in it . In the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was watching trout come to the surface to snatch morsels of liver , their semiweekly rations . The surface of the lake was grey , desolate , broken . It was still raining . <P> Between acts , thoughts , dreams of fishing , President Coolidge gave his attention to an irreducible minimum of other matters .
