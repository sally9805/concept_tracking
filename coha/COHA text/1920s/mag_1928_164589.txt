" FUN-You are going to have . . . . GOLF , Yes Sir ! LUNCHEONS , EXHIBITS , PRIVATE ENTERTAINMENT-While it is not possible and would not be good form for the executive secretary to mention any of these affairs specifically , he is informed and believes ' on advice of counsel , ' that he should state that there are some very remarkable dinners , breakfasts and suppers planned , not to mention other most desirable features . . . ! ' and so to bed . ' " <P> Drawn on by this melodious invitation , a multitude of musical merchants gathered last week in Manhattan , at the comfortable Commodore . They wished to discuss business , the business of marketing musical instruments , from morning to noon and to amuse themselves throughout the rest of the day . Some of their frivolities were to be of a conventional nature . They were instructed thus- " As to entertainment , DO N'T FORGET Governor Albert C. Ritchie of Maryland , in line ... for president , will be principal speaker at the annual banquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erskine , president of the Juilliard School of Music . . . distinguished author of The Private Life of Helen of Troy . " <P> Both gentlemen spoke to the merchants . Said John Erskine : " Music should be taught , like history , in high schools . . . . There is great talent in the country . . . . The difficulty , however , is that the teachers are not in touch with the talent . " <P> Said Governor Ritchie : " We should have a national conservatory , an opera sponsored by the U. S. government . . . . Music is the one international language . We have the right to expect every great national government to aid and nourish it , and every one does , save only the United States of America . "
