From Paris he will go to London for more plaudits and a pleasant sight-a model of his plane prominently displayed in the historical aviation exhibit of London 's International Aero Exhibition , which the Prince of Wales opened last week . <P> The London show is remarkable for its great number of light planes . The transport and military planes there seem entered only as samples of what is being accomplished in aviation . The small planes are dressed up to stimulate sales . Many are being bought at sight . The Exhibition is a sales opportunity which U. S. manufacturers seem to have foregone . The only U. S. plane on show was a trimotored Ford . <P> U. S. aviation manufacturers , despite their scant representation at the London shew , have not been laggard in their foreign business . They sold abroad $2,485,070 worth of aircraft , $618,470 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of this year , according to a government compilation announced last week . The total , $3,990,050 , was almost triple the $1,461,328 aviation exports of the same months in 1928 . Canada , Mexico and Chile were the largest plane buyers ; Germany the largest buyer of motors .
