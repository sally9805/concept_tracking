world of poetry that is our own " ? what are these three poems ? They all are to be found in the " Cambridge Songs , " a collection put together at some time in the eleventh century , but all are earlier than that date . The first is " The Nightingale " by Fulbert of Chartres , who lived in the tenth century . This is a fresh and pretty poem in trochaic septenarii , somewhat recalling in form and spirit the warbling of the nightingale in the " Per ? vigilium Yeneris , save that in the ancient poem the music is in the minor key , with a note of pathos and world-weariness that some might like to call " modern . " I fail to see why Alcuin 's nightingale , included by Mr. Allen in his choir of Romanesque songsters , is not as full of the joy of life as that of Fulbert ? or why either piece may not be said to continue the ancient classical tradition , which is familiar enough with sad or jocund but ever-tuneful birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cen ? tury is the " Lam dulcis arnica venito . " This , too , is pleas ? ant verse , and " modern , " in Mr. Allen 's sense , in form , since one of the old meters used by Boethius has slipped from its quantitative leash and is done into lines of nine syllables which are indifferently long and short . The effect , to my mind , is crude and halting ; the writer has not acquired the easy grace of accentual verse ; he has merely dispensed with quantities . The subject ? an invitation to the poet 's loved one to join him in dining and wining and love ? is not unfamiliar in the odes of Horace , who is honored by the appropriation of one of his phrases . In ? deed , the poem rather closely suggests the Sabine bard 's last love-song to Phyllis , both pieces , as it happens , being set to music in different manuscripts of the tenth century . That which contains the " lam dulcis arnica " is assigned by Strecker to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written as prose -- an indication that this was not its first appearance . How much earlier was the date of its writing it were rash to guess . Far more exquisite in form and far deeper in feeling is the third of the trio , " Levis exsurgit Zephirus . " The verse is the simple iambic dimeter , used by St. Ambrose in his hymns , but here constructed on the rhythmical prin ? ciple . The plaintiveness of the poet , or poetess , " a heart ? sick girl ( or some clerk for her ) , " who sang " about the year woo " is as true as that in the priceless fragment that hundreds of years before recorded for all time the lone ? liness of Sappho . But again we must be cautious about the date of the medieval poem . It was written before the Cambridge Songs were compiled ? but how long be ? fore ? The sudden " Renaissance " of the tenth century becomes less sudden and less definite the more closely we try to focus our lenses upon it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great new birth has come . %Vhat is the matter ? The trouble lies , I believe , in an attempt to define literary species on the basis of spirit rather than form . There is plenty of romanticism , realism , pathos , subjectivity , intensity and the other qualities that Mr. Allen associates with " Romanesque " in the classic poets of ancient Rome . If imponderables can be weighed , the amount of such qualities that one could abstract from Lucretius , Catullus , Virgil , Horace and Ovid , to name no more , would vastly overbalance what appears in the late Latin and medieval poetry discussed in this book . If wit were thrown in , the " Romanesque " scale would kick the beam . One mark of distinction there is : it is between the artistic and elaborate and the simple and popular style . This distinction was patent to the ancient rhetoricians and is abundantly illustrated throughout the course of Greek and Latin literature ? and that of the Middle Ages from start to finish . We can do no better with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mark its periods by the historical epochs which give it its general coloring , and to recognize and applaud what is true in feeling and beautiful in form , whether simple or ornate , whenever it appears . Novelties will meet us all the way along ; and the strength of tradition will abide . I have done a great injustice to Mr. Allen 's book by devoting so little space to its real strength ? its breadth of scope , its flashes of inspiration , its sturdy independence , its sympathy with humanity , its perception of the human spirit struggling for utterance in ages that the historian too often passes over as dead . Nor is its author by any means blind to the virtues ? the Romanesque virtues ? of the Augustans or their precursors , Latin and Greek . There are fine passages on Virgil 's romanticism , on Cicero 's prose style , on Ennius ' obliteration of the earlier poetry , on Christian humanism , on civilization in Gaul and on other matters too numerous to record . Though we never lose the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indispensable companion for one who is following the course of Latin poetry in the Empire and the early Middle Ages . The Latin texts assembled at the end of the volume ? alas , with too many misprints ? constitute an attractive anthology of poetry , interpreted to the reader not only by the author 's comments , but by the remarkable renderings into English verse ? even better than the originals , at times ? by How ? ard Mumford Jones . These renderings are exact , with the larger exactness that aims to reproduce not words , con ? structions and meters , but sentiment , colorings and effects . In fine , nobody , not even a hardened classicist , can fail after reading this book to take a fresh delight in the poetry of the later Roman Empire and that of the early Middle Ages , or to he impatient for the sequel , in which we are promised the tale of Goliard Verse and Latin Minnesong . OLD cartographers had a modest way of drawing maps . They indicated the explored fringes of a continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incognita . With challenging and comprehensive titles such as " Understanding India " and " Living India , " readers have a right to know how far the authors have really explored , what they have understood , what they have added , if anything , to available knowledge . Gertrude Manvin ' Williams , after spending the usual five months in India , apparently in the winter of 1924 ? 1925 , covering the usual extensive mileage , has written the more or less usual superficial record of experiences and impressions . She devotes a good deal of space to trivial details of personal , but scarcely of general , interest . Whether her door would or would not lock in make-shift hotels , and the inconvenience of running short of money in Goa , where a Portuguese bank refused to honor an American letter of credit and a British Consul saw no reason why he should make a personal advance to the national of an ? other country , concern the author more than the reader . On the other hand , a lively procession of contrasting types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who lock sorrowful wives up in the zenana while they disport themselves in modern style at the races , or who hold magnificent durbars with elephants and be ? jeweled nobles . Indian officials , Nationalists , government clerks , untouchables , child brides , religious fanatics and half-wild jungle tribes beginning to drift to the steel mills and coal mines , move across her pages . There is a young Indian at a railway station at dawn , timidly begging her to sit on his bench under the veranda roof for fear that the dew would make her ill , whom one does not forget . How is the complex picture of visible India to be in ? terpreted ? Before the five months were up , Mrs. Williams had hit on a thesis , set forth in her preface . As she watched the panorama , the Indian scene took on a third dimension . She saw India projected in Time , but Time stretching backward , not forward . " Without being senti ? mental or blind to India 's failures , it is only just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is most severely condemned prevailed throughout the world until the last few centuries , and still exist in our own backward communities .... India , peculiarly isolated both by culture and position , has never broken the chains that bind her to the Middle Ages . " Guided by her sense of " an India slowed up by climate , by the inertia of age , by isolation but , underneath , of the same essential human stuff as ourselves , " Mrs. Williams confidently offers her key to un ? lock the door of our understanding . Give poor old India a little more time . It will not be long before she catches op with the rest of us . Do not forget that Europe and the United States have also practised child marriage , if to a lesser degree than India ; sanitation is only a hundred years old . An attempt to explain India only in relation to the West and western standards , and not in relation to her ? self , is obviously no explanation at all . Mrs. Williams is too much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp the essentials for India . She knows so little of Hinduism , for instance , that she thinks the sec ? tarian marks painted on the foreheads of many Hindus are " caste marks . " But what of the guiding ideals of In ? dian life ? Have thousands of years of experience taught India anything enduring , anything that need not suffer change under the impact of electricity , radio and the dis ? covery of germs ? Apparently not . According to Mrs. Williams , Christianity stands for something positive , Love . Hinduism stands for Renunciation , a negation . A Hindu might say his sages have taught that renunciation means giving up self , selfishness , and that real love only begins when this renunciation has been made . Looking at the women of India , Mrs. Williams is haunted by a line in an old Chinese poem , " How sad it is to be a woman . " In India women do not eat with men . Sometimes little girls may be seen carrying brothers al ? most as big as themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of " quaint pathos . " When the evil of child marriage and the tragedy of widowhood strike into the heart , the cup runneth over . Yet somehow , in spite of her misery , the Indian woman , in her own ideal of womanhood , rises phoenix-like out of the fire . " Education , suffrage , machinery to eliminate household drudgery , asepsis , the science of obstetrics ? our own emancipation ? are all very recent , " writes Mrs. Wil ? liams . How pitifully thin this " emancipation " would ring in the ears of the orthodox woman of India , illiterate , ignorant of what it means to vote , still bearing her childrenunder conditions of distressing hardship ! If she were brought face to face with the woman of the West , she would neither greatly envy nor admire her . For all her privileged position , the woman of the West , in the eyes of the woman of India , falls short of the ideal presented by the heroines of her own poetry and mythology and his ? tory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sakun ? tala , Gargi , who in their lives showed unflinching cour ? age , dignity , purity , steadfastness in love , unselfishness , perception of true values , glow with light undimmed by any comparison . Moral qualities transcend all others in the judgment of India . There is a bit of Indian wisdom hidden in the following little tale . A mosquito ? of unusual sensitiveness ? apolo ? gized to an old water buffalo , expressing the fear that he might have caused some annoyance . " Brother , " replied the buffalo , " bring your whole family , if you wish , and take up your residence on my horn . " Another India , the India in process of extremely rapid transition , is presented by Save1 Zimand . Here we have a penetrating analysis of conditions and trends of thought , leading up to just such a verification of the author 's ob ? servations as the recent Report of the All Parties Con ? ference , issued in August , while Mr. Zimand 's book must still have been in press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come so naturally and simply that there is apparently nothing startling in finding that India , too , has raised the familiar battle-cry . One needs to know India to grasp the extent of the revolution in thought now taking place , though it is not so much a revolution as a new application and di ? rection of an accepted principle . The passion for moksha , spiritual freedom , which sets an individual above the vicis ? situdes of his own fate and translates him beyond the inflexible laws of the phenomenal world , has possessed India for centuries . Intellectual freedom has also existed in India , unhampered by any sort of bigotry . Except during periods of foreign domination , people have always been free to believe and think as they pleased . With the excep ? tion stated , Indian history , as far as I know it , gives not one example of any great religious leader or thinker who was burned at the stake , or tortured or imprisoned for the particular view of truth he held or preached . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped down by iron-bound rules , regulating every detail of life from the manner in which a man is born to his final leave-taking . We are now seeing the effort of India to remake the social fabric , to discriminate between rules that have the sanction of higher wisdom and those that merely have the sanction of hoary antiquity . Pressure from without and from within is in process of creating new economics . In the political field , leaders are demanding that India be self-governing , in order to direct future evolution in line with the Indian vision , handed down from the past . It is a tremendous program of change , requiring , for its fulfill ? ment , the utmost of wisdom from India , the utmost of ' sympathy from the rest of the world . In order to give the proper focus for understanding the recent events precipitating the present mood of India , Mr. Zimand devotes several chapters to the structure of Indian society . Hinduism , caste , marriage , communal ten ? sion between Hindus and Mohammedans , are discussed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no hiding behind anonymous sources of information . He is obviously fair in his statement of facts , though some of his deductions or interpretations may be questioned . Are India 's appalling poverty and disease the actual re ? sult of the doctrine of Karma , that a man 's fate unwinds In accordance with his past deeds in this life or previous lives , and his consequent attitude of passive non-resistance ? Or are they due to the curious circumstance , or whatever it may be called , that India early took the road of intro ? spective investigation , searching out not the how but the why of this universe , while the western mind turned out ? ward and adopted the purely scientific method ? So far , western science offers no conflict with the truths arrived at by Indian sages , though it seems to stand at log ? gerheads with the accepted doctrines of the Church in the West . On the other hand , science has unquestionably given the West the mastery of material environment . India now has to learn how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of living . In her old field , that of perception of principles , of which scientiific truths are but a limited expression , she remains unchal ? lenged . Comfort and education , the multiplicity of things , India would answer her critics , profiteth the soul nothing . Mr. Zimand has touched on one vital point in his analysis of Hinduism . He says : " Great teachers of other religions have gazed upon the august vision and reported the divinity of the spirit . But only the Hindu seers heard whispered the secret that salvation is to be reached in life , not death . " Is this a depressing or pessimistic religion ? Mr. Zimand sums up , in his concluding section , the particular events since the World War , responsible for awakening national self-consciousness in India and giving to party leaders a new strength . The Amritsar tragedy in the spring of 1919 was the starting point of the Non ? cooperation movement , led by Gandhi . Mr , Zimand was present in Poona when , in 1924 , Gandhi was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Word of his release was brought to Gandhi while he was recover ? ing from a serious operation . With restraint and moving simplicity , the picture is drawn ? Gandhi being carried in a chair , too weak to stand , down the long corridor , between rows of men in white caps , white shirts , white dhotis , his devotees in homespun , whom he greeted with hands folded together in reverence . When his case was being tried , Gandhi had said : " I have no personal against any single administrator , much less can I have any disaffection towards the King 's person . But I hold it a virtue to be disaffected towards a government which in its totality has done more harm to India than any previous system . India is less manly under the British rule than she ever was before . " Some time after his release from prison , Mr. Zimand went to see him at the little fishermen 's village near Bombay where he was recuperating . Gandhi was asked to define noncoopera ? tion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he replied . " CoOperation with what is good implies non-cooperation with what is evil . " He had not changed his view , even though his movement had failed , and he still holds to it . It failed , perhaps , only in a technical sense . Gandhi has assuredly been the means of giving India a sense of national self-consciousness for the first time . We are led up to the threshold of India 's political eman- ? cipation . It has not taken place yet . There are some who insist that the time is still far off . Mr. Zimand no doubt discounts the strength of the conservative element , which numbers some important Indians , including , of course , the Indian princes , and he does not attempt to state the British position . Nevertheless , he has understood which way the wind is blowing , not the wind of caprice , but the wind of a people 's will . AFTER years of serene detachment from modern literature , Mr. More accepts the challenge of his younger contemporaries to illuminate their plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of the first order , and it is a challenge in its turn : the younger men will now have to make up their minds about Mr. More ; his attitude is unmistakable . The first thing to be observed in Mr. More 's analysis of the contemporary spirit is his lack of serenity , his impatient trick of presenting the opposition with straw men which he proceeds valiantly to knock down ; in this , it must be painfully admitted , he is surprisingly like that Absolute Demon of the Relative , H. L. Mencken . He seems , like a schoolmaster , to be peeved at the errors of the men who should have been his pupils , and he accordingly lays most of their mistakes to ignorance . Secondly , one observes that his diagnosis , merely as diagnosis , of the distress of the modern spirit is accu ? rate and profound : he tells modern writers unerringly what their moral deficiencies are , but he does n't seem to under ? stand why they behave as they do . Mr. More is a critic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has a theory of morals . That devil is the " Demon of the Absolute " who tells us that the meaning of life is in nature , human or non ? human ; he takes , consequently , two forms , which Mr. More aptly calls Pure Art and Pure Science . The doc ? trine of religious dualism , through which Mr. More ex ? poses the fallacy of the Demon , is too well known to re ? quire repetition here . It is similar to Professor Babbitt 's humanism , but it differs from it in one of the ways in which Plato differs from Aristotle ; Aristotle is positive and irreligious ; Plato is religious . Babbitt 's thought lacks a certain grandiose turn that More achieves through his abstract of Plato . More seems to speak through Plato ; he seems , again , to speak through American Protestantism . The point to be kept in mind in analyzing Mr. More 's attitude is its failure to assimilate the literal terms of any doctrine . ( Plato has no exact terms . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it becomes , in its vagueness , the vehicle of too much merely personal opinion which , not being responsible to the letter of a philosophical mooring , fails in comprehensiveness ; Mr. More repudiates a writer by means of a narrow personal distaste , and we are not reassured by the general sound ? ness of his views . In the present intellectual crisis , we require more than sound views . The vagueness of Mr. More 's philosophy of literature has permitted his response to literature to remain undis ? ciplined ; the tendency of indiscipline in any plane of ac ? tivity is to produce a repetitive mechanism of that activity . If a man so loses control of his total behavior as to let some single habit indefinitely repeat itself , the habit be ? comes self-perpetuating , mechanical . Mr. Mare 's habit of looking only for certain kinds of moral ideas has got be ? yond his control , and his judgment of literature is me ? chanical . This habit in Mr. More deprives him of two qualities indispensable to the critic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity of the truly philosophi ? cal mind , for his attempt to understand the last thirty years of literature is badly informed . He will have diffi
