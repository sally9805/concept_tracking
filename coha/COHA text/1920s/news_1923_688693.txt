txt The Turkish National Assembly at Angora has rejected the Lausanne Treaty , according to a Constantinople dispatch to Reuter 's . An official telegram from Angora , it is announced , stales that the Assembly gave its decision this afternoon that the draft treaty was unacceptable , as it was contrary to the National Pact . The Assembly disclaimed responsibility in the event of the powers insisting upon acceptance of the spirit and letter of the treaty . An important majority of the Assembly authorized the Government to continue its efforts for Peace under the following conditions : The Mosul question , being of vital importance , must be settled within a provisional period ; the financial , economic and administrative questions must be settled in accordance with the complete independence of the nation , and the occupied territories must be evacuated rapidly after the signing of Peace . It is quite unprecedented that a beaten foe should reject a treaty imposed by the victors , as the National Assembly at Angora has done . But the position of Turkey since the war , with the de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de jure Government in Constantinople until the latter had ceased to exist , the defeat of the Greeks by the Angora army and the latter 's threats to make war on the Entente  --  all these things have no analogy in history , and when the Angora Government was invited on Oct. 26 , 1022 , to send delegates to Lausanne in. order to negotiate a treaty of peace with the Entente and Greece , it accepted the invitation with the understanding that its delegates should have the same status as those of the nations called to meet them . They first met on Nov. 20 , and what happened on that day indicated the confusion which was to mark the conference , until on Jan. 31 , when the text of the treaty which had been agreed upon by the allied powers and Greece was presented to the Turkish delegates . The confusion continued . The conference finally broke down on Feb. 4 , on the definite refusal of the Turkish delegates to sign the treaty .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
