THE signs of tremendous agogging by members of the Monday Opera Club these days are the advance tokens , of course , of the possible visit to our shores of Queen Marie of Rumania . Miss Zoe Beckley , a newspaper sob sister who has shed sufficient tears in type to keep the alligator industry going for ten years , is arranging the affair . At the time of writing , Miss Beckley was concluding a two weeks ' tour of Her Majesty 's domains as the guest of the Queen , much discussion of details having gone on . More may he going on in Bucharest at this moment . Miss Beckley bids fair to become the greatest white elephant importer of our generation . She was Lady Astor 's liaison agent during her visit , and it is to her that the United States owes M. Coue and the " every day in every way " fad from which it was rescued by Mah Jongg and cross word puzzles . There is a ray of hope here ; maybe Her Majesty of Rumania will bring us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bargain counters of the chain drug stores . The Queen is understood to have been offered a contract with one newspaper to write her impressions of the United States . For New York City rights to the series , the price offered is truly regal , naturally , or about as much as Irvin Cobb gets for one short story , to wit , four thousand dollars . Considering the remaining markets for a syndicated series , it is evident that Her Majesty should be able to stop off for a shopping excursion in Paris on the return trip . What causes t h e agogging in Monday Opera Club circles is the memory of the graciousness of the Grand Duchess Cyril , who accepted reverence at ten dollarsthe bended knee . Her Majesty doubtless will not be less gracious , although perhaps the fee will be a bit higher . Say , twenty-five a curtsy , remembering that a reigning queen is worth more than a claiming grand duchess , and what with the old feudal retainers forming unions , and , such-like , and the general belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved to death was not Edinburgh , after all , but Bucharest . GEORGE JEAN NATHAN , it develops , is going to write a novel . Perhaps , for all one knows , he has already written one and published it under a nom de plume . Maybe " The Girl of the Limberlost " is his . At all events , he is at work on a new one . It is Mr. Nathan 's desire to write a novel and to engage in other creative activities which the present demands upon his time are said to make so difficult , that is said to he behind his decision to retire as coeditor of the American Mercury , beginning with the July issue . On the other hand , there are those who say thus and thus , but the official version is that his own writing interests have begun to prevail decisively over his editorial obligations . Nathan will n o t completely sever his connection with the Mercury and it is said that a title of Associate Editor has been found for him . He will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the fact that it has been kept secret until now , will know Nathan this Summer , and so he will probably have a new list of Teutonic names for the Fall and Winter critical trade . H. L. Mencken , upon the departure of Nathan , will be the sole editor of the Mercury . Thus , in July , 1925 , will a perhaps only temporary finis be written to a partnership in editorial direction that began on the Smart Set in 1914 . One sheds a tear . ROCK PEMBERTON , the producer , on the eve of presenting a play to New York , was discussing the Dobbs fire sale , explaining that he had waited forty-five minutes to buy a new shirt . " What , " said David H. Wallace , " do you want to buy a new shirt for You 'll only lose it next week . " AMONG press agents Ivy Lee is one of the few . who deserves the impressive title of " Director of Public Relations , " which the craft has adopted with wistful unanimity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that gay ray of light in the otherwise stygian darkness of the underground . He does n't edit it himself , any more than John D. Rockefeller peddles gasolene by the gallon , but his spirit is in it . One of the bright young men of the Lee organization does the immediate work . There are many such bright young men , of whom Mr. Lee is the field marshal . All " used to he newspaper men once themselves . " Every reporter who seeks information about any member of the Rockefeller family , or Mr. Vincent Astor , or the Standard Oil Company , must see Mr. Lee , or one of his representatives , and take what is handed out . The Interborough Rapid Transit Co. , too , is included in the list of the imposing persons and corporations in whose cabinets Mr. Lee holds the portfolio for Public Relations , at considerably above Washingtonian rates . His retaining fees are imposing . He does , to be sure , exercise a benevolent censorship . He says what is best for his clients , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abby Rockefeller should be arrested for speeding , in which circumstance the affair is beyond his control . One of the New York American 's brightest lights , Edward Doherty , lately learned how suavely Mr. Lee works . The Hearst paper had been informed that Miss Abby Rockefeller 's engagement to David Merriwether Milton , Jr. , was to be announced soon . Mr. Doherty was assigned to run the report dawn . When he leaped out of the dreary office on ' William Street he had in hand the makings of the best society news beat in many a day . Mr. Doherty went direct to the fountain head . He called at the imposing residence of young John D. , in West Fifty-fourth Street . Mrs. Rockefeller received him graciously . " Oh , yes , " she admitted , with rather disarming naivete , " it 's true . But we did not plan to announce it until Saturday . I have n't time to discuss the details , but you may get them from Mr , Ivy Lee . I 'll give you a note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee 's office . Yes , said Mr. Lee , it was quite true . Perhaps it would be better if he consulted Mrs. Rockefeller , checking up on the date of the marriage and such details . Would Mr. Doherty be so good as to call at the Rockefeller town house at six o'clock ? Mr. Doherty would . Meantime , many bright young men sprang to action in Mr. Lee 's office . Telephones jingled on every city desk in town , for if Mr. Doherty wanted a scoop , Mr. Lee was interested , in this specific moment , in seeing that the news was widely disseminated . So ; when Mr. Hearst 's reporter returned to West Fifty-fourth Street he found many fellows of his craft gathered in the great reception room of the Rockefeller mansion . At the appointed hour Mr- Lee gave out carefully exact statements to representatives of every newspaper in the city , and of every news association . The American 's scoop went glimmering . Mr. Doherty protested . He had had an exclusive tip . He resented having its exclusiveness destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever turning the other cheek . One suspects that whichever cheek he turned he may have had his tongue in it . THEY do say that up at Columbia University students in an American literature course took little interest in the announcement of " The Scarlet Letter " as prescribed reading . Later the professor added that it was the story of " How Hester Won Her A. " There was no further reluctance  --  Hawthorne got the job . THE English call it " swank . " In the Profession , that is , in the outer fringes of the Profession , it passes as " front . " What name Big Business has for it is uncertain , but surely it is no simple word of one syllable . The dentist who applied the psychology of the thing so successfully has not labelled the process , possibly because he is too well satisfied with the results . Perhaps because he deems it pure Genius , as it may be . He is a youngster , this dentist , out of college since the Armistice . He was struggling along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice gloss on his clothes as he sat along waiting for patients who somehow took their molars and bicuspids elsewhere . And how much sharper than a serpent 's tooth to a young dentist are friends already equipped with Carmichael bridges . He became disgusted waiting for something to happen , this young dentist , so he sold his equipment and his practice , in the order named , for five thousand dollars . Uptown , further , one of the most fashionable hotels in the course of remodelling , had provided a few professional suites . The young man rented one , paid most of his money as a first installment on elaborate furnishings and imposing machinery , and the hulk of the remainder to outfit two attractive young ladies as superlatively swanky attendants . Inquiries among his associates gained him the information that the most grasping of dentists , aside from the surgeon extractors , had not hitherto dared to charge more than twenty dollars an hour for their services . Calmly , he set his price at forty dollars an hour and within a month  --  reverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em away . His patients mostly are perfectly sweet and perfectly wealthy old ladies , who have nothing to worry about but their health ; and , surely , forty dollars an hour is not too much when one remembers that the young man is paid more for listening to symptoms than for any dental repair work he may do . He does little of that , anyway , arguing that since most of his patients are rapidly approaching their twilight , they do n't want oral improvements that can not be other than temporary . His major cares are not to inflict physical hurt on anyone ; and to be sure that the mulled wine and the excellent tea he serves each afternoon are to the tastes of the nice , old dears who so willingly pay him twice as much as anyone else in town has had sufficient genius to charge them . S the art deale-rs in New York survey the wreck- age , looking nervously about to see which point of the compass might bring the next cyclone , they devote their odd moments to calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , have to do with the hire of press agents . For all of them , we hear , have become firm believers in the genus press agent since the Zuloaga onslaught . Aside from the museum pieces , sold the first day , which totaled some quarter million dollars , there is the item of commissions for portraits . The noble Spaniard consented to do twenty fortunate Americans  --  no more . The price per portrait is said to he $15,000 . Figure it out for yourself  --  we make it $300,000 ! Fifteen thousand dollars seems a big price for a portrait but all of that is not velvet . First there is the commission to the dealer . Then the press agent must have his bit . The cost of the canvas is not to he hastily overlooked , either . A rapid calculation will give you a rough idea . A standing portrait , say : Nine feet of canvas will be necessary for the legs , another four for the torso and two more for the head . The dogs at the feet , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Everyone of course is not fortunate enough to have an Elsinore , even by marriage , for a background . But there is the packing plant , or the tire factory , or the oil derrick , and any of those heraldries will take up another five feet . That is a twenty-three foot canvas and canvas at $3.50 a yard . A hundred dollars would scarcely cover the paint , even at wholesale . Then there is the boy who carries the buckets around , handing up the stuff to the master on the scaffold . The items of garden hoes , trowels and airbrush machine seem small but should go on to the total . The twenty American women ( funny how we just assumed they were all women ) will have something worth remembering when they get their portraits . And they might as well remember this : The price each pays would support two good artists for a year , or say fifteen students for one year , or , properly used , uncover a dozen or more undiscovered geniuses . And a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Zuloaga was . Chewing gum , was it , or a new Volstead drink ? THROUGH one of the side streets in the middle GH off Fifth Avenue , came a youngster on roller skates , sufficient novelty in himself to attract attention , rattling along the sidewalks , where dusk had fallen and which the lull between homegoing and theatrecoming had left almost deserted . He stooped before one of the street lamps and poked at it with a large , square key . Opening a door in the cast-iron column , he turned a switch and at once a sputtering sounded overhead . The incandescent arc cast an uneasy blue pool on the asphalt , faint in the twilight . One wondered why a boy was making the rounds so . Until ten years ago all the great lamps on Fifth Avenue and in the neighboring streets were waked to duty by youngsters who made their rounds on roller skates , and shut off when day was flushing by the same boys . These youths were paid $3.5o weekly , and many an ambitious kid struggled to comparative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked up the lights to central switches and a choice field of endeavor was forever closed to boys .
