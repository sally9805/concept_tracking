Beware of Widows . Madge Kennedy has once more demonstrated her right to be known as a superlatively attractive person . Alexander Woollcott went so far in his commentary on the comedy as to call her the most charming person in Manhattan . As such she makes this play worthwhile . Shorn of her amazing personality it would be a slender , an insufficient venture . <P> Owen Davis is the author and it is not one of his best plays . He tells the story of a wilful and penetrating widow in love with a handsome and promiscuous doctor . Her efforts through the evening are centred on breaking his engagements to two other women and securing him for herself . All this occurs on a houseboat , which is wrecked just before the third act , to further her ambition . <P> Miss Kennedy is permitted to become slightly intoxicated in the second act in hilarious memory of her famous scene in Fair and Warmer . It is regrettable that the resemblance to that extraordinary rumpus stops short at that . Some day someone will write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole city will turn out with trumpets . <P> Just Beyond . It seems scarcely necessary to complain about this venture . It was a story of drought in Australia and closed after seven performances . <P> The Devil to Pay . The artistic and intermittently successful Stagers have picked a particularly dull piece for their second try of the season ( their first was A Man 's Man , one of the best in town ) . They took a play from the Dutch dramatist , Herman Heijermans , a play that has been exceptionally successful in Holland . <P> The play is primarily a picture of an ill-natured old woman , and for many months it was held by the Theatre Guild as a vehicle for their favorite actress , Helen Westley . Margaret Wycherly plays the part in the present production with quavers and acidity admirably suited to the crone . Whitford Kane is somewhat less successful as the old taxidermist , who is a greybeard Pollyanna . There is also a girl who is deceived by a strutting young musician and a serenely suffering mother . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mediocre domesticity had it not been so wearisome with words . <P> Morals . From Germany the Actors ' Theatre has drawn a creaky old satire of reformers and produced it with a fine cast in the high hope that it will divert a metropolitan public already much diverted by public moralists . The play employs the not unfamiliar device of staining the moralist with the very ink which he was bent on blotting from the city . <P> All deeply tangled in the net of one Madame de Hauteville , the Society for the Suppression of Vice in a provincial German town was about to be laughed out of existence by the delighted newspapers . Incited by one of the Society 's members , the police had made a raid and discovered evidence incriminating the very executive committee of the puritans . <P> Edwin Nicander as the Society 's president seemed a trifle overanxious on the opening night . The notable event of the evening was the advent of one Marian Warring-Manley , who has apparently never before acted professionally , in the considerable and exceedingly well played role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
