Fog off Nova Scotia last week made Captain David William Bone of the Anchor liner Transylvania uncertain of his bearings as he approached Nantucket , en route from Glasgow to Manhattan . He should have been over the continental shelf , the underwater plateau which extends 150 miles seaward from the North American coast . He ordered a sounding lead dropped . At 100 fathoms it should have touched bottom . It touched nothing . Twice more he sounded . No bottom . Although puzzled he decided that he was on his correct course and the Shelf might be out of place . Apparently last month 's earthquake ( TIME , Nov. 25 ) had opened a new hole in the bottom of the sea . <P> This inference was confirmed by ships which are repairing the quake-broken trans-Atlantic cables . Their sonic soundings showed that the ocean floor had moved and shifted the fishing banks . Because of broken cables and congestion of the unimpaired ones it was quicker last week to send many messages from London to Montreal eastward-via India , Australia , Fanning Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
