DEATH OF A YOUNG MAN-W . L. River-Simon &; Schuster ( $2 ) . " These are the papers of my young friend David Bloch . . . . Perhaps he was dying . He did not wait to see . " Author River , after this introduction , delves into the mind of his young friend to discover therein the peculiar changes that occur when dying ceases to be an abstract and impossible conjecture , and when it becomes instead a positive and immediate thing to be done , like eating breakfast . David Bloch develops a paradoxical sensitiveness to stimuli ; the two girls he liked , his friends , even his own senses , his most trivial actions become vastly important by their relation to death . In precise and beautiful language , Author River , a young man whose first book this is , explores so thoroughly that he makes no attempt to solve what is the most astounding question , the most unbelievable fact .                   @ @
