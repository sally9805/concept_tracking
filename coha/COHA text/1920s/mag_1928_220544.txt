An owl perched disapprovingly , last week , on the locomotive of the Leningrad-Vologda express . The engine began to chuff . The owl hunched down and fixed two luminous , menacing eyes upon the smiling engineer . <P> Roaring now , the express touched 50 miles an hour . Wind blown , the owl sought support by hooking a long sharp claw into the mechanism of the air brake . Instantly the valves tripped , setting all brakes . Passengers pitched higgeldy piggeldy from their seats , cursing . The owl , its claw caught in the tripped mechanism , was captured , disentangled and preserved alive by the kindly engineer . <P> <P> Commissar ( Minister ) of Health N. A. Semashko dolefully reported last week that Russian peasants privately distill " at least 140 bottles of samogon ( moonshine vodka ) for every bottle which they buy from the Soviet Spirits Monopoly . Irate officials of the Monopoly estimated , last week , that " 30,000,000 buckets of samogon are illicitly distilled each year . " By " a bucket " they declared that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural population of the Soviet Union numbers some 117,000,000 , the con sumption of samogon would work out roughly at only bucket ( or 5 bottles ) of these potent , whisky-like spirits per peasant per year . <P> <P> Correspondents cabled from Moscow , last week , the following price quotations on necessities for tourists : 1 ) Room &; bath $10 per day , increasing to $12.50 when the cost of both water and taxes are added ; 2 ) Table d'hote lunch or dinner $2.50 up , with a luxury tax of 10% ; 3 ) Cigarets 23 to 75 per package of 20 ; 4 ) Razor blades of U. S. make $1.50 each . <P> While the prices apply for those who must live in hotels , a Russian family with several children can live fairly well at home in Moscow for $2 per day .
