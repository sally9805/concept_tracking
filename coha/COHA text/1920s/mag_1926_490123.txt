WE have had an opportunity to observe first hand the progress of Mr. Volstead in his effort to institutionize law-breaking . In a side street far east the other day we saw a boy aged about four years carrying with great difficulty five milk bottles filled with water . " My ! " exclaimed an old gentleman who was passing , " that 's a load ! What are they for ? " " They 're gin , " he explained , " I 'm playing bootlegger .

Our glance wandered into that hall of Spanish grandeur wherein are the local headquarters of Coral Gables . Everyone within the establishment was grinning happily . THE soft coal smoke situation is at last beginning to occasion some comment and criticism . Our personal observation , which necessarily is limited to certain quarters and may therefore be unjust , has been that office buildings and such are not the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York University is just as bad . The daily press has impressed us with the fact that smoke means wasted coal and we have con-eluded that since these institutions are not money-makers , they do n't care . AFTER refusing with difficulty the repeated requests for money on the part of rich-looking , loftyspoken representatives of the more cultured kind of charity , we snarled at a Salvation Army man who visited our secret dwelling . He smiled and said , " I know . We all feel that way sometimes , do n't we ? " and went about his work . We endorse the Salvation Army and next time we will have a check for it . AN amusing enough thing has hap-pened in banking circles . Going into our counting house we noticed that the vice-presidents were all decorated with buttonhole gardenias . So impressed were we that we went up to the one we knew and asked him the reason . " It 's because we have so many lady depositors now-a-days , " he explained a little sheepishly .

A GOOD STORY has been retailed by the passengers of the Mauretania . It seems that the gigantic liner stopped at a small southern port on a winter cruise , occasioning the most appalling amount of excitement among the natives . The Captain of the little tender which came to take the passengers off almost burst with importance . He brought his boat alongside most pompously , shouting orders in Italian , and doing everything wrong . Three times he tried to make connection with the Mauretania 's gangway , and three times failed . The first time the Mauretania 's captain smiled ; the second time he looked serious ; and the third time his face became contorted with fury , " Stand by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bring my ship alongside . " Anglo-American CROWDS to see the Leverhulme collections continued unabated all this week and during our most recent visit the Anderson Galleries were puz-zling over what to do with the hundreds of applicants for admission to the auctions which begin February thirteenth . It will be impossible to ac-commodate everyone , even though the waIl between auction and reception rooms is being torn down , thereby throwing them into one . So local art dealers applying for " a dozen or so seats for customers " are being refused . Certainly the sale of the art collection offers great possibilities to those rare people who know what they want . Whether Americans will appreciate the true value of certain essentially English pieces is a moot question , some connoisseurs contending it would have been better , even from a financial standpoint , to have offered them for sale in England . There are , for instance , numerous small and exquisite pieces of Stuart and Queen Anne needlework which in London would undoubtedly bring perhaps six or seven hundred dollars each . That such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole collection of furniture , tapestries , and china is very English . Only twice in these collections , it is said , did the collector go without his field  --  once when he bought his famous Chinese porcelains , and again on seeing two pieces of French furniture so perfect in workmanship as not to be resisted . L " URTHERMORE , the late Lord 1 ' Leverhulme , who began his career with " Sunlight Soap " and later graduated to " Lux " , was an eminently practical man . In fact it was this admirable trait , they say , which won for him the friendship of Queen Mary who recently requested to have one Last look at his home before it was dismantled . He never bought , for instance , a stick of furniture which was not to be actually used . In his famous home , The Hill , at Hampstead , he even installed an American system of heating . Little did the soap magnate dream this would aid the American sale of his cherished possessions . For in America the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case when transferred from cold , damp , English houses to the centrally heated homes over here . The question of whether America or England is a better market for some of the Leverhulme collection may be considered in connection with the impulse of several of the leading London art dealers to visit New York during the sale . " Is this a coincidence " Certainly not , " reply certain of their patriotic fellow-countrymen who suggest that the sale is being held in this country because of low prices offered collectors in England through the manipulations of a so-called " London art dealers ' ring " . This time , say the critics , the eminent dealers may learn a lesson , after purchasing at fair prices not only the objects they covet but , in addition , round trip tickets across the Atlantic . SOME of the Leverhulme pieces , in-cidentally , have already been bandied quite a bit back and forth between England and America . The drawings by Flaxman , for instance , were bought in England by Charles Elliot Norton , of Harvard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston . They were returned to England and bought by Christie 's , and from Christie bought by Leverhulme to be again sent to America . With the arrival of the British dealers , they may take another ocean trip . Jig Saw THERE has unquestionably been a boom in jig saw puzzles this winter and those who have helped to further it , especially , will be interested in the experience of Mme. Alla Nazimova , who went , recently , to Atlantic City in search of rest and recuperation . Her trouble arose when she bought a huge jig saw puzzle on the boardwalk . It contained t500 pieces . Madame spent her waking hours for three long days trying to fit the devilish thing together . She ordered her meals sent to her suite and ate them fitfully ; she slept in snatches and was up again to wrestle with her problem . At last , in despair , she gave up . For nearly twenty hours she had been down to the last dozen pieces , but somehow or other she could not arrange them properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep chair , from the wide sleeves of her kimona three more pieces of the puzzle dropped impishly onto the floor . A moment later the entire fifteen hundred pieces rattled viciously on the boardwalk . Broad A CRATCH the Russian and under- neath you 'll find the Tartar .

Dial Difficulfies A YOUTH who , albeit he is quite la successful author , has kept the whimsical and charming sense of humor that he inherited from his mother , tells me he is compiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list  --  and he was full of it that day  --  is the finding of names for telephone exchanges . It sounds easy but is n't . There is a very important Naming Bureau , with research experts who pore over tomes . Incredible though it may seem , says our friend , this same Naming Bureau recently went through histories and geographies of New York and lists of local surnames and compiled 00,000 names of suitable length . Of that roo , 000 , only 183 turned out useful . The other 99,817 failed to meet the requirements of the dial mechanism and the ear of the operator . Incredible but true . For instance , Parkway and Barclay would be indistinguishable to a central ; and Cortlandt and Amsterdam would conflict on the dial , Cor and Ams being in the same three jiggers . It is of course a sign that the naming authorities failed in their hunt for local names that we have such exchanges as Trafalgar and Yellowstone . And now they have to think up two more names for exchanges that will be opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future they will have to think up probably a hundred names ; that is if the city grows as fast in the next twenty years as it is growing now . And it is up to those few men to save us from such names as Chicago , Florida , etc . They put words into our mouths , they make the legendary quarters of the city of five hundred years hence . May their consciences be their guides . WE heard a statement the other day that the dial will not he universal hereabouts until 1940 . It will be by then , barring earthquakes , but what with the rapid growth of the city , it will take that long . And there is no necessity for sympathy for the operators even then . None at all . There are more silver-voiced centrals today than ever before and their number will increase , this owing to the fact that the growth of the toll calls requires more operators than are released by the dial . S. A. AIR . SHUBERT 'S press depart-ment has been amusing New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking them to judge the comparative sex appeal of young ladies of the Shubert chorus . The letter begins with the bald question " What is sex appeal ? " And the contest to be held is to settle the matter for once and for all . We generally hear it defined as something that breaks hearts  --  which recalls an old Hollywood story , Mr. Ben Turpin and a young gentleman also in the comedy profession were engaged in their antics when an unhappy remark passed between them . Voices were raised ; the pie throwing ceased to be in jest , and Mr. Sennett himself was hastily sent for to quell the disturbance . " What the devil 's the matter ? " roared the master , as he arrived . " I leave it to you , if I ai n't a right to fight him , " said Turpin ( he is the one of the crossed eyes ) , his voice breaking with emotion . " He says he has more sex appeal than I have . " Social Fashion Q EVENTEEN hundred parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hundred odd children who appeared in the annual Children 's Fashion Show at the Hotel Astor last week have pronounced the affair a tremendous success . But we are told that the worthy wholesale merchants who underwrote the entertainment are not so sure . The show was engineered to become more or less of a society event , and to awaken parents that the lapel cut of Johnny 's coat is every bit as important as Mother 's evening gown . There is no denying that the affair was colorful and many of the girls ' costumes gorgeous ; but the enthusiasm of the audience got all mixed up and the donors had to content themselves with such comments of appreciation as " Oh Johnny ? " " There 's Mary , is n't she ducky ? " " That 's my son there . " " Hello Miriam ! " etc . So it is whispered that fashion shows are to he confined to the adults , for the near future , at least . ? AMOST interesting example of cunning propaganda is reported by Mr. David H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . The barber was more than usually polite , but there was nothing unusual about his conversation until he contrived ( there is no question in Mr. Wallace 's mind that he was deliberately trapped ) to draw from his customer the mild observation : " You find this shop a good place to work , then ? " " Ah , yes , " said the barber . " A wonderful place . Yes , sir . Why , a dollar tip is nothing around here . " Cheekbones EVEN while , a few weeks ago , we went to some lengths to explain Mr. Seward 's legs and how they happened ( his head having been placed upon Lincoln 's body to please an incumbent of our city hall of several deCades ago ) we remarked that New York statuary , on the whole , seems a matter of exceedingly little interest to anybody . Yet , since we touched on the Seward matter , our desk has been swamped with correspondence giving the grisly details of the others . The latest comes from Darien , Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given the high cheekbones of an American Indian . While it is accompanied by all sorts of substantiatory statements , we prefer to leave the burden of proof on the gentleman in Connecticut . He asserts that the head is made of separately cast bronze plates , and that in the course of their assembling the workman , who were putting it together from blueprints , got mixed up , and that the Goddess ' cheekbones are really her jaw-bones inverted . Decoys ? BROADWAY is familiar enough with the kindly-faced , middle-aged decoys  --  known to the trade as " shills " ? who sit eternally in empty sight-seeing buses , coaxing , by their presence , the reluctant passerby from Dubuque into boarding the bus . Their being middle-aged makes their presence more effective , for the provincial does not need to be enticed onto the lumbering autos ; what he needs is assurance . Mostly , one learns upon discreet inquiry , these decoys are broken-down actresses , who find the employment not altogether unpleasant as a means of sustaining life . Say what you will about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own . Lately some of these decoys have found a means of adding to their earnings , in the service of the movies . In addition to carefully coached supers  --  each one a type  --  they are employed for the screen premieres of great stars . As first flicker time approaches , they mill about the theatre entrance . Some have coats into which the sleeves have been basted with few stitches . The slightest tug detaches them . It is a very effective bit , invariably . " Look at that lady 's sleeve , " say Mr. and Mrs. Great Public , much impressed . " Torn right out of her dress . " Preponderant evidence of the immense popularity of the star whose latest antics are about to be exhibited . It makes excellent reading in the press reports of the event next day . And , they say , just a few minutes ' milling by the supers will induce the passing public to supply its own riot . co THE OCCASIONAL DRIVER , whose car pops in and out of storage , may appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lights . Park Avenue 's signals are going northward to Ninety-sixth ; Seventh has the winking towers to Twenty-eighth now , and they are being extended to Fifty-ninth ; with a few weeks Madison will be included to Sixty-fifth ; and First Avenue , too , has undergone erection of the lights . And that , for the time being , is all . Current History ADEFINITE date for the doom of the Astor mansion is finally set . On May first its title changes hands . It was in this house , as everyone knows , that Mrs. William Astor and Ward McAllister one day dis covered that the ballroom was not large enough to accommodate all the guests intended . History does not tell us if the same discovery was ever made with regard to the pictures . But guests , after all , are much easier to delete than pictures and a pruning process ensued , down to the neat sum of four hundred . When asked by the press the reasons for this cutting , McAllister replied there was nothing particularly drastic about the list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , rephrased , was heralded far and wide by the press , giving rise to the term " Four Hundred " . That Mr. McAllister never said , " There are only four hundred people in New York really worth knowing , " as has so often been attributed him , is certain . But in those days , as today , it was a good press story and the papers made the most of it , with the consequent result that thousands of present day New Yorkers are irrevocably doomed to go through life collectively compressed into the term " Four Hundred " , and thus incongruously described by their fellow countrymen of Salt Lake City and Waco , Texas . NOW the house in which the deed was drawn is to come down and in its place , as an everlasting memorial to commemorate the event , shall rise  --  the Temple Emanu-El ! Let those hardy souls , however , who still have strength enough to bemoan the passing of the good old times and the gracious days of private homes save some of their tears for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 8-13o East Eightieth Street , for which the wrecking has already begun . SEVERAL hundred friends were invited the other evening to bid the old house good-bye , and until four in the morning satin slippers trod its floors preparatory to its closing . Among the treading slippers , though not of satin , were those of the debonair mayor , Jimmy Walker . This is the first time in eight years , we are reminded , that a New York mayor has been considered socially eligible . An interesting conversation was overheard the other evening at the Astors 's in a corner of the music room between a New York lady and an English guest . " That 's the Mayor of New York , " said the New York lady . " But I thought , " hesitated the English lady , " I thought he was n't ever asked anywhere . I thought he just owned everything here  --  the parks and playgrounds and streets and  --  and all that . " " Oh , gracious me ! This is Mayor Walker ! " exclaimed the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom the Actors would never have dared to ask . Do you know what would happen if they had ? Well , the next morning bright and early there would have been a large sign right across the front of the house ? MAYOR HYLAN 's AsTo " . ? IT IS Mr. Patterson McNutt who I unquestionably leads in this year 's search for the world 's greatest  --  or , should it be smallest eriority complex . He observed a gentleman who approached a theatre box office and inquired , meekly , if it would be possible for him to buy two seats in the last row of the second balcony for a week from Monday night . &amps; D UT for the providential activities of the parcel post , we might never have known that a Woodrow Wilson Memorial stamp had been issued . It is of a denomination for which the casual citizen has little use seventeen cents  --  and we were led thereby to speculate whether it was reasonable to expect what an editor might term " better position " in the treatment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inquiries , we began to doubt the fairness of our suspicion . The first issue of the Wilson stamp was 2 i , 000,000 copies , or , roughly , a stamp per voter , which seems generous enough . The color is black , which was also the tinting of the Harding Memorial stamp . This was Mrs. Wilson 's choice ; as was also the portrait used , which was made in the late president 's first administration . He approved a different pose for the national archives . THE familiarity of stamps in our daily lives undoubtedly detracts from our appreciation of the really excellent engravings done fur each issue and the infinite detail connected with their preparation . There are specialists in the Bureau of Engravings for the frames , for the lettering and for the vignetting . The portraiture is done usually by Mr. James Smillie , an engraver who has spent a lifetime in Government service . The work of Frederick Remington has been more largely used on stamps than any other American artist , due , of course , to the many successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread governmental use of his work was during the Omaha festivities , a few years ago . And Coins ODELS for coins do not come VI so largely from general art sources , it seems , since there is a group of sculptors who specialize  --  and prosper  --  in providing the sculpture for public buildings and from whom the Treasury Department draws most of its original inspirations for minting . Thus , it will not mean much to the public generally to purvey the information that the dime and half-dollar owe their origin to Mr. Adolph Weimann , that Mr. Hermon MacNeil is responsible for the quarter , and that the almost-forgotten silver dollar was designed by Br . Anthony Francisci . The lowly penny however strikes a spark among the oldsters , who will recall the furore some years ago when the first of the copper coins with Lincoln 's head thereon also bore the initials of the sculptor , Mr. Victor D. Brenner . Quite a few of the V.D.B. pennies were saved for long years in the hope of great appreciation in value when the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen but rarely between Christmas-tides ? the twenty , dollar gold piece is perhaps the love-liest among our mintage , leaving out of consideration intrinsic value . It was done by Augustus St. Gaudens . The buffalo nickle , also , was the work of a non-specialist in the coin field . M1 James E. Fraser designed it , who will be remembered by the religious as the sculptor responsible for the effigy of Bishop Potter in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , and by the war veterans who applied for their rewards as the artist who modelled the Victory Medal . ? WE ARE ABLE to report that the movement for Sunday shows has reached a point where it is reasonably safe to predict that they are to be . The Actors Equity Association has agreed , with the solemn proviso that its members are guaranteed a full day off each week . Now the managers are trying to reach an understanding as to what date they will darken their particular houses . Tuesday , being the leanest , is the night most sought . This difficulty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the way of the necessary law revision at Albany but the Gospel Alliance , which has n't as much influence as it once had .
