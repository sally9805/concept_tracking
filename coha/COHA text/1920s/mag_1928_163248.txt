North . Two years ago last week volatile , voluble General Umberto Nobile of Italy , accompanied by his fox terrier bitch Titina ; sturdy , silent Roald Amundsen of Norway ; able , adventurous Lincoln Ellsworth of the U. S. flew in the dirigible Norge over the North Pole . Seventy-one freezing hours of flight cooled the entente cordiale between the Italian and his companions . Last week the Italian took off from Kings Bay , Spitsbergen , accompanied almost entirely by Italian scientists and an Italian crew , in the dirigible Italia , to explore the unknown regions around the North Pole for the glory of Mussolini and his Fatherland . <P> Leaving Kings Bay the Italia sailed over a freely moving sea , unhampered by ice ; headed north over the Franz Josef Archipelago for Tepliz Bay . Here the Sella Polare , the Duke of Abruzzi 's ship , once wintered , here Francesco Querini heroically lost his life in the Cegni polar expedition of 1909 , here in loyal commemoration Nobile dropped a symbol of St. Mark upon the ice . Low over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into a head wind , its speed cut to 40 miles , ice forming on its sides . Gradually the air cleared , visibility improved . Lenin Land , discovered by the Russians 15 years ago , was the next objective . General Nobile hoped to land a scientific party on Lenin Land but so thick was the falling snow , so menacing the cold and dreary waste , that after hunting in vain for a sight of the land , the project was abandoned and the Italia 's nose pointed toward Spitsbergen . <P> South . An organization called Byrd Aviation Associates was formed last week to give " moral and material support " to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd 's expedition to the Antarctic , scheduled for September . Charles Evans Hughes is chairman ; Edsel Ford treasurer .
