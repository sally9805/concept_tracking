( See front cover . ) <P> Last week was Smith Week among the Democrats . East coast , West coast , all around the land , the Smith candidacy seemed to have reached a new high-tide line . In Washington , a Southern Senator who would not permit his name to be quoted because he and his State have been thoroughly anti-Smith , said : " Smith already is nominated . " Other Washington politicos were discussing , not the probability of the nomination but its manner . Perhaps , they said , it could be managed by acclamation , which would be a very good thing for the chances of the Democracy in November , the precise reverse of much-haggled , half-hearted 1924 . <P> In Manhattan , having bided its time , the Democratic State Committee formally offered New York 's " most distinguished son " to the nation . The chief speechmaker used the words " progress " and " progressive " nine times in ten paragraphs , and made the customary references to Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln .

Here , really , was a crux of the Smith candidacy which its supporters were taking on a surprising amount of faith . The California primary , first direct contest between the leading candidates , is of great importance psychologically as well as numerically . California is farthest from New York . California contains a curious mixture of wet Protestants , dry Catholics and vice versas . Thousands of Republicans were registered to vote in the Democratic primary . To predict a decisive Smith victory in California the margin of 10,000 votes quoted last week by Smith men seemed inadequate , senseless . Behind Candidate Walsh is William Gibbs McAdoo . Behind Candidate Reed is William Randolph Hearst . Behind Candidate Smith is onetime ( 1915-21 ) Senator James Duval Phelan , locally no less potent than McAdoo or Hearst but not clearly the Democratic strong-man of California able to combat the other two and confound them by division .
