The Communist Party of America has dissolved and has directed its members to join the Workers ' Party , the legal , or " above ground " section of the organized American Communist movement , according to a statement issued by Charles F. Ruthenberg , former Secretary of the " underground " Communist Party , and now on trial for criminal syndicalism in Michigan . <P> The Department of Justice declares that the dissolution is " only a trick to fool the workers and permit the Communists to operate with less danger of imprisonment . " " The Communists may have given up their illegal party , " said R. J. Branegan , " under cover " man in the Department of Justice , " but they have not given up their organization . That is to say , the nucleus of revolutionists who controlled the illegal party remain in control of the Workers ' Party , and retain their affiliation with Moscow . "
