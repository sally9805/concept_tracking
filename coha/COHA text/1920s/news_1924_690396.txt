txt Net earnings of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway for the year should be about 10% on the common stock , said Edwin Gould , chairman of the board , sailing on the Gunarder Aquitania , to The Wall Street Journal . " We earned 14% on our common last year , but we wo n't do quite so well this year , due to the uncertainty in the political situation . " Our business for the first six months of this year was about 20% off from the corresponding period of last year , due to this period of business recession . but Our best months are ahead of us . We always do better in the last half of the year than we do in the first . The directors and friends of the road are thoroughly satisfied with the earn , ings and we expect the last half of the year to take care of the falling off in business in the first half . The crops along our route are in good condition and should give a good yield . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
