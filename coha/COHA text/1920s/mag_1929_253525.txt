The largest city of Marshall County , West Virginia , is Moundsville ( pop . 12,000 ) , on the Ohio River . One of the most important preachers of Moundsville is Dr. Donald M. Grant , of the First Presbyterian Church . <P> Last week Dr. Grant achieved far more fame than theretofore he had won in shepherding his Moundsville flock . His name appeared in big-city newspapers all over the U. S. Many an editor wanted to publish his face . But they had none of his photographs . Therefore they did the next best thing and published pictures of the man he assailed-Bishop Francis John McConnell . newly elected President of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America , successor to the Rev. Dr. S. Parkes Cadman ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) . <P> Dr. Grant viewed Bishop McConnell with pious but vigorous alarm . In fact , he said , he would like " to set in motion an effort that will speedily rid the Council Federal Council of Churches of such a dangerous leader , or to insist upon our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Grant wrote in the Presbyterian , a weekly published in Philadelphia . And the Presbyterian 's editor , approving , added : " The hearts of real Presbyterians had rather grown accustomed to be saddened by the utterances of Dr. S. Parkes Cadman , who until recently was President of the Federal Council of Churches . It was hoped that his successor would be a man whose utterances would at least be in harmony with the teachings of evangelical Christianity . <P> " But these hopes were dashed when it was learned that Bishop Francis J. McConnell of the Methodist Church had been chosen ( unanimously ) as President of the Council for the next four years , as this action seems to make certain that the matter , instead of going from bad to better is going from bad to worse-if that be possible . " <P> The Federal Council of Churches consists of representatives of 28 Protestant denominations . It has a constituency of about 20,000,000 members . Bishop McConnell 's fame as a religious leader rests largely upon his battles for better labor conditions in Pittsburgh mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels . Recently he posed the ticklish question : " Is not this tendency to deify Jesus more heathen than Christian ? " Bishop McConnell seemed to think it was . Dr. Grant , shocked , responded with another question : " If that is Bishop McConnell 's position , then the thing that concerns me as a Presbyterian minister is , how can our Presbyterian Church consent to remain in the Federal Council while such a man remains President thereof ? " <P> Dr. Grant 's question remained last week unanswered .
