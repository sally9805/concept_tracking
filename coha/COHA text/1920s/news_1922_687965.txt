txt A Wayside Carnation . To the Editor of The New York Times : I am not a commuter who has flowers to leave at the Grand Central station for the poor and sick of the city . I have no garden ? urban , suburban , or rural . But if I could properly present to the mind's. , eye of the more fortunate a little picture which has long dwelt in my memory it would surely induce them to respond to the appeal of the Plant , Flower and Fruit Guild . One day on the curbstone of a crowded block on upper Broadway somebody had dropped a carnation  --  short of stem but still fresh and vividly red . As it caught my eye so it caught the eye of a newsboy , barefoot and ragged , grinning with business eagerness . As he darted to pick up , the flower his grin changed to a look of ecstasy . Business forgotten , he tucked his papers under his arm and sped down a side street , skillfully threading his way through the crowd without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnation which one hand held out in front of him while the other , carefully curved around it , shielded it from possible harm . Where was he taking it ? To some den of his own for his own delighting ? To a sick mother ? To some specially favored , pigtailed " goil " ? One could only guess . But whoever saw him with his forgotten papers , his flying feet , his stemless blossom and the look on his face can never since have doubted that it is worth while to share what a garden gives with city children and their elders . It was long ago . The little boy must be a man by now . But I am sure . that he too remembers that precious , that wonderful , windfall . I hope he has since had many , of floral and of other kinds . Evidently he deserved them . M. G. ' VAN RENSSELAER . New York , July 28 , 1922 . High Laundry Prices . To the Editor of The New fork Times : The letter in today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trade , in which he attempts to excuse the present excessive laundry prides , may be convincing to himself but it is far from convincing to the consumer . The present prices are . too high , and if , as Mr. Walder seems to think , they are to be maintained , the family habits will need reform and the home kitchen must compete . Why must a sheet be 10 cents and other " flat work " in comparison , no matter what " system " is used ? And that question of " systems " is interesting . One can not name them all , for there is a new " one born every minute . " We have " wet wash , " " rough dry , " " finished , " " semi-finished , " all with variations and a sliding scale of prices . As soon as the housewife gets accustomed to one " system , " notice is given that a new or better system has been evolved . Who in these days ever saw a printed price list that was final ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 cents up " or never adhered to . No : the industry is not giving the housewife the best service , and it is quite too bad , for the commercial laundry could have all the family wash if prices could be fair , loss eliminated and good service given . It would be advantageous if the owners could once pull together and standardize prices and systems . As matters now stand . it will be well for the home manager to know her laundry well , to insist upon money value for loss , to acc.pt no one else 's sheets , for her own and to demand a fair price , or let the old-time laundries compete . JENNIE DEWEY HEATH . President National Housewives League . New York , July ' 26 , 1922 . The Typist 's Arm .. To the Editor of The New York Times : I would like to know what would be the scientific position for the arm of a typist , whether the upper arm should be down or slant forward a little ( or considerably ) , and whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or slant down or up a little ( or considerably ) , My reason for asking is that I have had a Blight pain in the elbow Joint for some time . If the position of the arm was the cause , I would be glad to keep the pain from developing . AGNES J. CLARK . Providence , R. I. , July 26 , 1922.
