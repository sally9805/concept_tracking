As it must to all men , Death came at Sewickley , Pa. , last week , to a 69-year-old millionaire who had risen from a small stained glass maker to be the largest plate-glass manufacturer in the world . He was on boards of great banks , Mellon National , Federal Reserve , was director of a Bell Telephone Co. , trustee for Pittsburgh 's Associated Charities , president of national trade associations . Yet all his life he was a sailor-man at heart , romantic , adventurous . Captain Charles William Brown , son of Jacob B. , typical New England Ship Master , went to sea out of his native Newburyport , Mass. , at 17 . For 12 years he navigated the seven seas , as boy , able seaman , master mariner . He saw mutinies , endured shipwreck , felt the stiff kick of weather in typhoonous China seas . In the home port of old Newburyport one day he met Alice , daughter of Banker Albert W. Greenleaf , aristocratic Massachussets name , courted , married , took his bride to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture ecclesiastical stained glass for Scandinavian Lutheran churches at Minneapolis , Minn . A few years later he was a magnate in less clerical plate glass . <P> Captain Brown wrote , published , told salt yarns . My Ditty Bag-dedicated to his " loved and loyal wife who sailed for Australia with me a week after our marriage , and who has been a good shipmate during these many years " - has an exciting chapter " Fishy " ending with a quoted instruction for " landing " the biggest possible swordfish aboard a dory in the open ocean : " Fasten his tail over the gunwale to the afterthwart ; put his sword over your shoulder ; put your big finger in his eyeball ; grab him with your other hand near his tail ; when she rolls to leeward pull hard as the boat rolls back , and the ' Cot damn fish he got to come . ' " <P> Last year and the year before Captain Brown sailed round the world . Every year since he left the trade of the sea he has yachted with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who flies a Boston Yacht Club flag . Up to his last illness he wrote sea yarns for the Atlantic Monthly , The Bellman . Modest , despite his immense knowledge and creditable learning , he had a quaint way of submitting his salty MSS. to University-bred employees , " just to have a glance over the grammar and syntax .
