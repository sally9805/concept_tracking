Clothes Make the Pirate . Leon Errol , bald comedian with a bad leg , made his screen debut in Sally and has followed with a starring farce . He plays a weak-spined little tailor , who pines for romance and gets it through the medium of being kidnaped by pirates . A good deal of the comedy is based on Mr. Errol 's noted knee , which gives out suddenly and often . Those in the smaller centres who have never seen this knee go wrong will be particularly amused . <P> The Road to Yesterday . Cecil De Mille , the prophet of midnight bathing parties and purple society dramas , has suddenly turned serious and to ill-effect . He has produced a drama in which the modern craze for psychology and complexes is the inspiration . It is a strange hybrid and smacks of Hollywood . Joseph Schildkraut is the star . His personality and appeal , so valuable in the legitimate box office , do not screen particularly impressively . <P> The Masked Bride . Another of those hideous paintings of Paris- Apaches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She plays a feminine crook whom love lures away from the treacherous paths of wickedness . <P> The Best Bad Man . Tom Mix <P> is one of the chronic stars with whom you can not quarrel . He always does the same , does it well and to the complete satisfaction of the millions . If it is stereotyped and unimportant it does not matter . This cinema is a Western rouser with a dynamited dam and flood at the climax .
