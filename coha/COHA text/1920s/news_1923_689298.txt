txt In two important issues which will press for decision in the next Congress  --  bonus legislation and modification of the Volstead act  --  President Coolidge holds nearly the same views as Mr. Harding did , according to those who have followed his career . He is reported as not opposed to a bonus , provided the necessary revenue is found , but will not insist , as did his predecessor , upon a sales tax . As to the wet and dry issue , it is known that Mr. Coolidge stands foursquare on a strict enforcement of the law , and does not believe that the Constitution can be modified to permit of the sale of beer and light wines . President Coolidge 's advisers , notably Senator Smoot , Chairman of the Finance Committee , have told ' him that a bonus bill will be passed over ' his veto . if necessary , by the next Congress . In the face of this legislative situation , it is said . President Coolidge is anxious to see the Republican leaders meet the situation squarely without embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is passed it shall carry revenue provisions acceptable to the Executive . Stands for Law Enforcement . While the President has never stated publicly his views as to the move to fiberalize the ' Volstead act , he has gone on record as to the beer and light wine law which Massachusetts sought to enact while he was Governor . He vetoed the bill , and In his message spoke strongly on the necessity to uphold law and order . He expressed no opinion on the merits of prohibition , but made it clear that his action in vetoing the bill was based entirely on legal cgrounds . The veto message , written on May a. 1920. reaus : " There is little satisfaction in attempting to deceive ourselves . " Mr. Coolidge said in the veto message . - There is ' grave danger in attempting to deceive the people . If this act were placed on the statdte books or tins t . On imtni wealth today it would provide no beer for the people . No one would dare act upon it , or , if any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Similar laws in other States are to date ineffective . I am opposed to the practice of legislative deception . It is better to proceed with candor . Wait une til the Supreme Court of the Uniretr States talks . " The proper authorities have declared the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution adopted . Under it Congress has passed legislation . Should the claim that the amendment is void be sustained , our present high license law remains in effect , and this act then will be a dead letter . No one would defend it . Should the act of Congress be declared void , let Congress pass a new law . Sworn to Support Constitution . " When I took office I give an oath to support the Constitution of the United States . That Constitution- and the laws of Congress are declared to be the supreme law of the land . It may be that the Eighteenth Amendment and the act under it are one or both void . So far as any court has decided , I understand the amendment has been sustained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where up to now they both stand as law . That which the court hesitates to decide I shall not hasten to declare . It would be extremely improper to undertake to influence that decision by the action of the law-making power of Massachusetts . Do not anticipate it . await it . " My oath was not to take a chance on the Constitution . It was to support it . When theproponents of this measure do not intend to jeopardize their safety by acting under it . why should I jeopardize my oath by approving it ? ? ? We have had too much legislation by clamor or tumult , or by pressure . Representative government ceases when outSide influence of any kind is substituted for the judgment of the representative . This does not mean that the opinion of constituents is to be ignored . It is to be weighed most carefully , for the representative must represent , but his oath provides that it must be ? faithfully and impartially , according to the best of his abilities and understanding , agreeably to the rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the law is questioned in these days all too much . The binding obligation of obedience against personal desire is denied in many quarters . If these doctrines prevail all organized government . all liberty , all security arc at an end . Force alone will prevail . "
