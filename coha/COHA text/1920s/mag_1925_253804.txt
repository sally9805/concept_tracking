Youthful Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. , able , active scion of an able , active line , whilom Hearstling , who in 1923 branched out from running the national news service that bears his name to endeavoring to establish a chain of newspapers in the U. S. ( beginning with two gum-chewers ' sheetlets in California TIME , Aug. 20 , 1923 ) , last week made a loud announcement . <P> Said he : " The Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles and The Illustrated Daily Herald of San Francisco lead in daily circulations in the Far West . <P> " On Jan. 12 , 1925 , another Vanderbilt tabloid will make its appearance , this time in Miami , Florida . . . . " <P> The pursuant description made it clear that the new paper , the name of which was not vouchsafed , would be much like its Vanderbiltian predecessors . These , in their day , were modeled after the famed gum-chewers ' sheetlets* of Manhattan . Compactly laid out , swathed in photographs , crowded with headlines , cluttered with " features " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day with the local and incidental , expanding the latter into longer stories whenever it possesses sufficiently sensational details . The Vanderbilt papers , however , do not exploit crime am scandal as do their Manhattan prototypes . Their two most visible bents arc educational ( stories of science and invention , popularly told , and local school notes ) and domestic stories ( of family-life , " happy reunion " pictures , brides and grooms , etc . ) . <P> Miami readers will also have spread before them " signed editorials , " of which the following ( from the Illustrated Daily News ) is a fair example : <P> " Providence , R. I. , Dec. 29- ( CV Service , Inc. ) - Winter , cold , cold winter in New England . What could be more unpleasant ? We scarcely know . . . . <P> " Long Island , its bleak , brown countryside frozen stiff and hard by the hoary winds of December , never looked more woebegone and distant that it did today . . . . An old manor house , the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , situated on the top of a little knoll at Plandome , is the residence of a half-brother of our wife , Martin Littleton , the well-known criminal attorney . . . . <P> " The East , the younger East , enjoys winter . . . . The older East detests it . It longs for Florida and California . And no wonder ! What have they here to live for ? ... <P> ( Signed ) " CORNELIUS VANDERBILT , JR .. <P> " Editor and Publisher .
