" The most extortionate proposal that has ever been made upon the nation 's revenues " - these would be harsh words from any man . From President Coolidge , who applied them last week to the Flood Control bill which had been passed by the Senate and was pending before the House , they sounded almost savage . President Coolidge added that the provisions of the bill would enrich great railroad and lumber companies besides impoverishing the national Treasury . The bill called nominally for $325,000,000 , but every one realized that in practice the cost could run as high as $1,500,000,000 , or $1,210,000,000 more than the Army engineers had asked for the work . The President suggested what an uproar Congress would have made if the situation were reversed , if the Administration had asked such a monster sum . He indicated pretty clearly what part he thought the railroad and lumber interests had played in the drafting of the provisions , which included purchase of rights-of-way as high as $75 per acre . " They shall not pass , " said the President 's tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , too . The Coolidge compromise proposals , carried by Republican Leader Tilson to the House Flood Control Committee , insisted upon local contributions of sites for levees and floodways . With equal insistence , the Committee-led by Reid of Illinois , Whittington of Mississippi , Driver of Arkansas , Wilson of Louisiana-would hear of no local contributions except , perhaps , sites for the bases of levees on the main stream of the Mississippi . <P> The twelve hours allotted by the House for the debate , wore on . Passage of the big bill impended . After that , a veto loomed . Meantime , in the Mississippi Basin , it was raining again . <P> Embarrassed by the Coolidge-Anyway movement , which last week cropped out right in his home State , President Coolidge issued further words on the subject , this time signing the letter himself instead of leaving it to Secretary Everett Sanders , as he did in March when Wyoming was importunate ( see p. 8 ) . <P> From the National Manufacturer 's Association , President Coolidge received comfort . The association 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Finance Committee that U. S. manufacturers regard " excessive " tax reduction as " a reckless invitation to an Executive veto under the President 's responsibility to sustain a balanced budget . " More , the manufacturers specifically endorsed the Administration 's latest tax-reduction estimate - $182,000,000 in case of a 30-million <P> Flood Control levy this year , or $201,000,000 if Flood Control is postponed . More still , the manufacturers took square issue with the U. S. Chamber of Commerce , whose insistence on a far larger tax-cut than the Administration approves is frequently represented to be the voice of Industry .
