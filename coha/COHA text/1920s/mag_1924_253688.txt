Four indictments were ground out by the machinery of Justice and largely buried from the public mind by the deluge of Convention gabble which filled the press for many days . <P> But , as a matter of fact , criminal indictments were returned against Edward L. Doheny , his son , " Jr. , " Harry F. Sinclair and Albert B. Fall . <P> In the natural course of events , action will be due in the Autumn . Last week , however , the two Dohenys filed motions to quash the indictments , arguing that there were , illegally , too many Federal officials inside the Jury rooms , and that the Attorney Gen eral 's office had no business to secure indictments when Congress had placed the oil cases in the hands of special counsel . Many moons and many motions will come to pass before the oil story has been rehearsed , revised , finally edited and entombed.
