txt After four days ' debate , in which every opportunity was given to the French reactionaries to show their strength , Premier Briand obtained ratification of the Locarno treaties tonight in the Chamber by a vote of 413 against 71 , about 100 Nationalists abstaining . At that the Rhineland treaty gets more than a twothirds vote in the lower house and sure ratification in the Senate . The nature of the debate which preceded this vote means that M. Briand can go to Geneva on Sunday with full authority to act in the spirit of Locarno , which , he says , to him is a religion . In the course of the debate the Premier declared that at Locarno no promises were made to Germany that she would be the sole nation admitted to the Council of the League and that the Council , when it met in Geneva on Sunday , would have full and complete liberty to do as it thought best . " The negotiators of Locarno , " he said , " had nothing to do with this question . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locarno and 1 made none . We are absolutely determined to respect the independence of the Council , which alone can decide the issue . Favors Enlarging the Connell . " But if you want to know what I think , I favor enlarging the Council . The Treaty of Locarno provides for jurisdiction by the Leaguo of Nations and the way should be fully opened for the nations involved to have free access to the League . That is why it would give me great pleasure to see Poland admitted and , believe me , if I represented German interests I would favor that . There is no doubt that there are difficulties between the Germans and the Poles and It is to Germany 's advantage , as well as Poland 's , that free opportunity should be given for discussion . " I can take rro stock in this business of giving to one country an isolated and sensational entry into , the Council . That is what I think about it . " The Premier had a field day . Welcoming attacks and unfavorable comment , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his weakened constitution , he towered morally head and shoulders above all his critics . There was not the slightest tinge of partisan politics in anything he said . He was out for conciliation withGermany and with everybody else . That was all there was to it , and any one who did not like it could vote against him . Wants Place Kept for America . Milhaud , speaking in favor of the treaty , said he favored the admission of Poland , Spain and Brazil , but hoped room would be saved for Russia and the United States . He praised the Locarno plan as the beginning of the formation of the United States of Europe . Deputy Uhry , Socialist , favored carrying the spirit of Locarno further by evacuating Coblenz and Mayence at once . He quoted the diary of General Allen to prove that the occupation was not rightly conducted . M. Briand interrupted to say that he personally believed General Allen was a friend of France and that while he might have found small things to criticize , he had no doubt of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of the afternoon session Franklin Bouillon , President of the Foreign Affairs Commission , urged ratification of the Rhineland Treaty . He saw holes in the arrangement but regarded it as France 's large ? effort . He urged close cooperation between France and England . He said England was really ready for this policy , because she no more desired to lose another million men in defeating Germany than France desired to lose another million and a half in the same effort . " If today England guarantees the Rhine it is because she understands that her frontier is there , " he went on . " Let us take every benefit of that understanding . " He argued that even if Germany did not live up to the trust the Locarno Treaty put in her , nevertheless there still remained the contract between England and France . He doubted the good faith of Germany . " Here we are today congratulating ourselves on Germany 's entry into the League , " ' he said . " But who is to be her delegate ? Count Bernstorff , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our side . The same people are running Germany . There is not a German who in his heart accepts the frontiers fixed by the Treaty of Versailles . There is not a political party in Germany which does not proclaim the right of Germany and Austria to be united . Well , Mus- solini has told them that that would be an immediate casus belli , and others may agree with him . " M. Briand replied that there was not only a moral side to Locarno , though he attached the greatest importance to it ; but for the benefit of Franklin Boullon and his friends he would say that there was something more in the treaty than trust in German good faith . Whenever after a great war the time came for conciliation it was the conqueror who should make the first move , and that was what France was trying to do . Franklin Bouillon replied that he believed that when the President of the Bavarian Council said he voted the Locarno Treaty , because for the next ten years the only thing for Germany to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave the attitude of most Germans . It was then the turn of M. Maginot , the lieutenant of M. Poincard . He said he had almost been won over by the speech of M. Briand , but had finally decided that he could not vote for the treaty because it looked to the disarmament of France . He declared that a. treaty whose value lay in the signature of Germany was not enough to justify France in disarming . He said the spirit M. Briand so eloquently expressed was in reality an insipid view of the spirit which obtained in Germany . " We can not vote for the Locarno treaty , " he continued , " for it means the disarmament of France in front of Germany , who does not disarm , and i because this treaty rests upon German good-will , of which the least I can say is that I have never seen any proof of it . I only hope time will prove you are right , but I believe you are wrong . " Paul Boncour said it was not fair to argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment of France . It left that issue entirely open . He said the big advantage of Locarno was that it committed Germany in a definite way to the arbitration of issues with France . The Chamber than moved that explanation of votes was in order , and it was interesting to see how often reference was made to the United States , it beinc , emphasized more than once that the Locarno Treaty would make a good impression in America . Deputy Clamamus . Communist , had a refreshingly new angle on the situation . " The United States is working toward the regroupment of the European nations in a capitalist plot to assure exploitation of the workers and thus injure Soviet Russia . " he said . " For Great Britain , Locarno consolidated her imperialism and prevents France from pursuing an independent policy toward Germany . " In replying to several objections M. Briand said : " I ask these critics if in 1914 we had had the guarantee of England and Italy and the certainty that we would have Czechoslovakia and Poland on our side would Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have Locarno , what are you going to have ? Treaties ? With whom ? We have no right here to doubt the word of England . The case of the neutrality of Belgium told us what the word of England was worth . " Some of you talk of disarmament . Well , disarmament was already in the Covenant of the League , and Locarno did not change that . " There was considerable uproar when Deputy Heuber , from Alsace , tried to talk in his Alsatian dialect , which resembles German so closely the difference can not be told . The Chamber refused to hear him , and after five minutes ' uproar President Herriot ruled that the speaker 's time to explain his vote had expired . The orator refused to budge , so M. Herriot suspended the session . Closing the debate the Premier said : " Oh , yes , this treaty may be fragile , but how fragile is peace ? If you have not got faith , if you can not get rid of pessimism , well , vote against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I am tranquil . I feel I have done my country a service , that I have made a step toward peace . The responsibility is upon you . "
