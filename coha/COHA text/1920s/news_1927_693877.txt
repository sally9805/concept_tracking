He declares that there is no disease for which golf is not good . This does not quite justify the headline , " Golf Viewed as Cure-All . " Dr. FOWLER did not say that he would send to the links patients suffering from double pneumonia or arthritis . Still his opinion should be a splendid offset to the grumblers and croakers who keep track of the number of men that die on the links from heart failure or apoplexy . How can it be told that they would not have collapsed if they had been quietly sitting at a club window and looking through melancholy eyes at the procession of youth and beauty in the street ? Let it be noted that Dr. FOWLER knows men with a bad form of valvular disease who , he is sure , have been kept alive by their interest in golf . He needlessly adds something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no devotee of the game will blame him too much for a little slip like that . If it were not for one thing , every golfer would wish to take and follow Dr. FOWLER 'S advice , and pay him handsomely for it . The sole . drawback lies in the contemporaneous news that the great English golfer , Ass MITCHELL , who was to lead a company of crack professional players on a tour of this country , has had to give up the trip on account of illness . Some stupid doctor told him that it would be a hazard to his health to play golf just now . Why did n't he consult Dr. FOWLER ? Then he might happily have gone on his way thinking of no hazard except the one that he could carry with his tremendous driving . Intelligent Larger Opportunity recognition of for changing times Musical Education . and conditions means expansion to many institutions . There are some organizations , however , created for a special purpose , and when it has been accomplished or when the trend of the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting different circumstances . Such a case is that of the Master School of Music in Brooklyn , which is closing the most successful year in its history , and also closing its doors . While it is a matter for regret that an institution which has done excellent pioneer work is no longer needed by the community , it seems wise to look squarely at the facts , and if they indicate the finish of the job , wind it up . When this school was opened , twenty-four years ago , there was no satisfactory place or method of operatic training in this country . The needs of students desiring musical education are now being met by the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Musical Foundation , and in other ways . A separately endowed school of music in Brooklyn is not required . The high purpose of the school and its efficient management have had one result which continues its name and ideals . It has steadily prospered and built itself up , so that there is now a considerable income from its endowment fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will be distributed among students of serious purpose and exceptional ability who intend to pursue a musical career . The fund will continue under the management of the directors of the school . Temperament united Storms and with courage has al Radio ways been characterin Poland . istic of the Polish people . The combination has recently led some of them to do what many Americans have wanted to do in the wee sma ' hours of the morning  --  attack the owner of a radio receiving set and all but murder him . The provocation in Poland was the rumor that the radio set was responsible for a violent thunderstorm which did much damage in the neighborhood . This is the first time , so far as known , that the radio has been accused of such pernicious activity . It has frequently been said that the storms exert a bad influence on the radio . But the radio has usually been identified with the effect rather than with the cause . Unfortunately , the Polish Weather Bureau failed to furnish exact statistics about the nature and duration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover whether or not the storm existed only in the ears of the neighbors .. Certainly the noise that comes out of some of the loud-speakers in this country might well confuse and terrify the uninitiated . Poland has set a precedent which should serve as a warning to careless radio fans in the United States . There will be plenty of alibis when the thunderstorm season Opens . It should be good news for somebody that a baker , evidently of a bent at once scientific and practical , has invented a cracker which may safely be eaten in bed . If cracker eating were a vice , it could now ' be practiced and concealed , for it leaves no crumbs to give the eater away . At the convention of biscuit and cracker bakers last week in Chicago there were one or two highbrow cynics who scoffed at the innovation . They said that eating crackers in bed was not a fact but a legend , and that the crumbless cracker would be a drug on the market , which is already supplied with 157 varieties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakers brought it out that children have been spanked , divorces granted and murder committed because of cracker crumbs in bed . Every other kind of cracker that man could wish for has been available for some years . The Secretary of the association announced that there is " an appropriate cracker for every time of day and night . There 's a cracker for every type of person , from the baby to the dyspeptic . " While it is called " the crumbless cracker , " inquiry from the skeptics compelled the inventor to disclose that a few crumbs may possibly be dislodged . But they are very special crumbs , " so soft that they will not scratch or otherwise disturb the lightest sleeper . " Let us not be too optimistic . We need not be princesses to be disturbed by a pea under forty mattresses in order to prefer a bed without cracker crumbs , even soft ones " with no sharp corners to add discomfort .
