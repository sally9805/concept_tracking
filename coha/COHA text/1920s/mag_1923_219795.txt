The decision of the Supreme Court that the nationality of a ship " partakes more of the characteristics of personal than of territorial sovereignty " altered the problem of enforcing the Volstead Act . As the decision pointed out , foreign ships , like foreign persons , when in United States territory ( which extends to the three mile limit ) are subject to the National Prohibition Law . Likewise United States vessels , like United States citizens , are not bound by our law when outside of United States territory . <P> So whereas until now the Prohibition enforcement officers have supposedly had the task of keeping United States vessels dry on the high seas , they have now , instead , to keep all vessels , American and foreign , dry within the three mile limit . The Treasury Department is drawing up regulations for enforcement according to the new interpretation of the law . Secretary Mellon has asked the State Department to inform foreign governments of the changed regulations to which all vessels arriving in the United States after June 10 will be subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all foreign vessels might have time to comply . <P> The new regulations give rise to some delicate international questions . Government officials , anxious to avoid complications , may be expected to draft the new regulations " with discretion . " Theoretically a ship carrying liquor , bound for example , from the Bermudas to Canada , would , if its course should chance to come within the three mile limit of the United States , be subject to seizure for illegal importation and transportation of liquor . It is understood , however , that no seizures of foreign vessels will be made ; that at most the liquor will be confiscated and certain other penalties imposed . Besides , foreign ships will be allowed to bring into American ports " medicinal liquor . " <P> The forces and the funds for prohibition enforcement are not sufficient for the search of every foreign vessel . <P> So only such vessels will be searched as prohibition officers have reason to believe are violating the law .                @ @ @ @ @
