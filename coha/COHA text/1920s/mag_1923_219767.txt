Vote of Confidence <P> Princeton has changed its undergraduate plan of study , in accordance with the ideas of President John Grier Hibben as stated last February . Beginning next fall , instead of the five courses now required of each student every term , four courses only shall be required , of which two shall be in the same department . This reduction in the number of courses shall be compensated for by the student 's independent work in the field of his major study . <P> The Princton degree will " be evidence that the graduate will not only have covered a broader field of knowledge as required by the student in general , he will also have mastered the fundamental of one subject and will have developed habits of independent thought and study . " The new program applies to junior and senior years only . <P> This is the most important development since the introduction of the preceptorial system during Woodrow Wilson 's regime as president . By the preceptorial system the student worked with the instructor and also with a group of fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely alone except for periodical consultations with his instructor . The new independent study plan is by no means an imitation of an English university method . It is an adaptation of American needs . It is a sound attempt to meet the criticism that the American college curriculum , have been snippets of courses , with the students ' work measured by hours like bricklaying . <P> The authorities of Princeton have virtually put on record a vote of confidence in the American undergraduate mind .
