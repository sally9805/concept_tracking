In connection with this last suggestion the subcommittee recommends the abolition of the personal property tax , which is declared to be unimportant . The subcommittee rejects a proposal for a tax on visitors , suggested by Professor Rogers , on the ground that the revenue would not compensate for the cost of its administration and the irritation and nuisance involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report of the subcommittee , of which Colonel Herbert H. Lehman is Chairman , was published several months ago , but the recommendations have been formulated only recently by the subcommittee , which has had as consultants Professors Lindsay Rogers , Howard Lee and Robert Murray Haig of Columbia University . Would Open Fiscal Year July 1 . The recommendations also advocate a change in the fiscal year of the city government to make it begin on July 1 instead of Jan. 1 , the placing of full responsibility of the preparation of the city budget on the Mayor , the establishment of a new City Department of Bt , Oget , prohibition of the practice of transferring accruals in city departments for purposes not contemplated by the budget , limitation on the issuance of special revenue bonds , a revision of the classification of civil service employes and a rearrangement of salaries without reductions and a stricter accounting and supervision of the city 's movable property . In discussing the need for developing new sources of city revenue , the subcommittee 's recommendations estimate that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than the general property tax , if the proposed subway construction plan is carried out . The moderate sum of $15,000,000 is allowed for increase in the city 's general expenses and the tax rate remains at its present figure of 2.66 . An increase of $774,000,000 in the valuation of taxable property is assumed in making this calculation . On the same basis and with the assumption that the assessed valuation will continue to increase at the rate of about $700,000,000 a year , the committee estimates a deficit of $17,200,000 in 1930 , one of $24,200,000 in 1931 and one of $10,700,000 in 1932 , which , it declares , must be made up from new sources of taxation or by increase of the tax rate . " These figures speak for themselves , " the subcommittee says . " If the program of the Board of Transportation is to be carried out and if the conservatively estimated increase of $15,000,000 a year is to be provided , a tax rate of 2.66 will be inadequate to meet revenue needs ; $61,200,000 of additional revenue must be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate must be forced above 2.66 , or additional revenue in substantial amounts must be secured from other sources . This is the only alternative , unless the estimated annual increase of $15,000,000 for expenses other than subways is scaled further down . Suggests Curb on State Tax . " The highest tax rate ever imposed in New York City was the 1921 rate of 2.77 . No doubt there would be bitter opposition to an increase above the 1928 level of 2.66 . An increase in the tax rate sufficient to meet both the program of the Board of Transportation and the estimated in crease of $15,000,000 for other purposes would , of course , be possible , even within the constitutional 2 per cent . tax rate limit . In view , however , of the probable strenuous opposition to any considerable property tax rate , it seems appropriate to turn at once to consideration of other possible sources of revenue . " The subcommittee suggests that it may be possible to get the State to abandon its direct tax on real estate , the city 's contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It adds that , since the State appropriations are growing , no great help from this source is likely , but declares that it may be possible to develop further the policy which the State now follows of collecting certain taxes and sharing them with localities on a n- ore or less arbitrary basis . Recommend Tax on Gasoline . Among such proposed taxes the subcommittee recommends a gasoline tax .. " Were it not for the insuperable practical difficulties , the principle of the old toll road in the case of city streets would present - attractions from the point of view of accurate distribution of costs in proportion to benefits " its recommendations read . " With the virtually complete motorization of traffic which has come about in recent years , the device of the gasoline tax offers on the whole a satisfactory approximation to the results which might be achieved by a system of tolls . Such a tax would result in a burden being attached to the . user of the streets roughly in proportion to the extent of that use . This suggests the desirability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should , of course , be administered by the State ; it would be impractical to administer it locally . ' The Legislature should be asked to levy this tax at a late which would permit the return to the city of a sum sufficiently large to contribute substantially toward Special Assessments Advocated . The plan of paying part of the cost of the construction of new subways by special assessments on property benefited , first proposed by John H. Delaney , Chairman of the Board of Transportation , and seemingly abandoned , is revived by the subcommittee , which urges a greater use of the special assessment method of paying for public improvements . On this point , the recommendations read : " The committee favors the establisisment of a policy of financing by special assessments all street improvements , including repaving , except in so far as these costs cats more fairly be met by a system of pricing or with revenues raised by taxes , such ? as the gasoline tax , which is itself an approximation of the pricing method . " We are of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the care of the streets by special assessments might be profitably canvassed . The cleaning of streets , the care of par 's strips , &c.,; are in many cities successfully financed in this way . Would Levy on Land Benefited . The committee regards it as unfortunate that all efforts seem to have been abandoned to utilize special assessments in connection with subways . It is true that the effects of subways upon land values are exceedingly complex . The precise limits within which special assessments may be soundly used are not known . Nevertheless the committee feels that the location of new subway lines and particularly the location of stations results in an entirely fortuitous gain to the owners of certain pieces of real estate . Thus by the special assessment method at least a part of the rich profit which because of location decisions accrues to certain particularly favorably located plots might be recovered . Furthermore the committee believes it would be possible to work dut s plan . whereby , w portion of the In proposing a tax on unincorporated business and the abolition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property tax in New York City in 1927 produced a little less than $2 , - 000,000 . In suggesting that a tax on unincorporated business be substituted for it , the subcommittee says : " It is now estimated that the yield of a tax on the incomes of unincorporated businesses , levied at the rate of 5 per cent . with an initial exemption of $5.000. would be somewhere between $17,000.000 en $21.000,000 a year . New York City 's share of this would probably be considerably more than one-half , if the distribution were made upon the basis of the location of the business reporting the income . " In recommending that the Mayor be made responsible for the city budget , the subcommittee says : " Your committee is of the opinion that responsibility for the preparation of the budget and its proposal to the Board of Estimate is not sufficiently centralized . In our judgment , the Mayor , not the Board of Estimate , should be responsible for the preparation of the budget , - and should present it to the Board of Estimate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget should be established by local law . The director of the budget , subject to appointment and removal by the Mayor , should be the executive head of this department , and most of the examiners and some of the engineers now under the Secretary of the Board of Estimate should be transferred to the department . The tax budget should be prepared by the director of the budget and . to the Board of Estimate by the Mayor , with a statement or message analyzing and outlining its more important features . In short , all initial proposals of financial expenditures should pass under his scrutiny and then go to the Board of Estimate with the recommendation of the Mayor . " It also proposes a change in the budget dates as follows : Feb. ** date for filing departmental estimates with the Director of the Budget . March ** date , as at present . for the Board of Taxes and Assessments to certify the assessment rolls to the Board of Aldermen . March ** date for filing supplementary or mandatory departmental estimates April ** on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Estimate . April ** date for increasing items in the budget .

May ** date for final adoption of the budget by the Board of Aldermen . June ** date for filing the budget in the office of the Controller . July ** date for fixing the annual tax rates by the Board of Aldermen . Discontinuance of the practice of issuing special revenue bonds for the expenses of snow removal , claims and judgments , Fire Department Relief Fund , Transit Commission , Board of Transportation , Armory Board and voting machines is recommended . In the case of the Transit Commission , where the issuance of the bonds is mandatory on application of the commission , the subcommiteee declares that in fairness the Legislature should amend the Public Service Commission law to put the appropriations for the Transit Commission in the State budget or on the same basis as other city appropriations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that appropriations , based on the experience of other years , would reduce the issuance of special revenue bonds to a minimum . ' To protect the city from excessive condemnation awards in the acquisition of land , sometimes five or six times the amount of the assessed valuation , the sub-committee suggests that the , city should not take title until ' after ' a tentative award by a court in condemnation proceedings and then should have power to refuse to take the land and discontinue the proceedings on payment of costs , if the Board of Estimate should regard the award as exces-H rim the cost of the facilities offered by arterial streets . " The subcommittee adds that it has been estimated that a tax of 1 cent a gallon on gasoline would yield the State $10,000,000 a year and that , based on the return of from onefourth to one-half of this to the localities New York City might get $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 a year . funds needed would be obtained from a tax falling upon land values alone rather than upon real estate in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dates .
