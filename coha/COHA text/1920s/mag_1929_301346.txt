For a day last week Rafael Merry del Val stepped reluctantly out of the shadow of the retirement in which he has lived since the death of Pope Pius X , his beloved friend . He celebrated the silver jubilee of his elevation , at the hands of Pius X , to the cardinalate . He celebrated a high mass . He attended a banquet in his honor . Then once again he withdrew into the cloister of his memories . <P> It was a political tangle which precipitated Merry del Val on his so-glittering early career . Cardinal Rampolla was expected to succeed to the papacy when Leo XIII died in 1903 . But objections were raised and the election finally went to Giuseppe Sarto , a simple priest , peasant by birth , peasant-hearted to the end of his days . <P> With infinite trepidation the new , tenth Pius looked about for some more worldly figure on whom to lean in the grave duty of administering affairs of state . At that time young Merry del Val , only 38 , had acted as secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Noble Ecclesiastics at Rome , where he had studied for the priesthood . <P> No peasant was Merry del Val , but scion of an ancient Spanish family , grandee by birth and inclination , rich , sophisticated . He was the son of Don Rafael Marquis Merry del Val , secretary to the Spanish ambassador at London . His mother , the granddaughter of Brodie McGee Willcocks , onetime M. P. , had mingled a strain of English blood with Merry del Val 's paternal Spanish . Born in London , Merry del Val had been educated at Baylis House . He completed his theological studies in Rome and was ordained priest at 23 . <P> Under Pope Leo XIII Merry del Val was Master of the Robes and Privy Chamberlain , and one of the youngest members of the papal household . He had ample exercise for his patrician tastes . He liked horses , liked dancing ; he was an excellent shot . In ecclesiastical matters however he was not widely known . And when the new pope , Pius X , in his emergency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came as a distinct shock . <P> It was expected , of course , that the appointment would be only temporary . On the contrary , three months later the Pope made Merry del Val a Cardinal and gave him the full secretary title . Thereafter for eleven years Merry del Val at the Vatican counselled , conferred , carried out the policies of the peasant Pius . He enunciated his Pope 's vigorous disapproval of all modernistic tendencies , in religion and in society . He became a world figure . <P> Strangely ill-mated as the two seemed-the simple , ascetic Pope and the flashing knightly young Cardinal-they soon became united by the strongest bonds : dependence and admiration on the part of Pius , affection on the part of Merry del Val . <P> In 1914 , when Pius died , Merry del Val seemed by all odds the likeliest candidate for St. Peter 's throne . But a new force had arisen in the Catholic hierarchy , Giacomo della Chiesa , Archbishop of Bologna . Cardinal della Chiesa had delivered a striking address on the outbreak of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe the strictest neutrality , yet make every effort to restore peace and mitigate suffering . The fine periods of that address were still echoing when the Cardinals met to elect a new Pope . Ten ballots were cast and as the smoke of their burning ascended from the Vatican , it was della Chiesa , not del Val , who experienced the emotion of becoming God 's spokesman on earth .
