A 19-year-old high school youth fired a revolver six times , in Warsaw , last week , and threw the Soviet Government into a state of such excitement that the official Soviet newspaper Isvestia soon accused Chancellor of the British Exchequer Winston S. Churchill of directing a secret band of assassins pledged to exterminate Soviet officials . Isvestia added , explanatorily : " London is a nest of murderers . " Soviet War Minister Clemence Voroshilov declared : " The British maintain a band of murderers and brigands in our country . " What banal and sordid crime provoked these flamboyant charges ? <P> <P> Into the Central Station at Warsaw glided a long sleeping - car train from Berlin . It bore Comrade* A. P. Rosengolz , expelled Soviet Charge d'Affaires to Great Britain , who was en route last week back to Moscow ( TIME , May 13 ) . Stepping from the train , M. Rosengolz was greeted warmly by Comrade Peter Lazarevitch Vojkov , Soviet Minister to Poland , very generally believed to be an official who signed the death warrants of the late Tsar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Comrades entered the station buffet , ordered tall glasses of steaming tea . The train would wait an hour , then carry them both on to Moscow . . . . <P> Half an hour later MM . Rosengolz and Vojkov were pacing up and down the platform deep in talk . Suddenly a youth accosted them . He was a high school student of Vilna . . . Boris Kovenko , he said . Would Soviet Minister Vojkov please grant him a passport to enter Russia ? He had applied often at the Soviet Legation , but had been refused for no reason that he could understand . Would not the Soviet Minister grant his request ? . . . <P> Comrades Rosenholz and Vojkov , thus interrupted , resumed their walk without replying to Boris Kovenko . He , snubbed , drew a revolver and fired at M. Vojkov . The Soviet Minister whipped out his own revolver , but sagged to the ground before he could wound Boris Kovenko , who continued methodically to empty all six chambers of his revolver into the crumpled body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassin carelessly surrendered his revolver , saying only : " I killed Vojkov . ... I acted from idealistic motives . " <P> <P> Two newspapers frankly condoned the murder . At Vilna , Poland , home city of Murderer Kovenko , the White Russian newspaper Novaia Rossia appealed for contributions wherewith to retain able defense attorneys in his behalf . Immediately the Polish Government suppressed Novaia Rossia , placed the editor in jail . In London Lord Rothermere 's violently anti-red Evening News declared : " The slain man ( Vojkov ) signed the death warrants of Tsar Nicholas II and the Russian Imperial family . By Vojkov 's assassination at the hand of a royalist , retribution has come to one of the chief perpetrators of one of the foulest murders in history . " <P> Meanwhile at Warsaw , President Ignatz Moscicki of Poland personally telegraphed to Chairman Michael Ivanovitch Kalinin of the Union Central Executive Committee , - at Moscow : <P> " Very deeply shocked and indignant over the outrageous murder of M. Vojkov . I beg you to be good enough to accept this expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government officially despatched a note of similar tone to the Soviet Government . What would Moscow reply ? *
