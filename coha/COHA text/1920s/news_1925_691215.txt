txt Confusing Signs on Subway Trains . It seems strange that there has not as yet been an emphatic public protest against the practice recently adopted by the subway management of labeling the trains with the names of both te : mini , leaving the passenger to guess which way the train is going , and to hesitate lest he may have come down the wrong stairway by mistake . In the rush there is confusion enough without adding this element of uncertainty . The management is highly commendable In many ways , and is appreciated by those who realize the magnitude of its problems , but In this particular it is inexcusable and erasAerating . Incidentally , the signs in many cases can not be read at all if the train la moving , on account of the dirt on the win dows . For sanitary reasons alone the Hoard of Health should require that that condition be revolutionized . It has long been a disgrace to the city . E. S. J. New York .
