The Grand Trunk of the Order of Elephants produced a new ballad last week . Thirty-four years ago when he was selling hats in Manhattan he wrote the ballad now used for Brown Derby parades . Its chorus : <P> East Side , West Side , all around the town , The tots sing " Ring-around-rosie , " " London Bridge is falling down , " Boys and girls together , me and Mamie Rorke <P> Tripped the light fantastic on the sidewalks of New York . <P> Now he is selling portieres in Manhattan . The first verse and chorus of his new song are : <P> It 's the same old town with a new coat of paint , <P> I 'm an oldtimer with no complaint ; <P> I 've seen this town when everything was bright , <P> When the old swinging doors were swinging day and night , <P> The old bartender , the bar and the rail , Manhattan , Martini and the Bronx cocktail , <P> The old mellow whisky aged in the wood- <P> I did my drinking when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking when the drinking was good , <P> When the good old stuff was aged in the wood . <P> I never take a drop now-would n't if I could- <P> ' Cause I did my drinking when the drinking was good . <P> The Grand Trunk is James W. Blake , benign-looking , round-faced man who wears eyeglasses . His Order of the Elephants , which he founded , tries to spread happiness among business men . The only requirement for membership is to keep smiling . Lodges are called " tusks. "
