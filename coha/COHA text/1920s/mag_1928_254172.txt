An international jury , composed of ten able musicians and headed by famed Walter Johannes Damrosch , sat in Vienna last week . The jury wished to award a $10,000 prize to someone for the best musical composition in the vein of Franz Schubert , whose centennial the Viennese are this year celebrating . If possible , they wished to select a satisfactory completion , by the hand of some contemporary , of Schubert 's Unfinished Symphony . <P> The latter commission they were , as had been predicted , unable to fulfill because none of the efforts submitted seemed entirely adequate . The grand prize of $10,000 offered by the Columbia Phonograph Company they could and did award-to one Kurt M. Atterberg , 40 , of Sweden , for his Symphony in C Major .
