A Stinson-Detroiter monoplane glided down upon Langley Field , at Hampton , Va. , one day last week and the two men who stooped out of her cabin asked army mechanics to help them trundle the plane at once into a hangar . <P> That done , they hauled tarpaulin , chain and padlocks from their cabin and securely shrouded their motor from prying eyes . They had reached Langley Field in 6 hrs. 50 min. flying time and they took precautions because , underneath the chain-wrapped tarpaulin , was the first diesel-type motor ever used successfully for airplane propulsion . The flyers were Mechanical-engineers Lionel M. Woolson and Walter Edwin Lees . Their employer , developer of something new and great in the air , was Packard Motor Car Co . <P> No patents now are obtainable on diesels or their modifications , for plane-power or other drive. * Several manufacturers have been experimenting with diesel modifications for aircraft . Some of their representatives were at Langley Field last week , attending the fourth annual Engineering Research Conference conducted by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peers that Packard Engineers Woolson and Lees had flown the 650 wind-jostled miles from Detroit . It was to frustrate competitive inquisitiveness that they hooded their motor . <P> Five years Engineer Woolson and his research staff at the Packard plant have labored designing the motor . They had , first , the diesel principle to go on , i.e. , that air can be heated by compression until hot enough to ignite a jet of fuel oil . <P> Their problem was to make such an engine light enough for efficient flying . <P> Their accomplishment , reached and tested episodically last year , is a nine-cylinder , radial , air-cooled motor . It lacks , of course , the sparkplugs , wires , magnetos , etc. , essential in spark-ignited gasoline engines . A pipe line distributes oil under pressure to each of the cylinders . The present machine delivers 200 h.p. , and is slightly less in diameter than gasoline radials of like power . It weighs nearly 3 Ib. per h.p. , against the average 2 Ib. per h. p. of gasoline types . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel . For example , last week 's 7-hour ( actually 6 hr. , 50 min. ) astonishment flight required 54 gal . of oil , costing $4.68 and weighing 365 Ib . A gasoline radial would have required for the same trip 91 gal . of gas , costing $27.30 and weighing 546 Ib . On last week 's short flight the gasoline engine and its fuel would have been slightly lighter than Packard 's diesel and its oil . On longer flights with more gallons of fuel needed the diesel combination would obviously be the lighter . Other accomplishments included reductions of fire hazard ( oil requires higher temperature than gasoline for ignition ) and radio interference ( by the electrical wires of the gasoline engine 's ignition system ) . <P> Because no patents are obtainable , Packard is guarding its new product until it can get into production and thus " get the jump " on the rest of the industry . To that end the company has already started a special 300,000 sq . ft. factory and scheduled future production .
