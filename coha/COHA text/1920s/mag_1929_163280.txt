The White House made ready for a major international event : President Hoover 's promulgation of the General treaty for the renunciation of war . The ratification by Japan , the last of the 15 original signatories to approve the Treaty , was on its way to Washington . To East Room ceremonies were invited twoscore diplomats representing the ratifying powers . The President had a speech ready . A formal luncheon was to be served in the State dining room . Among the prime guests was to be Frank Billings Kellogg , the Coolidge Secretary of State who brought to fruition the idea of France 's Aristide Briand for such a treaty . Calvin Coolidge had also been asked to attend . There were to be band music , cameramen , a nationwide hookup . <P> On the other side of the world from Washington , however , that was brewing which might make the Kellogg Treaty absurd on the first day of its legal existence . Soviet Russia and Nationalist China , two of the signatories of the pact , were on the explosive verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embarrassment of the situation , cogitated in his office . He could , of course , communicate what was on his mind to Nationalist China , but to Soviet Russia he could not speak . The U. S. does not recognize the Soviet 's existence . Lawyerlike , Statesman Stimson remembered , got out , and ruffled the unused pages of the so-called Four-Power Treaty which the U. S. , Britain , France and Japan drafted in 1921 . A phrase in this treaty makes it possible for the Four Powers to discuss " freely and fully " almost any Far Eastern matter . Statesman Stimson sent for his excellency Paul Claudel , Ambassador from the other parent country of the Kellogg Treaty and one of the Four Powers . He also called in the British , Japanese and Italian representatives to tell them what went on . Soon from Washington to Moscow , via Paris flashed word that Statesman Stimson thought Russia should be reminded that she had " renounced war . " <P> Arriving in Washington for the White House ceremony , Mr. Kellogg spoke hopefully of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be any war . . . . The dispute is ... very susceptible to pacific settlement . " <P> Before many days passed Messrs . Stimson and Kellogg received reassuring news . Came formal notices from Russia and China that each would live up to the terms of the Kellogg Treaty ( see p. 22 ) . Statesmen the world over applauded Statesman Stimson 's perspicacity and promptitude for his " reminder . "
