As men have stood at curbs or in tabernacles or Army recreation halls and lustily wailed , <P> Throw out the life line , Throw out the life line , Someone is drifting away . Throw out the life line , Throw out the life line , Someone is sinking today ; then found themselves refreshed in body with the chest exercise and in soul with the sentiment , they would wonder about famed Mr. Anonymous , the author so far as they knew . Last week the Boston Globe disclosed the man , pushed him to the fore , named him as the septuagenarian Rev. Edward S. Ufford . <P> Some 41 years ago Evangelist Ufford , in the leafy village square of Westwood , Mass. , was exhorting the villagers with much gusto yet with some despair , for on the outskirts of the throng he noted many youths and maidens giggling and cutting up . How frail are their ties to the Church , reflected the young Methodist , even as he labored and prayed . They were drifting . . . sinking . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , at home , in half an hour he composed his hymn , which has been translated into nearly all major languages . Once in a tour of the world , he dramatically played out his hymn , using various maritime paraphernalia , which included two U. S. Government life lines used in rescuing 23 sailors from shipwrecked vessels . He wore a beribboned cap bearing as inscription , " Around the World with a Life Line . "
