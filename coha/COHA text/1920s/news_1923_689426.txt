txt On charges of irregularities in the purchase of supplies for the Bureau of Canals and Waterways made by Colonel Frederick Stuart Greene , Superintendent of the State- Department of Public Works , Supreme Court Justicp Joseph A. Kellogg , an hour/ after his appointment as a special Commissioner by Governor Smith this afternoon , began a hearing into the administration of the Canal Bureau prior to the . incumbency of Colonel Greene . The Governor acted almost immediately after an hour 's conference with Colonel Greene . Edward S. Walsh , now Commissioner of Canals and Waterways , was Superintendent of Public Works at the time the alleged irregularities occurred . Colonel Greene charged that $70,000 paid for supplies bought from the General Mill and Contractors ' Supply Company , with offices at ' 899 Broadway , Albany , was $25,000 more than the same supplies could have been bought for in the open market . Colonel Greene was the first witness and he was on the stand most of the afternoon . He submitted bill after bill for purchases made for the State purporting to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Reynolds K. Townsend and Edward L. Swazy are chiefly interested , had charged prices far in excess of market value . Three purchases were cited specially during Colonel Greene 's testimony . One was a gasoline electric.generator , bought through the company for $550 , the market price being alleged to be $435 . The second was an air compressor purchased for $850 , the market price being put at $495 . The third was fourteen sixty-foot lengths of one and a half inch buoy chain for $6.20 a. length , or a total of $940.80 , the market price being quoted at $134.40 . The last of the three was given by Colonel Greene with some hesitancy . " That is so extraordinary , " he told Justice Kellogg , " that I hate to give it . I ca n't understand what would make that chain cost that moneyunless it was made of precious metal . " The bills had been taken from the files of the Canal Bureau and were actual records of payment . A charge of $205 for hoisting cable was cited . The market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cotton waste showed $42 , the alleged market price being $36 . For pipe taps and a pipe wrench $21.60 was charged , but the market price was put at $9.93 . For a c611 of Manila rope $26.10 was charged , the market price being quoted at $18 . Mr. Walsh followed Colonel Greene on the stand . Asked who had charge of the purchase of supplies in the Canal Bureau , the witness said he had delegated that duty to his deputy , James E. Doyle , and that he personally had nothing to do with purchases . He knew nothing about the General Mill and Contractors ' Supply Company except in a general way . He understood Mr. Swazy was its head . " Do you know of any reason why all these supplies should be bought of this company ? " he was asked . " I do not , " was the reply . His attention had first been called to the fact that the Albany firm was geting most of the bureau 's orders by his secretary , Miss Mary A. Conner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole , an auditor in the bureau . At that time Mr. Doyle was on a vacaion , but the witness had called his at:ention to the purchases when he re.urned . " I told him ' for heaven 's sake do n't Jo this any more ; stop ordering from . his mill and supply company , ' " testi ! fed Commissioner Walsh . " He said : ' My gracious , I do not know Lnything about the company , and will lot give them any more orders . ' " " But it was not stopped , ' was it ? " Mr. Ir . Kellogg asked . l'Apparently not , " was the reply . Commissioner Walsh explained that he Lever saw the requisitions for supplies . Mr. Kellogg then cited the bill for a gasoline electric generator bought for use 13 . ? Amsterdam through the General Mill and Supply Company for $960 when the market price was alleged to be $435 ; and which the Albany firm never handled , but which was shipped direet by the Fairbanks-Morse Company , the manufacturer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness . " No , sir , " Mr. Walsh replied . " It does n't look right , does it , " pursued Mr. Kellogg . " No , sir , " replied the witness . Mr. Walsh was unable to explain any of the various items . ' He asserted that the prices read to him as having been paid by the State were wrong , and that he knew of no reason why those prices should have been paid . When the bill for the buoy chain was shown to him he declared it was " exorbitant . " Mr. Walsh 's testimony brought out the fact . that the persons who would have to approve an order for supplies would have to be the person who made the original requisition ; the Chief Inspector , Henry L. Castor ; the Deputy Commissioner , Mr. Doyle ; the Auditor , W. A. Cole , and the Controller 's office . " It has to go by the Deputy Commissioner of Canals , the man who made the original requisition , and ultimately the Auditor , " Mr. Kellogg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be posted on values ? " " That 's the assumption , " Mr. Walsh I answered . In answer to a request for suggestions as to how to get at the bottom of the mystery , Mr. Walsh said he hau known nothing of the investigation unti three-quarters of an hour after thi . Governor announced that one would be conducted , but that he would be glad to do all in his power to be of assistance . Mr. Doyle on the stand testified his duties consisted in part of approving bureau purchases , and that he generally acted on the recommendation of Chief Inspector Castor in approving orders for supplies or materials . " Who made the choice of , the general mill supply ; who wrote in that name on the order ? " he was asked . " I suppose Mr. Castor , " Mr. Doyle replied . ' Who agrees on the prices ? " " I think Mr. Castor agrees on the prices . " " Who approves the prices ? " " I do . " " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I do n't know . I ask Mr. Castor if this is a fair price and I take his information on that . He recommends the purchase . A large number of orders may come in and I have to take the word of the men in the field . " The investigation will continue tomorrow .
