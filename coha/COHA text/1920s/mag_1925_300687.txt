Harold E. ( " Red " ) Grange , an Illinois University footballer , will be a Congressman if certain of his friends who like to see him run have their way . Last week they circulated a petition to put him on the Republican primary ballot as candidate for Congressman-at-large . If nominated next April he might be elected next November , and in December , 1927 , when the next Congress will probably meet , he would be only six months under the minimum age for Congressmen ( 25 years ) . <P> John W. Langley , of Pikeville , Ky. , was convicted some 18 months ago of conspiracy to violate the prohibition law . Some twelve months ago he was elected to serve two years in Congress at a salary of $10,000 a year . Last week the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that Langley should serve two years in the penitentiary and pay a $10,000 fine . The Supreme Court may have to decide which course Mr. Langley will follow . <P> The story was told and was published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt-funding Commission at dinner , someone brought up for conversation " the personality of Benito Mussolini . " It was agreed that he had a genius for organization and then-so the story ran-Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur turned to his neighbor at table , Signor Alberto Pirelli , " financial wizard of Italy , " and remarked : <P> " That boss of yours thinks he can accomplish everything by the use of force . How long does he think he can get away with that stuff ? "
