American Tobacco Co. this week announced the appropriation of $12,300,000 to advertise Lucky Strike cigaret in 1929 . Of this amount , $6,500,000 will be spent in newspapers , virtually every U.S. daily being included in the list ; $3,000,000 will be spent for billboards , $1,200,000 for magazine space , $1,000,000 for window displays and other " dealer helps , " and $600,000 for radio . The $12,300,000 appropriation is probably the largest sum ever invested in the advertising of one product . General Motors has spent about $17,000,000 in a year 's advertising , but this amount included many cars , many agencies . The theme of the 1929 Lucky Strike campaign will presumably be the " Reach for a Lucky when you feel like eating sweets " idea which has already provoked a war between the candy industry and American Tobacco Co . Lord &; Thomas and Logan is handling the account .
