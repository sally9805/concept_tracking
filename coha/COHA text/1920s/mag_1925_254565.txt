The great body of respectable medical practitioners , the allopaths ( as distinguished from the promoters of all sorts of strange and often quack cures and methods ) , have it as one of the strictest items of their code of ethics that they will not advertise their services in the public press or by any other commercial means . Any doctor who does so is regarded by them as beyond the pale , probably a quack . <P> But possibly this code of ethics may be modified , if one may judge by the recent action of the Texas State Medical Association . True , the doctors of the great respectable group are never likely to adventure into the public prints each individually boasting of his marvelous powers and miraculous cures . But the Texas State Medical Association created a committee to devise dignified and effective means for advertising for the great body of allopathic physicians . This committee passed resolutions urging county Medical Associations 1 ) to publish advertisements in local papers of educational nature advising people how to get proper treatment for diseases and avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time in these papers lists of the members of the county Medical Associations , so that the public might know what doctors in their opinion were properly qualified to give adequate treatment to patients . <P> The President of the Texas Medical Association , Dr. C. M. Rosser , went before the Texas Press Association in convention and explained the new course adopted by the doctors . <P> One of the first fruits of the new policy was the appropriation of $25,000 for this type of advertising by the Dallas County Medical Association , planning to insert each week a half-page advertisement in each of the four daily newspapers of Dallas . Three of the four newspapers have also announced their intention , by way of coperation , of not accepting any further advertisements from unlicensed doctors .
