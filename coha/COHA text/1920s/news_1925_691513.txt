txt " We can not expect better conditions than now prevail , " said Professor BJERKNESS , the weather observer at King 's Bay , Spitzbergen , and at 5:15 P. M. , May 21 ( New York Daylight Saving Time , 12:15 P. M. ) , RAOLD AMUNDSEN and his five companions , one of them , LINCOLN ELLSWORTH , an American , rose into the air in two flying boats and were off for the North Pole . The planes scudded over the harbor Ice easily . The pontoons were constructed for the ice surfaces to be expected in the vicinity of the Pole . PEARY wrote that , except for occasional pressure ridges , the ice in the last day 's sledding and at the Pole rx as smooth . AMUNDSEN therefore counted upon a fairly good surface for landing and taking off . PEARY reached his goal on April 6 . AMUNDSEN began his flight forty-five days later . He expected milder weather as he neared the Pole . The temperature during PEARY 'S observations ranged from 11 to 30 degrees below zero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the end of his " dash "  --  a word he used himself ? he encountered " infrequent pressure ridges . " The surface would thus have been suitable for landing by a careful airplane pilot . PEARY crossed or worked round " leads , " or gaps of open water . ' In the end of May more " leads " and a moving plain of ice might be expected . On the way back from the Pole , and three days ' march from it on April 9. th ? " leads " passed on the upward journey " were " greatly widened and new ones had " been formed . " On that day " the ice , " PEARY says , " was raftering all " about us and beneath our feet under " the pressure of the howling gale . " During the gale the temperature " hung between 18 and 22 degrees below zero . " Such records must have been studied by AatursniisEN . There was nothing in the Peary diary to disturb an explorer who had planned a flight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but from Professor BJ ERKNE S S ' S prediction of three or four days ' fair weather it may be concluded that AMUNDSEN did not expect to be away from his Spitzbergen base any longer than on his first attempt to reach the Pole and perhaps get a glimpse of the unknown between the Pole and Alaska . The expedition was planned with characteristic thoroughness . As an explorer AMUNDSEN has always. , ' en prepared for emergencieh . Gasoline was carried for flying 180 miles further than the distance to the Pole and back . provision was made for a march from the Pole to North Greenland if the planes had to be abandoned . The equipment included a sledge , a tent and a canvas boat , also hunting weapons . To the fnan who bad fought his way to the South Pole in severe weather at march to North Greenland in mild temperatures should not be a formidable adventure . But the airplane equipment was as complete as experience could make it . On this dash for the North Pole aviation was ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
