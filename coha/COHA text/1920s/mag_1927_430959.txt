THE OTHER day I took an American friend , who follows British politics closely and knows most of our prominent figures by name though not by sight , to the House of Commons . One always gets a fresh light from the impressions of an intelligent stranger , and with interest I watched his quick eyes traveling over the scene and taking it in . It was a " big " day . The chamber was crowded . Questions were going on as we took our places , and there did not seem to be a vacant seat anywhere . Order-papers rustled like leaves . Every one was there . The two front benches , on each side of the table before the Speaker 's Chair , the table that carries the mace and the sacred boxes which are thumped in moments of tension by the great , were both packed . At first it was not easy to distinguish faces , even when one knew them , and I was glad my friend sat in silence for some time . Suddenly I heard him say : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the bench ? With curly white hair and remarkable eyes . At first I picked him out as simply the handsomest of the bunch , but the more I look at him the more he impresses me . He 's alive ; those eyes of his are taking it all in , though he sits with arms folded . . . . Ah , he 's up now . . . . This is great . " A period of confused bustle had been followed by a low rumble of cheering , and now , out of the blurred indistinctness , a voice carried itself up to us by virtue not so much of volume as of musical quality of tone , aided by a firm enunciation of essential consonants . As Ramsay MacDonald ? for it was he and not Stanley Baldwin , Lloyd George , or Winston Churchill who had been thus picked out as the " real " man among the shadows ? went on speaking , this sense of authority grew . " Hard man to answer , this . . . . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . . . . Fine ? he 's got them there . . . . Oh , very good indeed . " He laughed as cheering and counter-cheering broke out , and an interruption was swiftly seized and turned to advantage . Other speakers followed . All the big guns were out in action . But I observed that my friend 's attention always returned to MacDonald . " I 'm surprised , " he said , as we came away . " He 's not in the least what I had thought . You have to see people to get the hang of them . . . . I did n't agree with him , of course : never should ; but that 's neither here nor  | there . He 's got the stuff . Brainslooks ? voice . No wonder he stands out . And he 's got something the other fellows have n't . Personal quality ? Vision ? I do n't know . But there it is . . . . He 's seen something big , bigger than himself , and it shines through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , I 'm all het up about the fellow . " I smiled back at him . " Yes , " I said . " That 's why many people hate him so much and nobody can stop talking about him . " For two reasons , this observer 's reactions are worth recording . The first , and more important , is that they register the impression which nearly every one gets who encounters MacDonald in action ? whether he is seen handling men in committee or conference , acting in an executive capacity , or speaking in any kind of public meeting . He is , by universal admission , a perfect chairman ? fair , tolerant , and efficient . He is equally formidable as a fighter on the floor , and has had a wide experience of both roles . The fighting instinct is indeed so strong that some have doubted his pacifism ? even after 1914 ? as they enjoy the calling out of his resources that occurs when he has his back to the wall . Any one who heard him howled down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him turn chill hostility into irresistible enthusiasm , went up to the Labor Party Conference at Liverpool in 1925 with eager anticipations of a " good show . " The Left Wing critics had assembled their cohorts ; the Communists gathered for a final assault ; the nervous disquietude that followed on the 1924 election seemed to provide the ideal atmosphere ; the " London Times " ? not prone to idle prophecies ? declared that MacDonald was in " for the fight of his life " and was obviously hopeful of an issue that would sink him and the Labor party together . MacDonald took the gloves off , and the upshot of the conference was a demonstration of his unchallengeable ascendancy . He is never so dangerous as when he is " up against it . " In a crisis , he calls upon his daimon , and it obeys him . Its appearances are incalculable except in so far as they follow this law of necessity . Some hint of it , however , is almost always there . His speeches are not always good , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of phrase opening long vistas of idea ? to work like a ferment in their brains when they go home : some line of light that travels in and out among the circumlocutions and the close time of the argument that baffle reporters . They feel power and , over and above it , an odd lifting personal quality . People who meet MacDonald socially may and often do miss this . For such occasions he has the charm of friendly approachability , a remarkable memory for faces , a quick interest in little things , a somewhat naive penchant for prolix and unrevealing anecdote , and a general culture that surprises those who expect a Labor leader to be ignorantly crude and flatteringly simple . Finding him agreeable but not dangerous , they are relieved but also disappointed . He has no ambition to seem dangerous : that , for him , belongs to " nursery politics . " " Sweet  | reasonableness " is his social line . But any one who imagines that this good form of his implies weakness or softness of fiber makes a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his convictions , and has no need to parade them or typify them in a red tie and hobnailed boots , nor any fear of their being jeopardized by his clothing the external man in the correct garb of ceremonial observance . Nor is this all . MacDonald has the pride and the shyness of the Scot ? all the Scot 's stingy economy , all his queer secretiveness . Nothing will induce him to wear his heart upon his sleeve , or , to put the same thing in another way , to talk socialism at the dinner-table . It is the same thing ; that is the point . His gift , his daimon , the thing he has which other politicians have not got , is a faith which makes him go , which is as much part of him as the blood in his veins , and , as little as that , to be made a show of . Here is the second reason for welcoming the testimony of direct contact . The quality my American friend sensed is hard to convey by description or analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDonald felt by the rank and file of his own party and , resentfully , in the last resort , by any and every critic in it , of whom there are plenty ; of the exasperated hostility with which he is derided by Liberals and Tories , who can not understand it ; and of the bitter and unrelenting campaign directed against him by the communists in Moscow and elsewhere . It made him from 1914 to 1922 the target of an abuse such as no one since Gladstone has had to meet and , , at the same time , defeated every effort in those years to keep him out of the lime-light . It helped to give a special luster to his brief premiership and a sense of catastrophe to his fall . The one short word we have to indicate the quality is genius ; but that overworked expression does not , of itself , tell one much , and helps not at all to particularize the thing MacDonald possesses . Perhaps one can get nearest by a comparison . In personal magnetism , assisted in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in a certain baffling aloofness , maddening to colleagues , in intellectual power and in intellectual limitation , and in oratorical command , there are close resemblances ( as well as minor suggestive differences ) between Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Gladstone . But there is one remarkable distinction between them . Gladstone , dying in ' 1895 , entirely failed to see that the creative phenomenon of the time , in Europe , and above all in Britain , was the awakening selfconsciousness of the working class and the stirring of a revolt against commercialism that affected all classes . Mr. MacDonald had , by the time he entered his thirties , grasped this fact and equipped himself in relation to it . If it is true of Gladstone , as a modern historian has put it , that " there was no great thing he did or wanted to do , " it is not true of MacDonald . A vision of a great thing to be done brought him into politics , has colored all his work , and has been conveyed , by him , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his thinking and of his speak- ing derives from their connection with a central idea . No such idea has visited his parliamentary competitors . Discontinuity speaks from voice and action of the most brilliant of them , Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston Churchill . The dreams of the boy color the life of the man . In his formative years of poverty in Lossiemouth , young Ramsay MacDonald fed his imagination with the legends , stories , and ballads told him by a remarkable grandmother , learned a fundamental realism and sincerity toward life from a no less remarkable mother , and , in his brief school-days , devoured every book on science on which he could lay his hands . When at eighteen he came up to London he was determined to be a scientist . An illness deflected him ; but scientific training gave him , for good and all , his socialist method . He was and remains an evolutionist . For him society is a growth ; proceeds by adaptation , not by destruction . Looking at the facts and forces of the nineties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set his hand to building a new party to express the new ideas permeating the minds of then isolated groups and bring them into vital contact with the organized trade-unions . Those who were there know that it was in the main to the determination , energy , and patience of its young secretary that the creation of the Labor party in 1900 was due ; know too that but for MacDonald the first victories of the new party at the 1906 election would have been impossible . He created a new party . More , he gave that party not only a program but a philosophy . The British Labor party is socialist ; since 1918 , when its constitution was amended to include " workers by hand and brain , " broadly socialist ; since 1925 , when a new program of action based on " avowedly Socialist principles " was indorsed , specifically so . The socialism of the British Labor party is evolutionary , scientific , and democratic . MacDonald has been the main force in making and keeping it so . His has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keir Hardie hailed the new recruit as its " greatest intellectual asset . " Then he brought with him a connected and coherent social philosophy , which has been deepened and enriched by experience but not essentially changed . The views set out in " Socialism and Society " ( 1908 ) or " Socialism and Government " ( 1909 ) are the views of " Socialism : Critical and Constructive " ( 1921 ) ; they are the views he has impressed on the mind of his party . He has suffered for his consistency , and the party has profited by his suffering . Thus , believing as he did in reason and cooperation as the instruments of social and national development , he was a pacifist before 1914 and in 1914 stood on his position . He could , in the fatal JulyAugust days , have entered the war government . He refused and , instead , went out into the wilderness . He held a section of the party stanch and at the same time held it back from self-righteous sectarianism ; in 1918 , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British Labor and resist the communist wave that split every socialist party on the Continent . He fought communism  | as he had fought militarism in Britain with argument and logic ? above all with a positive socialist philosophy ? and beat it . More than that , he was able to hold British Labor true to the internationalism taught it by the pacifist section , with the result that to-day the Labor party is in the unique position of never having seen red about Russia , either for or against .. This consistent belief of his in cooperation and consent is the key to his success as a foreign minister . It was an even more important asset than his unique knowledge of foreign countries and conditions . Discussion of the achievements of Britain 's first Labor government is frequently wide of the mark because the premises are not truly stated . The government was , from the start , in a one-to-three minority . It was let in by Liberals and Tories who believed that Europe would break it . MacDonald assumed office because no socialist can refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be done . At the Albert Hall in January , 1924 , he said , " We believe we can give peace to Europe . " He knew , as every one did who thought about it , that until peace was given to Europe there was no constructive thing anywhere that could be begun . The ground had to be cleared off . His own realism was complete . He knew too that he could do it , and how . In office he used the weapons , and only the weapons , he had consistently advocated out of it ? cooperation , good-will , frankness , and friendliness . He did not talk of the British army and navy ; he relied on idealism , and it worked , as it will , when single-mindedly pursued . Nine times out of ten the idealist excommunicates himself because , at the test of action , his mind pays tribute to the materialist illusion . MacDonald 's did not . He knew his facts , and he knew in what he believed . The London settlement ended the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a partial fruit of the new method ; the Geneva Protocol would have been a more complete one . When he had reconciled France and Germany , MacDonald turned to Russia . Idealism again , if you will . There was and is much in Russia he did not like , but " Russia exists . " Europe is a family ; its members have got to live together . " We are not to be our own judges , here or hereafter . " The Russian treaties were an essential part of his peace policy . When the Liberals allied themselves with the Tories against the treaties , they made the general election of 1924 inevitable ; when they entered into a pact with the Tories , they made its result inevitable . Inevitable , but not permanent . The great Tory majority of November , 1924 , is already visibly breaking up . Every by-election since has registered the rising tide of Labor sympathy . In the biography of his wife published in 1911 , Ramsay MacDonald told the world as much as he desired any one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon in many ways and in none more so than in its obliteration of the personality of the author . It is a picture of Margaret Ethel MacDonald , not of her husband . What it tells us about him is , in the main , the curious fact that it was , and is , as natural to him  | to speak to the world as it is unnatural to speak to any individual . Parsimonious in the small change of affection to the living , he can overflow with generous appreciation of the dead . Death moves something primitive in him , for here again he is a Scot and walks near the great mysteries and simplicities , achieves poetry in his prose when he writes or speaks of them . Moreover death , apart from ceremonial aspects which appeal to him , is the great separator , the great revealer of individuality . MacDonald is a singularly definite individual himself ; perhaps for that reason he is little interested in or aware of the individualities of others . He has no talent for intimacy , and lacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , though he possesses in high degree the power of creating group attachment . People complain that he is hard to talk to ; and most of his difficulties , as premier , were due to a misplaced and childish secretiveness about small things . For instance , he mentioned to no one that an old friend had given him a motor-car , though , had he done so at the time , every one would have been glad to know that an overworked and underpaid public servant ( a British prime minister gets ? 3500 a year after income tax has been deducted ) had been secured this measure of relief . Nor did he tell any one that , when he went out of office , he gave up both the car and its endowment . This mystery-mongering of his is the more irritating since , in all larger matters , his honesty and sincerity are transparent . He has nothing to conceal . Scandal has never touched him . In more than thirty years of public life , no one has ever found any failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him immune to ordinary temptations of ambition . The critics on his hearth fulminate , in the main , against his patience , and the fact that the trumpet has never been his instrument . He does not believe that the walls of Capitalism will topple at its breath . Dazzled by the goal , they are impatient of the road , and annoyed by his insistence that " the space between the is ' and the isto-be ' has got to be traveled . " The rise of the party has been so rapid that they understate the solidity and strength of the resistance to it presented by habit , the actual organization of society , and the fears which their own ill considered , illogical , and ill tempered vociferations excite . Between his cautious reasonableness with its tender respect for tradition and romantic delight in beauty of form , and their impassioned unreasonableness , there is a constant internal warfare . It constitutes his major obstacle in the task of converting opinion . No one knows that better than he . The life of no leader of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adequately enough stuffed with thorns to satisfy the bitterest of his opponents or the most captious of his friends . Presumably he finds consolation in the fact , which acts as the final exasperation of his critics , that they know , even better than he knows , that the future of Labor in Britain is as closely tied up with him as its past has been . He made Labor government possible in 1924 ; he makes it possible , even probable , in 1928 or 1929.  |
