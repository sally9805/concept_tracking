Mrs. Edward Everett ( Dolly ) Gann , Second Lady of the Land , last week set-at rest the misgivings of temperate Christian women . Mrs. Ludie D. Pickett , president of the Kentucky W. C. T. U. , having heard that Mrs. Gann dined last month at the British Embassy , wrote and asked : " Is the honor and dignity of your country as dear to you as your own status in the social life of Washington ? Did you for the honor and dignity of your country decline liquor at Sir Esme Howard 's dinner ? " <P> Replied Mrs. Gann : " I did decline . . . . Out of consideration for my own country and my brother I feel that the proper thing for me to do at all times is to decline . " <P> Mrs. Gann 's brother , Vice President Charles Curtis , continued last week to " rest up " between sessions of Congress . Once a jockey , he will go down in history as the Vice President ( or as the President , if anything should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse races , just as Grover Cleveland liked duckshooting , Calvin Coolidge fishing , Herbert Hoover building toy dams . In the minds of many a temperate Christian woman , horse-racing is almost as iniquitous as liquor but so far no prying soul has disturbed the Vice President 's innocent pleasure . During the Spring he went frequently to the Maryland tracks , Bowie , Pimlico , Havre de Grace . He could not get away for the Kentucky Derby , but was on hand to see Blue Larkspur win the American Classic last fortnight at Arlington Park , near Chicago . <P> Last week he visited Albert Davis Lasker , onetime chairman of the U. S. Shipping Board , at his Chicago home . He walked around the private Lasker golf links but swung no club . Newsmen asked him why he did not play . " I do n't like golf , " replied the Vice President who likes to watch horse-racing.
