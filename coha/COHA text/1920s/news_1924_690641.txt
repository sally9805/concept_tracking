txt John W. Davis , Democratic nominee for President , addressed a large and enthusiastic audience in Dexter Park Pavillon in the Stock Yards tonight . The hall , the largest In Chicago 's south side , was filled to its capacity of 12.000 . In his speech . which was frequently interrupted by cheering , Mr. Davis said that he was ready to fight the campaign on one issue , the Republican record in office for the past three and a half years , and then proceeded to attack that record , beginning with the " march of the buccaneers " on Washington in March , 1921 , with . Secretary Fall " at their head " and Sinclair and Dohcny " in the sidelines . " ? Mr. Davis received a cordial welcome on his return to Chicago today . A cheering crowd met him at the La Salle Street Station , and thousands cheered him as he was driven to the City Hall to meet Mayor Dever . This was all in marked contrast to his " unofficial " visit here two weeks ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tour of the Western States . The meeting tonight gave Mr. Davis a great reception . All the Democratic leaders were present . There were George E. Brennan , who succeeded Roger Sullivan as leader of the Illinois Democracy and who led the anti-Klan fight at the New York Convention ; Mayor William E. Dever , Norman L. Jones , candidate for Governor ; Colonel A. A. Sprague , candidate for United States Senator , with such local celebrities as State Committeeman " Hinky Dinh " and Alderman " Bathhouse John " Coughlin . Delegates from each of Chicago 's fifty wards , occupied /sections In the gallery . Nearly every delegation marched in headed by a band , and there was a tremendous amount of noise and much cheering for various local candidates before Mr. Davis arrived at 8:30 o'clock . Crowd Cheers Darls 's Appearance . Tile crowd redoubled its enthusiasm and noise when Mr. Davis appeared on the platform , entrenched by Mayor Dever and Martin J. O'Brien , Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee . Not since the demonstration for Governor Alfred E. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much noise at a Democratic gathering . The demonstration may not have been entirely spontaneous , but if Mr. Brennan , . as reported , issued instructions to the Chicago Democrats to give Mr. Davis a rousing welcome , it certainly indicated an effective organization . Mr. Davis was introduced by Mayor ' Dever . It was striking commentary on the change in sentiment In Chicago from four years ago that a reference to Woodrow Wilson brought every man and woman in the audience to their feet cheering . There was another demonstration when Mr. Davis stepped to the front of the platform , ' which Mayor Dever finally checked by pounding with his gavel . Mr. Davis made an , im.nediate hit with his audience . " A welcome like that , " Ile said , " would warm the coldest candidate that ever ran for President , or the coolest man who ever sat in the Presidential chair . " Mr. Davis declared at the outset that his Western trip had been a complete success and expressed confidence in the victory of the Democratic national ticket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic en- thusinsm and Democratic unity from one end of the country to the other , " he said . " I invite you to contrast that picture with the divided and discordant hosts that now oppose us . " The responsiveness of the crowd apparently had its effect on Mr. Davis . for he launched into an attack on the Republican Party with more vigor and humor than usual . " I ' do n't know what Pd do for purposes of debate , if it was n't for a distinguished citizen of Chicago . " he said . " It is well for any ticket to have at least one vocal - member . " Our Republican adversaries are divided into two warring camps , sometimes called the Left and , the- Right , sometimes the Regular and the Insurgents , but if we choose to adopt the adjective they have ' fastened on themseivee . I should call one the cold and the other the hot , end if we can believe what General Dawes says the hot is red hot at that . ' And ellen I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old story of the nervous lady who gaped the gruff decithand on a Mississippi steamboat whether he thought the vessel was entirely safe . " ' Well , madam , ' he said , ant sorry that I can not reassure you , but she is a leaky old tub and may sink at any minute , and , not only that . but . her boilers are bad and I do not know when they are going to blow up . ' " And to my Republican friends who are wondering tonight whether they prefer to sink with the cool end of their party or blow up with the , hot . I want , to commend the language di that good old hymn . ' Leave the poor old sinking wreck and pull for the shore . ' Attacks Republican ' Record . " General Dawes has said that the Democratic Party has too many issues . / am willing to stand upon only one . and that is the record of the Republican Party for the last three and a half years . " Applause interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words " Teapot Dome . " " A band of buccaneers ' swept into Washington in 1921 , " he continued . " Who is that on a gray horse riding at their head ? " " Sinclair , " shouted a man in the audience . " No. he was only a Lieutenant . " replied Mr. Davis , " the man was the Secretary of the Interior , Albert B. Fall . By his side rode Sinclair with a bundle of bonds under his arm and Doheny with a little black satchel tied to his saddle bow . " Mr. Davis took the reference Mayor Dever had made to Woodrow Wilson and made a brief summary of his achievements and those of his Administration . - and who " preached human libel " ) , in a voice that was heard around the world . " " Poland , that had been for years in prison , heard and there rose again a nation among the nations of the world , " he said . " Czechoslovakia heard as well , and in my Judgment the progress which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road of independence is due to more than any other one thing , to the great principles of selfdetermination that Woodrow Wilson sent shaking throughout the world . " The men and women in the-audience , many of them of Irish descent , showed approval of this sentiment by their applause . " Perigees Liberty " le Cheered . A tremendous outburst of diners greeted a declaration by Mr. Davis for " personal liberty . " the audience interpreting it as favorable to the modification of the prohibition laws . Mr. Davis made this declaration in his customary reference to " human equality , personal liberty and popular sovereignty " as the " three great principles of the Democratic Party . " " Personal liberty , " Mr. Davis said by Way of preface to a discussion of the second principle . It was some time before he was able to continue . He was interrupted by a spontaneous burst of cheering which was long continued and genuinely enthusiastic . The Democratic Party in Chicago ; as in New York City , is proverbtally " wet , " arid the applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is life in the old words yet , " Mr. Davis said smiling during a brief lull in the cheering . " Light wines and . beer . John . " called a voice , causing another outburst , a band began to play " A Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight . " After the applause , had subsided , Mr. Davis began to enumerate the " bill of rights . " His declaration fur " freedom of religion " brought much applause , but it was mild to that which greeted " freedom from , search and seizure . " This also was interpreted as referring to prohibition enforcement . " Personal liberty , " Mr. Davis said . " those unalienable ' rights of freedom of the person : freedom of speech , which means the right to say things governments do not like just as well as things they do ; freedom the - press : freedom of religious worship and practice : free- ! dom from untawful search and seizure : private trial by ? jury , and all those other inalienable rights guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( applause ) and not to be taken from him by any number of people , not by a Majority of a popular vote or a majority in the Legislature , or even in the House of Congress . " And . last of all  --  if you will divide time with me  --  last of all ' Popular sovereignty . What do we mean by that ? A Government of , for and by part of the people ? No . A Government of , for and by all the people . And whenever any group of men assume to take to themselves the domination of the Government of the United States or of any State and use it for purposes of their own personal profit and advancement , they infringe that great principle : and it is the duty of the American people to drive them from the seats they have disgraced . " Now , you ask me what all this has to do with polities. if that Is Americanism  --  and both parties and all parties claim to he American-1 have no doubt that in the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , I may differ from them , there are men and women who believe themselves to be as trulyAmerican as I or any other man  --  but if . you ask me tonight why I ant a Democrat I answer that it is because I believe the old party has throughout its history cleaved closer to the line of these great principles and beee more truly guided by them than any other party that ever was . organiz-:d in our entire history . I believe the Democratic Party is truly 100 per cent . American . . Mr. Davis . in reply to the assertion of General Dawes that President . Coolidge stood on his record of ' achievement . recalled that Congress passed a bonus bill which the President vetoed and then . passed it over his veto . " Whose achievement was that ? " he asked . and continued : " It was vetoed and passed by Congress over the Executive . " " We come to the question of tax reduction , and a bill was offered to Congress under the nature of the Mellon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead a bill framed by Democrats , sponsored by Democrats , defended by Democrats and passed largely by Democratic ' votes . It was signed with reluctance and under protest , arid the difference in one word between that bill and the Mellon plan was that on all incomes over $B7.000 a year , the Mellon plan made a reduction of 50 per cent . and on all under that figure . 25 per cent . I suppose that in round numbers the Democratic measure which was fully passed reversed that situation and on all over $87,000 gave 25 per cent . and on all under 50 per cent reduction , Which of those measures was an achievement ? Recalls World Court Demand . " The Executive demanded from Congress . in language following that of his predecessor , that American adherence to the World Court should be declared , and the only response was that twO membere of his own party rose up to repudiate the plan endorsed and offered another in its stead . " Was that an Executive achievement ? " But when a committee wan organized under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of Michigan to investigate the Internal Revenue Bureau and the administration of the Prohibition Department their efforts to investigate were denounced from the White House as an unwarranted intrusion ? " Was that an achievement ? " Now , my friends , when I run down this list of errors  --  or worse  --  and all these shoete.omings : and when I read in their defense that , notwithstanding all this , a budget system has been installed , I can only think of the old story of when , around the coffin of the meanest man in town , his neighbors assembled to pay hint such tribute of respect as their consciences would permit , and when silence had become embarrassing one charitable fellow who could bear It no longer said- he wanted to say at least this for Brother Jim : ' That he was not as mean always as he was most of the time . ' " Colonel Sprague and Mr. Jones followed Mr. Davis as speakers , practically all of the audience remaining to hear the candidates for Senator and Governor . Gets Warm Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats much different from what it was on his last Visit a. little more than twoweeks ago . At that time MI- . Davis slipped into town almost - unnoticed . Today a cheering crowd of thousands met him at the La Salle Street Station and ether thousands cheered him as he went by automobile to call on Mayor William E. Dever at the City Hall . Mr. Davis was met by . a committee headed by George E. Brennan , Illinois Democratic leader ; Colonel A. ' A. Sprague , nominee for United States Senator ; County Chairman Martin J. O'Brien . and Michael L. Igoe. candidate Mr. Davis winced slightly as Mr. for State 's Attorney . Brennan shook his hand and explained that his right arm was still sore from the shaking it received at the barbecue on the farm of Dr. Arthur ' W. Nelson , Democratic candidate for Governor of Missouri . " I hurt it at the Battle of Bunceton , " Mr. Davis said smiling . " It is not serious and will be all right after a , day or two . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of automobiles carrying Mr. Davis and his party and proceeded along La Salle Street to the City Hall . Nearly every window in the stores and office buildings were crowded with spectators , and the crowds that lined the curb cheered as Mr. Davis drove by . Yards of ticker tape - were thrown front many office windows , and the reception to the candidate was one of the most enthusiastic lie has yet encountered . ... Mayor Says Davis If Optimistic . At City Hall Mr. Davis was introduced to Mayor Dever by Mr. Igoe . The candidate and the Mayor chatted for a few minutes about the political situation . and the Mayor said afterward that Mr. Davit seemed decidedly optimistic .
