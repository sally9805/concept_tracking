txt In the new edition of the British naval publication , " The Return of Fleets . " in which a painstaking effort is made to assemble comparative warship values , it Is revealed that in the 10,000-ton Trento and Trieste , now building , the Italians will have the fastest cruisers in the world . They are designed to steam 36 knots . To attain such speed 150,000 horsepower must be provided . That of Great Britain 's battle cruiser Hood , 41,200 tons displacement , Is only 6,000 less . The Hood 's speed has been given out as 31 knots , but she is faster . The speed of the best of the ten new United States cruisers is approximately 34 knots . France is aiming at the same mark in the cruisers she is now building . Just how swift the new Japanese are to be " The Return of Fleets " can not tell , for it is a secret It Is reported , however , that they will carry twelve 8-inch guns , which would make them much more formidable than our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve guns are 6-inch . It may be assumed , although this publication gives no details , that the five British cruisers of the Kent class will be heavily armed and as fast as their designers can make them . In laying down the eight new cruisers the United States will have an opportunity to enter the competition . Ships of 10,000 tons and carrying 8-inch guns , the limits set by the Washington naval treaty , should be important factors in a sea fight in which dreadnoughts would be slow by comparison . One of the naval lessons of the World War was the importance of mine-sweepers . In 3914 they had no rating as an individual class . Great Britain today has a long lead in this unit : sixty-two to forty-five for the United States , forty for Italy and twenty-nine for France . Japan is beginning to build mine:sweepers . It is again pointed out that the United States has a great superiority in destroyers , most of which were built in the war period . The total given is 309. but this has to be scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . which is twelve years . Fourteen have been converted into mine-sweepers and t .. ? enty have been transferred to the Coast Guard . Moreover , many of our destroyers are out of commission and in the hands of i caretakers . With the exception or four Australian boats no British destroyer is twelve years old . Still , the United States is far ahead in this unit , not only as regards numbers available but as regards design . Much is made in " The Return of Fleets " of the fact that Great Britain completed only one cruiser in 1924. as compared with four - for the United States and one for Japan . In 1923 the score stood : Great Britain 0 , America 5 , Japan 3 . Great Britain was far In the lead with cruisers when the United States began to lay down modern ships . Admiral CooNrz 's flagship in the Pacific , the Seattle , is a cruiser that was completed nineteen years ago . Fifteen is the British life limit for cruisers . Only ten British cruisers are over age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the : United States had no really modern ships until the Detroit class was commissioned . When the eight cruisers authorized are under the flag American strength in this unit will be Impressive . A case might be made out for British need of " up-to-date " destroyers . Her designers are inactive while boats are passing into the obsolete stage . Japan has eight building , while fifteen others are authorized . The Japanese destroyers will be of greater power than the existing British , and they will be armed with four 4.7-Inch guns . France is also adding large destroyers to her fleet . eighteen being under construction and eighteen more authorized . France , too , is excelling all other countries in planning submarines with a wide radius , Japan is not far behind , and Italy is in the race . The United States has no ambitious program . Great Britain Is proceeding with deliberation . Her experimental submarines , few though they are , give promise of a great advance in effectiveness .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
