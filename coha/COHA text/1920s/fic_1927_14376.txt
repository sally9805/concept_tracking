SIX striped figures on a blazing road , swinging their picks , and four behind piling out the dirt with shovels . The white dust hides the blackberries in the hedge and the willow clumps are bent under its weight . The heat of July shimmers across the wide land as far as the eye can see . The sweat pours down . It is the only dampness in the world for the ten mourners on the road . On a stump to the left a guard squats , drowsy , vapid , like a toad . The rifle in the crook of his arms keep alert , it watches , its muzzle watches like an eye , it threatens . Fall , picks , and heave arms ! On the bankside to the right , another guard sits . He also is sleepy , drowsy . His rifle also keeps alert and watches , its muzzle threatens . The convicts dig with their backs to the guards , their faces set down the infinite stretch of road that disappears in a point on the horizon . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky and bring them down , never any slower , never any faster . And as the picks strike against the earth with a thud , a husky desperate groan bursts from their baked lips . As rhythmic as the beating of their hearts the " hanh " accompanies the falling of the picks , carrying over long maddening hours of pain , carrying over until the sun sinks cooling in the west and the guard stirs and croaks , " Call it a day . " At times their voices are raised in a chant , level , patient , eternal and tough as the earth in which they dig . They do n't talk much , not so much . Talk breaks up the rhythm of labor , and that 's what they 're there for  --  labor , labor , working on the roads . Ninety days on the roads , Tom Sterling , and sixty days for you , Bantam Wilson . The judge dropped his tobacco by his foot , rose and gave sentence . Disturbance of the peace . Assault with intent to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always shooting . They 've got no sense , they 'll never have no sense . Give ' em the law , let ' em feel it . Obedience , peace , peace . This is the republic , these are the institooshuns . Land of our fathers . This shall be a lesson . Sixty days . Ninety days . Dig , dig . Side by side they dig  --  Bantam Wilson and Tom Sterling . Misery has made them friends , sorrow companions . Bantam 's spirit walks unbroken , Sterling is crushed and under . The feel of iron and abuse of tongues have broken him . His great shoulders are bent , his legs hardly sustain his weight , and his arms fling up the pick and let it fall hour after hour , day after day , with slowly decreasing power . See , his face now bends above the lightless earth beneath . These are the children  --  hanh . These are the brethren marching to Canaan Land . The guard on the right stirs in his sleepiness and beats at the flies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog flies stay with you . p. 3 SECOND GUARD ( Lighting cigarette and passing the package on to the first . ) And the dam ' muskeeters allus drilling for water . FIRST GUARD Heigh you , Sterling , raise up that pick and let ' er come down . ( The convicts dig on , accompanying every blow with their everlasting " hanh " , saying never a word . ) You hear me ? I say put some pep into that digging . BANTAM ( After a moment  --  without looking around . ) He sick . Ai n't able to work . SECOND GUARD You bastard monkey runt , who 's talking ? FIRST GUARD Hell ' ll be frozen ' fore you git this little digging done . ( They lapse into silence again . The second guard stretches his arms in a yawn . ) SECOND GUARD Lord , I 'm sleepy  --  sleepy . FIRST GUARD Better leave her off a few nights . ( The convicts with the shovels burst into a snicker . SECOND GUARD ( Brutally , his voice sharp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The four convicts terrified push their shovels deeper into the loose earth and pile it out ) . FIRST GUARD I want water . p. 4 SECOND GUARD The goddamned water boy 's fell in and drownded . ( Standing up and calling ) . Water boy ! Water boy ! Heigh , water jack ! Could a-been there and half way back ! ( The diggers begin a low working chant , pitiful and pleading . " Mercy , mercy , " it calls . " Water , water , give us some water . Where is it ? Where is he ? Where is the Great I Am , the Almighty God ! Listen now , Jesus , while us gi ' you de call . Eigh Lawd , come wid de sponse ! " CONVICTS I called my people  --  hanh , I said my people  --  hanh , I mean my people  --  hanh , Eigh , Lawd ! FIRST GUARD That 's right , sing him out'n the bushes . SECOND GUARD If it ai n't water it 's grub , ai n't that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ ! ( Sterling suddenly tumbles over and falls with his face flat in the dirt . A convulsive shudder runs through the other convicts , but they carry on their digging , never any slower , never any faster . ) CONVICTS . I called my friends  --  hanh , I said my friends  --  hanh , I mean my friends  --  hanh , Eigh , Lawd ! FIRST GUARD ( Springing up as he glances at Sterling ) . Heigh now , none o ' that , none o ' that ! p. 5 BANTAM ( His voice rising in a whine ) . He sick , bad sick ! FIRST GUARD Better got cured fore he come here . ( Marching up to the prostrate body ) . Git that face out'n the dirt ! Git it out . ( Whirling towards Bantam . ) Nobody asked for your jowing . ( Eyeing him ) . Want the little cat-tails ? BANTAM ( Slinging his pick ) . Jesus , Jesus ! FIRST GUARD Snap out'n it , Sterling . SECOND GUARD ( Getting a leather thong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail and rise him . FIRST GUARD Gon na step to it , Sterling ? ( But Sterling makes no answer ) . FIRST GUARD He 's a stall boy . Hell , he 's stalling ! SECOND GUARD Damn right , he 's stalling . FIRST GUARD This ai n't no party . SECOND GUARD Hell it ai n't no party ! ( He smoothes the thong with his hand and looks at the first guard ) . FIRST GUARD Make ' em work , make ' em work  --  that 's right . SECOND GUARD Work , work  --  that 's what they 're here for  --  work ! p. 6 FIRST GUARD Work  --  work  --  let him taste it . SECOND GUARD ( Raising the strap above his head ) . Thirty-nine , thirty-nine . We got our orders . ( His voice coming out stronger now , more sharply ) . The law , the law , it 's wrote in a book . ( But still he holds the leather poised without bringing it down . A low murmur of horror rises among the convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full of begging , but hopeless withal ) . CONVICTS . I called my sister  --  hanh , I said my sister  --  hanh , I mean my sister  --  hanh , Eigh , Lawd ! FIRST GUARD Hold her a minute , we 'll see , we 'll see . ( He goes up to Sterling and pokes him gently in the ribs with the muzzle of his rifle , but only the twitching back makes answer ) . SECOND GUARD Stick him in the collar . ( He cuffs him gently in the collar , then with more insistence , at last with vehement roughness . A low whine is heard ) . He 's saying something . FIRST GUARD ( Bending down ) . Goddamn it we 'll see ! SECOND GUARD And what song is he singing now ? p. 7 FIRST GUARD Do n't say nothing . Moans and whines . He do n't say nothing . SECOND GUARD By God we 'll see . Oh yes , he 'll talk . He 'll tell us a mouthful ! ( The chant grows fuller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rising and falling arms to their labor . The prayer for help , for peace , grows stronger  --  and with it the baffled will , the confused soul sends forth its cry ) . CONVICTS . I called my brother  --  hanh , I said my brother  --  hanh , I mean my brother  --  hanh , Eigh , Lawd ! FIRST GUARD Let him have it . ( The second guard hands his rifle to the first and then looking around the world as if for a witness of justification , begins to beat the prostrate figure . Again a shudder and the gust of a groan sweep the convicts . They drive their picks deeper in the ground , but never any faster , never any slower ) . CONVICTS . I called my mother  --  hanh , I said my mother  --  hanh  --  SECOND GUARD Six  --  seven  --  eight  --  nine  --  ten  --  FIRST GUARD And now you 'll work  --  and I reckon you 'll work . SECOND GUARD Eleven  --  twelve  --  thirteen  --  fourteen  --  ( And the watchers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet earth receive it . Keep it , or save it till he next harvest ) . p. 8 FIRST GUARD Oh yes he 'll work , and I reckon he 'll work . ( The water boy ursts through the hedge at the left , stands terror-stricken a moment , and then dropping is bucket with a clatter tears down the road . The precious water sinks into the dried arth . Now they chant in hopelessness and the four with shovels wag their heads , their arching tongues protrude through baked lips . Ah , hope is no more  --  life is no more - death  --  death all around us . Grave , grave , swallow us up , hide us away , keep us ) . SECOND GUARD Fifteen  --  sixteen  --  seventeen  --  eighteen . ( Now Tom Sterling has eached the end . In a last burst of life he staggers to his feet , his eyes glazed with adness ) . FIRST GUARD Go to work . Look out  --  ( The second guard turns to grab his rifle ut Sterling is upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earth , crushing the stems of the early golden rod by the ditch and tearing the clumps of knotted lady-thumb ) . STERLING ( His voice coming out in a great animal scream ) . Hah  --  hah  --  hah  --  ( He beats the guard 's upturned face with his fists ) . p. 9 SECOND GUARD Kill him ! Kill him ! ( The convicts sing on , now their chant rises louder , fresher . Revenge ! Revenge ! Hope he is not perished from us . Our arms are still strong ) . CONVICTS . I called my father  --  hanh , I said my father  --  hanh , I mean my father  --  hanh , Eigh , Lawd ! SECOND GUARD Kill him ! Kill him ! ( The first guard stands stupefied . Then as if suddenly awakening he steps back , raises his rifle , and shoots Sterling through the back . He rolls over and lies with face upturned in the burning sun . The second guard crawls over to the bank and lies stretched out in the grass , his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard stands looking foolishly down at the dead Negro . The four convicts drop their shovels and hover together in a shuddering group , the six sing on , beaten  --  darkness , night  --  God sits high in heaven , his face from the Negro , his hand towards the white man . The poor and needy stretch their weak hands and the iron palings divide them ) . FIRST GUARD The goddamned fool , he 's dead , dead ! SECOND GUARD ( Sitting up with a high laugh as he wipes the blood from his face ) . Had to kill him , we had to kill ! ( Peering forward ) . Dead as a fly . ( With a sort of wild sob ) . This ai n't right . They 's something wrong  --  something wrong here . p. 10 FIRST GUARD Sing , you bastards . Dig , you sons of bitches ! ( And the body lies still . Once it knew swiftness , legs that ran by the cabin , played in the cornfield . Eyes that knew starlight , knew moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew singing ! And I lay this body down . In the cool hedge the fly says " zoom . " And a buzzard wheels by the flat disc of the sun . And they dig and they sing . O earth , give us answer ! Jesus hear us ! )
