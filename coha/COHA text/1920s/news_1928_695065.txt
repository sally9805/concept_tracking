txt A proposed combination of railroad and airplane service is to ' bring Los Angeles within : 48 hours of New York . The malls are carried inleas time , but that is because the malls are flown at night as well as during the day . The new service will employ trains at ffightrand planes by day . Mr. Kinsley 's recent account of his flight in the mail planes to the Pacific ' coast left no doubt of the discomfort of night travel in the machines row in use . It is to avoid those discomforts that the new air-and  --  rall schedule has been devised . The passe'nger is to take an evening brain from New York . Ho will board the airplane after breakfast the following morning at Columbus , 0 . He rides the plane to Wichita , Kas. , where he finds a berth on a Santa-Fe train . The following morning he is somewhere in New Mexico , where a plane is waiting to take him the rest of the way before nightfall . Chicagoans are in the habit of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not planned to the advantage of Chicago , ' but the proposed new combination brings , New York clOser than Chicago , in point of travel , bag time , to Los Angeles and the Pacific ! coast . If the New York plane stops at Chicago , it will not be at the most advantageous hour . Chicago 's answer , to thiS challenge must be the insuguration of a similar service which will reach Los Angeles hours ahead of the New York schedulei - It is not astonishing that the initiative in establishing this new schedule did not come from Chicago . Chicago has been slow in recognizing the Importance of the airplane ' in spite of the tact that the city is now the hub of the commercial air lines of this country . No one need take credit for great foresight who ventures to predict that air transportation is to become important in the national life . The progress of the air mail removes any doubts on that score .

Chicago , it is true , has not entirely neglected its facilities for airplanes . We Wye a municipal flying field to the west of the city , but all who have studied the question stress the importance of establishing an other one on the lake front , a half mile-south of The Field museum . The south park . board has announced its willingness to build the field and manage it , but the cooperation of . the city government has not been obtained . In these circumstances , . it is remarkable that fie mayor 's committee of citizens , appointed to advise and assist him in just such undertakings , has failed , thus far , to take the Initiative . With a lako front airport , Chicago would have an air terminal superior to that possessed by-any great city in the world . The arrival and departure of planes from the heart of the city would be a continual advertisement of the efficiency and regular . ity of air transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow Col. Lindbergh 's phrase . Thera has been a needless delay of months in starting work on the lake front airport . The mayor 's advisers can put an end to the delay if they press for immediate action .
