December 21 , 1921 THE NEW The man in good clothes gets the front pew and I in my overalls must set back out of sight . God 's warned ' em that they 'll have to suffer for that , but I recken they 've got to where they ca n't believe He do n't admire anybody that looks as fine as they do , and carries around so much money ? think God 's like the preachers , sees the world saved by contributions . " It ai n't only what they do to themselves , bringin ' on their heads the wrath of God ? it 's What they do to me . I ai n't excusin ' myself ? it ai n't right ; but when I see myself set aside in Church , I just naturally get mean and think about what I ought not to . It turns me from God . And that 's the worst thing the rich are doing ? they are turnin ' the poor against the Lord . " Listen here : Ye have dishonored the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they do that , they set him against everything they support , God along with the rest . " And the preachers do n't warn them , seem to have lost sight of the plan themselves . Why , they harder away even what Christ said about its bein ' ntarder for a rich man to enter into heaven than tor a camel to get through a needle 's eye ? which it is no use denyin ' he could n't do . I heard my own preacher doin ' that just lately . What he made ? 11t was that this young man was an exception , had to have special hard treatment to get his heart right , that Christ meant what He said only for him , and not for the rich generally . But I do n't read that Christ said so . " What they 're doin ' wo n't work . When you get a plan laid down you 've got to follow it if 3T011 're goin ' to get anywhere . If they did n't keep 111:7aPPle car on the right track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is never goin ' be the happy place that God meant it should be as that it could be , as long as we 're off the track s We are . Worse than that , unless we get back the , ere 's goin ' to be a big smash ? no way to stop it . Its laid down in the plan . ke " The rich do n't see what 's hangin ' over their 4whats . They do n't know God 's opinion of ' em for they 're doin ; and the preachers ai n't tellin ' 1 .1. , , any more . It 's written down , plain as can be . " The little black book came out again . No re " rnOr of fingers now ? he knew I would stay to ae end . " Listen to this : ' Because thou sayest I 400 , rieh , have gotten riches and have need of knowest not that thou art the wretched and miserable and poor and blind and - natked ! , , oT reckon , Sister , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show Him that He 's REPUBLIC I 0 I wrong about money , that it can save the world . But their plan wo n't work . It ai n't workin ' today . The destruction God warned would follow if they set their mind on riches is on the way . You can hear the rumble of it everywhere . They would hear it themselves but that they 've deafened their ears . " Do n't you sec what we must do , Sister ? We must make ' em listen ? show ' em in love ? make it clear to ' em ? save ' em . It ai n't so much that they are bad as that they do n't see . They have lost their way . I have to tell ' em ? I must have help . You must do your part . Some will listen to me , some to you . Maybe I will get one , maybe you will get one . And they will pass it on . " " All aboard for the : 30 . " The bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistent . " They are calling my train , " I said . " I must go . " He rose with me ? another man ? confident , dominant , even gay . He was freed of his message . He had obeyed the voice . He could go now ? look after his apples , happy until the hour returned , as it would , when he would see another who must hear him . Then again he would go through the pains of delivery . " God bless you , Sister , " he called , as I hastened away . " Pass it on . " And that is what I am doing here . IDA M. TARBELL . Medusa I had come to the house , in a cave of trees Facing a sheer sky Everything moved : a bell hung ready to strike , Sun and reflection wheeled by . When the bare eyes were before me And the hissing hair , Held up at a window , seen through a door , The stiff ' bald eyes , the serpents on the forehead Formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Nothing will ever stir ; The end will never brighten it more than this Nor the rain blur . The water will always fall and will not fall , And the tipped bell make no sound . The grass will be always growing for hay Deep on the ground . And I shall stand here like a shadow Under the great balanced day , My eyes on the yellow dust that was lifting in the wind And does not drift away .
