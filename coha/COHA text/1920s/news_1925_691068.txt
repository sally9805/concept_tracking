txt Directors of the American Petroleum Institute have returned from the special meeting in Atlantic City at which President Coolidge 's program of a governmental body of three Cabinet members , to inquire into conservation methods on oil , was endorr-ed . Members - in attendance were loath to talk about all the things discussed , but were frank in stating that the meeting was one of the most representative gatherings of oil executives yet held by the institute directors . There were five representatives from California , a number from Oklahoma and Texas producing districts and eastern refining companies . Exchanges of opinions among the oil executiv1S , according to one in attendance , brought out the fact that oil company heads are optimistic an the 192.5 outlook for oil . While they regard the situation as growing stronger all the time , some felt a runaway market in crude would not be beneficial in the long run . However , opinion was rather general that higher crude prices are coming soon , due to declining production in the older districts and continued big ' demand .
