Karolyi to Canada <P> A London despatch states that Count Michael Karolyi and family are in Cardiff , Wales , en route for Canada , " where the Count proposes to live his remaining years . " <P> Few political figures in this post-War period have excited such violent controversy as Count Karolyi . <P> His chief claim to notice before the War was his marriage to Countess Katinka Andrassy , a daughter of Count Julius Andrassy , last Foreign Minister of the Dual Monarchy . The Andrassy family is one of the principal pillars of Magyar aristocracy . During the last century a Count Andrassy was Foreign Minister at Vienna , and considered one of the greatest statesmen of his time . Countess Karolyi , granddaughter of this famous statesman , was once considered to be the most beautiful woman in Europe . The beginning and the end of Karolyi 's influence in politics lies between October 31 , 1918 , and March 22. 1919 . It has been written of him that he is the " Pure Fool of Hungary with the accent on the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finding him guilty of high treason . There is no question of accents . Karolyi is either a fool or a traitor ; most probably a fool : At the end of October , 1918 , he formed the Hungarian Provisional National Assembly , and some time later he was elected first and last President of the Hungarian People 's Republic . At this time Hungary was at war with the Allies . Karolyi either surrounded himself , or , more probably was surrounded , by a group of disreputable Hungarians and Jews . It appears that his best defense is that he was the tool of these people . At any rate , when Karolyi and some of his ministers appeared before General Franchet d'Esperey at Belgrade to negotiate armistice terms , the Allied Generalissimo looked scornfully at them and said : " Vous etes juifs ? " Turning to Karolyi he said : " Vous etes tombes si bas ? " Then turning on his heel he left them , declining to negotiate terms of an armistice for Hungary . That was the impression which the Ministers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable , or did not try , to do anything for Hungary . Disaster followed disaster until , on March 22 , 1919 , following a note from Lieutenant Colonel Vyx , representing the Entente , the power of Government was seized by the proletariat , and Karolyi resigned the Presidency of the Republic . " I preferred this sacrifice to assuming the cheap martyrdom of letting them arrest me , because I wanted to avoid bloodshed and mass murder in the streets of Budapest , to spare the country from the worst horrors of civil war " * Nevertheless much blood was spilled . It is significant that the staunchest defense of Karolyi comes from one of his Bolshevik brethern , Professor Jaszi-Jakabo-vics in a most unreliable book on the revolution . Karolyi fled to Gablonz in Czecho-Slovakia after his resignation , thence to Austria , and on to Italy , whence he was forced to go to Yugo-Slavia . Now he is about to settle in Canada . <P> *KABQLTI'S.DEFENSE. -ArJjeiter-Zeitung of Vienna , July 25 ,             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
