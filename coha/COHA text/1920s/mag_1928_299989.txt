Minneapolis likes conventions . She gives them assembly halls , sleeping quarters , bands , singers , victuals , drinks , newspaper attention . And conventions like Minneapolis . One hundred and sixty two have met there so far this year ; 29 more are scheduled . Last week the American Dental Association was there , with 8,000 members . They enjoyed themselves , reheard old information , learned some things new . <P> Women Patients . In foyers , away from the mass meetings , the men discussed what to do with prudish or amorous women patients . The best conduct , by general approval , is to treat the woman impersonally , as if she were a mere head of beef . Let the prude bring in a companion ; let the companion sit guard in an uncomfortable iron chair . Many women become amorous as they recline in the dentist 's chair . The prudent dentist hurts such patients enough to make them forget their involuntary eroticism . All agreed that the practitioner who coos to female clients is a fool . <P> Women Dentists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Some 50 attended this convention . Until 1836 dental schools would not let women study . <P> Helpers . Dentists again complained of lack of trained laboratory technicians , office assistants , hygienists ; urged women to learn those semi-professions ; urged schools to provide courses ; damned hastily , imperfectly educated mechanical dentists . <P> Cigarets . At cigaret-smoking dentists Dr. Isador Hirschfeld of Manhattan stared reprovingly . Cigaret smoking , he stated , has a deleterious effect on the tissues of the mouth , predisposing them to " trench mouth " ( Vincent 's Disease ) . He linked together the recent increase of this infectious disease with the increase of U. S. cigaret smoking ( 8,000,000,000 cigarets in 1910 ; 97,000,000,000 in 1927 ) . Women cigaret smokers , according to him , are falling sick in more &; more numbers . Kissing spreads the disease . But more usual than smoking or kissing as predisposing causes are fatigue , systemic disease , dental irregularities , insufficient chewing , lack of hygiene , injury to gums . <P> Unclean Mouth . " Any mouth that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that retains decayed teeth , deposits on the teeth , diseased roots . Bacteria are starved by cleansing the mouth and the tissues are fed by stimulating the circulation which brushing gives . " - Dr . Frederick Bricker of Hollywood , Calif . Results of unclean mouths : " Anemia , appendicitis , gastritis , nephritis , cystitis , myocarditis , iritis , encephalitis , gastric ulcers and a nasty disposition . " <P> Decay . Nineteen out of 20 school children in North America , England , Germany and Switzerland , have decayed teeth , an estimate indicates . In some places every child is suffering . <P> Jaw Power . Teeth are slightly loose in the jaws . They swivel and play a trifle . They need exercise . Industrious chewing is the best exercise . Most people , who pay attention to their health , know this . Few , however , know that they must put at least 1,700 pounds of pressure into each day 's biting , chewing . Dr. Thomas Hartzell of Minneapolis says so . Thorough mastication requires 5,000 pounds of pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift a 7-passenger motor car .
