The serious condition which has been brought about in the Supreme Court by the overwhelming number and complexity of cases which the Court must hear , was called to the attention of the New York Bar Association by Solicitor General James M. Beck . According to Mr. Beck the Court literally does ten times as much work as it did in the days of Chief Justice Marshall . He regards the pressure under which the Court works as a dangerous condition . <P> A bill sponsored by Chief Justice Taft has already ben introduced into Congress to relieve this condition . The object of the bill is to make all appeals , except those in certain kinds of cases , " as of grace and not of right . " In other words , the Court will have the right to go over the cases presented and select for consideration only those which it considers important . By this means the Court will be able to secure the leisure necessary for the proper consideration of its important decisions .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
