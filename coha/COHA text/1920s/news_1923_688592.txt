txt The first principles in a financial readjustment are the forcing of the best possible terms upon the debtor and then the prompt acceptance of his best offer . Even in cases of mercantile bankruptcy it has long been recognized that the debtor 's first offer is always the best . Staggering under the heaviest taxation and the heaviest national indebtedness arising from the war , Great Britain promptly steps forward and offers to pay her war debt to the United . States in full with an interest rate of better than 3% . The terms should be promptly accepted by the government and people of the United States and with appreciation . A Nomx : EXAMPLE In this leadership in debt payment Great Britain is helping the United States to collect from other nations and is assuming 20% of our national debt . Yet her population is less than 40% of that of the United States and her national wealth only about 30% of that estimate for the United States . Her action is most magnanimous and ? a wholesome example before the whole world . Assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebtedness , the United States , without payment of the six billions due from other nations , would have a national debt of only eighteen billions , or less than one hundred and eighty dollars per capita , which is about eight hundred dollars per average family of four and one-half persons . The debt of Great Britain is over nine hundred dollars per capita , or four thousand dollars per family . Recognition of the sacredness of war debts is a primary essential for the maintenance of world peace . International credit may yet be found the greatest measure for national defense . Future wars may be indefinitely postponed when it is found that the credit of the world is open to a nation of honor wrongfully attacked . As in war , so in peace , honor is first and highest with Great Britain . She could have divided the world with Germany , but considered herself in honor bound to defend the weaker states of Belgium and France . Whoever holds her promise will receive interest and principal to the last farthing . It is to the shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per annum upon this war obligation of our brother and ally . ARE WE SAVLOCKB TO OUR ' WAR PARTNERS , At first it ? was propoked at Washington to . charge 51/2% , although we borrowed the money at fer less than that , or indeed at about 31,4% if one considers the return to the United States Treasury of parts of the interest be income taxes . Unless we are willing to stand under the imputation of playing the Shylock to our war partners , we should rebate as now proposed the interest already charged Great Britain to the original understanding of a cost without plus basis . The people of the United ' States have never made any movement to hasten the collection of this indebtedness . The activity and the movement for payment has been more on the part of Great Britain , whose ' people have been restless by reason of the indefinite character of the debt . Without demand from the United States , England has been shipping geld for payment on account . The Washington authorities have , asked if the $50,000,000 paid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or interest , and the British reply has been : " The future will have to determine , especially if you still insist upon ri " - . You are the dictators . We should prefer a lower rate and a more definite understanding , but it is not for the debtor to make the terms . " ? The public has never been given all the facts concerning the English indebtedness to the United States Treasury . The first advances to Great Britain were on memoranda , which were later taken up , principal and interest , and new two-year notes were given hearing 5 Cre interest , maturing last April and May . Three times the British authorities offered to send a mission to us with endeavor to reach renewal adjustment , and at least twice they were told to wait . Meanwhile Washington passed a law creating an international debt commission , but without authority to name a lower rate than 4 /4% or a shorter maturity than twenty-five years , which might be interpreted as a twenty-five year extension , with no payment on principal or interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been adjusted by the commission on this basis . WHY NOT A DOUBLE DEBT CANCELLATION ? But the British made no quibbles . They stated the facts of their condition and financial obligations and the burdens they were under and asked for fair consideration , expressing a desire to begin payment promptly . They noted that they had certain properties in the United States that they desired to turn over in cancellation of indebtedness ; and furthermore would like the privilege of accumulating balances and United States government bonds to be turned into the Washington treasury in cancellation of the British indebtedness , principal and interest  --  a double debt cancellation . THE HISTORY OF INTEREST naTits The ground-work of this settlement that has now been arrived at between the representatives of the two nations and that soon will await the approval of Congress , is in the history of interest rates following ' great ' wars . Statistical tables show that over a series of fifty years following great wars the interest rate for money has been higher for some years immediately following and then gradually lower for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that instead of the British paying a higher rate for ten to twenty years and the lower rate later , that the lower rate be brought forward and adopted for the earlier period . Hence the terms agreed to at the conference in Washington ? : . ' " - for ten years and 31 , : s ' ; ' , . for the balance thereafter . This is somewhat higher than the interest rate for the fifty years following the great wars , which has been computed historically as balancing out at ** THE STAGGERING LOAD The worth of Great Britain , excluding Ireland , is estimated at just under 4:20,000,000.000 , sterling and with no new sources of wealth in natural resources to uncover . She can find no commercial oil and her coal measures must be sought at greater depth . Her people love the island and the ocean , and do not desire to live in distant Australia or cold Canada . Only the direst poverty will force them to emigrate . They would rather stay at home and suffer less nourishment and smaller families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is going to be very hard for us to pay . Our population must fall , because babies will not be born or nourished as heretofore and our people will not emigrate . " If our indebtedness were owed outside the country , our case would he hopeless . As it is , we take back in taxes part of the interest payments and then by inheritance taxes in two or three transfers we take back the whole debt . " Very few people appreciate the disaster the war brought upon us . Our best young leaders and our best men were the first to fall and we have lost by the war a large measure of the spirit of enterprise in foreign lands . " Our national income in savings before the war was but ? 350,000,000 per annum and the war has added to our national taxation far more than our former national bavings . " ENGLAND PAYS AND CABBIES ON Anyone who has touched the spirit of Englund during and since the war Must realize that the national and family spirit is to mentally minimize the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? the ultimate triumph of right and honor , to still " carry on . " Other nations cry out for short hours of work , for defense from without and for outside financial assistance , but John Bull leads off in the spirit of self-help ; steps up to the captain 's office and asks fox his bill . We should recognize the spirit , make sure we do not overcharge and say , " Brother John , when again in trouble in a righteous cause , or in the interest of fair play trying to help out the under-dog , come again .
