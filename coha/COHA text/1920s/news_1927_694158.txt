txt Time rolled back ten years for 600 members of the American Legion who sailed at midnight on the steamship President Harding as the vanguard of the thousands bound for the organization 's convention in Paris next month . Coming aboard with their women folk , including 17 French war brides , the veterans talked only of the difference between this embarkation and that of ten years ago , when they were crowded below decks in darkness until the ship cleared the harbor . Luxurious appointments of the President Harding were compared with accommodations of troop ships . Nine other sailings will take place from Saturday to Aug. 27 , to give the Legionnaires opportunity ' to tour Europe before the ? convention opens . Most of the 17,000 who have made reservations will sail between Sept. 2 and 10 , and the Leviathan , bearing Gen. Pershing , Commander Howard and more than 2,000 Legionnaires , will depart on Sept. 10 . Thirty antics were rdpresented by the group which sailed tonight .               @ @ @ @ @ @
