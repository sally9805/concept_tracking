PRIMA DONNA-Pitts Sanborn-Longmans , Green , 2 vols. ( $5 ) . <P> Seven men and music make the story of Helma Seymour , a pretentious life cycle of a U. S. prima donna which begins in a mid-western town and revolves ironically to a prosperous and almost respectable middle-age . <P> Helma was an offish , disdainful girl , daughter of a lawyer in Byzantium , Ohio . She went to the local college where a freshwater esthete named Winfield Gaines ( but called " Phoebe " ) was her friend until he was expelled . She studied singing with a local teacher who had a book called Lyra Operatica , full of stilted engravings of old singers in the pinched and flowing costumes of classic roles . She herself had a big rich voice . It was for church-singing , perhaps someday teaching . Certainly not for the sinful ways of opera . But when her father and mother died , Helma went to New York . <P> There Dubosc was her teacher and Gonsalvo her constant companion . Dubosc realized her capabilities , pointed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a half-crazed creature , without ambition , almost without voice , whom Dubosc mercifully took to Paris . There she met Raymond who was young . They lived together , went to Tours together where Dubosc had arranged for Helma 's apprenticeship . In Tours she was soon the prima donna , successful because she was healthy , worked hard , sang splendidly . John O'Brien , a visiting tenor , heard her , got her an engagement in Paris . Then came the problem of Raymond . A young singer at the Paris Opera should have no handicaps . Raymond , fortunately , understood this . Helma 's next episode was Ravet . <P> Ravet was a giantish man from the mountains of Dauphine . He knew nothing of singing but he knew the stage and passionately probed all the great roles to their depths . He too loved Helma and had much to give . He gave it all and died . And Helma went on alone , only she was taller than before , and an artist . <P> Helma 's was then , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ravet 's death . She thought she needed Raymond again and went to Biarritz to find him . But he had married without telling her , grown heavy , gone into business and was fathering a family . She fled to Buenos Aires and on board ship she married de Laurac who , she discovered later , preferred to her a slovenish bourgeoise who bore him children . <P> De Laurac was divorced and in the War he died . Helma came to the U. S. to the Metropolitan Opera Company . There critics thought her a little cold but her prestige grew as it had in Europe . Her sole defeat was a trip to Mexico City under none other than Impresario Gonsalvo . She had been tempted by the offer of the highest fee ever paid a woman singer . But she offended the politician-backer , sang badly and had to be hustled out of the city to save her skin . The experience shook her confidence , ruined Gonsalvo . For Gonsalvo she magnanimously provided , for herself there was Ashley Jocelyn , considerate , correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
