DOCTOR ARNOLD or RUGBY-Arnold Whitridge-Holt ( $3.00 ) . In Tom Brown 's School-Days Thomas Arnold is immortalized as the formidable headmaster , rex atque sacerdos . In his son Matthew 's ode on Rugby Chapel he stands with " radiant vigor . " In Dean Stanley 's enthusiastic biography he is the religiously inspired pedagog . And in Strachey 's flashing satiric sketch he is the stodgy pedant , a typical Victorian . Strachey thereby incurs the wrath of Arnold 's great-grandson and present biographer , who adds nothing further to the portrait , but demonstrates , in a thoughtful , conscientious manner , Arnold 's changes in school curriculum as the beginning of educational reform .
