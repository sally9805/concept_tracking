The battle of Einstein is raging on all fronts more fiercely than ever . Scarcely had Dr. William Wallace Campbell , director of the Lick Observatory , announced that photographs taken by the Crocker expedition at Wallal , on the northwest coast of Australia , during the solar eclipse of last September , confirmed the predictions of Einstein 's theory of relativity as to the bending of star rays out of their normal paths by the sun 's influence , when Captain Thomas Jefferson Jackson See , U. S. N. , astronomer at the Mare Island Navy Yard , issued a statement regretting Dr. Campbell 's action and denouncing Dr. Einstein as an impostor and plagiarist . <P> Captain See is no slouch of a mathematical astronomer in his own right . A graduate of American universities and a Ph.D . of Berlin , a member of all the great astronomical societies of the world , a research worker of established reputation in the very fields in which Einstein has gained his fame , he is " starred " in Cattell 's American Men of Science , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the 50 leading astronomers in America whose work is supposed to be most important , by vote of their own colleagues . And so is Dr. Campbell , for that matter . <P> Dr. See 's indictment charges : <P> 1 ) That the fundamental postulates of Einstein that ether does not exist and that gravity is not a force , but a property of space , are crazy vagaries , disgraceful in a scientific age , and repudiated by the Paris Academy of Sciences and by reputable German scholars . <P> 2 ) That the English physicist , Henry Cavendish ( 1731-1810 ) , and the German mathematician , Johann von Soldner , especially the latter , anticipated Einstein by 120 years in calculating the effect of gravitation on light rays and in deriving the formulas on which his work is based . Einstein never mentions von Soldner in his writings , and he even copies an error which von Soldner made in his formula , and which was exposed in recent years . <P> " Einstein can not be regarded as a scientist of real note , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigator . " <P> So far , however , the weight of evidence , as well as the opinion of the majority of intellectuals , seems to be in favor of Einstein . The Lick photographs , partly confirmed by those taken at the same place by . <P> University of Toronto astronomers , give results for the bending of a stellar ray just grazing the sun 's edge , within one-hundredth of a second of arc of Einstein 's prediction that they would be deflected 1.75 seconds . <P> From the Bureau of Standards simultaneously comes evidence of a different nature . The demonstration involved the weighing of topaz and diamond crystals in certain positions in relation to the axis of the earth . The experiments were in charge of Dr. Paul R. Heyl . Under the Newtonian theory of gravitation , the crystals would vary in weight in certain positions . This Einstein denied , and Dr. Heyl has so far found no variation , though using scales so delicate that they can detect differences of one part in a billion .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
