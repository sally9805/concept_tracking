txt Letters to the Editor From The Times Readers on Topics in the News COMPARING FARM-AID PLANS OF TWO PARTY PLATFORMS Democrats Line Up With Farmers and'PeOple While the Republicans Favor Speculators , Mr. Peek Asserts As a nation we have a moral responsibility for the agricultural situation which we can not escape . The working out of deliberate national policies has brought farming to its present crisis . The question is no longer : Shall we do something ? It is : What shall we do ? The veto of President Coolidge of the two farm bills passed by Congress in its last two sessions , without any constructive alternative for agriculture , left the farmers in the normally Republican States in a bitter state of mind particularly as it Was followed by the action of the party in its convention at Kansas City , and by the failure of its standard bearer , Mr. Hoover , in his speech of acceptance and in his West Branch speech , to hold out to farmers any hope of securing effective protection in the home market from the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto message exposes clearly the real grounds for the Coolidge objections to the bill . For months it had been stated on his behalf that his real objection was to the equalization fee provisions of the measure . His second message reveals that such is not the case . Talk about the equalization fee is only camouflage . The veto serves notice upon the farmers that they will be permitted to secure no benefit from protective tariffs on the surplus crops if those in control of the machinery of the Republican Party can help it . The fundamental objection which Underlies this entire message stands equally against any device intended to make protective tariffs effective on our major crops . It would apply against agricultural tariffs them  --  elves if in any way they were to be made really effective to raise the farm prices of foodstuffs and raw material . The very crux of the Coolidge objection is stated in the opening sentence of the second paragraph of the veto me ; age , which says : " In its essentials the objectionable plan proposed here is the stimulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificially controlling the surpluses so that there will be an apparent scarcity on the market . " Here is the heart of the whole matter . President Coolidge objected to surplus control if the object of such control is the " stimulation of prices of agricultural crops and products thereof . " Therefore , he objects to the result even if cooperative associations acting Mr themselves without Government assistance could accomplish it . In Kansas City the Administration forces were in control and the Administration views on agriculture prevailed . There was no objection on the part of the party leaders to the old 1924 pledge that the party would restore equality to agriculture with other industry , so it was repeated . There is nothing in the platform that even remotely recognizes the fundamental problem a agricultural surpluses . The farm board and stabilization corporations are suggested  --  in other words , the Crisp bill or the Fess bill , whose futility has repeatedly been recognized by Congress . The Farmers ' Alternative . The refusal even to recognize the problem of making the tariff of some Value to producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home market , is Most significant of all . The only course recognized for farmers is to produce at world prices or else get out of business . The President 's messages say so , his spokesmen at Kanteas City said so , and the platform in effect confirms them . In his acceptance speech , Mr. Hoover had much to say about the necessilty for immediate action to restore prosperity and contentment to the American farmer , notwithstanding the fact that he has been in position for the last eight years to institute policies for that purpose , during the time he has earned for himself the name of foremost obstructionist . He promises to use his office and influence to give the American farmers " the benefit of our historic tariff policy . " There is a delicious bit of unconscious humor in this remark since the " historic tariff policy " of the Republican Party is exactly what the farmers are complaining about . Mr. Hoover dangled before the eyes of the Republicans of Brookhart 's type the implied suggestion of Treasury subsidy of several hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " stabilization corporations "  --  a method of farm relief which farm organisations and Congress had repeatedly examined and rejected . For weeks before Mr. Hoover 's address at West Branch , on Aug. 21 , Mr. Hoover 's friends had been passing the word around , " Just wait until his West Branch speech , he will outline a real agricultural program then . " The West Branch speech must have been a sickening disappointment to such hopeful followers . Mr. Hoover then took occasion to make the fact perfectly clear that he did not favor Government aid beyond loans . Farmers are united in their declaration that they are not looking for any new ways to get in debt , but for prices that will help them pay off the twelve to fourteen billions of old indebtedness that bears down upon them . His West Branch speech contains nothing hopeful for agriculture and , like his acceptance speech , definitely rejected the farmers ' plea for a method by which the tariff can be made operative for agriculture . The Democratic Position . The Democratic Party at Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agricultural legislation which a large majority of Democrats in both houses of Congress had supported . On the last vote which passed surplus control legislation , 71 per cent . of the Democrats fn the Senate and 61 per cent . of the Democrats in the House supported Its measure . The position on farm relief taken in the Democratic platform can not be honsstly misconstrued . The right of farm organizations to lead in the development of a national farm policy is recognized in these words : " Hostility to advocates of farm relief and denial of the right of farm Organizations to lead in the development of farm policy must yield to Democratic sympathy and friendliness . " In its economic discussion , the platform recognizes thee farmers in the mass can not adjust their production to an amount that just fills the estimated demend , because ( 1 ) six million individuals can not cooperate as closely and as effectively as a few corporations can , and ( 2 ) weather , pests and other uncontrollable factors count for more than acreage does in determining what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem squarely when A said : " Producers of crops whose total volume exceeds the needs of the domestic market must continue at a disadvantage until the Government E hall intervene as seriously and as effectively in their behalf of the firmer as it has intervened in behalf of labor and industry . " Platform Pledges . The platform promises " the united efforts of both legislative and executive branches of government to immediate enactment " of legislation to prevent the price of the surplus from determining the price of the whole crop . It then pledges " such other steps as are necessary to restore and maintam the purchasing power of agriculture and not the complete economic equality of agrieulture . " The justice and the soundness of the principle by which the bill sought to have each each commodity bear the cost of its own , protection and stabilization are clearly recognized in language which describes and recognizes the proper place of the principle of the equaliza- tion fee . The principle of the fee never has been the end of the surf plus control legislation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought , which is the handling of surpluses so that prices may be stabilized at fair levels without governmental subl. sidy , and so that farmers may get some benefit from the tariff on crops whose total supply exceeds domestic needs . The pledges just quoted describe accurately what farmers have been seeking in the way of national leg 's , lation . In his telegram to W. H. Settle , President of the Indiana Farm Bureau Federation , his speech of acceptance and his Omaha speech , Gov. ' . governor Smith has taken his stand squarely on the agricultural plank of the Houston platform . He said at Omaha : " As I read the bill , its fundamental purpose Is to establish an effective control of the sale of exportable surplus with the cost imposed upon the commodity benefited . For that principle the Democratic platform squarely stands and for that principle I squarely stand . " Amplifying his position later , he-declared : ' lin order to give the farmer the benefit of the tariff there must be some way to lift the exportable surplus off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are several ways by which this principle cpn be made effective . Governor Smith does not limit himself at this time to any one specific piece of machinery . Neither does he commit himself against any specific method . In this he is both wise and statesmanlike . He wishes to choose from among all the principle methods of proceeding the one best suited to the purpose . Thus , the issue is defined . The Republican Party and its candidate reject the program advanced by agricultural organizations and align themselves with speculators , dealers in farm commodities and the big concerns that are anxious to monopolize American export trade . The Democratic Party and its candidate stand for and align themselves with the farmers , the farm cooperative associations and farm organizations and the rank and file of the people throughout the country . GEORGE N. PEEK . Chicago , Ill. , Oct. 1 , 1928 . RELIGION AND CITIZENSHIP Freedom of Conscience in Church Matters Is Held to Be Vital in a Real Democracy To the Edam of Tile New York MUGS : The injection of religion into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most earnestly to be deprecated . Religion is apart from politics and its freedom solemnly guaranteed . The form in which worship is offered to the Creator is distinctively according to the dictates of the individual conscience , and so long as the members of the different denominations follow their convictions , discrimination against any of them is subversive of our fundamental law . Religion is the effective teacher of morality , and without morality there is no good citizenship . To profess Catholicism is not per se a claim to all the virtues . There are Catholics in name who are not observant , as there are those in all denominations , but the Catholic who lives up to the teachings of that Church must be a good citizen . No specific charge is or can be made to the contrary . Moreover , it may be said that the faith which holde Catholics to their Church is of a nature which precludes any change without injury to citizenship , for nothing else supplies its place . This is especially true of the great body of Catholics who believe yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave moral derelicts . An Uncharitable Attitude . While the atheist may rail against religion , to be consistent his objection must be to all religienebut for one believer to rail against another over a difference in the form of worship is to deny the cornerstone of his own belief , which teaches charity as an integral part of worship . In other words , there can be no form of religion not entitled to the tolerance and respect of all other forms , the objective being the same in all cases . We have in this campaign the spectacle of an important Federal official appealing to ha fellow religionists to oppose the candidacy of Governor Smith in a body . On the other hand we have heard Governor Smith declare that he asks for no Catholic vote unless it is backed by belief in his fitness . A number of Protestants of different denominations and a number of Jews have denounced the " whispering campaign , " though it has gone far ' beyond the whispering stage , pointing out how destructive it is to our institutions and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it that is feared from a Catholic President in a man who has given such undisputed proof of his liberal views in the matter of religion ? If we suppose the impossible  --  that the Church would try to sway him in his official capacity or In aught apart from hi spiritual obligations  --  does any intelligent citizen believe that he or any other enlightened Catholic would swerve from the duty he owes to the State ? As a Catholic I know that the Church has never interfered with my duty as a citizen except to emphasize my obligations as such , and when asked to give advice to the graduates of child-caring institutions in which I am interested I am encouraged to dwell upon this point . Freedom of Conscience Vital . One of the proudest boasts a this country , the exponent of real democracy , is that the highest station is available to those of humblest origin , given integrity and aptitude . These qualities in Governor Smith , during his career as chief magistrate of this State , are certified by his every act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political aca ! Versarles as well . The hope of the future lies in the ambition of youth , Catholic as well as Protestant and Jew . If the fiat goes forth that whatever proof they give of ability , whatever claim they establish to the confidence of the community , the higher stations are to be hoped for only at a sacrifice of conscience , it is not difficult to foretell the future . The Republican candidate disclaims responsibility for an appeal ' to intolerance which reflects on the character of the electorate , yet he is willing to profit by it , unwilling to publicly disavow or rebuke it . G. L. DUVAL . New York , Oct . I , 1928 . A PRESIDENT FOR ALL To the Editor of The New York TalICS : The benefits resulting from the economic policies of the Government depend on one 's setting in life . The speed of the truck horse along the highway is determined by the size of the load . So is the progress of an individual affected by the weight he has to carry , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equal right does not imply equal opportunity . In a democracy the majority is invested with the power to rule , but , in fact , the entire Federal machinery Is dominated by fewer than 1 per cent . of the party in power . The vast sums required for nominations and elections are contributed mainly by this small fraction , each having his own axe to grind . At the great national banquet that this oligarchy provides there is some solid food for perhaps 5 per cent , more ; and , below these , another 10 per cent . that are content with the crumbs ; the remaining part of the dominant party serve only as props on election day , receiving no tangible benefits whatever , and they are exploited along with the masses on the losing side . Between the capitalistic control on the one eland and organized ' labor on the other , the " White-CollarMan " is being ground up in the machinery . The members of labor organizations can protect themselves every day in the year , but the wageearner that is unaffiliated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be pushed Into economic slavery . But ! when election day comes ' he finds himself in a maze of contradictory influences , the chief being that times may become worse before a new Administiation can make them better . He is afraid that the Federal Reserve Banks may not be the bulwarks that their creator intended . This is the club by which he is whipped into line . The coercion is subtle but effective . The Republican managers know the full value of surface indications on the listless voter , and exploit the idea to the utmost ; the scramble for the band wagon is like a gold rush . Their spellbinders know . that the compelling points of political argument get lost in lengthy ' talk , and refrain accordingly . The voter is reminded that in 1914 , when the Democrats were in power , " hard time , s " prevailed throughout the country ; but he is not told that this condition was deliberately brought ' by curtailing credit and postponing purchases and improvements , , thus bringing business to a standstill . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to the manipulation of the money rate , and reads occasionally of the enhancement of values , but he as ? not told that he , as a consumer , is expected to help pay at least 6 per cent . on the increment . " Prosperity " is constantly pushed on his notice by reports of increased savings in the banks , but nothing ' is said , about the decreased buying power of the dollar ; thi5 ' is blamed on the war , when it is nothing but the income tax being passed along to the consumer , on whom it is made to fall as gently as Summer rain . Nothing is said about the constantly increasing centralization of industry , nor of the exhaustion of the unreplaceable natural resources of coal , oil , lumber , iron , &c.,; for the export trade ; the next generations can look out for themselves , perhaps ( ! by importing these commodities at higher prices . The voter is frequent13 ' , reminded that the tariff is purely a fRepublican measure and is the father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak tree at the village baseball field that shelters telly a few from the shower  --  the many get soaked . How delighted would be the tariff-protected employe to " draw down " the pay of the unprotected carpenter or stone mason , and kindred trades . The voter is told that if it- were not for the tariff there would be no work for the skilled mechanic , and he is overwhelmed by the endless ramifications necessary to combat this notion . The American capacity for adaptation is not to be considered ; those engaged in the radio and aircraft lines are supposed to have starved were it not for these innovations . ' He is reminded of the saloon and the brass rail . What enforcement of the Volstead act can be expected from  --  a party which , after eight years a power , leaves it difficult for a stranger , in search of a bite of lunch , to keep out of a speak-easy ?

The farmer has ever been at the mercy ' of the grain speculator and the railroad traffic managers . He must go to work at 5 o'clock and his remuneration is determined by the man who gets up at 9 . He surely needs d " friend in court " with an understanding sympathy . Religious influence in the present campaign will , in the end , prove negligible ; closed minds have never been allied with the Democratic Party , and every intelligent person knows that one 's real religion shines through character and conduct . A campaign of enlightenment is going on , with every promise of sustained force , and on election day the " White-Collar-Man " may realize his own potential power and wake up to the idea that a change of control might produce a wider distribution of the " prosperity " that he reads about in the partisan press .

LONG WINTER INDICATED BY ACTION OF BEAVERS To the Editor of The New York Times : From the actions a the beavers in building new houses , repairing and raising their dams , collecting food for their Winter supply from the bark of the trees they cut down , in August and September , which are , very early dates , they undoubtedly expect ' a long Winter .

REWARD AND GENIUS Florence Brooke-Aten Favors National Anthem Prize . To the Editor of The New York 2'imes : Some time ago I offered prizes , amounting in the aggregate to $6,000 , to the winners of a competition open to ' all American citizens for a national anthem . The matter has been in my mind for some years , but what converted my thoughts into definite action was the absurd and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution and the War of 1812 and who had a son in the World War , the pathetic spectacle of Americans in public resorts in Europe attempting to sMg ' ' The Star - Spangled Banner " without knowing the words and without being able to sing all the notes . ? I am as well acquainted as most people with the noble and stirring event which inspired Francis Scott Key to write the words a " The StarSpangled Banner , " nor am I prepared to yield place to any one in respect of the deep feeling which these words have always created in me . There are , however , reasons which seem to me to make that poem unsuitable for use as a national anthem , particularly in its present setting . A Lack a Continuity . In the first place , the nature of the poem is such that after its use of over a century the people of this nation are unable to sing correctly the words of even the first verse . That this M due to the inherent lack of continuity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses of " My Country , ' TM of Thee , " are known almost universally throughout the nation . Secondly , none but a trained voice of a certain type can effectively sing the notes . It would seem obvious that this reason alone should disqualify . any composition Mr a national anthem . Shortly after my prize offer was published Commander John Philip Sousa wrote an article in THE Times Magazine , entitled " What Our National Anthem Should Be . " Although ! I have read this article several times I have found in it only one stptement which tends in any degree to cast a doubt upon the practicability of the plan I have suggestedtin offering the prizes . I am at one with Commander Sousa when he says that after 150 years of national existence we are without a suitable anthem ; when he says that the niusic of " The Star-Spangled Banner " is that of an old English drinking song in which " Anacreon in Heavep " sends a message to earth making the promise And " ' Aides I 'll Instruct you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacchus 's vine . Nor Uin I at odds with him when he says that the music of " The StarSpangled Banner " is written in an almost impossible register for most voices , nor when he declares that if we examine other patriotic American airs we find plain objections to each one . His article closes as follows : " In an age so rich as ours , in a nation so blessed with spirit and imagination , I think we may be certain that our national anthem will be a noble work . " Prize Plan Disapproved . The sentence which troubles me , since it sweeps my whole plan into Commander Sousa 's waste-basket as Utterly impractical , runs thus : " America will never get a national anthem by offering prizes for one . " This puts me in the distressful position of attempting to sterilize the American spirit and the American imagination by offering them a prize . It is really doing something less than justice to my common sense to suggest that in offering the prizes I expect to create a poet or a musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets and musicians 0 genius or high talent , not necessarily mspired by the monetary value of prizes but by having their attention directed t o the need of a national anthem , may produce ' in some period of emotional exaltation a composition which because of As merit will be spontaneously adopted by the people of this nation as their national anthem . Emotional exaltation is produced under extremely varied conditions , and Commander Sousa 's position and experience give weight to any guess he may make as to exactly what chain of events or circumstances will produce it , but at most it is only a guess . The broad contention made by any one that genius can not be stimulated to activity by the prospect of reward runs counter to the whole record of the arts and sciences . What did not the Medici give the woild through their patronage of genius ? How many national anthems are superior to that of Austria , which was set to music by Haydn , at the older of Saurau , the Imperial Chancellor ? Was Sargent less a genius because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conrad because he received a Civil List pension from the British Government , or Handel when he was engaged to write the " Messiah , " or Rodin when Joseph Pulitzer paid him to make a bust ? Reward , Encourages Genius . No , you can not create genius by offering money , but by offering money you can often make genius create . I am not sufficiently optimistic to think the chance of having a really great national anthem result from this competition is anything but small ; neither am I in the least inclined to do anything more than reward the victors , in case the best efforts of the competition fall short of the high standards necessary for a national anthem . Neverthless , it is my wish to promote this competition , in the hope that it may produce the desired results . As to the insistence that you can not force a national anthem on the American people , I can only say that no reasonable person could entertain the idea . What one may do , however , is to submit to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially as an expression of a genius native to the soil and as reflecting American sentiment not as addressed to an isolated incident in the nation 's infancy but to a mature people who envisage the community of mankind . FLORENCE BROOKS-ATEN . New York , Oct. 1 , 1928 . MODIFICATION OR REPEAL Congress Could Enact Less Drastic Dry Law Without Nullifying Amendment To the Editor of frlic New York Times : There appears to be considerable misunderstanding about the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution and the enforcement thereof . It has been said that only by the repeal of the amendment can any modification be had . This is erroneous . The Eighteenth Amendment seeking to control the personal habits or diet of the people is essentially repugnant to the basic guarantees of the fundamental law and is a measure inherently fmeign to the purposes of the Constitution . In reality it prohibits nothing without an act of the Congress defining intoxicating beverages &c.; To change the statute law is the right of the representatives of the people and to advocate such a change Is the right of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general good of the nation , or even if the several States should enact local legislation to meet the conditions created by prohibition there would be no nullification of the Constitution , and the courts would sustain such legislation designed to meet the public convenience and welfare . The legal precedents for such constitutional action are numerous , and the expressions of our highest court are worthy of attention . Reason In Emergency . The Court a Appeals of the State of New York in People &c.; vs . Laretra ( 230 N. Y. 434-439 affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States , 258 U. S. 242 ) in deciding the constitutionality of certain social laws designed " to meet conditions which seriously affected and endangered the public welfare , health and morals in certain cities of the State " said : " Although emergency can not become the source of power , and although the Constitution can not be suspended in any complication of peace or war ( ex parte Milligan , 4 Wall . 2 ) an emergency may afford a reason for putting forth a latent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This refers to the latent police power of the State which may be exercised in the discretion of the legislature . The Court also said : " Novelty is no argument against constitutionality . Changing economic conditions , temporary or permanent , may make necessary or beneficial the right of public regulation . " ( p , 446 . ) " The question comes back to what the State may do for the benefit of the community at large . Here the legislation rests on a secure foundation . ( Chicago &; Alton R. R. Co. vs . Tranbarger , 238 U. S. 67 , 76 , 77 ) . The struggle to meet changing conditions through new legislation constantly goes on . The fundamental question is whether society is prepared for the change . The law of each age is ultimately what that age thinks should be the law . " ( p. 450 . ) " Curative action is needed .

" ( p. 451 . ) The State and Prohibition . On November 2 , 1926 , the people of the State of New York , recognizing the vast evils of Federal prohibition , overwhelmingly demanded a change in the prohibition laws so as to allow the State to determine this question for itself . This was a nonpartisan mandate which both parties should respect . Aside from the elimination of the demoralization due to present prohibition any modification in the law would benefit the economic situation in that huge and oppressive taxes would be greatly reduced . Not only have a great majority of the people of this State adopted a lawful expression of opinion condemning prohibition but the highest court of the land , and the highest court of this State , have expressly approved of legislation designed to avoid a public inconvenience and to promote the public welfare although constitutional inhibitions were involved . J. R. D. New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE LAWS To the Editot of The : Veto Yoik Tiniest Any statute is one or the other of two kinds . Either it accords so well with the people 's will that it can be enforced or it accords so little with that will that it can not be enforced . In the former case the statute is a law . In the latter case the statute is not a genuine law ; it is only a pseudo . law , a legislative fiasco . Enforceability Is of the very essence of a genuine law , because enforceability depends essentially upon the will of the people , and because , in our theory of government , the people 's will is , in last anaylsis , the lawmaker . A statute that is approved of by a large majority of the people is enforceable and is , therefore , a genuine law . Whenever a pseudo-law is enacted it is the result of the efforts of a minority or of a small majority to impose its own will by legislation upon the whole people . A vast country like ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the people of South Carolina or Rhode Island , for example , may be tempted to try to impose their will upon the people of New York or California , or vice versa , presents a most extraordinary opportunity and temptation for the practice of pseudo-legislation . On this account our political philosophers and statesmen are confronted with a very great and very pressing problem , which concerns the liberties of all of our citizens without exception . I mean the problem of undoing the mischief that has been wrought by existing pseudo-laws and of preventing the enactment of such laws in the future . Solution of that problem is demanded by nothing less than the fundamental principles of democratic government , for the supreme concern of those principles is the protection and the advancement of individual freedom , and they are grossly violated whenever a vast number of men and women , whether a majority or a large minority of the people , are subjected to the rule of pseudo-laws which they not only do not approve of , but which they abominate as odious . Tyranny is tyranny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority or a small majority of an immense population . The great political problem which I have signalized was not created by the pseudo-laws now currently designated as prohibition . But these pseudo-laws have caused many thousands of thoughtful mon and women to realize more keenly than ever before that the problem exists and that a solution of it must be found if we are to end the tyranny now exercised in the name a democratic government . For every one knows that those citizens who bitterly resent existing prohibition as an atrocious invasion of their personal liberty are sufficiently numerous to constitute of themselves a great nation . That problem , which involves the most fundamental and momentous issue of the present national campaign , Mr. Hoover has not so much as recognized , much less has he proposed a solution for it or even intimated that he has sought or is seeking a solution .

CENTENARY OBSERVANCE URGED FOR THEODORE LOW DE VINNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Achieved World-Wide Fame To the Editor of The New Yotk Times : In a book privately printed in 1915 in commemoration of the death of Theodore Low DeVinne ha 1914 the following quotation appeared on the reverse of the bastard title-page . " I shall not live to see it , but I hope that the time will come when the making a a good book , from the mechanical point of view , will be regarded as an achievement quite as worthy as the painting of a good picture . "  - -  Theodore Low DeVinne . Had another decade been added to the four-score and six years of the life of this eminent American printer he would have seen his wish come true . For there are those among us today who believe that the art of bookmaking has reached the point where certain books hold equal rank with the paintings of our foremost artists . Born on Christmas Day . The centenary of the birth of Theodore Low DeVinne will occur on Christmas Day of the present year . He was born in Stamford , Conn. , Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in Londonderry . Ireland , in 1793 , came to this country M his infancy and until his eleventh year resided in Charleston , Montgomery County , New York . A schoolmaster in Brooklyn in 1812 , he was ordained to the ministry in 1848 . The father was a man well versed in Greek and Latin , the latter of which he taught to his sons , of whom he had six . Four of these sons became printers , while two chose bookbinding for their vocations Of these six sons , Theodore was the one outstanding printer which this country produced since the days of Benjamin Franklin . Beginning his career in the office of The Newburgh Gazette in 1842 , he came to New York in 1848 , where he was employed in various printing houses , newspaper plants and in a stereotype foundry until 1850 , when he entered the establishment of Francis Hart . His younger brother , Daniel S. DeVinne , was also employed by Hart , and for nearly fifty years the two brothers were closely associated . When the firm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Theodore Brockbank DeVinne , his son , was made a member of the firm . At the time of Theodore Low DeVinne 's connection with the firm of Francis Hart , printing in this country was in a deplorable state . But with DeVinne 's advent the quality of the work showed consistent progress . Even today Scribner 's Monthly , which he printed , might be considered a creditable piece of printing . His work in connection with printing The Century was an effort of marked achievement , particularly in the manipulation of wood engravings , a which he was a decided master . He electrified the printing world by his handling of the halftone , which , much to his regret , supplanted the woodcut . In the use of coated paper he was a pioneer , and much of It was made to suit his own special requirements . A Leader in the Industry . Theodore Low DeVinne 's intimate associations with the members of The Century staff , coupled with his Insatiable thirst for learning , made a cultured man of him . In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the printing industry and to make the craft respected by the public in general . The literature of printing has been greatly enriched by his numerous contributions . His foremost work was " The Invention of Printing , " considered by many to be the most authoritative work on the subject in the English language . His knowledge of Latin , acquired in his youth , and of Greek , French and German , was of great assistance to him in aiding his patrons in their difficulties .
