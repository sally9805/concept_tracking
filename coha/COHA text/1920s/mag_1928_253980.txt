Visitors in the U. S. last week included : <P> " Tay Pay . " Sailing toward the U. S. last week , aboard the Cunarder Berengaria , was the famed " Father of the House of Commons , " Thomas Power ( " Tay Pay " ) O'Connor , aged 80 , and still the most vigorously picturesque **26;6673;TOOLONG in England . <P> " Tay Pay " clings to the taking of snuff and to wearing his hat when seated in the House of Commons , where he has sat since 1880 . The snuff is a whim , but the hat stamps him as the last survivor of those indomitable oppositionists , the Irish Nationalists , once led by the late famed Charles Stewart Parnell . <P> Lord Birkenhead has said of " Tay Pay " that if he had been willing to swerve from his quixotic Irish Nationalism " he could have occupied some of the highest offices of State . " Instead he has remained " Tay Pay , " a man who , as the friends and causes of his youth have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he serves peculiar to himself . <P> As a journalist , pamphleteer and essayist his output has ever been prodigious , and he still retains the nominal editorship of T.P. 's and Cassel 's Weekly . <P> Last week he described himself as intent upon " a short visit to America taken purely for my health , " and diplomatically declared : " America is marching in front today in literature . There is no denying her that position . It is all very well to talk against it and rave against it . . . . " <P> Turning to politics , he added : " We should rid ourselves of the camouflage of diplomats . Camouflage was conceived in deceit and born in dishonor . It lies both by inference and directly .

A short time before the exile of Leon ( Lev ) Trotsky ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " <P> Asked about the grain shortage in Russia ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) , he replied : " I can not understand why there should be breadlines and unemployment in a nation so rich as America . . . . Nowhere in Russia , regardless of whether the nation is prospering or not , will you find men without coats , standing in breadlines , waiting for a handout . . . . That is one thing which the Soviet has accomplished which is not a theory but a fact . . . . " <P> Leeds-Anastasia . Rich Mrs. William B. Leeds of Manhattan , ne Princess Xenia of Russia , and thus a second cousin once removed of Tsar Nicholas II , arrived at Manhattan , last week , from a Caribbean cruise . To prying reporters she confirmed the fact that she has now undertaken the protection of that young woman who recently landed at Manhattan , calling herself the Grand Duchess Anastasia , youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) . Discreet , Mrs. Leeds did not reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , who she appears to believe is her third cousin .
