Criticized for bad synchronization in recent films , producers denied their technical incompetence by confessing that " doubles " had sung and talked for certain performers : for Richard Barthelmess ( Weary River ) , one Frank Withers ; for Louise Brooks ( The Canary Murder Case ) , one Margaret Livingston . In Beverly Hills Mabel Normand , sick with tuberculosis , was not told , for fear that she would worry , that her husband , Lew Cody , was also ill . In a San Bernardino health resort Cody , in bed with a nervous breakdown following influenza , was kept ignorant , for a similar reason , that there was anything the matter with his wife .
