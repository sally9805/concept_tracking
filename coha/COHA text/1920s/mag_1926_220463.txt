Canton , seat of Stark County , Ohio , had quieted down for the night . The late President McKinley and his wife slept the long sleep in their granite mausoleum on Monument Hill , with the distant flare of an all-night blast furnace occasionally spreading a ruddy glow over the bronze statue of McKinley , standing tall and pensive above the coffins . Every night the bronze McKinley stands there brooding over Canton , which is as ill-favored as growing industrial towns seem fated to be . At night , however , outward ugliness vanishes and the pensive statue seems to express sorrow over the internal , unseen uglinesses of human society . . . the ugly crazy twist in the mind of McKinley 's assassin , Leon Czolgosz . . . the ugly , crazy twists in the minds of gunmen from many a Midland city , for whom Canton has long been a safe rat-nest between shootings . . . the stunted , poisoned twists in the minds of Canton politicians who sell these gunmen protection . . . . <P> Canton had quieted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means , all asleep . Some worked on night shifts in the factories along foul Nimisillen Creek , making hardware , engines , safes , varnish , cutlery , paving bricks , structural steel . Some of them drained another , and then another and another glass in Canton 's plentiful blind-pigs . People in bawdy-houses are seldom all asleep by 12:30 , and last January 108 such houses flourished in Canton 's three tougher sections , " The Badlands , " " The Hole , " and " Whiskey Centre . " Gunmen and lords of the underworld are not asleep just after midnight . Instead that hour is the dawn of their working day . Many of these sat muttering guardedly in Canton . <P> But Canton was quiet . The town 's respectable dance place , the " Molly Stark , " was ready to close , and out in a genteel residential section , Publisher Donald R. Mellett of the Canton Daily News stopped his automobile in front of his house , to unload Mrs. Mellett and their friends , the Walter Vails , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting along to bed . Mrs. Mellett led the Vails inside and made for the icebox . Publisher Mellett drove his car around to the garage . <P> A bullet , one of many that suddenly spat out from behind the Mellett house , crashed through the kitchen window , narrowly missing Mrs. Mellett 's shingled head . Publisher Mellett 's children , three girls and a boy , awoke and lay trembling in their beds upstairs . What had happened ? <P> Their mother and the Vails found out as soon as they reached the garage . . . . Evidently an assassin , lurking behind the shelter of a rose bush , loosed deadly fire just as Mellett was shutting the doors . One of the slugs had gone in behind his ear , causing instant death . <P> But Publisher Donald R. Mellett , crumpled and bleeding in his backyard , was not uselessly dead . Shooting him , the Canton underworld had shot away a flimsy facade that has been propped for years between Canton 's law-abiding citizenry and a system of back-alley politics and vice-protection fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
