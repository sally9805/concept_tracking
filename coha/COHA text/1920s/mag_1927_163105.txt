Socially well-posted U. S. Negroes know that at Rome resides the most ancient and patrician aristocracy in Europe . Prince Massimo of Rome is an undisputed descendant of the Roman General Quintus Fabius Maximus , " The Delayer " ( Third Century B. C. ) . The family of the late Prince Scipione Borghesi is both Royal and Papal . There are , in fact , dozens , scores , hundreds of Italian noblemen whole titles are genuine and venerable beyond reproach . Therefore , it was not surprising that in Paris last week , famed Negress Black Bottom , and Charleston performer Miss Josephine Baker , once of Harlem , now mistress of a Montmartre night club , should have announced her marriage to Count Pepito di Albertini of Rome . Few of Miss Baker 's race would have kept the secret as long as she said she had kept it-20 days-and when the announcement was cabled to the U. S. last week , Negro newspapers carnivaled . <P> Proud , the Pittsburgh ( Negro ) Courier , boasted : " The Courier was the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . who has just passed from the state of girlhood to womanhood . . . . <P> " Josephine Baker . . . born in St. Louis . . . arose from the obscurity of a Missouri town to be acclaimed the ' Darling of Paris . ' Several years ago . . . when she was a mere girl . . . the Courier . . . remarked that she would go far . " <P> Meanwhile , in Paris , correspondents were asking : " Who is Count Pepito di Albertini ? " Since the Parisian police keep a very careful record of all strangers , it was to M. le Prfet Jean Chiappe that reporters turned . They received a reply which was suavity itself : " Our records show that this gentleman came with Miss Baker from America , three years ago , as her manager . Their addresses in Paris have always been the same , although this residence has changed several times . The gentleman has never claimed a title other than ' Monsieur ' . " <P> Josephine Baker , interviewed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a count . I looked him up in Rome . He 's got a great big family there with lots of coats of arms and everything . His father writes me the nicest letters , and his mother is right here in Paris stopping with us for a while . " <P> Soon the New York Herald Tribune Paris Bureau announced : " The American Consul 's records prove that Count Pepito made her his bride at the consulate . " <P> Meanwhile Negro friends of Miss Baker in Harlem , New York City , positively asserted that she was the wife of a Pullman porter named George Baker . By this time the confusion and sensation were international . The Associated Press put its Rome correspondents to work tracing Count Pepito di Albertini . For three days they ransacked Italian genealogical and police records-found no such name-announced the fact . <P> At last Josephine Baker was cornered , in her Montmartre night club , by reporters who demanded detailed explanations . Miss Baker , clad in an Afric dance costume of bright feathers , shrugged nervously , grinned , confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all something I told my friends for a joke-and see how everybody has taken it seriously . The wedding I spoke of was only just a movie wedding . "
