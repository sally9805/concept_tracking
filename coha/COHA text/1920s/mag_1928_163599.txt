Literal minded Britons were scandalized , last week , at what they took to be an affront offered by George Bernard Shaw to his good &; faithful wife , the onetime Charlotte Frances Payne-Townshend . <P> Another woman , Dame Clara Butt , 55 , onetime famed contralto , had written Pen Man Shaw , asking him to do a preface for her forthcoming biography . Replied he : ' ' Good gracious ! I 'd never dare ! You 're a much bigger person than I. I should look like a ridiculous little busybody making a pretentious bow in your limelight . And , anyhow , what could I say of Clara Butt ? <P> " I witnessed her debut as Orfeo . Loved her . Would have married her if she had asked me . She did n't . Might actually have chosen Bernard Shaw and chose a Mr. Rumford instead . What a woman ! <P> " Do n't let anybody touch your book except yourself . If you find any one impertinent enough to venture , burn his foreword and drop him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances Payne-Townshend Shaw may not always have been first in her husband 's affections , she good humoredly ignored his Butt-letter last week . Friends found her more interested in recounting the details of a holiday which the Shaws have just taken at Llangollen , in Wales , where they sojourned in a suite of rooms once occupied by Poet Robert Browning . At present international interest in G. B. S. centers upon his forthcoming book , The Intelligent Woman 's Guide to Socialism which will be published on or about June 1 . <P> Eyes privileged to glimpse the advance proofs , last week , reported that the book is a voluminous answer to a possible hypothetical woman who asked Mr. Shaw to " explain Socialism . " From this point of departure he launches into a potpourri of Shaviana keynoted by such statements as the following : The first principle of Socialism is equal income for all . . . . Every other system for distribution of wealth is unjust and illogical . . . . The Socialist experiment failed in Russia because the people were not prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia . ... <P> Commentators guessed that Socialist Shaw would be the unhappiest of men in the state of society which he envisions . Everyone knows that he haggles and drives the sharpest of bargains whenever he sells a manuscript . He exploits his unique gifts far more avariciously than a Capitalistic Trust exploits any monopoly . At present Pen Man Shaw can and does loll in luxury upon his royalties , enjoying profits of a nature which he delights to describe as " unjust and illogical . "
