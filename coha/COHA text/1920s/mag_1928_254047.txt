Writer Threatened <P> Sirs : <P> My letter relative to Senator Heflin ( TIME , May 7 ) caused quite a commotion . My mail has been flooded with vicious , threatening and insulting letters . I also received a suspicious package that I think was a " pineapple . " I buried that " gentleman " at sea without a ritual . <P> It is a serious thing if TIME and other liberal papers and magazines are not allowed to open their columns to a discussion of any subject without the air being full of " brickbats . " If a fellow is hit , let him express his views or come back in TIME . <P> J. H. O'NEILL , M.D. <P> Morgan City , La . <P> <P> TIME will do all in its power to bring to justice and jail anyone guilty of pineappling , or threatening to pineapple , the author of any letter published on TIME 'S letter page. - ED . <P> <P> Nigger Lovers <P> Sirs : <P> Do n't you think it rather poor taste to air the philanderings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ? <P> Could not this space have been used for a better purpose instead ? We really enjoy reading your magazine each week and would certainly deplore seeing it descend to the depths achieved by Bernarr Macfadden in his pornographic publications . <P> Yours for omissions of such drivel , <P> FRED C. CLURIEL <P> Wheeling , W. Va . <P> <P> The affairs of famed U. S. Negress Josephine Baker were recently made the subject of debate by the parliaments of Austria &; Hungary . TIME has never " aired " any assertion that Negress Baker " philanders , " has never hesitated to chronicle her ebullient antics when they became of general or parliamentary interest. - ED . <P> <P> Son Ritz <P> Sirs : <P> TIME in a recent issue paid a very nice compliment to Cesar Ritz , founder of the Ritz hotel system-not so nice to the son Chas . C. <P> TIME was in error in stating the latter to be one of two surviving children . Charly , a personal friend of the writer 's , is the sole Ritz offspring extant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and highly prosperous importer of French novelties in New York City , married here ; that he returns to France solely because he feels it his duty to his mother , alone in Paris without husband , children . <P> Son Ritz cares nothing for what so-called smart folk term " ritzy ; " prefers hunting , fishing , camping . However , should occasion demand it , can be very magnificent . No one has a better right to the name of Ritz ; no one more qualified to uphold its traditions . Son Ritz as a rule has no mustache . <P> VAN CAMPEN HEILNER <P> Spring Lake Beach , N. J. <P> P. S. Your journal continues to lead the field ; improves issually . <P> <P> Roosevelt 's Courage <P> Sirs : <P> One further remark on the matter of President Roosevelt 's flying .
