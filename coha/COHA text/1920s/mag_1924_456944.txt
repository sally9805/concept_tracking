DINING once with a charming woman , and matching minds , as was our habit , about London , she asked me : If you kept a public house in London , what would you name it ? ' Well , ' I replied , after a moment 's thought , if my " pub " had a good connection , ? meaning thereby , if every old soak in the neighborhood preferred to buy his drink of me rather than of another , ? I should keep the old name , whatever it was . If , on the other hand , I had to name it myself , I should call it the Bunch of Grapes , suggesting thereby expensive wines rather than cheap malt liquor ; then also it would be called by the cockney , the " Bunch of Gripes " ? and that would delight me . What would you call yours ? ' " The Marquis of Granby , " ' she replied promptly ; ' I 've always thought that a very elegant name . You 'd call it " Markis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I replied . What 's your favorite railway-station ? ' Victoria , Brighton Line , ' she said . And yours ? ' Oh , there 's only one for me , ' I answered . ' Euston , the station by which I first entered the great town , one evening in June , just forty years ago . ' We drifted on to other subjects and the matter went out of my mind until the other day when , happening to pass the great granite portals of that station , I thought of the joy that was mine when I first realized that I was actually in London . I was traveling entirely by myself and my chief preparation for my tour had been a course of the Rollo Books ? and I can hardly imagine a better . By them I was in some measure prepared for whatever came my way , whether ' Upon the Atlantic , ' In London , ' or elsewhere . When my boat , the British Prince , a tub that sailed from Philadelphia , touched at Queens . town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand . It was from a young lad , a distant cousin whom I had heard of only remotely ; but it welcomed me to English shores . If I knew what you looked like , ' he said , ' I would meet you at Euston . ' I wondered where Euston was . But as my cousin was not prepared to recognize me , his letter went on to say that perhaps I would take a cab at the station and come along to No. 2 Rupert Street where I could live with hint very cheaply , if I wanted to . When , upon arrival , I stepped out into the almost unspeakable confusion of Ens-ton , I wondered how ever was I to make my way to my destination ; but all difficulties vanished as I approached them , and half an hour later I was being welcomed by a boy about my own age into a chea.p and dingy boarding-house where he was living , and I found I could secure a tiny room ? a mere closet in which I could sleep ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bargain was soon struck . I liked the price , even if I did not care for the accommodation and we sallied forth into the streets . I have , I suppose , been happier since ? but not much . And London always makes the same appeal to me . I enter with a feeling of elation ? supremely happy ; I leave it with a feeling of depression . Some day I shall leave London and never see it again . Well , be it so ; we can die but once . The London of the eighteen-eighties was a much noisier and a far more crowded city than now . The streets were narrower and fewer ; the great thoroughfares of Shaftesbury Avenue and the Charing Cross Road were not cot through ; Kingsway and Aldwych were undreamed of and , above all , there were no tubes ? only one underground railway into which it was worth one 's life to enter , so filled was it with filthy smoke and sulphurous gases , the accumulation of years . The noise of tens of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distant waves breaking upon a rocky shore . The streets were brilliantly lighted with gas lamps and alive with people surging in every direction ; most men wore silk hats and carried canes ; the poorer class looked very poor , indeed , and wore caps ; soldiers gayly dressed , with tiny round caps of about the size of pill hones held on over one ear by a narrow strap , carrying canes about as thick as a lead pencil and two feet long , were everywhere in evidence . ' So this is London , ' I said to myself . We ate something , somewhere ; I have no idea where or what , for my friend had said to me , ' I have half a sovereign , let 's go to the theatre . Florence St. John ( pronounced Sinjin ) is playing in Olivette . She 's a beauty ! I do n't suppose you have ever heard of %tette . ' Do n't you ? ' I cried . ' If Florence St. John can beat Katharine Lewis singing and dancing in Olivetie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , every bit of it , words and music . Let 's go to the theatre by all means . ' We went , and I was forced to admit that never before had I seen such a wonderful performance . Florence St. John was superb ; she danced and sang all the songs I knew so well , and I was in the seventh heaven of delight . I was told that she was a very naughty woman and that that wealth of golden hair was her own ? or was n't ? I forget which . I vowed it made no difference and it hardly seemed possible that anyone so beautiful ? in tights ? could be so very bad . Plainer women had set such rumors afloat out of mere jealousy . If anything could make me happier than I was it would be to meet Florence St. John in the flesh ? there was a good deal of it . Wait till you see Marie Tempest , ' said my friend . We went to bed . In five minutes I was asleep , in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever knew that London was a late riser , I had forgotten it . There was much to be seen . I would get up and see it . It was almost seven o'clock . Dressing quietly , for not a sound was to be heard in the house , I went downstairs and let myself out into the street . Not a soul was in sight . Of the roar of the traffic , which had so impressed me the night before , nothing was to be heard . It seemed very strange that the pulse of London should have ceased beating . I did not know which to see first ? the Tower , or Westminster Abbey . Consulting my map I found the Abbey to be the nearer and I quickly found my way into Trafalgar Square and walked rapidly on through Whitehall , stopping for a moment opposite the Horse Guards . Reaching the Abbey , I tried the door . I might just as well have 300 LONDON IN THE EIGHTEEN ? EIGHTIES tried the door of the Bank of England . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not passed a single person on my walk . I walked by and admired Westminster Hall , the House of Parliament , and crossed over Westminster Bridge . Then I began to feel hungry , very . I tried the doors of several restaurants ? finally one yielded to my hand . I went in ; on the bare wooden tables were stacked equally bare wooden chairs , harpies were on their hands and knees scrubbing with an ecstasy I had never seen before . I asked for coffee and a roll . I might just as well have asked for canvas-back duck and champagne . This occurred at Lockhart 's : these establishments are gone now . If I remember correctly they have been swallowed up by the A.B.C 's . I then decided to return to Rupert Street , trying restaurant doors as I did so , always with one result . Entering the house , ? I had a key , ? I went to my friend 's room and saw him preparing for his ablutions with about a quart of hot water in a small basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . ' My word ! you are early , ' was all he said . ' Go downstairs . I ' 11 join you in a few minutes . You ' 11 find my newspaper at my place in the breakfast-room . I take in the Chronicle . ' I had a very bad cup of tea , an egg that had met with an accident , bread , butter , and something that was called marmalade ? but I was in London and I was very happy . No. 2 Rupert Street is next to the corner of Coventry Street and just across the street , on the opposite corner of what would still be Rupert Street if that street had not tired of its name , was the Prince of Wales 's theatre . At that theatre a young and beautiful girl , as exquisite as a Dresden china shep . herdess , ? her name Marie Tempest , ? was playing in an operette called Dorothy . It has not , I think , been played in the United States ? why , I could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sort of combination of Erminie and Robin Hood . It was lovely ! There was a fine song , ' Be wise in time , 0 Phyllis Mine , ' and another , Queen of My Heart , ' sung by Hayden Coffin , then in his prime , that I thought the finest songs I had ever heard . They might seem rather flat to-day , but at the time , ? it was forty years ago , dear reader , and I was twenty , ? I thought nothing more melodious had ever been written . And there was a hunting song that almost turned me into a sportsman . Night after night I used to climb to the gallery of the Prince of Wales 's , until I knew the words and music so well that I could have taken any part , on short notice . And in after years , whenever and wherever Marie Tempest was playing , I always used to see her and with all the enthusiasm of youth . Some who read these lines may remember how beautiful and graceful she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , years later , she toured the United States . Finally , she gave up comic opera and became a comedy actress of charm and grace , occasionally singing some simple song with such skill as only a cultivated musician can , playing her own accompaniment . Once I saw her as Polly Eccles in Robertson 's old-fashioned , but amusing , play , Caste , and more recently , ? but Marie Tempest is only of yesterday , ? or is it to-morrow , ? and the whole world is at her feet . The last time I saw her , I did what I had always been threatening to do : I told her that I loved her . But many men have told her so , and my declara-tion occasioned her no surprise . It came about in this way : it was during the war and for economy 's sake we had closed our house in the country and were living at the Ritz in Philadelphia . One evening after the play , she came into the supper-room with her husband , Graham Browne , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and I were sitting . On the spur of the moment I got up , and telling my wife that something very pleasant , or very unpleasant , was almost immediately going to happen to me , I went over to where she sat and , holding out my hand after the manner of an old friend , I said , ' Miss Tempest , I can not suppose that you remember me ; but we have met many times in London . ' She gave me her hand with the merest trace of bewilderment , and asked me to sit down . As I did so , I observed that it was in 1884 , when she was playing in Dorothy at the Prince of Wales 's , and that I had never forgotten and never should forget how unspeakably lovely she was . Instantly she became the actress again and , holding my hand to detain me , said , ' Run away , my boy , run away ; there was no such year . ' ' I have left my wife over there , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sing to you , " Be wise in time . " It may be a little late , but ? ' ' It is , it is , ' she cried with a laugh ; ' but do you know my husband ? ' Then followed about the merriest ten minutes ' talk I have ever had , when , telling her that I should love her to my dying day , I returned to the wife of my bosom whom I have always suspected of hoping that I would meet with a rebuff . A few minutes later Graham Browne got up , and coming to my table held out his hand to my wife saying , that as I had been making love to his lady he thought it only fair that he should be allowed the same privilege . So the honors were even , and I am waiting anxiously for our next encounter . Please Heaven it may soon come ! Theatrical reminiscence is rarely interesting : the stage from the front is all motion and light and color ; one would say that an actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality it is not so . It is a life of difficulty , drudgery , and jealousy ; and , when one comes to read of it , one is confronted by a maze of names , real and fictitious , and dates which are useful but not inspiriting . In writing about the success of this actor in that part , or the failure of another in some other part , one finds one 's self indulging in exclamations rather than explanations . Indeed , how is one to suggest , the power of a glance , a gesture , and the voice by a written word ? The actor 's is a fleeting art . Perhaps it is only fair that this should be so , for what other artist enjoys such immediate and tumultuous applause ? The author produces his effect in his study , alone ; the artist paints his picture wondering whether the public will accept it ; the successful actor is instantly rewarded ? and almost as instantly forgotten . Confronting these difficulties I want to speak of Irving and Terry . Charles Lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went on to explain . In like manner , I have no eye . When by chance I remember a face I rarely fasten the proper name to it . But I have ' ear , ' and after a lapse of years I can yet hear , in imagination , Ellen Terry , as Beatrice , say to Henry Irving , as Benedick , ' I wonder that you will still be talking , Signior Benedick . Nobody marks you ' ; and I can still see the lift of his eyebrows as he replies , What , my dear Lady Disdain ! are you yet living ? ' and a moment later , when 302 LONDON IN THE EIGHTEEN ? EIGHTIES she says she would rather hear a dog bark than a man swear he loves her , he replies , ' God keep your ladyship still in that mind ! so some gentlemen or other shall ' scape a predestinate scratched face . ' These words , uttered in the Chestnut Street Opera House in Philadelphia in 1883 , still ring in my cars ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Irving and Terry . All the scenes of Much Ado ' ? it was the first of Shakespeare 's comedies that I had seen ? come before me as I write . How electrified I was when Beatrice in the church scene cries out to Benedick to ' Kill Claudio ! ' And who that has heard it can forget Benedick 's soliloquy in the garden , in which he details the charms a woman must have ere he marry her , ending ' And her hair , her hair shall be of what color it please God . ' I have heard it said that Irving could neither talk , walk , nor act : that his mannerisms were offensive , that he was ' always Irving . ' I am willing for the sake of the argument to admit all that may be said in his despite ; but no actor in my day had such intellectuality , was so full of that quality we call magnetism , without which an actor can not reach the top of his profession . Call to mind Creston Clarke : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was conscientious and painstaking ; yet he left one cold . Irving was electrical ; one knew him for a great man . Who that has seen him can forget his noble brow , his piercing eye , his long and graceful hands ? And as for Ellen Terry ( dear Ellen Terry ' as Irving always called her in the little speeches which he used to make before the curtain ) , her delicious voice is still ringing in your ears , if , unluckily , your ears are as old as mine . Shall you ever forget her fascinating , if irregular , beauty ? When and where , and in what I saw these complementary and supplementary actors , what matters it ? Suffice it to say I saw them in all , or almost all , their great parts : in ' Romeo ' ? in which I confess Irving was awful but Terry lovely , ? in ' Lear , ' and ' The Merchant ' ; in Macbeth , and in Hamlet ? which was , I think , Irving 's greatest part ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which every man , woman , and child in the audience cried as frankly and openly as one does at a funeral . How well he played Charles the First ! Certainly no actor ever looked the part more perfectly than Irving : I can see him now in the leave-taking scene , with Ellen Terry crying quite as much as Henrietta Maria in real life could have done . Then there were those fine plays in which Irving acted without Terry ? Louis XI , Waterloo , and The Bells . In these , especially in Waterloo , Irving was supreme . As a character study it remains unsurpassed . The Bells I first saw in Philadelphia one winter 's night when there was so much snow on the ground that the street cars were not running , and I had to walk home after midnight , a distance of several miles . I had never seen such acting before . The bells ' continued to ring in my cars as I trudged along , and occasionally actual sleigh bells could be heard . To this day , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without thinking of Irving in the death scene where , as Mathias , he cries , ' Why is not Christian here ? ' Sound seems to have for me the reminiscent quality that smell has in others . In the early productions the part of Christian was taken by the gifted young actor William Terris : who ever saw a better lover than he ? What a matinee idbl he would have made ! only they hardly had matinee idols in those clays . And what a handsome and reels-less young villain he was as Thornhill in The Vicar ' ! Poor fellow ! When still a young man , not having an enemy in the world , he was stabbed by a lunatic at the stage-door of the Adelphi . I saw Irving in Ravenswood , a lugubrious dramatization of The Bride of Lammermoor which can not , I think , be called one of his successes , in The Amber Heart , of which I remember nothing , and in Madame Sans-Gene , of which what i remember I do not care for . What did , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1893 , a few months after the great poet 's death . Incidentally , in the years to which I am reverting , I scarcely ever went into Westminster Abbey without treading upon the new-made grave of some great man whose name was so vital to me that it seemed as if I were treading on a living thing . The names of Tennyson , Browning , and Irving instantly occur to me . Great men do n't die to-day ? they are all dead . But to return to Becket . It was a beautiful , dignified performance for which Irving was by nature especially suited . With what exquisite care it was produced ! How well one remembers the beauty of the first act . The curtain rises and reveals two men playing a game of chess : there is complete silence for a time , then moves are made and at last the King , beaten , knocks over the chessboard , and Church and State in the persons of Becket and the King come actually to grips . I never pass the Lyceum Theatre in Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night on my way to see a sporting melodrama , Good Luck , at Drury Lane ? without thinking of the wonderful ' first nights ' when it was the most fashionable theatre in London . For full twenty years Irving was on the crest of the wave . Nightly people stood in line at the pit entrance for hours , waiting for the doors to open ; and I when to save them from fatigue and exposure , Irving permitted them to secure reserved seats at the regular admission prices , they were so outraged that immediately they got in they tore up the seats and a riot was with difficulty averted . Who ever heard of the pit being reserved ? A three-century-old tradition had been violated : the old order of things was quickly restored . What is the Lyceum now ? It is given over to Hall-Caine melodrama at popular prices : no theatre in London has fallen so low . It is not , perhaps , surprising that Irving 's greatest financial , was not his greatest artistic , success . Faust , the most melodramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me unworthy of the great traditions of the Lyceum ? as better suited to Drury Lane , although Irving 's physical gifts and peculiarities especially fitted him in the part of Mephisto . In these days , when the production of elaborate spectacles is a matter of such ordinary event as to call for no comment whatever , a run of six hundred nights and takings ' of a million dollars seem nothing remarkable ; but in 1885 the world gasped . And well it might . Irving employed the best artists and spared neither pains nor expense to secure the most wonderful effects . The scene in the Brocken was really marvelous : elaborate electrical effects were used for the first time in a theatre ; electrically charged iron plates were so placed upon the stage that , when one stood upon two of them , an electric circuit was completed . In the fight between Faust and Valentine , when their swords clashed , sparks flashed therefrom as occasionally they did from Irving , as Mephisto ; and when he , in a scarlet robe , with red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its full height and hurled his curse at all and sundry ? well , the audience fairly gasped . Ellen Terry as Margaret was 304 LONDON IN THE EIGHTEEN ? EIGHTIES lovely , as always ; but my own feeling was that the play was not worthy of the powers of the actors . Irving was at his best in subtly intellectual parts ? parts in which the workings of his refined and melancholy face and above all , of his wonderful eyes , could be seen to better advantage than during the play of colored lights , in clouds of steam , and amidst the crash of stage thunder . I always regretted that I did not see him as Alfred Jingle , for in eccentric comedy Irving was as remarkable as in tragedy . Alas ! that there is always an apex to an actor 's career ? to any career . Why can we not , having been present at the glorious ascent , he spared the pain of witnessing the declension of our idols . Ellen Terry ? the lovely and lovable , whose voice was music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? began to grow old : after twenty-five years together she and Irving parted . There was no quarrel ; as has been said , their separation was due to the fact that she was no longer suited to play young girls ' parts , and to redeem financial losses , Irving became more and more inclined to melodramatic roles in plays in which there was no part for Terry . Could she who had delighted the town as Juliet , come to play the Nurse ? Irving , never a robust man , toward the last played against great physical weariness , and he died in harness . Becket was his last part , and his last words spoken on the stage were : ' Into thy hands , 0 Lord ! into thy hands ! ' At the bottom of St. Martin 's Lane , not far from the world 's worst statue ? that of Edith Cavell ? is a statue of Henry Irving , erected to his memory by friends in his profession . It shows Irving in academic robes and is in a deplorable condition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes covered , as with a veneer , with grime and dirt . The statue should be cleaned ; a few buckets of hot water and soap would soon set things right . I must write a letter to the Times about it . In the Guildhall Art Gallery , perhaps the most incongruous collection of art objects in the world , is a beautiful marble statue of Irving as Hamlet 1 ) ) Onslow Ford , the talented sculptor . who died young ; if it could have been reproduced in bronze it would have been a much finer monument to the great actor than the one which now represents him as an academician . IV In the days I am reviewing , just round the corner from the Lyceum , was the Gaiety Theatre . It was well named . The old building was swept away when the Strand was widened and Aldwych built , and to me , the name of the present Gaiety is a misnomer . Music and mirth have departed from it ; I have n't seen a good show there for years . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured lodgings , and then drove to Strand and bought theatre tickets at the Lyceum and Gaiety for alternate evenings . Those were the days , or nights , rather , when they always ran a burlesque there . They were light and witty and took a lot of acting , and I think it will be admitted that never before or since , on the London stage or any other , has there been seen such beautiful dancing . Kate Vaughan is credited with having introduced a new style of dancing which came to he called skirt dancing . She was enormously popular and at the height of her career is said to have received one pound per minute for her work upon the stage . The poetry of motion ' is a phrase which must have been invented to describe her exquisitely rhythmical movement . Later on came Sylvia Gray , Letty Lind , Marion Hood , and a host of others ? all of whom danced divinely . There was no suggestion of vulgarity in the best dancing at the Gaiety ; rather it seemed as though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in long frocks , soft and fluffy , with innumerable colored silk petticoats , had stumbled into the theatre while on their way to a very swagger garden-party , and , having done so , decided to lark it a bit with some interesting men they had quite innocently discovered . Then the orchestra began a tune , as infectious as it was original , and , in a moment , the stage was a blaze of multicolored Liberty-silk petticoats , out of which would occasionally project a silk-stockinged leg and a dainty foot . In those days the jeunesse dore of London might nightly be seen in the front rows of the stalls , picking out their brides reinvigorating the peerage , ' it was called . How these Gaiety shows ? Miss Esmeralda , Faust up to Date , Ruy Blas ? or the Blas ? Rou ? , and the rest ? caught . the town ! They were full of comedy , not too refined , and were as English as boiled beef and carrots . The English have always been great rhymers and punsters : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowers are in the country , to mutilate one of Oscar Wilde 's best witticisms . What fun was made by that great comedian , Fred Leslie , so graceful and accomplished , who died when he was but thirty-seven , his great ambition to play Hamlet unachieved ! And there was Arthur Roberts , another Gaiety at The spirit of comedy seems to have deserted the stage to-day . One form of amusement crowds out another . The Gaiety burlesques of my youth , themselves the followers of opera bouffe , an importation from the continent , gave way to musical comedies , ? Morocco Bound was the first voL. of them , ? as these have given way to vulgar and meaningless revues . I was speaking of Arthur Roberts . I saw him at the Pavilion a year or two ago , playing the part of an octogenarian in a bath-chair at Brighton , and doing it very well , too , talking to another old crony of his experiences in London before the war ? with Napoleon . But Arthur Roberts was a wag off the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was the hero . They are always holding exhibitions of one kind or another in London ? the Motor Show is the latest of them ; but in the year I have in mind they had an exhibition of foodstuffs ? they usually referred to it as ' The Healtheries . ' Food , en gros et en petit , was exhibited and occasionally samples would be given out . Well , one day Arthur Roberts had the bright idea of having a lot of cards printed ? ' Please Take One Home . ' These he stuck freely over pyramids of exhibits , ? tins of sardines , bottles of olives , boxes of dates , and the like , ? with the result that , before the distracted exhibitors realized what had occasioned it , thousands of small parcels were set in motion as if by magic . I have almost forgotten Nellie Farren ? ' Our Nelly ' as she was popularly called . She played boys ' parts , mostly , and at sixty was divine in tights . She and Fred Leslie played against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Vic and was an accomplished actress before she became the star of the Gaiety ? if the Gaiety can be said to have had any one bright particular star . She did not have an especially good singing voice , but she had wit , a rare thing in woman , and she was tireless in her efforts to please . I have mentioned Letty Lind : she was a tall , blonde , dangerously demure creature who early danced her way into the hearts of her audience and stayed there ; 306 LONDON IN THE EIGHTEEN ? EIGHTIES but my own passion was for Sylvia Gray , who is now the Mrs. Fenwick one reads about in the newspapers as a daring rider in the Quorn Hunt . But good things must come to an end : Fred Leslie died , Nellie Farren retired wisely at the height of her fame , and the famous beauties married and lived happily ever after ? let us hope ! A new theatre , Daly 's , opened to divide with the Gaiety the patronage of those in search of music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , The Geisha , San Toy , A Country Girl , and The Merry Widow ran for a total of ten years . One of the greatest successes of a slightly earlier period was The Belle of New York , an importation which succeeded in spite of a onetime prejudice against an American musical comedy . It ran ? somewhere over here ? for two years or more , thanks to its tuneful music and the ability of that excellent comedian , Dan Daly , and the charms of the demure Salvation Army Girl , Edna May , who soon became a peeress and is now the widow of one of America 's very rich men . Shall we ever forget Florodora with its famous double sextette ? ' Tell me pretty maiden ' ? There are ladies , now firmly established in high places , who owe their rank largely to the fact that in the original sextette ' they were given a chance to display such charms as , in the past , have changed the course of empire . When I saw Florodora in London , Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard her sing When I Leave Town , ' ? you remember it ? ? one verse goes : And she had , too . With the Arcadians , musical-comedy shows came practically to an end . It ran for over two years in London and then came to New York where I first saw it . I have forgotten the name of the man who played the high comedy part ; but the lugubrious jockey with his song , ' Always Merry and Bright , ' was the inimitable Alfred Lester . In it , too , was Connie Ediss , a vulgar cockney comedienne with a rasping voice , graduated from ' the halls ' ? a great favorite of mine . And what was the name of the girl who sang Tin so tired of violets ' so delightfully ? But I must be careful not to mix an dates . I am verging upon the present , Most writing about the theatre is done by old men who paint the past in radiant colors against the dull background of the present . I can not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before leaving this subject I want to remind my severest critic ? my wife ? that twenty-odd years ago , when we were enjoying to the full the wonderful shows then being given at Weber and Fields 's in New York , I said that never before had there been , and in all probability never again could there be , assembled in any theatre such a brilliant caste as that which , in addition to these two clever comedians themselves , included Charles Ross , Peter Daly , and Dave Warfield among the men , and Lillian Russell ? and here I fall into reverie from which I do not wish to be disturbed . V I could , if it were necessary , give the exact date upon which I took a young and charming lady ? the lady afore- said , indeed , now a grandmother and wearing glasses very becomingly ? into a small music hall in the Strand , and saw , through a haze of fog and tobacco smoke , a large fat man in ridiculous trousers , and listened to a song in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful ! ' I said to my little bride , gasping for breath at my side . ' That 's Herbert Campbell , one of the most popular music-hall artists in London . ' Artists ! ' the girl cried , ' I think he 's disgusting . ' Never mind , ' I replied , ' that feeling is like seasickness ; you 'll get over it ; keep quiet and listen to the words and try to learn them ' ; and joining in the chorus I sang at the top of my voice : Herbert Campbell was a large man with an unctuous voice , enormously popular with his audience , and much in demand for pantomimes at Drury Lane , for which , on account of his size , he was particularly well adapted . His once popular song would n't go now : the present Prince of Wales is the most popular man in England . Who shall explain the popularity of a song ? What quality is it of words or music that gives it vitality ? When I was last in Buffalo I visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then being made , under the direction of a distinguished citizen , Judge Louis B. Hart , to preserve for all time the once popular songs of the nation , the abstract and brief chronicles of their time . Songs may be as important in a nation 's history as its laws ; frequently they are written by wiser men . Let us join in singing ' Grandfather 's Clock , ' which swept over America in the Centennial year , 1876 . And let us not forget ' Silver Threads among the Gold , ' or ' After the Ball , ' which is the musical monument of the World 's Fair in Chicago in 1893 . These unconsidered trifles have , of course , no musical or literary value , but in after years they will be interesting as showing the varying sophistications of their day . To return to London . In what year was it ( upon the day when it had been discovered that Charles Stewart Parnell , the great Irish leader , had been indulging in an illicit amour with Mrs. O'Shea ) that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , the words and music of which had been written only a few hours before ? I remember that the chorus went something like this : The next lines I forget , but the last lines were : Instantly there was a riot ; when two or three Irishmen are gathered together there usually is . The Irish determined that the song should not be sung ; the English wanted it badly . We were a hundred to one ? but what are odds to an Irishman ? While it lasted it was a very pretty scrap , but just as it was getting interesting the policemen came and put an end to it , just as firemen do to a fire ? I could never understand why . If I was not the first person in America to sing Lottie Collins 's great song , ' I do n't want the credit for it ; but certainly I was her most steadfast defender when anyone happened to say that that song was not designed to be sung by a perfect lady . No , I am mistaken ; 308 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way challenged was not Lottie Collins 's acrobatic song and dance , which swept round the world as it deserved to ; it was another balladic masterpiece : - LIt was the pathetic story of a beautiful young country girl who came to London to see the sights , ' with her golden hair a-hanging down her back . ' It took many stanzas to tell of the experiences that befell her : her name was Flo , and the chorus went this way : I well remember the fate of my copy of this song . My wife , growing tired of playing my accompaniments , once remarked to herself : ' I wish someone would burn this song ! ; whereupon my daughter , then a girl of seven , before anyone could stop her , placed it upon the embers of a wood fire . But the words of most of it have been burnt into my brain . Does anyone remember the rattling chorus ? If you have forgotten it , I would be pleased to sing it for a small remuneration . I learned it with lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was conveyed with a broken leg just thirty years ago to-morrow . How can a lot of boys and men more harmlessly spend two or three hours of an evening , after a hard day 's work , than in listening to and singing a lot of nonsensical , and sometimes absurdly sentimental , songs ? Do n't let us try too hard to ' uplift ' our fellows in the street . Life is a dull , unhappy business at best for them ; before they were born the cards were stacked ; the chances against them are ten thousand to one . Think of the homes that many of the patrons of the halls come from ! Think of the streets into which they must go for recreation and remember that The streets of London are ceaselessly interesting and Coster songs , as sung by Gus Ellen , and above all by that great artist , Albert Chevalier , have always had a powerful fascination for ma Poor fellow , Chevalier died not long ago , and his books were sold at auction only last week . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become of Vesta Tilley ? later to become Lady de Freece ? who for years wore men 's clothes , es . pecially evening clothes , better than most men , and sang and danced in them to the distraction of the chappies about town . The ' Great Little Tilley ' she was called , and she deserved both adjectives . She was christened Matilda and assumed the name of Vesta from a match box . Wherever she is , I hope she is happy . She ought to be for she has given so much and such innocent pleasure . At one time she was earning . not being paid merely , as much as ? 500 a week . Nor have I forgotten Vesta Victoria ( I do n't suppose she was so christened ) with her famous song , ? Waiting at the Church ' ? the words and music of which are kept under lock and key at home , lest it , too , may find its way into the fire . Marie Lloyd ? another great favorite . I happened to be in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her line , and a great to-do was made at her funeral . She was vulgar , but droll . and enormously popular . At the time of her death she supposed herself to be very rich , and left a lot of money to charity ; but she had lived rich and died , as so many of her profession do , poor . Years ago , when she first became popular , the story goes of a man in London for the first time , being shown the sights by a friend who , although long a resident , was not over-sure of his facts . On top of a horse-drawn bus , the town innocent explained to the country innocent this building and that , not often giving the building its proper name . But the driver who knew every inch of the road was imperturbable . At last , nearing St. Paul 's , the countryman inquired , ' What is the name of that statue there ? ' For several centuries it has been Queen Anne ; but the Cockney , at a loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face like a frostbitten apple , turned round and , chuckling to himself said , ' Do n't ' esitate , do n't ' esitate , say its Marie Lloyd . ' Who that has seen him has forgotten Dan Leno ? He was an exquisite artist , always in trouble ? on the stage ; poor fellow , if I am not mistaken , he went insane . ' Genius is to insanity allied , ' and Dan Leno was a genius . He made you laugh inside rather than oat ; no smutty word or suggestion ever came from him . He was a little fellow and when , during the Christmas pantomime , Drury Lane claimed him , he was lost in the immensity of that huge stage ; but at the Tivoli , gone now , alas , he was in his element . I do not seem to remember any songs of his , but as a dancer he was superb . Fifty years ago , nearly , at Tony Pastor 's in New York , I remember two black-faced comedians who used to sing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patter of feet as faultlessly rhythmical as a verse by Swinburne . This forgotten jingle suggests one of Dan Leno 's great accomplishments : with his educated feet , sometimes in shoes almost as long as he was tall , he would clog-dance with a grace and agility that I have never seen equaled . Even Royalty , and Royalty is hard to amuse , found him amusing . But the old-fashioned music hall was not entirely given over to song and dance . I have seen animals do incredible things ; I have seen cyclists ride wheels until my heart was in my mouth ; I have seen feats of strength , and I have heard ' Dates , ' the man whose memory was so remarkable that he could , as he said , ' give the correct answer to any question found in the following books of reference . ' Then followed a long list ? and he could do it too . I primed myself to catch him , as others did , but always failed . Tumblers and acrobats , too , I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Cinquevalli is no more . He was an Austrian , his right name was Kestner , a sensitive gentleman ; the war broke his heart . As a juggler , I suppose he never had an equal . I have seen him keep in the air , at one time , a cannon ball , an egg , and a lighted lamp . At a music hall as long as I can smoke , I can stand anything . ' Jonathan Wild is not too low for me , nor Shaftesbury too genteel ' ; but I hate a contortionist . When a contortionist comes on , I always close my eyes and sometimes go to sleep . Many years ago , in the smoke-room of the old Teutonic , I fell into conversation with a man about ' the halls . ' I am glad that you enjoy them , ' he said ; ' you have probably seen me . ' I looked at him carefully and tried to place him , but could not , and I told him so .
