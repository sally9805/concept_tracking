txt The . terrible events in Dublin on Sunday are like a burst of flame , lighting up the immense difficulties of the Irish problem . On one side we see t.40 darker elements of the Irish agitation  --  a criminal ferocity displayed in brutal and cowardly assassinations . On the other side English blundering comes into view . It was a blunder to ' leave English officers unguarded in hotels and lodging houses , where murderers could walk into their rooms at a fixed hour and shoot them down without giving them a dog 's chance . It was another blunder , in the lawful and necessary pursuit of the assassins , so to act as to give color to the charge that machine guns had opened fire on a crowd at a game . All the details are not yet precisely known . But , the main facts ' are of the same kind that has been making ' the heart sick for tvo years past  --  the fierce clashing of two races , the malign frustration of every attempt to arrive at a reasonable settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wrote Lord ROSEBERY , " has not passed into his " tory because it has never passed out " of politics .

The Presidential election being over , people in this country may now seek to take a calmer and fairer View of the Irish troubles . In trying to hold the scales even , Americans had better be modest about proposing remedies for the deep-seated Irish disease . We are not in possession of an infallible cure . Beware of the man who claim 's to have a panacea for Ireland . Neither Ireland nor England would welcome any meddling and quack practitioners from this side . Let us frankly admit that if the Irish problem of today were referred to tile combined wisdom of the American .

The iron composure of PARwpm himself was broken through , and be thought for a time of resigning the Irish leadership . Today the disgrace of assassination does not seem to be so keenly felt . But however this may be in Ireland , in the United States there ought to be no hesitation in denouncing such atrocious crimes as those in Dublin . If Iiishrtien look to this country for " sympathy " with cowardly slaughter , they should be told that they will look in vain ; and that to seize the weapons of murder can only stiffen the purpose ' and strengthen the hands of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The next President of the United States squarely and truthfully deejoed in the course of the campaign that the question of Irish government Was a " domestic " affair of Great Britain , with ? which we had no right to interfere .
