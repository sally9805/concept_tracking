Australia proposes a Federal Education Bureau to coordinate education in the commonwealth . At the same time , projects for education by travel are being much discussed . Thirty day travel trips covering New Zealand , South Africa , New Guinea , Ceylon and the islands , interstate tours and tours around the world have been suggested . The impetus is supposed to come from the success of the Rhodes scholarships and the experience of Australians overseas during the war . There are about 4,500 Australians at school in England this year .
