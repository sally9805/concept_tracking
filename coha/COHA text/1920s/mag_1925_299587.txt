Doctors warned Premier Edouard Herriot , still abed sick with a swollen leg , that his condition did not warrant him taking an active part in politics . Rumors ran around that the Premier would soon resign and the Ministry with him . Whether or no the Premier is going to take his doctors ' advice is another matter ; but it was generally believed that his health could not long stand the strain of Chamber debate . <P> Ex-Premier Paul Painlev , President of the Chamber of Deputies , was mentioned as next Premier . His chances would not appear so good as those of ex-Premier Aristide Briand , who is reputed to have a larger following among the discordant elements from which any new Government must be formed . The Nationalists-Millerand Poincar &; Co. - can be expected to force matters as far toward a general election as is possible . <P> Under the present disposition of parties in the Chamber of Deputies , M , Herriot has probably the best chance of any Minister of keping a Government in power-and his chances are not too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powers , particularly Britain , with whom relations grow more cor dial clay by day , his weakness in domestic matters is to a large extent offset ; and he might well , despite contrary statements , be expected to survive in office a while longer , were it not for his illness .
