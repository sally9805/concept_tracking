Jolly British tars were grave , last week , at news that the submarine L55 had been raised from Baltic waters , after nine years . Forty-one British skeletons were discovered by the salvage crew all of whom were Soviet Russian sailors , commanded by Comrade Chief Commander ( Admiral ) R. A. Muklevich . Said he : <P> " Involuntarily the question arises what were the English seeking in our territorial waters in 1919 ? Without any formal declaration of war they attacked us , sank our ships and bombarded our forts . The English monitor Erebus frequently fired her 15-in. guns at our fort , Red Hill . The English broke into our house by the right of might to kill the workers and peasants and to turn back the wheel of revolution . <P> " In numerous fruitless battles with the Soviet forces , between Dec. 18 , 1918 , and Aug. 19 , 1919 , the British lost twelve other ships : the light cruiser Cassandra , the mine carriers Victoria , Verulam , Gentian and Myrtle , and seven torpedo cutters . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our enemies , but the Red sailors nourish no enmity against them . The English sailors carried out the will of those who sent them and perished . We shall consider the wishes of the English Government concerning their burial and disposition of their personal property . In any case their remains will be interred with full military honors . " <P> At London the British Admiralty released a communiqu from which three facts appeared . First that the British were now receiving the first official intimation that the L55 was ever sunk . Second that the Admiralty had announced on June 12 , 1919 , eight days after the sinking , that a submarine ( unnamed ) was missing from the British Baltic Fleet . Third , that the relatives and next of kin of the Britishmen lost on the L55 were privily notified . <P> At Kronstadt , of course , Red sailors held jollifications and high jinks . They knew that the L55 is a noble prize of a war which , although never declared ( see France ) , was nonetheless hotly fought . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as large as the recently raised U.S. submarine S-4 ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) , and twice as large as the Italian F14 , sunk and raised last fortnight . Soviet technicians added to the jollification by announcing that the Red sailors ' prize is in sufficiently good condition ' to be made serviceable , seaworthy , deadly . Citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations were hopefully and confidently doubtful that the L55 will ever sink a British ship .
