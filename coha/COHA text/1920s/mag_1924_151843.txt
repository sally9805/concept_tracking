Flying over the barren waste of the Alaska Peninsula , surrounded by a heavy fog that blotted out the desolate , treeless , uninhabited shores below , two aviators , speeding westward , crashed against a mountain side . Miraculously uninjured , they picked themselves from the wreck of their plane and started on a search for life , warmth , food . For seven days they labored across that rough , uneven country . At the end of a week they came to a trapper 's cabin on the southern tip of Port Moller Bay , nearly at the end of the peninsula . From this haven they flashed back word that they were safe . <P> Thus ended a ten-day search for Major Frederick L. Martin and his mechanic , Staff Sergeant Alva L. Harvey . Major Martin was commander of the U. S. Army air fleet of four planes set out to circumnavigate the world ( TIME , March 24 ) . <P> While Major Martin and his companion were searching for civilization , the U. S. Government was pursuing an intensive search for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make is being made to find these gallant men . " Two U. S. Coast Guard cutters ploughed the gale-lashed waters of the North Pacific day and night . At every bay and inlet a small boat was put off and a search was made of the adjoining land . At night the two ships ' glaring searchlights swept the desolate coast . <P> Major Martin wired Major Gen. Mason M. Patrick , Chief of Army Air Service : " Crashed against mountain in fog at 12:30 o'clock . Neither hurt but ship total wreck . Our existence due to concentrated food and nerve . Arrived at a trapper 's cabin , southernmost point of Port Moller 's Bay , morning 7th , exhausted . Found food . Rested three days . Walked to beach . Awaiting instructions here . " <P> Said Mrs. Frederick L. Martin , informed that her husband was safe : " I am going to ask Fred to make the greatest sacrifice he ever made in his life : I want him to promise me he will never fly again . . . . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came to my sister 's house where I have been staying . . . and his face was radiant with smiles . Instinctively , I knew he had brought me good news . "
