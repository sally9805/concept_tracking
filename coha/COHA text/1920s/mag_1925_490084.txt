stranger . There was a time when I saw a great many of these meetings , and they always ended the same way  --  Hopkins emerged from them with a slightly stricken look , probably three parts remorse and two parts belligerency , and the stranger came out looking desperately for the stairs , wetting his throat and obviously at a loss as to what he had come for , what had happened to him , and how he could get away . It was , in fact , no help to the stranger if he had been warned beforehand , as who should know better than I , who have warned a hundred of them . He could not overcome the paralysis of throat , intelligence and feeling that Hopkins induced in him . I have often wondered what Arthur Hopkins really thought of the human race , since he always made the acquaintance of it when it was thus at its worst . However , the explanation of this Hopkins blight is easy , even if futile . This timid little man  --  and how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easing human intercourse . That would not be so bad , if he would let it alone  --  but he will not . Some perverse Welsh demon in him drives him to let on that he is equal to any situation . He adopts all the outward behavior of a man who knows precisely what he is about . His very first greeting is done with an air . In fact , it is done with such a devil of an air that the incomer is at once abashed , and dries up into a state resembling that of a frightened pupil before a stern school teacher . Do not think that this merely applies to the young and uninitiated . The very toughest of them go down before it . I have seen the jauntiest and most experienced of persons saunter in to an interview with Arthur Hopkins and come out with the same old glazed and staring eye . They all vow that Hopkins has frightened them to death . What actually happened , of course , was that they had one and all frightened Hopkins to death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he can shine , and that they had then been betrayed by the perfection of his own defense against his greatest weakness . Once in a while Arthur Hopkins becomes articulate  - -  but the times arc rare . In a better world than this , where some sagacious overlord directed what each of us might and might not do , separating us according to our gifts , Hopkins would be kept in a small cage back of the footlights of his own theatre , and never by any chance allowed to come in contact with actual people . What Hopkins knows he knows from the inside , anyway . He learns nothing from people , because he ca n't pass his own walls , any more than they can . He has vast intuitive knowledge . He has an extraordinary taste for the best that the theatre can do , and he has all the necmary courage for putting that best to the fore . But all he now has he had the day he was born , and it is literally ruinous for him to try to enlarge his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunts , who knew him as a child . " He was a curious little boy , " she said , " and none of the children could ever make him out . No more could we , if it comes to that . He hardly ever said a word . I do n't mean he was one of these sickly , bored children  --  he was n't  --  but he was always preoccupied with something the rest of us could n't see . " Well , he still is , of course , but it is to be said to his credit that he now does the best he can to make the rest of us see what he is pondering over . He can never do it with the direct human relationship as his only outlet , because time has given him no graces whatever in that particular mode . He still merely freezes himself and the rest of the world into lumpy masses when he tries . But he can come very near to doing that with the production of a successful play . Only one disability remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is his distaste for resorting to the good old theatrical smash . He is filled with a philosophy  --  of his own devising  --  that one may speak under the noise rather than over it , in the theatre as in the subway . He will not admit that the theatre speaks its own language and no other . " Not at all , " he says confidently , " it will speak mine if I give it a chance . " So he goes along , production after production , shouting in whispers . He would have been buried under long ago but that some treacherous cunning he contains , against which he would certainly make war if he realized it , has led him , on important occasions , to pick actors who could and did crash through his ablest plans . Hopkins is all for silken harmony . He can create it , too , better than anybody else in the world , if he has a company of obedient actors . He can create it , and it will run for all of one week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest of the producers , is precisely where Nazimova , John Barrymore , or somebody other blazing person , has crashed through his fine-spun scheme . This contradiction of himself which he has repeatedly sponsored is at the bottom of all the conflicting opinions one hears about him . I have heard themost acute of critics divided  --  even unto their own minds  --  as to whether Arthur Hopkins was the best producer in America or the worst . It is pretty easy , of course , to say that Arthur Hopkins is a great producer when he has an actor who will be sure to get out of hand , and not otherwise . But it is dangerously easy . It may not be true . It may quite as well he true that he knows all about it beforehand , and counts on it , wants it , and will do everything to get it but admit that he would like it . It is certainly true that Arthur Hopkins is far better in the theatre than any theory he ever held . His theories read well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen more animation in him , more fluency and more energy , when he was expounding a theory that would land him flat on his nose , than I have ever seen when he had done exactly that thing for which his entire world rose to applaud him . But for better or worse , there he is , little enough likely to be understood , not only because his work bears divided evidence , but because in any personal contact he is as unyielding as a stone , and I can not but believe that his times are the better for him . Something , surely , can be got out of a man who is , though timid , greatly courageous , and who , though obstinate , is religiously and deeply devoted to those thinps he does believe in.
