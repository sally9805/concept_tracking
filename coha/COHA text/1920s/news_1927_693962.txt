txt Stretches of fog hundreds of miles long and rain-swept seas between Newfoundland and the coast of Ireland kept Commander Richard E. Byrd 's America landlocked again today , with the probability that the great triple-motored plane will not soar into the air Paris-bound until Monday at the earliest , and more likely not until Tuesday . Until late yesterday afternoon the fliers had entertained hope of winging off over the Atlantic early Monday , but a report received at the hangar here at 6 o'clock indicated that the . barrier of rain and mist would not lift until the day following . " Skies are generally clear and visibility good eastward and northeastward from New York to about 45 degrees latitude , " said the weather report compiled yesterday by James H. Kimball , meteorologist of the weather bureau in New York , in his special report for the transatlantic fliers . " But , " he added , " clouds and rain apparently prevail generally from there to the Irish Coast . Fog is reported at Basque ; Cape Race and Harrington , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flying conditions are good over the steamer route nearly to mid-Atlantic , but bad from there eastward . " Bennett Visits Field . Except for a visit from Floyd Bennett , Commander Byrd 's companion on his flight over the North Pole last Summer , there was little activity about the America 's hangar today . The plane rested on the ground with only 300 gallons of gas in its tanks , of the 1,300 required for the transoceanic flight . Despite the apparent calm a restless spirit of anticipation prevailed about the hangar of the America . Ever ? and anen. mechanics or the pilots themselves cast brief glances at the sky as if to glean from the fleecy clouds over Garden City some indication of the temper of the weather over the long gray stretch of the North Atlantic . The uneasy monotony was broken when Bennett appeared , his right leg in a plaster cast , his left braced with steel splints and yards of bandages . It was the first time he had seen the America since his narrow escape on April 26 , when , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls , the plane had turned over at the end of its first test flight at Teterboro Airport , near Hackensack . N. J. It was like a meeting between two old friends . Hobbling out on crutches , Bennett cast a caressing glance over the long , graceful sweep of the Amerlea 's wings . " Well , this looks more like it , " he remarked . " Last time I saw you , you were lying on your back looking up at me  --  and I was n't paying much attention . " He came out from St. Vincent 's Hospital , accompanied by his wife , by Dr. Raymond T. Sullivan , his physician ; Lieutenant Bernt Balchan , engineer of the Fokker Company , and Miss Caroline Lechner , his nurse . Commander Byrd had been awaiting him since 11 o'clock , and with him were Grover A. Whalen , representing Rodman Wanamaker , owner of the plane ; George 0 . Noville , one pilot in the projected flight , and Bert Acosta , holder , with Clar , ence Chamberlin , of the endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . Tim Melroy , chief engineer of the Chantier , the ship that took Byrd and Bennett to Spitzbergen for the polar flight , was also there . Byrd Greets Him Warmly . When Bennett drove up in a car with his party , Commander Byrd rushed out to greet him enthusiastically . " By George , I never thought I 'd see you out this way again , " he said , wringing Bennett 's hand . He looked Bennett up and down with a broad grin of pleasure . Then they walked out to the plane , Dr. Sullivan always keeping close at hand . After . a longing glance at the America , Bennett , hobbling along slowly on his crutches , made a complete circuit of the ship , then managed to climb up on a platform to obtain a better view . " Better watch him , " said Mr. Whalen with a wink to Commander Byrd . " He 'll be hopping into the cockpit and starting this flight right now . The two men , who hold between them the record of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their projected trip by air to the South Pole as if it were a settled matter . Commander Byrd told reporters later that a principal reason for Bennett 's trip to the hangar was to go over details of the polar flight . " Certainly , Bennett is going to the South Pole with me , " he said . " That man will go as second in command or as co-commander with me . But I 'd prefer not to make any definite announcement on it just now . " The party went to the home of Robert W. Daniel , friend of Commander Byrd , at Westbury , for Lunch . As they left Doc Kinkade and Mulroy were stowing 5-gallon cans of gasoline . part of a supplementary supply for the transatlantic hop , in the navigator 's cabin of the plane . Plans for Ocean Photography . A photographic record of the transatlantic flight will be made , Lieutenant Noville announced yesterday . He said he planned to make the first motion pictures ever taken on a voyage across the Atlantic by air . The pictures will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subjects , he said , will be Commander Byrd and Acosta while guiding the airplane , the last North American land seen from the plane , the first landfall on the other side , interesting cloud formations , and the landing in Paris . " I 'm going to photograph anything that looks interesting on the way over , " he added . " I 'll probably like them all through the window , though I may go up on top of the plane . We want the pictures as a sort of record of the flight . I do n't know but what they may be given to some museum later . I 'm busy every day practicing with the cameras . " In addition to his work as flight engineer and as official photographer , Lieutenant Noville will be in charge of the radio work . He plans to send messages at intervals of two hours throughout the trip , giving the progress of plane . The range of the radio equipment is between 250 and 500 miles by day and probably more during the night hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters , with provisions for transmitting on 600 meters , the " stand by " wave length of commercial ship stations , for calling purposes and for distress signals , if they should be necessary . The radio equipment was designed by Malcolm P. Hansen of the Naval Research Laboratories at Bellevue . D. C. , and is a modification of the latest standard navy aircraft transmitter . It is rated at 150 watts . operates on two fifty-watt tubes , and is of the self-rectifying , alternating current , continuous wave type . It weighs twenty-four pounds exclusive of the antenna , which consists of a single piece of bare copper wire 450 feet long with a streamlike weight at the end . The antenna winds up on a reel and a spare is carried . With the hour for the start again delayed , the aviators abandoned plans for " serious sleeping . " They made no effort to get to bed earlier than usual , but were still at the hangar late this evening .

They also delayed ordering the supply of food they will carry on the flight , although they already have stowed aboard the America an emergency supply of army rations , pemmican and malted-milk tablets . Study British Reports . Tonight the fliers were studying the following message from the meteorological office of the British Air Ministry , indicating what weather 49 degrees north , moving rapidly northeast . Between Ireland and longitude 25 degrees west , the weather is cloudy and there are low clouds with rain or drizzle . Between 10 and 20 degrees west a general westerly current of a velocity of about fifty miles per hour is to be found at an elevation of 2,000 feet at present . " Further depressions are likely to form in the mid-Atlantic and move northeast , maintaining unsettled weather . The wind at Valencia , Ireland , at 18,000 feet will continue between southwest and west at a velocity of about eighty miles per hour .
