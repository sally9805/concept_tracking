txt The fight is off . At half-past twelve tonight Jack Kearns made his final offer to George H. Stanton , representing the business men of Great Falls . He proposed to wait till noon tomorrow for the payment of the last money due Jack Dempsey . If at that time the fight promoters had $50,000 in cash Kearns would take the rest out of the gate receipts . Stanton . resistant as usual , at first said that Loy Molumby , the promoter , might be able to raise it ; then said he doubted if it could be raised and that consequently this meant the fight was off . " All right , " said Kearns , " that goes for me . The fight is off . " If this proposal had been accepted it would have meant that Kearn 's $50,000 ' would have been a first charge on the gate receipts , which were already loaded with two prior first charges . In view of the attitude of the management oe its individual members , who have been falling over each other trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse , there was not a chance in the world that Montana would have raised this $50.000 . Major J. E. Lane , who took charge of the fight on Friday afternoon , came to Kearns Monday morning and told him that the fight finances and the ticket sale were in a hopeless muddle ; that nobody knew what tickets were out or what receipts had come in : that there was only $10,000 in the treasury , and that the attempt to raise the final $100,000 in twenty pledges of $5,000 each had failed . He asked Kearns to take his chance on getting the last hundred thousand out of the gate receipts , and when Kearns asked what about the other unpaid expenses of the bout  --  the referee , gate keepers , preliminary fighters and so on , Lane could give him no answer . Kearns says he then telephoned to Shelby and learned that there was only $4,000 in the treasury  --  a shrinkage , apparently , of $6,000 over night . Then Lane withdrew . gave up his attempt to raise the last $100,000 and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson of Shelby drove down to Great Falls this afternoon and it was reported that he had brought $25,000 in cash and mortgages on his property to meet the last demand . He had not . He got here at 7 o'clock . went . to Stanton 's room in the Stanton Bank , and stayed there until midnight . Stanton told reporters at the hotel at 11 o'clock that no effort had been made to raise any money Monday afternoon and that the committee was waiting untli midnight . He added that advice of counsel was that the contract was not broken by thi sfailure to produce the money on the day set and that Dempsey must appear at the ringside on July 4 . Kearns Changes Attitude . When this news was brought to Kearns in his room in the Park Hotel it caused a visible change in his manner . There is reason to believe that hitherto he had been inclined to wait till the stroke of twelve and then announce that he was ready to take his chance on the gate for the last $100,000 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have nothing more in the way of discussion of the fight , Kearns was evidently inclined to call the event off . Five minutes before midnight , however , Judge Roy E. Ayers , representing Major Lane , appeared at the hotel and talked to Kearns . He made no offer , however , and at five , minutes after twelve Kearns reappeared with Loy Molumby , original promoter of the fight . Molumby had suggested that about $25,000 might be raised and Kearns did not think that was enough . Standing in a smoke-filled room , straw hat slanted on hi shead and hands in his pockets , he stood , obviously uncertain , and said mrely that nobody had made him an offer . Would Take $50,000 . " Loy , " he said , turning to Molumby , . " do you think you could raise fifty thousand ? I 'd take the gate for the rest . " " I do n't know . " said Molumby . " I 'll try . " " I want to know . ' said Kearns , not unreasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was suggested that Mr. Stanton , who was in the lobby . be brought up , and for the first time the two met . Kearns asked Stanton what he could propose , and Stanton passed the buck back to Major Lane , who had already Passed the buck to others . There was more uncertainty . " Has any money been offered you today ? " Kearns was asked . " Not a dime , " he said . In response to a question , Stanton I said that Great Falls and Shelby felt that Dempsey ought to fight and take his chances on the gate . Kearns finally proposed to give the local men twelve hours more to raise half the money and take the rest out of the gate , with the result told above . Nobody was willing to take the responsibility : the fight had beef handed back to liolumby. the original promoter , who had plenty of willingness but nothing more . Situation Is Tense . Not since the time when President Wilson went into the silences to commune with his soul and decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there been such feverish tension as existed in Great Falls tonight , when the populace waited till midnight to see whether Jack Kearns was going to weaken or hold to his determination of no last hundred thousand no fight . It is true that the feverish tension existed mainly among the experts in diplomacy end high finance who are covering this projected prize fight , and not among the inhabitants . Great Falls is entertainingan Elks convention , and the populace is listening to the noise of Elks and Elkesses while the great problem Is Milting itself out In the soul of Jack Kearns . upstairs in a room at the Park Hotel this strong , silent man is wrestling with the great decision . He is not wrestling with it in the same room all the time , for now and then newspaper men find out what room he is in and go up to ask him , and then he moves to another MOM . Meanwhile in the lobby downstairs everybody who was ever seen speaking to Jack Kearns was taken for a lastminute authority on the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp to try to get a job as sparring partners and got the gate instead , were eagerly buzzed for their opinions . A poll taken in the lobby at 10:20 mountain time ( 1:20 A. M. New York time ) discloses the opinion prevalent by a margin of about four to one that Mr. Kearns would be smitten with magnanimity and agree to sink his principles and accept the beggardly pittance of two hundred thousand . The proponents of the story argued from general and unassailable principles . that he just plain could n't take Montana 's money and walk out of the State . That he had his highly polished champion brought up to the edge and would n't want to let him slide back without fighting somebody ; that a refusal to go through with the fight now would kill Dempsey with the public or kill the fight game with the public , that $200,000 was a lot of money , anybody would fight for it , and so on . Against that the other side reasoned that Mr. Reams was never known to take less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the argument went while upstairs Mr. Kearns devoted his time to the process of thought and the samaritan occupation of rubbing camphor on the leg of a New York newspaper man who had collapsed at dinner .
