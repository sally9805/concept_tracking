It once made a burgher feel big to buy operas and plays and for a particular evening he commissioned one of each . The singers arrived , the actors arrived , but the burgher wanted his art short . Opera plus play would take too long so he ordered them run off together . On such a farcical notion did Moliere make his Bourgeois Gentilhomme . Hugo von Hofmannsthal used it for Ariadne auf Naxos for which Richard Strauss wrote the music . Last week the Strauss-von-Hofmannsthal opus , given first in Stuttgart in 1912 with Maria Jeritza , had its U. S. premire-with the enterprising Philadelphia Civic Opera Company . <P> Ariadne , never among the most successful of Strauss operas , has had frequent amendments . In its present form there is a prologue and one act , which makes a play within the play . Ariadne , tragically abandoned by Theseus , must listen to the cajolery of Zerbinetta , the comedienne ; listens to learn and herself turns finally to Bacchus . All this Strauss has set to droll , delightful music which demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality . Philadelphia singers lacked the necessary virtuosity last week but Alexander Smallens almost atoned with his 37-piece orchestra .
