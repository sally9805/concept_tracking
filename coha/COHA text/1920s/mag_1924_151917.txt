Anna Pavlova , aged 39 , Titania of the Imperial Russian school of romantic choregraphy , is soon to embark on a farewell tour of the U. S. This in spite of the fact that her last appearances here were also farewell appearances . This time , however , it is " positively farewell , " because Anna , says her manager , S. Hurok , is weary of the discomforts of travel . Consequently , a rather unexacting final circuit has been arranged . It will consist of four weeks at Covent Garden , London ; three and one-half weeks at the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan ; then a " season " in San Francisco ; finally a first , last and only tour of Australia . Thereafter the most skilful toes in the world will be on view only to a select band of pupils in the Pavlova London home . Anna expects to devote the remainder of her days to painting and sculpture .
