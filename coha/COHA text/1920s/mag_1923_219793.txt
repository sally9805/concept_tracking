A year ago the National League of Women Voters held its annual convention in Baltimore . By its invitation a conference of Pan-American women also assembled there at that time . An inquiring South American delegate , Senorita Mandujano , of Chile , asked for a list of the twelve greatest women in the United States of whom she wished to write for the South American public . The League consented to supply the list . <P> But when the attempt was made such a flood of female greatness appeared , that the League was swamped and impotent to choose without offense and injustice . Finally a committee was appointed , and now , a year later , the committee reports a list of twelve " greatests . " The women were chosen one for each profession or occupation . The list as now drawn up reads : <P> Jane Addams ... philanthropy <P> Cecelia Beaux ... painting <P> Anna Jump Cannon ... astronomy <P> Carrie Chapman Catt ... politics <P> Anna Botsford Comstock ... natural history <P> Minnie Maddern Fiske ... stage <P> Louise Homer ... music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... anatomy <P> M.
