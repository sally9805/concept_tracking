A Plot . According to Dr. Harrison E. Howe , Editor of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry , a " plot " is under way to divert public interest from helium . Asserting that electrical sparks twelve to eighteen inches in length were seen on the helium-filled Shenandoah on the night of its great adventure ( TIME , Jan. 28 ) and that these sparks would have set it on fire , had it been filled with hydrogen , Dr. Howe-through the pages of his journal-demanded to know why this important fact has been overlooked in official and press discussions . " What is back of this obvious effort to have the American people forget helium ? " <P> Then-in a direct personal attack- the famed chemist inquired : " Is it possible that the apparent aversion to helium is due to the influence of a German engineer occupying a responsible place in our air service ? America possesses a helium monopoly . It is conceivable that our good fortune is regarded jealously by those who remain loyal to other countries under all circumstances . " <P> Heinan Described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who ( employed by the U. S. Navy Department ) was aboard the Shenandoah on the occasion of its accidental flight . Short , slenderly built , Heinan has a keen and piercing blue eye , an air of imperturbability . Bred in the great German port of Hamburg , he was a seaman before becoming Germany 's most noted dirigible pilot . He flew the Bodensee between Berlin and Friedrichshafen in south Germany on passenger-carrying service with almost clocklike regularity , claims to have carried 100,000 passengers without a single casualty in ten years ' piloting . In spite of his imperfect English , he was able a fortnight ago , tugging the while at his well-trimmed beard , to keep the attention of some 200 men- aeronautical students at New York University , Army and Navy men , and aviation enthusiasts generally-riveted on a lecture of more than two hours ' duration . He has taken out his first papers , intends to make the U. S. his home , foresees here tremendous possibilities in his chosen field . <P> Heinan 's Reply . Heinan made a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission in April . If Great Britain or any other Power threatens to forestall the U. S. in a voyage of discovery to the Polar areas this Summer , the German pilot is prepared to make an immediate dash to the Pole , not by way of Alaska- where mooring masts and other equipment have to be carefully prepared- but in a five-day non-stop flight of 6,000 miles from Lakehurst straight to the Pole and back . And this at 24 hours ' notice . But it would be possible only with the lighter hydrogen gas . " With hydrogen , we could make the trip to the Pole and back easily and safely . With helium it is necessary to have mooring masts , where the ship can be tied up because she could not carry enough fuel for the round trip . "
