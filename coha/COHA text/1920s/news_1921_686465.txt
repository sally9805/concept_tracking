txt Owing to greatly improved transportation conditions in Mexico and better outlook in both the silver and the lead market , American Smelting &; Refining Co. has begun to start up a number of its Mexican properties that were shut down some time ago and to increase output at others which have been kept in operation . It will take several weeks to get operations going smoothly , but by June the company expects again to be making fairly good earnings from its mines and smelters in that country , as operating costs have been greatly reduced in thc last few months south of the harder . Two furnaces will be started up in the next few days at both the Matehuala and the Aguas Calientes smelters . The Chihuahua smelter has been kept in operation , but owing to increased output from neighboring mines output from that plant will also be increased considerably in the next few weeks . The Vete Grande mine has been kept in operation near Parral , but output there will be increased and the Tecolotes mine , one of the smelting company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Santa Barbara . Production will also be resumed at the company 's mines in the Santa Eulalia district near Chihuahua . Discussion of the general policies that the smelting company should adopt in regard to its various American properties is expected to continue well through next week . Whether announcement of the plans in regard to the various properties will be made at the end of the conferences , or whether it will be considered better to wait until the various managers have returned to their respective districts , has not been decided yet . Owing to betterment both in the transportation and in the labor situaiton in Mexico , American mining men are said to be doing considerable skirmishing around after promising properties in the eastern districts of the country . Partly because of this , but mainly because of the steady improvement that is being shown in Mexican conditions generally , American Smelting &; Refining is expecting to derive considerable revenue from its Mexican mines and smelters during the coming year . With a firm hand again in the government of that country , the company feels readjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier in Mexico than here . No change in the tariff situation is expected before two or three , months so far as the metals are concerned , one of the company 's officials said . While it is believed that considerable Spanish lead will have been placed upon this market before then , the company feels the lead situa , tion is intrinsically in such a strong position that the market will not be seriously affected as to prices . It is thought that in the regular tariff bill Congress will see that duties are high enough to keep Eiiropean lead from coming upon this market to the detriment of the American miner and smelter . This dufnping of European , lead upon the American market is a new development as usually European demand is strong enough to absorb the Spanish and Australian outputs without difficulty . Australian output is expected to be very small this year on account of serious injury in January to the main smelter and refinery serving the Broken Hill mines . This should aid greatly in increasing demand for Mexican lead as soon as present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and the general industrial situation in Europe has begun to show substantial improvement .
