From Sofia despatches chronicled the assassination of M. Madjariow , the mayor of the city , by one Tomoff . For a wonder the two men chanced to be of the same political party and as a result the Bulgarian press was unable to adhere to its usual policy of attaching an allegedly " deep political significance " to every notable crime . <P> In this instance the murderer admitted that he killed M. Madjariow for discharging him from a minor municipal post . Moreover , as he was about to be apprehended by the police , he committed suicide - thus putting an end to the possibility of a vendetta being declared by the relatives of the murdered man . <P> Since all opportunities for sensationalism were thus balked , considerable mention was made of the fact that the murdered man was a son of the noted Bulgarian diplomat , M. Michael Madjariow , a pre-War Bulgarian Minister to Russia and to Great Britain . <P> It was recalled that the elder Madjariow had vigorously urged a pro-Ally attitude upon the Bulgarian Government up to the very moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His son rose to political prominence early in life , and was " one of the youngest and most popular majors ever installed at Sofia . "
