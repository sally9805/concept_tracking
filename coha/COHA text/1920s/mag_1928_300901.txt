It was in a barbershop at Memphis , Tenn. , last week . Theodore Gilmore Bilbo . Governor of Mississippi , was being-shaved . In the next chair , Governor Henry H. Horton of Tennessee was being shaved . <P> Said Governor Horton : " How 's politics down your way ? " <P> Governor Bilbo : Oh , soso . Looks pretty easy for Smith . Think he 'll carry the State by 15 to 1 . How about Tennessee ? <P> Horton : You can just bet Tennessee is going to be in the Smith column , too . . . by 25,000 . <P> Bilbo : What 's he going to do nationally ? <P> Horton : Well , I do n't know . What do you think ? <P> Bilbo : I have a hunch he 's going to win . . . . It 's a funny election . For the first time in the history of the country the bootleggers and preachers are lined up on the same side-fighting for Hoover. * <P> <P> Nominee Hoover 's secretary , George Akerson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He protested that Governor Bilbo , if quoted correctly in the press , had made " the most indecent and unworthy statement in the whole of a bitter campaign . " The reported Bilboasm was to the effect that , on one of his Mississippi flood-relief trips , Mr. Hoover had " got off the train at Mound Bayou , Miss. , and paid a call on a colored woman there and later danced with her . " " That statement is unqualifiedly false , " declared Secretary Akerson . " I was with Mr. Hoover every hour of the four months while he was engaged in the flood . " <P> <P> * One George B. Quincy , who described himself as a traveling salesman selling flavor extracts and coloring material to a trade composed 95% of bootleggers in Indiana , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , New York and New England , wrote to the New York Times ( Democratic ) last week and deposed that of 289 inquiries he made among his customers , only seven revealed votes for Nominee Smith . Said Salesman Quincy : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contributed to the Republican National Committee . Seven . . . contributed to the Anti-Saloon League . <P> " In Massachusetts and Rhode Island one of my customers had been delegated to collect funds among the bootleggers which they sent to the Republican National Committee .
