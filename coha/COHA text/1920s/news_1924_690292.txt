txt Comment on this These Marvels week 's proceedAre . ings in St. Paul 's Not Miracles . Chapel might take any one of ? several directions and tones . To doctors and psychologists , of course , there is nothing at all mysterious , and least of all anything miraculous , in either the " cures " that have been effected or in the failures to cure . In writing of the first day 's session , THE TIMES reporter said that " the crowd was highly emotional . The women became hysterical . " The first of these statements was obviously true . The second , however . would have been improved as to correctness had the word " became " been changed to " were , " for from the psychological standpoint the women only manifested in the church a previously existing condition , and the men were hysterics as much as the women , unless they were drawn there merely by curiosity . Hysteria , however , is a malady as real as any other , and the fact that it can be cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery is no reason for regarding it . or its effects as imaginary in the sense of unreal . That in the cases amenable to his treatment Dr. BELL relieves , and sometimes even cures , is to be denied only by those who do not know the various efficacies of suggestion in its several forms , and the regular doctors , instead of jeering at or reprehending the work of men like him , would be better advised if all of them , instead of comparatively few , should seek means and methods for utilizing the same device under other names and , one is tempted to add , more intelligelitly . They , at least , would not use the device where it is inapplicable . and so would not delay proper treatment until it was too late , which is what all of the irregular practitioners of medicine , of whom Dr. . BEI , e , is one , often do . It is a little amusing His Claim to note that Dr. Beer , Made is emphatic in denying by Them AIL that there Is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by M. Cous , the Christian Scientists , the New Thoughters , and in the Emanuel movement . He sincerely believes in the differende , no doubt , and so do his clients . The . fact remains , however , that his successes are in Orel cisely the same field as theirs and are due ; like his failures , to the same reasons . Argument on these matters is quite useless , however , and it might as well be admitted that , for the present at least , men like Dr. BELL can do more . in just the right cases , then can be accomplished by a doctor Whose appeal to faith is much less moving than this . The regular doctor also uses suggestion . consCiously or unconsciously , ' and his fame as a practitioner is dependent almost as much on the degree In which he can inspire confidence as on his knowledge of medicine or surgery . At any rate , the doctor who can not create trust " in his skill might as well give UP practice . A very distinguished surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " admitted that not infrequently they were real and astonishing , but he quietly , added , " I suspect that in most cases the patients , when they went to the ' healer . ' were not as sick as thee ' , thought they were , and when they went away were not as well as they believed . " Rarely is a cure thus effected permanent , but neither does the regular doctor insure against the recurrence of a malady which he has cured  --  does not , that is , except when the disease is among the few that human beings can have only once . Automobilists are goAlready One ing to be deprived of Sees a long-enjoyed and . much-valued privilege Improvement under the new regulations about parking their ears in the streets . The/deprivation is going appreciably to diminish the utility to them , of their cars , and they will not hike that . But they also will gain something from the greater fadility of movement that will result from the lessening- of obstructions in the ' highways . ? Perhaps , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced except for those whose habit it has been to drive to their - offies or places of business in the , morning and ' park their cars near . by all day , so as to have them conveniently placed for the homeward journey . If the new- rules involve a sacrifice for these automobilist. % however , they can or should get consolation from the knowledge that ' the general welfare will be enhanced by clearing the streets nf standing cars ; and as the police promise to enforce the new regulations according to spirit , rather than letter , and not to be too meticulous in measuring twenty . minutes , . the anticipated inconveniences may not be really severe . After a while , too , it is probable that many parking places will be arranged , even in the Wall Street region , foe what is desired is not the persecution of the automobillsts but their regulation .

But there will be wars , bitter and prolonged , as to which of - the two classes this or that notability belongs . Dr. BRILL himself started controversy by the few allotments of his that were reported in yesterday 's papers . He numbered the late THEODORE ; HooszvErir with the " syntonics , " and yet few men were less content with conditions as he found them than was the Colonel , and few fought harder to change them . And why does Dr. Beim think that JAILERS MADISON was a " schizoid " ? A man of parts he was , no doubt , but more dominated than dominant . This is n't the first time that a relation between genius and insanity has been recognized , but any emphasizing of it is a bit irritating except to sternly scientific minds .
