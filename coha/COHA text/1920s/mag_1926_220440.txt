THE TORRENTS OF SPRING-Ernest Hemingway-Scribner 's ( $1.50 ) . It seems that young Mr. Hemingway , who works like a nailer over his own writing , with extraordinarily promising results , was going about his business in Paris , lunching frequently with Scott Fitzgerald , Ford Madox Ford , John Dos Passos and even H. G. Wells , when a copy of Black Laughter by Sherwood Anderson reached him and caused him a bit of a pain . Perhaps other people were similarly affected by that earnest study of a dissatisfied newspaperman who abandoned his wife and wandered around until he got another man 's wife , whose Negro servants laughed to see such sport . If so , here is solace . For with due respect to Critic H. L. ( " Hatrack " ) Mencken and the allegedly significant Chicago school of fiction , young Mr. Hemingway has sat him down and written a not altogether respectful parody of Mr. Anderson 's vein . You can just see all the gay young men of Paris laughing over it at those luncheons .
