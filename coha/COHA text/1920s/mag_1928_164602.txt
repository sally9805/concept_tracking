For the first time since the Cradle of Liberty first rocked , a woman spoke in Faneuil Hall , Boston , on Independence Day . She was U. S. Representative ( Mrs. ) Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts , and during her address the cradle rocked again . As became a good Republican , she praised Herbert Clark Hoover . Then , to the surprise of some Bostonians and the delight of others , she said : " I am going to speak of Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York . He , too , came of the people . . . . America gave him his chance and he grasped it . He has made good use of that chance for the benefit of his State and perhaps he will use it for the benefit of the United States " ( stormy applause ) . <P> Interviewed two days later , Mrs. Rogers said she felt sure Hoover would be elected , called him " greatest American distributer.
