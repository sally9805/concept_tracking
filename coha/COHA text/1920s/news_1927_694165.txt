txt In the Journal of Commerce a federa ' trade commissioner is quoted as saying that Yederal control of the issue of stock by all corporations is " an issue perhaps s necessity . " There is much virtue in that " Perhaps . " The conclusion is based upon the issue of alleged " wildcat " oil propositions promoted in Texas , and orders to " cease and desist " have been issued by the Federal Trade Commission against eight Texas oil promotion schemes .

Those experienced in the practice of bureaus to which Congress delegates some of its power will recognize an old device . - whereby an incompetent bureau , which has never justified its existence and has been continually under the fire of expert criticism , proposes to strengthen itself and conserve its salary list by extending its meddlesome and futile activities into a field which can not possibly concern it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preventing the abuse of the mails , and Texas at least has a blue-sky in law which , in point of scope . extends to the zenith . Wall Street is familiar with that kind of thing .

It is an old political device , when a system is under fire , to lead the hunt away on another scent .
