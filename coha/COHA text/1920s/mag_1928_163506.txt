There was no warrant or written complaint against Frederick Jockell , attorney of Mount Vernon , N. Y. Yet he was arrested in Manhattan on a charge of grand larceny , clapped into jail with " a howling Chinaman . " So , claiming that he had been humiliated , Mr. Jockell sued Detective John J. Quinn ( who arrested him ) for $25,000 . Last week a jury upheld Mr. Jockell to the extent of $1,000 . Presiding Justice Joseph Morschauser of the New York Supreme Court added : " The verdict should have been ten times as much , so as to teach New York police officers to be more careful in making arrests . Whenever I go into the city I do not know whether or not I 'll get out again without being arrested . As a result I take the first train out into the country again that I can . "
