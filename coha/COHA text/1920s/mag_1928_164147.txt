A so-called Doctrine of Ministerial Rotations was invented , at Rome last week , to explain the resignation of Finance Minister Count Giuseppe Volpi ( TIME , July 16 ) and to forestall the panic which threatened to ensue . <P> Rumors of Italian panic were whooped up on the hostile Paris Bourse until even in Manhattan , where so many financiers are notoriously pro-Fascist , quotations on the most impeccably secured Italian bonds moved down as much as 1 points . As uncertainty grew to fear the Italian lira , which Count Volpi placed on a gold basis cf 5.26 last December , sank abruptly to 5.23 , a low record for 1928 . <P> Though such a movement would have seemed trifling before the lira was stabilized on a gold basis , it loomed ominously , last week , almost seven months after complete stabilization was supposed to have been achieved . With Volpi , the master stabilizer out of office , a serious slump might set in . <P> From Paris came a second wave of panic rumors-again with repercussions in Manhattan . Fascist censors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian bankruptcies have risen from 500 per month in 1923 to over 900 per month . Substantial Italian banks with capitalizations of between one and 600 million lira were stated to be going bankrupt at the rate of one such institution every fortnight . Finally bills to a total value of three and a half million lira were declared to have been dishonored during the past twelvemonth in the three provinces of Rome , Milan and Turin . <P> Though such rumors were obviously intended to produce a maximum shock from a minimum content of fact , they made it impossible for Signor Benito Mussolini to continue to pass over in silence the resignation of Finance Minister Count Volpi . The response of Il Duce , obediently voiced by unanimous editorials in the State dominated press , was that Fascist Italy has perfected as a substitute for the cabinet crises of more democratic states the Doctrine of Ministerial Rotations . Stripped of rhetoric , the Doctrine means that , while France gets a new set of Ministers every time her Cabinet falls , the fact that Prime Minister Benito Mussolini 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infusing new blood and brains into the Government . This Signor Mussolini now proposes to do by " rotating " the Ministries among able statesmen-that is , by kicking out of office , from time to time , dignified statesmen who would ordinarily expect to hold their posts until the Prime Minister himself resigned <P> The blood and brains of Il Duce are , of course , assumed to be ceaselessly freshened and renewed , for he personally holds seven Cabinet*- a majority of the total , 13 . <P> Though uneasiness continued as to the ultimate effect of Count Volpi 's retirement , panic rumors were virtually scotched by the ingenious " Doctrine " - which really amounted to assuring the public that Volpi had been sacked by Il Duce and had not resigned because he deemed the fiscal structure of Italy unsound . <P> The new blood and brains which were infused into the Finance Ministry , last week , are those of Senator Antonio Mosconi , aged three score and two , and scion of a noble line whose ancestors began to flourish two centuries before the discovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
