txt // The extent and nature of subsidization in sociology are indi cated in the following quotation from a study by Carter : ss Less than 40 per cent of those making returns received financial assistance specifically for research . . . . Of the 100 in the group receiving assistance , not more than ten or fifteen indicated that the financing was adequate . The bulk of those assisted received a small sum for local travel , for a limited amount of clerical assistance or for other contingencies . There are many scholars who make clear their belief that their work is well-nigh fatally hampered through lack of funds . Unfortunately , Carter 's results do not specify the source of financial assistance . But perhaps the questions raised with re spect to subsidization by foundations would apply , with slight modification , to all types of subsidization as well . 3 . TRENDS Since we have already pointed out a number of trends in sociology , and since this book deals with significant trends in the major fields of the subject , the present discussion will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed presentation . As an Academic Discipline. ? As an academic discipline , soci-ology reveals a number of important tendencies . One of these is the extension of instruction downward in the curriculum . Tol-man , it will be remembered , pointed out in 1902 that at that time one of the major trends was toward the recognition that the postgraduate school of sociology was " the only adequate institu-tion for such study . " And Bernard , in his study of 1909 , found that sociology was still primarily a graduate subject . He ac-counts for this as follows : " The reasons why sociology remains so predominantly a graduate subject in most large institutions are mainly two . In the first place , there is a widespread prejudice against permitting immature minds to think about all kinds of social questions . . . . A further cause is the lack of suitable textHISTORY // hooks and techniques for bringing facts concretely and compre hensively to the young students . As yet we have not enough teachers suitably trained to present the facts that are socially valuable with due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , there has been a notable tendency to introduce sociology in some form or other into high schools and even into grade schools . By 1917 , Freese found that " many secondary schools have introduced courses in elemen tary sociology or social problems into their curricula . " " Be tween 1920 and 1924 , Read Bain found that in the State of Washington , " the number of high schools offering sociology increased more than 90 per cent , while the number of pupils tak ing sociology increased almost 16o per cent . " ss The geography of this movement toward the extension of sociology is interesting . Freese noted that " though most of these new courses in sociology are found in the Central and Western states , many educators in the Eastern and Southern states are heartily in sympathy with the movement . " 100 While Bain 's fig ures are , therefore , not at all representative of the United States as a whole , they nevertheless indicate a trend which is by no means insignificant . In the older and more conservative schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exigencies of the College Entrance Examination Board , we may not expect to find courses in sociology until the colleges themselves recognize it as an entrance subject . Sociology is also extending into more and more institutions of collegiate rank . Practically all of the newer schools make provision for instruction in sociology as such . In the older schools , especially those in the East , the subject matter of soci ology is usually taught under some other name and in various departments . We might in fact mention the tendency toward the // smuggling of sociology into the curriculum under cover of respectable names like Social Biology , Social Ethics , Practical Ethics , and the like , as a sort of sub-tendency . In all events , there is a trend toward the recognition that no college curriculum is complete without some provision for what we ordinarily call sociology . We have already noted the growth of sociology as a graduate subject in our discussion of the importance of the departments at Columbia and Chicago . The data there presented seem to indicate that more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociology . But the case of Columbia should serve as a reminder to sociologists that there is nothing irreversible in this trend . As both cause and consequence of these tendencies , there is a marked improvement in the training of teachers of sociology . Formerly , interest in the subject matter was considered enough to justify a man in undertaking to teach sociology . Thus ministers , ex-ministers , professors of English , of philosophy , of history , of mathematics or of Greek or theology , used to feel equipped to fill chairs of sociology even in larger colleges and universities . Now we require men with specific training in sociology to teach the subject . Although there still are important sociologists who have never had any specific training in sociology , it seems that as sociology develops in complexity , those who can make important contributions to the field without training will tend to decrease and presumably to disappear . This does not imply , of course , that biologists , geographers , historians , and other thinkers will not continue to enrich sociology , but that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other fields will tend increasingly to be trained sociologists . There is another extension of sociology which is not so frequently commented upon , but which is at least as important if not so extensive , as the tendencies already noted . I refer to the extension of sociology into the other sciences , into the professions , and into popular thought . More and more sciences tend to // become " social " sciences . ' " Geography , biology , and psychology are perhaps the most outstanding examples . But even such sub jects as economics and political science have tended to become increasingly sociological . And the Annual Report of the Smith sonian Institution for 1927 even contains a paper on " Paleon tology and Human Relations , " by Stuart Weller . The extension of sociology into the various professions is interesting as a case of the application of sociology . Although we hear a great deal about " applied " sociology in the sense of social problems or social pathology , or even of social work , the most significant application of sociology has perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogues , sociology was usually recommended for those preparing for civil positions , for journalism , for the ministry , for law , or for teaching . This was in recognition of the important bearing which sociology had upon these professions . In recent times this recognition has become intensified , and it seems reasonable that the trend will continue . It is impossible to estimate just what has been the influence of sociology on business , on law , on medicine , on religion , on education , and similar professions . It has probably been dif ferent in kind and in degree in each case . It is at least true that an increasing number of students in universities who are prepar ing for these professions come in contact with sociology . Thus Bossard points out that at the Wharton School of Commerce and Finance , sociology has been an important part of the curriculum for many years.102 The same is unquestionably true of similar schools in other universities . At Harvard , law students have been given a sociological orientation by Dean Roscoe Pound , and his influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the socialization of religion and of education may almost certainly be traced , in part at least , to the influence of sociology in the curricula of schools of education and of theology . The movement toward the socialization of medicine , especially // the public health movement , has also been unquestionably influ enced by sociology . It seems probable that several generations of business men , of lawyers , of doctors , of ministers , of edu cators , of journalists , trained even incidentally in sociology , might have considerable influence on their professions . It is perhaps not yet possible to express a normative judgment as to the value of this influence at the present time . The extension of sociological knowledge into popular thought has had interesting results . With many , the recognition that social controls are products neither of reason nor revelation nor of natural law , that they are highly relative and frequently irra tional , and that they have merely traditional or customary sanc tions , has led to a disavowal of such controls entirely . The further sociological knowledge that social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one set of such controls merely leads to the automatic setting up of another set , frequently equally irrational , has not been generally recognized . And the sociologist 's reply to the condemnation of traditional standards , namely , that they should be replaced by scientifically determined ones , has scarcely extended beyond academic confines.103 In Research. ? Ogg considers the following two trends in re-search in the social sciences as the most noteworthy in the past fifteen or twenty years : " ( I ) the growth of organized co-operative , large-scale research , as contrasted with the individual , isolated , limited , piecemeal investigations of earlier times , and ( 2 ) the drift of research away from the universities . " 104 Of these he says further that " the first gives every sign of continuing indefinitely , very likely with increased momentum and propor tionately heightened effects . The second is still strongly in evi dence , but not so certain of permanence . " More specifically of sociology , however , after pointing out the tendencies toward co-ordination and correlation of research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " sociological research is still in an amorphous condition and lacking proper support . " 10 " The movement toward large-scale , cooperative , organized re-search has , according to Laski , brought with it a trend toward what might be called formalism or ossification in research . He says , " that we are in danger of becoming over-interested in the collection of material for its own sake and under-interested in the problem of the philosophy the material implies . " 100 This is a point which many modern sociologists , in their enthusiasm for research , are likely to dismiss as untrue ; but if so keen an observer as Laski perceives such a tendency , it behooves thought ful students of the subject to give it serious consideration . The problem of method in research has been one of the most important bones of contention among sociologists during the past decade . The publication of Watson 's Behavior in 1914 did not stir sociologists profoundly . A few years later , however , Ellwood wrote an article in reply to one written by a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociology . Zeliony was an ardent behaviorist , and Ellwood 's article was a defense of the older subjective techniques of research . Bernard replied , in turn , to Ellwood 's article in 1919 , defending the objective method . In the meanwhile , Social Process and The Polish Peasant had ap peared , and behaviorism , in defending itself as a method , had be-come a cult . The stage was set for a royal battle and a royal battle ensued . It has assumed various guises and forms and new terminology from time to time , but the essential conflict of viewpoint has manifested itself throughout . The most recent form for this controversy to take is that of a discussion as to the relative merits of the statistical as opposed to the case method of research , or of the behavioristic technique as opposed to that of " sympathetic introspection , " or of analysis of subjective motives . These discussions on method have been illuminating and extremely valuable , if sometimes acrimonious and emotional . // They have forced sociologists to become critical of the logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been all give and no take with most protagonists , in fact each has actually admitted in part the contentions of the other side . The Chicago school still minimizes the value of statistics ? but they have brought an extreme advocate of statistical method into their department . Statisticians may still find much to criticize in case technique  --  but they are working hard to fit it into statistical categories . There is some reason to believe that a reaction against ab stract formulations of method is now setting in . Bernard , 107 Thomas , 108 and Cooley , 109 among others , have pointed out the futility of dogmatic and inflexible rules of method . The burden of their argument is that every research project in science presents its own peculiar problems of method , and that to approach it with a preconceived bias or prejudice in favor of some specific type of method is harmful to the best results . Mention should also be made of the large number of books on method which have appeared in the last decade . Chapin , Bogardus , Schluter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elmer have written or projected such manuals dealing with methods of research . In Subject Matter. ? We have already discussed a number of important trends in the contents of sociology , namely , the elimi nation of " social science , " of philosophy of history , and of biological metaphysics from its subject matter . Another inter esting trend is that toward the reintroduction of geographical factors into sociological theory . A generation ago Turner and his followers stood at Cumberland Pass and watched the succes sion of explorer , pioneer , hunter , farmer , and trader , or of Eng lish , Scotch , Irish , Dutch , and the like , cross the mountains ; and other geographical historians , such as Miss Semple and H. B. George , pointed out the social consequences of natural features // I Ike mountains , passes , and the like in American history.110 At present , the sociologist stands in certain urban districts or re- ; ; ional areas and watches the succession of cultural groups ? native American , German , Scotch , Irish , Pole , Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or what not . He points out the relation to social organization of such physico-social fea tures as railroad tracks , transportation facilities , industrial plants , playgrounds , and similar items . In brief , he is reintroducing on a local scale an appreciation of the fundamental conditioners of social life which were previously applied only on a national and universal scale . This important trend may be traced to a number of sources , and chiefly to four . To the rural sociologists , perhaps , belongs the first recognition of the importance of geographical and spatial re lations for social organization on a community scale . Galpin 's Social Anatomy of a Community was a brilliant contribution to this field , a contribution which the rural sociologists were quick to assimilate . In the field of cultural anthropology also , the dis covery that there were definite " culture areas " gave impetus to the trend toward the recognition of the importance of space units . The social survey , of course , has always recognized local units , and only a slight shift of emphasis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " human ecology . " These three movements were in the air , and it required merely the applica tion of a suggestive name and the personal prestige of Professor Park 's backing to precipitate and formulate this trend definitely . The influence of Simmel , working chiefly through Park and his followers , was the fourth source of the reintroduction of spatial relationships into American sociology . Another interesting trend in the subject matter of sociology is that toward a renewed interest in the concepts and findings of cultural anthropology . For a long time the sociologists took a // more or less negative attitude toward anthropology , finding great satisfaction in pointing out the errors of Spencer and the classical school . To be sure , there were always some sociologists , notably Keller , Giddings , Weatherly , and Thomas , who found the anthropological method valuable ; but the general and widespread interest in anthropology now current in sociological circles is relatively recent . This renewal of interest in cultural phenomena is the result of the recent flowering in anthropology itself . For many years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field studies and shunned any attempts at synthetic and generalized presentation of their results . Thus their discoveries were not available for application to sociology until the beginning of the present decade when a series of brilliant books began to appear which gave to the rest of the world the fruits of two decades of monographic researches . Books by Wissler , Goldenweiser , Lowie , Kroeber , Tozzer , Wallis , to mention only the more outstanding , produced a sort of ferment in sociology which has found expression in a widespread application of anthropological concepts to sociology , especially those pertaining to culture . In fact , " culture " bids well to supersede " society , " and " cultural , " " social , " in the sociologist 's vocabulary . And , incidentally , whatever remnants of a philosophy of history might have remained lurking under cover of " social evolution " have tended to disappear , for the most recent trend is in the direction of discarding the term " evolution " and of speaking simply of " change . " Ellwood finds that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) to stress the importance of the mental side of social life and so the close interdependence of psychology and sociology ; ( 2 ) to overcome " particularism " by an organic synthetic view of the social life ; ( 3 ) to develop a composite method which shall synthesize all minor methods of social research and investigation . " " i He adds a fourth with reservations . " Perhaps we should also add that there is a pronounced in Op. cit. , p. i. // tendency to develop sociology at the present day in the interest of ethical ideals and of social reconstruction . This tendency is , however , not shared by all the sociologists of the day . A minority protests vigorously , not only against ethical sociology , but against any connection of sociology with practical social movements . " 112 The order of interest in sociological subjects as manifested in research projects of 259 sociologists in 1927 and as set forth by Carter are : Social Psychology ( 44 ) , Education ( 30 ) , Religion ? the Church ( 21 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tionality ( 18 ) , Technique of Social Work ( 16 ) , Rural Welfare ( 14 ) , Immigration and Movement of Peoples ( 14 ) , Conditions in Industry ( 14 ) , Criminology ( 13 ) , Population ( 12 ) , General Social Theory ( 11 ) , Economics ( 8 ) , Social Processes ( 7 ) , So cial Institutions ( 5 ) , Anthropological ( 4 ) , Methodological ( 4 ) , and Miscellaneous ( 6 ) .113 From an examination of the titles of graduate theses , and of the contents of the American Journal of Sociology and of Social Forces , Bain found that " interest in Family is declining . . . , Methods of Investigation occupies a low place both in research and in the literature , Institutions ranked first in research in 1920 and 1924 . . . , Social Process ranks second . . . in research and second in the literature , both research and publications show a preponderant and increasing interest in practical subjects . " 114 A more detailed analysis of the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicates some rather interesting features about trends.115 His data point to cyclical recurrences of interest in various phases of sociology . Thus , for example , if one plots the percentage of space devoted to general sociology in the American Journal of Sociology from 1895 to 1927 he finds that two curves appear . They are ex tremely jagged , to be sure , but if they were smoothed , it would be found that one cycle , beginning in 1898 with a minimum of // interest in general sociology , reaches its apex in 1904 and there-after declines until 1912 . Then begins a second upward trend , culminating in 1919 , and a gradual decline since that time . The curve of interest in personality is of a different nature . If it were smoothed , it would resemble a U-shaped curve , with rela tively great interest about 1906 , a fall until 1913 , and then a decided increase in interest until 1925 . The curve of interest in social pathology shows peaks in the years 1900 and 1911 , but the general trend is downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and territorial groups are in 1901 , 1905-06 , and 1922 . A very interesting study in sociology fash ions could be made by applying statistical analyses to these data in detail . One might find correlations or " affinities " between interest in various phases of the subject that would throw con siderable light on the workings of the scientific mind . One trend which has not so far been mentioned is rather in teresting . It will be recalled that in the ' nineties the sociologists were very busy differentiating their field from that of the other social sciences . The sociological movement was centrifugal . In more recent years , however , the very opposite trend seems to be apparent . Books like Barnes ' History and Prospects of the Social Sciences , like Hayes ' Recent Developments in the Social Sciences , and like Ogburn and Goldenweiser 's The Social Sciences and Their Interrelations , indicate a movement toward integration rather than separatism . The Social Science Research Council is another manifestation of this centripetal movement . And finally should be mentioned the noticeable revival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Spen cerian evolution and the philosophy of history went overboard , it became unfashionable to discuss progress , and this tabu lasted almost two decades . Within the past few years , however , with the almost complete annihilation of evolution in its classical formulation in terms of a necessary sequence of stages , there bobs // up once more the long-discarded interest in progress . Books on progress have been written , or are being written , by Weatherly , ' Penney , Hertzler , Folsom , Hart , and Wallis . In some cases this may merely be a concrete manifestation of Ellwood 's fourth trend , quoted above , toward the development of sociology " in the interest . . . of social reconstruction . " In others it is also a theoretical and disinterested examination of the limits and possibilities of scientific method and control . CHAPTER II TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY By Read Bain I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE THIS chapter will discuss briefly some of the outstanding trends in American sociological theory since 1900 . " Theory " is a vague word , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but good and ill usage makes it refer to all kinds of speculative inferences and generalizations derived from sense-experience . Often the sense-experiences giv ing rise to the theories are meager or even non-existent . The " theories " may be spun out of the thin air of imagination and wishful thinking . This is doubtless the origin of the contrast between " theory " and " fact . " How often we hear it ! ? " It may be all right in theory , but it wo n't work in practice " ; " he is only a theorist ; his ideas are too vague to be of any use . " This sounds much like the popular contrast between " science and common sense . " But the true scientist , since Huxley 's time certainly , and possibly since Aristotle , looks upon his method merely as a more logical and accurate way of arriving at generali zations than that employed by common sense . He takes his stand with the man of common sense . No data not observable by the senses are data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often liars , and so he checks , extends , and improves them by instruments and by comparing his own observations and inferences with those of his like-minded fellows . So the conflict between science and common sense is resolved . ' Common sense wins . The same is true of the controversy over " fact and 72 // theory . " Common sense , rightly defined , wins this argument as it wins all others . Theory that is not based upon logical inferences from sense-experience is not sound theory . It must do what it claims to do , viz. , give a logical explanation , or summarization , of sense-experience . If it fails to do this , it does not " work , " and hence is fallacious . It is clear that the generalizations of theory will have to be modified whenever new senseexperience is obtained , whether these data are the result of more accurate , more numerous , or new kinds of observations made possible by new or better instruments . Theory , like all human behavior , must pass the pragmatic test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its function is to give a comprehensive description , or conceptualization , of the sense-experience with which it deals . It is a way of ordering and unifying the vast number of observations of human behavior , of transforming the multiverse into a universe . The validity of these generalizations depends upon accuracy of observation which depends upon logical definition of units and instruments of precision . It is also conditioned by the perception of relations between the defined and classified phenomena . This involves hypotheses , logic , mathematics , experimentation , and that indefinite quality we call synthetic imagination , or creative intelligence . So all theory is relative , tentative , partial , for the senses are fallible even when aided by instruments of precision , the symbols of record are never exact , and the data themselves are all incomplete , inexact , and continually changing . The world itself is a flux . All scientific " facts " are mere generalizations of sense-experience . Therefore , theories derived from " scientific facts " are necessarily marked with the taint of mortality . It is unnecessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most theory is unsound , is too partial to be useful , is too far removed from scientific and common-sense experience to be convincing , is too illogical and vague to stand the acid test of critical analysis and pragmatic sanction . But these strictures have not and will not prevent man from // theorizing . He is the generalizing animal . He has a natural impulse to reflect , abstract and generalize . ' He can not be con-tent until he has " explained , " i.e. , generalized , his behavior . This is the only means he has of injecting order and meaning into the buzzing chaotic confusion of the perceived world ; it is his way of unifying his universe , of adjusting himself to the terri-fying diversity of experience . Theory is also used to mean a verified hypothesis . Probably theorem , law , or principle would be a better term . At any rate , most sociological " theory " is more nearly on the level of con-jecture and valuation than of scientific verification . In the following pages , I shall use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a more intensive and extensive study of human group phenomena than is true of similar common-sense generalizations . I have used " sociological " rather than the more common " social " theory as a logical excuse for ignoring the generalizations of the other social sciences except as they may refer to general group behavior . It must be admitted that much current sociological theory goes little beyond common sense in either the accuracy or critical analysis of the data generalized , or in the logical integration of its generalizations with other scientific knowledge . While science and common sense both depend upon sense-experience for their generalizations , science to a much greater extent relies upon in-strumentally objectified , logically defined , mathematically recorded and manipulated observations . Science can thus perceive and classify a wider range of data much more accurately and for a longer time than is possible for common sense , and the generali-zations of science are correspondingly more comprehensive and accurate . It requires very little comparison of generally accepted ( by sociologists , at least ) sociological theories with common-sense opinions to show conclusively that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematized and verified knowledge which is more accurate , extensive and logically integrated than the layman 's theories . It is often contended that this seems true only because sociologists conceal their " scientific facts " in a wil derness of words which the layman can not understand . It is charged that much so-called sociological knowledge is merely vain verbosity . We may grant some truth to this charge , but the fact remains that many sociological theories expressed in the simplest terms are truly revolutionary revisions of the lay-man 's ideas . For example : " You ca n't change human nature " ; " A man naturally knows what 's right and wrong " ; " Man is a rational being " ; the whole category of instinct myths , race myths , religious myths , ad nauseam ; the fanciful ideas about pre-literate peoples ; almost all exact data about any phase of human be havior . The list could be indefinitely extended . Furthermore , much of the technique of investigating and recording the facts of group life , even when it involves only the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the untrained man . This chapter is limited to the trends in sociological theory in the United States since about 1900 . Two methods were con sidered . The first was to summarize and criticize the more im portant views of the more important men . The other was to deal with such shifts of emphasis and agreements in theory as seem most significant . The first was rejected because of limi tation of space and because practically all of the recent essays have taken this approach . ' // The second was chosen because it made greater brevity pos sible and would enable the writer to discuss certain theories with-out repeating too much of the material found in other chapters of this volume . No attempt will be made to give a comprehensive criticism of the theories of particular men . For this , the reader is referred to the books noted in footnote 3 . My interest is in the theories themselves , together with their background , present status , and probable future . There is no presumption that this is a scientific essay . It is merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cal theories for some years . From the nature of the case , the criticisms and conclusions are largely subjective . Their sole pur pose is to give the curious reader one man 's idea of the main tendencies of present sociological theory in the United States . I have no doubt that many men probably better informed than I will be in sharp disagreement with some of the views herein expressed . Only time can decide who are the better prophets . He who predicts in the absence of definite scientific knowledge gives hostages to fortune . But false prophecies ( and prophets ) are soon destroyed by the inexorable logic of events . So we may proceed with a clear conscience and , I hope , with a clear mind . // By the dawn of the century , sociology had won a distinctive place in popular and academic thought It is not contended that sociology was very scientific . It was long on " principles " and short on facts . The term itself , however , perhaps because of its very vagueness , was becoming familiar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beginning to revise their ma terials and theories in the light of these so-called " sociological 77 principles . " This restatement was largely influenced by the re-forming , uplifting , muckracking , charity-giving activities which characterized the last quarter of the old and the first decade of the new century . This was what sociology connoted to the layman . To most people it still suggests a crusading spirit dedicated to " doing good in general , " coddling the down-and-outer , condemning " things as they are , " promoting " progress , " and prophesying , if not producing , millennial dawn . The soci-ologist is often looked upon both as a visionary and a radical . ' By 1900 , sociology was fairly well established in the colleges , ' hut the above-described idea of sociology was , and still is , for that matter , extremely current in academic circles . When soci-ology teachers do not hold it , many of their colleagues do . How-ever , by 1900 , there were several theoretical points of view that were sufficiently well established to exert considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spencer as applied to social behavior . The evolutionary ethnology of Lubbock , Tyler , and Morgan also tinctured sociological theory . Laissez-faire economics , combined with Darwinian evolution , gave rise to the so-called social Darwinism which threatened to make sociology as dismal as Malthus , Ricardo , and Senior had made economics . These views were perhaps best represented by Sumner of Yale , although all early American writers were more or less influenced by them . The Germanic sociologists , especially Ratzenhofer and Simmel , together with the historical economists , Roscher and Schmoller , and the " sociological " economists , Knies , A. Wagner , and A. Schaffle , and the philosophers of history , Savigny and Eichhorn , were represented by Small of Chicago . ' // Columbia , with Giddings in the chair , was the third important academic center of sociology . It is difficult to assign to him any specific European antecedents , but the fact that he has always stressed the statistical approach would point to a possible influence from Quetelet , Schmoller , and the historical economists . Doubt-less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ence in this direction . His years of journalism gave him a realis tic and hardheaded respect for facts . The genius of Giddings has such a broad sweep that it would be quite erroneous to sup-pose that he was unduly influenced by any single set of factors or groups of men . He has never been in intellectual bondage . ' Ross at Nebraska , seems to have been greatly indebted to von Ihering , Tarde , Durkheim , Le Bon , and other French social and suggestion psychologists . Bristol says he is really an eclectic , ' his greatest contribution being the theory of social control . I think it is safe to say that by his dynamic teaching and readable writing , Ross has probably done more than any other single man in America to familiarize the public with the sociological view-point and to interest students in the study of the subject . It should not be thought that these men were merely propa gators of the ideas of Europeans . All of them have made dis tinctive contributions to sociological theory which are well dis cussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter . I have mentioned what seem to me the four chief academic seats of sociology in the United States about 1900 . Columbia and Chicago were by far the most important because they began very early to do graduate work in sociology . Probably eighty or ninety per cent of the " leading sociologists " of today studied at these two schools . Another influence , although non-academic , the importance of // which it would be difficult to over-estimate , was the work of Lester F. Ward . By 1900 , most American and many European scholars were familiar with Dynamic Sociology ( 1883 ) , and Psychic Factors in Civilization ( 1893 ) . His work was a synthesis of Comte , Spencer , and Darwin , interpreted from the viewpoint of a frontier egalitarian . He struck at the narrow individualism of Spencer by emphasizing the socializing and talentreleasing power of education . He glorified the capacity of the common man ; he pointed out the fallacies of laissez-faire economics , and presented a brief for governmental regulation of private enterprise and the extension of governmental services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semimystical worship of humanity into a kind of " materialistic idealism " in which man is only an incident in cosmic evolution ; he transformed the pessimism of social Darwinism into an optimistic , if somewhat esoteric , intellectualism . He believed that by utilizing the principle of creative synthesis , the sociological application of which is individual and social telesis , man could win his own salvation . He faced the universe as the pioneers faced the frontier , and he had a profound faith that man would be able to solve his social problems by his scientifically guided intelligence as the pioneer solved his survival problems by common sense and hard work . It is probable that the reform wing in American sociology was greatly strengthened by Ward 's doctrines of education and social telesis . Although he specifically warned against the evils of hasty and ill-advised reform , this admonition is a minor chord in his symphony of active material and spiritual adaptation ( Bristol 's phrase ) .9 He was much more certain that his " principles " were adequate bases for reform than modern sociologists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " rational being . " His " scientific principles " were largely a priori philosophic deductions . He did not demand factual social data as we do , nor did ' Dynamic Sociology , vol. i , p. i8 , " The reform demanded must come through knowledge " ; vol. ii , p. 447 , " Reforms based upon prohibition are mostly inoperative . " Also in Psychic Factors , pp. 283 if . // he devise any technique for getting them . His intellectualism largely vitiated his theory , as was the case with Spencer , Comte , and all the rest of the armchair theorists . His doctrine of desire and will was a powerful influence on theories of " social forces , " to be discussed later . His terminology was largely that of zoology , botany , chemistry , and physics , the net result of which was to give an analogical conception of social phenomena from which we have not yet recovered . This is one of the important reasons that sociology is often charged with being a bastard science or parasitic discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is an inevitable re sult of a monistic materialism and its consequent " explanation from below , " to which reference will be made later . This , then , is a brief sketch of the status of sociological theory in the United States at about 1900 : the reform movement , the Spencerian-Darwinian evolutionary doctrines , the ethnological application of them , economic determinism , the German philos ophers of history and historical economists , the French School of Comte , Tarde , Durkheim , Le Bon , the statistical approach of Quetelet , and , finally , the remarkable synthesis of these ( and other ) influences by Ward . III . RUBBISH BURNT AND BURNING It has often been remarked that one of the greatest faults of sociological theory , as of all science in its early stages , is its over-simplification , premature generalization or , as Cooley calls it , particularism.10 This means the postulation of single , funda mental , all-inclusive " causes " to account for all kinds of social phenomena . The examples of Spencer and his general theory of evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward and desire , Durkheim and collective representations , Hunt ington and climate , Giddings and gregarity , Ammon-Lapouge , // et al. , and race , Graebner and diffusion , Kidd and religion , Hegel and the state , and many others come readily to mind . The find ings of actual research in all fields soon knocked the props from under most of this armchair theorizing . In America , the an thropologists , led by Boas and ably aided by his students , have perhaps done more than any other group to modify these views , particularly that of Spencerian chronological , unilateral social evolution . It is strange that Spencer fell into the very error his principle of multiple effects should have prevented . ' 1 Although proceeding from a very different source , viz. , the observation of the development in children of human nature as opposed to original nature , Cooley 's organic concept of society was one of the most important influences in saving American sociologists from the fallacy of particularism . As early as 1902 , in Human Nature and the Social Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not exist as mutually exclusive social facts " ( p. 92 ) . The first four chapters are chiefly an elaboration of this thesis . Although I can not find a definite statement of the organic theory in this first book , it was expressed in 1903 when Cooley discussed Giddings ' " Theory of Social Causation . " 12 The suggestion for Cooley 's idea was probably suggested by the work of James Mark I aldwin and William James , as he states on page 90 of Human Nature . Professor Ellwood regards the publication of Social Organi zation , 1909 , as a very significant event in American sociological theory . He places great stress upon the concept of primary and // secondary groups and the process of communication.19 Prob ably most sociologists consider this as Cooley 's major contribu tion ; but he himself and , I think , correctly , regards the " organic theory " as far more important . It is one of the outstanding characteristics of American sociological theory that single-factor explanations have never been very popular . Cooley is merely the symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various fields which brought out the multiplicity of factors , the rapidity of communi cation , with consequent criticism , have been instrumental in preventing this , as well as in preventing the crystallization of sociological " schools . " We have never had anything in Ameri can sociology comparable to the schools of Le Play , Ammon-La pouge , Durkheim , Tarde , Spencer , or Ratzenhofer-Gumplowicz . Giddings has sometimes been cited as an example of the particularistic fallacy in connection with his concept of con sciousness of kind . But one has only to read the record to see that this concept bears no such dominant relation to the rest of his thinking as imitation does to Tarde 's , race to Ammon 's , class struggle to Marx 's , family to Le Play 's , or collective repre sentations to Durkheim 's . This is especially evident in his Studies in the Theory of Human Society , especially in the chap-ters on " A Theory of History , " " Order and Possibility , " " A Theory of Social Causation , " " Pluralistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Further Inquiries of Sociology . " The final statement , " If I can be said to have a system , " with its emphasis on stimulus-response , singularistic and pluralistic ; gregariousness ; social pressure ; collective behavior ; individual differences and division of labor ; selection and perpetuation of the adequate ; together with the thirty " inquiries , " ought to still forever the charge that Giddings put all his theoretical eggs in the gregarity basket . Similarly , the " interests " of Small , the " wishes " of Thomas , and the " primary groups and ideals " of Cooley seem to have // been taken much more seriously and treated much more par ticularistically by some of their students than by these men them-selves . All three would probably name something else as their major ideas . I suspect they would agree that all particularistic , " fundamental , " and " final " theories are likely to be false . They would probably agree that all social processes are pluralistic and that all formulations of them are tentative and incomplete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned much theological and other rubbish and did it extremely well . " 14 We may safely say that the American sociologists ( and an thropologists ) have done the same for a great deal of particu laristic , metaphysical , pseudo-scientific , reformitarian , ethico religious trash . Some of the ideas that have been criticized and minimized are : The " soul of humanity , " social consciousness , social mind , " spirits " of races and cultures , and almost all other metaphysical concepts of society ; unilateral , chronological , me chanistic social evolution ; geographic , economic , ethnic , religious , and all other determinisms ; social Darwinism ; Austinian. sov ereignty and Hegelian-Treitschkeian stateism ; sociology as the basic or cap-sheaf science , in the Comtean sense ; imitation , in stinct , " social instinct , " suggestion , gregarity , prolonged infancy , recapitulation , " social forces , " biological heredity , and all other single factor " explanations " of societal phenomena ; reformism , Utopianism , Christian sociology and socialism ( 57 varieties ) , Creat-man-ism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations of social change . The list might be almost in-definitely expanded . Space prohibits discussion of all these views , but my impression is that most of them and similar ones are " rubbish that has been raked up and burned " by American sociologists and their fellow social scientists at home and abroad . I do not want to appear to claim undue credit for American scholars in this yard-cleaning , but I think it is characteristic of American sociology , at least , that it has not been particularis84 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY tic , but has been , since 1900 , increasingly critical of all simple and nonfactual " explanations . " However , this should not be taken to mean that many of these views are not still being propagated by people who call themselves sociologists and who are called " eminent " on the book-blurbs . There are still racialists , reformists , imitationists , instinctivists , religionists , and all the other - ists , but the vast majority of the sociologists in prominent academic positions would accept very few of these ideas without sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably admit partial validity to many of these views ; but this partiality is an expression of the " organic view " which I have contended is characteristic of American sociological theory . A sociological " fact " is observable only when some defined unit , influenced by all antecedent and coexistent factors , is made the center of attention . This is a kind of sociological " Gestalt " and is not incompatible with the sociological behaviorism which is now developing.15 I shall select three of four general concepts from the above list for brief discussion . This will serve two purposes : ( 1 ) Show how some of them have been more or less reduced to rubbish , and are either burnt or burning ; ( 2 ) Prepare for the statement of some of the more significant ( to the writer ) trends in Ameri can sociological theory . Most of the theories mentioned are still in the stage of destructive criticism . The factual data to verify or refute them are as yet largely lacking or are inconclusive . Hence , the logical analysis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends in theory , since the research hypotheses are generally posited on the doubt of the validity of the old state ments . These are usually questioned as being too general and inTRENDS // accurate , only partially true , or wholly false . The other chapters in this volume furnish many examples of this point of view . I. BIOLOGICAL DOGMAS The nineteenth century witnessed many revolutionary discov eries in biology . Some of these were hastily and uncritically ap plied to social phenomena and resulted in much sociological theory which has not stood the acid test of critical analysis and research . Some of the more important of these biological theories were the doctrine of evolution , especially the natural selection ideas of Darwin , the non-inheritance of acquired characters ( Weissmann ) , the laws of heredity ( Galton and Pearson and , later , Mendel ) , and the instinct explanation of animal behavior . These ideas , often based upon a monistic philosophy of mechanical materialism , were quickly imported into sociological theory and became dogmas from which we are now just beginning to escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the modification of the biological theories themselves , and second , by the intensive study of human , i.e. , cultural behavior . Biologists themselves are far less prone than many sociologists to accept uncritically the theories and implications of ninteenth century biology . It is obvious at once that natural selection through struggle for survival is not a sufficient explanation of organic evolution . Kropotkin 's concept of mutual aid , or co-operation , is now generally admitted . " Nature red in tooth and claw , " which so shocked mid-Victorian sensibility , has been replaced by a nature which not only fosters both conscious and unconscious cooperation , but also supplies instances of self-de struction for the benefit of others . " Likewise , the Spencerian formula of " survival of the fittest " ( which Darwin mentioned only once or twice , if at all , and certainly did not emphasize ) was rapidly attenuated into " survival of the survivors , " with no // ethical , or value , import , whatsoever . This was a deadly blow to the Spencerian theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . The theory of inheritance of acquired characters also soon suffered blows from which it has not recovered . Spencer took the position in the famous controversy with Weissmann that there could be no evolution without it . While Darwin 's theory of evolution was not dependent upon inheritance of acquired characters , his theory of pangenesis offered at once the possibility of it , and also an explanation of variation . The work of Mendel , Galton , Pearson , and Weissmann established the negation of the theory . It is now a generally accepted dogma that acquired characters are not specifically inherited . However , there is some evidence showing that acquired characters may exert a non-specific influence upon offspring . This has been called Neo-Lamarckianism . The whole question has been reopened by the recent discoveries in endocrinology and organic plasticity mentioned below . While it is true that most biologists agree that organic evolution and natural selection are facts , there is also almost universal agreement that all the processes of the former are not satisfactorily explained by the latter . Natural selection became a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it did not explain the development of certain organs to the point where they became significant for survival has never been satisfactorily answered . Other theories , such as orthogenesis , heterogenesis , modified Lamarckianism , and mutual aid , have their adherents , and there are numerous phenomena which are better accounted for by these theories than by natural selection . It must be borne in mind , however , that natural selection operates as a negative factor in all theories of evolution . Whenever an organism from whatever complex of causes becomes sufficiently maladjusted to its environment , natural selection cuts it off . It is the great eliminator and fixer of organic types . It does not explain why certain forms continue to develop in unadaptive directions , nor why variations occur , but it does explain why orTRENDS // ganic types are selected for extinction or survival . Neither orthogenesis nor heterogenesis explains the puzzle of variation . ( ) rthogenesis points out that some forms develop in a persistently tuiadaptive manner , even to extinction ; but it does not explain why this should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of entelechies and " bathmic urges . " I shall mention only three other discoveries which have done much to modify the nineteenth-century biological dogmas , and then proceed to discuss some sociological theories that have been largely based upon the former and modified by the latter . These , with the concept of culture , are largely the means by which sociological theory is emancipating itself from biological dogmas . The first in time , and perhaps also in importance thus far , was Pavlov 's discovery of the conditioned response , or conditioned reflex , about 1900 . This has done more to explain impulsive , compulsive , and automatic behavior without recourse to instincts than perhaps any other one thing . Particularly is this true of hu man behavior , because of prolonged infancy , organic plasticity and unspecificity in the nervous system , especially in the cerebral cortex . A great deal of the responses to suggestion stimuli , and other forms of " unconscious " human behavior , are readily ex plainable in terms of conditioned responses . The remarkable ac-cumulation of cultural material stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human conditioning almost unbelievably ex tensive . This has done much to modify the old instinctivist ex planations and to shift the emphasis from human heredity to socialization . Watson and his followers have applied Pavlov 's discovery to human behavior experimentally with astonishing re sults.17 The second epoch-making event was the discovery of the importance of the endocrine glands in the development and func tioning of organisms . Until recently , very little was known about the ductless glands . They were variously regarded as vestigial // remains or anatomical trivia , functionless or even harmful . The principal organs of this group in men are the pituitary body , the thymus , thyroid and parathyroid , supradrenal capsules of the kidneys , and the interstitial glands of the gonads . Many baffling problems have been partially solved in the last twenty years by the developing science of endocrinology . All reputable students agree that we have , as yet , very little scientific knowledge about the ductless glands , but enough is known to warrant the belief that endocrinology will revolutionize many of our old biological ideas . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimately connected with the balanced growth of the body . Giantism , dwarfism , adiposity , and meta bolic processes , including muscle-toms , are apparently partially controlled by it . Cretinism , formerly regarded as hereditary , or endemic , regulation of pigmentation and hair growth , and pos sibly regulation of the cardio-vascular system are attributed to the thyroids and parathyroids . Fear and rage , and other emo tional behavior , especially the regulation of the tonicity of the unstriped muscles and the functioning of the sympathetic nervous system , are closely correlated with the adrenals . From much ex perimental evidence , it is now well known that the secondary sex characters are largely determined by hormones of the interstitial glands . The above remarks should not be taken to imply that these are specific relations . It is probable that the endocrine glands comprise a nicely balanced and functionally integrated system so that malfunctioning of one may derange the action of all the rest.18 The association of endocrine disturbances with emotional and temperamental behavior and the relation they bear to organic growth and functioning have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of the relation of the organism to its environment , particularly from // the dietary standpoint , ( cf. absence of iodine in thyroid imbalance , vitamines in nutrition , and possibly a close relationship between certain vitamines and endocrine balance ) , the question of function and structure , and the general modifiability of the organism . In the presence of the evidence from castration , sex reversal , and gonadic grafts , etc. , in modifying secondary sex characters , it is evident that a doctrinaire statement of the germplasm specificity of sex determination is doubtful . Likewise , the end-product of development is obviously a complex of hereditary and other functional and environmental factors . This leads to the third new biological concept I have chosen for discussion . It may be called , following Hankins , the theory of " organic plasticity . " By this is meant the possibility of a variety of structural forms being developed from the same germplasm constituents . The recognition of this fact is , and has long been , widespread among biologists . Identical twins , or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults under extremes of nurture . Offspring of these adults , with reversed environments , will regain the original ancestral characteristics . It would seem the germ plasm is relatively stable , but , so far as actual development is concerned , there is a kind of biological elasticity . There are limits to this elasticity , of course . It varies as between species as well as between the members of a species . This concept tends to diminish the specificity of heredity , and to cast serious doubts upon many of the conclusions of the protagonist of " nature " as against " nurture . " In the most general terms , an organism has certain limits of biological elasticity , or organic plasticity , beyond which environmental factors can not go ; but within those limits , anything is possible . In the case of human beings , it is clear that the general somatic types are fairly well determined by heredity . Disease , glandular imbalance , trauma , occupation , malnutrition , weather influences , etc. , may modify height , weight , coloration , energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the whole , the limits are narrow . The somatic characters are fairly fixed and unalterable . // In the case of neuro-muscular responses , however , the range of plasticity is very great . If the cerebrum is not a complete tabula rasa , it is at least very unspecialized , so that tremendous differ ences in the acquisition of conditioned responses and cultural patterns are possible . Since by definition , these latter are pecu liarly human , we may say that human nature is almost entirely indeterminate . Of course , everyone will grant that there are vast differences in the neuro-muscular plasticity of various men ; but when we find a man who is by general consent a " sow 's ear , " we can not be sure that he was not a potential silk purse . He may be a hothouse primula , white-flowered and white-livered ; whereas an outdoor culture might have made him a vigorous , red-flowered , self-reliant individual . An eminent American neurologist re cently said , " Brains do not grow old . " is It is probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctrines of conditioned responses , endocri nology , neo-Lamarckianism , and the other modifications of the mechanistic biology referred to above . It is a kind of synthesis of all the factors that has tended to release sociological theory from the apron strings of biology . As biology and sociology have become more mature they have both become less doctrinaire . Perhaps no man has done more to emphasize the organic rela tion of " nature and nurture , " " structure and function , " " environ ment and heredity , " than Charles Manning Child . His work of the past twenty years , summarized in Physiological Foundations of Behavior , 1924 , impresses the writer as a revolutionary con tribution to biological theory on a par with that of Darwin , Men-del , Weissmann , Pavlov , and the endocrinologists . The old controversy , " heredity versus environment , " seems destined to go the way of the " individual versus society " concept , i.e. , to be fused into an organic concept . Separation may be made for the purpose of intensive study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more or less arbitrary and fictional . The kinds of behavior patterns ( structure-function relations ) that are more // stable , stereotyped , and have narrower limits of biological elas ticity , will probably be called " hereditary . " The ones that are less so will be called non-hereditary . Thus , heredity-plasticity distinc tions will be made on the basis of differences of degree rather than of kind in explaining the total development-adjustment behavior.2o The reader may wonder what this biological excursion has to do with sociological theory . In the first place , perhaps the major part of sociological rubbish has been implicitly or explic itly postulated on primitive , false , or inadequate biology , ana logically interpreted . Secondly , this discussion of the biological background and recent developments in this field will make clear the theoretical bases of the trends in bio-sociological theory . It will also simplify and shorten the discussion of the five aspects of the problem I have chosen . These are : ( I ) Hereditarianism , ( 2 ) uncritical instinctivism , ( 3 ) race mythology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysgenicism . I have ignored organismic theories of society , the concept of social mind as an entity , and social Darwinism , as rubbish already pretty well destroyed . Needless to say , there is an enor mous literature on these subjects 21 which is still being elaborated , although without any startling additions to the older views . // We have already disposed of the heredity versus environment doctrines by pointing out the intimate organic relationship between the two concepts . There is little disposition on the part of most sociologists to take such an extreme anti-heredity view as they are sometimes accused of doing . However , they are very generally agreed , as the later discussion will show , that hereditarian explanations of human behavior generally ignore cultural conditioning and so are far too simple to be convincing . Lundberg contends that the popularity of hereditarian explanations is based primarily upon the penchant of most people to engage in wishful thinking and thus to escape individual and social responsibility . If a man finds himself in a position of power and prestige , he can justify any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If , on the other hand , a man is a failure , he can conveniently blame his ancestors . It results in a type of mind which tends to applaud and preserve the status quo . It " explains " everything and hence explains nothing.22 Furthermore , if the hereditarian doctrines based upon Weissmannian theory are really sound , the result is inevitably a mechanistic view of human behavior . Choice and intelligence count for nothing . Pragmatically , this is contrary to human experience . So the sociologists generally hold that while heredity fixes practical limits of adjustment , within the range of what I have called " biological elasticity , " heredity does not determine culture . The environment is much more easily manipulated than the genes , and the cultural accumulation , due to the hereditarily unspecialized mechanisms of men , is a fruitful field for such modification . Leaving this , we are upon much more concrete ground in reTRENDS // viewing the sociological criticisms of instinct , the most powerful of the genii in the magic cabinet of the hereditarians . The reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III of this volume . The literature is enormous , so I have given only a few references to serve the double purpose of guiding the inter ested reader , and presenting what I regard as the trends of sociological theory in this field . " The triumphs of nineteenth-century biology are probably re sponsible for the dominant role of instincts in sociological theory . Man and culture were both treated as phases of the evolutionary process . Instincts were thought of as mechanisms laid down in organisms by natural selection and were thus responsible for the social behavior of men . The embryological evidence that " ontogeny repeats phylogeny " was introduced from Germany by Stanley I-Iall as a psycho-social principle . It is practically ex tinct at present , except as it survives in the semi-mystical arche type doctrine of Jung . The instinct theory " explains " everything , and hence has wide vogue , except for those critical persons who demand a rigid definition of the term and then insist that the behavior " ex plained " by it must not contradict the definition . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal in the species , unlearned , relatively unmodifiable , and always appears upon the presentation of a definite type of stimuli , " we find that very little human behavior can be said to be instinctive . However , there are numerous animal behavior-patterns of men which con-form very closely to this definition , e. g. , such responses are grasp ing , suckling , eye-winking , yawning , pupillary adjustments to // light , and a great many vegetative processes . But even these responses are much more modifiable and subject to conditioning than was formerly believed to be true . If we take such instinctive responses as those of fear , rage , and love described by Watson as characteristic of unconditioned infants , we find that all of them can be reconditioned in a most bewildering fashion . While the motor response pattern remains much the same , the types of stimuli producing the characteristic responses are widely variable . For instance , infantile rage may be produced by inhibiting freedom of movement . Cannon has shown that the motor response is largely concerned with the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heightens heart action , increases muscle-tonus , and prepares the organism for dynamic action . But adult rage may be produced by innumerable situations , symbolic or overt , and the response may be observable only through verbal or gestural signs of a very subtle sort . However , the general pattern remains much the same . The type-stimulus is one that interferes with the free functioning of the person as he conceives his role , and the type-response is a heightened energy potential which may enable him to remove the obstacle . The same sort of analysis might be applied to fear , love ( sex ) , food , ego , " self-abasement , " and all so-called complex-instinctive behavior . It is obvious that the socially acquired conditionings , rather than inherited action-patterns , are the significant factors in these responses when we are attempting to understand human behavior . It is our conception of our own role and the roles of others , dependent upon our past experiences , that determines whether our response to a given social stimulus will be rage , fear , affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cause me to desire to punish the slapper , save his soul , flee from his presence , caress him ( if I am a masochistic female ) , or perhaps to study him . To explain my social adjustment on the basis of instinct is meaningless . However , in the case cited , no matter what my human response may be , I will probably wink my eyes , // draw in my breath , and tense my muscles . These are instinctive responses . There are certain general biological sets which are extremely significant as conditioning factors in human behavior . Among these are sex , food , and manipulation of objects and ideas ( curiosity-reflection ) . To these some would add such behavior as ego-satisfaction , ( will-to-power , domination ) , herd " instinct " ( conformity , gregarity , imitation , subordination , and so on ) , and many others , such as interests ( Small ) , wishes ( Thomas-Znaniecki ) , prepotent reflexes ( Allport ) , the eight or fifteen " in stincts " of McDougall , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be classified under these rubrics are so variable and different that sociologists are well agreed that such statements do not " explain " but rather formulate problems for investigation . Whether a particular adjustment act shall be ascribed to one or another " instinct " depends to a great extent upon the classifier . These too general terms invite subjective , unscientific particularism . This seems to be the implication of Faris ' brilliant article , " Are Instincts Data or Hypotheses ? " 24 We may justly speak of various types of social behavior which depend upon sex , food , or manipulative innate dispositions , but the fact that men have these organic predispositions gives us but little clue to the behavior that actually transpires . We have to study the cultural setting and base our predictions upon that . The concept of instinct gives us little aid , if any . We are driven by sex , food , and other vegetative requirements ; but within the limits of organic plas ticity and cultural accumulation , any and all kinds of adjustment behavior may occur . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all that remains of the biological concept of instinct , so far as human behavior is concerned . For scientific sociological research , social patterning is much more sig nificant than the old idea of specific stimulus-response instincts . Even the so-called " hormic drives " ( Woodworth-Young , in // Young 's chapter cited , pp. 147-151 ) , when made equivalent to behavior mechanisms , largely eliminate the specificity of in stincts . A conditioned response is as much a " drive " as infantile rage . The third type of disappearing biological dogmas is that con cerned with race . Having its origin , perhaps , in the philological researches of Max Miiller and his followers , it was developed scientifically by the anthropometric work of Ammon-Lapouge . It is still with us in the Nordic myths of Stoddard , McDougall , Brigham , et at . Since W. I. Thomas ' essay on " The Psychology of Race Prejudice , " sociologists have taken very little stock in the doctrine of instinctive racial antagonism.25 In the first place , ethnology has shown us conclusively that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still going on apace wherever " races " are in contact ; that even when mental differences are revealed by the tests , the overlapping is very great ; that individual differences , both mental and physical , are much greater within " races " than between them ; that " race " prejudice is really due to cultural differences ; that the role of dominance between races has shifted often in the past and very probably will do so in the future ; that statements of superiority are much more easily made than demonstrated . Each cultural group , whether correlated with race or not , tends to regard itself as superior to all others . It is not to be inferred that sociologists contend that there are no " differences " between " ethnic " stocks , but just what the significance of these may be when and if clearly demonstrated , is a big and open question . It is safe to say that most American sociologists place little importance upon the race factor as such in their attempts to study human behavior . Race " problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached scientifically . Race itself is largely a classificatory term rather than a biological datum , and is no more satisfactory at present than instinct con cepts as a basis for generalizing human behavior . The literature // on the subject is enormous . The interested reader is referred to the books below . " By rampant mental testers , I mean those who regard intelli gence as a unitary , hereditary , biological trait and who hold that the I. Q. , or other measure of it , is relatively stationary . Often the tester believes he can tell just what the subject is capable of doing , what he ought to do , or what should be done with him . It is true that most students of mental testing hold no such views , but the prevalence of similar ideas can not be doubted if one is at all familiar with the literature of invidious comparison between immigrant groups , races , families and individuals . Many teach ers and social workers place great reliance on mental tests . There is no disposition on the part of sociologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplore the particularis tic school of testers who are inclined to make a magical ritual out of it . Sociologists grant the usefulness of the tests as a means of classifying various types , both mental , and perhaps eventually , temperamental , but they deny the unitary , hereditary nature of intelligence . This view does not run counter to the fact of individual differences , but it does contend that culture is a tre mendously important factor in determining intelligence scores . In most general intelligence tests , the emotional factors , per sonality traits , and other socially acquired behavior-patterns are blithely ignored . The language factor plays a predominant part in most tests , but even the so-called " performance tests , " while not so heavily weighted by cultural factors , are also influenced thereby . Murchison has shown conclusively that intelligence scores are not at all correlated with adequate social adjustment in criminals , and Lippmann has given a sound sociological criti cism of the whole problem.27 // It is not quite correct to speak of mental testing as " rubbish burnt or burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment responses of persons , which is exceedingly useful for diagnostic and classifying purposes , and will doubtless become much more valuable . But the sociologist insists that the tests measure personality traits , i. e. , the whole complex of innate and culturally acquired differences . He deplores only the particularistic biological and hereditarian interpretations of the tests . He does not deny that certain occupations , religions , ethnic groups , etc. , are different and probably selective as measured by the tests , but he does deny that any sweeping generalizations as to superiority and innate capacity are warranted by such findings . He insists that testers should speak of " intelligences " rather than " intelligence , " and that social as well as biological heredity should be given due interpretative weight . The final biological dogma I have called dysgenicism . By this I mean those views which hold that cultural elaborations are often counter-selective and threaten the welfare , if not the existence , of mankind . The particular phobias that exercise the imagination of these men are almost all dependent upon the hereditary views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuational points of view which are merely matters of opinion and taste . I shall mention a few of the outstanding cries of " Wolf ! Wolf ! " with a minimum of discussion . The implications of the foregoing pages suggest the negative arguments that might be given . In most cases , we have a paucity of verified scientific facts , and if we had the facts , it is not at all clear what generalizations regarding the " future of the race " would be warranted . Nor is it correct to say that these dogmas are " rubbish burnt and burning . " A great many eminent sociologists subscribe to some of them , usually with reservations , however . // Some of these are : the " menace of the moron , " the increase of crime and mental diseases , differential birth rates , the revolt of the under-man , the physical degeneration produced by modern medicine , sedentary life , drugs and improper food habits , race mixture , counter-selection from war , race suicide , and many others closely allied to these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more common to our civilization than to previous ones . In fact , the reasonable inference is that there is nothing new or startling about any of them . Of course it is quite probable that mankind will some day disappear , that our civilization will " fall , " as others have done ; but it is also quite probable that our knowledges and techniques may preserve us for a longer time than we might enjoy in their absence . Most of the pessimism is probably due to our increasing knowledge of these phenomena . Crimes " increase " when we define new acts as crimes . " Crime waves " are largely mythical . Mental defect and disease also " increase " as our definitions , techniques for detecting , and institutions for caring , improve . The moron , imbecile , and idiot , have less chance of being a social menace now than at any time in the history of the world . They have always tended to biological extinction and to this we have added sociological elimination . It is probably now more difficult than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social adjustments necessary for maximum propagation . All peoples in all places have had differential birth rates , birth control , miscegenation , and war . It may be that the rising tide of opposition to war has resulted partially from an elimination of the warlike and because we have developed new and more effective techniques of getting power and pelf . As for physical degeneration , comparative data are lacking , but such as we have would indicate that modern men are at least the physical equals of ancient men . There is no conclusive evidence that high death fates , especially infant rates , are dysgenically selective . All peoples have used drugs . If our life is sedentary , it is also true that we have developed a compensating mechanism in our recrea100 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY tional facilities . Our food habits are probably more rational than those of any previous people . There is no evidence that differen tial birth rates are dysgenic , and it is a well-known fact that they tend to equalize as standards of living approximate one another . This is mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysgenicists are largely doctrinaire eugenicists , rampant mental testers , extreme hereditarians and other biological particularists . I believe most sociologists would agree that we have more reason for optimism than for pessimism.23 2 . THE SOCIAL FORCES ERROR Sociologists formerly gave a great deal of attention to the " forces " that produce societal phenomena . This was probably a direct inheritance of Spencer 's idea of Force , which was derived from the physicists . The idea of " causes " and " forces " is closely allied . Physicists , chemists , and biologists departed from this way of reasoning long before the sociologists , if we have yet done so . The " force " of gravity is little more than a figure of speech with physicists . Most scientists are content to look for relatively uniform repetitive phenomena and to waive the question of cause and force.20 But many sociologists are still looking for them . In 1904 , Ross said , " The cornerstone of sociology must be a sound doc trine of the social forces , " 30 and Small , in 1907 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societary forces is the ultimate process of pure sociology ! ' " One man , at least , dis agreed . E. C. Hayes denied the social forces method of explainTRENDS // ing social phenomena . He contended that " sociology has nothing to do with any social force any more than biology has to do with a vital force . " He held that sociological explanation merely in volved the statement of " regular relation between recurrent phe nomena , ( the study ) of prevalent modes of human behavior. " 32 In his " The Social Forces ' Error , " he elaborated these views , paying especial attention to Ward 's idea of social forces . Hayes says he had expressed this view as early as 1904.33 The whole doctrine of social instincts , wishes , interests , de-sires , hormic drives , attitudes , influence of great men , and so on , is fraught with this concept of more or less definite , isolated , atomistic motives . It leads to what I have elsewhere called the " fallacy of explanation from below , " i. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to biological , chemical , physical , and finally , to metaphysical principles.34 John Dewey has stated this view in an excellent manner : " The only thing which imports obscurity and mystery into the influence of association upon what individual persons want and act for is the effort to discover alleged , special , original , society-making causal forces , whether instincts , fiats of will , personal , or an immanent , universal , practi cal reason , or an indwelling , metaphysical , social essence and nature . These things do not explain , for they are more myster ious than are the facts they are evoked to account for . " 35 So we may sum up the trend with reference to social forces by saying that modern students are inclined to ignore the older views . They are concerned with observation and generalization of clearly defined human behavior and are satisfied if relatively stable uniformities can be found . Such generalizations consti tute the only " explanations " with which they deal . They are // factual , not philosophical . They assume an innumerable host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these may be observed and generalized ; but that is always another problem . These separate uniformities may be integrated by in ference and synthesis , but sociological generalizations tend in creasingly to be kept on the same factual level , i. e. , the observable responses of persons in social situations . The cosmic sweep so characteristic of earlier theory is conspicuously lacking today . Hayes ' paper was a clear statement of what might be called behavioristic sociology and , in my opinion , is one of the major methodological contributions to sociological theory since 1900.36 3 . SOCIOLOGY , SOCIAL WORK , AND ETHICS This subject need detain us only for a moment . It was pointed out above that sociology and social work were closely identified at the beginning of the century . Along about 1910 they began to go their separate ways . Ward 's distinctions be tween " pure " and " applied " sociology are still sound . At the present time , sociology is very definitely emancipated from re formitarian interests.37 Sociologists are generally agreed that they must pursue their studies with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuational interests held severely in check . Hence , sociologists // deny that social work and applied sociology are sociology at all . They believe that the techniques of these arts must be more or less dependent upon sociological as upon all other scientific knowl edge , and they are agreed that the activities of welfare agencies may furnish valuable data for sociology , although on the whole they do not . Sociologists as scientists are not concerned with what uses may be made of their findings . They are like chemists in this respect . Mechanisms of human behavior may be used to poison the public mind in war time , as poison gas and explo sives may be used to destroy life and property . However , since about 1921 , when a section on sociology and social work appeared in the program of the American Sociological Society , there has been an increasing rapport between the two groups . At present , social workers are not so prone to regard sociologists as contemptuous and impractical theorists , and sociol ogists are not so inclined to look upon social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balked im pulses . Sociologists , having acquired some status among scien tists , are not so fearful of being regarded as sentimental dreamers , and social workers have developed definite professional techniques and standards . Both groups have begun to realize that they have many interests in common . The chapters on social work and applied sociology make this more explicit.38 The above remarks apply equally well to the relation between sociology and ethics , since social work goals and methods are always more or less determined by ethical considerations . How-ever , sociology , and especially social anthropology , have made a revolutionary contribution to ethical theory in the discovery of the relativity , ethnocentrism , and irrationality of the mores . I suppose Sumner 's Folkways is the greatest single contribution in // this field . Likewise , the study of culture traits , culture patterns , and acculturation has thrown floods of light upon what is " right , " and the relation of technological , geographical , and biotic factors to ethical standards , their formulation and redefinition . So we may conclude that while sociology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tends , by its comparative methods and factual generalizations , to rationalize and universalize ethical concepts.3 ? A specific ethical idea which has engaged almost all sociologists to some degree is the concept of progress . Few men have considered a sociological treatise complete without one chapter at least , usually the last one , devoted to " Progress , " and how to get it . With the decline of the Spencerian doctrine of inevitable evolutionary progress ( but with its concomitant concept of dissolution ) , the view of most sociologists has been that there is no such thing as " progress in general . " If we are to speak of progress , we must first clearly define our goals , and then devise measures to record movement toward or away from them . These proximate goals , of course , imply valuations of what is good . So ideas of progress merge into philosophies of life and supreme values . Sociology as a science may derive valid generalizations regarding human behavior , but has no final word as to what is progress . When the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence as to whether these are attainable , and if so , how to attain them ; but further than this he can not go.40 ' See H. E. Barnes , " Sociology and Ethics , " Social Forces , Jan. , 1925 , pp. 212-231 ; E. C. Hayes , Sociology and Ethics , 1921 ; in The Social Sciences and their Interrelations ( 1927 ) , edited by Ogburn and Goldenweiser , see " Anthropology and Ethics , " John Dewey , chap . iii , and " Sociology and Ethics , " P. Sorokin , chap . xxv . " Since the war , a considerable literature on progress has appeared . Practically all of it expresses the view stated in this chapter , although some is merely the expression of hopes and fears . There is a suggestion of inevitable progress in Ellwood 's graphs with the captions " animality to humanity , " " nothing to perfection , " etc. , see Cultural Evolution ( 1927 ) , pp. 254 , 261 , but his discussion , pp. 252-256 , leaves the impression that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Conditions of Social Progress , " American Journal of Sociology , July , 1922 , pp. 21-48 ; " The Concept of Social Progress , " Social Forces , Jan. , 1925 , pp. 207-212 ; May , 1925 , pp. 617-622 ; Sept. , 1925 , pp. 36-43 ; " Scientific Method and Social Progress , " American Journal of Sociology , July , 1925 , pp. 1-18 ; " Invention and Social Progress , " idem. , July , 1923 , pp. 1-33 ; C. A. // Sociologists are generally agreed that if man is to be saved , he must save himself . Man must learn what the limits of his internal and external resources are and then devote himself to making what seem the most desirable long-run adjustments in view of these limitations . Man tends to regard the actual and possible as the desirable . In this sense , perhaps Spencer 's idea of inevitable progress and regress was not entirely wrong . Chapin ( cit. supra ) has some very interesting data on the cyclical nature of change . Every organic growth tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles . I f cultures are organic growths , cycles or ecological successions would be the normal expectation . In the case of cultures , however , many culture products are transmitted to the succeeding cultures . But in plant and animal successions the soil is often made more fertile and friable . So the difference is one of degree in both cases . The concept of progress is at once the most fascinating and most elusive so far as actual scientific data and inference are concerned . IV . SUMMARY OF TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY The foregoing section has been chiefly concerned with negative criticisms of sociological theory ; and yet , in so far as general agreements among American sociologists have been indicated , we have really been discussing trends in theory . Over twenty years ago , Small tried to state the agreements then existing among sociologists . There was considerable disagreement at the time.41 Today I should not agree with more than four or five of his twenty points . I have little faith that even a majority of sociologists will agree with my propositions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less than my present // agreement with Small , but I shall venture to state , as briefly as I can , what seem to me the outstanding lines of development in American sociology . z . Sociology is a natural science . As such it is non-utilitarian , non-normative , and no more " important " than any other natural science . It is not the final science in the Comtean sense , nor the centralizer of the other sciences . Its data are no more complex or difficult to observe and generalize than those of other sciences . Its methods are not uniquely different from those of other sciences . The only data with which it deals are those that are observable by the senses aided by the objectifying devices of logic , mathematics and instrumentation . These data are the activities of men in groups as conditioned by culture . Sociology will become increasingly behavioristic , with a corresponding decrease of emphasis upon subjective , unobservable " forces , " " drives , " " wishes , " " instincts , " and the like . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other qualitative methods will tend to be subordinated to quantitative approaches . The two methods will probably always be complementary and supplementary as they are in the other sciences , but validation of hypotheses will depend upon mathematical manipulation of carefully defined , observed , and recorded objective units . " The center of attention and principle of synthesis " will not be personality , as Small contended in 1907 , but rather the repetitive uniformities in the behavior of persons , i. e. , group phenomena . The units are not significant ; the uniformities are . As chemists are not concerned with the uniqueness of atoms and electrons , so sociologists will not be concerned with the behavior of individuals , or persons , as such ; social artists and ethicists will . That is their business , as the business of sociologists is to generalize human behavior . But adequate generalization is a sine qua non of particularization . This is the only way in which the behavior of units gains any scientific meaning.42 . ' a For good examples of the application of statistical method to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Measuring the Volume of Social Stimuli , " March , 1926 , pp. 479-4g5 ' ' , ? t= ' " Dependency Indexes for Minneapolis , " // 3 . Sociology will be increasingly monographic . The day of glittering generalities and cosmic theories is about past in sociological theory . The angels of science fear to tread upon this dangerous ground . Cooley well expressed it when he said , " . . . Original work is likely to take the direction of more limited but thorough studies . This work will be theoretical . . . but the theory will spring from a more circumscribed and penetrating study of fact . . . . The new generation will not tolerate arm-chair sociology . ' " 4a Sociologists have been much more prolific of theories than of facts . They have written about methods more than they have used them . The present trend is quite in the opposite direction . Theories are becoming much more specific and less final ; conclusions are more modest and tentative and tend to be based upon carefully conducted factual researches which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man gains status in the profession by actual research rather than by brilliant literary efforts . Most men agree that the time for valid scientific sociological " laws " and " principles " is far distant . Sociologists are going to school with the anthropologists and psychologists in this respect . We have a considerable number of apparently valid sociological generalizations , but most of them do not differ much from common-sense observations of long standing . Many of them may be false . Only careful , tedious , specialized investigations can furnish the factual data from which real scientific generalizations can be made . For the present , valid sociological generalizations are very limited , both in scope and number . 4 . Sociology is rapidly becoming specialized . This is a corol108 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY lary of the above and needs no elaboration . Rural , urban , and educational sociology , human ecology , human geography , social psychology , cultural ethnology , community organization and planning , social work , " applied " sociology ( criminology , poverty , immigration , recreation , family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. ) , social legislation and sociological jurisprudence , social statistics , population , social theory , social economics , social ethics and religion , are examples of this . Within each group , further specialization is to be noted . Likewise , there is a marked vagueness and overlapping in the activities and interests of the various groups . It is unnecessary to develop this point . It is possible that sociology will eventually become merely a general term for describing these related fields of investigation . They are all more or less barking up the same tree , viz. , attempting to formulate repetitive uniformities in human group behavior . They deal with culture rather than with other types of natural phenomena . Perhaps some such compromise term as " culturology " will be born . Each of the academic groups tries to swallow the others , but with small success . It makes no difference under what banner the work is done , although waste of time and energy and much internecine warfare results from men 's ( even professors ' ! ) bondage to names . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the types of study which are likely to contribute most to the sociology of the future , or even to name those that show present trends in the direction of dominance . However , I shall mention a few that seem to me most promising . This does not imply that research in the other fields will cease or diminish . There is little doubt that all phases of the scientific study of human associational phenomena will command an increasing amount of money and talent in the future . 5 . Human ecology is likely to be one of the most fruitful , as it is one of the most recent , modes of sociological analysis . There is a lively and increasing interest in it among some of the most promising sociologists . Human ecology studies man , or groups // of men in their temporal , spatial , sustenance , and cultural rela tions , and the processes of interaction between these factors . " This approach enables the investigator to deal with concrete , ob jective , measurable data and to arrange them in a time-series . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their beha vior in time and space , than with what they say , feel , dream , and wish . It lends itself especially well to the behavioristic trend in sociology , already mentioned as one of the outstanding charac teristics of recent sociological theory . It has conceptual tools already clearly defined by studies in plant and animal ecology ? such as symbiosis , succession , segregation , invasion , domi nance , mobility , emigration , competition , barriers ? which can be applied to the behavior of human groups as true descriptive terms , thus avoiding the analogical pitfalls which have characterized so many biological concepts when applied to cultural phenomena . It is obvious , of course , that this approach is not particularly new . The works of many geographers , ethnologists and some philos ophers of history contain its intellectual antecedents . Montes quieu , Buckle , Reclus , Peschel , Ratzel , Vallaux , L. Metchnikoff , 1 ) emolins , Huntington , Semple , Bruhnes , and the American an thropologists should be mentioned in this connection . However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human ecology a distinctive sociological concept . 6 . Another very promising approach is the ethnological , con cerned as it is with culture traits , culture complexes , culture areas , and culture patterns , their origin , diffusion and integration . It is easy to point out similarities between these concepts and those f ecology . They both have the advantage of dealing with group adjustments and group behavior in an objective descriptive man  - -  tier . As I have pointed out earlier , cultural anthropology has already made invaluable contributions to sociological theory . I think its work is only now getting well under way . About the only distinction I can see between sociology and ethnology is that // the latter has largely concerned itself with the culture of pre-historic and pre-literate peoples , while the former has been more concerned with historic and present cultures . Both are phases of sociology or culturology . I think ethnological methods will be increasingly applied to the study of contemporary culture.45 7 . Another marked trend is the development of social psychol ogy . It is very difficult to distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social psychology . If we think of sociology proper as formulating the repetitive uni formities of group behavior with no concern for the behavior of persons as such , we may conceive of social psychology as for mulating the repetitive uniformities in the behavior of persons through conformity or non-conformity to the culture patterns defined by the intercommunication of group members . This is not wholly satisfactory , however , because all culture patterns are resident in the organisms of persons . There is an organic rela tionship between persons and the common behavior patterns ob servable in the numerous groups of which each person is a member . But if we think of groupal adjustments as abstractions of these common , personal , culturally defined actions , with no at tention paid to the behavior of persons as such , we may have a logical basis for a division of labor . The social psychologist is interested in the processes by which these groupal patterns are elaborated , maintained and modi fied . The human ecologist , or culturologist , is interested in the observation and generalization of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of view . It follows , then , that the psychologist proper must be an animal psychologist , interested in the neuro-muscular behavior of man the animal , while the social psychologist is interested in the social behavior of man the human being who is the maker and acquirer of culture . Most of the so-called psychology of today , advertis ing , business , educational , psycho-analytic , abnormal , etc. , is thus // really social psychology . The rest of it is largely the anatomy , physiology and pathology of the nervous systems of men and other animals . Traditional psychology has thus fallen between two stools , biology and sociology . Social psychology is flourishing these days and will continue to flourish . It has made and will continue to make great contri butions to the definition and solution of personality problems and the whole mental hygiene movement . It will take the mysticism out of psycho-analysis and formulate in scientific sociological terms the remarkable contributions of that over-praised and much condemned school . The writings of Dewey , Cooley , Thomas , Faris , Bogardus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mor gan , J. M. Williams , Lowie , Bernard , K. Young , and many others , including the Freudians and psychiatrists , demonstrate the close kinship between social psychology and culturology. 8 . Community study will probably increase in importance , but it will become more similar to the human ecology already de-scribed . The National Community Center Association is now concerning itself increasingly with community and regional plan ning , since a wise community plan must integrate urban com munities with the rural and primary supply hinterland . This port of planning will necessarily involve an anthropogeographic or ecological approach . With the growth of urbanization and modern industrial techniques , it is obvious that increasing atten tion must be given to these problems.4s We may look for increased activity in rural sociology as a result of the Purnell Funds , recently made available to the land-grant agricultural colleges . Rural sociology is not a distinctive study , of course , except as it is devoted to the study of group be havior in rural areas . It will be characterized by the ecological , social psychological , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proaches already referred to . I mention it specifically only because of the recent extreme activity in this field . And it will doubtless continue  --  so long as research money is available.47 9 . Social work will increase in importance and become more and more dependent upon sociology and social psychology both for its techniques and objectives . While the distinctions between social work as an art , and sociology as a science , and the differ ence between social problems , social work problems , and sociologi cal problems made in Chapter IX of this volume are and will remain logically sound , I believe that the interrelations and inter-dependence of the art and science of social relations are bound to increase to their mutual benefit . This has been true of all arts and sciences . There is an inescapable organic relation between them . It is impossible to say whether " flesh helps soul more than soul helps flesh . " 1o . Finally , I believe the now almost non-existent , or negative interest of sociologists in religion and ethics will be replaced by a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heresy to many , but I trust the future will justify it . In the last analysis , men are governed by their valuations and judgments of what they think is fundamentally and externally worth while . These are the things for which they strive , sacrifice , live , and die . This is their religion ? those purposes for which they work religiously , those wishful objectives which stimulate their imagi nations and release their best energies . Now , in general , these value-judgments tend to conform to what collective experience shows to be possible . With due regard for irrational inertia and cultural lags , the possible and actual become the desirable . Religious ideas and ideals are reflections of cultural behavior . If sociology is to be a science of human group behavior , it is obvious that it can not long neglect this most important field . And it is also evident that supernaturalistic , other-worldly con ceptions of religion are being and will increasingly be replaced ' l'ItENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY 113 by naturalistic , this-worldly conceptions . Ideals that " strike fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human and other natural phenomena as determined by scientific research . The church will become a social institution which defines and criticizes these fundamental values . If it is to be functional , it must depend upon what men do and are capable of doing as revealed by scientific research . The values that were formerly related to hypothetical gods and heavens and hells and supernatural agencies must be integrated with the validated findings of science . We know enough about the social psychology of conversions , visions , intuitions , morals , suggestions , and repressions , to interpret " religious experience " in naturalistic terms . So the relation of sociology to religion will be in the nature of a redefinition and revaluation of values . Sociology and the other sciences will furnish the materials which must be integrated in the art of living . From this point of view , all men are " religious , " i. e. , they have life-integrating ( or dis-integrating ) values . This field of psycho-sociological research , at present woefully unworked , will become very fertile in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust that I have given the reader some understanding of the road traveled by American sociology since 1900 , as well as some hints of what I think the future journey holds . Small was essentially correct , I think , when he spoke of the " Era of Sociology " at the dawn of the present century . Sociology has now become a sturdy youngster , perhaps still somewhat post-adolescent , but it gives good promise of a fruitful maturity . It has been adopted ( with reservations by some of the " elders " ) in the household of science . It has raked up and burned much rubbish and still has much to do in this respect ; but in America , at least , it has largely emancipated itself from philosophical , metaphysical , ethico-religious , economic , geographic , biological , analogical , historical , metaphorical , and other non-naturalistic dogmas and preconceptions . It // conceives of itself as a natural science , using the methods and suffering the limitations of all science . It realizes the mutual in terdependence of all the sciences ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dominance or " greater importance . " It is committed to the accumulation of a valid body of sociological facts through slow , careful , laborious research . It is extremely chary of making wide generalizations . Such as are ventured are put forth in the most tentative manner and must be tested by repeated factual investigations . In closing , it should be recalled that any attempt to set forth the trends in sociological theories is by the nature of the case an intellectual or imaginative tour de force more akin to prophecy than to science . It is possible to make a factual study of the interests of sociologists as revealed by publications , theses , and courses , and possibly to deduce some implications of " trends " therefrom . A few such studies are cited elsewhere in this volume , but the paucity and subjective nature of these investigations makes them practically useless for the purposes of this chapter . No one can be more conscious than the writer of the inadequacies of the method used in this chapter . Its net result is " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less informed guesses . So far sociological theory and research have been less pro ductive of scientific facts than they have of hypotheses , specula tion , and wishful thinking ; yet I think we may conclude that they have brought into existence a more realistic way of regarding human phenomena than formerly obtained . The behavior of men , singly and in groups , has been largely removed from the realm of mystery and magic . We have learned at least how to approach the scientific study of human behavior . " We study social habits now as phenomena no longer charged with dread , and thus learn how wisely to adjust and control them to our bet terment. " 48 We have not yet thoroughly realized the implica tions of the statement that " social phenomena are natural phe nomena ? sociology is a natural science , " but we are learning . The trends of sociological theory are all keyed to this note . CHAPTER III TRENDS IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY By John F. Markey I. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF THE CHAPTER A NOTED social scientist who recently wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " uttered a pointed truth con cerning controversy for its own sake . One might add that he who avoids controversial questions does little digging of any kind , for new facts have iconoclastic tendencies . The advance of knowl edge has seldom been won without contest , and the proponents of new views usually can not escape serious criticism . Of course it is too bad , although sometimes amusing , to see a person caught in his own bear trap , but if one would catch the game he must be willing to take some risk . So , notwithstanding the danger therein , some controversial subjects must be discussed in this chapter . But the plan is to avoid futile debate . It is not the intention to gave an historical treatment of the subject , nor to discuss the theories of various authors . ' The purpose is to give a clear and critical statement concerning recent significant developments in social psychology . The amount of attention given to some persons and the lack of attention to thers may seem arbitrary , but this is subsidiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many different angles from which this study Is approached , a fair degree of consensus is arising that social psychology studies the responses of individuals to social influ ences , such as cultural heritage , institutions , groups , persons , and social situations . In its beginnings , two distinct emphases ap peared . One gave main consideration to the similarity of re-115 // sponses running throughout the group , and the other gave special attention to a genetic study of individual social responses . The science was started on its infant career with the first emphasis , as a cross-sectional study of the social behavior of interacting per-sons . Comparatively less attention was given to the genetic as pects of the response itself . In order for the cross-sectional ap proach to give a functional2 and sequential explanation , it may go in two directions : into sociology proper or a study of the group as such , or into a genetic study of the responses themselves . The cross-sectionalist took , largely , the first course . Somewhat independently of this cross-sectional approach , we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects by taking the individual as a starting point . In general perspective , one notes two contrasting attitudes as to the degree to which the individual was and is regarded as a separate entity : the view that he is the dominant cause , on account of instinct , or otherwise , of social phenomena , hence relatively independent of it ; and the conception that he is an integral part of various social groupings , one link in a causal or sequential social chain ? a social being . Thus , society and the individual are regarded as two aspects of common phenomena . Increased knowledge of the processes involved has thrown the trend decidedly toward this latter view . At present , the most fruitful development comes from a union of the study of social groups and social situations , i.e. , social stimuli , with the study of the social individual , i.e. , the responses of the individual to these social stimuli , as made , for instance , by C. H. Cooley or G. H. Mead . Two recent texts by L. L. Bernard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social or group approach methodologically gives a much more satisfactory basis than the individual , for marking // out and limiting problems for study , since social responses tend to be arranged and differentiated by the groups in which persons function . The purpose of the present chapter will be to examine first the tendencies in the cross-sectional approach . Secondly , we shall consider the social response approach , tracing its develop ment away from the conception of the asocial individual to that of the social individual and toward a more behavioristic and mechanistic 4 explanation of social behavior . Of special impor tance in this connection is the emphasis upon objective social anal ysis . Social psychology reminds one of an ostrich with its head in the " subjective . " If it ever comes up to look around , the " subjective " may be found to be objective , similar to the sky and the rest of the surroundings . But in any case , social psychology is digging more seriously into the study of the social conditioning of the individual , his social mechanisms , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motive and symbolic complexes , his selves , personality , and the like , and into a study of the manner in which social processes , social situations , the environment , group ings and group acts are functionally connected with the responses of individuals . In this work the so-called subjective is being brought to light and found to be observable and amenable to objective study . Along with the influence of sociological development , including the study of culture , ' a constant source of reorientation has come from advances in psychological , psychiatric , neurological and physiological knowledge . Some of the more outstanding of these trends will be indicated . The next task will be to indicate a // scientific framework for social psychology , discussing some neglected phases , and finally to make an estimate of the outlook for this discipline . The history of social psychology is marked by conceptions tracking into blind alleys , explanations which do not enlighten , and theories which , if accepted , would lead one hopelessly away from reality . An urgent need is for more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent insight and theory in order for it to be most fruitful . For this reason , and since they are pivots for important trends in social psychology , it will be our task to examine as we go along some of these " horrible " examples ? skeletons which in most cases social psychology has not yet been able to get into the closet , to say nothing of keeping them there . Of course the purpose is to give main attention to the more positive contributions . II . THE CROSS-SECTIONAL APPROACH This approach is illustrated by those writers who regard social psychology as a study of social planes and uniformities among persons . Such writers as E. A. Ross , F. H. Giddings and , to a certain degree , E. S. Bogardus and C. A. Ellwood , illustrate this type . This goes back , of course , to Bagehot and Continental writers . As studies in social psychology in distinction from sociology , they represent attempts to see the responses of the individuals of a society or group in a cross-section , partially in time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more or less static picture of the responses of persons . An outstanding weakness of this approach in its simple form consists in the lack of explanation of how and why these responses are what they are . Since the responses are treated separately , their genetic and functional character may not be at all clearly shown . The sociologists mentioned have enhanced the value of their work by going in varying degrees to sociology , or less frequently into a genetic study of particular social responses . However , they have not obtained as much help from these sources as // they might have , for frequently they have accepted or directly assumed explanations which were too simple or inadequate and which showed too little familiarity with the social factors which were operative . As an example of this may be cited briefly the imitation theory which has been widely used by this type of approach , and is still used , although to a much lesser degree . Although some have regarded imitation as one of a pair of Siamese twins , the connection with suggestion is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general , writers have felt the need of analyzing conditions of suggestibility so that this category has not been the bugbear that the imitation part of the theory has been . It is quite true that some persons have assumed some abstract or general quality of suggestibility , but more careful students are examining specific conditions of susceptibility to stimuli called suggestions . This is a most fruitful type of study . The powerful response connections conditioned to stimuli called suggestions are dynamic agencies in social processes , particularly in the symbolic processes of persons . But the connection of the imitation twin with suggestion has sometimes vitiated the explanation of suggestion , since imitation was given as a reason for suggestibility , and the reason for imitation was that we copy the actions and ideas of others , a quite unsatisfactory statement . It is imitation that has become the dark region . The above-mentioned writers , including J. M. Baldwin , will call to mind the role and emphasis which imitation has been given in early social psychological works . Such uniformities as fashions , customs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the explanation of them ? Imitation ? and we know as much as we did before . The great difficulty with so much of the discussion of imitation is that it becomes a resting place , stopping far short of a clear statement of how people learn to imitate and of the social interactions involved in the process of acquiring the skill to imitate . It is now generally recognized that one can not imitate unless // he knows how to do so . A quite obvious statement when it is said , but one which a number of social psychologists have ignored . It is clear that one can not imitate Caruso unless he is a singer , or Tilden unless he is a tennis player . Also the work of Thorn-dike , Watson , Porter , Kohler , Berry , Bird , and Shephard should warn one against placing much confidence in an instinct of imi tation . Further , the degree or amount of imitation is a relative thing . Most writers on the subject do not seem to feel the neces sity of explaining how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call the result imitation . It still remains for someone to give imitation a thoroughly genetic treatment . Perhaps the category is not worth salvaging , but if it is , some more thorough analysis of it must be made . The present decided tendency away from the use of the imitation theory type of explanation will con tinue unless a different line of attack appears more fruitful . ' Another and equally defective characteristic of the imitation theory is its too broad generalization . Many things have been explained by imitation which were not imitation , nor the result of learning to copy . The similarity may be due to conditioning , to quite different stimuli , or to different response mechanisms altogether . Since imitation was often an a priori explanation , it was quite easily applied to uniformities regardless of their genetic or functional relationship . Studies of the group have shown well how important are group integrations , division of labor , co-operation , and conflict , in explaining uniformities and regulari ties . ' Bernard suggests that the concept may still be useful to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true for those sciences which attempt to explain group behav ior rather than individual responses , but the social psychologist // must explain imitation . He can not take it as a datum . For him at best it is the name for a process which he must describe and analyze . An example in point is the work of Cooley as con trasted with that of Baldwin . ' The latter 's use of imitation in explaining the social role of individuals shows thin places , in marked contrast to Cooley 's more complete and developed expla nation by a functional description of social processes . The pres ent attention to these social factors and upon learning , condi tioning , and habit formation is quite healthy . We will not discuss the social mind incubus which is so closely connected with the cross-sectional study , being a part of its inheri tance . It is better not to disturb it for , due to neglect , it seems in a fair way of passing out . In the main , it is in reality a type of group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discussion of sociology than in the present discussion of social psychology . I do not intend a mere terminological point here . Although the study of group behavior might well be called social psychology , it actually represents a different frame of generaliza tion than that ordinarily accepted by social psychologists . The social mind theory from this standpoint falls outside of the pur view of social psychology . ' The literature on crowd psychology has been closely connected with the cross-sectional approach , and the study has attracted much attention . A great deal of the discussion has been con cerned with the group as such . Its contribution from the stand-point of social psychology has been in the description of crowd situations and in the determination of typical responses of indi viduals under these circumstances . The material of crowd psy chology needs a critical survey , both from the standpoint of methodology and of fact . Martin , 10 for instance , illustrates a peculiar mixture in frames of references as well as an apparent // tendency to call social action which he does not like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach is to point out , summarize , and compare typical responses to particular situa tions . A definite trend has been toward more precise and statis tical treatment of materials gathered for such study . Its most exact treatment has been at the hands of psychologists who have been more ready to tabulate responses in frequency series from which may be computed averages , measures of dispersion , and correlations . An example of this is such studies as those made by F. H. Allport on group facilitation , which are of such a nature that others can check on the methods of analysis . Also a great number of psychological tests fall under this type of study . For instance , Hartshorne and May , with their tests on knowledge of right and wrong , believe they have also demonstrated in certain measurements the existence of a group differential . ' 1 However , a growing body of studies by sociologists demonstrates the more exact and statistical use of this approach , and they have also generally avoided some of its weaknesses by going into a more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group as a phenomenon , however , as was noted , one changes his frame of reference , i.e. , his point of view or his basis of observation and measurement . The group be-comes his locus or unit of uniformity and regularity . If this be accepted as the province of sociology , he has for the time being left the field of social psychology . This , of course , is quite legitimate and useful . But it is to be observed that often investi gators , in their attempt to get a functional and causal explanation of cross-section response material , do change their frame of reference without seemingly being aware of the fact . They someTRENDS // times fall into unnecessary confusion in their analysis , which a recognition of the shift in point of view would have prevented . When one is generalizing in regard to the responses of individuals to social stimuli , he has one frame of reference for the establish ment of laws and regularities . When he is generalizing in regard to group processes , responses of groups , the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalization . Thus , while a large part of Ross ' Social Psychology attempts to outline typical responses , a great deal of the book is given over to group re sponses and social processes considered as group phenomena . Sumner 's work 13 is in large part generalized on a group phe nomena framework , and is a study in sociology proper . Since we are interested here with the social psychological point of view , we shall continue our analysis from the standpoint of the social responses of individuals rather than that of group responses . The study of group responses is not to be confused methodologi cally with an approach to the study of individual responses from the standpoint of the group , for the latter is a highly advantageous approach in social psychology . III . GENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL RESPONSES Some students still regard the individual as a distinctively independent unit . Although a genetic study of the individual response mitigates the artificial character of such a view , it is not until these genetic data are seen as integral or organic parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a statement which approaches a satisfactory one . The discus sion immediately following will deal with the trend in this latter direction . The increased attention to mechanistic and behavior istic social study and emphasis upon social conditioning , habit mechanisms , personality complexes , reflective behavior and the like , in relation to social processes and group situations , will be indicated . // I. THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS DOGMA There has been much raging about the validity of instincts . This dogma popularized by William McDougall 14 received early and widespread acceptance . But while it is quite obvious that there are inherited mechanisms , attempts to explain the individ ual 's social action or the group 's action , i.e. , sociology , by in stincts , is undoubtedly a lazy way of avoiding thought on these subjects . The attack by Dunlap , Kantor , Josey , Bernard , Faris , Kuo , Watson and others " has led to a much saner attitude in regard to instincts . In spite of this , one frequently sees social scientists explaining the family by the sex instinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play instinct , or the group by the gregarious instinct . The social world is thus set out in order , ready-made and diagramed . The thing is simple ; why worry about the complex system of social interaction involved in these institutions when they can be so easily taken care of by putting instincts into people ? But psychologists are recognizing that our heredity is quite plastic and rudimentary , and that any explanation of social behavior must bring into reckoning social conditioning and training before we can understand social life . It is also apropos to say that much of the structure of the body is not instinct , even though it may be inherited . Neither are physiological needs , rates of metabolism and organic states , instincts . There are many irritability traits of protoplasm lying back of and conditioning human behavior which can not be called instinct , but which many social psychologists and sociologists have failed to distinguish therefrom . A thorough study of proto plasmic irritability traits is highly enlightening and makes some of the claims of a thundering instinctivist sound rather hollow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // connection . Instinct is sometimes used to apply to an inherited complex coordination of reflexes and is sometimes used to designate an inherited reflex itself . Thus , when one person denies the inheritance of complex coordinations which he calls instincts , other persons take it to mean that he denies all inherited reflexes . And another may argue for the existence of instincts , meaning only reflexes . The consensus is growing that we inherit a large number of reflexes and few complex coordinations of reflexes . In some cases the attackers of instinct have headed into another flight from reality . They have opposed the environment to instincts . This has gone so far in the hands of some as to make social psychology and sociology a study of environment . Now environment is a very useful conception but of itself is not a sufficiently complete framework for a social science . A most pertinent question here is , What is the center around which this environment revolves ? It often leads to a highly fictitious situation , to chop our social world up into environment on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual plant or animal is taken as an organic unit of study , its environment becomes a quite useful conception . In sociology , where the group is taken as a unit , it may also be a useful concept at times . But the analysis of processes between groups and within groups seems to have been a much more fruitful method of analysis than the separation of social phenomena into groups and their environment . In social psychology , where the responses of individuals to social influence is the unit of analysis rather than the individual as such , the division of all these phenomena into environment and something environed introduces a quite structuralistic classification , as well as terms less satisfactory than the statements generalizing the actual character of the influences and the responses to them . Social psychology is a study which cuts across the individual and his environment . Further , in regard to heredity , it can not be rightly regarded as antithetical to the environ126 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY ment . These terms are both supplementary . since heredity in volves environment in its very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " en vironmental " conception of social life , it seems doubtful whether this will become so widely spread or distorted as to lead social psychology too far into the wilderness ; for those who adhere to the idea often go much beyond it in concrete analysis , to a more organic treatment . A leavening approach , especially in relation to instinct versus environment , is that concerned with habit mech anisms , the social situation , and the total act . For instance , John Dewey in Human Nature and Conduct , has elaborated a very suggestive philosophy of social psychology based upon habit mech anisms . Instead of instinct , he uses the conception of impulse indicating a much more plastic condition . Impulses form pivots around which new habits may be built up , old habits broken down and redirected or reintegrated . But impulse , except for its em phasis upon plasticity , is also quite indefinite and unsatisfactory as a tool of analysis . 2 . WISHES , DESIRES , MOTIVES , NEEDS We next come to the concept of wishes , desires , wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention given to them by numer ous writers and , according to some , social psychology mainly consists of a study of one or another of them . One quite obvious reason why these clinging vines still choke the study of social psychology is the appealing character of them . They are intense , vivid heart-throb experiences , and some students are unwilling to have them generalized by counting on abstract analysis ? each one must be studied and felt individually . Of course a graphic picture of a pungent desire is more impressive to one 's emotions , perhaps , than Ioox desires or an xy relationship . But science has found it necessary to classify and abstract common traits , and to ignore unique and non-repetitive phenomena . An apple falling // on Newton 's head is much more graphic than the law of gravitation . Salt on the tongue is much more tasty than a chemical analysis of NaCl . The young forlorn is quite comic compared to a discussion of social recognition or social status . Social psychology is at present mainly in the stage where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulate a law of gravity ; or , more concretely , where desires , wishes , longings , interests ? the vague subjective ? are so enticing and real that the social psychologist does not want to leave this elementary stage . Of course concrete events furnish the content for the formulation of general laws . There obviously is more in desires , wishes , etc. , than infantile toys of the social psychologists . There is material ready for scientific analysis , but we need more fruitful methods of attack . Perhaps the most serious blank wall that these categories have run into is the treatment of such conceptions as metaphysical entities and " elements , " and the view that they are something intangible ? unobservable affairs . They have too often been looked upon as " the " cause or as " the " social forces . They have been accepted as explanations rather than as something to be explained . For instance , Thomas proposes his four wishes to explain human behavior . H. Hart proposes as fundamental the desire to function , as an explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do . Bushee proposes his set of desires , Small and Ross their sets of interests , Allport his biological need , and so on through the list . It is quite easy . Here is something we do not understand . It is easy to posit a desire or wish or what not as its cause or explanation , just as the instinctivists and even the reflexologists have sometimes done . For instance , Pavlov 's " reflex of freedom " or his " reflex of purpose " has the earmarks . And he , according to Sorokin , is a " pure " behaviorist . The use of desires and the like as " the " causes is similar to the practice of a chemist who would posit certain metaphysical " forces " resident in the valences of different chemical substances . But chemists do not think , except in a mechanistic sense , of a // force making two atoms of hydrogen pounce upon a lone atom of oxygen to produce water . This of course would be more pictur esque to our anthropomorphic way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us in understanding these phenomena . Similarly , in social psychology we cease to look for the forces in terms of desires , or wishes . An important task is the reverse , to show how desires , wishes , etc. , are the results of social interaction , as well as to see them as parts in a functional sequence , or correla tion of relationships . In a later section on the subjective we shall return to a further consideration of these categories from a slightly different angle . 3 . ATTITUDES We next come to attitudes . This category has recently been sharply criticized , 18 especially by Read Bain , on the grounds of the methodological difficulties which current definitions present to one carrying on concrete research . Attitude has been used to apply to tendencies and impulses to act , inhibited impulses , drives and motor sets , feelings , wishes , desires and vegetative processes , opinions , positive and negative verbal responses , and habits , or a mixture of some of these . If the difficulties of the definitions found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as tools of research will soon convince one of their inadequacy . They do not clearly differentiate attitude from other associated or related processes . Often also , attitudes are made unduly vague by a " **26;345;TOOLONG " type of defi nition . The conception of attitudes is thus in such a state that some would discard the term altogether . But a more constructive procedure is to define attitude more clearly , for it is a very useful social conception . Bain 's attempt at a behavioristic definition is a step in the right direction . He defines attitude as " the relatively stable overt behavior of a person which affects his status . " Since // attitude is to be a social category and must be differentiated from habits and vegetative processes as such , the " status-fixing " ele ment is introduced.19 He would throw out of consideration un observable " hypothetical " subjective states . That this emphasis upon behavior and action adds much to the methodological utility of the concept attitude may be readily conceded . This can be clone without committing oneself to numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ellsworth Faris in an opposing article 20 has rightly criticized these statements by Bain , but he has put forward no valid objec tion to Bain 's major point . It is probable also that most of the criticisms are based upon verbal differences . For example , Bain makes such indefensible denials as the following : " It is imma terial to the scientist what so-called subjective ' motives , or wishes or desires induce people to wear shoes to banquets . . . . It may be pride in small feet , to please wives , to keep feet dry , or what not . The scientist is concerned only with the fact that they do it . " 21 But such statements do an injustice to Bain 's view on the subject . He would make overt synonymous with the observed . He actually would take account of all of these wishes , desires , or motives , whenever they were observable , in behavior , either by verbation or other action . It is difficult to see how so-called sub jective experience can be taken account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers , " unless they do become in some manner observ able through speech or other action . Faris , on the other hand , makes a case for subjective experi ence and for the definition of attitude as a " tendency to act . " 22 His view may be summarized as follows : Actions are temporal sequences . They have beginnings in which " motives , " " desires , " " objectives , " etc. , enter ; they have endings in which satisfac130 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY tion or dissatisfaction is felt ; and some of them have a middle or mediating phase in which all important subjective experiences occur . Reflective action is particularly important , where takes place planning , deliberation and reasoning to meet a situation . In view of the temporal character of actions , we are interested in what men " are about to do , in what they can be induced to do . " Therefore the necessity of considering attitudes " as tendencies to action , " designating proclivity , or bent , or predisposition to a certain type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be limited to designate muscular set when behavior is immanent , for attitudes exist when no behavior is immanent , latent but real.23 Bernard , who has written a good discussion of attitudes , places more emphasis upon the beginning phase of attitude , his view being that attitudes are incomplete or potential adjust ment behavior involving the set of the organism toward the situa tion calling for adjustment . As " adjustment proceeds , the behav ior is transformed from attitudinal or preparatory into true or successful adjustment . " 24 This behavior which follows is not identical with attitude , and " when the adjustment is made the attitude disappears , except in so far as it is retained in memory or in the habitual set of the organism . " The attitude is strong or weak in inverse proportion to the amount of the adjustment unexecuted , and directly proportional to the strength of the drives behind the adjustment behavior . This differs from Faris ' view , in that the latter puts greater emphasis upon the more constant and habitual set involved in attitude . Bain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by these partial prepara tory responses and would call the total response the attitude . Bernard and Faris are apparently agreed on the inclusion of desires and subjective experience , although Bernard is more be havioristic in his exposition . He would advocate a behavioristic explanation of these phases . But Faris also would evidently reTRENDS // gard them as some kind of action , and the difference between " behavior " and the action of organisms is perhaps arbitrary . Their different emphasis regarding the stable or transient charac ter of attitude helps to clarify the issue . It would seem quite obvious that attitudes remain with us as Faris suggests . Bernard apparently also agrees to attitudes remaining in the habitual set of the organism . Further , the strength or force of the expression of the attitude will vary with the situation which stimulates it . Bernard and Faris have simply emphasized certain characteristics and slighted others in this connection . The issue between Bain and Faris , and between Bain and Bernard , too , is , however , quite real . Shall attitude be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it to designate only the beginning sets and predis positions ( including the so-called subjective ) to specific behavior ? A second question is raised by Bain . Is attitude to be used as a social category or a more inclusive one , as the definition of Faris and Bernard would indicate ? While it is recognized that in any case most of our attitudes would be social , still the discussions of the latter do not so limit them . These questions raise a real problem , especially a methodologi cal one . How are we to study " tendencies to act " as peculiar to attitudes ? 25 Tendencies to act , if used in a scientific sense , apply to all behavior . And , as Bain suggests , to divide preparatory behavior from the rest of behavior as distinctive of attitudes pre sents an inadequate basis for concrete investigation . The division seems bound to be arbitrary . Further , all habitual action is in a real sense preparation for action . It is possible to formulate a more constructive statements The study of attitudes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense this is true of all scientific study , but in most cases the attention is upon what does occur . In prediction , the attention // is upon what is likely to occur . Now in order to predict , we study not only one factor but all factors which will enable us to predict . In attitudinal study we are interested in all signs , conditions , or habits which point out the attitude . One may use opinions , speech reactions , past behavior , habitual behavior , etc.26 Of course it is desirable to get a single measure , if possible , and , failing this , to get a single variable which will be sufficiently accurate to use as a basis for judgment and prediction . Hence it is well to discover how closely speech reactions and other criteria correspond to the other reactions of the person , and how closely these may be taken as a guide to probable future action . For we often want to know beforehand what a person 's reaction will be in situations in which he never has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such information is a necessary part of our social life . The term " attitude " has in general come to designate such habits , sets , verbalizations , and experience which will influence and give a cue to the probable behavior of a person toward the object or particular situation under consideration . It is , perhaps , necessary to emphasize that since attitudes do refer to such particular objects or situations , a careful and clear definition of these , regarding which we wish to learn the attitudes , is quite necessary in attitu dinal study . Second , attitude is thus a term to designate a more or less thorough integration or complex of behavior toward an object or situation . Park and Burgess ' expression , a " mobilization of the will , " has this idea in it , although the expression itself in terms of will is quite loose.27 To regard attitude , as Bernard does , as always implying lack of adjustment ? unless this term is stretched to a meaningless extent ? does not seem valid . Two partners , or " boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted nevertheless have attitudes toward each other . // It is necessary to include facilitation , summation , and supplemen tation as factors in attitudes . Of course , in many cases a blocking of some kind is present , and often there are opposing or conflict ing elements in an attitude . Another methodological difficulty with Bernard 's conception is that when behavior is most evident , most actively in progress and supposedly most open to study , the attitude disappears . It makes of attitude a sort of will-o ' - the- wisp . When it really gets into operation it fades away . Third , attitude also generally implies , as suggested by Thomas and Znaniecki 's discussion , 2S some sort of reflective or , as sug gested by Bernard 's writing , anticipatory behavior . There is a mobilization or organization around some object , social value , or motif , in which reflective or anticipatory behavior is involved . To limit attitude only to the habitual would not allow sufficiently for " thinking " in attitude , since reflective behavior occurs when some habits are interrupted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the person may never have been . This does not deny the great importance of habit in attitudes , however . But it does mean that ideas , motives , desires , wishes , ideals may enter into an attitudinal integration . These , however , are to be explained in terms of behavior . When speaking of reflective behavior as a factor in attitude , it also must be remembered that an attitude may become so habitual that we are practically unaware of it . A way of approaching an understanding of attitudes which may be helpful is to regard them as behavior integrations in as sociation with a more or less complex sign or symbol situation . A sign or symbol stimulus or response refers to something else of which it is a substitute or representative , and the attitudinal response in this connection would be action indicative of past and probable future behavior in regard to the object or situation signified or symbolized ; or , if the situation were actually present , more specifically conditioned behavior might be noted . In order that these sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some previously formed habit adjustments , experience and integration in relation to them and the actual situation . If the symbols become confused , the attitude or responses also become indefinite or confused . The integration of new symbols involves more or less new attitudes toward the situation , object , act or social value . Symbol situations thus allow for some sort of reflective behavior in attitude . The sign situation , while not necessarily involving reflective behavior , involves responses in connection with potential future behavior and is quite similar to the symbolsituational response . We have numerous cases of sign situations among animals , and humans as well , which are associated with attitudinal behavior quite similar to those attitudinal integrations in humans which involve reflection . The dog gives us particularly good examples of this type of action . The sex calls and danger cries of animals are other specific examples which involve the attitudinal type of behavior . If the sign or symbol situations were taken as indicative of attitudes , this would not necessarily limit attitude to a social category , although in general these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the ones in which the social psychologist would be interested . However , should other than social behavior fall under this attitudinal category , there would seem to be no good reason for not considering it as such . Of course , a limitation of attitude to behavior integrations around a social object , value , or motif , would make it an exclusively social category . Some would wish further to limit attitudes to the integrations concerning the major social objects or functions . This is a matter for agreement by investigators , but the present practice seems to favor a wider use of the term . In regard to such a limit as " status fixing , " it is difficult to see why it should be introduced . Although attitudinal behavior often affects status , still there are quite obviously attitudes which do not appreciably affect our status except in the sense that any behavior conditions the rest of behavior . Also , status is affected by considerably more than attitudinal behavior. // By way of summary , attitudes may be regarded as behavior integrations ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and values . It does not follow that attitudes are elementary for sociology or social psychology , although they would be of much social importance . They have in them , in gen eral , some reflective or anticipatory processes . They are com plexes of behavior which in humans may include tendencies , habits , experiences , desires , motives , ideas , associated or organized around the object of the attitude . Our behavior toward an object is the attitude in expression , in action . The more fully we get into action , the more completely is attitude disclosed . The study and analysis is primarily a study in prediction , based upon the study of such action data , which includes the total acts , as we can secure for purposes of prediction . A particular characteris tic of such prediction often is the fact that a person has never been in such a situation before , and we must judge of his atti tude toward an hypothetical or proposed situation by actions in similar past situations and by other criteria which help show what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted response is different from our prediction of it from his attitude , then we have misjudged his attitude or it has been changed or inhibited . Park and Burgess 29 have in a suggestive manner discussed the mutations of attitudes , particularly in relation to the positive or negative approaching or withdrawing behavior which generally seems to characterize attitude . 4 . TENDENCIES TO SUBJECTIVITY IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY Since our discussion of attitude has brought further into the foreground the problem of " subjective " experience , we may now turn to an analysis of this question . When it comes to a final analysis , most of the social psychologists have a place in their system for a subjective category . There are several different tendencies in regard to the subjective . ( I ) It is denied existence , at least as a subject of scientific // investigation . Since this view denies the existence of the prob lem , we can hardly look in this direction for much help in its solution . It will be unnecessary to discuss this view . There are few who hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get much headway . Experience has carried much heavier denials than this one . There are those who take a dualistic position of one kind or another . This group contains the major portion of the present-day social psychologists . The particular brand of dualism varies from interpreter to interpreter . At one extreme are those who regard the subjective as distinctly separate from and unconnected with the trans-subjective , at least from a methodological and scientific standpoint . And back of any method is a metaphysical assumption . Recognized , denied or unrecognized , it is there . This does allow for some study of the subjective , but since it is such a disconnected thing the position is nearest to that of denial . At the other extreme are those who merely regard the subjective as a special field of phenomena isolated from objective observa tion but nevertheless a part and parcel of our universe and sub ject to causal relations as is the rest of our world . There is a third tendency closely related to the last , which attempts to bring the " subjective " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as objective phenomena , not as isolated from observation . It approaches the problem as a study of action or behavior . Pitirim Sorokin 30 has taken up the cudgels for the extreme dualistic position . Since his exposition of this conception is so clear-cut and so neatly contains at least a part of its own refuta tion , his conception may well be used to illustrate the main points of this tendency . He regards the subjective ? ideas , motives , emotions , desires , wishes , etc. ? as the field of the psychic . This subjective is to be regarded as causally disconnected from the trans-subjective . " We may try to study a parallelism . . . but without claiming to make one series the cause or effect of the // other . " 31 The subjective is to be studied by introspection , and the trans-subjective by the method of natural science . But , " The intrusion of either of the parties into the field of the other one is scientifically fruitless . " It is interesting to speculate on what sort of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be studied , but not as causally related to the things desired . It is scientifically fruitless to claim a causal relation between an orange and my desire for it , my idea of an automobile and overt behavior . If I attend a banquet the social scientist is not to see any causal rela tion between my thoughts and this overt activity . To anyone accustomed to regard our knowledge as a result of sequential and recurrent relations between phenomena , such a position will seem a curious one , to say the least . One might be tempted to think that he had misinterpreted , if the position were not so definitely and insistently stated . But Professor Sorokin takes a deliberate position . However , in his zeal as apologist for introspection he counters his own position , for " Even when we study some trans-subjective phenomena , for instance a writing , a book , speech-reactions , paint ings , music , ceremonies , and other symbolical ' stimuli and reac tions , we must be introspectivists to understand their meaning and , to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no causal relations between these phenomena and thought , why introspect ? And how can one get a meaning without some sort of connection between the things and the thoughts about them ? And later he says : " What , from a behaviorist standpoint , is de-scribed as a certain change in the movement of our muscles and secretion of glands , from the inner standpoint is described as lust , ' or fear , ' or jealousy . ' " This is a curious statement , if there is no connection . This seems much the same as saying that what from an objective standpoint is wood , stone , glass , paint and nails arranged in a certain way is from the inner standpoint // called a " house . " Taking such a position puts us into great dif-ficulty because cells of a particular quality and arranged in a particular way are from an inner standpoint called " muscles , " protoplasms of particular constituency and arrangements are from an inner standpoint called " cells , " and so on , until all of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of science is one grand introspective spree . There are few social psychologists who take such an extreme position as the one just described , nor does it seem to have much to support it . As a matter of fact , most social psychologists who accept the subjective are mainly concerned in showing causal rela-tions between thoughts , desires and wishes , etc. , and more overt behavior . In fact , one of the most serious objections to the use of these categories has been the use of them as too efficient causal processes , whereas they are more properly regarded as re-sults and as links in a causal chain rather than as " the " causes . Another group of subjectivists regard social psychology as a subjective study . Thomas and Znaniecki define it as a study of attitudes or the subjective side of culture . Faris ' position is simi-lar ? he regards introspection as an important method of study.33 One could continue citations . The question arises , What is in-volved in the phenomena of social psychology which has induced so many of the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely upon introspection as such an important method of social psychology ? It is thought that the desires , wishes , motives go on inside individuals and that they are unobservable except to the individual in whom they occur . Thus , reliance must be placed upon intro-spection to disclose these phenomena . At best only some outward signs of these subjective experiences can be objectively checked . // Since one important tenet of the scientific method is the check and agreement of different observers , they are thus out of the range of natural science ? they are subjective , not objective . Be havior " ism " also has helped to force social scientists into this anomalous position . Some have advocated definitions of behavior which do not allow a consideration of such phenomena . Others by treatment or by definition give an inadequate basis for the con consideration of them.34 It should be quite clear that a denial of , or even an hypothesis which arbitrarily ignores , certain phases of experience will never be satisfactory except as a one-sided expla nation of behavior . Are such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servable , not subject to check and verification by observers and hence out of the range of the method of natural science ? The view that they are rests upon the epistomological assumption that we know things immediately and directly , and further that we ob serve directly with our senses . Observation is not a direct re sponse of the eye or ear or hand , but is based upon the responses also of a great mass of previous habits , bodily responses , move ments , etc . We observe with our whole past of psychological experience , with all of our responses , including muscles , glands , viscera and other responding mechanisms of the body . Were not this great mass of responding apparatus at hand , with its previ ously acquired residual and auxiliary responses , we would not see or hear or observe what we do . In this connection it is well to emphasize that always we see from some standpoint , some frame of reference or base of observation . A key , then , to how we " know " and observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observing or knowing responses have been built up , and how they operate . Since it will be pertinent here and will clarify an important trend in social psychology , the third trend mentioned above , toward social behavioristic study , it will be well worth a short consideration . Some writers , such as Mead , Dewey , // Markey , Holt , Watson , Lashley and Dashiell , 35 have particularly emphasized in one way or another the objective character of such so-called subjective processes as ideas , desires , motives , and reasoning . The following explanation will place some of the es sential features of the processes involved before us . The explana tion , as will be seen , is a social behavioristic one ; but behavior is not limited to the overt , it includes all action of social organisms . Social psychologists are beginning to recognize some of the importance of one individual playing or taking the role of another person . This has been emphasized particularly by some of the previously mentioned writers ; also by Cooley and Faris , and by Weiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of the perhaps most significant facts in this connection have not been realized by many social students . The point is , that it is in this process that meaning and knowing , or reflective ob servation , arise in human behavior . The reason for this lies in the possibility for the " meaning " of a stimulus , or an act , or an object , to appear in relation to what has followed or preceded , or what does consistently follow or precede it in sequential connec tion with it . Were it not for the fact that events occur in sequen tial and recurrent order , we would be unable to know . This proposition should be quite evident . The meaning of a pen is the processes and acts which have culminated in it , as well as the consequences , acts , etc. , which follow in connection with it . The meaning of paper is similarly given , as is the meaning of acts and gestures . // Now the crucial point is how " meaning , " reflective observa tion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the fact that people are and have been in social interaction in which se quential actions are involved , one person responding to another and completing the other 's actions . Since the human being has been able to develop interchangeable stimuli , he can by this means perform in a substitute manner the act of the other person , par ticularly those acts most closely associated with his own responses and which represent a completion of his own responses . The vocal act probably was the first act which was interchanged . Such substitution and interchange gives representatives of both sides of the action and potential meaning sequence , within the behavior system of the person . He is able to indicate to himself the meaning of his own act by using a stimulus which stands for the action of the other person , which action is also a comple tion of his own act . His own act similarly explains the other 's behavior . In other words ? and this is the point to which we have been leading ? he is reflectively observing what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be interpolated at this point . There is no intention to give the impression that the person clearly sees what the process is that he is going through when he thus reflec tively observes his social and physical world . As a matter of fact , we have in general been quite unaware of the process where-by we are able to know.37 It has been only in more recent years , after the study of the social sciences was well under way , that we have begun to see more clearly these social relationships in volved in the development of knowledge , ideas , and reflective observation . All observation apparently is through this framework which in its essence consists in the employment of interchangeable social stimuli , symbols , words , and gestures , in response to acts and things . We get to know what a chemical or an apple or an idea // or thinking is by exactly this same method of observation . We observe a desire , a wish , or a motive either in ourselves or in others by the same method that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain . Thinking is a process that develops between people . We observe it by the same process as that by which we observe , for example , a stream in a river bed . With proper technique we can examine another person 's thinking just as we can examine the contents of a river . The fact that we may not know what a man is thinking at a certain time is not a valid objection to the proposition that we can know and observe his thinking . It would also be impossible to observe every drop of water in a river ? we analyze it in samples . For instance , we never yet have analyzed and observed satisfactorily the composition of the blood as it travels in the veins . Whenever we get it under analysis it is in an unnatural state ; yet we do not think of the circulation as a subjective but as an objective and observable fact , even though we have not as yet examined all of its details . We do observe thinking and ideas , and observers will agree , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at any time . We must have proper conditions here , as anywhere . This is not a problem peculiar to the observation of thinking . For instance , such a simple thing as analyzing soil has many of the same difficulties as the analysis of thinking . The soils expert gets his sample . But before analysis can be carried out , temperature can not be held constant , moisture changes occur , bacterial changes may take place , chemical compounds may change form . When it is analyzed , it is not the " same " soil which he took from the ground , but a soil which has gone through those changes which the soils analyst was unable to stop or control . The observation of physical phenomena often requires very exact and careful preparation for observation to be even partially successful . Likewise , to observe thinking we must obtain favorable conditions . If a social psychologist were to live with a person from birth , observe all of the person 's experiences , etc. , there hardly could be doubt that he would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this person like a book . He could predict the person 's thought process ? would know the person so well that he would be able , as it were , to read the other person 's mind . In actual practice this is done right along by people well acquainted with another person . Likewise , thinking is observed under ordinary circumstances , especially by persons more skilled in observation . And competent observers do agree . The fact that thinking , desires and wishes are social processes which go on between persons and acts and objects is reiterating a proposition which particularly emphasizes its objec tive and observable nature . It seems never to have occurred to some social psychologists that desires , wishes and thinking are a function of the situation as a whole . Such an analysis of the development of knowledge and re flective observation makes of it an essentially behavioristic proc ess , notwithstanding some contrary " ism " definitions of behavior . An examination of the evidence points to the social-vocal-audi tory situation as the situation in which the first " meaningful " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals are part of this social process called thinking , and on this account are in a position ad vantageously to observe in themselves such processes as desires , motives , wishes , and the like ? This is quite true , but it must be emphasized again that this method of observation is exactly the same kind of observation that the individual uses in observing airplanes , thunderstorms , sunsets , or what not . Let us take this type of self-observation and briefly see what it may contain for social psychology . We are not using the word introspection here because of its historical implication of " direct " knowing and " direct " observation . When a person has observed wishes or desires or some part of his thinking process , then , since knowledge and observation rest upon social confirmation and corroboration ( and it is no mere accident that the scientific method which has grown up out of experience also requires the corrobora144 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY tion of different observers ) , the person seeks through symbolization a social medium , and through talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation . This interchange is a part of his process of observation , not something ab extra . This social interchange , all would agree , is something that competent observers can observe . The verbal report and speech reactions can thus be accepted by all parties as " objective . " But what of the report itself ? There are two means of attack . It may be regarded as responses to be analyzed in causal and functional relations with other behavior . We may attempt to discover how it checks up with other action and experience . We are still on so-called " objective " ground . Or the verbal report may be accepted at " face value , " the symbols being taken as evidence that the events which they symbolize have actually occurred to the person verbalizing . The next step , then , is for other persons to repeat the condition and observe the results . For no matter how positive the self-observer is , no one accepts even the " face value " unless other self-observers obtain or have obtained a similar result . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science or even common sense can deal with it . What are we doing in this procedure but following the exact method which is used in so-called objective observation ? If we are observing a tree , each observes the tree through his own eyes and his " social " apperceptive mass . When people are observing an event which occurs in the behavior system of each , it is also by each observing through his own responses and his " social " apperceptive mass . There is one difference . This is in the event , not in the method of observation . The tree event is theoretically one event observed by several observers , while the self-observed events are theoretically several similar events observed by several observers . But the degree of check and certainty is similarly arrived at and similarly observed in both cases . " Natural " scientists perform separate observations of separate similar events right along . But even after this procedure has either denied or // corroborated the possible face value of the event , we must make some sort of analysis of the functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis that was mentioned as the first means of attack . For , after all , in order to understand the event , its func tional and sequential relationships must be gone into as in all branches of knowledge . If someone wishes to call some of the above introspection , he may do so , but it deserves a more accurate name . Also it is a type of study which is useful in social psychology . It probably is some such process of self-observation that Cooley 39 and Faris // have in mind . But this type of observation must be clearly differentiated from the traditional introspection which assumed " direct " knowledge and direct observation , as if we observed except through the previously acquired basis and framework . I am speaking of something more fundamental than the " training " of the introspectionist . This traditional assumption has led psychologists to believe that they could discover psychological processes by " directly " looking inward , rather than by indirect examination and by attention to the causal , sequential and mechanical relationships involved . Of course we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or direct methods of knowing , for they would be a boon if discovered ; but for the present we must put reliance upon the method described above . Assuming that we consider this type of self-observation legitimate , the manner in which it may serve scientific investigation becomes an important consideration . While the method of observation may be the same , the event lies so close to personal interests , emotions , and sentiments that we have found it necessary to apply careful methods of checking and to be especially on guard against these biases . The assumption of " direct " observation leads us at once unguarded into these snares . W. F. Ogburn has pointed out the tendencies to rationalize , compensate , and build defense mechanisms in the field of social study.40 The way in which such self-observational study may have a modicum of value , as was pointed out , is to place the emphasis upon a functional and causal study of the factors sequentially associated with these phenomena , and upon check by other observers . It // seems that at best such self-observational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it must be said that there is much more to the process of knowing these phenomena than this method alone reveals . After all , the way we come to know what desires , motives , wishes , and such phenomena , are ? their strength , characteristics , and relations ? is by observing people in action , by being in action ourselves and by developing observing responses in experience with others . Of course , some of this is self-observation . But many social psychologists have only half realized the proposition so cogently expounded by Cooley , that we see even ourselves in the actions of those around us , those responding to us . We literally see through other eyes . It is in these social relationships and people 's social behavior that we learn to know what desires , motives , etc. , are . It is quite naive to assume that one is going to understand them simply by " introspecting . " A social psychology written by this kind of " self-observation " would be a curious production . But if one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as social psychologists , have used this method with little check quite extensively . To be sure , one must think , but verbal and symbolic activity is not to be confused with self-observation in its ordinary meaning . Some one may object that if a person were unable to feel and have emotions , he would be unable to understand other people . This is quite true , but neither would he " know " anything else . The statement holds with full force for our physical world as well as for social events . What are our conclusions regarding subjective tendencies ? The so-called subjective is observable by competent observers . It is to be studied as any other natural science is to be studied . Desires , motives , wishes are capable of the same kind of objective treatment . We get to know and observe feelings , desires , etc. , literally in the actions of other people . The so-called subjective is rather non-subjective , a social process between people , and is understood only in these relations . One will apparently come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may help , but by looking without at the behavior of others and the behavior of oneself in relation to others . Desires , motives , wishes , and ideas are not processes merely inferred into persons ' behavior , but objective realities . There is no objective to the word " subjective " when properly used , but in this connection it is misleading and erroneous on account of the implication of things unobservable and not amenable to objective check . As social psychologists come to realize the objective , observable and behavioristic nature of these phenomena , then this study may hope to become more of a science of objection material and less like a literature where one man 's opinion is as good as another 's , with the lack of agreement that always prevails when information comes unchecked from the student 's " subjective " experience . The above point of view is in direct contradiction to the tendency previously mentioned which arbitrarily separates trans-subjective behavior in a disconnected fashion from desires , wishes , ideas , etc . It is a method of studying experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . THE FALLACY OF THE " GROUP FALLACY " We have been tracing trends away from individualistic and subjective to social and behavioristic interpretations of the responses of persons and personalities . There is , however , another phase running counter to this general trend which requires consideration . It is a direct broadside against the group and other conceptions of the sociologists which are taken by them as units of analysis . This view would have the individual gobble up the group , the institution , and other collective forms of response . All we have , according to it , is an aggregate of individuals ? but they are a remarkably stuffed and over-fat collection . However , in this shape they are taken to show that the group is a fallacy . It is only the individuals that are the units of scientific investigation . There are not many who hold such an extreme view ; but // there are considerably more who may verbally agree that a group is something more than the sum of the individuals but who , nevertheless , ignore this fact in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conception still has considerable in fluence . Floyd H. Allport , at a recent meeting of the American Sociological Society , has maintained that the conceptions of " group " and " institution " are incompatible with a natural science approach to social phenomena , if we take them as denoting ob jects to be studied . ' Those who have found the preceding sections convincing will need no further discussion of the points developed there in order to realize that the group unity is a fact and that the group exists as an object of study by the natural scientific method . However , it may be useful to summarize some of the main points indicative of the validity of the group as a unit of study . No special at-tempt is made to go into detail in taking up the points against the group concept proposed by specific papers , such as Allport 's , since it is assumed that these objections will be taken care of in a straightforward discussion of the positive aspects of the con ception. ( r ) The group is a reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth this position clearly and convincingly.42 But even Allport does not deny that the group is real , 43 so this point need not detain us. ( 2 ) Groups are integrations of social interaction . The unity of the group must be looked for in interconnected and interde pendent systems of social action . At no place in his paper does Allport , for example , define what he means by the group or the group concept . It is quite evident that he does not under-stand by the term what most sociologists understand by it . How150 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY ever , those sociologists who describe sociology as a study of the group and of culture are also prone , almost unwittingly on account of this division , to think of the group as a collection of biological organisms rather than to think of groups as existing in the interactions and inter-relations which go to make up culture . Such a division represents a most crude conception of the group . It is not the biological organisms as such , but their interconnected action which makes a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function of the group 's existence , and culture exists at least in an elementary form in all groups . How much or what part of this culture is passed on is another problem . On the other hand , culture does not exist outside of a group formulation . A full study of group behavior must include the study of culture . If some arbitrarily limit the term cultural to the " man made " or the human social heritage , this would not alter the above statement . ( 3 ) The group or institution represents a distinct level of objects in our universe . The action composing the group does not exist outside the group , it does not exist in the individuals as such , but only in individuals as part of a group . Conversely , the individual gets his existence as a person only as a member of a group . It should not take a great deal of study to disclose the fact that if groups were destroyed the individuals would perish also ; I mean much more than physical destruction ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , and all other human characteristics in human groups , and the corresponding relations in other animal groups . Perhaps Allport 's most serious error is transferring group phenomena into isolated individuals . The individuals of whom he writes are fictitious outside of a group formulation . ( His position is similar to one which maintains that water exists in separate H and 0 atoms. ) ( 4 ) We respond explicitly to the group . To show this we could give illustration after illustration . A child responds to his play group . He will respond to his family group . He responds differently to a person when alone than when in a group . // A person will respond to his social group by the customary and conventional acts . To say that all he is responding to is indi viduals is to miss the essential nature of the stimulus . We observe a group explicitly and implicitly just as all scientists observe all phenomena . None observe totally explicitly or implicitly , but by an admixture of the two . Laws and formulations of group behavior are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cooley , Thomas , Park , Burgess , Ross , Ellwood , Ogburn , and others . These are formu lations which are characteristic of group phenomena and which do not characterize individuals as such . The study of the group as a natural object requires its own frame of reference which is different from that ordinarily employed by the social psychologist and still further removed from that of the psychologist . It is not surprising that psycholo gists , when looking for the group with an inadequate frame of reference or basis of observation , should fail to find a very satis factory formulation of the group and group phenomena . All-port , for instance , in his discussion employs the psychologists ' frame of reference , which is a basis for the observation of the individual as an individual unit and not one for the observa tion of the group . It is something like looking for an elephant with a microscope . IV . SOME INFLUENCE FROM RELATED FIELDS In the previous sections there have been discussed some sig nificant aspects of the current emphasis upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to impor tant sociological and anthropological influences , the trend toward a more objective and natural scientific method of analysis 4a in social psychology has been influenced markedly by developments in various closely allied studies , some of which , if not in name , // are in fact , studies in social psychology . Some of these devel opments will be pointed out . We already have pointed out one of the most serious weak nesses of behaviorism , its inadequate treatment of reflective be havior and the social relations connected with it . However , be haviorism 45 and the behavioristic method have had a remarkable influence upon social psychology and the social sciences . If this approach can be shorn of its " ism " or clique characteristics and adopted as a method of study , it may continue to be of immense value . Particularly will it be valuable to state desires , wishes , motives , and the so-called subjective , in terms of behavior . The trend in this direction seems due for a large expansion . Watson 's position in his Ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific social psychology . The study of the social behavior of individuals and of personality is giving increasing attention to the behavioristic approach . Associated with this approach , a conception which has proved most useful is that of the conditioned reflex and conditioned re sponse contributed by the Russian school of objective and be havioristic psychology , by Pavlov 46 in particular . This already has had a remarkable influence upon American behaviorists , psychologists , social psychologists and sociologists . It has proved its worth . We undoubtedly will make much more use of it in the future . It has furnished further mechanistic basis for learn ing and for psychological processes . There has , however , been a tendency to take conditioned re sponse in too absolute and complete a manner . While we know that conditioning goes on , it is still our problem to discover how it takes place , particularly in the more complex type of learning . We also must be cautious about the too complete acceptance of conditioned response as an explanation of learning . ConfiguraTRENDS // tionists , integrationists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning has too often carried the implication of only a mechanical substitution when conditioning occurs . In behavior and in the process of conditioning we must allow for integration of a more complex nature . But even quite complex and " meaningful " behavior must be regarded as taking place within dynamic constellations of conditioned reflex and response mechanisms . The Gestalt theorists 47 up to the present have had much less influence upon social psychology . They are insisting upon a consideration of the total action , the relation of the stimulus to its background and to the form or configuration of the response . In general , the sociologist has been insisting for some time upon a consideration of the total situation and the relation of the configurational arrangement ? for instance , Thomas and Znani ecki 's discussion of social attitudes , social values and the social situation . In other words , it seems that social psychologists have previously cashed in on much that Gestalt might have contrib uted.48 However , the Gestalt popularity should give new strength and impetus to this type of study . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviorists . They claim that it is not valid to think of a person 's habits and integrations as necessarily being built up by " piecing " together previously-formed sections of behavior . Their thesis is that new configurations occur which are not found in isolated parts . It seems necessary to modify our conception in this respect in order to allow for integrations which are more than a mere summation of parts of previous behavior but which // are " new " integrations . The work of neurologists also tends to support the idea that everything is not given at birth . Of course the potentialities exist at that time . Further , it is made clearer that a stimulus is not to be taken as existing in isolation but must be determined by experimentation and in association with related conditions . In the work of physiological psychologists , neurologists , and gland physiologists , 49 we find very important support for a mech anistic conception of human behavior . Such work as that of Loeb , Jennings , Verworn , and others have shown the importance of trophisms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sherrington , and Pavlov have developed the mechanistic aspects of highly integrated behavior in a very suggestive manner . Lashley , Watson , Thorndike , and other experimental psychologists have given particular attention to the learning processes . The work of Cannon , Kempf , Crile , and others has served to bring to the foreground the importance of glands and visceral func tions in human behavior . Social psychology has benefited tre mendously from the work of those not even primarily interested in social behavior . The advances in this knowledge of the working of the nerv ous system , its irritability traits , the place of chemical reactions in behavior , the influence of the glands and viscera , all have gone to show us the irrational man , one who acts not from reason and logic but from reflexes , glandular activity , etc . The system of psychology which bounced this irrational character into the fore-front of discussion was that resulting from the work of Freud and his followers , along with the work of other psycho-analysts , // psychiatrists , alienists , and abnormal psychologists.60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rational man , " or the " economic man , " who reasons out what is best for everybody and then acts accordingly , we find persons acting from reasons often unknown or unrecognized and giving themselves and others clever " rationalizations " of why they did this or that . Of course this does not mean that man never acts rationally . One of the healthiest influences upon social psychology has been the study of abnormal psychology . Here we discover that the traits which appear in exaggerated form in the abnormal are of the same kind that appear in normal beings . We find that all people are somewhat crazy or abnormal . While abnormality often is caused by organic disorders , it also is often the result of a social maladjustment . This study emphasizes , too , that there always are deterministic reasons for a person 's behavior being what it is . However , in this connection the psycho-analysts have put themselves under heavy liability for their auto-egoistic and individualistic interpretations of social phenomena , and also for their great emphasis upon such mysterious entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classed as highly subjective in some respects , it has contributed to a greater func tional and causal insight into behavior . Even the instinctivist school , to which many psycho-analysts would belong , reinforces in certain ways a mechanistic and functional conception of human behavior . Social psychology seems to be due for much growth in connection with abnormal psychology and psychiatry . The whole effect of mechanistic and objective tendencies is to give us a causal and functional conception of human behavior , to see in it the working out of functional sequences and dependent relationships and not of caprice , chance and accident . It leads the social scientist to a personal attitude not of blaming or calling // things " good " or " bad , " but of understanding and discovering the causes and reasons for human behavior , rational and irra tional . Two other important influences upon social psychology should be indicated . One is that of child study , and the other is that of psychological tests . Child study is so intimately tied up with psychology and social psychology that we already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source . Space is too limited to give it the additional special treatment that it deserves . " Only some points regarding psychological tests will be mentioned . In order to determine behavior , actual and potential , a large number of such tests have been devised . These tests are all special tests , although some do attempt general testing by cover ing various types of skill . Some are accepted purely as special performance tests , but a large number are used to generalize upon skill or ability not tested directly ; especially is this true in regard to heredity . The so-called intelligence tests often are considered as testing innate intelligence . In so far as the tests are used for the purpose of testing innate intelligence , their results would not be primarily social but psychological . But in so far as they measure the acquirement of skills and influences which are a func tion of social interaction , their results would be primarily social psychological . Now it has never been proved that these tests do test innate intelligence , since they measure at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acquired mechanisms . No test so far has been devised which will test with one of these variables held constant , although it is often assumed that environmental factors are constant . The persons making such assumptions often have made only a most casual and general study of the environ ment and are not specialists in the influence of environment , as one would naturally expect of them before they made such an // assumption . On the contrary , we find that , as a rule , the more familiar one becomes with the environmental influence , the more critical he becomes of making the assumption of a common en vironment even in its quite elementary aspects . The influences in early childhood which numerous writers and investigators have emphasized as being very potent in determining later tendencies often are lost sight of . Watson , in his investigations concern ing child behavior , has placed particular importance upon the de-termination of character by early habits and influences . Not only do we have persons ignoring these environmental factors , but we find them correlating intelligence tests with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and because they naturally find a correlation , they assume it to be due to heredity even after thus stacking or " fixing " their variables . The comparison is quite legitimate , but the conclusions can not be decisive for heredity ; Such a conclusion goes beyond the data . What the correlation gives is that the higher score goes with the higher economic advantage , and vice versa , and not necessarily that the higher score goes with higher heredity . This is yet to be determined . Even giving subsequent tests to the same person does not hold heredity strictly constant , although it does eliminate some variable factors . In this connection , Frank Freeman has reported some very interesting studies on foster children , showing the increase in intelligence scores when chil dren were placed in a more favorable home environmental Besides hereditary influences , there are also organic influences which are measured by these tests , in addition to social influences and social training . However , when intelligently and critically used , these tests furnish us with some very valuable information concerning group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses to particular social stimuli and situations . We will turn now to a consideration of the specific field of phenomena with which social psychology is concerned . // V. A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY There has been some dispute as to whether social psychology properly belongs with sociology or psychology . The psycholo gists often have regarded the sociologist as too unfamiliar with psychological information and technique , which they have re garded as essential to an understanding of social psychology . If we look at the contribution of psychologists to our knowledge of the results of social influences upon the individual , their claim as represented by this is a very impressive one . The contributions in personality study , the study of the " self , " abnormal behavior , and of other social responses are truly imposing . Such names as James , Angell , Dewey , Watson , Calkins , Wundt , Mi.insterburg , Woodworth , etc. , those of the mental testers , psychiatrists , Freudians , abnormal psychologists , and child psychologists call to mind some of their contributions . Some psychologists go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses of one after another of the individuals of a group ; therefore sociology itself is only an extended study of individual psychology . In any case , they would say the study of social psychology is merely the study of the individual under social influences . Sociologists , on the other hand , charge the psychologist with not being sufficiently familiar with social influences , group be havior and social situations ; further , that the habitual bent of the psychologist is toward uncovering individual uniformities rather than the effect of social influences , and that this attitude is often inimical to a rounded study of the social behavior of indi viduals . Some sociologists 53 state that all the individual psychol ogists can give us is the form of the response of individuals to social situations ; that it remains for the social psychologist to study the particular responses ( attitudes ) in relation to social situations ( values ) . Their point is that psychology attempts to formulate laws which are valid for all individuals everywhere , whereas social psychology studies the responses of individuals as // controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be valid for all individuals but only for those having certain relations to these social situations . Other sociologists go further and claim complete independence from psychology . For instance , Wallis 54 recently put forward what has been regarded by some as a convincing statement of the view . His main con tention is that it is legitimate to select any part of reality as a unit of study ; he holds also that " individual psychology is not a guide to the behavior of the group " and particularly not a guide to cultural traits . While different fields of scientific knowledge seem to be mov ing closer together , still for methodological purposes a division of labor seems essential . Perhaps the most satisfactory differentia tion between sciences is to be found in the frames of reference through which they view phenomena . Without a consistent frame of reference , uniformities are not accurately observed and laws generalized . At best , one gets only a running descriptive account . Since all three ? psychology , social psychology , and soci ology ? aim to be nomological sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpful . One frame of reference takes the individual organism as its unit and studies its behavior . This is the generally accepted frame of reference of psychology . The neurologist studies the behavior of nerves as such , but this is a still different frame of generalization . Psychology takes the total nervous system and endeavors to study its behavior as an organic unit . It is inter ested in establishing universally valid laws of the behavior of or ganisms in general , and for particular species ? the human , the rat , etc . This might adequately be called physiological psychology . Another frame of reference is to take as a unit of analysis the response of the individual as a functional part of a social situation . Here the attempt is no longer to generalize for all persons , but to generalize for certain relationships between re sponses and situations . Psychology can tell us that all humans // vocalize , but social psychology tells us that in a certain situation one will vocalize Chinese ; in another , Spanish ; in another , Ger man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , a combination . Indi vidual psychology as such could only generalize regarding the form of the behavior ; social psychology gives the more specific functional relationship and content . Thomas and Znaniecki , as previously mentioned , have dis cussed some phases of these two viewpoints . Weiss makes a division into the bio-physical response and the bio-social response . The bio-physical response determines the typical behavior of the individual as an organism . Weiss emphasizes that the bio-social response , however , is to be understood only in its social setting . ' Kimball Young points out that social psychology studies the con-tent of social responses . It is quite evident that the psychologist who is used to taking the individual as a unit is likely to have some difficulty in becom ing a social psychologist . Often he never makes a shift in his frame of reference . Allport , as we have noticed , looking through these spectacles , never has been able adequately to grasp the fact that there is a group or an institution . It is doubtful whether many social psychologists have clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in frame of reference is required . Watson has changed his emphasis so that he sees no difference between psychology , social psychology , and sociology . This lands him rather close to the social psychologist 's position , although I have nowhere seen him recognize this clearly . There is another difficulty into which the psychologist gets . Since he generalizes for the individual , he tends continually to attribute to the individual organism , hereditary and other influ ences which the social psychologist finds to be due to the social situation . This is quite natural , since some phenomena , when abstracted from social life , are inexplicable . The psychologist // does the easy thing and calls these the result of heredity . For example , some even see morality or criminality as inherited traits . The sociologist , on the other hand , takes the group as an integration , not of mere organisms , as some psychologists seem to think , but as an integration of parts of behavior into groups or complex social action . The group , as we have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals in mutual interrelation , but not in individuals separate from this interrelation , i.e. , we can never cut the group up into pieces and still have left the group . Sociology generalizes the laws of the processes of collective or group behavior , the formation , change and interaction of social groups and group acts . It studies these processes in both time and space . This includes the study of culture.5s If these three frames of reference be accepted as those of the three disciplines under discussion , Wallis ' plea for the independence of social psychology turns out to be one for the independence of sociology . Here it has much more validity than it would for social psychology , accepting as the latter 's basis of reference the responses of individuals to social situations . Since in this case individuals do the responding , a knowledge of psychology appears essential to an adequate understanding of these processes . Of course one might study some limited aspect with slight psychological knowledge , but one has a limited knowledge when finished . While this may be legitimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to draw upon psychology and even neurology and physiology . In fact , psychology might be regarded as divided into physiological psychology and social psychology . Balz " goes further and calls all psychology , social psychology . IIe thus has ignored the frames of reference involved so that his position is not strictly // valid , although he does well to emphasize the dominant influence of social life . To go to the other extreme with K. Young , and call group study the main field of social psychology , does not agree with sound methodology or prevalent practice . Does it seem likely that social psychology will become a di-vision of general psychology as it might logically ? There are at least two difficulties in the way . First , a knowledge of sociology is just as essential as is a knowledge of psychology ; and an ap proach from the group viewpoint has considerable advantage . Second , the psychologists have in general shown a lack of under-standing of sociology . In order to become first-rate social psy chologists , they must be well oriented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social psychologists have demonstrated a greater mastery of psychology . For example , some of the best-informed social psychologists in the country , such as L. L. Bernard , Ellsworth Faris , and Kimball Young , are sociologists . A further question may be raised at this point . Is social psychology limited to a study of the human animal ? Theo retically , there seems to be no valid reason for so limiting it . " Such students as Aliport , Ellwood , Gault , and Giddings would extend it to the wider study . Comparative study of animals is a profitable enterprise , as the work of Kohler , Wheeler , Alverdes , McGee , Kropotkin , Espinas , and others well demonstrates . But since the field is so broad and since the human aspects appeal to our anthropocentric interests , it is probable that human social psychology will continue to obtain the lion 's share of attention . However , comparative study is bound to receive more considera tion . If the preceding discussion is convincing , social psychology may take its place as a natural science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fallacy of the group fallacy , we have set forth propositions showing it to meet the tests of a natural science . Its phenomena are observable and objective , in // common with all sciences . It is true that we still lack a technique as well developed as some of the other sciences have acquired . We still have persons who are naive enough to believe they can write social psychology by random observation , anecdotes , and a little logic ? a thing that one can not do in physics , for instance . Nevertheless , sufficient pseudo-science is written in the " natural " sciences to remind one of glass houses , and there is a sufficiently large body of careful work in social psychology to make us hope ful for the future . It will be possible for social psychology to make some salvage from instinctive traits , desires , wishes , attitudes , and even the " sacred subjective , " along the lines that have already been in dicated . The task is that of observing the functional , sequential , and mechanistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something upon which to rely as explanations . This I think will lead to a study of what Mead has called the complex social act . The social act depends for its existence upon individuals in interaction . The task of the social psychologist is to study the responses in these complex social acts . Znaniecki 's proposition that the social act may represent a relatively closed system , therefore a more satisfactory process in which to formu late social psychological laws , is well worth careful consideration . One may accept this conception , however , without agreeing with his extraordinarily rationalistic definition and analysis of social acts themselves . This goes so far in his treatment that he at times seems to deny that social acts may be regarded as closed systems . While some behavior may be of the intellectualistic and rationalistic type which he assumes , social psychology would be quite incomplete and inadequate if it did not include much more than this , for social acts are certainly not so limited . With human beings , such study quite clearly will concern itself with such complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves , " " per-sons , " " personalities , " 6 ? as well as with the study of " desire " and // " wish " complexes , social habit mechanisms , and symbols . All of these are at present receiving a great deal of attention . The study of responses as parts of complex social acts is a methodological principle of immense importance , once its significance is clearly grasped . The social person may be regarded as beginning , mediating , or ending social acts . Few acts of a person are complete in themselves . Some acts may set in motion a train of consequences running over the world . We are constantly beginning actions which we expect to be completed in this way or that . A thorough student of the situation calculates quite accurately on the result . The less careful student is more often disappointed . The practical organizer or the politician is often a keen judge of social responses to him and to other social influences . Of course , in speaking of actions which are calculated or planned , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irrational , emotional , poorly verbalized or unverbalized , traditional , conventional , and habitual . When we think of the persons ' acts as part of a larger groupact , some very interesting problems for investigation are suggested . How do these uncompleted acts fit into different groupings ? What is the effect , in transplanting them , upon habit organization or disorganization ? A whole series of other questions pertinent for social control and social organization readily come to mind . In this connection , there is a large field , almost untouched , concerning the making and changing of habits by social means . Our habit clinics should be of greater use in this respect . Also there is the field of child training and the social control of the child . With the rapidly growing number of institutes , something more may be expected along this line . In regard to changing habits , putting special attention upon the " means whereby " the " end " may be obtained seems a very suggestive attack . Since the " end " stimulus may tend to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve another // type of action in the situation ; whereas attention upon " means " or intermediate steps can bring one out at a different " end " with-out so much difficulty . F. M. Alexander , in Man 's Supreme Inheritance , 60 has given some suggestive material along this line . But a social psychological analysis is needed to show the relation of social influences to the achievement of the " means whereby . " Also , since symbolic mechanisms make possible an intelligent and planned control of people and situations , it is of great impor tance to get as much insight into their operation as possible . A stimulating question to ask , as Todd does , 61 is how far we may be carried by this means . It is evident that symbolic mechanisms built up in the process of natural evolution will become of much greater significance in social organization and social life generally . A study of responses to sign and symbol situations will repay greater consideration.62 In this connection there are rich findings in store for the investigator of the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such integrations . Of particular interest are the materials of psychiatry dealing with compulsions , fears , complexes , symbolization , and similar phenomena . The genetic aspects deserve especial consideration in this connection . The great advantage of approaching the study of social psy chology from the group angle has been mentioned several times . This opens up immediately a wide field of special social psy chologies , as , for instance , political psychology or the social psy chology of institutions , established groups and classes . This phase of study has been poorly developed in America.63 It will // also be clear from previous analysis that such special studies , to be fundamentally sound , will regard individual social responses as functions of the social situation . In this connection , the social situations involved in the basic economic classes and groups are of particularly deterministic and wide importance . A study of responses in class " consciousness , " race " consciousness , " occupational reactions , occupational types , labor psychology , capitalistic psychology , radical and conservative reactions , and conditions which give rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , will yield very valuable scientific information on social behavior . The responses of persons in other social processes and forms of interaction , such as cooperation , conflict , and competition , need much more detailed analysis . In regard to the group orientation , we may well give greater attention to the normal or usual behavior and to conditioning that occurs under these more ordinary influences and group situations . It is as necessary to uncover the regular responses as it is the abnormal or unusual . Such study is of especial importance in the infant period . In addition to the above , there is also the comparison of responses between individuals , giving us distributions and statistical curves of various sorts ? the many psychological tests , for example ? or , for instance , such work as Thurstone 's attempt at measuring attitudes.64 It seems to me that frequency scatter // diagrams allowing for at least two dimensional scales , or variables , are more hopeful for an analytical study of attitude than a one-scale chart , for attitudes often have opposing or conflicting elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be helpful to allow for numerous attitudinal components . Special attention should be paid to the possibility of curvilinear regression . Besides this , there are other interesting beginnings in the study of typical responses and social distance . VI . THE OUTLOOK FOR SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY It seems , in general , that sciences have grown out of the problems of social life . This is also true of social psychology , which has developed out of the ever-insistent problem of understanding and controlling the behavior of persons in a world growing constantly more complex and difficult to manage . How will social psychology continue to develop under these conditions ? That the central tendency of social psychology in its more practical and applied aspects is around the problem of social control is readily seen in the many uses to which its principles are put . The applications of social psychology of course ramify throughout all social life , but one may mention a few phases which seem more closely related to this study as a discipline . Modern advertising methods have made an especially wide use of the psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have employed its principles extensively . Industry , in dealing with workers , labor unions , customers and " the public , " has made considerable use of it . Its utilization by community fund drives , by religious organizations , by civic associations in agitation for legislation , by cooperative associations , unions , and clubs , is also familiar . Under modern governmental operation the principles of social psychology have been of great political interest . Examples may be drawn from such activities as the manipulation of people by popular demagogues , and immense drive campaigns , as illustrated in the mobilization of the // martial spirit at the entrance into the last war . Its principles in press and propaganda have been employed to organize and maintain those things which are " right , " " to be respected , " and " proper , " and to get rid of troublesome ideas and movements , to stimulate heresy hunts , to sanction trade conquest , and to aid in many other ways by which the path of political enterprise is made smoother . The needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of social psychology and closely allied studies . The vogue of tests , sporadic experimental methods and similar efforts exemplify the interest here . Experimental schools are usually based in one way or another upon social psychological theories or principles . In the treatment of children in habit clinics , in juvenile delinquency cases , and in other corrective work , its principles have been employed more or less , but much remains to be done in this connection , especially in reeducative treatment , court and legal procedure , and the broad field of criminal justice . The fields of abnormal behavior and psychiatric treatment are further interesting and rather popular illustrations of the practical use and encouragement of social psychological development . Social work , since so much of its treatment deals with individuals , being practically limited to them and smaller groups , has made use of social psychology , as has been partially indicated above . Many personality conflicts , kinks , and maladjustments can be adequately handled by the social worker with an understanding of its laws . However , the social worker has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one might expect . This lack is perhaps due to the nature of social work . For in order to eliminate or change the stimuli and conditions causing maladjustment , to furnish the corrective social stimuli and take care of the causes properly , the social worker would , in most cases , have to change the social conditions which produced the maladjustments . Here he is likely to get into difficulty . Not only is he faced with the concrete task of reorganization , but // when he tries to change social conditions he often runs into the opposition of those vested interests which profit thereby . These same interests may be those which furnish funds for his work . Such a person is likely to be made short shift of as a meddler because , after all , the social worker by his very function is an administrator of the mores and standards of the dominant groups , and these often sanction the condition which he would eliminate . Hence , the ones who last are usually those who do little in a large sense to take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anesthetize or chloroform the patient in order that the fundamental causes of maladjustment may continue to operate unmolested . As long as the social worker is under such control , he will undoubtedly continue to perform this function ; and the principles of social psychology will be of less use to him than they otherwise would be in such situations . At present , his main reliance is upon those principles which enable him to pacify persons in uncomfortable positions . That part of social psychol ogy dealing with the psychology of religion may be of help to the social worker in this connection . On account of the many practical phases of social psychology , the science has had a rapid growth , although it is only in the be ginnings of its contribution to the technique of social control . Social psychology also is taking a noticeably more important place in school curricula . Courses in political psychology have recently been added to social psychology . Perhaps one significant difficulty in teaching social , and particularly political , psychology is that it may analyze too clearly the methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future politician , it may be dangerous for too many laymen to understand all of the meth ods whereby people are manipulated . It is probable that for the present the attempt at a rounded teaching of political psychology especially will be rather lopsided . Social psychological research is being encouraged , but the facilities after all are very meager.s5 // Professor Ogg 's report on opportunities for research in the humanistic sciences , presented to the American Council of Learned Societies , may be discouraging and perhaps helpful . Much of the research under way is not directly in social psychology but only goes into this aspect " by the way " or " on the side . " Much more than this is necessary . When complaints are made of the lack of experimental and other exact research , one must consider the lack of proper resources , along with the fact that a large part of the present research is supported for special purposes and special interests rather than for the development of a science . Too little of the work being done is research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still less of it is experimental work.ss As Ogburn remarks , this undoubtedly is due to the state of the science , at least in part . It also is partially due to some of the limitations inherent in social experimentation . These handicaps to experimental work in my opinion have been overrated . Numerous ones are due to social censorship , tabu , and prohibition . Especially is this true in the realm of personal experimentation if it happens to go counter to the mores and standards of the group . Experimentation in institutional changes is greatly restricted where results may be contradictory to already established organizations or when it is concerned with institutions well embedded in the mores . In spite of the fact that they are meager , we need // a comparative summary and analysis of the results of the experimentation and research which already have been completed . From such a study , conclusions and generalizations could be formulated , not because they fit a previously-made system , but because they appear from the findings themselves . This type of summary is neglected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is vital . As a science grows out of conditions , it is also conditioned by them . The problem of controlling social affairs is ever present . Hence the prospects seem fairly bright for the development of social psychology along those lines which help one person to control another , some groups to exploit other groups , and vested interests to maintain themselves . Research , teaching , and practical application concerning the development , rather than the control , of persons and personalities seem destined to lag behind or remain more of an academic interest until we are organized to run social and economic life rather than to be run by it . It is evident that a full development of social psychology waits upon a social organization for the purpose of creating and freeing persons rather than for exploiting them , but this is apparently true of social sciences generally . CHAPTER IV THE DEVELOPING STUDY OF CULTURE By Dorothy P. Gary WITH the gradual emergence of social anthropology , an inter-change of influences between this science and sociology ensued . The results of earlier impacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , but rather the trends develop ing out of their contemporary cross-fertilization . The center of common interest has shifted somewhat from social origins . The present rendezvous is that of culture , its nature and dynamics . Certainly attention to the much-needed research on culture and to comparative studies of culture is to be welcomed . But when in their fervor the self-styled " culturalists " promise or even threaten us with a new school and a new faith in the field of American sociology , it is another matter . Sociology , poor Job , has it not had sins enough visited upon its head ? Apparently not , for even now the culturalists are enthusiastically acclaiming , " Here at last is the Moses to lead sociology out of its wilderness . . . . The study of Sociology is the study of culture . " ' Just what does this statement mean ? Tylor defines culture as " that complex whole which includes knowledge , belief , art , morals , law , custom and any other capacities acquired by man as a member of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthro pologists . Very good ; but is this not just what sociologists in their innocence have thought that they were studying all along ? Is it possible that this group has overlooked the best research and theory in the field of sociology ? Since , by this definition culture is limited to human beings , 172 // the viewpoint that would define sociology as a science of culture is anthropocentric , and , what is scientifically more important , it would exclude valuable data on other animal groupings . In recent years there has been a trend toward broadening the defini tion of sociology to include not only human but all animal group ings , thus giving a basis for comparative sociology.3 A similar trend is also observable in the writings of a few anthropologists , such as Boas and Rivers . ' This more inclusive definition of the field of sociology seems to the present writer the only tenable one . However , the study of human civilizations and culture is not only a legitimate branch of sociology but probably its most important one . In summarizing the trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of the various approaches to cultural phe nomena , turning next to an examination of the various tendencies in the study of cultural change and the closely related question of social control ; concluding with a brief summary of some of the developments in the field of cultural research . Before entering into a discussion of trends , it will be well to state that it is some-what difficult to make absolutely clear-cut and consistent generali zations of such trends . Many students of culture exhibit in their writings and research rather contradictory elements , and quite a number concern themselves very little with the theoretical prob lems of their science , preferring to give their whole attention to concrete research problems . This latter is especially true of social anthropologists , the majority of whom Wissler calls " hard-headed empiricists who regard it as their job to record and describe the phenomena of culture and not be troubled with origins , processes and least of all , with laws . " ' Yet in spite of these qualifications , certain general trends in the study of culture can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give attention to individual writers in the field only in so far as they represent or illustrate certain lines of development . I. WHAT IS CULTURE ? Tylor 's definition of culture is not unlike Democracy ? gen erally accepted " in principle , " but in practice varying widely from interpreter to interpreter . To put it rather bluntly , the scientists studying culture are not agreed among themselves , except in a vague sort of way , as to the nature of the data they are studying . Since the theoretical approach to a problem largely determines methodology and therefore results ( scientifically determined facts being a function of the method employed ) , this question is of para mount importance . In interpreting the nature of cultural phe nomena , three major tendencies are discernible : a subjective , a pseudo-objective , and an objective . I. THE SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF CULTURE The subjective approach to culture follows two different and yet somewhat related routes . The first is that of the meta-physician , and the second that of the individual psychologist who makes culture mainly an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexes . Since the historians some twenty-five years ago decided " to leave God out of history , " the students of civilizations and cul ture who would interpret social phenomena in terms of soul and other supernatural forces have been rapidly on the decline until at present they are almost negligible in influence . Spengler is perhaps the most noteworthy throw-back to this earlier school of thought . His Decline of the West ' presents a queer hodge podge of mathematical theory , historical fact and obscure meta-physical reasoning . The widespread attention which his work has received is due not to its soundness of treatment but rather to the fact that Spengler has voiced the mingled fears , hopes and // apprehensions of western European civilization , demoralized by the World War and beset with internal contradictions . His book is a product of a civilization become sick and lacking faith in its ability to recover . Another type of metaphysical treatment has expressed itself in the concepts of " the group mind " and " the crowd mind , " as developed by McDougall , Le Bon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has metaphysical elements , ' although his concept of " collective representations " is far more realistic than the two previously mentioned . The concept of social or group mind enjoyed a certain vogue among sociologists for a time , but it has been largely replaced by the more scientifically-grounded concept of collective behavior integrations . A subjective treatment of cultural data which is at present of more significance is that which interprets these data in terms of individual psychology . This type of subjectivity exhibits an extensive and hardy character . Frazer , Freud , and the whole school of psycho-analysts attempt to explain culture in terms of unconscious mechanisms . ' Floyd Allport , William McDougall , and numerous other psychologists would explain culture as an expression also of the individual 's reactions and attempted adjust ment to his environment , 10 although McDougall and his followers would place more emphasis on the significance of innate uncon ditioned mechanisms of behavior . Allport , in reviewing Ogburn 's Social Change , states emphatically that scientists should concen trate on the interplay between biological and cultural factors and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole , // or culture wholly in terms of itself . . . . The individual should be considered as the unit of social change . " 11 Critics of this general position , as well as of its specific forms , are numerous and on the increase.12 The Freudian interpretation of totem and tabu and other aspects of the simpler cultures has been attacked by Wissler , Malinowski , Goldenweiser and others , as not being compatible with the facts.73 The position which All-port represents has been demolished from all sides . Since the salient points in this connection are treated in the chapter on Social Psychology in this volume , they will not be discussed here . Within the field of scientific investigation of culture , the tide of present thought seems to be sweeping well beyond any indi vidualistic basis and orienting itself more and more around col lective principles . However , there are many remnants of the older individualistic approach in the writings of American and European students of culture . Strangely enough , this holds true for many of the critics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point brings us to an analysis of the second conception of the nature of culture . 2 . THE PSEUDO-OBJECTIVE AND PARTIAL INTERPRETATION OF CULTURE The pseudo-objective tendencies in the handling of cultural data are a symptom of the quandary in which the majority of anthropologists and sociologists find themselves . They are caught // between the old and the new orientation , not being able to make the transition to a wholly objective conception of cultural phe nomena . Their practice of dealing continually with cultural data , whether of early or modern life , has inevitably brought a break with the strictly individualistic approach and a dawning compre hension of the collective character of these social phenomena . Yet because this comprehension is incomplete , the trend toward ob jectivity is likewise so . In so far as culture is viewed as a group phenomena , there is objectivity ; meanwhile , subjectivity continues to the extent that reference is made to supposed forces or tenden cies in the individual as an explanation of culture . Also to the ex-tent that culture is interpreted in terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cultural environment , the treatment is both incomplete and permeated by subjectivity . The partial character is inherent in the position itself while the subjectivity is due to these scientists ' comprehension of psychol ogy and behavior as subjective phenomena and not , of course , to the subjective character of the phenomena themselves . The objective quality of these data will be analyzed in the course of the following discussion . A partial and pseudo-objective conception of culture , which is quite prevalent among American anthropologists and a number of sociologists , is the **27;373;TOOLONG conception . From this point of view , culture is seen in a general way to be a product of man 's joint activities ; but the basic implications of this fact are neglected , while major emphasis is placed upon culture as a man-created environment to which individuals and groups must actively or passively adjust.14 In this connection , great attention is paid to psychological factors , and in many cases this includes the positing of mysterious tendencies , instincts , or qualities in man.15 An **27;402;TOOLONG analysis of // culture may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a science of culture . This approach is implicit in much of the writings of Goldenweiser , Dixon , Herskovits , Tozzer , Wundt , Ellwood , Wissler , Ogburn , and Willey . " Although Boas has given us little theoretical writing on which to base a judgment , his comprehension appears to be quite similar to these others.17 From this standpoint , culture , " that part of the environment which man has himself created and to which he must adjust himself , " IS is viewed as an adding or welding together of cultural traits into various complexes , patterns and civilizations . " The simplest unit of culture is the culture trait . In turn , a culture trait is defined as the simplest unit of culture . ( This type of circular reasoning does not make for clarity in analysis or research . ) Culture traits are of two general classes : material traits , such as steel rails , penknives , buildings and bridges ; and non-material traits , such as folkways , attitudes , beliefs , and ceremonials . Culture traits tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a culture complex . In turn complexes tend to integrate into a still more complicated unit , the culture pattern . The sum of the culture patterns equals a civilization ; and according to some writers , as Wissler , a civilization can be completely understood only when all of its culture traits have been enumerated . Others , ? Goldenweiser , for example , ? object to this emphasis on com plete enumeration . The sum total of a society 's culture traits con stitute its cultural base , while the geographical distribution of its cultural traits , complexes and patterns constitute a cultural area . Much of this sounds like an exercise in arithmetic . The mechani cal and structural nature of this analysis of cultural phenomena , which has been severely criticized by Malinowski and others , 20 is well illustrated by the following quotations from a well-known text on cultural sociology : " Civilization may somewhat aptly be compared to a beautiful rug . . . . Each trait is a thread ; these threads combine into complexes which are minor designs in the fabric , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major impression that one gains with the first hasty glance at a rug . " 21 Again , world civilization is likened to " grand-mother 's patch-work quilt , put together from a vast number of culture sections or areas . " 22 Comment seems unnecessary . One wonders that the analogy of nursery blocks was overlooked . The structural character of this approach is also exemplified by " The Universal Culture Pattern " which Wissler proposes as the sche matic basis upon which research on civilizations be carried on.23 It is difficult to discover any functional basis for the method which Wissler proposes . He seems to shift his basis of topical grouping from that of material traits to that of social activities and back again . Wissler states that the universal pattern is largely due to man 's innate characteristics , while the content of the pattern is due to his acquired modes of behavior.24 Perhaps the clearest indictment of this series of culture units // is to be found in the writings of those utilizing them . The social fact listed by one writer as a trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently , what one terms a complex , to another will appear to be a pattern . Even the same author may be guilty of such contradictory usage . " It remains to be seen if this confusion can be cleared up and these units standardized , or whether the confusion is inherent in the general approach itself . Certainly the concepts of culture trait and cultural base should be discarded , " as these are purely mechanical and non-realistic con ceptions and therefore of no practical usefulness either in research or illuminating description . While there exist such social in tegrations as those which the concepts complex , ( unique ) pattern and universal pattern attempt to describe , these concepts , to be really useful , must be more specifically and less mechanically defined . Their true sociological and functional character must be given adequate attention . Other more useful units of investigation have been devel oped , as those of the economic , control and other cultural pro cesses , the folkway and the nos ; and , from a somewhat different standpoint , the various forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both individual and group . While much further work needs to be done on the refining and stand ardizing of these units , their essential validity has already been demonstrated by the research findings resulting from their utili zation.27 // Let us continue our analysis of this pseudo-objective interpretation of cultural data . This rather crude attempt to define and analyze culture objectively has been coupled with various subjective tendencies . For example , the supposed cultural environment has been set off into a material and a non-material environment , and those objects composing the material environment are considered objective or tangible , while those composing the non-material , such as customs , mores , attitudes and values , are subjective and intangible.28 Furthermore , various students , as Goldenweiser , Ellwood , Ogburn , Tozzer , Boas and Dixon , refer to factors in this " subjective " grouping , such as individual psychology and reactions and group conduct , for partial explanations of cultural phenomena . According to this classification , only in so far as explanations are presented in terms of the supposedly material environment are we dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really objective phenomena renders the treatment quite unsatisfactory . Fortunately , no such predicament as this is inherent in cultural phenomena . Let us analyze this general concept of the environment and its two subdivisions . It seems legitimate to ask : If customs , attitudes , institutions , and material objects are all part of our cultural environment , then what is left to be environed ? Certainly not the group . Nor yet the individual , aside from his physical existence . Is social science to be reduced to a study of ( z ) shifting material and non-material environments and ( 2 ) the relating of physiological beings and groupings to these environments ? If the implications of an environmental approach were followed through to its logical conclusions , its inherent fallacies would become so apparent that it would stand self-condemned . To anyone // who has made more than a superficial examination of the facts , it is apparent that neither in actual life nor in functional analysis is it possible to set off individuals or groups , except as biological organisms , from customs , habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as tools and buildings . In the most real sense , these are but different aspects of one unitary social process . Let us examine the so-called material environment or , to use a preferable term , material objects of culture . Such objects are neither more objective nor more tangible than attitudes or customs , nor have such material objects any meaning apart from these other aspects . A material object can only be defined and understood in terms of the social behavior of human groupings which have utilized it . The earliest cultures , for example , have been studied on the basis of the findings of material elements of these cultures , and it has proved possible to group these and all cultures on the basis of the tools and technology used in each case . Now what social significance or possible meaning would a neolithic stone implement have , or a paleolithic cave drawing , or prehistoric pottery , or a modern factory or railroad , except as they serve as symbols or indices to the social behavior of the people using them ? So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Only as these objects are treated as parts in a related social whole is it possible to understand them . While the above writers would agree , no doubt , with this statement , their theory and analyses do not sufficiently take this principle into account . There is too much of the mechanical and structural in their conception of the social unity of a culture . The quandaries and contradictions now current in much of cultural analysis will disappear and a science of culture be built up only when the analysis of culture is approached from the standpoint that culture itself is a social process growing out of and consisting of collective human behavior , and that the units and social objects of interaction created in this process , such as folkways , attitudes , bridges , railroads , social personalities and institutions , are all equally objective and can be explained only in // terms of this collective behavior . Those writers who interpret culture in terms of social process have made a substantial begin ning in this direction . This first tendency to interpret culture in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental and structural with a group behavioristic approach . The resultant is a partial comprehension of the nature of culture . Another ex pression of this pseudo-objective tendency is to be found in the writings of Sumner , Keller , Small , Thomas and various other sociologists , and also in those of Malinowski and the func tionalists.29 This tendency is more objective than the other previ ously discussed , in that far more attention is given to collective activities and interrelationships in the explanation of culture . However , in another sense it is more subjective , in so far as cul ture is interpreted as an expression of man 's attempts to satisfy his ( supposed ) instinctive or basic desires . Let us take the func tionalists ' theory as an example of this trend . As the name which they have adopted implies , the functionalists view culture as a process , and insist ( in Malinowski 's words ) " that in every type of civilization , every custom , material object , idea , and belief but fills some vital function , has some task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . . . . " 3 ? The func tionalists must always " keep in mind the biological basis of civili zation , the correlation of culture to human wants , hence to human instincts and emotional disposition . Psychology , therefore , is in-dispensable for an understanding of culture . . . . Culture above all supplies primitive man with the means of supplying his wants . " 31 Therefore the relations of culture to its physical en vironment and to man 's biological needs are important . It is in // this emphasis on the biological basis of culture that the func tionalists separate themselves from the social process approach . To continue the quotation : " However , the functionalists hold that man , in the very act of culture , transcends his biological outfit . Biology therefore is not enough to explain culture . . . . Neither is psychology sufficient , for man 's most important business is done in common . " 32 Malinowski mentions as other consistent functionalists Richard Thurnwald , Radcliffe-Brown and Hoernle.33 E. B. Tylor and Robertson Smith are also claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of anthropologists is said to have been carried on with functionalist technique . This is per haps true . Malinowski need not have stopped there , since most social scientists are interested in analyzing the functional inter-relationships of culture or other social phenomena . However , in so far as Malinowski and the functionalists in terpret these functional interrelationships of culture in biological or innate psychological terns , they are using the concept of func tion in a metaphysical and discredited sense . More often Malin owski uses function in its more scientific sense , in terms of the social phenomena under observation . For example , in the study of primitive religion he finds that religion serves the functions of creating social cohesion in the group , and of controlling members ' behavior . Except for this qualified criticism , the functionalist 's approach offers much that is commendable , although hardly origi nal . At the present time what the science of culture needs is not so much originality in theory as emphasis on the established prin ciples of sociological analysis . The technique of research , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific originality available , and here the functionalists have made a real con tribution. // 3 . THE OBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF CULTURE Another approach and technique which is steadily gaining ground is that which views culture as a living organic whole , a social process , to be understood in terms of interaction , through contact of group with group , civilization with civilization , group with social situation , group with geographic , economic and other sociological factors , of one phase of a civilization with other phases , etc . From this point of view , all social objects created and interacting in this process , such as tools , folkways and mores , social personality , attitudes , and science , are equally objective ; that is , subject to scientific study in terms of social behavior . For the old sharp division between " subjective " and " objective " has disappeared here , since objectivity refers to the availability of data for scientific observation , analysis , and verification , while subjectivity refers to the non-availability of the phenomena . Ac-cording to this approach , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for scientific study , when the behavioristic technique is applied ; and with the perfection of this technique it is believed that all social phenomena will be found to be scien tifically available . The emphasis of this approach is necessarily on the dynamics of the cultural process , with prime interest in the sequences of social happenings . Social organization and structure are not neglected , but are always studied in relation to the processes in volved . While there are elements of this approach in the writings of most sociologists as well as social anthropologists , both earlier and modern , for a consistent and comprehensive adherence to this conception one must turn to the writings of the Marxian school and to those of Charles and Mary Beard , Kroeber , Lowie , Cooley , ParkBurgessand Wallis.34 Although their conclusions differ // considerably , the fundamental approach to culture is similar . The handling of this conception in the writings of some of these is open to criticism , yet in general the development is clear and consistent . Sumner , Small , Durkheim , Chapin , Giddings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture as a collective social process.36 Of those making primarily an environmental and psychological analysis of the nature of culture , Ogburn and Thomas seem to have been most influenced by the social process approach.37 In our discussion of the dynamics of culture and trends in research , this approach will be given further attention . II . DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF CULTURE PHENOMENA Regardless of the point of view from which the study of culture is approached , there is a growing tendency among culturalists to emphasize the relative independence of cultural phenomena . " Culture , " it is stated , " is a thing sui generis which can be only explained in terms of itself , " 38 ? that is , in terms of social phenomena . The point of view is that we have here a realm of phenomena which is as relatively distinct and independent as that with which physics , biology , or any other natural science deals . Consequently , in any endeavor to analyze the interactions // and interrelationships of cultural phenomena , that is , to discover natural laws governing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally accepted scientific procedure , must first study the phenomena themselves , rather than seek for explana tion within another universe of phenomena . This amounts to an open break with all biological , whether instinctivist , racial , or individual psychological , determinists of human social phenomena . While the earlier anthropologists and many sociologists started with a distinct bias toward the biologi cal determinism of culture , the logic of the facts revealed by social and anthropological research has led a great majority of the modern group to an extended qualification of the earlier theory in this respect , and in recent years a significant number have made an outright repudiation of the significance of biological factors in the evolution of civilization . There are , of course , critics of this position among the stu dents of culture , notably Malinowski , Dixon , Keller , Boas , Gold enweiser , Sapir and Thomas , who represent the tendency in recent years to assign a more modified , though still fundamental , role to biological factors.39 Among the iconoclasts themselves , some would push the re-volt further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubting Thomases of all biological theories of social phenomena . This attitude of straddling the issue is especially popular with certain sociologists . They do not deny that man has instincts , nor that man 's instincts play a role in the determination of culture ; but they prefer the flank attack , demon strating how much of what was formerly interpreted as instinc tive or innate behavior of human individuals and groups may be more adequately explained in terms of cultural differentiation and social conditioning . Ogburn and Chapin make this approach , while Kroeber , Lowie , Wallis , Sutherland , and the historical // materialists , would go to the logical length of their position , and keep strictly within the field of social interaction , in analyzing and interpreting cultural phenomena.4o I. SOME ERRORS IN STATEMENT OF POSITION A few occasionally even go beyond the logical limit , in their enthusiasm overstating their point , and so leaving themselves open to obvious criticism by psychologists and others . For example , Wallis , in his " Independence of Social Psychology , " 41 leaves the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals composing a group in order to understand the group . This , of course , is an untenable position , and one which Wallis himself does not actually hold . The true significance of fhe individual , however , in any group , lies in the fact that he a locus of social stimuli and responses , customs , attitudes , and other habits acquired in former groupings . In other words , it is not the individual as such that is important , but the group-conditioned modes of social response and stimuli which have accumulated in , and form his social personality . There is another type of going beyond the limit in declaring the independence of social phenomena . Kroeber , in his " Super-organic , " 42 the most widely known summary in support of this general position on the independence of social phenomena , has damaged an otherwise good argument by insisting on sharp breaks between man and other animals , and between organic and " super-organic " ( i.e. , social ) evolution . He unfortunately chooses as the basis of his argument a false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really essential to his major proposi tion . Also his use of the metaphysical and anthropomorphic term , " super-organic , " to designate cultural phenomena is inde fensible. // Not only is there no sharp break between man and other ani mals biologically , but socially we find the beginnings of social heritage and social control , among other animals . While these are but small beginnings , limited by the other animals ' seeming inability to develop symbols and therefore reflective thinking , re-search on the social side of animal groupings more and more in dicates that the differences even socially between man and the other animals are of degree rather than of kind . Ellwood , Markey , Bernard , Giddings and various others have emphasized the continuity of social development existing among all animal life including man , and the research on the development of lan guage habits in man gives further evidence in support of this position.43 There are other evidences that the differences between man and the other animals are of degree rather than of kind . We are discovering that animals , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on instinctive modes of response , and that socially acquired modes of response play a more impor tant role . Also , as among human groupings , much of animal behavior formerly considered instinctive ? as , for example , fears of certain other species ? has been shown to be acquired through social conditioning.44 // 2 . THE QUANDARY OVER THE GEOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT Another weak point is the denial by some of these culturalists of any significant role to geographic factors . Certainly Semple , Huntington , Buckle , Ratzel and others have grossly exaggerated the effects of physical and geographic conditions upon social development.45 However , it is one thing to deny a determining rOle to the geographic environment . It is quite another to deny any rOle whatever to the geographic environment , except that of a limiting factor , as Boas , Lowie , Wallis , Goldenweiser , Willey and others would do.46 These are correct in pointing out that not only does the geographic environment fail to explain culture , but that this geographic environment must be interpreted always in terms of the culture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter point is demonstrated by the fact that history reveals peoples living in almost identical environments with di-verse cultures , and other peoples with cultural similarities in un-like environments.47 However , eco-geographic conditions exert dynamic as well as limiting effects on cultural development . Grant-ing a social heritage which makes possible their utilization , the location of coal , iron , oil , or other essential deposits in a region definitely gives an impetus to economic and other social devel-opments of that section . Wissler , for instance , calls attention to the relation existing between the centers of diffusion and distribution of the world 's coal resources . Also , geographic factors are influential in determining trade routes and trading centers , and these latter have long been recognized as important mediums of contact and diffusion // It is quite true , as various writers have pointed out , that geographic factors are never independent ones , nor all-determining nor invariable in their effects . Such factors must be studied in relationship to a group 's culture , of which they are , in fact , a part . Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be included as part of the socioeconomic processes and their dynamics . Recently a trend somewhat in this direction has been developing , with a newer emphasis on the role of the geographic as an interacting part of the total social situation . According to the proponents of this position , such as McKenzie and other ecologists , Wissler , and Charles Beard , the role is positive as well as negative in character . When the position on the relative independence of culture phenomena is dissociated from these errors , it stands out as theoretically sound . Further , as a principle of methodological procedure , it has justified itself again and again . For the acid test of any scientific theory lies in its applicability to concrete problems of research , and in its usefulness in revealing sequential relationships in the phenomena being studied . In other words , a scientific procedure must be judged by the accuracy of its predictions . This procedure , which for the want of a better term may be called sociological , has proved far more valuable in this respect than has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of analyzing culture , the trend is clearly in this direction . In presenting their brief against the instinctivists and racial determinists , the cultural independence group make out a much stronger case . It seems unnecessary to enter into any discussion of the instinct controversy here , as it is discussed at various points in other chapters in this book . 3 . RACE AND CULTURE A significant issue over which the culturalists as well as most of the other sociologists have locked horns , metaphorically speaking , with the biological determinists , is that of race as a factor in cultural evolution . A92 TRENDS IN AMERICAN SOCIOLOGY This controversial subject has occupied many pages of print , both in book and magazine form , and the interested reader is referred to the summaries of the culturalists ' position as presented by Kroeber , Lowie , Wallis , Herskovits , Goldenweiser , and Boas.4S For critical interpretation of the results of the mental testing of races , Bond and Wallis are recommended.4 ? For the position of the racial determinists , the reader is referred to the writings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixon . " The latter takes a more qualified stand , however , than the others . The controversy centers around the relative merits or demer its of the colored peoples , as builders of culture . This is not to be wondered at in a country where the subjection of Indians , Negroes , and other colored peoples to white economic and im perialistic interests has played , and is playing , such a role . This is not primarily a dispute between psychologists and sociologists . It is a controversy between science and the mores of exploitation , with many scientists seemingly quite unaware of the basis and extent of their ethnocentric bias . The culturalists , while not always presenting as adequate a case as they might , come off with the incomparably better part of the argument . They have been able to show that the racial determinists are quite ignorant of the complex scientific problems arising out of racial migrations and intermixture ; also that they // not only use the popular unscientific definitions of race , but make the inexcusable error of identifying race with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulation of a wealth of historical data on the subject , that race is but a chance carrier of culture . Various groupings of each race in the course of its history have varied in their position relative to other cul-tural groups , at one time ranking as " low , " or more simple , at an-other as " high , " or more complex , types of civilization . The results of the mental testing of racial groups within this country and of the psychological testing of groups in Australia have been subjected to such critical scrutiny and reinterpretation that only one with a closed mind could study the analyses and still hold that " the mental tests prove the Negro race inferior . " Finally , the culturalists have pointed out the ethnocentric character of the white group 's judgments and scale of values . Also , through their research they have brought to the attention of the western hemis-phere the accomplishments and contributions to world culture of the so-called backward peoples . However , considering the question as to whether race has a casual or a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world today , most writers in this country , DuBois and Nearing excepted , have given no or but scant attention to the most basic phase of the matter : the socio-economic foundation of these differences . " A combination of interacting social factors , mainly eco-geographic and technologi-cal in nature , such as the coming of the commercial and indus-trial revolutions and the invention of modern methods of warfare , first developed in parts of the world inhabited by peoples who happened to be white . Further , these developments , which can be shown to be due not to any innate superior abilities of these peoples but to a combination of social circumstances , laid the basis for the material and other cultural advances within these societies of which the Nordics are so proud . Furthermore , the // business groups dominant within these societies , in their desire for ever greater profits , naturally became interested in the opportunities for exploitation of the labor power , natural resources , and undeveloped markets in non-industrialized sections of the earth , and utilized their superior economic and military techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having less effective methods of warfare . These latter peoples happened to be colored . In final analysis , it is industrialism coupled with imperialism , and not biological equipment , which has handicapped the development of the colored races . But with the coming of industrial revolution and its attendant social changes in these former nonindustrialized parts of the world , a series of remarkably rapid developments are taking place . The new classes of native capitalists and wage-earners have emerged , and with them nationalistic agitation and strongly anti-imperialist labor movements . It seems probable that the so-called " backward peoples " of India , China and Africa , on the basis of this new technique and social organization , will succeed in freeing themselves from foreign domination and build cultures not only equal but possibly superior to those on which the western white man prides himself , because these new cultures will probably not be based on exploitation of one race or class by another . In such an event , the fallacies inherent in any theory of racial determinism of culture will be completely demonstrated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural phenomena can then concentrate their energies on the more real problems in their fields . 4 . SUMMARY : GENERAL TREND TOWARD MORE STRICTLY SOCIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF CULTURE This varied attack on the older theories of culture 's dependence on biological , individual , or geographic factors represents , for American students of culture , a break with individualism , and a beginning orientation toward collective activity and the social situation as the actual units of culture . This trend is // by no means fully or clearly developed as yet , either in individual scientists or in the group as a whole . Some vacillate , some at-tempt to integrate the old with the new with a hodgepodge as a resultant , and a few achieve a relatively consistent , radical de parture . Yet the trend is there . The implications of this newer orientation for research , as ; well as theory , are significant , for it furnishes the basis for a different point of departure for scientific investigation than has usually been followed . III . TRENDS IN THE STUDY OF CULTURAL CHANGE Much research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural , since the determination of the various sequences in cultural change constitute the central problem of the science . In seeking to discover these sequences , students of culture have developed many variations in point of view . There are the skeptics who question the existence of any repetitive sequences in cultural phenomena , as well as those who hold to a general social evolutionary position . Some hold , with Boas , 53 that only the most generalized type of sequence can be formulated ; while others think that it is possible to formulate laws of change for only very narrow specific types of sequences . Quite a number conceive of these sequences within a society taking a cyclical form , and seek to generalize on this basis.54 Throughout these variations , two outstanding and rather contradictory tendencies are observable . // I. DIFFUSION AND INVENTION , THE TWIN OPEN-SESAMES By far the most popular procedure in America at the present time is that which virtually discards all hypotheses of general laws of social evolution , and places its emphasis rather on the uniqueness of each cultural group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and geographical setting in order to discover the sequences in its development . This genetic approach to a society 's culture is , of course , sound , but the virtual denial of social evolution seems to the writer far less so . According to this approach , known as the historical school of American anthropology , all dynamics of social change can be summarized under the magic terms of Diffusion and Invention.55 It is held that every change in the culture of a society is initiated either through an invention within the group or , as more frequently happens , through borrowing and the consequent diffusion of culture traits or complexes from one group to another . Since diffusion is the more common initiator of change , major attention has been given by most of this school to the discovery of the supposed laws of diffusion . However , there are few , if any , strict diffusionists in America , in theory . Ogburn has given more attention than most to the problems of invention . " Certainly the generalization that new aspects of a civilization must be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except on the score of its inadequacy . For examination of the research findings and more detailed analyses of diffusion and invention processes reveal that these analyses on the whole // are valuable as far as they go , but that many fundamental aspects of the problems involved are not only unanswered but even un touched . This is in part due to the fact that most of the work has been done from the **27;431;TOOLONG point of view , and in part to the fact that the units of investigation , such as trait , complex and pattern , are theoretically unsound . There is also a dangerous tendency to treat these essentially functional processes in a purely mechanical way , and to think that , with the mapping of the geographic distribution of culture traits , all scien tific questions involved have been answered . This has gone so far that some workers in this field have found it necessary to caution against such an attitude . In consequence , the treatment of cultural dynamics is rather fragmentary or piecemeal , and superficial in character . The organic unitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often obscured . The generalizations set forth regarding social change are briefly as follows : Social change is initiated through an invention within the group , only when the following prerequisites are present ? the necessary level of cultural development , a certain need for or timeliness of the invention and , incidentally , an inven tor or inventors . Factors inhibiting the adoption or spread of the invention are psychological in nature , as the inertia of habit , psychological difficulties of adjustment to the new , and fear of social displeasure , and sociological , such as weight of tradition , social pressure , and vested interests . Factors facilitating the adoption of an invention are the need for and obvious value of the new element to the group ( or , more accurately , to those in con trol in that group or society ) . According to Ogburn and others , changes come first and more easily in the " material environment , " and " social lags " accumulate in the " non-material environment , " until the necessity of adjustment brings about the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment , then , is held to be an important factor in the dynamics of culture . As has been pointed out earlier in this discussion , it is impossible to set social life off into " material " and " non-material " environments and use these as efficient tools of analysis . In fact , Ogburn and others attempting this feat in concrete analysis do not accomplish it . Their efforts to do so , however , often lead them up blind alleys and into strange contradictions . Their predicament grows out of the indiscriminate grouping of all material social objects into a body , called an environment , and the making of this the main dynamics of social change . For the actual dynamics lie not in material objects as such , and a supposed necessity for adjustment to them , but in the technology and social organization of the economic process , including its inner contradictions , etc. , and the interrelations of this process with the political and other phases of a society 's life . Consequently , in specific analysis , these writers usually resolve " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of a group 's economic life and changes therein , with a consequent series of changes set in motion first in economic activities and relations and then in other phases . However , the role of social groupings and classes in this series of events is usually underestimated . The full value of what is essentially sound in this procedure is lost , due to the confused setting in which the environmentalists place it . Indeed , the statement and to a less extent the handling of this method of analysis of cultural dynamics often comes close to an unintentional caricature of the historical materialistic technique . As to social change which is initiated within a society through diffusion of borrowed elements , social contact between groups is naturally the first prerequisite , and such factors as the development of trade relations , trade centers , and routes , means of communication , wars , conquests , etc. , are found to be some common promoters of social contact , and hence , diffusion . Trade as a diffuser of culture has been especially emphasized , and rightly so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic // complex , stimulating diffusion of both the organized , or planned , and the unorganized , or non-deliberate , types . For example , the activities carried on by financial and industrial , as well as com mercial , interests in their search for profits have today many ram ifications , in promoting and inhibiting cultural diffusion , as well as invention ; and the development of trade relations is but one of them . Dixon 58 mentions imperialism as one source of diffu sion , and he is undoubtedly right ; but he does not follow through an analysis of the content , method , or results of this type of engendered diffusion . Major attention has been given to the " psychological " factors affecting the adoption and diffusion of a new culture trait or com plex , but there is much deductive reasoning and little agreement as to what the factors are.59 Factors furthering or hindering dif fusion are largely the same as those mentioned as facilitating or inhibiting invention . Also it is held that elements of the mate rial environment diffuse more easily than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earlier analysis is continued here . As an instance of this , great emphasis has been placed on the necessity of a new trait or complex fitting into the existing culture patterns of a group ; otherwise it will not be adopted . The inadequate nature of this generalization is revealed when specific examples of diffusion or non-diffusion are studied . For example , the social innovations of the industrial revolution did not " fit into the existing culture patterns " of the Chinese , Indian and Japanese people , yet industrial revolution is well under way in these countries . There are , of course , vital interrelationships existing within a group 's social activities , and the fact that a new folkway or social object can be easily inte grated into the already existent collective life of a people naturally facilitates the adoption of the new activity . But this fact alone would not assure , nor its absence preclude , the adoption of the
