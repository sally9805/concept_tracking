txt Confidence in J.H. Thomas . Mr. S. H. Thomas is an associate member of the American Club in London . When Mr. Stanley Baldwin was made Premier , Thomas came into the club and mixed where men meet in a London club . I asked him what he thought of Baldwin . His reply was that from the labor point of view " Baldwin was the most honest Premier England ever had ' and they trusted him . " We I Americans in London always liked Thomas for his sterling worth , and he has those qualities that appeal to Americans most . My view is that Baldwin and Thomas are like the generals in old days who used to shake hands before they fought and , if I am any judge , will take care that there will be as few " wounded " as possible in a struggle which was inevitable and can have only one ending  --  England carries on .
