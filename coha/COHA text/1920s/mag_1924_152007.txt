An obliging young woman is Miss Joyce Wethered . She spent last week going around and around the Cooden Beach golf links in Sussex , England , demonstrating to her countrywomen that she , aged 22 , is by far the ablest golfemale whom great Britain-and perhaps the world- possesses . It was the third time in as many years that Miss Wethered had made this ladies ' championship demonstration . In her six 18-hole matches this year , she permitted none of her opponents save Miss Cecil Leitch , semifinalist , to survive beyond the 14th green . Miss Leitch reached the 15th . In the 36-hole final , Miss D. R. Fowler walked back to the clubhouse from the 29th.
