txt Calls Nurses Underpaid . In connection with the remarks of " Layman " in your issue of this morning , I am Quite sure that " Layman " has his facts all wrong with respect to the charges of graduate nurses . The regular tees of a nurse are $0 Per day for twelve-hour duty tend ; 7 for twenty-fourYour duty . This , I am Inclined to think , is the longest day 's work which any class puts In . Taking also into consideration the fact that nurses have to put in three years training , during which time they work for little or nothing and put in the hours as mentioned , my opinion is that they are one of the very few underpaid professionals in the field today . The fact ought to be considered , too , in criticizing the rates that they do not work continuously , but sometimes go several days without a case . I very much doubt that the average earnings of any nurse will amount to more than $30 a week . ? ? ? FAIR PLAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
