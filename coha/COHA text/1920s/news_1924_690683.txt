txt A Defense of Mother Goose . To the Editor of The New York Times : In answer to the letter of Gomtesse de Druche , I want to say that the very rhymes she quotes as being bad for children 's manners , courage , and so on , may be used to teach them a number of things . Tack Horner 's manners were probably Quite correct when the rhyme was written . Tell the children how standards have improved . Tommy Tucker got " white bread and butter " as a treat , as black bread without butter was his daily fare . There are all sorts of things of that kind to teach history and customs of the past in all of Mother Goose . As for poor English , my children have been shown that it was used either because it was correct at that time , or simply to rhyme . And as to the " Inferiority complex " ! Most boys enjoy being told that they axe made of " snakes and ' snails " much better than they would care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spice , " and even little fellows - will see and enjoy the fun in such a contrast . H. W. SCOTT , New York . Sept , ' 29 , 1921.
