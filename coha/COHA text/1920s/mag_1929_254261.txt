President Hoover last week ordered out of commission the U.S.S. Mayflower to save $300,000 annual maintenance and to send nine officers and 148 men back to regular naval duty . Scotch built in 1896 , she was purchased by the U.S. from the estate of Ogden Goelet for $480,000 for Spanish War service . President Roosevelt first used her as an official yacht , as did all his successors . President Hoover is no yachtsman . <P> A fortnight ago Secretary of the Navy Adams ordered scrapped or sold his official yacht , the 31-year-old Sylph . Bought for $50,000 in 1898 , she is now too decrepit to repair . Secretary Adams has yachts of his own . <P> A third famed official yacht is the Apo , assigned to the Governor-General of the Philippines . She , too , was without an official user last week , owing to the departure of Statesman Stimson for the U.S. ( see col. 2 ) . As the Amelia she was built in Scotland for King Carlos of Portugal when his son Manuel was a dashingly amorous prince . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luscious actress Gaby Deslys ( real name : Madeline Caire , 1884-1920 ) . Manuel first espied Gaby in a disrobing act in a London music hall . Her baby-blue eyes went straight to his heart . He gowned her and be jeweled her from the Portuguese treasury , took her cruising on the Amelia , of which a notable appointment was a royal bed eight feet wide . Later Gaby danced in the Folies Bergeres , toured the U.S. with many a huge and fluttery fan , smiled at wisecracks about Manuel and died in Paris of a throat infection following influenza . The Amelia was sold to U.S. Oilman Henry Clay Pierce who renamed her the Yacona . In turn he disposed of her to the U.S. for use in the Philippines where she was given her third name , Apo , after the Islands ' highest mountain .
