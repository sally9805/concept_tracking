txt James Cox Brady , son of the late Anthony N. Brady , traction and public utility financier . testifying in the Surrogate 's Court today , in defense of his accounting of his father 's estate , was compelled to reveal some of the secret methods used by " insiders " in Wall Street to speculate in the securities of their own corporations . Questioned practically all day long by ' skier Kresel , attorney for his three sisters and a niece who are objecting to the accounting of Mr. Brady and his brother , Nicholas F. Brady , for the years 1920 and 1021 , Mr. Brady told all about his transactions in B. R. T. stock in Wall Street while he was a Director of the company and a member of its Executive Committee . He admitted that he had bought and sold B. R. T. stocks in Wall Street during a ' period of five years and justified the practice by saying he believed he had a perfect right to do it . He objected to the use of the word " gambling ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term for " trading ? in stocks . " The attorney , for the objecting beneficiaries elicited from Mr. Brady that he had accounts with many ' Wall Street brokers and that some of them were " dummy accounts , " labeled by numbers instead of names , for the pur-. chase and sale of his own stocicholdings .. The witness also admitted that he and his brother had sold their thousands of shares of B. R. T. in 1917. 1918 and 1919 , prior to its headlong crash that took it irorn 87 , its market value when Anthony N. Brady 's heirs acquired it in 1917 , to less than $8 after the company went into the hands of a receiver . . Mr. Brady also acknowledged that his position in the company made it possible for him to know everything about its financial status at that time , but he denied that either he or his brother had foreseen the catastrophe . He said he had always believed that it was a good property and would come back to the position in which his father had placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his brother to have retained their faith in it for so long . Mr. Kresler examined the witness par- ticularizi on his reasons for not selling the B. R. T. stock held in trust , under his father 's will , for the four heirs who are now objecting to the accounting . These heirs are three sisters of James C. and Nicholas F. Brady , and a niece . The sisters are Mrs. Francis P. Garvan , wife of the head of the Chemical r ounuation and former Alien Property Custodian ; Mrs. Carl Tucker of New York and Mrs. James C. Farrell of Albany . The niece is Mariana Gavat of Santa Barbara , Cal .. whose father was a brother of John Palmer Gavat . Declare Trust Values Increased . The witness admitted that he and his brother , who arc executors and trustees of the estate , liquidated their own holdings early in the game at an average-of about $40 a share , and were only able to realize an average of about $11 a share for the stock held in trust for the four women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own stock was $13.81 a share , while . he let some of the trust stock go for as little as $5.88 . However , he insisted that he and his brother had lost more than the four women . He said his brother 's loss was $1,500,000 ; his own , $1,300,000 , and each of the four trusts lost about $1,000,000 . By the last day of December , 1919 , Mr. Brady admitted ? he had sold out all his B. R. T. holdings except onesixth of a share , and his brother nad sold everything but 420 shares . The witness said that both ? for himself and foe ' the trusts he had sold B. R. T. stock heavily at the end of 1918 in order to establish losses for the purpose of deductions from income tax returns . By so ( /ing- , he said , he had saved the trust funds In his father 's estate 70 per cent . of the losses they sustained because of the ' drop in B. R. T. stock , and had also offset profits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Brady admitted that at times he used money belonging to the estate to make purchases of stock for his individ'eal accounting , but intimated that this was only a matter of bookkeeping . He said this was done only when he was making- purchases for himself at the same time as he bought for the trusts . &flitting; that he and his brother once organized a pool to take some Maxwell stock off the hands of the estate . Mr. Brady denied that they had ever taken any part in pools to pick up the B. R. T. stock or other securities which the estate was forced to liquidate . He also denied that he had made a ten-point profit in 1990 by selling : i , e00 shares of Southern Pacific stock to the estate at 107 which he had bought at less than 96 . Following the examination of Mr. I Brady , former Governor Nathan L. ! NIiller. who appeared as chief counsel i for the Brady brothers and for the Ceti ; tral Union Trust Company of New York , i which is a trustee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the four trust funds has increased $3,000,000 since they were established , in 1915 , and that they have paid 7 per cent . interest annually , despite the losses in B. R. T. Former Justice George L. Ingraham 1 of the Appellate Division is associated 1 with Mr. Miller for the trustees , ? and former Attorney General George W. Wickersham and Lewis E. Carr are associated with Mr. Kresel for the complaining beneficiaries . At the end of today 's hearing Surrogate George Lawyer adjourned the case until April 9 and directed that the case should be concluded at continuous daily hearings commencing on that date . . Did n't Expect B. H. T. Collapse . Mr. Brady was the only witness of the day . Subjected to the searching examination of Mr. Kresel , he had an ordeal on the stand lasting continuously from 10:30 A. M. to 5 P. M. , except for a recess for luncheon . Mr , Brady said that after . his father 's death the estate was divided into six equal parts . He and his brother Nicholas-each received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sisters and the niece who are now objecting to the brothers ' accounting as executors and trustees . Besides other securities , each of the six trusts contained large blocks of B. R .. T. stock . When the trusts were established he said the stock was selling in the market for 87 . Two years later , ho went on , It fell to 40 and in 1918 to 35 Dividends were 6 per cent . annually until 1918 , when they were passed with a final quarterly payment of 12 , - ? per cent . In reply to questions , Mr. Brady said he was a Director and member of the Executive Committee of the B. R. T. and therefore familiar with its financial situation . Reading from annual reports and other documents . Mr. Kresel then sought to show and to make Mr. Brady admit , that he bad foreseen the cols lapse and receivership of the B. R. T. The attorney recited figures showing that the operating charges increased from $10,960,381 in 1015 to $15,603,908 in 1910 : to $16,741,417 in 1917 and to $18,111,805 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also showed that the company 's tax payments had increased almost 30 per cent . in the same period ; from$1.700,000 in 1915 to 4:1,837,000 In 1910 : $2,351,000 in 1917 and $2,443,000 in 1918 . The fixed charges , Mr  --  Kresel Pointed out , were $6.393.000 in 1915 , $7,081,000 in 1916. $7,995,000 in 1917 and $8,090,000 in 1918 . During the same period , the attorney showed , operating charges per passenger increased so much that the earnings - dropped from eight-tenths of a cent per passenger to one-half of a cent . The surplus out of which dividends could be paid , Mr. Kresel also pointed out , decreased $1,400,000 from 1915 to 1918 , falling from $5,512,000 to $4,112,000 . Mr. Brady admitted all this , but insisted that he had not realized the seriousness of the situation . " We thought we were making a fairly good showing , " he testified . ? We were falling off , but did not think we were heading for a receivership . " Followed Father 's Wishes . " ' Under the terms of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in earnings , we thought we were doing right in holding on to the stock , " Mr. Brady testified . " We handled it in the way we were convinced my father wanted it handled . We felt he wanted us to.hold on to the , properties he had built up . We stuck to them . because we believed in them . Had it not been for the very short money market due to war condtions. the B. R. T. would now be a very valuable property . We felt there was a chance of refunding the money advanced by the War Finance Board and thus restoring dividends . " Mr. Kresel asked the witness if he knew how- much his brother Nicholas still had on the same date . The reply was that Nicholas had only 426 shares . " Now , when you sold those 6.200 shares of your own stock in 1917 , " Mr. Kresel asked , " did you sell them because you thought they were a good invest ment ? " " My real reason for trading in the stock was that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I thought it was high . " " The fact is that you were gambling in B. R. T. stock ; is n't that right ? " the attorney demanded . " When I needed money , I sold when I thought it was high . " " T sold it when I needed money . " " When you sold - stock because you thought it was high , why did n't you sell it for the trust ? " " I did n't think the trust was the proper place for a speculation . " Mr. Kresel then read from documents to show that Mr. Brady- averaged $40.42 a share for the sale of his B. R. T. stock , ' while the trust averaged $11.50 . " Do you deny that ? " the lawyer asked : - " I do n't deny it , because I never had it figured . " " Do you mean to tell me that you have n't had your accountants figure out how you came out ? " " My accountants have figured out that my loss in B. R. T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was $1,590. - 000. while each of the trusts only lost e1,0e9,000 . " Mr. Kressel insisted that the averages showers the trusts fared worse than the . brothers . And Mr. Brady admitted that the best price he got in liquidating the trust stock was $27 , while he got from 838 to $42 for his- own stock , " What was the lowest price you ever realized from your own stock ? " Mr. Kressel ' asked . " $13.81 . " " And the lowest the trust fund got ? " " $5.88 . " Made Profit on Tobacco Stock . Mr. Brady was then asked about the relation of his sale of a large block of American Tobacco Company Common stock for the trust in 1919 at a big profit to the sale of B. R. T. stock at a loss . " Was the only reason you sold the B. H. T. trust stock at a tremendous loss , " Mr. Kressel asked , " because it would benefit the trust by offsetting the tremendous profit on the tobacco stock ? " " Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been protests from Mr. Garvan against holding the stock . and that influenced us. t was not until December that we knew we could offset our losses by selling the trust stock and establishing losses against gains in principal . When Collector Edwards made this announcement we had to hurry to get under the wire . That was the reason we sold the stock so low as we did , and at that particular time it offset our gains almost to a penny . " " Do you remember how much American Tobacco stock you threw on the market on Oct. 10 and 11 , 1910 ? . ' Mr. Kressell asked . Mr. Miller objected to the characterization " threw onto the market . " and the examiner withdrew it , asking how many shares had been sold . Mr. Brady testified that 22,628 shares had been sold for the four trusts on the two days . He said the sales were made through a " Tobacco account " with Edey &; Co. in the regular way on the New York Stock Exchange . Denies Sales to a l'o-a . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney demanded , " that the Tobacco stock was not sold on the New York Stock Exchange in the regular way , but was sold to a pool ? " " Is n't it a fact that you and your brother Nicholas were members of that pool ? " " No . Absolutely not . " Mr. Brady said the only pool he remembered that he and his brother had been in was " a Maxwell pool . " He said they had taken some trust stock in this case and sold it to the pool . We formed a pool ' and sold the stock to the pool so as to get something for the stock , " he explained . " Were you or your brother ever in a pool formed to . acquire the ' R. J. Reynolds stock ' owned by the trust ? " Mr. Brady replied in the negative , saying he had declined an invitation to join : this , pool ; ? which was firi : 1922 , following the period how At issue . " Did n't you sell the trust stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , some of it  --  at 40 ? Mr. Brady admitted this - was so , and Mr. Kresel int:mired if a stock dividend of ** per cent , had not been declared shortly after the sale , and if the shares were not selling now at 58 . " Did n't you and your brother know when you sold the stock around 40 that a stock dividend was to be declared ? " " No , " Mr. Brady replied . " Did n't you and your brother get a . share of the profits ? " Absolutely not . " Returning to the balancing of profit on the American Tobacco sales with the loss on B. R. T. sales , Mr. Kresel asked the witness if it was not true that he had not sold any Tobacco before October , 1919 . Told that this was so , Mr. Kresel then pointed out that Mr. Brady had started selling B. R. T. for the trust in May of the same year and by the time the big Tobacco profits were made the trust had already lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Asked why he had not sold all the trust stock in May , 1919 , when it brought around 25 , Mr. Brady replied that the stock had been deposited with a committee , and certificates of deposit had been accepted in exchange . Such a widespread change in price had arisen between the stock and the certificates of deposit , amounting at the peak to 7 per cent. , he said , that it would have entailed great sacrifice to sell all the stock at the time . " When , on Dec. 31. 1918 , when a receiver was appointed for the B. R. T .. did n't you realize It was your duty as a trustee to get the trust out of the investment as speedily as possible ? " Mr. Brady said he did not realize it , and , as a matter of fact , had bought some stock about that time at about 40 . Explains Deal in Southern Pacific . Mr. Kresel then asked about the purchase of 700 shares of Southern Pacific stock by the Carvan Trust and similar lots , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 18 , 1920 . The books of the estate showed there had been a cash payment to Mr. Brady on that date of $80,281.67 , less 1 per cent . dividend due Jan. 2 , 1920 , of $1,125 , making the net payment $79,156.87 . The books also showed that stock was bought at $107.0424 per share . " Now , Mr. Brady , " said the lawyer . " Southern Pacific stock was selling in the open market on Feb. 18 , 1920 , at from 0538 to 96% per share , and you appear to have sold it to the trust at 107 ? " Mr. Brady said that this was not the case . He explained that in October , 1919 , he and ' his brother had planned to buy 2,000 shares apiece for themselves and each trust . They did buy 2,000 shares on Oct. 23 at 109.31 . " We were going to buy more , " he went on , " but we began- to doubt the information we had received about the stock . We were afraid the Pacific Oil Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do anything more until Nov. 13 , when we bought 3,000 shares Southern Pacific at 105.65 , making 5,000 shares at an average of 107 . The market went down then , and we did n't buy any more . When we allotted the stock , my brother and I took our full allotment , but only allotted 750 shares each to the trusts . In November of 1920 it became clear that the Pacific Oil dividend would be distributed , and we bought enough for the trust - to make 2,000 shares apiece . We bought at 113 in November , 1920. making the average for the trust of 111 a share . On Feb. 28 the rights to Pacific Oil stock were given out and we subscribed at $15 a share . - we subsequently sold the rights for $45 ; making a profit that reduced the cost of the Southern Pacific , so that it is now profitable : " Mr. Brady denied- that- he had made 10 points a share on the 3,000 shares sold to the trust in February 1920 . He said he had not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estate Money . Mr. Kressel examined Mr. Brady about his purchase on Oct. 2 , 1919 , of 9,831 shares of Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland . Ltd. , for $41,142 . The witness admitted that he had expected to pay for this i purchase out of the estate money " It was n't all estate money , " the witness added . " Sometimes the estate , owed my brother and me money , and it I was tarried in the estate 's account . " " Did the estate owe you that $41 , - 142 ? " ? " Ta do n't say . that . I do n't know what the condition was on that date . " On April 15 , 1920 . Mr. Brady bought 7,291 shares of - the same Tobacco stock for $8,633 . Mr. Kresel demanued : " Does that mean the estate paid out of its funds for ' your account that sum to buy you those shares ? " " Not necessarily . - The estate may have owed me money . I refer you - to my accountants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kresel told the Court estate $35,945 , and at the time of the first purchase James C. Brady owed the estate $23,945 , and ' at the time of the second owed it $89,736 . He went on : " Did n't you and your brothers as executors pay for the shares for your brother and yourself as individuals ? " Yes . " On June 1 . 1920 , 462 shares of Liggett , Myers Tobacco Company were bought by the witness for $46.200 out of estate funds . Dar . Kresel asked whether these purchases were for the estate , and Mr. Brady said : " They were for my account , but had to be subscribed to by the estate , because the certificates were in its name . The estate bought all this stock and paid out the money in all these instances . " Were the purchases for the estate ? " " Oh , no . I did n't Mean that . " Governor Miller sprang up to insist ' that the examination was " in bad faith and can have . no legitimate purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of the Continental Insurance Company , of which he was a Director , with $170,000 of estate money , his brother and others objected that it was a bad investment . He said he got rid of the purchase a few weeks later . This was the purchase on which he received $5,000 in dividends , and regardislewhich he could not recall having paid any interest to the estate for the use of its money . Declaring at first that the purchase was for the estate , he admitted finally that he had no record to show this to be the fact .
