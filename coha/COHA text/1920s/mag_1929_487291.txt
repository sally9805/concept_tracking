S ALVATORE ACCORSI . Remember the name . It belongs to an obscure Italian workman now on trial for his life in Pittsburgh for the murder , in 1927 , of John J. Downey , Pennsylvania State trooper . On August 22 , 1927 , a number of workers and their families were holding a meeting in the apple orchard of a private farm near Cheswick , Pennsylvania , to protest against the execution in Boston of two other obscure Italian workmen named Sacco and Vanzetti , doomed to die that very night at twelve . Almost as soon as these fatal names were mentioned , mounted State police burst into the farm and with tear gas , clubs , and revolvers broke up what had been a quiet and altogether legal meeting . In the confusion and violence that followed ? during which 300 men , women , and children were injured ? John J. Downey , one of the troopers , was killed . Meanwhile at Russelton , six miles away , Salvatore Accorsi , according to several witnesses , had been busy repairing his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road in the car . He was stopped by some of the raiding troopers who were searching for the murderer of Downey , questioned , and then permitted to go on . Accorsi continued to live in Russelton , unmolested , for eight months following the murder . Then , since he was out of work and had been evicted from his home by the Republic Iron and Steel Company , he moved to Staten Island with his wife . Meantime , at the coroner 's inquest , the troopers who took part in the raid on the meeting swore that they did not know who fired the shot which killed Downey . Almost two years passed . In June , 1929 , W. M. Brown , one of the State troopers , remembered with miraculous clearness that it was Salvatore Accorsi who had shot Downey . Accorsi was found in Staten Island , living with his wife and children  --  two of them born since the Cheswick raid  --  and working as a day laborer . He was indicted for murder , and extradited to Pennsylvania where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him . We hope that both will be forthcoming . T HE PROMOTION of Colonel Patrick J. Hurley , Assistant Secretary of War , to the headship of the War Department places in charge of the military forces of the country one who himself fought with distinction as major and lieutenant-colonel in the World War . The press has made much of the fact that he is the first citizen of the old Indian Territory , now Oklahoma , ever to enter the Cabinet . This is interesting , of course . Far more important is the question , which can not now be answered , how much of a militarist he is . It was very much to the credit of the late Secretary , Mr. Good , that he refused to make jingo speeches and showed a general disinclination to let himself be used as the mouthpiece of the War Department militarists . We sincerely trust that Colonel Hurley will profit by this example . A man of large means , a founder of the United States Chamber of Commerce , a bank president for several years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ardent advocate of a change in our military situation . Yet the very fact that he is a man of affairs must create the hope that he will loyally support the President in his desire to cut down the tremendous expense to which the government is now put for our needless military and naval burdens . F ROM VARE TO GRUNDY ? what a fate for Pennsylvania ! No sooner is the former again rejected by the Senate and welcomed back to Philadelphia by 2,000 of his supporters who greet him with " We are back of you , Bill , " than the Governor must needs offer the vacant Senatorship to Joseph Grundy , prince of tariff lobbyists . And in a way Grundy merits it . No one has worked harder for the manufacturers of Pennsylvania who own the State . No one living has , we suppose , raised more money for the Republican Party than he who poured $800,000 into the Coolidge campaign fund and $1,000,000 ? one-tenth of all that was raised to elect him  --  into Herbert Hoover 's campaign treasury . Are these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of prosperity and unlimited campaign funds to exalt the man who can rake in the cash at election time more expertly than anyone else ? Ought we not to have on the floor of the Senate the man who declares for tariff walls so high that not a single foreign manufactured article which is also made in Pennsylvania can surmount them and enter this country ? Let us by all means have in official life a champion of the tariff ultimate  --  the logical conclusion of the whole tariff fraud . There he will be in propria persona , a monument to the extent to which rapacity , selfish greed , and special privilege will go  --  and , incidentally , an illustration of the type of men with whose aid our statesmen like Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover are willing to pay their way into the Presidency . R AMSAY MACDONALD , in marked contrast to President Hoover , has chosen , beside himself , three delegates to represent England at the coming naval disarmament conference who are determinedly anti-war  --  even pacifists . They are A. V. Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary for Foreign Affairs , and Captain Wedgwood Benn , Secretary for India . A veteran of Gallipoli and a distinguished flier on the Italian front , Captain Benn is a consistent advocate of no more war . He is , however , as determined a fighter for his beliefs as any man now in the House of Commons . Arthur Henderson , unlike MacDonald , chose to take part in the conduct of the war , but no one can question his eagerness now to advance the cause of peace at every point . As for Mr. Alexander , he is a refreshing person to have at the head of a naval department for he , too , is devoted to the making of a warless world . Finally , Mr. MacDonald himself may be expected to do his uttermost to achieve something really worth while . Again we regret that Mr. Hoover 's delegation contains several convinced militarists who can not be other than lukewarm in their espousal of a genuine disarmament program . PRESIDENT HOOVER RECOMMENDS that the Federal Power Commission be composed of full-time commissioners in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agriculture , and that the commission be given certain regulatory authority in cases of interstate transmission of power , though he would guard jealously the powers of State commissions . The importance of the commission 's work is little realized . Its accounting division , in particular , ought now to be laying securely the foundations of the future rate structure , but it will not be allowed to do so if its work is transferred to untrained accountants outside the commission , as was proposed in the notorious confidential memorandum of last summer and as has been urged by the commission 's executive secretary . A series of striking articles by Drew Pearson in recent issues of the Baltimore Sun has given extracts from an unpublished report of the commission 's accountants showing the overcapitalization of certain power companies . According to this report the Niagara Falls Power Company , for example , the great New York concern in which J. P. Morgan and Company have become heavily interested , claims " a fair value " of more than $77 , - 000,000 on an actual investment of not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need of an adequate , trained accounting force for the Power Commission if rates in future are to rest on actual investment , as was the purpose of Congress , and not on the capitalization of hoped-for earnings , as is the accepted business practice . S O THE UNITED STATES has finally signed its name to three protocols which provide for the membership of this country in the World Court . These must in turn be submitted to the Senate for ratification , which will probably be delayed . Thus begins a new chapter in our relations with the rest of the world , the worth of which must be tested by time . Our readers are aware of The Nation 's attitude on the World Court . We have never been enthusiastic about it and have always regretted the failure at Paris to build on the Hague Court rather than to institute a new one so clearly allied with the League of Nations . The American reservations have seemed to us , moreover , to devitalize the court not a little ; we have opposed every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on an equal footing  --  as we have insisted that to be a real world court it should have universal jurisdiction . As it is , we can not become excited about our adherence to this new tribunal , but can only hope that the court may confound its critics and become in the course of time and its evolution the kind of court which the world needs and ought to have . F LOOD CONTROL is still a live question in the Mississippi Valley , and is likely to remain such until the government gets further ahead with its plans for keeping the flood waters within bounds . " Conflict of opinion .. . over the proposed floodway from the Arkansas River to the Gulf of Mexico , " Mr. Hoover told Congress in his message , had led him to " withhold construction upon this portion of the Mississippi flood control plan until it could be again reviewed by the engineers for any further recommendation to Congress . " This seems to suggest that the old controversy between the army engineers and the Mississippi River Commission is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover recommends an increase from $30,000,000 to $35,000,000 in appropriations for the next fiscal year for other portions of the great undertaking . The opening of a nine-foot channel in the Ohio River is to be followed by the development of other parts of the Mississippi River system for barge and steamboat traffic . In Missouri , at least , the federal courts appear to be doing their part in expediting the flood control project by refusing to allow insurance companies and others to obstruct the expropriation of land for levees and other necessary purposes . " If another great flood catches the valley unprepared , " says the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , " and it is again necessary for the Red Cross to rally the people everywhere to the relief of the homeless and starving , it will be the fault of those who feel themselves injured by the government control plan . " " A LL THE LIVING MEMBERS of the jury which convicted Thomas J. Mooney in the bombing of the Preparedness Day parade " in San Francisco in 1916 , an Associated Press dispatch announces , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the former labor leader . " The list has been completed by the action of J. W. Miller , the only juror who held out against clemency , in writing to Governor Young urging a pardon on the ground that the testimony upon which the verdict was based was " of doubtful character . " Under ordinary circumstances it would seem difficult , if not impossible , for any governor to hold out against the weight of testimony and appeal which has been built up about the Mooney case , and even those who are most reluctant to believe that the war is over and that no great disaster at arms now threatens the country might well exert themselves to clear California of its uncivilized taint . A good many Americans pat themselves on the back and thank God that they are not like other people when reports of political persecution or judicial tyranny come from the Balkans or Russia , but a glaring political , judicial , and administrative crime is being perpetrated in California , one of the sovereign States of " God 's country , " without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business community rising in revolt . T HE SPECIAL CONVENTION of the International Ladies Garment Workers , now being held in Cleveland , marks the end of the communist control of this union and probably of the influence of the Workers Party in the needle trades unions of New York City . The internal conflict in the union of cloak , suit , and dressmakers in the past seven years has brought disruption within the organization and complete loss of control over the industry . All of the progress since 1910 , which had made the Ladies Garment Workers one of the strongest and most progressive trade unions of the country , was dissipated in the struggle for political supremacy and for the acceptance of alternative economic dogma . Steps to rehabilitate the union began early this year with the return of Benjamin Schlesinger to the presidency of the organization . He was faced with a bankrupt treasury , a cynical and discouraged membership , and an industry in which all vestige of union power had disappeared . With the aid of public officials such as Governor Roosevelt and Lieutenant-Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as impartial chairman , stuck by his post during the darkest days of an unwise strike , the first steps were taken toward the establishment of union control in the cloak and suit industry . The task is not easy . The return of the small shop and the irresponsible employer , and the wide geographical dispersal of the industry , are the obstacles that now face the union . The progress it has in this short time made in the cloak and suit industry , and the public interest and sympathy it has enlisted in its battle for recognition and decent labor standards , promise a successful outcome of the strikes which are now being planned in Cleveland . T HE YOUNG PLAN or national bankruptcy is the alternative which Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , president of the Reichsbank , holds out to Germany in a memorandum which was made public on December 5 . Dr. Schacht signed the Young committee report , he declares , with the understanding that its recommendations were to be accepted by all the Powers concerned , and that the financial and economic activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed by the plan could be borne . Not only have six months passed without evidence that these stipulations are being regarded , but additional burdens are being proposed for Germany , among them the relinquishment of a claim to 400,000,000 marks on account of payments made under the Dawes Plan to September 1 , the payments under the Young Plan dating from April 21 last ; the abandonment of the claim to 300,000,000 marks of unliquidated German property in England which Mr. Snowden proposes to retain ; the agreement regarding Belgian marks , negotiated outside the Young Plan ; and the renunciation of claims to German property in Poland provided for in a trade agreement between the two countries . On the other hand France , which has not been enthusiastic about the Young Plan , has raised again the question of sanctions in the event that Germany defaults in its payments . The situation seems likely to provoke some more plain speaking when the conference at The Hague reassembles to put the Young Plan into effect . C HIANG KAI-SHEK 'S star is sinking , and the allied generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China seems to face , instead of the often-prophesied dictatorship , another of those eras of decentralized government in which local war-lords administer , as more or less independent satraps , their little local kingdoms . But the impulse which the Nationalist movement gave China has not been wholly lost ; it has had its effect upon the customs administration , and it is so strong in the hearts of China 's four hundred millions that even today the generals who are denouncing Chiang Kai-shek are reasserting their loyalty to the principles of Sun Yat-Sen and asking for the return of Wang Ching-wei . Wang was a sort of spiritual son of Dr. Sun , a passionate orator , a genuine idealist ; he lacks , however , Chiang 's driving energy and administrative ability . He is no man to organize a new China , but he is the man to keep the Three People 's Principles alive . Chiang , in his enthusiasm to build a strong government , ruthlessly put down all opposition , crushing the labor unions and students ' organizations upon which , as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Accordingly he destroyed the spiritual momentum of his own movement . He had long been unpopular but the prestige of success still surrounded him . But when he was forced to a humiliating capitulation to Russia on the Chinese Eastern question Chiang " lost face , " and the rebellion , so long latent , took heart all over China . Y OUNG MR . RUDY VALLEE sang over the radio the other night . The hour was nine o'clock ; so confident was the broadcasting company of Mr. Vallee 's popularity that a vast hook-up involving forty stations was arranged for the program ( almost as many as Al Smith got in the late presidential campaign ) ; Mr. Vallee announced at the close of his program  --  at 9:30 p. m. ? that he would be pleased to give an autographed photograph of himself to any lady ( or perhaps even any gentleman ) who asked for one . In the eight o'clock mail the next morning there were 600 letters asking for pictures ; thousands more came during the day . Mr. Vallee 's " fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . The young gentleman in question left Yale two years ago ; he is probably under twenty-five years of age . But thanks to our modern methods of publicity , millions of persons know his name and , more wonderful still , have heard his voice . We deduce , therefore , that it takes about two years to make a hero . At that rate , with our new and improved system of spreading sound and the printed word , the crop of heroes should increase rapidly ? but of course no particular hero may expect long to retain his position of eminence . He must give place to the new idol . If millions adore Mr. Vallee today , they will , owing to the well-known fickleness of human nature , grow tired of him tomorrow . Two years will become too long ; indeed , one Charles A. Lindbergh became a national hero overnight . The day will probably come when our heroes are fed to us on a moving belt , by mass production , each one guaranteed to last as long as need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied , who cares ?
