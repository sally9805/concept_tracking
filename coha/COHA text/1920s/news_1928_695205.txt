It is interpreted as another step in the campaign of the Federal Reserve banks to check excessive speculation . Whether the other Reserve banks will act remains to be seen , but it is recalled that on two former occasions this rear advances of rediscount rates initiated by the Chicago bank have been rather promptly followed by the others . In fact , the Federal Reserve authorities have let Chicago take the lead in rate adjustments since the much-criticized episode last Autumn , when the Reserve Board forced the Chicago institution to lower its rate against the judgment of the directors . Expressed Fears of Inflation . The Chicago bank was ordered to lower its rediscount rate on Sept. 27 , 1927 , after the New York and several other institutions had cut their rates . The reason given at that time was that easy money rates in this country would force American gold abroad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies and return to the gold basis . But the directors of the Chicago bank protested that abnormally low rates would encourage inflation and excessive speculation in securities . The booming stock market so clearly fulfilled their predictions that the Federal Reserve Board reversed its policy and started to tighten up credit . The Chicago bank advanced its rediscount rate to 4 per cent . on Jan. 25 and to 41/2 per cent . on April 20 . The other banks followed . The new 5 per cent . rate is the highest since the post-war deflation period . The Chicago rate held unchanged at 4 per cent . from June , 1924 , to last September .

WASHINGTON , ' July ** increase in the rediscount rate at Chicago is understood here to be a direct outcome of speculative activity , and is accepted as another attempt on the part of the Reserve System to curtail the volume of money used in stock market transactions . It is believed that the increase of $100,000,000 in brokers ' loans registered last week as compared with a decline of $400,000,000 in such loans in the preceding four weeks ' period had something to do with the action of the Chicago bank . The rediscount rates between August , 1922 , and the beginning of the increases that became effective last January ranged from 31/2 to 4 per cent . The Chicago rate of 5 per cent . will be the highest rediscount charge maintained by any bank in the Federal Reserve System since Aug. 15 , 1922 , when Minneapolis reduced its rate from 5 to 41/2 per cent . Earlier in 1922 , the Minneapolis and Dallas Reserve banks had maintained 51/2 rates for brief periods . Seven other reserve banks  --  Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco and Kansas City  --  established the 5 per cent . rate on Jan. 1 , 1922 , but dropped to a rate of 41/2 per cent . in a comparatively short time . Advance as Viewed Here . Establishment of the highest American rediscount rate since the end of the post-war deflation period , contained in the announcement yes- terday that the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago had moved its rate up to 5 per cent. , overshadowed all other considerations in Wall Street , where the credit situation has been a dominating influence , both in stock market and banking circles , for many weeks . The advance was regarded as one of the most significant moves made by the Federal Reserve authorities in their campaign , waged since the first of the year , to check the speculation that has been reflected in the doubling of the indebtedness of the member banks of the country to the Federal Reserve Banks in the last year at the same time that more than $1,180,000,000 was being added to the total of loans to brokers . While there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the other regional institutions , it has been the invariable rule in recent years that readjustments in one pivotal centre have been quickly reflected in the others . Bankers said yesterday that the first effect here of the Chicago action undoubtedly would be to draw money from New York to Chicago to take advantage of the higher return in the latter market , and at the same time to throw an added burden on the rediscounting facilities of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . If such a situation is prolonged , an advance in the rediscount rate here would be inevitable , according to bankers . Action Held Up Eleven Days . The last time that a 5 per cent . rediscount rate had prevailed in this country was in August , 1922 , and this followed a high record of 7 per cent. , which prevailed in the latter part of 1920 and early in 1921 . The most significant feature of the Chicago action , in the opinion of Wall Street leaders , was the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eleven days after it had been decided on by the directors of the Chicago Reserve Bank . On June 29 the directors voted for the advance in the rate , such action being subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington . This sanction was given yesterday , and the instant conclusion reached here was that the authorities did not wish announcement of a rediscount rate advance to be made until the new financing of the United States Treasury Department had been concluded . The Treasury last week offered 3250.000,000 of new 3% per cent . bonds , which were heavily oversubscribed , and at the same time invited the surrender of Third Liberty 4L per cent . bonds in exchange for new 334ts as part of the refunding of the third Liberty loan . Subscription books have been closed on the cash offering , but the exchange privilege remains open . The fact that it was considered desirable to hold back the rate announcement such a length of time was regarded in Wall Street as a definite indication that officials believe stiff money rates are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chicago advance announced yesterday was the third made this year by that bank , and on both previous occasions it has been followed by a general readjustment throughout the system . On Jan. 25 , the Chicago rate was moved up from 31/2 to 4 per cent . and on April 20 it was advanced to 41/2 per cent . The New York rate , which now stands at 41/Et per cent. , was advanced from 31A to 4 per cent . on Feb. 3 and to its present level on May 18 . . Bankers said yesterday that the figures of the Federal Reserve System covering credit factors furnished a complete explanation of the Chicago bank 's action . The total of hills discounted by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks of the system , which represents the amount of credit obtained by the commercial banks from the Reserve banks , stood last week at $1.191,010.000 , which compared with $1.031.874.000 in the previous week and $506,768,000 in the corresponding week of last year . At the same time , brokers ' loans were shown in the latest statement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,126 , - 327.000 a year ago . This called attention to the recent warning by Charles E. Mitchell , President of the National City Bank , who said a week ago that the heavy borrowing of the banks through rediscrneating , and their relending of the money : Nri stock and bond collateral , which is not rediscountable at the Reserve bank , was reducing the liquidity of the banks and was creating a situation which , if not actually dangerous , at least reflected a trend that was unfortunate . The Federal Reserve policy since the first of the year has been directed toward correcting that situation . Outflow of Gold Affects Money . Money this year also has been affected by a heavy outflow of gold , particularly to France , and the Federal Reserve authorities have done nothing to neutralize this restriction of credit . More than $500,000,000 of gold has been shipped abroad since the movement started late last year . At the s'art of last week the cornbinetion of gold losses , increased rediscounting and sales of Government securities by the Federal Reserve Banks sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest since November , 1920 , and high records also have been established in time money rates , commercial paper and other branches of the money market . After the passing of the midyear strain rates have eased off , and call loans were quoted yesterday at 6 per cent . Announcement of the Chicago advance was received here after the close of the stock market , and hence hae no effect on prices . Early in the year the stock market held out stubbornly in the face of the restrictive credit policies of the Federal Reserve authorities , but last month prices broke sharply under a heavy volume of liquidation . This month , however , prices have held fairly firmly . In foreign exchange , in which trading is continued until late in the afternoon , the Chicago advance was chiefly responsible for a decline in sterling exchange to as lowest point of this year , $4.85 13-16 . This was a loss for the day of more than half a cent and was based on the theory that high money rates in this coun try would draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local conditions in Chicago forced the rate change , as discounting has been climbing steadily there and the reserve ratio has been declining . Last week 's statement of the twelve Reserve Banks combined showed a reserve ratio of 65.4 per cent. , as against 68.7 the previous week and 76.8 a year ago . The New York Reserve Bank 's reserve ratio is 63.5 per cent. , against 69.8 a week ago and 83 a year ago .
