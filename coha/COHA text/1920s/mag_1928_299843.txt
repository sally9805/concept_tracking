The 96th annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , at Glasgow last week , was a grand concourse of ideas on chemistry , physics , psychology , mathematics , geology . So specialized and abstruse were most of the papers read in 13 sectional meetings that the 3,000 scientists attending ( from all the continents ) were eager to get the Glasgow newspapers for popularized reports of what was happening in fields other than their own . However there was a strong thread of thought running through all the discussions : the application of science in industry . <P> " Craftsmanship &lt;fc Science . " New president of the B. A. A. S. ( to succeed Sir Arthur Keith ) is Sir William Henry Bragg , director of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory at the University of London . His greatest contribution to science is his use of x-rays to describe and measure the atoms and molecules of crystals . As is expected of new B. A. A. S. presidents , Sir William stated his scientific credo : " There are some who think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern science would destroy reverence and faith . I do not know how that can be said of the student who stands daily in the presence of what seems to him to be the Infinite . Science is not setting forth to destroy the soul , but to keep body and soul together . " In this he took a view opposite to that of retiring President Sir Arthur Keith , who at Leeds last year emphasized the finity of human effort ( TIME , Sept. 12 , 1927 ) . <P> But that credo was almost an aside in President Bragg 's address . He dwelt much more on craftsmanship and science . British scientists are less aware of industry 's needs than are their U. S. colleagues . The academic and the workaday are more separate there than here . Hence Sir William was obliged to exhort : " The plain truth is that modern craftsmanship , with all its noise and ugliness , is giving food , clothing , warmth and interest to millions who otherwise must die . In all honesty let us recognize that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor , aviation ; chemical , electrical industries all need and use scientific research . But British factories are sluggards in their support of science ; not so U. S. factories . <P> President Bragg 's scientific audience ( 3,000 people ) thus stirred to think of science 's relation to industry , spent the week-end of their convention inspecting shipyards and factories around Glasgow . <P> Educated Industrialists . As everyone from the U. S. knew , it was flattery for Charles Wilfrid Valentine , professor of education at the University of Birmingham , to say that the best brains of the U. S. are attracted to business and the second and third best to the professions . But he , bitter against the educational recalcitrancy of England , wanted to make a point against the " hard-dying social stigma which attaches to being in trade " in England . He wants English young men to study for business . Present British industrialists he holds in contempt . Many lack wits enough to be army corporals , he exaggerated , exasperated .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
