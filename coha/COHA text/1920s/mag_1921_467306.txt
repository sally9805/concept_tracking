HOW closely every crack and corner of nature is packed with life , especially in our northern temperate zone ! I was impressed with this fact when during several June days I was occupied with road mending on the farm where I was born . To open up the loosely piled and decaying laminated rocks was to open up a little biological and zoological museum , so many of our smaller forms of life harbored there . From chipmunks to ants and spiders , animal life flourished . We disturbed the chipmunks in their den a foot and a half or more beneath the loosely piled rocks . There were two of them in a soft , warm nest of dry , shredded maple leaves . They did not wait to be turned out of doors , but when they heard thc racket overhead bolted precipitately . Two living together surprised me , as heretofore I have never known but one in a den . Near them a milk snake had stowed himself away in a crevice , and in the little earthquake which we set up got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long had also found harbor there . The ants rushed about in great consternation when their eggs were suddenly exposed . In fact , there was live natural history under every stone about us . Some children brought me pieces of stone , which they picked up close by , that sheltered a variety of cocoon-building spiders . One small , dark-striped spider was carrying about her . ball of eggs , the size of a large pea , attached to the hind part of her body . This became detached , when she seized it eagerly and bore it about held between her legs . Another fragment of stone , the size of one 's hand , sheltered the chrysalisof some species of butterfly which was attached to it at its tail . It was surprising to see this enshrouded creature , blind and deaf , wriggle and thrash about as if threatening us with its wrath for invading its sanctuary . One would about as soon expect to see an egg protest . Thus the naturalist finds his pleasures everywhere . Every solitude to him is peopled . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ear . The born naturalist is one of the most lucky men in the world . Winter or summer , rain or shine , at home or abroad , walking or riding , his pleasures are always near at hand . The great book of nature is open before him and he has only to turn the leaves . A friend sitting on my porch in a hickory rocking-chair the other day was annoyed by one of our small , solitary wasps that seemed to want to occupy the chair . It held a small worm in its legs . She would " shoo " it away , only to see it back in a few seconds . I assured her that it did not want to sting her , but that its nest was somewhere in the chair . And , sure enough , as soon as she quieted down it entered a small opening in the end of one of the chair arms , and deposited its worm , and presently was back with another , and then a third and a fourth ; and before the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed up the opening . My morning walk up to the beech wood of ten brings me new knowledge and new glimpses of nature . This morning I saw a humming bird taking its bath in the big dewdrops on a small ash tree . I have seen other birds bathe in the dew or raindrops on tree foliage , but did not before know that the hummer bathed at all . I also discovered that the webs of the little spiders in the road , when saturated with moisture , as they were from the early fog this morning , exhibit prismatic tints . Every thread of the web was strung with minute spherules of moisture , and they displayed all the tints of the rainbow . In each of them I saw one abutment of a tiny rainbow . When I stepped a pace or two to the other side , I saw the other abutment . Of course I could not see the completed bow in so small an area . These fragments are as unapproachable as the bow in the clouds . I also saw that where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tints , you can see only one at a time ? to the right or left of you . It also is a fragment of a rainbow . Those persons who report beholding a great display of prismatic effects in the foliage of trees or in the grass after a shower , are not to be credited . You may see the drops glistening in the sun like glass beads , but they will not exhibit prismatic tints . In only one at a time will you see rainbow tints . Change your position , and you may see another , but never a great display of prismatic tints at one time . In my walk the other morning I turned over a stone , looking for spiders , and ants . These I found , and in addition there were two cells of one of our solitary leaf-cutters , which we as boys called " sweat bees , " because they came around us and would alight on our sweaty hands and arms as if in quest of salt , as they probably were . It is about the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its abdomen is yellow and very flexible . It carries its pollen on its abdomen and not upon its thighs . These cells were of a greenish-brown color ; each of them was like a miniature barrel in which the pollen with the egg of the bee was sealed up . When the egg hatches , the grub finds a loaf of bread at hand for its nourishment . These little barrels were each headed up with adozen circular bits of leaves cut as with a compass , exactly fitting the cylinder , one upon the other . The wall of the cylinder was made up of oblong cuttings from leaves , about half an inch wide , and three-quarters of an inch long , a dozen of them lapped over one another , and fitted together in the most workmanlike manner . In my boyhood I occasionally saw this bee cutting out her nesting material . Her mandibles worked like perfect shears . When she had cut out her circular , or her oblong patches , she rolled them up , and , holding them between her legs , flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into little openings in old rails , or old posts . About the period of hatching , I do not know . I published not long ago an article in one of the leading magazines on the rainbow , in which I discussed another phenomenon known as the sun drawing water , and pointed out how it is as illusive and unapproachable as the rainbow . The beholder always stands exactly in front of its middle ? that is , of its vertical rays , and sees one half of it on his right hand and one half on his left , and he can not by moving either way change this relation . When the sun is half an hour or more high , its rays spread out widely at a very acute angle . As it mounts in the heavens the rays are pulled up , so to speak , and assume a different aspect . But always it is the shape of a huge fan opened out to about fourfifths of its capacity , as it usually is when the holder uses it . Take the ordinary folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as wide in proportion , and fancy it hung up in the sky , and you have a fairly accurate representation of this phenomenon . Numerous correspondents , among them university physicists , wrote me that I deceived myself ; that the rays are really parallel ; they cited the case of the railway track on which , when we stand where we can see a long , level stretch of the lines of the rails , we seem to see them converge t ill on the horizon they fairly meet . But one lameness of this explanation , if there were no other , is seen in the fact that you can outflank the railway lines , as you can any other system of parallel lines drawn upon the earth 's surface , but you can not outflank the lines made by the sun drawing water . They persist exactly in your front , no matter how fast or how far you go . Why they converge to these openings in the clouds , as if the sun itself was just there behind them , instead of being over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was deluged with explanations alleged to be founded upon the laws of perspective , but the main fact was entirely missed or ignored ? namely , that the apparition was , as I have said , always exactly in your front , the same as in the case of the rainbow . It must be remembered that these lines in the air are on a vertical plane and not on a horizontal . They are probably a mile or more long , and the beholder is usually a mile or more away , and stands in the shade of the clouds . Big and little are all one with nature . Perfect rainbows are seen on the surface of lakes and rivers , caused by the minute drops or spherules of fog left on the surface . I see rainbows in the spiders ' webs in the roads on a clear morning after a fog . Every thread of the web is strung with these minute spheres of vapor . Tyndall says , in his paper on the rainbow , that a line drawn from the sun to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same point , always makes an angle of forty-one degrees , and this fact of itself shows how unchangeable our relations to such phenomena are . Swallows , in hawking through the air for insects , do not snap their game up as do the true flycatchers . Their mouths are little nets which they drive through the air with the speed of airplanes . A few mornings ago the air was cold , but it contained many gauzy , fuzzy insects from the she of mosquitoes down to gnats . They kept near the ground . I happened to be sitting on the sunny sideof a rock and saw the swallows sweep past . One came by within ten feet of me and drove straight on to a very conspicuous insect which disappeared in his open mouth like a flash . how many hundreds or thousands of such insects they must devour each day ! Then think of how many insects the flycatchers and warblers and other insect-eating birds must consume in the course of a season ! The State Agricultural Society of Kansas estimates the bird population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far out of the way , but that they destroy every year 576,000,000 pounds of insects is a gross exaggeration . At least half of this bird population are seed eaters , which would cut this estimate to about 280,000,000 pounds . The other half , the flycatchers , the warblers , and so on , are here only about one-third of the year , which would again greatly reduce the estimate . Two hundred million pounds would be a very liberal estimate , reducing the reputed 480 trains of fifty box cars each , or 24,000 cars containing 24,000 pounds to the car , to much less than half that number and amount . But even this would save many millions of dollars annually to the Kansas farmers . We little suspect how the woods and wayside places swarm with life . We see little of it unless we watch and wait . The wild creatures are cautious about revealing themselves , their enemies are on the lookout for them . Certain woods at night are alive with flying squirrels which , except for some accident , we never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? skunks , foxes , coons , minks , and owls ? yes , and mice . The wild mice we rarely see . The little shrew mole , which I know is active at night , I have never seen but once . I once set a trap , called the delusion trap , in the woods by some rocks where I had no reason to suspect there were more mice than elsewhere , and two mornings later it was literally packed full of mice , half a dozen or more . Turn over a stone in the fields and behold the consternation among the small folk beneath it ? ants , slugs , bugs , worms , spiders ? all objecting to the full light , of day , not because their deeds arc evil , but because the instinct of selfpreservation prompts this course . As I write these sentences a chipmunk , who has his den in the bank by the roadside near by , is very busy storing up some half-ripe currants which grew on a bush a few yards away . Of course the currants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb him ; the seeds will keep , and they are what he is after . In the early summer , before any of the nuts and grains are ripened , the high cost of living among the lesser rodents is very great , and they resort to all sorts of makeshifts . In regard to this fullness of life in the bidden places of nature , Darwin says as much of the world as a whole : Well may we affirm that every part of the world is inhabitable . Whether lakes of brine or those subterranean ones hidden beneath volcanic mountains ? warm mineral springs ? the wide expanse and depth of the ocean , the upper regions of the atmosphere , and even the surface of perpetual snow ? all support organic beings . Never before was there such a lover of natural history as Darwin . In the earth , in the air , in the water , in the rocks , in the sand , in the mud ? he scanned the great biological record of the globe as it was never scanned before . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to his stores of natural knowledge . He would leave the comfortable ship while it was making its surveys , and make journeys of hundreds of miles on horseback through rough and dangerous regions to glean new facts . Grass and water for his mules . and geology or botany or zoology or anthropology for himself , and he was happy . At a great altitude in the Andes the people had shortness of breath which they called " puma , " and they ate onions to correct it . Darwin says , with a twinkle in his eye , " For my part I found nothing so good as the fossil shells . " His Beagle voyage is a regular magazine of natural history knowledge . Was any country ever before so searched and sifted for its biological facts ? In lakes and rivers , in swamps , in woods ? everywhere his insatiable eye penetrated . One re -- reads him always with a different purpose in view . If you happen to be interested in insects , you read him for that ; if in birds , you read him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reptiles , in volcanoes , in anthropology ? you read him with one of these subjects in mind . I recently had in mind the problem of the soaring condor , and I. reread him fur that , and , sure enough , he had studied and mastered that subject , too . If you are interested in seeing how the biological characteristics of the two continents , North and South America , agree or contrast with each other , you will find what you wish to know . You will learn that in South America the lightning hugs and glow worms of many kinds are the same as in North America ; that the beetle , or elater , when placed upon its back , snaps itself up in the air and falls upon its feet , as our species does ; that the obscene fungus , or Phallus , taints the tropical forests , as a similar species at times taints our dooryards and pasture borders ; and that the mud-dauber wasps stuff their clay cells with half-dead spiders for their young , the same as in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plant life , but not many . The influence of environment in modifying species is constantly in his mind . The naturalist can content himself with a day of little things . If he can read only a word of one syllable in the book of nature he will make the most of that . I read such a word the other morning when I perceived , while watching a young but fully fledged junco , or snowbird , that its markings were like those of the vesper sparrow . The young of birds always for a brief period repeat the markings of the birds of the parent stern from which they are an offshoot . Thus , the young of our robins have speckled breasts , betraying their thrush kinship . And the young junco shows in its striped appearance of breast and back , and the lateral white quills in the tail , its kinship to the grass finch or vesper sparrow , The slate color soon obliterates most of these signs , but the white quills remain . It has departed from the nesting habits of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open fields , but the junco chooses a mossy bank or tussock by the roadside , or in the woods , and constructs a very artistic nest of dry grass and hair which is so well hidden that the passerby seldom detects it . Another small word I read about certain of the rocks in my native Catskills ? a laminated , blue-gray sandstone ? that when you have split them open with steel wedges and a big hammer , or blown them up with dynamite ? instead of the gray fresh surface of the rock greeting you , it is often a surface of red mud , as if the surface had been enameled or electrotyped with mud . It appears to date from the first muddy day of creation . I have such an one for my doorstone at Woodchuck Lodge . It is amusing to see the sweepers and scrubbers of doorstones fall upon it with soap and hot water , and utterly fail to make any impression upon it . Nowhere else have I seen rocks casehardened with primal mud . The fresh-water origin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are all interested students of the weather , but the naturalist studies it for some insight into the laws which govern it . One season I made my reputation as a weather prophet by predicting on the first day of December a very severe winter . It was an easy guess . I saw in Detroit a bird from the far north , a bird I had never before seen , the Bohemian VOL . CXLII. ? No 852. - 100waxwing , or chatterer . It breeds above the Arctic circle and is common to both hemispheres . I said , When the Arctic birds come down , be sure there is a cold wave behind them . And so it proved . When the birds fail to give one a hint of the probable character of the coming winter , what reliable signs remain ? These remain : When December is marked by sudden and violent extremes of heat and cold , the winter will be broken ; the cold will not hold . 1 have said elsewhere that the hum of the bee in December is the requiem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaced , the cold slowly and steadily increasing through November and December ? no hurry , no violence ? then be prepared for a snug winter . As to wet and dry summers , one can always be guided by the rainfall on the Pacific coast ? a shortage on the western coast means an excess on the eastern . For four or five years past California has been short of its rainfall ? so much so that quite general alarm is felt over the gradual shrinkage of their stored-up supplies , the dams and reservoirs ; and during the summer seasons the parts of New England and New York with which I am acquainted have had very wet seasons ? floods in midsummer , and full springs and wells at all times . The droughts have been temporary and local . We say , " As fickle as the weather , " but the meteorological laws are pretty well defined . All signs fail in a drought , and all signs fail in a wet season . At one time the south wind brings no rain , at another time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex of conditions over a continental area of rivers and lakes and mountain chains is too vast for us to decipher ; it inheres in the nature of things . It is one of the potencies and possibilities which matter possesses . We can take no step beyond that . There seems to me to be false reasoning in the argument from analogy which William James uses in his lectures on " Human Immortality . " The brain , he admits , is the organ of the mind , but the mind may only sustain the relation to it , he says , which the wire sustains to the electric current which it transmits , or which the pipe sustains to the water which it conveys . Now the source and origin of the electric current is outside the wire that transmits it , and it could sustain no other than a transient relation to any outside material through which it passed . But if we know anything , we know that the human mind or spirit is a vital part of the human body ; its source is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ through which it is manifested are essentially one . The analogy of the brain to the battery , or dynamo in which the current originates , is the only logical or permissible one . Maeterlinck wrote wisely when he said : The insect does not belong to our world . The other animals , the plants even , notwithstanding their dumb life , and the great secrets which they cherish , do not seem wholly foreign to us . In spite of all we feel a surt of earthly brotherhood with them . . . . There is something , on the other hand , about the insect that does not belong to the habits , the ethics , the psychology of our globe . One would be inclined to say that the insect comes from another planet , more monstrous , more energetic , more insane , more atrocious , more infernal than our own . Certainly more cruel and monstrous than our own . Among the spiders , for instance , the female eats the male and often devours her own young . The scorpion does the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land animals outside the insect world . The insects certainly live in a wonderland of which we have little conception . All our powers are tremendously exaggerated in these little people . Their power makes them acquainted with the inner molecular constitution of matter far more intimately than we can becomeby our coarse chemical analysis . Our world is agitated by vibrations , coarse and fine , of which our senses can take in only the slower ones . If they exceed three thousand a second , they become too shrill for our ears . It is thought that the world of sound with the insects begins where ours leaves off . The drums and tubes of insects ' ears are very minute . What would to us be a continuous sound is to them a series of separate blows . We begin to hear blows as continuous sounds when they amount to about thirty a second . The house fly has about , four thousand eye-lenses ; the cabbage butterfly , and the dragon fly , about seventeen thousand ; and some species of beetles have twenty-five thou-. sand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world the insect lives , thrilling and vibrating to a degree that would drive us insane . If we possessed the same microscopic vision , how would the aspect of the world be changed ! We might see a puff of smoke as a flock of small blue butterflies , or hear the hum of a mosquito as the blast of a trumpet . On the other hand , so much that disturbs us must escape the insects , because their senses are too fine to take it in . Doubtless they do not hear the thunder or feel the earthquake . The insects arc much more sensitive to heat and cold than we are , and for reasons . The number of waves in the ether that gives us the sensation of heat is three or four million millions a second . The number of tremors required to produce red light is estimated at four hundred and seventy-four million millions a second , and for the production of violet light , six hundred and ninety-nine million millions a second . No doubt the insects react to all these different degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them in touch with a world of which we are ouite oblivious . To how many things our lives have been compared ? to a voyage , with its storms and adverse currents and safe haven at last ; to a day with its morning , noon , and night ; to the seasons with their spring , summer , autumn , and winter ; to a game , a school , a battle . In one of his addresses to workingmen Huxley compared life to a game of chess . We must learn the names and the values and the moves of each piece , and all the rules of the game if we hope to play it successfully . The chessboard is the world , the pieces are the phenomena of the universe , the rules of the game are what we call the laws of nature . But it may be questioned if the comparison is a happy one . Life is not a game in this sense , a diversion , an aside , or a contest for victory over an opponent , except in isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in the mastery of life . Life is a day 's work , a struggle where the forces to be used and the forces to be overcome are much more vague and varied and intangible than are those of the chessboard . Life is cooperation with other lives . We win when we help others to win . I suppose business is more often like a game than is life ? your gain is often the other man 's loss , and you deliberately aim to outwit your rivals and competitors . But in a sane , normal life there is little that suggests a game of any kind . We must all have money , or its equivalent . There are the three things ? money , goods , labor ? and the greatest of these is labor . Labor is the sum of all values . The value of things is the labor it requires to produce or obtain them . Were gold plentiful and silver scarce , the latter would be the more precious . The men at the plow and the hoe and iu the mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nature what we all must have , and these things are none of them in the hands or under the guardianship of some one who is trying to keep us from obtaining them , or aiming to take our aids and resources from us . The chess simile has only a rhetorical value . The London workingmen to whom Huxley spoke would look around them in vain to find in their problems of life anything akin to a game of chess , or for any fruitful suggestion in the idea . They were probably mechanics , tradesmen , artisans , teamsters , boatmen , painters , and so on , and knew through experience the forces with which they had to deal . But how many persons who succeed in life have any such expert knowledge of the forces and conditions with which they have to deal , as two chess players have of the pawns and knights and bishops and queens of the chessboard ? Huxley was nearly always impressive and convincing , and there was vastly more logical force in his figures than in those of most writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has its source in a mountain or hillside spring , that has its pure and sparkling or foaming and noisy youth , then its quieter and stronger and larger volume , then its placid and gently moving current to the sea . Blessed is the life that is self-purifying , like the moving waters ; that lends itself to many noble uses , never breaking out of bounds and becoming a destructive force . I had a letter the other day from a man who wanted to know why the meadow or field mice gnawed or barked the apple trees when there was a deep coverlid of snow upon the ground . Was it because they found it difficult to get up through the deep , frozen snow to the surface to find seeds to eat ? He did not seem to know that meadow mice are not seed eaters , but that they live on grass and roots and keep well hidden beneath the ground during the day , when there is a deep fall of snow coming up out of their dens and retreats and leading a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cats , foxes , owls , and hawks . Life then becomes a sort of picnic . They build new nests on the surface of the ground and form new runways , and disport themselves apparently in a festive mood . The snow is their protection . They bark the trees and take their time . When the snow is gone , their winter picnic is at an end , and they retreat to their dens in the ground and beneath flat stones , and lead once more the life of fear . Sitting on my porch last spring , wrapped in my blanket , recovering from a slight indisposition , I was in a mood to be interested in the everyday aspects of nature before me ? in the white and purple lilacs , in the maple leaves nearly full grown , in the pendent fringe of the yellowish-white bloom of the chestnut and oak , in the new shoots of the grapevines , and so forth . All these things formed only a setting or background for the wild life near by . The birds are the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard me curiously in this great temple of trees . Wrens , chippies , robins , bluebirds , catbirds , redstarts , and now and then rarer visitants . A few days earlier , for a moment , a , mourning ground warbler suddenly appeared around the corner , on the ground , at the foot of the steps , and glanced hastily up at me . When I arose and looked over the railing , it had gone . Then the speckled Canada warbler came in the lilac bushes and syringa branches and gave me several good views . The bay-breasted warbler was reported in the evergreens up by the stone house , but he failed to report to me here at " The Nest . " But the female redstart came several times to the gravel walk below me , evidently looking for material to begin her nest . But the wren , the irrepressible house wren , was and is in evidence every few minutes , busy carrying nesting material into the box on the corner of the veranda . How intense and emphatic she is ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yesterday an interloper appeared . He or she climbed the post by the back way , as it were , and hopped out upon the top of the box and paused , as if to see that the coast was clear . He acted as if he felt himself an intruder . Quick as a flash there was a brown streak from the branch of a maple thirty feet away , and the owner of the box was after him . He did not stop to argue the case , but was off , hotly pursued . I must not forget the pair of wood thrushes that are building a nest in a maple fifty or more feet away . How I love to see them on the ground at my feet , every motion and gesture like music to the eye ! The head and neck of the male fairly glow , and there is something fine and manly about his speckled breast . A pair of catbirds have a nest in the barberry bushes on the south end of the house , and are in evidence at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laying of eggs begins , they keep out of the public eye as much as possible . From the front of the stage they retreat behind the curtain . One day as I sat here I heard the song of the olive-backed thrush down in the currant bushes below me . Instantly I was transported to the deep woods and the trout brooks of my native Catskills . I heard the murmuring water and felt the woodsy coolness of those retreats ? such magic hath associative memories ! A moment before a yellow-throated vireo sang briefly in the maple , a harsh note ; and the oriole with his insistent call added to the disquieting sounds . I have no use for the oriole . He has not one musical note , and in grape time his bill is red or purple with the blood of our grapes . But the most of these little people are my benefactors , and add another ray of sunshine to the May day . I shall not soon forget the spectacle of that rare little warbler peeping around the corner of the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mere studying of the birds , seeking mere knowledge of them , is not enough . You must live with the birds , so to speak ; have daily and seasonal associations with them before they come to mean much to you . Then , as they linger about your house or your camp , or as you see them in your walks , they are a part of your life , and help give tone and color to your day .
