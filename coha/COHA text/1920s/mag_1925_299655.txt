For the most part , the Arms Traffic Conference at Geneva ( TIME , May 11 , 18 ) fired on all its cylinders , but there were several cases of ignition trouble , and it was felt that the engine was untrustworthy and might at any time develop more serious defects . <P> Business for last week : <P> A U. S. proposal to strike revolvers from the list of controllable weapons was passed nem , con . <P> A British proposal to exclude warships , submarines , air-and seaplanes and airships from control was passed by a small majority . The U.S. voted to exclude . <P> An Italian proposal to exclude tanks was defeated . The U.S. voted to exclude . <P> An Italian proposal to exclude armored trains was tied three times . The U.S. voted to exclude . The proposal was subsequently approved in committee . <P> A U.S. proposal , interpolating in the definition of " arms " the words " designed for use in land , sea and aerial warfare , " was passed . <P> A Turkish proposal to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export of arms to any recognized Government was opposed and referred to committee . <P> The U. S. , through its representative , Congressman Theodore E. Burton of Ohio , announced its willingness to sign a convention providing for the publication of all armaments statistics . The offer was received with mixed feelings . Poland and Rumania dissented because of their proximity to Russia ( unrepresented at the Conference ) . The matter was ultimately referred to committee . <P> A Hungarian proposal to exclude flammenwerfen ( flame projectors ) from the list of controllable weapons was carried . Hungary pointed out that these weapons were already barred by International Law . The U. S. immediately moved a resolution to control all component parts . <P> A U.S. proposal permitting any Government to ship arms to any other Government was passed . Britain thereupon introduced an amendment giving Governments the right to search ships suspected of carrying arms designed to foment trouble against them , citing the case of India where arms-smuggling was the cause of constant strife on the Northwest Frontier . The amendment was badly received and discussion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six cylinders when Mr. Burton introduced a U.S. amendment , the significant part of which read : <P> " Upon the coming into force of the convention , the powers mentioned in Article 32 and blank for number other powers shall nominate representatives to form the central international office . These representatives shall , in accordance with provisions of the convention , determine the organization and functions of the central international board , including election of their successors at the end of their terms , which shall be three years . " <P> It was noted that the " League of Nations " nowhere appeared in the text , which seemed purposely designed to free the functions of the central office from the jurisdiction of the " League . Not a nation , with the exception of Canada , could accept the amendment ; and , after some lengthy polemics , the question was referred to committee . As a compromise , it was finally decided to have no central international office .                   @ @
