The Way of All Flesh ( Emil Jannings ) . Not Samuel Butler 's famed novel but Perley Poore Sheehan 's little-known story supplies the framework of the great German actor 's first U. S.-made film. * It concerns one August Schiller , who flourished in Milwaukee back in the days when gentlemen associated that town with beer , and when ladies carried muffs . The first half of the film shows him a pillar of society , plain , foursquare , sunk in a large family . A doting father of six , a pompous cashier in his bank , a champion bowler , he is admirable in all things , full of little unpricked vanities , and simply worshipful in an Olympian set of whiskers that obscure almost a half of his necktie but add immeasurably to his dignity . <P> The later scenes show him deflated and ennobled . His bank has sent him to Chicago to dispose of a batch of securities . There , taken in by the misleading lady ( Phillis Haver ) , he has lost successively his whiskers , sobriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world believes him the victim of bandits . Repentant , he obscures himself to preserve that illusion for the good name of his beloved children . Years later , the bedraggled old Zeus is pictured peeping through frost-dimmed windows to behold from his own shadowed squalor the riches and happiness of his grown-up family . While Mr. Jannings is on the screen , as he is most of the time , even the bleary portions of the film are compelling . <P> Moon of Israel . Again the Red Sea makes way for the Israelites. ! This time the miracle is incidental to a story based on Sir Rider Haggard 's novel . This German film includes an episode in which the son of Pharaoh seeks out a slave girl as bride . It manages to be rather dull . <P> Wedding Bills ( Raymond Griffith ) . " He is the worst best man I ever had , " says the groom of Mr. Van Twidder . The trouble is that Mr. Van Twidder has been pressed into too many wedding ceremonies , is bored with everything . No former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obliged to recover letters from a blackmailing woman and to chase a pigeon up the flagpole of a skyscraper in what proved , figuratively and literally , to be the high point of a funny film . <P> The First Auto . When , in 1895 , the automobile started to run the horse out , Hank Armstrong ( Russell Simpson ) found himself hitched to the stable cause , while his son , Bob ( Charles E. Mack* ) , trailed the new-fangled enemy . Only after Barney Oldfield ( who appears in the film ) has roared over a race track at the unprecedented speed of 60 miles per hour , and Sloe Eyes , his last mare , has taken her final earthly hurdle , does the old horse-lover give in to the conquering gas-buggy . By that time his son has grown romantic under the influence of the heroine ( Patsy Ruth Miller ) and returned to the horse tradition , leaving the house as hopelessly divided against itself as before . <P>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
