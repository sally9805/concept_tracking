txt There is a better sentiment regarding oil , following the continued decline of production in California and Mexico . Fields in southern California last week produced 388,000 barrels ? daily , compared with a high mark of 663,000 barrels in August , 1923 . This is a decline of 41% . It represents a loss of 275,000 barrels a day , which is far more than the state was able to ship to the eastern refiners . The average daily shipments of California oil in the last six months of 1923 were 180,000 barrels . Shipments from California are now down to 115,000 barrels . California- now has no surplus of oil production to be shipped to the east , and any shipments being made are coming out of storage Of the wells drilled in Mexico last year 50% were failures , and production of both light and heavy oil shows steady decline . Net result of these two situations is a ? favorable condition respecting the midcontinent and eastern oil companies generally .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
