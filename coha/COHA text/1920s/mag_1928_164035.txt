Before the War , people with hurried , valuable or perishable parcels to ship addressed themselves directly to the American Express Co. , the Adams Express Co. , or Wells , Fargo &; Co . During the War , the Government monopolized railroading and expressing . In 1918 a single new company , the American Railway Express Company , inherited from the Government a monopoly of the express-carrying business of the U. S. The three oldtime companies have valuable stock interests in this temporary express trust , which enormously increases the market value of their own shares . The holdings of Adams Express in American Railway Express stock were estimated last week at $10,904,300 of the total $34,642,000 capital . <P> Last week President William Benson Storey of the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa F Railway Co. , Chairman of the Committee on Uniform Express Contracts of American Railway Executives , announced flatly : " We are going to consider within the next week at a meeting in New York whether to go further with the plan or not . " The " plan " is for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Railway Express Company . Later , President Storey declared , rather to the surprise of railroad executives generally , that he had the approval of railroads carrying 75% of the U. S. express traffic , hence he thought the plan would go through . <P> The list of Chairman Storey 's committeemen is formidable : Brigadier General William Wallace Atterbury for the Pennsylvania Railroad ; Patrick Edward Crowley for the New York Central ; Charles Donnelly for the Northern Pacific ; Laurence Aloysius Downs for the Illinois Central ; Carl Raymond Gray for the Union Pacific ; Edward Jones Pearson for the New York , New Haven &; Hartford ; Bird M. Robinson for the American Short Lines Association . <P> The contract between the American Railway Express and the railroads for hauling express expires in February 1929 . At that time , according to the contract imposed by the Government , the railroads may exercise a legal option to purchase the American Railway Express at cost less depreciation . Suppose , ruminated Wall Street , the new " invisible " owners of the American Railway Express decline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad masters , aided by legal masters , would reply by simply purchasing express wagons , express trucks , renting express offices for the railroads of the U. S. , leaving the American Railway Express with great experience in handling express but with no railroads to haul it . <P> But Chairman Storey spoke amiably last week about measures " for the protection of the express company . " And he also said : " There is plenty of time between now and next February for the railroads to organize their own express business . "
