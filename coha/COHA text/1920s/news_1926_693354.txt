txt Taking issue with the Republican majority of the House Ways and Means Committee , the Chamber of Commerce of the United States declared today in favor of a reduction of the corporation income tax during the present session of Congress , and recommended a tax program which would substantially balance the governmental receipts and expenditures . The prospective Treasury surplus of about $400,000,000 for 1927 , the Chamber held , : would make it safe to reduce the corporation income tax from 13% to not more than 10 per cent . The recommendations in behalf of the Chamber were made by a committee headed by Dr. T. S. Adams . an economist of Yale University The action , it was stated , was in conformity with the attitude taken by the Chamber on the general question of taxation as outlined in a statement made by President O'Leary to President Coolidge. in which the necessity of reducing corporate income taxes and the repeal of the estate tax and certain excise taxes was emphasized . Two Propositions Advocated . The propositions which the Chamber advocates are as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially equal to the annual surplus realizable under the present law . The equitable distribution of the tax burden calls for the application of a large portion of this surplus to the reduction of the corporation income taxes . There should be developed a systematic program of revenues and expenditures for the National Government to the end that these may be substantially balanced . The committee declared that " for the present all payments made by foreign Governments to the United States on account of both interest and principal of their debts should be applied to the retirement of the national public debt . " " Horizontal rebates or reductions in taxes . " the report stated . " while always acceptable to the recipients thereof , do not remove any inequalities which may exist in the system . While practical conditions may not at present permit an immediate general revision of the revenue law , no such general revision will be necessary to bring into more equitable relation with other taxes the levy which is now most out of line  --  namely , the corporate income tax  --  since this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate in the existing statute . Heavy Corporation Payments. , " This calendar year at the rate of 13 per cent . on net profits it is estimated that the corpora ' oils will pay to the National Government about $1,200 , - 000,000 in income taxes . The estimated ' surplus for the fiscal year is sufficient to permit of an ' immediate reduction to 10 per cent . Next year , if this particular provision of the revenue act is not changed , corporations must pay at the rate of 13% per cent . on income , thus further increasing the present burden of taxation an paying into the Treasury still larger sums which are not necessary fo meet the current expenses of government . " At the present time the majority of those paying individual income taxes pay at the minimum rate of 11/2 per cent. , yet these numerous taxpayers are assessed at the rate of 13 per cent . on all income received from corporations in the form of dividends . " In 1924 , the dividends reported by individual payers saying on $10.000 or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required profits of S1.057,000.000 , on which 5132,000,000 in corporation taxes were paid . The maximum tax on the same profits had they been taxed to the same individuals would not have exceeded $187 , - 000,000 , or $114,000,000 ' ess than the corporations paid . " The characteristic American method of doing business is by means of corporate organization . Since the corporations must earn and provide a large proportion of individual income upon which the personal income tax is based , the proper adjustment of the corporation tax is of essential importance . It is manifest that a burdensome levy on the sources of the production must inevitably discourage enterprise and business expansion and result in the curtailment of earnings . " Democrats Move Against Gag Mile . Steps were taken today by the Democratic organization of the House to prevent the adoption of gag rules ton throttle the Garner tax proposal if a Majority of the members sign the peti- tion to discharge the Committee on Ways and Means from further consideration of the measure . A resolution was introduced by Representative Garrett , the minority leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate on the Garner bill if the House takes it fro= the Ways and Means Committee . Mr. Garrett wants to avoid a possible filibuster should he and Mr. Garner succeed in getting the Garner bill before the House . Without the proposed rule , he contends , the Republican leaders would be able to prevent a vote before March 4 . The Garrett resolution will not be pressed unless the petition to discharge is signed by the necessary 218 members to give it effect . The Democratic leaders are assured that all their party ' men will sign . They need the signatures of thirty-six Republicans . If they do not get them the Garner bill will stay in committee .
