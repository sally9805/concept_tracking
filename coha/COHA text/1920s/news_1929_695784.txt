txt It has happened often in our history-and more often in the longer history of England  --  that charitable bequests made with the best intentions , and seemingly with the greatest wisdom , come to share the mortality of the givers . When the ob= jects no longer existed what was given also perished , as it could be turned to no other purpose . Two of the bequests of one of the Wisest of Americans , BENJAMIN FRANKLIN , . are often cited . Conditions ' which even his remarkable mind , with its extraordinary range and vision , could not have anticipated nullified his generous provision for " indentured " apprentices and of a watersupply for his own city . Another bequest in point is that of a St. Louis philanthropist who left a fund for those who traveled in covered wagons , never dreaming that the automobile and the airplane would make covered wagons so obsolete as to be objects of curiosity in pictures .

No innovation of time , " " the greatest innovator , " can so surprise gifts in the hands of sueceexling wisdoms as to make them inutile . Life is built on death by such an agency as the Community Trust which " on change duration founds . " The placing of $2,500,000 by the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Board in the Equitable Trust Company as trustee for the New York Community Trust is the highest recognition which this new institution has received . The Trust Company Division of the American Bankers Association formally endorsed this movement a few months ago , saying that the Community Trust organizations " had made available for the " administration of trust funds for " charitable purposes a more effec " tive procedure than any heretofore " devised .

" The other feature is that after ten years a certain amount of the principal ( not more than $125,000 ) may be spent yearly if it is believed that the purposes of the fund will in this way be best accomplished . There is , thus , this one possible limitation to a life .
