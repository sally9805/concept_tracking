When the electric industry of the U. S. first got under way , the problem of financing its customers at once arose . The General Electric Co. consequently organized the Electric Bond &; Share Co. as a subsidiary , to supervise electrical engineering construction projects and to obtain capital for them . In enterprises so financed , purchases of electrical equipment were confined to the General Electric as a seller . The Electric Bond &; Share Co. came to control directly or indirectly over 100 electric power , street railway and gas companies , with a combined capital of about $650,000,000 and serving a population of over 7,000,000 people . <P> This union between General Electric as a seller and so many operating service companies as buyers , effected through the Electric Bond &; Share Co. , has long been criticized on the grounds of monopoly . While jealousy of rival producing companies and political claptrap have played a large part in such criticism , nevertheless there has been present something of truth and justification . <P> The General Electric officials , headed by Chairman Owen D. Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns and segregate Electric Bond &; Share . This will be done by organizing a new company with 1,802,870 shares to take over the latter 's business and receive General Electric 's holdings in its subsidiary . To General Electric stockholders of record Jan. 15 , 1925 , the shares of this new company will be distributed as a stock dividend . <P> The action was taken entirely on the volition of the General Electric Co . Nevertheless , various political groups , particularly the Federal Trade Commission , will probably hasten to " claim credit ' ? for dissolving the " Electrical Trust . "
