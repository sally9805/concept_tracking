Men burning leaves or breaking the ground on little farms in Jersey , on fields beside rutted lanes in Delaware where few travelers come , heard , one cool morning last week , a humming and a drumming in the sky , looked up , saw over their heads a great silver shape that flew south as the birds were flying , as the grey geese , the sleek ducks that leave their marshy beds and beat away with the frost at their backs . The Shenandoah it was , which had on that cool morning left its hangar at Lakehurst to start on the longest flight ever attempted by an airship . <P> On it went . Cities , under the arrowy path of its going , dropped behind like milestones-Wilmington , Baltimore , Washington ; then colored country again , woods and fields , the brave and opulent lands of proud Virginia .

So was ended the first lap of the journey . The time was 34 hours . The distance was approximately 1,400 miles . <P> When it took the air next morning , its arrogant nose was pointed at the Rockies . The morning 's flying was serene enough , over Texas to Tucson and Cochise , Ariz. ; but in the late afternoon the mountains were reached , over which a wind was whistling jauntily . High in air climbed the dirigible , entering the Dragoon Pass ; there was a great peak just as high that loomed out of the dusk , a black and ominous spike such as affrights the keels of lowlier boats , hard on the starboard side .

Then the little light of a freight train that labored along far below pointed out the way , which lay directly along the route of the Texas Pacific R. R. After midnight , the ship - that haughty ship that almost stubbed its toe on a mountain peak-reached San Diego and the Pacific .
