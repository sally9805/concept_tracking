James Joseph Tunney , world 's heavyweight champion , will meet Thomas Heeney , challenger , in a 15-round boxing match at the Yankee Stadium , the Bronx , N. Y. , on the evening of July 26 , under the auspices of George L. Rickard . <P> That means : <P> The Great Intellectual , the boy that Kid Shakespeare knocked for a row of midnight oilcans , will exchange bopps on the beak with the New Zealand Menace , the Plumber 's Son , the Horseshoe Carpenter . They will attempt to put the snooze on each other , while the Grand Vizier of the Golden Gate takes in slightly more or slightly less than one million smackers . <P> Last week , Tunney paused in his training at Speculator , N. Y. , to say that he expects to administer a knock-out to Heeney . Word flew , as it often does , to Heeney at Rumson Farm Kennels in Fairhaven , N. J. The Irishman from New Zealand snorted : " Well , blime me if that does n't take the royal cake for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place Tunney knocks out anybody . Why , he could n't stop Dempsey when the old Manassa <P> Mauler was ready for the scrap ' cap , and ' e wo n't cup up my eyes , either . In all the time I 've been fighting only one man did that , and ' e did by butting . . . . I 've been reading where Tunney is supposed to be the Woodrow Wilson of boxing . If that 's so , I must be the Theodore Roosevelt , because they say I 'm rough and I 'm always ready . " <P> Good though the Tunney-Heeney exchange of pleasantries was , people debated whether Promoter Rickard would get another million-dollar gate . Said Tunney : " Rickard is a nice fellow and a capable man , but I think sometimes he has gone million-dollar daffy . ... I think he could do something for the business if he would reduce prices and purses . " <P> Heeney is 29 years old , expects to weigh 200 pounds for the fight . Details of training make him sulky ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is happy when dressed up in quietly tailored clothes and when friends are spoofing him . He delights in boasting about his healthy tribe back in New Zealand-his mother who can do a full day 's milking at 80 , his sister who has " possibly 20 children . " He is a hard man to knockout , but his defense is clumsy . If he becomes champion , he will have a good time and people will think him something of a clown .
