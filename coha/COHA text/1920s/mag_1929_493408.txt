Abolish the Battleship ! The Opportunity Which Confronts the London Naval Conference , and the Serious Result If It Is Not Grasped THE Naval Conference approaches , irradi ? ated by the afterglow of the Anglo-Ameri ? can honeymoon . One notices on the Eng ? lish side of the Atlantic a tendency to regard it as a mere ratification of those happy conversations in Washington . Have we not agreed , once and for all , upon parity ? Is not the possibility of war be ? tween the English-speaking peoples eliminated , even from the professional calculations of the admirals ? The details , indeed , await the final technical defini ? tion , but even these , we are assured , are settled within a margin of 30,000 tons . Public opinion , with this view of the outlook before it , is compla ? cent and satisfied , enormously content at the happy turn in the relations of London and Washington , and barely aware that anything further is at stake . It may well be content with the political out ? come of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , the two democracies discovered each other . But there will be other issues at the Lon ? don Conference . Will there come out of it any substantial reduction of armaments ; and in what shape will it leave our own relations with our Euro ? pean neighbors ? The latter question may seem to concern English ? men more closely than Americans , but on a close view this comforting anticipation may disappear . One must realize at the outset that France will enter this Conference in a mood of unusual dis ? quiet and irritation . She was disturbed in all her calculations when she realized that the Labor gov ? ernment had actually put an end to the Entente Cordiale . That seemed to her so nearly incredible that she expected the fall of this iniquitous admin ? istration from one hour to another . The inevi ? table shock of this discovery was rendered unneces ? sarily bitter by Mr. Snowden 's bad manners at the Hague Conference . But mere ignorance has ag ? gravated , and still aggravates , our uneasy relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble to ad ? just themselves to a new situation which they sup ? pose to be temporary . If they realized that Labor has probably four , and conceivably eight , years of office before it , they might make the effort of adap ? tation which , at present , seems to them superfluous . In this mood of alarm at their own isolation , they chose to interpret Mr. MacDonald 's visit as a sign that London had substituted an Anglo-American quasi-alliance for the Entente Cordiale . It followed that the Anglo-American proposals to limit cruisers and abolish submarines , while leav ? ing the battle fleets intact , struck the French as a plan to stabilize our superiority at sea in a more crushing form than ever before . France possesses no modern battleships , and has allowed sixteen years to pass without attempting to build them . She faced our twenty monsters , trusting in the first place to the link of the Entente , secondly , to the ef ? ficiency of her own submarines , and , thirdly , to the check of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask her to abolish submarines , while , as she sees the position , American and British power are in a new and disturbing relation of intimacy . If this does not mean ( as her alarmists spluttered ) that the two fleets will act together , at least , it may , mean that the British Admiralty is free to operate as it pleases in the Old World , and can concentrate most of its strength in European waters . That sig .. nifies , in the jargon of our hemisphere which Ameri ? can and British Liberals regard as obsolete , a shift ? ing of the balance of power to the disadvantage of France . We are impatient , both of us , at this mode of thought , but unless we can divine what is passing in the minds of the French , and contrive in some way to reassure them , the Conference may end in dis. , appointment . For no Frenchman , if he sees the balance of power shifting against him , will consent to disarm . He would have disarmed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain in 1919 in guaranteeing the Eastern frontier . He would have done it , if the Geneva Protocol had been ratified , for it would have buttressed the Euro ? pean status quo and the Versailles settlement by a tight and reliable system of military sanctions . But to disarm when he seems to stand more perilously alone than at any moment since 1904 ? that would be gross imprudence . One fears , then , that all the ingenuity of the French will be used ? with the brilliant and adapta ? ble M. Briand responsible to a moderate majority and a Conservative Premier ? to frustrate disarma ? ment . They would like to gain time by delaying the meeting of the Conference . They may try to give to all its debates a hypothetical and contingent character , by plying the argument that disarma ? ment is no mere naval question . One defends one ? self as best one may on land , at sea and in the air . How can one isolate any one of these fields of de . fense ? And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they can not consent to ' diminish their power at sea , until they know . December 25 , 1929 THE NEW whether the subsequent Conference at Geneva will leave it relatively intact on land and in the air . To the less subtle Anglo-Saxon mind , this seems like a deliberate complication of the issues , devised to frustrate any clear-cut decision . Our method , when we mean business , is to isolate questions , even at the expense of logic . In this instance . our instinct is probably sound . If the Naval Conference achieves little , then the French will argue that since we have not disarmed at sea , neither will she disarm on land . Alternatively , it is probable that if she knew in advance that her land armaments were safe , she might consent to drastic reductions at sea . We may feel , such is our new confidence in each other , that Anglo-American friendship would sur ? vive the failure of this Conference . We might both have to build ships which ought to be superfluous , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but two very unpleasant consequences would follow . In the first place , no disarmament whatever would result , and the world would smile cynically at the Pact of Paris , which had failed , while renouncing war , to make ships or guns less necessary than be ? fore . In the second place , the French , by isolating themselves morally , would compel America and Great Britain to act together with precisely that ex ? clusive intimacy which both of us disavow . The French , in other words , by maladroit opposition to an Anglo-American quasi-alliance which does not exist , may come near to creating it . That is the last thing we desire , but it may come about , if this Conference fails . Friendships , helpful , intimate , but not exclusive , are possible in a disarmed world . In a world which refuses to disarm , a working friendship can hardly fail to become an alliance . The moral is clear . One can insure the success of this Conference only by removing the suspicions which the French entertain . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by a demonstration that we are indif ? ferent to power . It is not enough to arrange parity and to limit building . This Conference can dissipate the Old World reasoning about the bal ? ance of power only by a great renunciation of power itself . In plain words it must be by a bold reduction of naval armaments that we prepare the new era in which war is outlawed . Only by bring ? ing France herself cordially and sincerely into this movement , can we obviate the danger that our own intimacy will drift towards an exclusive alliance . Liberal opinion in America is , perhaps , more sharply conscious than opinion of the same shade in England that the Washington conversations have achieved little for disarmament . Parity , in ? deed , on the scale which British admirals have laid down , might well mean that there will be more cruisers in the world after the Conference than there were before it . Here the responsibility lies with us . But no final ' decision , one gathers , has yet been taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctance to content itself with twelve 10,000-ton cruisers , since that total would involve the scrapping of three vessels not yet completed , on which much good money has been spent . It remains to be seen whether economy and policy will prevail over this intelligible sentiment . But by far the greater opportunity for reduction is presented by capital ships . It is certain that even the naval die-hards will consent to postpone the re ? placement of battleships for five years , and to lower the maximum tonnage of each ship . So much was in Mr. Baldwin 's program . But is this to be all ? Do we really contemplate that seven years after the renunciation of war , we shall each begin spending our national resources at the rate of forty million dollars apiece , on fifteen of these ships , which have no conceivable use , save to impose on others the will of a wealthy people by force ? Cruisers have their uses even in peace , for purposes of police . Battleships exist only to sink other battleships . British naval thinkers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rela ? tive , when this maxim is applied to cruisers . The number of these vessels destined to protect our trade routes , they say , should stand in some arith ? metical ratio to the mileage which they must patrol ; there is , therefore , some absolute minimum of safety . But no such reasoning applies to battle ? ships . Here all is relative ? numbers , tonnage and armaments . Each of us is obliged to build and maintain them only because others keep up the fashion . The " others " are growing conspicuously fewer . France and Italy will never build a battle ? ship again . Three powers , only , combine to inflict this charge upon each other . It is no solution to postpone replacement . In ? deed , to say , in cold blood , that we will start build ? ing these leviathans five years hence is rather worse than to do it now . It implies that peace will have made no progress in five years . To scale down the displacement of each ship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25,000 tons , is mani ? festly a weak compromise between the radical younger school which doubts the combatant value of the battleship when faced by hydroplanes and submarines , and the conservatives who can not for ? get that great ships mean prestige , to say nothing of contracts and careers . It is not even certain that these slightly smaller ships would be cheaper , for they would have to carry thicker and costlier deck armor against attacks from the air . The trend , then , alike of the political and of the technical argument , carries us to the bold con ? clusion that the battleship ought to be abolished . By this one means , either a ruthless and simul ? taneous scrapping of every ship over 10,000 tons , or else an agreement ( adjusted equitably among the three fleets ) not to replace existing ships when their normal term of life expires . The former Would be incomparably the more satisfactory solu ? tion , for it would be difficult to exaggerate its value as a proof that we were all sincere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader may inquire whether this proposal is merely the cloistered wis ? dom which Liberals exchange in their impotent seclusion , or is a policy which any government dare propose . The answer is plain and direct . This policy will be proposed at the . Five-Power Conference . The question is rather : will the British and American governments dare to reject it ? For it is the inten ? tion of France to propose it , and one can hear in advance the eloquence of M. Briand 's oration . It will be , of course , her answer to the Anglo-Ameri ? can suggestion for the abandonment of submarines . It will cost France nothing , and it will make an ef ? fective retort . Doubtless , M. Briand expects us to reject it . He will then keep his submarines with a clear conscience , and the Conference will end in stalemate . But can America , after Mr. Hoover 's offer to go " as low as others will go , " reject it ? And can Great Britain refuse it , if America ac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only such a measure of courage as is within the compass of the practical politician , to adopt this radical policy , Years of expert skepticism as to the utility of the battleship have prepared public opinion for it , and even The London Times consents to print the able articles of Admiral Richmond , in which he argues that we require no warships over 10,000 tons . This immense advance towards a disarmed world is within our reach . If we would be wise , let us for once affect to be simple . The proposal may be nothing but a tactical maneuver . Let us be blind to its subtlety , and welcome it in all its literalness . London . H. N. BRAILSFORD . Farm Relief or Bank Relief ? I KNOW a lot of tough-minded farmers and orchardists out in California , and they are ask ? ing pregnant questions about federal farm re ? lief . Granted that they have been hornswoggled and frustrated so often that they would ask ques ? tions about any gift horse , still in this case their questions seem pertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover 's Farm Board , with $500 , ? 000,000 to loan as it sees fit , has interpreted the new Farm Relief Act in a certain way , and by that interpretation has undertaken to stimulate , require and even demand the existence of cooperatives , tech ? nically grower-owned , for the marketing of crops . Chairman Legge says : " The funds entrusted to the care of the Board will be administered for the pur ? pose of carrying out its program , of which the central thought will be the strengthening of the cooperative movement . " The Board , under him , is manned with coOperative veterans . You belong to a coOperative of which this Board approves , or you get none of the federal farm-aid money , with its easy terms of interest and repayment . Well and good . It strikes a splendid note . We all are sold on the proposition that a thorough ? going cooperative structure would be the redemp ? tion of agriculture . What about the method ? A man of long experience in cooperative organization who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine local coOperative , said to me of the Farm Board 's policy , before a single loan had been made : " That 's a hell of a way to upbuild cooperation 1 What we shall get will be the coOperative shape , not the substance . Cooperation bribed into the farmer from above wo n't last . In the end , this will set back the American coOperative movement another twenty years . " Was he right ? . Another veteran in progressive agricultural causes explained : " What people fail to see is that there are true and there are false cooperatives . The false ones are the worst enemies of the true . My guess is that the false cooperatives will have first call on the Farm Board 's money , and the true ones will continue to struggle along by themselves . Why ? Because the false ones will have all the banking influence . This $500,000,000 of easy-term federal money is the banks ' best chance to get rid of bad debts , or , con ? versely , to build up their chosen - friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bank relief . " Many readers will regard these opinions as ex , treme . However , let us consider one of the first of the great loans advanced by the Farm Board . The very first , as will be recalled , was $300,000 advanced to fight the fruit fly in Florida . The second , to which I refer , was a loan , or series of loans , totaling nearly $12,000,000 , to the grape in ? industry of California . It began one week-end , with the announcement that the Farm Board , together with three banks , had advanced $9,000,000 to the Sun-Maid Raisin Association . Now , the grape in ? industry , hit hard by federal prohibition , needs federal help . Were there , then , parades of re , joicing farmers all up and down the grape belt ? There were not . What happened was that the growers in several towns immediately held meetings of protest . In two raisin centers , they actually organized and pledged defense funds to be used if lawsuits should arise from their refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of raisin-grape growers published paid advertisements in the news . papers , declaring that its tonnage would not under the circumstances be sold to Sun-Maid . The first act of farm relief had brought a farmers ' strikel
