" It seems strange to me that ... I should suddenly become one of the idols of the English public merely by writing one short play . Congratulations are pouring in upon me now , but they find me only a very weak old man , barely able to stand . " <P> The twinkling-eyed , cherubic-countenanced old Irishman who grumbled thus , last week , is George Moore , 75 , litterateur , epicure , and naughty-man-of-letters . Few smart , well-read folk do not know his Confessions of a Young Man ; his great trilogy Ave , Salve , Vale ; and his more recent elusively rich and moving Heloise and Abelard ( 1921 ) . The trouble with these works is , however , that they appeal merely to a small group , select and perhaps elect . Not until last week did George Moore know the crude , earthy , tangible joy of having written a play which London proceeded to applaud , not merely from the lordly stalls but from the common , vociferating gallery . <P> The play is The Making of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . He seemed diverted by a drama which unfolds upon the stage the theory that that erudite Elizabethan , Francis Bacon ( Baron Verulam , Viscount St. Albans ) , was the real author of plays now attributed to William Shakespeare . The stalls were atwitter between the acts , as nice points of Baconiana and Shakespeariana were weighed . But while the curtain was up the gallery roared approval of a mannish , imperious Queen Elizabeth and of a Will Shakespeare who seemed but a lout of an actor and most timid and unwilling to lend his name to the immortal works of lordly Francis Bacon . <P> On the morning following the premiere almost every dramatic critic in London said nice things about aged George Moore 's play , called it " brilliant , " " shrewdly humorous , " " enriched with prose of unusual beauty . " <P> Friends clipped the reviews , carried them to a nursing home where lay Dramatist Moore , and piled the printed praise upon his lap . Dazed at first , he murmured , " My cup of bliss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish spirits to mount until he not only boasted of becoming " an idol of the English public " but added blatantly : <P> " I came to England 40 years ago like a troubadour , to revolutionize English letters . I have been boycotted and spurned . I say now that this generation is the most sterile of any there has been in the way of literature . Not one of my living contemporaries is worth talking about . . . . Conrad 's work will be dead in a year . Anyone could write the stuff he wrote about barges floating in green-blue hazes . . . . Thomas Hardy could n't write two lines of correct English and . . . had no insight into human nature . " <P> Having vented this spleen George Moore lapsed back into his easy chair , grew pensive , and finally reconsidered . Said he , as the intoxication of his play 's success wore off , " Of course what I said did not apply to admittedly outstanding writers of today . . . Kipling for instance .
