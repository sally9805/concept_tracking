THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES-AN INTERPRETATION OF ITS FOUNDATION , METHODS AND ACHIEVEMENTS-Charles Evans Hughes-Columbia University Press ( $2.50 ) . <P> THE BUSINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT-A STUDY IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM-Felix Frankfurter and James M. Landis-Macmillan ( $5.00 ) . <P> The History . It was in 1775 , says Mr. Hughes , that Washington addressed the Continental Congress : " Should not a court be established by authority of Congress to take cognizance of prizes made by the Continental vessels ? " The prize vessels got their court , and were forgotten . But the federal court has persisted for a century and a half , and culminates in the present Supreme Court which is designed to maintain the necessary balance 1 ) between State and Nation ; 2 ) between individual rights as guaranteed by the constitution and social interest as expressed in legislation . <P> Authors Frankfurter and Landis analyze the political , social and economic forces that have produced changes in the federal judicial system . With the Civil War , the triumph of nationalism over " states ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified and expanded their structure . Tremendous increase in industry so flooded their dockets that a separate court was created for customs appeals , and another for regulation of railways and other great national utilities . Involved in politics , this latter ( a Commerce Court not to be confused with the Interstate Commerce Commission ) was short-lived . <P> With all their disadvantages , the old panaceas for more courts , more Supreme Court justices , divisional sittings , have been revived since the Great War . Failing a Lord Chancellor ( equivalent to a Ministry of Justice ) , leadership for reform is unofficial , and the less effective . Constant reform , however , is inevitable : " Law and courts are instruments of adjustment . " <P> The Significance . It has been said that the nine men on the Supreme Court at Washington are the real rulers of this country . Be that as it may , their position is such that the alert U. S. citizen should know the extent of their power . Though both the present volumes are concerned with restricting the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its jurisdiction , but rather the amount of its work , so that the Court may be increasingly powerful . Hughes emphasizes the Court 's deliberate determination to confine itself to its judicial task ( maintaining of course its authority as interpreter of the Constitution ) ; Frankfurter and Landis , on the other hand , demonstrate the Supreme Justices ' increasing importance as statesmen and economists . Of the two volumes , the former Justice 's is the more readable , packed as it is with lucid case illustration , and the virtuosity of his own rich experience . <P> The Authors .

Another of his distinguished titles is " Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple " ( London ) .
