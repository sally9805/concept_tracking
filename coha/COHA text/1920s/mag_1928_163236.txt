The annual winter unemployment problems of agrarian Argentina were made more than usually acute , last week , by two strikes . The strike among longshoremen at the port-city of Rosario caused sympathetic strikes to break out at Buenos Aires and Sante Fe where three rioting strikers were killed . Meanwhile President Marcelo de Alvear was attempting without apparent success to prevent the calling of a threatened general strike of all railway and allied workers . <P> President-Elect Dr. Hipolito Irigoyen ( TIME , May 21 ) increased the general discontent by announcing that after his inauguration , next October , he will put into effect a " middle-age pension " law designed to permit toilers to retire at the approximate age of 45 . This Utopian piece of legislation has actually been on the statute books since the last Presidency of Dr. Irigoyen ( 1916-22 ) but has never come into effect , due to the opposition of President de Alvear.
