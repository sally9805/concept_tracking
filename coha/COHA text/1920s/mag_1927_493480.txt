Mass Meeting THE bell in the tower of Old East Hall is tolling I a quick , high note of alarm . The air is cold , sharp , quick with frost . Out of the darkness comes the swift hush-hush of many feet hurrying through fallen leaves . The parade is forming at the cannon . Already several hundred have collected . Kerosene torches , stuck in the ground around the cannon , breathe orange flames up into the darkness , and copper the elms and the ivy-covered walls of Standish and Malone . The blank windows waver red and silver in the light . The faces of the gathering crowd are white and mask-like . The bass-drummer pounds his drum steadily , a booming monotone . High overhead in the darkness , the bell rings and rings . The cheer-leaders , in black sweaters and white flannel trousers , run to and fro , forming the stragglers into 3 column . " Line up ! Line up ! This way I Freshmen at the d The head cheer-leader , standing a little to one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : December 7 , 1927 . THE NEW " Let 's go ! " The cheer-leaders bawl in unison t " One long roar ! One long roar ! Are you ready ? Hi-i-ip , Hi-i-ip -- The long cheer crashes out raggedly , thinning quickly into the air . " Terrible ! " yells the head cheer-leader . " Come on , now ! Let 's hear you ! " Once again . Louder this time . The late arrivals are running now . The long irregular line numbers near a thousand . With a smash of cymbals and a double boom-boom from the drum , the band strikes up the marching song . The parade moves off . Four abreast , headed by the band and the torch-bearers , the parade winds through the campus , picking up stragglers as it goes . Whenever they pass a lighted window , the crowd.set up a yell , " Everybody out ! Mass meeting ! Everybody out ! " The ' light always goes out with suddenness . By the time they swing into College Street , nearly two thousand undergraduates are marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalks and stare . Usually their stare is vaguely hostile , but tonight they look proudly at these marching warriors . Not a shop on College Street , including the Bank , but has its placard in the window , " BEAT PAYNE I " The town has a lot of money on the game . Now the paraders turn off College Street into the cam-Pus again , and storm into Hercules Hall , scramble and clatter into the bare auditorium , shove into the banging seats . The head cheer-leader is waiting on the platform . While the tail-end of the rear-guard is still jammed in the door-Way , his megaphoned yell rings dizzily around the gal ? leries , " One long roar ! And make it a good one ! " On a pontifical throne behind the cheer-leader sits the President of the college , dignified , inconspicuous . When the team file on to the platform , and take their seats in a semi-circle behind ' him , he is lost in the savage uproar . ' But the cheer-leader has not forgotten him . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " One long roar for the President ! " The cheer booms up , solid and solemn . He is their high Priest . He will bless the hosts and send them out to the battle . He stands there , in the dignity of his office and his sixty years , wipes his eye-glasses , clears his throat . His eye looks calmly , proudly , about the packed auditorium . " Men of Alamayter , " he begins . " This is a momentous occasion ? " On Saturday they will play Payne , their . ancient foe . He hopes they will quit themselves like men . Re is sure they will . He himself , unfortunately , will not be able to be in the cheering section in person , but they may be sure that he will be " rooting earnestly " for Alamayter . He is usually chary of making predictions , but on this occasion he can not forbear . If the spirit of the undergraduate body is any indication , we will beat Payne . And he believes that we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-clapping . The ? resident bows , smiles at the team , makes a dignified exit through the wings , pursued by one more long roar . Now the song-leader takes charge . " Fellows , Payne 's going to have a damn sight bigger cheering section than we have . I want you fellows to show me tonight that you can drown ' em out . Make it loud , you freshmen ! Let 's got " Two thousand voices thunder in unison the opening bar of the college marching song . But the song-leader will have none of it . He leaps up and down frantically , wav ? ing his arms disgustedly . " Awful ! " yells the song-leader . " Terrible ! Make a little noisel Come on now ? let 's hear you ! " In the gallery where the freshmen and sophomores sit jammed together , a sophomore leans forward and hisses to the freshman in front of him : " Put some guts into it , freshman ! If you can speak above a whisper when this is over , give you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the freshman 's ears . On the next chorus , the veins in his neck stand out rigid , and his cracking voice can be heard even above the bellowing around him . But the sophomore has tasted blood . Between songs and cheers , he peers around him with accusing eyes , and remarks loudly to his neighbors that there 's only one worse traitor than the man who stays away from a mass meeting , and that 's the man who comes and does n't yell his heart out . One by one the members of the team stalk forward an the platform to " say a few words . " Eddy Moriarity , the line-plunging back , with a build like Neanderthal man . Mooch Kelly , all-American tackle . A mean pair of hands . Runt Spivis , the quarterback ; the hardest man on the team to hurt . Sport Richards , the Adonis of the campus . All are solemn , determined , and say earnestly what the rest have said . " Fellows , we 're going to beat Payne . " Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for Alamayter , to give his all . All will give their all . And now a momentary hush . The cheer-leader , his voice already hoarse , announces the climax of the rally . The Coach ! Bill Kilgore , all-American end in ' 07 . A forceful speaker . Ask the team . He will say a few words to us . Jehovah , Lord God of battles ! Bill Kilgore , coach of the Alamayter team , comes forward . He has put on some weight since 1907 . But see his jaw . And that eye of a tiger . He has a brow like Alexander 's . " Men ! " he barks . There is not a sound in the auditorium . The freshmen hold their breath . " Men ! We 're going up to play Payne on Saturday . We 're going up to play Payne , and we 're not going in any light-hearted spirit . Na We 're going up against one of the best teams Payne ever had ! And we 're going to win ! If ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You - ? heard what they said . And you can take it from me , they 'll do what they say ! They 'll be right in there , fighting every minute of that game , and giving the best they 've got to give . If I see one of those men miss a tackle ? out he comes ; I do n't care if it 's the captain himself ! They 'll ' play hard and fight hard as long as they can stand up ? and longer if they have to ! There 'll be no substitutions for any man unless he breaks a leg ! But they ca n't do everything . It 's up to you fellows here to see that they get the kind of fighting support they deserve . When this team comes out on the field next Saturday before the game , I want to hear a yell from you that 'll make that stadium rock ! Terrific cheers . Better than that ! And it is n't only the noise you make : it 's the spirit you put into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game on Saturday ? Spirit ! the winning spirit/ The fighting spirit ! The team 's got it ? have you ? Roars of " Yes ! " Boys , I 've known this football business for some little time . now , and let me tell you something . The people that think football is a game ? are crazy . Football is n't a game ; it 's a battle . It 's a war . And we 're in it to win/ What use do you think a good loser is in a war ? We do n't want good losers . We have no use for ' em . What we want is a football team that will win ! Savage applause . This team will have to play better and fight harder than they know how , to beat Payne . I believe they 'll do it . But they ca n't do it unless you up there in the cheering section are right in there behind them , fighting every inch of the way ! When one of our backs hits the line , hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the ball , knock that Payne line back ! Shove till you crack the cement ! Yell till you 've lost your voices ? and then go on yelling ! I know there 's not a man of you that does n't wish he could be down on that field on Saturday , helping Alamayter beat Payne . I know you wish you could do something to help this team win . Well , you ca n't play with them , but here 's something you can do . When you get up to Payne Saturday , how are you going to act ? Are you going to slink around the streets as if you did n't belong ? As if you were apologizing for being an Alamayter man ? Or are you going to walk those streets as if you owned the town ? Men , here 's what you can do to show the team you 're with ' em ! When you 're up in Payne Saturday , and you see some Payne men coming along the sidewalk , shove ' em off ! " Terrific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the platform , rasps through his megaphone : " One long roar for Alamayter ! One long roar ! Come on now ! " Once more the windows shudder as two thousand voices crash in fierce unison against them . The solid waves of sound leap back harshly , stunningly , from the walls . Voices break in this last effort , and there is a high overtone of desperation , animal , savage . It is enough . Even the cheer-leader is satisfied . He claps his hands , and screams , voicelessly , but his gesture is pleased . He leaps down from the platform , and the song-leader takes his place . Now there is a solemn hush , and a furtive clearing of racked throats . The song-leader raises his hand . Everybody up ! It is the college hymn . Huskily at first , and softly , the chant rises . Doxology of a religious war . The team are singing , too . Who is the happy warrior ? Only look . This is an army with banners . The echoes die . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straining into overcoats . They struggle down the aisles . Here and there one slaps a friend on the back , and one or two fall again into the slouch of the civilian under ? graduate , But the spell of this dedication is still strong . For the most part they go out in a dazed quiet , staring aim ? lessly around , or talking to each other in hoarse under-stones . As the slow mob pours out of Hercules Hall , and spreads in divergent eddies over the moonlit campus , the moon itself , huge and red , hangs , baleful , over the horizon . Joe Falsington , the college atheist , coming down the steps with two friends , points to it , shrinking shiveringly deeper into his overcoat . " A portent ! " he croaks . " Woe to the vanquished ! "
