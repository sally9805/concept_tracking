THE adventure began on the night before we were to fly . It took on the color of reality when at dinner on the veranda of the Pension Inglesa in Barranquilla a man ? a barefoot native ? came and stood quietly beside our table . " The automobile from the hydro-anion , " he said , " will call for you at a quarter to five in the morning . " He spoke as calmly of a hydroplane as though he had said , " To-morrow , Senor , at a quarter of five the mules will be at the door . " After dinner we sat in a swinging scat under the trees on the grounds of the Pension . In silence we blew rings of smoke . I could not talk , for to-morrow I was to fly ! Sitting there in the soft night with a , cool breeze rustling in the palm trees , my mind went back to two years ago when , on our way to Ecuador , a fellow passenger had told us of the hydroplane service just then being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that famous river , from the coast into the heart of the Colombian Andes , became at once my great desire . That my first flight should follow the course of that particular river captured my imagination . I had long wanted to know the Magdalena , as I knew the Yangtse , the Irrawaddy , the Guayas , the Essequibo , and the Mujong ; for I love the drifting life of great rivers . Now I should know the Magdalena . I should not only be borne along by its swift current , but I should follow its course from the air . And this would happen in a country most of which can still be traversed only by canoe , mule-back , and ox-cart ! I had put away the glittering idea of this flight in the most important pigeonhole of my mind . Then two years later , with my Ecuador hook finished , the alluring idea had passed slowly through the stages of possibility and probability and , at last , into certainty . But all this time my dream had been only of splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might play in the travel book of the future . And , blowing wreaths of smoke in the darkness on the night before our flight ; I remained in that simple kingdom of adventure . This hushed anticipation was followed by an hour of feverish packing , for we made the disquieting discovery that our bags weighed seventeen pounds more than we had estimated . In Colombia one flies by weight , and not only is there a high charge for excess , but beyond a certain weight the planes Copyright , 1924 , by Harper Brothers . All rights rosorved. will not rise from the water . The amount of luggage is , therefore , both financially and physically limited . As one proceeds inland the atmospheric conditions make this problem of rising increasingly difficult . The Scadta , Company ? which being interpreted is the Soeiedad ColomboAlemana de Tralisportes A ? reos ? had warned us that our luggage must be reduced to the fewest possible pounds . Thus , at the last moment , we frantically eliminated all luxuries and some necessities . Even our linen dust coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An umbrella and overshoes were discarded . Medicines were thrown overboard . When finally the trunks which were to be left behind were strapped and locked , we once more went over the contents of our two handbags to see that nothing remained which could be east away . For the dozenth time inspected my fiying , - Tarments which I had laid out with anxious care . And at last I crept in under my mosquito netting , to lie long awake , staring up into its roof , too vibrant with the sense of something wonderful about to he , to sleep . In that expectant vigil I realized the zest which flying contributes to the lure of travel and , therefore , to the books in which wanderings are crystallized . I must have slept briefly , for before the porter ? came knocking at the door I was again awake . I went out on the balcony . The royal palm in front of the house stood ghostly green in the flare of an electric light . It stood quite still in the breathless cairn which follows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hushed on that morning of anticipation . I have since wondered how that could have been ; for we were later to stay in Barranquilia. at this same pension and to he waked daily by a crowing as though all the roosters in the world held a convention at which all the braying donkeys were making speeches . But on this particular morning there seemed a tense stillness as I hurried into those garments which I had laid out the night before with as meticulous care , as though their arranging were to be my last earthly act . At half-past four the table boy brought in the breakfast tray . The electric lights had gone out now and the palm was very dark , a black palm in the dim timid light of dawn . The table boy has been generous . After oranges 4nd papaya , toast and jam , boiled eggs and coffee , there remained two bananas .. . It would he nice to take them with us , for we did not know whether there would be any stop for lunch . But ? the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us had the brilliant idea of eating them then and there . But the other dashed the scheme by replying , " They 'd weigh practically the same . " Well , we would be profligate . We 'd take the bananas . We went down to the office where Mrs. Meek , the nice English proprietress of the pension , was already on duty . She kept tropical hours and was always at her desk at five . It was nothing , she said , to rise a little earlier to see us off . The pale light had slowly warmed the sky when the expected motor turned into the drive promptly at a quarter before five . Even Mrs. Meek then shared our sense of excitement , for she began toscurry about , saying she 'd intended to give us cotton . Now she could n't find any . ? Well , we must go . But we must be sure to tell them in the plane to givr us cotton . " Cotton for your ears , you know . " The motor stopped . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague shapes of three men in the car . They were speaking German in deep guttural voices ; for the Scadta Company is organized and directed . by Germans . " Be sure , " Mrs. Meek was repeating , " to remind them to give you cotton ? " That . . and that she would take good care of our trunks and bags until we returned . And then the little light of her office was left behind and we jolted out on the streets and through the sleeping town . The streets were narrow , incredibly rough and dusty with the profound dust of Barranquilla when for eight months it has forgotten to rain . We swung so alarmingly round curves that we had to cling to our seats while we coughed in the thick choking dust . We stopped suddenly . A man got into the car , and there was more German . It was light enough now to see the tanned florid faces of the men and the brown flannel and khaki in which they were dressed . We drew up before another house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Already lie has gone , " she said in the soft rapid Spanish of the coast . And we went on . The sky was now rose and the little white one-story houses more distinct . Then at last we turned steeply down to the hangars . There two machines had been dragged out and stood ready for flight ? the Bogotd and the Cauca . As our luggage was placed on the scales we dismissed the involuntary and futile impulse to discuss whether we should be weighed with or without our heavy coats . There was no evading the scales of the Scadta . They registered , I felt , even one 's thoughts . After our bags and the camera , we got on the scales . It was dark inside the hangar and they had to strike matches to read the figures . Even with my coat , I was still fortunately one kilo ? two and two tenths pounds ? under the weight allowed for the minimum charge of two hundred and fifty dollars , so that our united weights , plus coats , were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcases , one camera , my note book and pencils , and the two bananas brought us up to thirty-nine kilos excess , and our day 's adventure to a total of six hundred and thirty-five dollars ! While the bill was being settled I walked over to the poised and waiting planes . The sky was now rose , and rose lay along the river . In the air was the brief freshness of tropic dawn . While I waited the Bogotd speeded up and ' shot whirring out over the water . She skimmed , left the river , and was off . She carried no passengers . She was flying with bank notes to the value of a million and a half dollars . In the capital city of Bogota , nearly a thousand miles away on the Andean Plateau , a hank had failed ; the Banco Lopez ; the great house of Lopez with commercial and agricultural and shipping interests all over Colombia . Lopez had failed and panic was threatened . To prevent a demoralized ran on all banks , the Government had added two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on the date of our flight . During these days of fiesta , planes were to rush bank notes up from the coast and from the interior city of Medellin . So I watched the hydroplane Bogotd fly from Barranquilla with millions in bank notes . And as though symbolic of its mission , the sky had become gold , and gold the water , gold with heavy blue overhanging clouds . When we finally climbed up over the left wing and into the Cauca , about to explore the Magdalena from the air , that six hundred and thirty-five dollars seemed absurdly little to pay for so glorious an adventure . We took our places in the little coup &; built to carry four passengers , but never taking more than two on these difficult flights into the interior . We speeded over the surface with swishing foam . But we did not rise . We ran across the river in the hope of picking up a helpful breath of air . We turned down stream . We ran up stream , ; ant still in vain . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the waves until at last our pontoons were free from the friction of the water long enough to permit us to acquire the necessary momentum . And then . . . then the river dropped away ! Was it a foot away ? No , in the time it took to think that , it was a yard . A yard ? Why , it was ever so much more than a yard ! The river dropped and was still dropping . . . . We were flying ! Actually flying ! The sun had risen in a salmon sky . It was a quarter to six , and we were flying . . . with the river now far below us . BY AIR TO THE HEART OF THE ANDES q93 Forty-five minutes later we passed the town of Calamar . Two days before it had taken us ten hours by river steamer to cover the distance between Calamar and Barranquilla . We made that distance now by airplane in forty-five minutes . As Colombia unfolded beneath us I realized not only how flight is to annihilate distance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will supplement that close and intimate study which every author must make of the land he is to describe . We beheld Colombia thus immensely unfold and reveal itself . It showed us on the right the Pique - the famous canal of the days of Philip II of Spain . We saw the Pique stretch away , a straight silver line between lush green banks , connecting Cartagena on the coast with the great waterway of the Magdalena at Calamar . AL half-past seven we flew over a tiny stream which we knew to be the " Brazo de Loba , " an erratic arm of the Lower Magdalena which branches off at El Banco , and , after receiving the waters of the Cauca , rejoins the parent river , bearing with it the broad waters which have come down from the most fruitful I and romantic region of Colombia . In the vast valley of the Magdalena over which we flew there was water everywhere : lakes and ponds . streams big and little ; ponds and lakes and streams ; straight streams and serpentine streams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself divided and subdivided , sending out gleaming arms to embrace green islets . Far away on our left rose the costal range of the Santa Marta mountains , deeply blue with their white heads lost in clouds . We calculated that in each hour of flight we were covering a distance which by river steamer would require an entire day . When , at ten minutes of eight , the old Spanish town of Mompox was diagramed beneath us , we knew that we were two days by river from Barranquilla , which we had left just two hours before . We were then flying low enough to get a sharply defined portrait of Mom-pox , with its streets geometrically laid out , its Moorish convent built about a square central patio , its church towers , its cathedral facing as always the plaza , and over all , roofs of dull red tile . I knew how hot and drowsy was the air in such a town , how blindingly the sun whitened the white walls of the houses , and how , from time to time the bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seemed to hear those far-off bells , although in reality there was only the ceaseless deafening roar of the plane which penetrated the protecting cotton in my ears . I had often thought that travel was , among many other more important things , living geography . I now realized that flying was geography dramatized , and so impressively dramatized that I was able later to astonish Colombians ? and myself ? by my knowledge of the Departamentos into which their country is divided . I had learned without any conscious effort that , as one flies toward the interior , there is on the right the Departamento of Atlantic ? , with Barranquilla as its capital : that the Dique leads into the Departamento of Bolivar , whose capital is the historic old walled town of Cartagena , besieged so often by pirates and buccaneers . And I could always visualize on the left bank the great Departamento of Magdalena , with its capital at Santa Marta , in one of the banana centers of the world . I knew , too , the rivers and the long ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting Colombia into isolated sections . The map had become for me a living thing , of green and blue , of silver and copper . In no other way can the travel author so comprehend the contour of a land . I considered the impression which I retain after a study of other great rivers . I took , for example , the Yangtse which flows from the western borders of China , across the huge territory of the Celestial Kingdom , three thousand miles to the Yellow Sea . And my memory I found to be made up of details , seen intimately , but without perspective . I saw the brown fields of winter with everywhere grave-mounds lonely or in friendly clusters , graves brown against a lifeless sky . I saw high cliffs and giant reeds and clumps of green bamboo . And along the way I visited Chinkiang , Nanking , Wulm , and Kinkiang . I remember the trotting rickshaws , the shops and the soft glow of colored lanterns , globes of warm color . The red-and-gold signs of the shops had charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silks and embroideries " and the " Shop of Extensive Harmony dealing in carved ivories and silver work . " In one of these shops we had bought salt and pepper shakers in the form of little silver pagodas , and the old Chinaman who sold , them had a face like a carved netsuke of ivory . I remember riots and dead Chinamen on the swarming Bund at Hankow under the flaunting flags of then great nations , German and Russian , as well as French and British and American . And there still comes to my ears the mournful chant of toiling coolies . All this ? and much more ? I found indelibly etched . But I had seen no farther than the banks of the Yangtse . I never knew what manner of China lay beyond my narrow horizon . In looking out from the air over the vast unrolling panorama of Colombia I suddenly understood that studying a country without the airplane is like examining a human countenance bit by bit : an isolated eye , a detached mouth , an eyebrow ; and then by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see the face as a whole . I was later to study Colombia intimately , feature by feature , but now in the air I saw in perspective the face of the land . It was like looking upon the broad sweep of an artist 's creation as it exists in his mind , seen in the mass with the detail to be developed later . Flying thus over Colombia , I began to realize that I was to know this country as I knew no other . And then we made our first descent . At twenty minutes past eight we came down at El Banco to deliver the mail , for the Seadta conducts the largest private mail service in the world , and El Banco in the Departamento of Madgalena is its first port of call . There we took gasoline and the careful mechanic inspected the sparkplugs . When we rose from El Banco it was to pass through a frothy sea of cloud , soft and thick and white ; on up above this to clear air . Through breaks between cloud and cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Motilones Indians , reached only by canoe up the Cesar River . Bait the Motilones are seldom disturbed by adventuring canoes , and when they are , what are poisoned arrows for ; if not to provide meat for the tribe ? The rumor of cannibals , and the longest regular hydroplane service in the world ! That is perspective indeed . No wonder that flying in Colombia had so captivated my imagination ! As we flew we could see between those intervals of cloud that we were passingover stream and forest . We saw also the little river port , Puerto Wilches , from which five days on mules over precipitous mountains , will carry one to the city of Bucaramanga , capital of the Departamento of Santander . From much acquaintance with Spanish-American towns , I knew that there also would be Moorish monasteries , plazas , red-tiled roofs and church bells . Bucaramanga was especially interesting because at that moment the Rockefeller Foundation and the Colombian Government were waging wir . upon yellow fever , a battle in which yellow fever is forever destined to lose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at Barranca Bermeja we ate those two bananas whose aerial transportation had brought their cost up to at least fifty cents apiece in a country where bananas are to be had almost for the asking . After El Banco I realized that the horizon mountains had imperceptibly drawn closer . They had removed the haze in which they had been enveloped . They were nearer , higher , and more dis- tinct . With their approach the country had become less marshy . We had left behind the grassy fields and orderly rows of bananas . We flew above forests across which drifted cloud shadows , forests where copper streams cut through deeply green masses of jungle . In this changing scene from an airplane lies undiscovered country for the illustrator of a travel book . Fantastic problems of composition offer themselves . A new type of artist will be developed . This artist must be as quick as a sportsman who shoots on the wing ; since he must , also on the wing , register swift images of color and composition . Here the aerial photographer becomes invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new form of art which will portray the earth from the air . As we rose higher filmy clouds blew through us . They seemed to be going somewhere in a hurry . Far below was a lake . It seemed a little lake and it was full of shadows of trees round its margin and of clouds passing over it . The blue shadows on the treetops were deep dark pools with strange outlines . The river lay like a bronze serpent . We often fell into pockets of air ? holes in the air ? and climbed out again , keeping our equilibrium by a continual sideways tipping of our wings . We tipped and veered . and then tipped and veered again . I felt that we had ceased to be a machine and had become a monster bird with powerful vibrating heart and sensitive wings . A little later we are descending above Barranca Bermeja , with the houses and offices and tanks of the Tropical Oil Company like mushrooms in hot glaring rows . These buildings grow quickly larger , and all at once a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a child in the canoe . The child becomes immediately a man , and the man has fruit piled on the bottom of the canoe . We are turning , banking down to the river ; turning sharply down with tre mendous rush and speed and whirr . We skim above the water . . . low . . . very low . We strike with a bump ; a series of bumps , diminishing until we glide smoothly , like the fastest launch in the world , and finally come skillfully to rest at Barranca Bermeja . It was very hot at Barranca Bermeja . Our pilot sat on one of the pontoons under the shadow of a wing , while the mechanic took on gas and replaced the used spark plugs with fresh ones . We waited under the inadequate shade of the projecting roof of a little corrugated iron shed . The heat was breathless . We fell into questioning talk with a group of men who had gathered to see us land . " Has the Calmar passed yet ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that either . " " The Perez Rosa ? " " Nor that . " Boats which had left Barranquilla days before the Cauca had lifted herself into the air to fly for Girardot , six hundred miles into the interior , had not yet passed Barranca Bermeja . We had flown over them , indistinguishable specks on the river , crawling up against the swirling current at the rate of four miles an hour . Up that same river four centuries ago 0 the Spanish conqueror Quesada had spent terrible and painful months in reaching this port of Barranca Bermeja . From Barranca the run to Puerto Berrio is short , and there we had also mail to deliver . And there the pilot allowed us a " little half hour " for lunch . No Arabian night 's dream was ever more glamourous than that lunch . The sun was as dazzling as the sun in a fairy tale of the tropics . The palms were as strangely beautiful as palms seen for the first time ; or after a long absence , much as a spirit might regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more upon straight smooth-columned palms lifting regal heads about a white and balconied hotel ; a hotel which was approached from the river by a long flight of steps , also white and hot in that fairy sun ; steps up and down which nothing would be too marvelous to pass . So upon return to earth froth the air is a spell cast over all things . For the travel author who seeks ever to keep alive the child-wonder of his soul , there is in this return to earth an enhancement of that wide-eyed delight . The lunch at Puerto Berrio had also the fleeting quality of a young dream , for it was indeed a " little half hour " that our pilot had allotted us . And in obedience to a summons delivered by a small brown urchin , we hurried down those long steps to resume our places in the hydroplane Cauca , A-9 , waiting to fly to Girardot . In the river we found moored a sister plane , the Santander . Puerto Berrio is the port for Medellin , capital of Antioquia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Santander was waiting for the train from Medellin which was to bring more bank notes to avert the threatened panic in Bogota . At Puerto Berrio I am convinced no breath of air ever even faintly stirs . We vainly maneuvered up and down the river . It was impossible to rise . The pilot passed over our two bags to the Santander which was to follow us . We made another attempt and , relieved of just those few pounds , we skimmed the surface , and so lightly did we touch the water that we left only the merest line on its sheen . We skimmed and suddenly the river dropped . . . . We were up ! The miracle of ascent was by this time sufficiently familiar for me to analyze it in penciled notes : Up . . We rise as if lifted by great breaths . The breaths come in big puffs as though a giant breathed , refilled his lungs and breathed again . . . . Lift .. . Soar while the giant inhales . Lift . .. . Soar over broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . lift . . . tip - . and soar . . . A copper river comes flowing into the Magdalena . . . . Lift . . . with the powerful breath of the giant . Lift and soar . . . Blue haze lies on the mountains . Blue as the sky . . . . We tip with that slight rocking from side to side . And always we vibrate with the force of the engine 's explosions , and always there is the beat , the throbbing , ceaseless throbbing of the exhaust . There is no word to describe that all-pervading , deafening sound ; for language was made before men flew . A white sand bank glistens in the middle of the river . We fall into a series of pockets . We climb out . We soar and rock . There are fewer cloud-shadows on the land . Our breeze stiffens . The great throbbing buzz is louder . . . . Pocket . . . . Lift . . . Mountains like blue waves on the right , like waves of surf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only of the lift and fall , the rocking of the wings , and the vibration . But none of these things ? not even the violence of the breeze gives me a sense of speed . The ever-changing landscape itself does not move . It simply changes . There is now a lake which magically becomes a forest and again a lake ; a forest turns into a peak and a peak becomes a river of burnished bronze . The mountains have advanced on their march to the river 's bank . The valley shrinks before these encroaching Andes on which lie purple shadows , large still shadows . We lift and rock and soar . We look at the valley through blue haze . In the lap of the hills lie fleecy clouds . We climb to more steady air with a mighty lift which makes me catch my breath . The Santander passes us bound for Girardot direct with a million and a half in paper money and our two travel-worn suitcases . Here I felt a greater sense of altitude than earlier in the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look down . We fly through space ! I love to put my head out the window and to look down through this space to the earth . I have so loved the beauty of that earth that it is strange I should glory in the sensation of complete severance from it . This severance is a separation more absolute than death , for in flight not even one 's dust and ashes remain upon the familiar little planet . I love to realize this space and this severance ? to dwell upon it . I had never imagined that flying would do something for the soul . Now after the thrill of adventure I found it a deep spiritual experience . For up there in the air , gazing down through space to a little earth with which one has no longer any tangible physical connection , things fall into their proper places and one comprehends in a radiant flash what is of moment and eternal . All else fades and has no significance . This perspective differs from the perspective of memory . Memory is intimate , personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy it often fails to escape prejudice . The detachment of flight encourages impersonal perspective , and impersonality makes for fairness and justice . I look down . There is a little boat on the ribbon of river , but I know from its shape that it is one of the big flat river steamers . Later I traveled down the Magdalena on a similar boat . The memory of it is vivid . I can recall every face on board . Gestures and intonations come back to me . With my propensity for fancying myself some one else , I become a barefoot , sandaled Franciscan monk in a heavyrobe of brown wool . I feel the heat of the robe , for in the person of this monk I have come . down from a monastery in cool Bogota on my way to Medellin . And after the confining peace of my convent the world is a big and exciting place , and the journey on a river boat so adventurous that in the simple wonder at it all , I almost forget the heat of my hooded robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marches about with his hands in his pockets . It is his first trip down to the coast and he is so eager to see alligators that he finds life in every log and stump and is forever crying out falsely that there is a caimdri and there another . Again I become a fat general in a messy white uniform . He has important mustaches . His face is deeply scarred , and when I am that general my mind is lurid with battle and blood . I slip thus easily from personality to personality , until I find myself back in my own incarnation , and I am on deck in one of the big cane rocking chairs of the Magdalena river boats . I am gazing into the deep dark heart . of the jungle , reliving the life of such a jungle , listening once more to the voices of a tropical forest . Of such is the precious perspective of memory . I look down from the air upon a Magdalena , river boat and it is just a little creeping thing . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that such a slowly moving speck carries that vital cargo of tenderness and greed , cruelty and kindness , peace and ambition . Those specks which are boats seem so small as they move on the face of the river , and the river itself so small in the mountain-circled valley . The people down there know nothing of the bold free sweep of great horizons . Their vision i'as limited as mine had been on the Yangtse limited by the banks of the stream . For them there is no luminous emancipation of unchained vision . In looking down through that space which separates the world from the plane , earth-memories crowd the mind , but the soul is withdrawn . For a fleeting fraction of time it is drawn hack into the calm of the universal soul . Peace and stillness possess it . And so I love to put my head out of the window , to feel the force of the wind we create , and to gaze silently . . . down through space . . - I gaze , and again the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about us is the wild world of the Andes . There is no settlement or sign of life until we drop down , through the zone of bumpy air , to Honda ; dropping into air as dry and burning as if it had been passed through a furnace . We land on the sandy beach . After the cool aerial heights , Honda is hot beyond imagination or belief . We leave the mail , take on more gas , and again rise , still with painful effort ; no sooner are we up than we immediately descend , for the pilot has noted an alarming sound in the engine . He explains in his German-Spanish that repairs are necessary before we can go on . They will take at least two hours . Perhaps more . Meanwhile he will telephone to Girardot for another plane . But it is Independence Day . Offices are closed . He is unable to get the message through . We cannot. land at Girardot after dark . And all our luggage has flown on in the Santander . We are in Honda without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade , on the roots of a spreading tree , a honga tree . To these new casualties of the way the air traveler must adapt himself , just as formerly he was philosophical about fording streams , or about mules which elected to roll while his most treasured belongings were still strapped to their hacks . So I sit waiting , strangely not for mules , but for the engine of a hydroplane to be repaired . Because it is a holiday the citizens of Honda are strolling about in their best clothes . They come to stare and to ask me where I come from and where I am going and why . I fan with a little Japanese silk fan which all through the hot country I have worn on a chain round my neck , and I reply as tru thfully as may be to those questions put by the citizens of Honda ; questions still unanswered by the race of man . Where are we going ? And why ? Meanwhile the mechanic and the pilot bury their heads under the hood of the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not very illuminatingly to me , I confess . " The magneto is a tooth behind . " With that they disappear again under the hood . And the citizens of Honda , having obtained from me all possible informaLion , return to impart it to the rest of the population , leaving me to meditate and fan . " So this , " I reflect , " this is Honda . " Over the grim bare mountains which come down to the river , still climbs the old Muisca trail , which was for centuries the only way into Bogot ? , the capital , nearly 9,000 feet high . Once all the varied life of that capital passed over the trail . Plenipotentiaries , viceroys and bishops , fine ladies and generals , pianos and Paris hats , all traveled the Muisea trail on mule-back , three days ' journey up from the river . The Girardot-to-Bogoth railroad is comparatively recent , and with its completion all riches and elegance deserted the old trail . Freight rates , however , are high , and long lines of mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Honda , journeying back with goods from the outside world . But the Muisca trail can never recover its lost importance . As the river steamers have changed the river and the life upon the river , affecting even the jungle whichmirrors itself in the rapid current , so the coming of the railroad has robbed the trail of its ancient splendor . And now the ship of the air is here . It must in turn inevitably influence civilization everywhere . We do not yet begin to appreciate all that it may mean . It is still so new . But it will be the task of the travel writer to interpret the world that is to he , and we can not , if we would , stop the time-clock . But as I sit in the heat under the spreading tree at Honda , a line of mules trots in the dust of the trail just beyond the tree . And for one little moment I would sweep away even the wonder of flight if I could go back to the old days on the Muisca trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German language emerged from the depths of the hood to announce that we might now start . And in the thrill of ascent I am afraid I forgot the little dusty line of mules . We rose easily and lightly out of the scorching valley of Honda . The giant was again lifting us with mighty puffs , lifting us up through rough air to air as smooth as new macadam . The Honda trail crawled over the mountains until we saw it as a mere thread which- we were soon too high to distinguish any longer . Somewhere on our upward climb the Santander appeared , coming to the rescue , to see what was the matter , for we were long past the hour we were due in Girardot . We waved " all 's well ! " and the Santander continued back to Puerto Berrio . Its passing left us in a world inhabited only by mountains . The forests of the Magdalena valley had disappeared , but so had the valley . The river no longer spread itself over the map . It twisted at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularly clear light so characteristic of the high Andes the mountains shimmered in color : violet and mauve , rose and orange ; soft uncertain patches of color with vague outlines . As we mounted , the Andes themselves seemed also to mount , to become higher and again higher ; range upon range to the horizon . I got a sensation of sheer height , towering height , unlike anything I ever experienced from the ground , even in the grandeur of the Himalayas . The sun was low and dazzling . We flew high . We were no longer lifted . We fell into no more air pockets . There seemed even no slightest rocking of the wings . There was only the vibration , the great throbbing roar , and when I put my head out of the window , the strong rushing wind . The sun was sinking fast . On the right the snowy dome of Tolima , chaste and symmetrical , lifted its head from a cloud lake of flame . All about us were piled high these Andes and there were Andes also below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and were making a short cut over a range whose jagged upturned edge was like a colossal saw . These were painted mountains , as colorful as the Grand Canyon , while their deep gorges caught and imprisoned purple-velvet shadows . An ever-changing opalescence played over the snow summit of Ruiz . Tolima now stood coldly , deathly white against a fantastic cloud of midnight blue . Then in a moment the sun was gone . And there , six hundred miles from Barranquilla , we had seen as only an airplane could show us , the majestic glory of its setting upon the stupendous Andean world . We hovered there a moment as though even the great pulsating creature of mechanism hesitated and was reluctant , but below lay Girardot , the point from which we were to proceed by mountain railroad to Bogota on the high plateau . We had , therefore , to descend , yet we hovered in the glory of the afterglow , before speeding dizzily from sky to earth , hovered and then plunged . And all at once the adventure was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had enjoyed the day and to bid ceremonious farewell , while on the river bank a competent urchin waited with our bags left in his care by the Santander . I walked again on the earth , hot through my shoes ; and as I had not been able to talk in the night at Barranquilla because in the morning I was to fly , because I had flown I was for a time disposed to silence . " This is the earth , " I thought , " and we are so much part of it that all in us which is material is thus inevitably returned . I walk on the earth but I . have been in the sky , and both arc now forever changed . The earth is become new ; the old mystery and the old beauty newly revealed . Walking that new earth , I may look up and remember ; knowing how it is to join a white band of scurrying clouds , or to participate in a sunset ; knowing , too , a strange undreamed of loveliness ? the loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky I may ever recapture peace and liberation , for my spirit has learned to fly .
