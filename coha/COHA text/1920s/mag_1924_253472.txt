The whole world , witnessing the ease in the American money markets and our superabundance of gold , has been watching for our commodity prices to rise under " gold inflation . " Thus far , however , it has watched in vain . Indeed , according to the U. S. Department of Labor indices of wholesale prices for June , commodity prices in this country were falling instead of rising . The index weighted index number , which includes 404 commodities , fell to 144.6 for June , from 146.9 in May and 153.5 for June , 1923 . It has declined steadily since February , 1924 , when it was 152 . <P> The drop of prices during June was caused chiefly by declines in farm products from 136 to 134 , in food from 137 to 136 , in fuel from 177 to 175 , in metals and metal products from 134 to 132 , in building materials from 180 to 173 , in house furnishings from 173 to 172 and in miscellaneous from 112 to 111 , compared with the previous month of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained unchanged at 187 , and chemicals and drugs at 127 . As between May and June last , of the 404 commodities checked , there were 137 decreases , 103 increases , and 164 cases where prices did not change . <P> What the same index will show for the present month is , of course , conjectural at present . Farm products will be higher , of course . Yet it is obvious that the advance in grain prices is not due to " gold inflation " but to crop failures . The prophets of American inflation may ultimately be right , but so far the facts give little comfort to their theories .
