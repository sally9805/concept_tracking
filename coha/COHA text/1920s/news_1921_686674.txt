Kearns declared he had no objection to the selection of a referee holding . a New Jersey license , but that he would insist on having a voice in the selection . He asserted that he would be willing to have the names of all referees licensed In the State thrown , into a hat and allow himself and Francois Descamps , manager of Carpentier , to draw for the third man In the ring . , " I will absolutely refuse to let Dempsey box if they- insist on naming the referee , " Kearns declared . Members of the New Jersey Boxing Commission arrived here tonight ostensibly to witness some boxing bouts , but it is probable they will have a conference with Kearns , Robert Edgren , final arbiter of all disputes involving the two boxers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyons said that a Jersey man would referee or there would be no fight . " If the Jersey people insist on a Jersey referee , it 's all right with me , " Kearns said . " I am willing to take any Jersey referee , but I am not going to be dictated -- te , ' Its , : to. - iwhien one it wilt be . Proposes Drawing from nat . " I have a million dollar asset in Dempsey . I am not going to stick him into the ring on July 2 with Carpentier unless assured the referee is unprejudiced , will let the men fight it out fairly and will be capable . Dempsey can take care of himself . But when I turn him loose I want him to fight one man , not two . " I am- willing to have the . New Jersey Commission put the names of all licensed Jersey referees in a hat and let Descamps and me draw for the referee . ' The fighters ought to have something to say , particularly the champion , who has much at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , ' no matter what it costs Dempsey and me . If we do n't box , we will still have the title and that is worth a whole lot in the hands of a great fighter like Dempsey . " I am not insisting on Jim Dougherty of Philadelphia . Dougherty is all right and a good referee and 1 will be glad to have him , but I am not demanding any . one referee . " Look at the- mess we got into at Toledo . When Dempsey is taking a chance like this . , he is going to be pre- . pared to the extent of getting an . even break . " Myons Insists on Rights . ? Lyons says the referee will be a Jersey man . " We reserve the right to think that New Jersey has just as competent men for ' the place of referee as any place in the country , " he said . " So far as any talk , of the articles of agreement between the fighters and their managers is concerned , let me say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey . The law arranges for the members of the State Boxing Commission naming the man who is to act , and we shall see that the law is carried out . There is nctihing to hide about the action of the Boxing Commission in the referee matter . ' A full statement of the action and reasons for action of myself which . an effort will be made to satisfactorily adjust the referee situation . Kearns has arranged for a trip to this , city and has arranged with the promotes for a meeting in Rickard 's offices in Madison Square Garden . Whatever decision is reached at tomorrow 's con-1 ference probably will be submitted to the New Jersey Boxing Commission at - its meeting Wednesday . and the other members of the commission will be issued in proper time . " Commissioner Lyons also commented on the probable action of the New Jersey rulers of boxing concerning any interference , or attempted interference , relative to the big fight from managers or supporters of either principal . " There will be adequate arrangements made , " he declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming championship battle on the part of any supporter of a contestant . Enough special men will be stationed around the ring at Jersey City to assure that nothing but a knockout or the reaching of the legitimate limit of the battle will end the contest . " The statement from Bob Edgren to the effect that he favors former Champion Jim Jeffries also came as a surprise to the many ring followers now at the shore . Edgren appears to have the full confidence of Dempsey , Kearns and others concerned in the championship battle , and his statement may be in line of paving the way of asking the New Jersey Boxing Commission to select Jeffries as a compromise candidate for the ? honor as third man in the ring . " I take Jim Jeffries to be able , honest and big enough in the fight game to have the confidence of the public , " said Edgren concerning Jeffries , who , by the way , has not yet taken out a license under the law . Dempsey Disappointed . Champion . Dempsey appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive in time to witness his ring work this afternoon , but fought his hardest . during the three two-round battles with Eddie O'Hara , Joe Benjamin and Irish Patsy Cline . The latter two he allowed to batter . him , confining himself to defense tactics , but he gave O'Hara six minutes of fast dodging and ducking to escape his attacks . Dempsey and his sparring partners wore the leather head gears . The champion removed his for the final round with O'Hara when the hot sun made his artificial head defense uncomfortable . Nearly a thousand spectators paid gate money to witness the workouts . K. O. Bill Brennan , who fought Dempsey in Madison Square Garden , was among the interested spectators at the ringside this afternoon . Spectators crowded around when Brennan stopped Dempsey after his workout and congratulated the champion on his fine form and action in the ring . " I 'd like to have this man Carpentier first , " stated Brennan . " Well , you are welcome to him after I get through with him , " Dempsey retorted . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reached ? you , " Brennan replied with a chuckle . " There would n't have been anything left . " Brennan admitted that he was a bit put out about the stories ' published in the East to the effect that , he was beaten by Billy Misko . . He insisted upon showing a number of newspaper clippings which showed that ' he led the fight all the way . Battling Ghee , the big Memphis negro fighter , whom Dempsey laced to a near knockout yesterday , did not appear in the ring today , but was at the ringside happy oler the publicity he had attained . " ft done cost me $9.70 already for clippings about me this morning . " he said , and I got more columns written about me than I ever got since I been a fightin ' man . " Ghee has two loose teeth as a result of the Dempsey attack in the ring yesterday afternoon , and is pretty badly battered generally . ? Rickard declared that he will have a conference with Kearns tomorrow , at " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re port from Atlantic City that Jack Kearns would not allow the Dempsey- ' Carpentier bout to take place in Jersey City unless he had a say in the selection of a referee . Tex Rickard at Madison Square Garden last night said he placed little credence in what Kearns was alleged to have said . Rickard pointed out that the New Jer- ' sey Boxing Commission has the power to select any referee it chooses for a boxing bout held within ' its territory and that it is up to Kearns and Dempsey to , abide ' by the Boxing Commission 's decision . He said that Frant.ois Descamps , manager for Carpentier , had already expressed his willingness to stand by any decision of the New Jersey Commission . " It sounds like foolish talk to me , " said Rickard . " Of course , Kearns must realize that by any such action attributed to him he stands in danger of forfeiting the $50,000 already posted according to the contracts made . " Rickard said he does not intend to attend the meeting of the , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be present ' at a meeting of the commission next Wednesday , when it is expected the selection of a referee will be made .
