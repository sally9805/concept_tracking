By a vote of 253 to 94 the House of Commons passed a bill providing for a 10,000,000 ( $46,500,000 ) naval base at Singapore-extreme south of the Malay Peninsula . It was stated that Britain had no port in the Far East where a capital ship could be docked . It was felt , nevertheless , that while the projected naval base was not actually a breach of the Washington Conference Naval Treaty it certainly infringed the spirit of the agreement . Colonel Amery , First Lord of the Admiralty , in his speech said that the base was designed to maintain the British navy in eastern waters . He then remarked : " No self-respecting Power can afford indefinitely to be dependent upon another power for its security and even for its existence .
