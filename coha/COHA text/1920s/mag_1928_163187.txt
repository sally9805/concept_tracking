The machinery of the New York Stock Exchange last week clamped down on the soul of a boy three years out of high school . Seymour N. Sears Jr. , 22 , of Grantwood , N. J. , " floor " telephone clerk for Miller , Hewitt &; Dodge , brokers , became a partner of that firm and at the same time a member of the Exchange ( the youngest so distinguished ) . Seats on the Exchange are currently worth $395,000 . Young men who " buy " them at such prices raise the money by bonding themselves and insuring their lives in favor of their creditors , and give private noi.es for the sum . Since a pronouncement by the Exchange management last week , under certain conditions they can also mortgage their membership . To pay back the purchase money takes the member 15 to 20 years . <P> A few very rich men are among the 1,100 Stock Exchange members . But they are not active traders . The work is too mechanical for them to dissipate their wits on . They consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy and sell securities upon orders . The real thinking is done at their offices , in smoky " customers ' rooms , " over the cocktails of big speculators . Some day machines activated by perforated and notched discs may do the trading on stock exchanges . <P> Meanwhile young men , like Mr. Sears , with strong legs and loud voices , trade three and four million shares a day on the New York Exchange .
