 | DEAR CLARE : I am sorry you have been so ill ! It is disappointing that the gay , carefree months which you foresaw have been shadowed with suffering and darkened by doctors ' bills ! I am sorrier still that you feel I have neglected you during this trying time ; that if I really had sympathized with you I would have " managed somehow " to write you long , cheery letters , instead of sending " an occasional telegram or box of flowers . " But now that I can sit down and write you a long letter ? though whether cheering or not I shall have to leave to you to decide ! ? I feel justified in beginning it by saying that you and an isolated woman who recently wrote me that " of course I could not understand her position , because I did not know what it was to stay in the same place for any length of time " are both approaching me with an equal disregard for the facts . As you know , I lived summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest village , and in a climate which , in itself , effects isolation for many months each year ; so , to use a convenient slang expression , I think I could give my correspondent ? who lives in the sunniest part of the sunniest South ? cards and spades on the subject of a secluded life ! And , my dear , I could do the same with you on the subject of sickness . For though I have not spent many days in bed this last winter , it is only because I have literally been forced , by the pressure of circumstances , to keep going . You may recall that early in the course of my worldtrip I had a fall which aggravated an already existing back trouble . For a year and a half the resultant injury received no adequate attention , though sometimes it kept me paralyzed with pain for days together . In the meantime I took four boats with ambulances ; contracted sandfly fever and a few other diseases of which we scarcely know the names ? much less suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son go down to the valley of the shadow of death , linger there for weeks , and finally , by the slowest of slow degrees , pull himself out , and on to the mountain peaks of health again . This sort of experience takes a certain toll of reserve strength , especially if one sticks to one 's work throughout it ; and when I finally reached home , had my back X-rayed , and discovered that a serious trouble existed which could not possibly be remedied unless I were strapped into a steel harness ? well , I felt as if I simply could not bear it , as if the last slender thread which held my self-control together were going to snap . What could I write you that would be cheering to you ? That if I finally went to sleep , after long hours of tense wakefulness , it was to wake again , the tears rolling down my cheeks , imagining that I was back in Singapore again , and that my boy was dying twelve thousand miles from home ? That I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the bed and pushing a chair in front of me , and reached my desk without once standing upright ? That my " family treasure " Kathie , hitherto my prop and mainstay at such times ? for there have been equally hard times in the past over and over again ? was borne away to the hospital for an emergency operation when things were at their very worst with me , and all three boys home for the holidays , and we had moved into a new unfurnished apartment the week beore ? Why , Clare , telegrams and roses were the only things I could send , if I were not to pour out all my troubles to you when you were not fit to hear them ! I dared not trust myself to write . But now that I am better ? and you are , too , thank heaven ! ? let us consider this subject of sickness together , as we have considered so many things in the past that  | concerned us mutually . What , in these past few years , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle age ? let us not only admit it , but glory in it , for to me , at least , it has been so much more wonderful than youth ? and we need to consider our health more than we did in our teens . Our nervous systems , owing to our many responsibilities , are under much heavier and more constant strain than they were then ; our powers of recuperation are considerably lessened ? a child is sick , and then it is well , with almost no trying period of convalescence with which to battle , such is the resiliency of youth ; but this , alas ! is not the case with us ; and our physical well-being is of vast importance , not only to ourselves , but to our families , and in many cases to our jobs . All this being indubitably true , we have no possible excuse if we do not take proper precautions to safeguard our health , to see to it not only that we are cured when we are ill , but that we do not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place . And about this almost all of us are criminally careless . We are warned that certain foods , harmless to most persons , are , on account of some personal idiosyncrasy , poisonous to us ; and then we go ahead and eat them just the same . . . " Yes , any kind of sea-food makes me deathly sick , but Ella had the most wonderful shrimp and lobster Newburg at her party , and Harry simply heaped my plate with it ? yes , terrible , my dear , in the middle of the night , and I 've felt like a ghost ever since . " It has a familiar ring , has n't it ? We think of it as a frightful ordeal to go to our dentist ? I confess freely to only three causes of fear in the course of my life : elevators , snakes , and dentists ? and so , instead of visiting him once in six months ? in which case it would not be much of an ordeal ! ? we put it off and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by unbearable pain , we suffer tortures before we escape from him . We fail to submit to regular physical examinations , because we may be told something is radically wrong " and that would be upsetting " ; and then when that queer feeling of vertigo and depression has landed us flat on our back in a dead faint , we " come to " and hear the family doctor murmuring reproachfully : My dear lady , there 's evidently been something a little wrong with your heart for some time . If I 'd seen you even a few weeks ago , I think you could have continued to be moderately active , under treatment . Now you may take your choice between lying very still here in bed , or much more still ? under a neat white tombstone in your family lot . " We journey blithely away to beautiful , exotic lands where every prospect pleases and only the drinking water is vile , and helplessly rage when our junketing is interrupted by typhoid fever , and we spend weary , endless days in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with packing and passports and everything , to be inoculated for typhoid before we started . " This is the sort of thing most of us do ? and then blame the doctor and the Deity for our fate . We have much to be thankful for that both do not call down vengeance upon our heads . Having become ill , we usually fall promply into another error . Illness is a tedious , as well as a painful business , and we imagine we ought to be making a more rapid recovery than we are doing ; that it is probably our doctor 's fault , and not our own , that we are not . If he urges us to stay in bed , we feel that we should be better off if we were allowed to make more of an effort . If he jerks us to our feet , we are sure that a complete rest is what we really @#  | need . If he gives us no medicine , we are sure he does not appreciate how low we really are . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old school , completely out of date . And our own line of reasoning is extended indefinitely by our friends . I can truthfully say that I have never been ill in my life when every well-wisher who came to see me did not I suggest that I would be much better off under some other form of treatment . Some of these suggestions have been so fantastic that I can laugh about them now ; but at the time they tempted me , as they tempt most women ? we grasp for get-well-quick magic just as avidly as we do for get-rich-quick magic ' We should put these temptations behind us . No doctor , however learned , however skilled . can effect a cure without the cooperation and confidence of his patient ; and if the complaint was sufficiently serious to require his attention in the first place , the chances are that he can not effect this cure immediately . If after a fair trial-and the length of time that a fair trial should last depends entirely upon circumstances ? it is evident that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten , suggest that another opinion should be sought . It is only the tenth time that we need to act for ourselves . The Good Old Family Doctor I think perhaps this is the time and place to put in a word concerning the general practitioner and the specialist . In this age of concentration , it is inevitable that one doctor should know more about our throats than our hearts , and that another should know more about our stomachs than either of the others . It is also inevitable that a specialist should bend all his energies to the care and healing of that part of the human body that he understands best ; and in doing this ? just as inevitably ? he can not be too much concerned about the rest of it . The woman who goes to a specialist , without first consulting her family doctor , who alone knows all her physical eccentricities , and having him recommend the physician best suited to deal with her case , is apt to find that her appendix is indeed removed , but that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more colds , but that her heart is behaving strangely ; that she has reduced pounds and pounds , but that she can not digest her food . The family doctor , through his own wide acquaintance and experience , is able to give her sound advice as to which specialist to consult . The best specialists welcome , rather than discourage , the light which the family doctor can shed upon a case . And when the specialist has finished his work , the family doctor can resume his , to the profit and benefit of all concerned . Having been cured , we face a situation which is in itself a serious one . We are well , perfectly well , but we have had such a bad scare , we have suffered so much , that it is hard for us'to get the perspective and habit of health . ; ' . It 1 has been necessary , for a time , that we sho ild have a great deal of rest . This is now no longer - necessary . But we have allowed ours selves to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfluous afternoon nap. ; we dampen its enthusiasm for an evening 's outing because we imagine we-are dependent on an early bedtime . Or it has been necessary for a time for us to go on a special diet ; this is now no longer necessary . But we cling to our broths and blanc-manges , and expect our family either to share these , or to sympathize with us because we can not partake of their juicy steaks and succulent pies . Or we succumb to a sharp attack ofbronchitis , and it is necessary that we should be surrounded by a warm and even temperature . This is now no longer necessary ; but we continue to regard drafts as more menacing than Bengal tigers , and effectually deprive our husbands of the fresh air for which they long. , In short , we make ourselves and every one around us @#  | miserable , and before long we have made ourselves and every one around us ill . For the normal life is essentially not the life of special rest and special diet and special air . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose ; of balanced , hearty meals ; of wind and rain as well as sunshine and stillness . And the normal life is the only kind of life on which the average man or woman can permanently thrive . We need to remember to forget ? contradictory as this may sound ? our physical condition , when there is nothing the matter with it . We need to do this with regard to ourselves ; and we need to do it far more with regard to our children about whom we are apt to be unduly panicky , especially if they have once been ill , or even if their brothers and sisters have been ill . When my two elder boys had the whoopingcough ( and they contracted it , let me say in passing , when we were living on the farm , and had not been anywhere or seen anybodywhich ought to be a comfort to mothers who are forced to live in the city , and who feel that if they could only get their children to the nice clean country , they would never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known complication . For months we battled not only with whooping-cough , but with bronchial pneumonia , hemorrhages , and other difficulties . Years later , when our doctor told me that my third son ( who had not yet arrived upon the scene at the time his brothers put in that summer campaign ) had whooping-cough , I felt that I might as well prepare to lose him then and there . It was winter time , we were in Washington , and he was a far more delicate child than the others had been . I shut myself up in my room and gave way to violent hysteria . What actually followed was this : the child never lost a meal nor spent a day in bed ; once or twice a day he coughed hard , grew red in the face , whooped , and recovered himself . He played quite contentedly in a vacant lot next to our house ; and the fact that he had no other children to play with made him more dependent upon me for company than he had ever been before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all there was to it . We have always been told not to count our chickens before they are hatched . It is too bad we are not more often reminded that we do not need to bury our children until they are dead . Try to Assume Health So I think it is even more important to health that we assume we are well until we have been proved sick , than that a prisoner at the bar should be assumed to be innocent until he has been proved guilty . And I shall go even further than this : I think there are times when , knowing we are not well , we should still assume that we are , and do whatever is necessary for us to do in order to " carry on . " In saying this I do not take back a word I have said as to the value of preparedness and prevention , or about cooperation with our doctors . But I do mean that there come times in every woman 's life ( as there do in every man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing the fact that it is steep , still decide that the game is worth the candle and go ahead . If she does this , she has no right to blame either the doctor or the Deity-to repeat a phrase I have already used ? for the consequences . She alone is to blame if they prove grave , and must be prepared to accept them . Neither has she the right to assume the airs of a martyr or claim the reward of a saint as the result of her choice . After all , she makes it herself ; makes it with an object in view which she believes justifies the risk she is taking . And , strangely enough , usually she can " get away with the goods . " She can not only live to tell 1 the tale , but be none the worse for it permanently . The chronic invalid is seldom the cub reporter who sees her first chance for a " scoop " on the same day when she comes down with acute tonsillitis , and still lands her story on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient who is raving with a loathsome contagious disease ; or the mail-carrier riding her horse through a Rocky Mountain blizzard ; ' or the telephone operator who sits at her switch sending out signals of warning while the flood tides rise around her ; or the teacher who sees the last child out of the schoolhouse before she puts herself beyond the reach of the tongues of fire that are devouring it ; or the mother . who goes through the pangs of travail that " a man may be born into the world . " Women have died doing these things , it is true ; but I doubt whether any of those who have so died have felt that death had any sting or the grave any victory ; and most of them have lived to lead a fuller and happier life than they ever had before . " He either fears his fate too much , Or his desert too small , Who dares not put it to the touch , To win or lose it all . " " But most of us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ? yes , actually be the better afterward for having so risen , physically and otherwise . That has nothing to do with going under ' as the result of constant , daily strain , of finding that life is too hard all along the way , and surrendering in physical defeat . " I wonder ? ? Now that I am approaching middle-age ? with satisfaction , as I said before ? I look about me and discover many startling things . I notice , for instance , that nearly all the women among my contemporaries who have not had children , who have never been " isolated , " or lost their sleep , or worried or suffered , not only look about ten years older than those of us who have labored under all of these handicaps , but are physically not half so fit ! I do not attempt to explain it . I have never read or heard any account of childbirth which I thought began to describe its horrors . I know of nothing more ceaselessly wearing than the care of little children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agonizing as the danger of losing them when they are ill . And yet , it seems that if we cheat nature and refuse to face motherhood , she takes her own revenge . Success Does Not Demand Health I notice , too , that the great majority of worth-while things which are done in this world seem to be done by persons who are not in perfect health . I do not need to search history for this , to remind myself that Milton was blind , Scott lame , Beethoven deaf , and Stevenson a consumptive ; that Julius CTsar and Napoleon Bonaparte strove against chronic disease harder than they ever strove against their enemies on the field ; that Elizabeth Barrett rose from an invalid 's couch to elope with 1 Robert Browning ? and in spite of her ill health bore him a son . I see it all around me , all the time . I hear over and over again the cry John Paul Jones raised above the wreckage of the Bonhomme Richard , " I have not yet begun to fight ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite which was a stumbling block to the weak was a stepping-stone to the strong . The granite rock of sickness has obstructed the road of life for some women , but others have found their arms the stronger for having been forced to clear their paths of it . The woman who refuses to acknowledge that her body can permanently triumph over her spirit has gone a long way toward making body and spirit alike indomitable . And if , after all , sickness does come ? what of it ? I have spoken , because I saw it was necessary to do so in order to convince you that there has been no rift in our friendship , of some of the physical difficulties which beset me in the course of my trip around the world . But how often do you suppose I think of them in connection with that great adventure ? So seldom that the number of times is negligible . What I do think of ? every day , many times a day ? is that a great magazine did me the honor @#  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among many people ; that all those places were beautiful , that all those people were kind to me ; and that I came safely home again , having accomplished what I set out to do . Can a lame back rob me of the memory of the Malecon at dawn , and Hong Kong harbor at sunset , and the full moon hanging over the Pyramids ? Can it lessen the satisfaction of having gone up the river to Canton at a time when it was " impossible " for foreigners to do this ? Can it obliterate the indelible impression made upon me by the electric personality of Mussolini ? Of course , it can not . Lame back or no lame back , I feel that world-experience has been worth while , full measure , pressed down , running over . In proof of which ? to let you into a wonderful secret ? without even waiting for the old back to get wholly well , I am about to start off on another trip , and expect to find more wonderful things than ever of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowledge , of some of the hardships of maternity , in the endeavor to make a point which I was trying to stress . But how often do you suppose I think of those ? I or any other mother ? I think ? as other mothers do ? of a small , rosy body , firmly held by my supporting arms , splashing about in warm , deep water every morning . I think of a drowsy , curly , little head pressed close against my shoulder every evening . Of woolly lambs , and alphabet blocks ; of picture books and slumber songs and prayers ; of little dresses that I feather-stitched myself ; of stumbling , funny sentences that made me laugh , and funny , stumbling steps that had to be guided ; of worsted work , and dingy report cards marked " excellent , " fished from a pocket which contained a jack-knife , string , matches , fishhooks , and chewing-gum as well ; of homework with a rabbit leaping so far and a dog leaping so far ? and could I help decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of confidences given and received ; of sports and sorrows and splendors shared ; of lighted birthday cakes and lighted Christmas trees ; of a silver cup awarded for " best all-round efficiency " at camp , and a Harvard diploma ; of a ship 's rail with three boyish figures standing beside me , starting out to see the glories of earth ; of an altar rail with three boyish figures kneeling beside me , starting out to see the glories of heaven . Worth while , immeasurably worth while , was that wonderful adventure of a trip around the world ; but infinitely more worth while that far more wonderful adventure in motherhood . The greatest moment of my life was not when I " stood silent upon a peak in Darien " ; it was when I held my first-born in my arms and looked into his face . For the Permanent Invalid I have spoken , you may with reason remind me , only of the sicknesses from which we recover , which are at most intermittent ? interruptions of health , but nothing worse than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which there can be no recovery ? What of the woman who must spend the rest of her life in bed or in an invalid 's chair ! What of the constant sufferer ? I have said and I say again ? and I believe almost any physician will bear me out in saying it ? that there are comparatively few entirely hopeless illnesses , and that there would be fewer still if the invalids themselves were not hopeless . However , there are some . All of us do not die of sudden accident or old age . Some women do seem destined to years of pain before the blessed release comes at last . But strangely enough ? or so it may seem to the person with an unreasoning dread of illness in all its forms ? these persons are often happy themselves , and contribute in no slight measure to the happiness of those around them . I have in mind the case of the mother of two friends of mine , who , at middle age , became the victim of an unusually painful form of rheumatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She  | had been a very active woman , not only about her home , in which she was a model housekeeper ? I visited her frequently from childhood ? but in other ways as well ? a " good mixer . " fond of dancing and other amusements , an indefatigable traveler . After the first winter that she was confined to the house , she confided in me that she did not know when she had enjoyed a season so much . " So many pleasant persons ? like yourself , my dear ! ? coming and going . So much time for bridge ? I 've always loved the game , but I 've been rushing around too much to master it before . Now I 'm really an expert at it ! Such wonderful opportunities to catch up with all the latest novels ! " The next time I saw her , she was limited to a wheel-chair , but she was still firmly convinced that she was the most fortunate of mortals . " This room , Frances , is n't it attractive ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why , I can see everything that 's going on , right from my window ! No need to exert myself at all , and still all the fun ? and then it 's so comfortable in itself . Do take that rocker ; I 'm sure you 'll like it . " And so on through the years . Many years . Twenty years . At last she was only a crumpled little shadow , lying on her back , her pathetic , shrunken , waxen hands , utterly useless , supported by a pillow . She could not turn her head to look at me when I approached her bed . But after I was seated beside her , she smiled gaily . " Just back from another trip , are you ? Goodness , you 're getting to be a regular wandering Christian ! Now , listen to me : I 've traveled , too , so I 'm in a position to make a comparison . There 's nothing in it , compared to the satisfaction of a quiet life . Like mine , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented as I am ! " " Mother was not made of the same clay as most of us , " her daughter wrote me after this invalid of more than twenty years died ; and ? perhaps because clay is molded into such beautiful forms ? a verse I have always loved leaped to my mind : " You may break , you may shatter , the vase if you will , - But the scent of the roses remains with us still " . . . Dear Clare , I do feel that you 're going to get well ? very soon now . But even if you should n't , I know you will somehow find happiness just the same . Always yours with much love , Frances Parkinson Keyes
