Two mornings after the day before , the Man with the Brown Derby received newsgatherers again . He dictated a farewell message : <P> " I certainly do not expect ever to run for public office again . I have had all I can stand of it . I have given a quarter of a century of probably the best years of my life to it . I will never lose my interest in public affairs , that is a sure thing . But as far as running for office again is concerned-that 's finished . " <P> He rephrased it later : " My decision never again to run is unalterable . I said I was through , and I am through , with public life . I intend to take a rest and then devote the rest of my life to my family and my friends . " <P> Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the man who now seemed to become , automatically , the national Democracy 's most potent figure ( see p. 12 ) , said : " Get a rest , now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York State ready to turn over to his friend , replied : <P> " Well , I may see you in Georgia . I ca n't tell where I 'll be . . I 'm just going around in the car , wherever I feel like . " <P> " The car , " of course , was the St. Nicholas , private railroad home of Friend William F. Kenny . The St. Nicholas rolled up to Albany . <P> For a moment it seemed that this last scene would be too much for him . Ragged banners still flew in Albany , their legends , " Smith for President , " mocked and cancelled by wind and sleet . Yet the Albanians were out to meet him in cheering , bomb-bursting thousands . Mayor John Boyd Thacher insisted on taking his arm through the crush , just as on triumphal occasions when the Brown Derby used to return as Governor-re-elect . Now he was President-reject . <P> " Al , Al , Al , we 're still with you , " the people were shouting . A note of compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharper cry than ever before . The Brown Derby waved as of old , but the old smile somehow did not come . The lips were compressed . They were trembling . <P> Despite the storm , the grounds around the Executive Mansion were just as full as on that mid-summer night of nomination . <P> " ... No man ever lived who held so high a place in the affection of the people of this city , " Mayor Thacher said , for them . <P> " . . . It just fills me right up , " replied the Man with the Brown Derby . In a choked voice he promised to come back , often . <P> That was the last of it-until he leaves the Governorship on Jan. 1 . He took satisfaction from his popular vote . " There 's only one man in this country who got more votes for the Presidency than I did this year . " <P> A newsgatherer " bit " and asked : " Who 's that , Governor ? " <P> " Herbert Hoover . " <P> Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the Harding and Coolidge totals of 16,152,200 and 15,725,016 , respectively . But Smith received 5,479,450 more than any Democrat had ever received and there were other things to feel good about . <P> The Albany reception- " It 's natural enough to greet the victor , but when you greet the vanquished , that is different . " <P> Moving from Albany- " It 's just like getting married all over again , what with having to buy furniture and everything . "
