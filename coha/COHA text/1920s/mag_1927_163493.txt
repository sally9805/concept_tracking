THE BEGINNERS-Henry Kitchell Webster-Bobbs-Merrill ( $2.50 ) . Edward Patterson , 45 , married , father of Edith and Edward , suddenly breaks with a frantic gesture out of the insurance business by means of which he has been supporting his family in good style . Eagerness for variety makes him go so far as to try to sell a mechanical device for automobiles . Poor returns on this venture make it necessary for his daughter to leave school , his son to work through college . Edward Patterson gives up . He makes amends to his wife who resents his incipient affair with Ruth Ingraham , returns to insurance selling and normality . The result of this is a novel that proves little . Nevertheless , handicapped by the mediocrity of his theme , Author Webster , who as a novelist is no beginner , achieves a story which is characteristically well-built and worth reading .
