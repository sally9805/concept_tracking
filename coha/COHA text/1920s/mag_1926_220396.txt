Last week the fond fathers of many bills who had hoped or professed to hope until now that this session of Congress would adopt their offspring began to admit to this or that Washington correspondent that nothing was to be expected . <P> But before numbering those lost by the wayside it is worthwhile to note the sturdy offspring who achieved preferment , the important measures that were passed : <P> Tax Reduction . When the House assembled last December , a tax reduction bill fresh from the hands of the Ways and Means Committee was waiting for it . Before Christmas , the House had passed it , by the middle of February the Senate too had stamped it with approval , and the bill reducing surtaxes and estate taxes to a maximum of 20% , shaving down the maximum normal tax and increasing personal exemptions became law . Such was one of the first , one of the greatest accomplishments . <P> World Court . Before the Senate reached the tax bill , however , it had to dispose of a proposal , pending for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Court with reservations . The struggle by a minority opposition was bitter and concluded with a ten days ' filibuster and the application of cloture to end debate . The U. S. adhered , 76 to 17 . <P> Debt Funding Agreements . The bitterest struggle in House and Senate was over the Italian agreement which provided for only about 25% repayment ( of the present value ) . But the argument that Italy could pay no more carried the day . The Senate finally gave its consent ( TIME , May 3 ) and agreements with Belgium , Czechoslovakia , Roumania , Esthonia and Latvia followed in quick succession ( TIME , May 10 ) . <P> Appropriations . Meanwhile Congress had been grinding the unimpressive but all important grist of appropriations which will keep the Government functioning to June 30 , 1927 . <P> Railroad Labor . A new means of solving railway-labor disputes by mediation and arbitration had been worked out by railway executives and labor leaders , was embodied in a bill and was sent forth as a full-fledged law by the middle of May-a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little satisfaction to anyone . <P> Aeronautics . Three bills were passed-growing in large measure out of the to-do over aviation started by Colonel William Mitchell last fall-one gave the Department of Commerce supervision over civil aviation , the other two provided five year building programs for the air arm of Army and Navy . The Departments of Commerce , War , Navy will each have an Assistant Secretary in charge of aviation .
