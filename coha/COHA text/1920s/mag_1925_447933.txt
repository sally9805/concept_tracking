THE ceremony of the Snake Dance begins many days before that public conclusion the tourist sees . The date of the dance is announced by the pueblo crier from the housetops . The priests of the Antelope and Snake clans go to their respective kivas where , amid chants and exorcism , the wardrobe is looked over and all necessary tools and sacred equipment are prepared . A certain number of songs are sung each day , according to a strict ritual . It is during this time that new members are initiated , whether or not with revolting rites is for those to answer who know . Then comes the snake-hunt , occupying four days , each day to a different point of the compass , north , west , south , and east . One would think that snakes have fixed and respected neighborhoods , so readily do the hunters procure them ; and one monster bull-snake , fully seven feet long and proportionately thick , must be trained by the Second Mesa devotees , for it always occupies the centre of the stage at Machongnovi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This facility in procuring snakes caused me to ask a young Hopi how they were located . ' By tracking , ' he answered , pointing to the dusty sand at our feet . ' See ! There is a snake 's track . We can follow him home and dig him out , if you want . ' Well , we did n't do it , because I had 188 something less dangerous on hand ; and I must confess that I could not discern the delicate trail of the snake he referred to . But then , too , I have followed Indian trackers as they sought to run down a man . They would call off his movements as if reading from a book . As a desert tracker , I was a good Indian Agent . Armed with a hoe , for excavating the more retiring , with a buckskin sack of sacred meal , ? for this must be sprinkled on the votaries , ? a larger bag in which to carry them , and a snake-whip of feathers , the hunters go forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the snake family , such as a bull snake , no matter his size , is simply picked up with slight ceremonial fuss . But the rattlesnake often objects . He is most likely to sound his displeasure , and to coil swiftly for defense . Perhaps he has never attended a Snake Dance . In this event , the hunter blesses him with meal and proceeds to attract his attention with caresses of the snake-whip . After several strokes of the long eagle feathers , the snake uncoils and seeks escape ; but swifter than he is the unerring hand that nips him just back of the head . He is waved in the air , stroked with a quick pressure along his spine , and dropped into the sack with the others . And no more attention is paid to the sack 's contents when carrying it back to the kiva than if it contained so much corn . Here they come ! ' calls the ever-present small boy , who perches perilously on a projecting house-pole . Quietly , ceremoniously , the Antelope priests in single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with slow measured steps they march about the stage four times . When passing the kisi , each man stamps with his right foot on the board that shelters the snakes . They sprinkle meal . And they are followed by the guardian of the Bull-roarer , a tall man who carries a huge Indian bow ornamented with feathers , and who stops in mid-stage to sound his awesome instrument . With all the force of his arm he whirls that wooden plumb-bob on a sinew string . It moans with the wind voice of the Desert . Then the Antelope men form a straight line with the kisi , their backs to the houses and their faces to the plaza . Now sounds a hurried noise , much clatter and scuffling , as the Snake priests approach . They burst into the plaza as if determinedly answering a call to battle . They are headed by the most robust of the clan , large powerful men . With rigid faces , fixedly staring , their elbows set as runners , they stride down the plaza . The crowd massed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Snake priests must go to the farthest end of this shelf on their first round , after which they shorten each lap until four have been completed . The crowd must fall back . It has no license to be there at all , and there is nothing in Snake-clan etiquette signifying change because curiosity has come out of the East . Their rushing single file of men is projected straight at the narrow end of the shelf . Finding that it was impossible to fix such a throng in place , would station two guards at that point to warn and part the spectators . Just what would happen if the whites did not yield is deleted material plaza is a fighting rattlesnake , a vicious coiled spring , fangs darting , restless , angry . The dancers avoid it . The crowd shrills its approval of the scene . But the gatherer is watching . Soon the snake gives a quick wriggle and is off , darting for the mesa edge , and those forming the crowd there begin anxiously to shift their feet . Another second and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake from under the very toes of the spectators . lie waves it through the air in the motion of his capture , strokes it into limpness as he watches his dancers . Then it dangles from his left hand , and he proceeds to the next adventure . Meantime , other couples have approached the kisi and have produced their snakes . The differences in reptiles now attract attention . There are long , thin , nervous snakes , and short , fat , sluggish ones . A shout of amazement goes up when a very large specimen of bull snake is seen , its tail almost trailing the earth . But varying snakes do not affect the priests . The Antelope men continue the whirring of their gourds , and with the Snake men the action becomes faster . Seven or eight couples are now stamping around , and the gatherers have a busy time of it . And then comes the signal that the bag of the kisi is empty . All snakes have been produced in the open , and danced with , and dropped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large circle on the ground before the Dance Rock . The dancers approach and throw all the snakes into this circle . They crowd around it as meal is sprinkled , and perhaps some exorcism is muttered . For a second they poise there , as if under a spell ; and then certain appointed men thrust ' their hands into the squirming mass , catch up as many snakes as possible , and rush from the plaza to liberate the votaries in the far Desert . This distribution of the snake messengers ends what one may term the intriguing features of the ceremony . Soon the panting runners return to engage in the so-called purification ' rites , the taking of the emetic ; and a number of the curious follow them to be in at the death . It is not of importance that one should witness this part of the programme ; it is simply a matter of taste . Physicians may wish to time the potency of desert brews . The priests are then washed from head to foot by the women of the clan . Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priests disappear into their kiva . Soon the women are hurry- . ing there too , bearing in trays all sorts of viands . The dancers , who have fasted , would absorb a bit of nourishment . God knows they have earned it ! Dr. Jesse Walter Fewkes , the celebrated ethnologist , writes that after the Snake Dance of 1883 two of the liberated snakes were caught and taken to the National Museum at Washington for examination . He states that their fangs and poison-sacs were found to be intact . He does not accept the belief that these Hopi Indians have an antidote for the poison of rattlesnakes . It is his view that the desert rattler can inflict a deadly bite only after coiling and lunging viciously on its victim . And there is little to the theory that the snakes have been drugged or dulled into lethargy , since I have many times seen the rattlesnakes coil and fight wickedly . Several persons , particularly Mr. Herbert F. Robinson , the Government Engineer for the Navajo and Hopi country , claim to have seen Snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a statement . But it is possible that the paint with which the priests are so liberally daubed has , for snakes , a repugnant odor ; and having anointed their hands and arms , and especially their mouths , faces , and necks with this ointment , they secure a certain immunity . And the stroking of the snakes , when picked up , may explain the safety of the gatherer . This action no doubt produces a partial paralysis of the snake 's muscular system . But this does not answer for those who thrust bare hands and arms into the snake bag at the kisi . If one must see a Snake Dance , the best show is at Walpi in years of odd numbers . The ceremony is held also at Machongnovi , Chimopovi , and Hotevilla . Since 1918 there has been no dance at Oraibi , perhaps because of factional disputes , although a disciple of Christianity has claimed part of the credit . There is a solemnity observed at Hotevilla , among the reactionaries , with prophet Youkeoma , the second man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walpi preserve more of Indian color and thrill of action in their performance . Perhaps they have realized the advantage of a good show , well staged and costumed and vigorously enacted . While they do not invite the tourists , they keep them coming , and business in Snake Dance week is brisk along all lines . Not all of the Hopi people are members of the Snake clan . Those of the uninitiated are as diffident with rattlesnakes as the rest of us . This lodge has difficulty in keeping up its membership . Sometimes a Hopi is invited to join , or is ordered to report for duty in the Snake kiva , and he declines this honor . It is hell for him to remain away from dances thereafter , or he may have to hold a punishment snake as a penalty . It was through III the courtesy of Mr. John Lorenzo Hubbell , that early pioneer and baronial trader of the Navajo Desert , that I chanced to view the most secret of the Snake Dance rites , the baptism or washing of the snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the public ceremony . Perhaps one might call it the consecration of the messengers ; for , as I have understood it , the snakes are the tribe 's envoys to the gods , bearing its petition for rain and its thanks for harvests . Perhaps , as Moungwi , I might have achieved this success earlier , but it was my method in dealing with the Hopi , an always suspicious people , not to display an interest in their secrecies . Of necessity ? or perhaps I should say in good judgment ? I had to police their dances , to prevent possible clashes between the nonunderstanding Indian and the nearly always unreasonable and overcurious tourist ; but I have never asked an Indian , anywhere , to give me an ' inside ' concerning his primitive beliefs . Having to guide and often to judge that same Indian , it would have been an unfair advantage to take of my position , and would at once have classed me , the appointed mentor , as a piece of curiosity no different from the white men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other means of acquiring information . The traders told me all they had garnered through the many years of trafficking with Indians , and each newcomer ? tourist , artist , or itinerant official ? presented me with the varying chaff of his very swift and gullible gleaning . The always helpful Mr. Hubbell bridged this dilemma by inviting me as his guest , and I could accept without losing caste . Hubbell had been admitted to the kiva many years before ; then Dr. Fewkes in 1899 , as he relates ; and since then the Indians have received Mr. Roosevelt , General Hugh L. Scott , and a few others . Perhaps not more than a score of white men have witnessed this ceremony . In our little party were a visiting superintendent , an engineer of the Desert Service , and Mr. Ford Harvey , son of the immortal Fred who rescued so many hungry travelers along the Santa Fe , and to whom should be erected a monument of bronze . From the poles of the kiva ladder flew the feather-plumes that signify the progress of secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we filed after him down the ladder into the cool , dim atmosphere of that underground rock-walled vault . It had a peculiar odor ? perhaps an earthy , perhaps a snaky , smell . Kivas usually are empty places . Bare and cold , unless filled with eye-stinging smoke from firebrands , I had not found them inviting on my rounds of the mesas . I had held councils in them when making the first steps against factional religious persecution . Again I had sat in them , chatting with the makers of costumes and drums , smoking their bitter and powerful tobacco , and afterward wishing sincerely I had not . Most often the kiva is the club for retired old men of the tribe , lonely , feeble fellows , where they curl up to drowse and sleep , or where they weave some ceremonial scarf . It is not good form to idle in the neighborhood of kivas when the feather-plumes are displayed . The ladder ended on a stone platform , raised above the main kiva-floor . In the corners of this platform stood large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the corners and about the jars were snakes . Not just a few snakes that had wandered out of their pottery containers , but congested wads of snakes , piled carelessly in the corners of the kiva , and with nothing to prevent their leaving when the spirit moved them . However , they were quiet , somnolent , save for beady eyes and for an occasional slithery movement that caused one to watch his step . VOL. 136 ? NO. 11 At the upper end of the kiva was an elaborate sand-painting after the fashion of the Navajo , no doubt another adoption , of foreign origin . A sand-painting is a mosaic-like picture of Indian symbols and fetishes , worked out in colored sands . This was surrounded or fenced by peeled wands , placed close together on end . And at this ceremonial altar stood , practically nude , two of my schoolboys , bronzed lads of about sixteen , who had taken part that morning in the sunrise race . Under the ladder and on the main floor a number of older Indians were grouped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other liquids . And these priests were arrayed for ceremony . The sacred-meal pouches were in evidence . Soon a chant was intoned . The Hopi chants are primitive , but have in them an echo of Catholic litanies . I have seen a Hopi priest anoint with and toss the sacred meal just as his forbears saw the padres bless the people . The Hopi is an assiduous adapter . And while listening to the chanting I have often expected to catch the refrain : ' Ora pro nobis . ' The padres were sacrificed to the desert gods in that red revolt of 1680 , but their peaches dry each season on the pueblo housetops , and Hopi ceremonies carry an unconscious echo of the black-robes who taught the solemnity of ritual . Around the walls of the kiva , at the height of one 's head , were wooden pegs set in the stone , and draped over these were masks and costumes . As my position at the end of the platform brought me close to one of these bundles , I leaned against it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nearest snakes of my corner , and another eye to the proceedings of the elders . A snake wriggled out from the pile and came closer ; but the Indian who had received us waved him back with a feather-whip . Someone was watching that sector , and I grew more confident . We stood there for a little time in silence . From above came the noises of the crowd , thronging through the village streets . One could look up through the square opening of the entrance and see the blue Arizona sky . The ladder was very comforting . Several of the guests sat down on the edge of the platform , but I did not . I leaned comfortably against my pile of regalia , and kept a wide-angled view of the whole interior . Then one of the Indians crossed the platform , gathered a few snakes , and passed them swiftly to the old men at the bowls . They uttered invocations , stretched the snakes out , and anointed them with meal , all the while chanting in a low tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , carrying rattles and insignia . They too began a chant . And then suddenly the old men plunged the snakes into the water of the bowls ? a quick , unceremonious ducking , the choir raising its chant to a savage crescendo . It was no longer rhythmic and solemn . It was like a scream of death , a wild , unreasoning challenge that ended in a blood-curdling shriek ; and at that final cry the snakes were hurled up the kiva , to fall on the sand-painting . The peeled wands were knocked over by their swirling bodies . Somnolent before , the snakes now waked up and twisted about , seeking escape , their heads raised , their tongues darting in and out . A hissing and whirring sounded . Their movements in the sand caused the design to be obliterated . Now came another handful of snakes , swiftly passed for the baptism , and again the low chanting , but faster now , faster , and always that wild ending of the chant , and the throwing of the reptiles . More and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were down now . And in among the snakes , with a calmness that chilled the blood , walked my two schoolboys , nude as Adam , hustling back to the sand those that darted for the walls . Twice snakes reached the stone bench along the kiva 's end and , climbing it , sought crevices of the upper wall . Each time a boy reached for the disappearing truant and nonchalantly dragged him back to his place in this wildest of pagan rites . Finally all the snakes had been removed from our corners , and several inches of them made a moving carpet where had been the mosaic . There came a pause , a significant cessation of action , as if the priests had reached an unexpected , unforeseen part of the service . There was a quick consultation among the headmen . One of the boys , Edward , began looking around . He went to the nearest peg and removed some of the costumes , dropping a mask to the floor . He examined the mask . Then he went to another peg and performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , at the end of the platform . ' What is it , Edward ? ' I asked him . ' We had sixty-five rattlesnakes , Mr. Crane , ' he replied stolidly , ' and now we count but sixty-four . Let me look through those dresses you are leaning against . That other one may be ? ' ' Excuse me , ' I said hurriedly , as I went up the ladder . IV Of course all Indians should not be forced into the same mould . Let us try to give each his chance to develop what is best in him . Moreover , let us be wary of interfering overmuch with either his work or his play . It is mere tyranny , for instance , to stop all Indian dances . Some which are obscene or dangerous must be prohibited . Others should be permitted , and many of them encouraged . Nothing that tells for the joy of life , in any community , should be lightly touched . ? ROOSEVELT , A Booklover 's Holidays When I first read this , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian dances and ceremonies I had witnessed : the Butterfly , Basket , and Corn dances , the Snake and Flute dances of the Hopi ; the Medicine Sings , and squaw dances , and the Ye-be-chai of the Navajo ; the colorful pageants of the Pueblos , after Catholic Mass is celebrated on the name-days of their patron saints and the fiesta begins ; the memorial ceremony of the Mohave , and their cremation of the dead . And those slam-bang , whirlwind dances of the Sioux . Some of these were commemorative ; some were fixed ceremonials ; some were of little moment and some seemed nothing more serious than masquerades ; some were filled with superstition and load just a touch of smouldering fanaticism under the veneer of paint and feathers . A few were social gatherings , a break in the monotony of existence , having in them ' the joy of life . ' And , while all of the native dances should have thrown around them a thin line of supervision and restraint , many of them should by no means be lightly touched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly revolting at first sight . And perhaps it should be prohibited . That is a point of view . I am not thoroughly convinced of its danger to Indians , since I never heard of a Hopi dying from snake-bite . I saw so many Snake Dances that the edge has been dulled from my original thrill . If tourists were denied the pleasure of seeing it , I believe the ceremony would soon languish , and pass away entirely with the going of the elders from the mesa stage . Certainly I sought to prevent its perpetuation through the initiation of children , but without result , for I was unsupported in this , and alone I feared my inability to stifle a pagan war . But of those things that should be dealt with gently , the tiny shows that the vacationist seldom sees and the Bureau has never heard of , I recall the Dance of the Dolls . One afternoon , at First Mesa , I came along a trail toward the witch 's camp , meaning to start for home once the team was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my interpreter , who said : ? ' He wants you to stay and see the Dolls ' Dance . ' Now I had quite a collection of Hopi dolls , those quaint figurines carved with some skill from pieces of cottonwood , and dressed in the regalia of twig and feather and fur to represent the various kachinas of the clans . But I had never heard of a dance devoted to these little mannequins . What sort of dance is that ? ' I asked . It is called the Dolls-Grind-Corn Dance , ' he replied . When ? to-morrow ? ' thinking of those monotonous open-air drills , having various names but scarcely to be distinguished one from the other . No . To-night , in the kiva . ' This interested me . I could see that the interpreter longed to remain overnight among his people , and to take in this show . Well , ' I said , ' is it worth climbing that mesa in the dark ? ' I think you would like it , ' he answered ; ' it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . ' So I did not order up the team . After supper , when the twilight had faded into that clouded blackness before the stars appear , I scrambled after my guide up the mesa trail . When we reached the end of that panting climb , the houses of the people were murkily lighted by their oil lamps , but most of the householders were abroad , going toward the various kivas . To the central one we went , and clown the ladder . The place was lighted by large swinging lamps , borrowed for the occasion from the trader , lamps that have wide tin shades and may be quickly turned to brilliancy or darkness by a little wheel at the side . I had expected to find it a gloomy place , whereas they had arranged something very like the lighting of a theatre . It was a trifle difficult to find a place in that crowded vault . The far end was kept clear , but the two long sides and the ladder end were packed with Hopi women and their little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children could scarcely repress their nervous interest , now sitting , now standing on tiptoe , turning and watching , as if this would hasten matters . I seated myself on a lower rung of the ladder , believing this place would be most desirable from my point of view , because from it I had a view of the kiva 's centre and could most easily make my way to the upper air when things became too thick . A crowded kiva is rather foreign in atmosphere when filled to its capacity and with lamps going . But I soon found that I should be disturbed . From above came the noise of rattles and the clank of equipment , calls and the shuffling of feet . A line of dancers descended upon me . I moved to let them pass into the lighted centre-space . They were garbed in all the color and design of Hopi imagination , and wore grotesque masks . They lined up , and I sensed that their mission was one of merrymaking . Two clowns headed the band , and soon had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on a rapid dialogue . There was a great deal of laughter . I had my usual experience in trying to gain a knowledge of the show through an interpreter , quite the same as that lady who accompanied an attach ? to hear a speech by Bismarck in the Reichstag . You will remember that the visitor kept demanding interpretation , whereas the attach ? remained silent , intently listening , as the Iron Chancellor droned on , monotonously voluble . ' What does he say ? ' asked the visitor for the fifth time . Madam , ' replied the attach ? , ' I am waiting for the verb ! ' And that is about as far as I ever got toward exact knowledge of the clowns in any dance . I have tried it many times . The interpreter always enjoyed the show for himself first , and left me in outer darkness . Occasionally he would attempt to explain some part of the horseplay in progress , probably such simple portions as he thought my feeble intellect would rise to . ' You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the uncles ! ' And apparently there are always two , paternal and maternal , I suppose . The uncle is the great man of the Hopi family . The father does not amount to much ? he can be divorced in a jiffy and , while the mother is the household boss , she is always dominated by the grandmother , if living , and dictated to by the uncle in matters concerning alliances with other families . Perhaps one should call him a social arbiter . He has a great deal to say about weddings , marriage portions , and the like . Whenever I have watched the clowns at these smaller dances , and have asked their roles in the play , invariably they have been the uncles . Perhaps the Hopi in this manner square themselves at the expense of the family martinet . I could not see that there was anything to cause suspicion of evil in this little scene . In old Navajo dances the clowns would often engage in dialogue that interpreters feared to translate . This is the charge too against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clowns of the Hopi have been known to indulge in antics that were not elevating . I can not bring myself to believe , however , that the clowns of the Dolls ' Dance were relating anything other than crude witticisms , for the little children laughed as loudly as the others , and it seemed sheer fooling . Had a slapstick been in evidence , I should have been sure of the nature of the proceedings ; but the Indians have not developed exactly this form of humor . Then the dancers filed out , up the ladder , and away . They go to another kiva , ' said my companion . And almost immediately came another and different set of fun-makers . They took the centre of the kiva and soon had all laughing at similar jokes and grimaces . So , I thought , the old tiresome reel over again , to be continued throughout the night . For I had seen this dancing in relays last an entire day , stopping only for hasty meals and new costumes or make-up , and to one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense boredom . I arose , about to depart ; but my interpreter pulled me down . Wait ! Wait ! ' he urged . ' They will put out the lights ? ' This time the dancers did not leave the kiva . One of them came to the lamp just above me , and at a signal all the lights were dimmed . The kiva was in thick darkness . One could hear childish sighs of expectation . Perhaps the lights were off for thirty seconds , although it did not seem so long . Then they flared up , to reveal a curious little scene that had been constructed in the dark . I had not noticed that the dancers packed anything in with them . The setting may have been in that crowded kiva all the time ; but where had it been concealed ? At any rate , it was a queer little show , quite like that of our old friend Punch . There was a painted screen of several panels , and in the centre ones were two dolls , fashioned to represent Hopi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther extended on the floor before them and their stone tubs was a miniature cornfield ? the sand , and the furrows , and the hills of tiny plants . Hardly had the first sigh of pleased surprise from , the children died away , when , even to my astonishment , the dolls became animated , and with odd lifelike motions began to grind corn , just as the women grind daily in the houses of the villages , crushing the hard grain between the stone surfaces of the metate and the mano . These mannequins worked industriously , and with movements not at all mechanical . Then a little bird fluttered along the top of the screen , piping and whistling . Shrills of delight from the youngsters , to be followed by audible gasps , for from a side panel came twisting a long snake , to dart among the corn hills of the scenic field , and then to retreat backward through the hole from which it had appeared . These actions followed each other in quick succession . The fellow behind the screen was quite skillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe . Perhaps in all this there was some deep-laid symbolism , checking rigidly with the North Star and the corn harvests of the past and future . Perhaps it was a primitive object-lesson , to encourage thrift and industry as a bulwark against famine . But if you ask me , I saw in it exactly a repetition of the district schoolhouse or the country chapel at holiday time , when Cousin Elmer obliges with a droll exhibition of whiskers and sleighbells and cotton snowflakes . Sometimes the Hopi at these festivals for children give them presents too , and a handful of piki-bread bestowed by a clown , however bizarre his facial appearance , has all the gift-wonder of our childhood Santa Claus and his treasure-pack . Touch lightly ! They ? all children will be gone soon enough . A little while and you can rest from anemic policies and sophist sermons . The Desert will be lonely without its simple shepherds and their simple customs . Those who strain to inherit it , through legislation , will pack with them no poetry and attract no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimy oil-rigs , and yawning coal-drifts will mar the Desert . A few old books , a few paintings , ? their creators gone , too , ? will picture what you once possessed and experimented with and auctioned off . For one Shelton , discredited perhaps by a clamor of sanctimonious mediocrity , you have entrusted these people and their empire to twenty Bumbles . Twice you have sought to partition their community life , to make swift the end , to hasten the advent of the speculator who follows estates and bids for the possessions of the dead . At length , ? because at length you will succeed in selling the desert heritage , ? there will be only the museum case , and dust , and a ticket . V The Snake Dance ends very close to sunset . The crowds leave the mesa-top , down the trails afoot or mule-back , clown the rocky roads in rough wagons , a scrambling multitude . The sun is gilding the western walls of First Mesa , throwing the east-side roads and trails in shadow , and above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous halo . The farther eastern valley is bathed in a strange lemon light . The far-away northern capes gleam luminously in scarlet and gold , and then suddenly are gone . Huhkwat-we , the Terrace of the Winds , pales in lavender and grayish green . Twilight , with its mysterious desert hush , steals over Hopi-land . Something has been fulfilled in accordance with an ancient prophecy . The desert gods have been appeased . Soon it is dark , and stars appear as vesper candles . And then , all about the foot of the great fortresslike mesa , lighting the sand dunes and gleaming warmly through the peach trees , grow camp-fires . Where is usually a heavy silence at evening , broken only by sheep bells , now one hears laughter , many voices , the sound of the chef at work ; and the smell of cooking rises . Coffee and bacon , desert fare , spread their aroma , and a ravenous hunger comes to one . Here is a tiny group about a tented auto , there amid horses and harness and camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it ! ' I recall incidents of my introduction to these scenes . Armijo , the trader 's relative , had brought his treasured violin . I heard its tones from the trail and , when I came to Hubbell 's camp , there a group of them , musicians of the posts , were making ready to match their skill against the melody that tourists bring . Supper put away , the concert began . How do you like this ? ' asked the master of the bow and , as he swept the strings , that saddest of memory songs cried poignantly , a song fit for a desert night and a desert camp : ' La Golondrina . ' Such harmonies of double-stopping I had seldom heard . It seemed to me ? or was it desert magic ? ? that Kreisler could do no more . Silence . And then applause from fifty camps . And Ed 's guitar .

Night , under the old trees and in the shadow of the mesa of the gods , brings quite the romance of serenades ; and especially soothing after a long tiresome day . But ? a banjo ! That thumpety , plankety , plunkety thing ! I was sorry I had spoken . He would oblige with something to fit clogs and the levee , and the whole atmosphere of that evening would vanish , never to return ! The doctor opened a case . ' What would you like to hear ?

Then , softly through the grove , sounded the Melody in F , in organ tones . Of course you will perceive that I am no musician and no critic . I have not the ear of the one or the language of the other . I am simply one of those who like to hear what I like ? hopeless .

Down under the hill were camped a bunch of troubadours that once had trooped with a second company , passing as the Original New York Cast . By the light of a lantern they played accompaniments on an old melodeon , dragged from the schoolhouse . A rousing chorus , and then a tenor voice : the Irish Love Song . Followed a roar of applause that brought drowsy Indians to the mesa edge . Strange Americanos ! Strange Bohannas , who mock at drums and chanting , and who then make such queer music and many cries . And by midnight the fires would die down , one by one , to mere glows . The pueblo lights , high up along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps , only the sound of horses munching , the bray of a desert nightingale from the upper corrals , or the canter of a mounted policeman through the sand , as he gave a last look around before rolling in his blanket . Then silence under the dark star-strewn sky , a tranquil desert silence , to be broken perhaps ? who knows ? ? by ghostly sandals , as the padre walked to see that curious company , asleep in his onetime garden , guests of a pagan feast .
