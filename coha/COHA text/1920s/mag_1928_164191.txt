Tom Tom Tom Tom Sirs : <P> " The TOM of the tom-tom " ( TIME , current issue ) . The scrivener runs riot , tom-tomming all over his paragraph . Let a protest be noted . Peeping TOMS , TOMboys , Blind TOMS , TOM-tits , TOMcats , TOMcods , TOM turkeys , Long TOMS , the TOM of the tom-toms as words , should be axed . Why should a noble name be subject to veiled insult and subtle abuse ? Sir , in the game of Gleek the knave of trumps is called TOM ! An oyster 's liver is sneeringly called a TOMalley ! Why not Peter for the Peepers , Terry for the little girls who break windows and thumb their noses , Bert for the blind musicians of Dixie , Ted for the titmice , Timothy for the cats , Tobias for the Turkeys , Louis or Louie for the long guns ? And does n't everyone who has heard of tom-tom know that it does n't TOM at all , but wum-wum-wums ? TIME is too kindly , too wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give TOM a break , along with Richard and Henry ! <P> <P> TOM LENNON Oakland , Calif . <P> <P> Horrified , Disgusted Sirs : <P> <P> If you of TIME 'S press ever laid a claim to that virtue called completeness , relinquish it immediately ! I was shocked , horrified , nauseated , disgusted , not to say alarmed and surprised at a certain small but ever so noticeable " faux pas " in your issue of July 16 , where , on page 9 , col. i , under the heading " Bandwagon " ( O how it pains me to set this down ! ) you committed the horrible blunder of referring to Senator James Thomas ( Tom Tom ) Heflin - without ( terribly so ) the usual and customary appositional phrase which begins , " who mortally hates-etc . " <P> Please wake up ! That 's all I can say . <P> <P> DAVID MCDONELL <P> Washington , D. C. <P> <P> Subscriber McDonell proves that TIME readers have learned to supply the appositional phrase for themselves-hence it will in future be omitted. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In your issue of July 16 under the department caption PEOPLE- " Names make news " there is a paragraph headed Tallulah Bankhead , followed by an account of a man 's jumping from the liner Rochambeau into the Atlantic Ocean . In view of your avowed passion for accuracy may I point out the following errors in the account . <P> Miss Bankhead was not in any way connected with the story , nor was she mentioned at all in the United States by A. P. , Universal or United Press ; she is not red-headed but blonde ; she is not the daughter but granddaughter of the late U. S. Senator Bankhead ( Ala . D. ) . Whether she " was robbed for a moment of her gay and civilized exuberance " is problematical but doubtful . <P> The man did not jump at night but in broad daylight or he would n't be writing this ; the liner did not put out a lifeboat until the man had been sighted , nor would there , under any circumstances , be any point in so doing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is not Jeanne but Eugenia . Perhaps as you say " no one could guess why Morgan ( wrong again ) Hoyt should have wished to leave J:he bright ( ? ) ship , " etc. , but some of them seem to have made a pretty good job of trying . <P> MORTON HOYT Washington , D.
