Voice of the Ghetto <P> Eager , active , completely absorbed in a study of life , Fannie Hurst seems to me not only the intuitive portrayer of feminine emotion but also the hard-working literary craftsman . If you call on her in her apartment in Manhattan with its Italian furnishing and its soft lighting , with two tawny Pekinese saying how-do-you-do at your feet , if you see her there , a striking figure in a high-backed chair , her straight black hair drawn back stiffly from her forehead , you will perhaps not realize the keen , almost childlike qualities that her mind possesses . She understands life in its simplest moments . Complex tragedies unravel for her because she reduces them to the common denominator of primitive emotions . This quality , I believe , together with reportorial ability , must be the possession of every writer of great human appeal . Miss Hurst gathers her friends , and they are found to range from politicians to shop girls and poets . <P> Miss Hurst understands the American immigrant as do few other of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional equipment , partly because , though of foreign blood , she was born in America . With sympathy , she yet has a sense of perspective . With genius of the kind that develops quickly into success , she yet has the character to work every day with unflagging zeal . The infusion of racial differences has already had a great effect on the thought-stream of American literature , and it will have an increasing effect . Yet I believe that the greatness of our writing depends on the ability of these foreigners to build upon the foundation of English and American writing , of English and American character . Too many of them turn away quickly from what they believe to be a narrow puritanical ideal , and content themselves with a cheap imitation of European writing . This does not make for great writing . The closer to the soil a writer is , the greater is his work . You may bring to America the color , the passion , the luxuriousness of the Orient ; but unless this is laid out upon the rocks of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . David Pinski , who lives on New York 's East Side and writes in Yid- dish , can scarcely be called an American writer , although he has been in this country some years . It is from . a. combination of abilities , ideals , and emotions like that which Fannie Hurst commands that America will reap most fully the benefit of her . rich store of foreign . blood . I know of no one who has so great a chance to furnish us with the great story of American immigrant life .. So far , I do not believe that she has done it . Will she ? J. F.
