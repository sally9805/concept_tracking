txt MONOPOLY AND BRIDGES . A Protest Against Protection for 179th Street Project . The Executive Secretary of the Interstate Hudson River Bridge Association of New Jersey , in taking issue with Mr. Samuel Rea In respect to bridging the Hudson River , raises a controversy which clouds the issue , but does not enter into the merits of the case . If a bridge is to be built with private capital or credit it is essential , in the public interest , that there be no legislative enactment creating a monopoly for such private enterprise , such as is alleged to be included in Senate Bill 29 now pending before the legislature at Trenton . Any bridge suitably located with respect to the needs of the . States of New York and New Jersey should not need the pro-1 tection of legislative enactment of this character , and the mere fact that the ' promoters of the location at 179th Street feel the need of such may be taken as a confession that such location at present is illogical and economically unsound . The real issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1States of New York and New Jersey wish , by legislative enactment , to give I consent to agreements in respect to highway crossing over the - Hudson River for the entire meVopolitan district of New York north of Fortysecond Street and the State of New Jersey , which shall , in effect , create a monopoly for the life of the bonds to be issued  --  say the next fifty years ? and thereby during such period arbitrarily divert traffic from natural channels by forcing the use of facilities unsuitably located for the present , and possible future , needs of the districts to be served . Viewing- the present congestion of vehicular traffic , north and south bound , on Manhattan Island , picture what it will be before a bridge can be completed , and visualize what inconvenience and loss would result for say the next fifty years if one bridge only could be built to serve the needs of such a thickly settled territory .
