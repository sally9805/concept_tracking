WHEN Murphy of Tammany Hall died , everybody congratulated his shade on the fact that his estate was comparatively small . It seemed to refute the idea that politicians ever grafted . It is now discovered that a mistake was made , and the estate is four times as big as was supposed . Mediums report that the Murphy shade is slightly paler . SOME weeks ago we said as definitely as we knew how , that the Elevated ought to be done away with . Now they have a wreck . Our sympathy for the victims is mixed with regret that while it was killing people the entire structure did n't quietly fall down . NEXT to the Forty-second Street shuttle , the calendar is obviously the most inconvenient thing existing .

We had said that we only awaited the arrival of our ship before moving in . Tuesday , however , we saw one Rolls Royce and one HispanoSuiza standing in the courtyard , chauffeurs idly chatting , which arouses the suspicion that we may need two ships . THE Pennsylvania Railroad , while doubtless in some ways admirable , offers those who wish to meet arriving friends , little or no help . The bulletin board is in the icy cold , the clerks are ill-mannered , and the exit gates are arranged so as to be practically invisible . But meeting trains is easy compared to buying tickets . Why officials of a big railroad wo n't supply enough ticket agents , is something this feeble mind can not grasp . We ca n't believe that they dislike their customers .

Judgment THOSE incidents become amusing after success , which were sore points in more meagre times . Accordingly , Mr. Edward Justus Mayer , author of " The Firebrand " , takes delight now in recounting the story of his first meeting with Mrs. Elinor Glyn , whose one-time startling " Three Weeks " is by way of being Victorian in comparison with modern novels . It was when Mr. Mayer was only too glad to interview certain celebrities for a moving picture magazine and fifty dollars . La Glyn was indicated by the editor as one whose say would be interesting to his readers . The Lady Elinor received Mr. Mayer 's first question with a sigh , gazed at the orange draperies of the hotel room 's windows , and whispered : " Orange , orange ; that is the color of Love ! " Mr. Mayer tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance . " Orange , orange , " she breathed ; " that is the color of Love . " He made further overtures toward conversation , but each time he was stunned by the irrelevancy , " Orange ; that is the color of Love ! " Finally , Mr. Mayer picked his hat off the table . " Mrs. Glyn , " he concluded the interview , " I think you are a damn fool ! " Chanson de Gest WHEN the great Nemirovitch- Dantchenko , partner of the far-flung Stanislav-sky ' in the founding of the Moscow Art Theatre , arrived in our town the other day to supervise the impending season of their Musical Studio at Jolson 's , he learned that Morris Gest had set his heart on starting that season with the least operatic piece in the repertoire  --  the " Lysistrata " of Aristophanes . This may have surprised the Muscovite entrepreneur , who could not be expected to know that the dramatic sections of the Sunday newspapers have so much more space for lovely advance publicity than the Less pampered and less nourishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , a far bawdier entertainment than American college students have been permitted to discover ; and just when the unshackled Gest was meditating happily on the circumstance that here for once in a way , America would have access to an unexpurgated text , it dawned on him that after all the performance would be in Russian . And among the things with which the prowling Mr. Sumner is unfamiliar , the Russian language is one . It may be that so austere a liberal as Morris Gest shrank from the unworthy role of bootlegger of improprieties to the American sinner . Then , whereas what John Sumner does not know wo n't do him any harm , neither will it do Morris Gest any good . At all events , the translation on sale in the lobby will be a less cautious one than the trots hitherto available for the sheltered undergraduate . The courtesies compel us all to assume that any censorship of this text would give Brother Gest a pain in his aesthetic nature . But , after all , he has other aspects . And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush to the box office of the Century when his production of " Aphrodite " there was so helpfully denounced by the vociferously shocked Alan Dale , whose disapprobation was made even more conspicuous by being published right smack on the front page of Mr. Hearst 's American . At the time Mr. Gest denied with tears in his unsurprised eyes that this attack had been directed by Mr. Hearst as a personal favor to him . E xplanation WHO says a psychoanalyst ca n't he subtle ? We got the story from the man who lunched with Dr. Brill last week . It has to do with the explosion of an ardent feminist who met the eminent Doctor as he was leaving his office . " What do yen think of Ma Ferguson ? " asked the feminist . " I like her , " said Dr. Brill , looking through his glasses . " She sounds Eke a fine woman . " " But surely she has mismanaged things as Governor . " " That 's what I meant , " said Brill , getting into his taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the feminist stood fingering her stiff collar , and then exploded . This and That WITH no apologies and without humor , the Casual Observer says he has been to the " Greatest Collection of American Art " at the Grand Central Station , and to a collection of sculpture in soap by students at the Art Center in Fifty-sixth Street . Both appear to be equally interesting . The soap exhibition , he dilates , has no Childe Hassam , Chase , or Inness , but has nothing in it so wholly bad as some of the art-longings in oils of American illustrators . No names mentioned ; but we are assured they are present on the sixth floor of the Grand Central . It appears that the soap exhibit should be visited for its smell , if for no other reason . Color and sound have been sucking together at the breast of Art for some time , but not form and odor . From now on they will . A lovely smell of that which cleans pervades the corridors of the Art Center ; invites , charms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cunning little figurines and animals are standing around , in cases , very proud of themselves . He says they look for all the world like ivory  --  most of them arc Ivory , with an occasional touch of Lifebuoy . The sculpture is no laughing matter . Not half so ridiculous as the paintings in Forty-second Street , where the sublime and the unutterably tiresome are scrambled together . Anything that 's American , says the Casual Observer , is not a good formula . But he still thinks that having exhibitions in a railroad station is a very good idea . Also he thinks that now that half the world cleans itself with Cleansing Cream , Armour is probably going in for Art himself . Background WITH one recital in the open season for songbirds so very like another , it was only natural that one read in the papers with surprise that " someone with a happy instinct for the decorative had placed an enormous screen of shimmering peacock blue behind the piano . . . " which played for Miss Florence Kimball at Aeolian Hall last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decorative " , investigation proves , was Chamberlin Dodds , who sent Miss Kimball the screen with a note to the following effect : " Here , my dear , is my concert present to you . Just stick it up somewhere around the piano . This is a much easier way out for a man in my profession than dashing over to a florist 's and selecting the customary poison ivy . " Thus did it come about that for probably the first time in history something pleasant could be said in the newspapers about the stage of Aeolian Hall . Due Credit ALTHOUGH we fully appreciate the feelings of all Harvard men over the moral victory won by the Harvard team in holding Yale to a o-o tie , we can not allow what was originally a i00% Yale story to be pilfered by these sons of Harvard and passed as original . And the tale has been many times told about town ever since the fatal game . The authentic story originated early in the century . It appears that in one year , strangely enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very bad one . But the Elis , accustomed even then to giving odds , were willing to make a scare bet . Accordingly , a subscription was raised at New Haven , and an emissary sent to Harvard with instructions to make a hair-raising bet . Now the man to whom this fund was entrusted had one failing . Once , and only once , a year he got ( sic ) tight . Conclusions are obvious . He had been sober a long time . But none dreamed that in the boldness of his cups he would go so far as to bet all his friends ' money that Harvard would not so much as score . Consternation in New Haven . But when all the watches , fur coats and furniture had been duly pawned , it was found that the sum realized would just about hedge the original bet . Accordingly it was sent to Harvard ( by other hands ) and wagered that Yale would not score . The game even as this year was a o-o tie , and , thus , the Elis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parterre box , Number Four , at the Metropolitan , by Mr. Paul Helms has called forth the observation that only some ten such boxes have been sold outright in the last thirty years . Not the whole world knows that buying a parterre is very different from buying $200,000 worth of orchestra seats , but it is . As it happens , the price of a parterre box is not based entirely upon its musical or social value , whether real or fictitious , but to some extent upon its financial value . The parterre boxes , way back in 1883 , were given  --  thirty-five of them  --  to the original stockholders in the Metropolitan Opera &; Real Estate Company which leases the Thirty-eighth Street corner to the Metropolitan Opera Company . Recently this leasing company was offered seven millions for its property ; seven millions divided by thirty-five boxes makes $200,000 , which is somewhere near the price Mr. Helms is said to have paid . Not that the investment is good for widows and orphans  --  the distinction that accrues to box holders is supposed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money than it can spend . But the money invested is not necessarily lost or taken out in music ; the property value is inherent . So Mr. Helms steps in as one of the fixtures in our Opera House , with privileges and responsibilities nicely balanced . Many opera glasses will be leveled at the former Belmont box this season . Crusade OUR almost weekly advice from the source of all flickering drama , concerns , for the present issue only , the stern endeavors of one producer for the uplift of Hollywood . Ladling out one of his numerous edicts on this subject , the gentleman thwacked his desk as he thundered to Mr. Jack Holt , silent hero : " We must all understand this , Mr. Holt . My Corporation will never produce anything but good ( thwack ) , clean ( thwack ) , licentious ( thwack , thwack ) pictures . " Blues GEORGE GERSHWIN has come forward again with another piece of ambitious jazz , a concerto with the heat of the Charleston stirring it . This time he abandons Paul Whiteman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself under the wing of Walter Damrosch , the one whose wing covered Deems Taylor 's " Jurgen " not so long since  --  and who is on record as looking for " new blood " in music . Gershwin is new blood , beyond question , whether illuminated with genius , or merely of a novel color , is not yet , and may never be , decided ; he is young and ambitious and serious anyway . And he knows that the eyes of millions of jazz-lovers are fixed on him hopefully . It is most encouraging that he has managed to complete his education . In the early days he studied in the hope of making his mark among pianists , but he was forced to fall back on Tin-Pan Alley for a living . He took some harmony and counterpoint and orchestration under Rubin Goldmark , and some composition for the piano under Ernest Hutcheson . He was not too thorough , however . His earlier pieces such as the old hit , " I Was So Young and You Were So Beautiful " , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel competent to orchestrate , and had to turn over to professionals to put in shape . Ferdie Grofe. , who does nearly all such work for Mr. Whiteman , did the " Rhapsody " . In the concerto , however , Mr. Gershwin goes the whole road by himself , which should give him a new confidence and a new freedom , verdict I , ST Sunday 's baptism to profes-sional football gave me answers to two questions which I have heard debated all Fall . As supposed , the game decidedly is not played with collegiate desperation , but as a spectacular contest of skill , it is a good game , worth watching . Personally , I enjoyed being calm enough to look on unemotionally . I did n't care who won , I could appreciate clever plays on both sides . Mr. " Red " Grange I thought recognizable as a great player ; and the crowd did , too , for an electric wave swept the crowd every time he carried the ball . But there was nothing as thrilling in Grange 's performance as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive players . Who ran behind it was usually of little moment . The managers did their best to stimulate collegiate reactions . They draped the stands , even the goal posts , with rival colors ; they had a band ( there should have been two ) and their vendors sold dyed feathers which a few thousand wore in their hats . The crowd was all with them ; it wanted desperately to have some of the fun it had watched in the partisan stands of college towns . It fairly ached for cheer leaders and cheers . But perhaps the most realistic bit was on the field , in the closing moments of the game . The Giants , now hopelessly beaten in their Big Game , were making a last desperate stand when from the benches came a succession of blue and crimson substitutes . Bob Folwell , the Giant 's coach , was putting on the last touch . He was sending in the bench-warmers to get their letters . Check enclosed , one might even say . The Bearded One THE Whitman exhibition in the Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue through the present month . So far , some twelve hundred persons have visited it per day , so that better than fifty thousand will see it before the first of the year . Walt Whitman was a personal poet , which means that people love him . In the cases are portraits of the poet , photographs , letters and autographs , translations of his works , books from his library , biographies and critiques , contributions to periodicals , famous editions , and manuscripts of poems . It is the usual spectacle of genius at work --  -- erasing , crossing out , interlining , hesitating , changing . The photograph of his room , all in disorder , with his big hat lying on a pile of books , is more than worth seeing . And the pictures of his father and mother , looking , incidentally , much like everybody else 's . Particularly that of his mother ( except that she has cross eyes ) , which is in the next case to manuscript in which he announces that he will send his " barbaric yawp over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she would be very suspicious of a son who would talk such nonsense as that . She probably was ; which should encourage twelve hundred people a day , anyway . Not least interesting is the plaster sketch of the memorial to the poet by Jo Davidson , proposed for Battery Park . The first lines of " The Open Road " are to be inscribed underneath the figure , as a sort of exhortation to loafers thereabouts , perhaps . It shows Whitman striding along with the wind in his beard . And it should do the dingy old park a tot of good to have him there . ? TORIES from Summer resorts still roll in from time to time . It seems Mr. Edwin Arlington Robinson , the poet , was in Petershorough , New Hampshire , at the MacDowell Colony , just as that educated society was trying out a motherly new headwaitress in the dining room . Mr. Robinson , understand , is a most retiring person . But the headwaitress did not know it . She was full of health ; her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom . " That woman , " said Mr. Robinson , quietly , after he had suffered more of her solicitation than lie could bear , " is so damned motherly that she makes me feel illegitimate . " THE NEW YORKER Successor IN the late afternoon , not even the kindly shadows of the Sixth Avenue Elevated structure can hide the new shabbiness of the building 's exterior . The scars of the remodeller 's assault are upon its face ; and dusty planks groan as the laborer trundles his wheelbarrow into the dimness . Transition is upon the place in all its untidy agony , and dirt . There George Luks used to bring the aura of glamorous characters , which surrounded him in a more stalwart and lustier heyday . They will nod and smile and wag a time-fattened finger at you , and tell you of the argument with the Irish waiter and subsequent ejection to the reiterated " I , sir , am George Luks . " Or , wait a minute , perhaps we were not thrown out after all . The wine bins were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at best . There were a dozen other colorful groups welded into one clique of those who considered the amenities of dining a part of the graceful art of living . The pageant has passed , and only the Elevated remains to echo a hollow knell over the shrine . On its outside wall is a new sign : CC Another high class Princeton Cafeteria will be installed in a modern building on this site . " Scramble two with a side of toast has taken the place of truffles and terrapin . Under the latter-day legend , one may observe in dusty gilt , " Mouquin . " Measure IT is inevitable that Mr. Edouard Steichen , who does that artistic photography which embellishes so many pages of Metropolitan publications , should have calls for private practice . One such came lately from a young lady whose father , during the war , had taken government contracts until it hurt . " I should be charmed , " murmured Mr. Steichen , professionally courteous , in reply to the telephonic inquiry . " And how much do you charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One thousand dollars . " A gasp  --  a distinct gasp  --  and then : " One thousand dollars ! Why , how large a picture do you take ? " New York Bridge BRIDGE players are asked by the Cavandish Club to note that there are some five hundred and fifty clubs in London where the sexes may 1 ) ) kt ?  --  " A and play bridge , whereas in New York there is but one  --  to wit the Cavandish . The Knickerbocker Whist Club , which offers mixed bridge every Thursday is not counted ; the Knicker- bocker is a masculine affair , and much too bad mannered in the card room to suit ladies . At least that 's what the more sensitive aver . The Cavandish Club opened last month with the Godspeed of Major and Mrs. Granville Fortescue , Mr. Frank Crowninshield , and Mr. White- head and other experts formerly at the Knickerbocker . There is to be bridge at two and a half cents , with a table for one-centers and perhaps five as well ; and there is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a club luncheon on Tuesdays . The problem is difficult ; for it is generally admitted that society demands a cer- tain amount of good manners , and that good bridge is usually a pretty rude affair . However , the Cavan- dishers promise they will he pleasant to one another . The authorities , backed up by the Mayfair House at Sixty-fifth and Park , are confident of success . They say that a place where husbands and wives can play bridge without playing with each other is sure to be a big suc-cess.
