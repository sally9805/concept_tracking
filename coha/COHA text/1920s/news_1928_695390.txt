txt At a church lawn . party in the Jew Hampshire Manchester , officers of the W. C. T. U. protested against the serving of root beer . They have been jeered by the light-minded , the uninformed ? and the vicious . Not all root beer can be honored with a place among non-intoxicants . There is a virtuous root beer , and there is a wicked root beer .. The former is the child of artificial carbonation , manufactured by the bottlers , sold in a multitude of shops and stands and washing down part of the national mileage of " hot dogs . " The other is brewed , usually ? in the home . contains dangerous potentialities and is specifically forbidden by a New Hampshire statute which prohibits the sale of " any fermented , brewed or malt liquors . " Mr. ORMUZ D. Howitan , State Chemist , has often had to warn rootbeer brewers that their supposedly blameless beverage , if " prepared by " the use of yeast , is a ' fermented " liquor ' " ' by the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State . In 1916 the State Supreme Court affirmed a conviction for the sale of a beer containing .55 of 1 per cent . That percentage was then acknowledged to be non-intoxicating . Under the wiser dispensation of Mr. VOLSTEAD the culprit would also have been guilty of violating what a New Hampshire statesman , now on the road for the Republican prohibition candidates , has rudely called " a jackass law . " Laws are to be obeyed . The Manchester W. C. T. U. deserves honor for its condemnation of the vending of illegal and intoxicating drink . The State Chemist has clothed in irony a reproof of this generation of home-brewers that will set the good on guard against putting an enemy in their mouths by inadvertence : Yeast cakes , plus sugar of any kind , plus water , plus a little warmth and a reasonable amount of patient waiting , will inevitably result in a - nom or less spirituous fluid , provided only the yeast was potent . Essentially , the degree of resulting alcoholization is , within certain limits , dependent only upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting before such fluid is corked up . The amount of alcohol produced is the same , whatever the flavoring , whether it has come from hops , malt , raisins or extractives from roots and herbs . The only difference is that the root and herb extracts " appeal to many as being more moral in character , " just as many persons who shuddered at whisky-drinking used to swig patent medicines , some of them of almost incredible ' alcoholic content . Let the home-brewer and the truly Dry mark and perpenti : Many a . brewer of light beer of the malt variety has paid a fine when , if he had been content to adopt a flavorine of sassafras or . spruce gum , with perhaps the application of a little less yeast and waiting , he never would have been molested .. There is apparently a certain sanctity about the odor of Sassafras which is wanting in malt , and the latter also has the handicap of bad repute . Home-brewers and drinkers of the flavored , fermented danger , be not deceived l Nature will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only safety for the sincere , Dry is to have his home brew , made or bought , analyzed by a competent chemist .
