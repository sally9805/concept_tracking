txt AUDUBON 'S BOOK SCARCE . This year is the hundredth since Audubon 's " Birds of America " was published , and it was not completed until 1838 , when the final plates of " the greatest ornithological work ever produced " were distributed to subscribers . Since that time an increasing interest in birds and in the life of Audubon , the artist-naturalist , has developed . His " Birds of America , " depicting practically all of the then known birds . of North America , remains a monument to him . Unfortunately , however , this first large folio edition is becoming very scarce . There is a great demand for individual plates for framing and display by lovers of the unusual and artistic . This means the gradual dissolution of complete sets which are scarce enough now . Before it is too late , it is to be loped that libraries , colleges and museums will acquire such complete sets as may be avaliable . Madison , N. J. , Aug. 30 , 1927.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
