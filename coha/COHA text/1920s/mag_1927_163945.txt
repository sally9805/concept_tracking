In Philadelphia , a show opened last week , at the Print Club . It was an exhibit , by Mrs. Charles L. Brown , of prints of cats , made during the last 400 years . They were from all quarters of the world , and from such masters as Rembrandt , Drer and Hokusai down through the illustrators of Godey 's Lady 's Book to present artists of varying fame . <P> A Drer print shows Adam and Eve with a feline between them ; Rembrandt represents The Holy Family itself " ... With Cat " ; there is also the famed cat of Visscher ( 1629-62 ) , earliest of master line engravers , copies of which are now rare indeed . The prints used for Godey 's Lady 's Book reveal how widespread was puss 's honored position in 19th Century society . The best ladies were seldom seen without a cat or cats , which were , in fact , so numerous that children fell over them in parlors.               @ @ @ @ @ @
