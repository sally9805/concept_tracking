Air travel in the U. S. is soon to emerge from the spasmodic era of the thermos bottle , the cheese sandwich and the leather jacket . Passengers ' safety and comfort are , above all else , to command the attention of the newly formed Transcontinental Air Transport , Inc. , which announced its plans last week . It will put into operation , within six months or a year , a 48-hour train &; plane service between Manhattan and Los Angeles . <P> Passengers will board a train at the Pennsylvania Railroad station in Manhattan at 6:05 p. m . Having dined and played and slept and breakfasted , they will step off the train next morning at 8:30 in Columbus , Ohio , where they will be whisked to an airport . Trimotored planes of 14-passenger capacity will be waiting to receive them . Each plane will have two pilots , a steward , light refreshments , room for hand baggage , a luxuriously furnished cabin with ample observation windows .

The passengers will then get on a Santa Fe train for a famed Fred Harvey dinner and a good night 's sleep . Next morning , somewhere in New Mexico ( the city has not yet been chosen ) , the travelers will again take plane and hop to Los Angeles , completing their journey at 6 p. m . Fred Harvey will also furnish the sky refreshments . <P> Going the other way , passengers will leave Los Angeles by plane at 8:30 a. m. , arrive in Manhattan by train 48 hours later . Thus , the same plan of flying by day and railroading by night will be followed in both directions . This will , no doubt , comfort nervous passengers who might not like the sky at night , and please scenic lovers who might like the view by day . Also , greater safety will be achieved by the elimination of night flying . The treacherous Alleghany mountains will be crossed by train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one of many that the Transcontinental Air Transport , Inc. , plans to cover by train &; plane .

" I can foresee where we may be using a thousand ships or more within a few years , " said Walter Sands Marvin of Hemphill Noyes &; Co. , one of the 19 directors of Transcontinental Air Transport Inc . <P> Cost . The total fare between Manhattan and Los Angeles will be some $375 , as compared with the present railroad fare ( including cost of drawing room ) of $335. *
