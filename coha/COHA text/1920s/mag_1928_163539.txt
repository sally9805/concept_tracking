The Bachelor Father . " Legitimate " is a phrase used to describe those stage productions which are neither cinemas nor vaudeville acts ; it is perhaps paradoxical that legitimate plays have of late shown an increasing tendency to concentrate upon the question of illegitimate children . Plots are hung often upon the query ; ' ' Whose baby are you ? " The Bachelor Father was brought to Broadway by David Belasco , who has so frequently been called the dean of Manhattan theatrical producers that he always wears a canonical collar . It deals gently and tenderly with a lovable old libertine who , in his dotage , calls his bastards to him from the ends of the earth that he may be entertained by inspecting the consequences of his sin . <P> There are , as he thinks , three of these . One , a girl , is a shy little songbird from Italy , whose mother was a reckless diva ; one is an impetuous English youth ; the third is Antoinette Flagg , a saucy minx from the back alleys of Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's capacious mansion ; soon it becomes apparent that they regard their father rather than themselves as the proper object of a critical inspection . Having inspected , they , decide to adopt him , and he , bewildered but delighted , decides to keep his children . But one of them , the English youth , to the great disgust of Sir Basil , turns out to be the son of another father and immediately sets about marrying the opera singer 's offspring . To Sir Basil 's further chagrin , the U. S. illegitimate , whose coy and daring cajoleries have made her his " favorite little bastard , " falls in love with his solicitor ; when she has achieved her father 's consent to their marriage , she calls the curtain down by prettily observing : " Well , anyway , it will be the first wedding in this family ! " <P> Despite the preoccupations of its plot , this drama is as innocuous and sweet as vanilla ice-cream . June Walker plays the part of Sir Basil 's U. S. representative with soft and flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debut in the chorus of Hitchy Koo , and has since taken its verbal last syllable for a motto . Often , she coos the most extravagant slang that can be found for her tissue-paper tongue to enwrap . She has done this in Six Cylinder Love , Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , The Love Nest . <P> Marriage on Approval . A year ago the same play , except for minor details , was offered under the simple title Trial Marriage . As it was then , it is now , a too wordy , too self-serious story . of a wistful but determined chit who refused to marry the man she loved until she had tried living with him , and who then , through the machinations of a reedy villain , goes to jail for a shooting instead of to church for a wedding . Sadder and less idiotic , she gets out in time for the last act . The action of the play is ample but is gathered after too many innings of intense conversation . Phyllis Poyah acts it well .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
