txt // Dean Aldrich , who is said to have been the adaptor of English words to many of the Cantiones &term; which have found their way into the books of various cathedrals in England . Certain of these " anthems " of Birde 's are still occasionally sung , and by them is his fame chiefly transmitted to posterity . The canon " Non nobis , Domine , " which is generally believed to be his , and which is the best known of all his compositions , is not found in any of his acknowledged works . It was assigned to Birde by Dr. Pepusch in 1730 in his Treatise on Harmony , and Dr. Barney asserted that it was to be found in Hilton 's " Catch that catch can , " with his name attached . This is not the case in the editions of that work printed in 1652 and 1658 . The canon is there printed , but no author 's name is appended . Dr. Tudway in the MS. collection of music alluded to above , assigns it to Thomas Morley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestrina upon the authority of Carlo Ricciotti , in a concerto published by him at Amsterdam about 1740 . The earliest known copy is in Hilton 's book , and Burney may have seen an earlier edition than either of those before quoted , an edition which Rimbault says was published in 1651 . The subject , which is common property , has been used by Palestrina in a madrigal " When flow'ry meadows deck the year , " and Birde employs it himself in " Sed Tu , Domine , " the second part of " Tristitia et anxietatia , ' ' in the Cantiones Sacrce . Handel , Bach , Mozart , Mendelssohn , and others have used the subject , but the treatment is probably Birde 's , and could only have boen mistaken for the work of Palestrina because the canon , engraved on a // golden plate , is preserved iu the Vatican , and being without an author 's name attached to it , an Italian would naturally be inclined to attribute a work of such excellence to the father of ecclesiastical music in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blow and printed in the Amphion Anglicus , there is an allusion to this work " And there the rich produce doth still remain Preserv 'd intire in the Vatican . " The marginal note to this explains it to mean " Bird 's Anthem in Golden notes . " The evidence is therefore in favour of the claim made for our early English musician , if the " Canon " is understood to be the " Anthem . " As a man and as a citizen Birde seems to have been an exemplary character . Thomas Tomkins , his pupil , speaks in his " Songs of 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 parts , " 1622 , of his " ancient and much reverenced master . " Beacham , in his Compleat Gentleman published at the same date , says , " for motets and musicke of pietie and devotion , as well for the honour of our nation as for the merit of the man , I preferre above all other our Phoenix , Mr. William Byrd , whom in that kind , I know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suffered for conscience ' sake . There is extant a list of places frequented by certain recusants in and about London in the year 1581 , in which there is the following " Item , Wyll 'm Byred of the Chappele at his house in p'rshe of Harlington , in com Midds . " In another place he is said to be " a friend and abettor of those // beyond the sea . " He was then supposed to be residing with Mr. Lister , over against St. Dunstan 's , or at the Lord Padgette 's house at Draighton . In the Proceedings in the Archdeaconry of Essex , May 11th , 1605 , " William Birde , Gentleman of the King 's Majestie 's Chapell , is presented for popish practices . " His last years were spent in London in the parish of St. Helen 's Bishopsgate , over against Crosby Hall , where he had for neighbour Sir Thomas Gresham , whose garden adjoined his house . Thomas Morley , " his scoller , " also lived in the same parish , and Wilbye dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the names of his children appear in the registers of St. Helen 's church which date from 1565 . It is pleasant to believe that Gresham 's design of founding a college for the promotion of the seven liberal sciences may have been fostered by the neighbourly counsel of Birde , among other of the cultivated inhabitants of the parish . One of Birde 's sons , Thomas , was also a musician . It appears that he acted as a substitute , in 1601 , for Dr. John Bull , who was abroad for the benefit of his health , and read " the customary oration in Musick " at the newly-founded Gresham College . The Cheque-book of the Chapel Royal states that the time of the death of Birde , who is called the " Father of Musick , " was the 4th July , 1623 . The title here given may mean that he was " Father of the Chapel , " as the senior member is even now called ; and as such records only usually relate the position occupied in the place by the named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world of art . As a rule , ecclesiastical bodies know the members of their choirs only // by the offices they hold , and pay little regard to any reputation acquired outside their own walls by their subordinates . Posterity is willing to believe him to have been " Father in Music , " though his compositions are little known or studied in these days . This can scarcely be wondered at , for men , when they have learnt to read fluently and to express their thoughts lucidly , never dwell with particular rapture upon the beauties of the alphabet , or commend the literary graces of the spelling book . None , however , would be so foolish as to condemn either as of no value , but on the contrary , fully recognise their importance to the extent of their worth . The musical compositions of Tallis , Birde , and their predecessors , stand in the like relation to musical art as tiro Morn-book and Primer do to literature . The lessons they contain may be read with profit , and need be studied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated in its infant stages . The restricted rules which fettered the employment of the chord-combinations allowed in their time were often dealt with so ingeniously as to awaken admiration in the minds of those whose predilections are chiefly in favour of modern freedom in the use of musical resources . The old masters used their knowledge conscientiously , and although they did not despise the advantages of commercial protection for their labours , were not insensible to the claims of Art , as known and practised in their days . Some of their works have descended to the present generation , and are held in high estimation . This would scarcely be the case were they written to // minister to a passing fancy , or in conformity with an ephemeral taste . The good is good throughout all ages , and so long as men have the power of knowing good from evil , the oldest heritage from Adam , things which at one time may be deemed old-fashioned will agair form a nucleus for admiration and imitation . CHAPTER V. JOHN BULL , THOMAS MORLEY , THOMAS TOMKINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found attached to compositions both sacred and secular , which are still extant , or whose names alone are recorded in books or documents of the time of Tallis and Birde , but whose works have not been preserved . Some there were who were called Church Composers , chiefly on the ground of their having contributed an anthem or a service to the list of cathedral music , but whose fame now rests upon their contributions to the literature of music . The name of I ) r . JOHN BULL may be included in the list of Church musicians , although very few of his works or the Church are now known He was famous in his own day , and the name he bore , that by which the Englishman generally is familiarly called , has induced some well-meaning , but easily-satisfied people to assign to him the authorship of the National Anthem , " God save the King , " written , as they say , in 1607 , when King James and Prince Henry visited the Merchant Taylors ' Hall . // The rhythm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period at least one hundred years later . John Bull was born in Somersetshire about the year 1563 . He was one of the children of Queen Elizabeth 's Chapel , and received his musical education under William Blitheman , one of the first appointed organists to the Queen , who died in 1591 , and was buried in the church of St. Nicolas Cole Abbey , London . Bull was appointed organist and master of the children in Hereford Cathedral in 1582 , a place he held for nearly three years . In 1585 he was sworn in as Gentleman of the Chapel , taking his turn as organist according to the prevailing custom . In 1586 ( July 9th ) he was admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Music at Oxford , " having practised in that faculty fourteen years . " In 1592 he took the degree of Doctor of Music at Cambridge , and on July 7th , 1592 , was admitted ad eundem gradum at Oxford . He was appointed the first professor of music in Sir Thomas Gresham 's newly-founded college , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was unable to deliver his lectures in Latin , as all the other professors were and are bound to do , he was permitted to read his in English , The Ordinance refers to ? " The solemn music lecture twice every week , in manner following , viz. the theoretique part for one half-hour , or thereabouts , and the practique , by concert of voice or instruments , for the rest of the hour , whereof the first lecture should be in the Latin tongue , and the second in English ; but because at this time Mr. Dr. Bull , who is recommended to the place by the Queen 's most Excellent Majesty , being not able to speak Latin , his lectures are // permitted to be altogether in English , so long as he shall continue in the place of music lecturer there . " This permission has been extended to all the subsequent professors of music in Gresham College . When Bull went abroad for the benefit of his health in 1601 , he obtained permission to have his duties as lecturer taken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Birde . IIe travelled into France and Germany , and Antony Wood tells a story of him when he visited St. rimers . There lived there a fatuous musician , to whom Bull , without making himself known , applied " to learn something of his faculty , and to see and admire his works . " This musician showed him a song of forty parts , and vauntingly challenged any one to add another part to it . Bull at his own request , was left alone with the score , and added forty more parts to it . At which the " famous musician , " after carefully examining it , burst into an ecstasy , and declared that the writer must be either the devil or Dr. John Bull . In like manner Sir Thomas More greeted Erasmus after some extraordinary exhibition of scholarship , " Ant to es Erasmus , aut Diabolus . " John Bull returned to England by command of Queen Elizabeth , retained his appointments in the Chapel Royal upon the accession of James I. , and , as a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his son upon the occasion of their visit , before referred to . While the king sat at dinner , " Bull being in a citizens gowne , cappe , and hood , played most excellent melodie uppon a small payre of organs , placed there for that purpose onely , " as John Stowe it // relates . He resigned his office at Gresham College in 1607 , on his marriage with " Elizabeth Walter , of the Strand , maiden , aged about twenty-four . " In 1611 , he received a salary of X40 as one of Prince Henry 's musicians , and in 1613 went abroad to the Nether-lands again , as the Cheque-book of the Chapel Royal states " without license , and entered into the Arch-duke 's service . " Dr. Ward , in his lives of the Gresham professors , suggests as the reason for Bull 's retirement , " that the science began to sink in the reign of King James from the want of Court patronage , which it seems induced the musicians of that day to dedicate their works to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reason to complain of the indifference of the royal family to his abilities , and it is probably to other causes , now unknown , that his departure from England must be attributed . The further particulars of his life are uncertain . All that is known of him is that he was appointed organist of Notre Dame in Antwerp in 1617 , and died there , and was buried in the cathedral in 1628 . Antony Wood states that he died in 1630 , at Lubeck or Hamburg , which is not true . ' // The only pieces of Bull which have been printed , are some lessons in Parthenia , to which work Birde and Gibbons also contributed ; and two anthems , " Deliver me , 0 God , " in Barnard 's collection ; and " 0 Lord my God , " in Boyce 's collection . There are the words of two other anthems given in Clifford 's Anthem Book , 1663 . Several anthems , canons , and virginal pieces exist in MS. , but the need for printing them has passed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir William Leighton 's " Teares or Lamentations of a Sorrowfull Soule , " 1614 , and in the year 1843 a prayer and plain-chant with organ accompaniment was reprinted . The Sacred Harmonic Society possesses a MS. collection of organ music which contains several pieces by Dr. Bull ; and these are nearly all the known compositions of the once great musician . Notwithstanding the small amount of music by him now extant , his influence over his contemporaries and successors must be admitted . He shows by precept and example that instrumental music was capable of independent expression . His vocal pieces that are known are full of dignity and solemnity proper to their purpose , and his instrumental pieces for organ , virginals , or viols , his Canons and Fancies , exhibit great freedom and ideality . In the Part h.enia , the variations made by Birde on " The Carman 's Whistle , " are of a more set and artificial character than the pieces by Bull or Gibbons . Birde probably originated the style of making brilliant passages , but never seemed to be // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two musicians associated with him in the book . Bull was the first , moreover , who attempted to employ modulations , and although some of his essays in this direction are not satisfactory , as for example , in the piece called " Dr. Bull 's Jewel , " the transition from G to F , or from C to B flat , still they showed a desire to extend research by not strictly adhering to the old modes to which his predecessors confined their essays . In this respect he may be regarded with veneration , as one of the pioneers of the extension of thought in music , which led to greater results in time to follow . Some of the passages in his virginal pieces anticipated in point of difficulty of execution those of John Sebastian Bach , and his imitators or followers , in striving to do what Bull had done , often exceeded their pattern by adding something to knowledge already acquired . Thomas Morley the " Stoller of William Birde , " iu his compositions for voices , his Ballets , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthems , laboured to do for vocal music what was being done elsewhere for instrumental . His melodies are flowing and well ordered , when compared with those of his predecessors , and this quality has been attributed to his knowledge of Italian writers , who even at that early date exhibited their powers in constructing musical tunes . Many of his madrigals contain " quotations " from Italian writers . Whether in consequence , or in spite , of this practice of " conveyance " it is not known , but an edition of his Ballets was printed in 1595 with Italian words , probably for exportation , an edition of // which no perfect copy is in existence . Morley 's reputation in the present day is chiefly based upon his Plaine and easie Introduction to Practicall Musicice , first published in 1597 , and considered to be a book of such utility that editions were constantly sold and reprinted as late as the year 1770 . It has been said that Morley 's knowledge of Italian musical productions probably suggested to him the idea of compiling the Triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Queen Elizabeth , after the manner in which Padre Giovenali was said to have collected the writings of thirty-seven of the most famous Italian composers , under the title of Temprlo Ariaonico della neatissima Veryine nostra Signora , Rome , 1599 . This statement was made by Dr. Burney in his History of Music , to support the theory which he strove to maintain in that work , that , however good the musicians of other nations might be , they were inferior to the Italians and probably derived all they knew from them . Other writers assume that the idea was suggested by a set of Italian madrigals , called It trionfo di Dori , printed in Antwerp in 1601 , the year in which the Triumphs of Oriana appeared . it is a matter of little consequence whether Morley was or was not indebted to an Italian original for the " happy thought . " The Triumphs of Oriana are still known and admired , but few except Dr. Burney would recognise it as a work called into existence by Padre Giovenali .

Ile took the degree of Bachelor of Music at Oxford , July 8th , 1588 , two years after John Bull . He held the place of deputy chorister at St. Paul 's in 1591 , and took his turn as organist as usual . He left St. Paul 's in 1592 , July 24th , upon his admission to the Chapel Royal as epistler . He published his Canzonets , or little short Songs to three Voyces , in 1593 ; . iladrigall , for fours Voyces , 1594 ; The First booke of Ballets to five voices , 1595 , - the Italian edition already spoken of was printed in the same year ; The first book of Canzonets to Two Voyces with seven fantasies for instruments , in 1595 ; Canzonets , or Little Short Aers to five and sixe voices , in 1597 ; The First Boolce of Aires , or Little Short Songes to sing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and edited several other works at various times . The Plaine and easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke . Set downe in forme of a dialogue : Derided into three Partes ; the first teacheth with all things necessary , for the knowledge of a priekt song . The second teachcth of deseante and to sing two parts in one upon a plain song or ground , with other things necessary for a descanter . The third and last part entreateth of composition of three , foure , five or more parts , with many profitable rules to that effect , with new songs of 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 parts ; was published in 1597 , and was the first work on Practical music issued in England . It went through many editions , and was even translated into German by Johann Caspar Trost , of Halberstadt , in or about the year 1660 . Morley wrote many pieces for the Church , but none // of them were printed in his lifetime . A service in D minor , and one in G- minor , were included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service by Morley , the first of the kind written to English words , is in Boyce 's collection , 1770 . The time for the exclusive printing of music-books , stated in the patent granted to Tallis and Birde by Queen Elizabeth , having expired in 1596 , Morley in 1598 obtained a similar one with extended powers , Under his licence William Barley , Thomas Est , alias Snodham , Peter Short , John Windet , and others , printed several books as the " assigne of Thomas Morley . " Upon October 7th , 1602 , George Woodson was sworn into Morley 's place in the Chapel Royal . Both Burney and Hawkins state that Morley died in 1604 ; he tiny , therefore , probably have resigned , as there is no mention of the vacancy having been caused by death . Morley was a very good musician , as many of his ballets and madrigals show . His melodies are superior to any of those by writers who preceded him , and there is no doubt that the example he set in disentangling music from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the sequence of chords , necessitated by a too slavish adherence to the " Modes , " entitle him to be classed among those who did much towards enfranchising secular music from the uses hitherto employed in composition . From his time forward writers did not hesitate designedly to set down melodies which should convey some sort of expression when connected with words , a matter which had only keen achieved by accident in times before . // The labours of such writers as were associated with Morley in the production of the Triumphs of Oriana , Michael Este , Daniel Norcome , John Mundy , John Benet , John Hilton , George Marson , Richard Carlton , John Holmes , Richard Nicolson , Thomas Tomkins , Michael Cavendish , William Cobbold , John Farmer , John Wilbye , Thomas Hunt , Thomas Weelkes , John Milton ( the father of the poet ) , George Kirbye , Robert Jones , John Lesley , Edward Johnson , and Ellis Gibbons , do not entitle them to be registered in the list of Church composers , although nearly all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wrote anthems . The titles as well as the substance of some of their productions of this character are still preserved and known . The charm which is found in the music of all these old writers , and the satisfaction which it always brings to the ear , arises from the manner in which they all employ tonal in preference to dominant harmonies , and further from the tenderness with which the voices are used . " The humane voyce conteines but eleven diatonic notes ; ye doe well and ye use but nine or lesse if so it may be . " Wagner , and many of his followers in the present day , have discovered the use of the tonal harmonies ; the value of the limited compass of the " humane voyce " is yet to be revealed to them . Besides Dr. John Bull and William Birde , the names of John Milton , John Dowland , Alfonso Ferabosco . John Coperario , Thomas Weelkes , and John Wilbye , are named as contributors to Sir William Leighton 's Teams lr Lamentations . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , are in the Motett anthem form , in one movement , with points of imitation for the several voices , similar in construction to the madrigals in the Triumphs of Oriar , a . John Coperario was an Englishman who italianised his name , and who was famous as a writer for the lute and for viols . There were two composers called Alfonso Ferabosco , father and son , who were counted among the most eminent musicians of the reign of Elizabeth , but who do not appear to have held any court or chapel appointments , nor to have written any cathedral music . There is a service in D major by John Ferabosco still , to be found in the books of some of our English cathedrals , but it is not of sufficient importance to exalt the name of its author very highly . One of the first of the scientific musicians who did not think it necessary to keep his knowledge " within the body of the craft , " but gave it forth to the world , was Elway Bevin . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of his birth is unknown . Sir John Hawkins tells us that he was admitted to the post of Gentleman Extraordinary of the Chapel on June 5th , 1589 , upon the recommendation of Tallis . As Tails died in 1585 , this could not be true . The real date of his appointment was June 3rd , 1605 , twenty years after the death of Tallis . He was appointed organist of Bristol in 1589 , probably with a favourable testimonial from Tallis who was his master , and here he remained until the year 1637 , when he was compelled to resign his post and to relinquish his appointment at the Chapel Royal , in consequence of his adherence to the Romish faith . The authorities were less tolerant to him // than they had been to his predecessors . He wrote many services and anthems , some of which have been printed in Barnard 's and Boyce 's collections ; others remain in manuscript . His chief scholar was William Childe , afterwards organist of St. George 's Chapel , Windsor . Bevin 's greatest work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom he confessed himself " bound for many favours. ? This was A briefe and short Introduction to the Art of Musicke , to teach how to make Discant of all proportions that are in use ; very necessary for all such as are desirous to attaine knowledge in the art , and may by practice , if they can sing , soone be able to compose three , four , and five parts , and also to compose all sorts of canons that are usuall , by these directions , of two or three parts in one upon the plain Song . London , 1631 . Before the publication of this book the contrivance of canons was one of those mysteries which the musicians kept to themselves , or only permitted those who were their favoured pupils to acquire a knowledge of . Every canon when given in print was an enigma , the solution of which was known only to the enlightened few . Sometimes , in accordance with the growing fancy of the period and the want of correct taste in matters of pictorial art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles , in squares , and in wheel-like shapes " very pleasant to behold , " but very difficult to sing or play . Bevin 's book makes the art of composing canons as plain and simple as it can be . His precepts as to general composition are few and brief , but he gives rules For the construction of canons , and a variety of examples of almost all the possible forms in which // they are capable of being put together , even to the extent of sixty parts . His fellow musicians were probably not pleased with him for having exposed one of the secrets and mvsteries of their trade . It is a singular thing , that after the appearance of Bevin 's book there were very few examples of canons in fancy shapes to be found ; his exposure of the : art removed the mystery . In those days all men delighted in the occult . Even musicians were not exempt from the fascination of possessing some secrets which they desired to keep from the world . It is supposed that Bevin 's colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law against him , which forbids any Roman Catholic to hold office in the Chapel Royal , and so ultimately secured his dismissal in his old age . If we assume that he was twenty years old when he was appointed to Bristol Cathedral , he must have been nearly seventy when his name was removed . We can at least hope that his colleaIues were not so cruel . Nothing more i known of Bevin . After the removal of his name from the cheque-book of the Chapel he disappears from all records . It may be mentioned , that the whole of the examples in his book are constructed upon one figure of plain-song , and the author in speaking of a canoe three in one says : " A canon three in one hath resexn blance to the Holy Trinity , for as they are three distine parts comprehended in one : the leading part hatl reference to the Father , the following part to the Sonne the third to the Holy Ghost ; " a conceit which Hawkins thinks " devout but superstitious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are names which are found attached to anthems and to some hymn-tunes of the period from 1562 to 1620 , but it is sufficient here to mention their names for the benefit of those who may desire to find them in the list of Church composers . Their worthiest labours belong to other departments of music . One more name , among lesser musical luminaries , that of Thomas Tomkins , deserves notice . He was born at Gloucester , where his father was chanter of the cathe dral . He was admitted as a chorister of Magdalen College , Oxford , in the year 1596 , probably between the eighth and eleventh years of his age . He was appointed clerk in 1604 , by which time his voice must have changed , and usher in the school in 1606 , an office which he held for four years . He took his degree as Bachelor of Music , July 11th , 1607 . He was sworn in as gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1612 , and was afterwards organist . He is said to have been a pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three , four , five , and size parts , London , 1622 ; Musica Deo Sacra et Eeelesice Anglicance , or music dedicated to the honour and service of God and to the use of Cathedrals and other churches of England , especially of the Chapel , Royal of King Charles I. , and of many scattered services and anthems still to be found in cathedral books . " He was living after the Grand Rebellion broke out , but when he died I can not justly tell , you . " ' Thomas Tomkins in sacred music , and Thomas Bate-son in secular music , were the first who employed what luusicians calla discord of double suspension in thei ) 8 TUE GREAT MUSICIANS . , works , and for this reason his name deserves record , even thoiwh his light pales somewhat before the greater fire of Orlando Gibbons , his contemporary . ' CHAPTER VI . ORLANDO GIBBONS . ORLANDO GIBBONS was born in 1583 at Cambridge , in which place his father held a situation as one of the town waits or musicians . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a chorister in one of the college chapels , it may be readily imagined that he had plenty of opportunity of making himself acquainted with the labours of the Church musicians of that time . The new discoveries made in the domain of harinony , the cultivation of melody and canonic contrivance , had all reached a considerable pitch of refinement . Each new composer felt himself bound , not only to know what had been done by his predecessors , but to take up the clue where they had left or were leaving it . When Gibbons began to think for himself the whole of the kingdoin was , as it were , surrounded with an atmosphere of genius , which it is pleasant to imagine may have in lluenced the young Orlando . Like his namesake , he seems to ha , , e sought to be chivalric in his art , and to // employ its crudities as then practised , the better to be able to invest them with a certain poetical beauty , in manner like to Orlando in his subjugation of the evil tempters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add something fresh to existing knowledge were gathered together by him , and employed with greater confidence than heretofore . The music of his predecessors was like the massive grandeur of the Norman architecture ? simple , solid , plain and severe , yet noble . The writers nearer to his own date furnished a sort of transition to the style which he introduced , and which may be compared to the graceful beauty of the Early English buildings . The solidity of the Norman was preserved , but the square and formal lines were curved and rounded , new foliage and ornamentation introduced , which , though in soiree sort still conventional , led the way to the appreciation of decoration in imitated natural forms . Among his fellow-musicians Gibbons stands out in as clear and defined an outline as does Shakespeare among the many dramatists of Elizabeth 's reign . In his imagination , fancy , scientific knowledge , and in his power of concentration , Gibbons may be considered as the musical Shakespeare of his age , though he was not the Shakespeare of music generally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess such an amount of truth in expression that they still retain the power of pleasing and elevating the mind . The actual known facts of his life are few . He was admitted to the place of organist to the Chapel Royal on March 21st , 1604 , in the room of Arthur Cock . Here he earned a great // reputation as a clever player and " serious musician . " He wrote several pieces for " viols in consort , " some of which he published in 1610 , under the title of Fantasies in three parts . This work was " cut in copper , the like not heretofore extant , " and was among the first music printed in England from engraved plates . In the year following , in conjunction with Bull and Birde , Parthenia was issued . This also is noteworthy as having been " the first musicke printed for the Virginalls . " In 1612 his First set of Madrigals and Motets of 5 parts was printed , and in 1614 he wrote for George Wither 's Hymns and Songs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " with several others . In the same year Leighton 's Tea res and Lamentations appeared ; for this work Gibbons wrote two pieces . In 1622 , May 17th , he received with William Heyther , the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor in Music by accumulation at Oxford , but there is no record of his having been actually admitted to either degree . The eight part anthem , " O Clap your Hands , " printed in Boyce 's collection , upon which Gibbons is styled " Bachelor in Music , " was said to have been his exercise . The anthem is in two parts , the second part commencing , " God is gone up . " This division was according to the fashion of the time , which precluded lengthened movements in music . Madrigals were even so divided , and " Fancies or fantasias " were purposely short , and never indulged to the length a modern writer would take to express a fantasia ; but then the old writers had something to say when they wrote , and could afford to be epigrammatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // was written for , and accepted as , the exercise of Dr. William Heyther , who founded the chair of music in Oxford in 1627 , and took his degrees in 1622 as before said . If this was the case , the University authorities must have been very complaisant in those days . Hey ther carried with him to Oxford the deed of endowment of the chair of history founded by Camden , his intimate friend , and it is supposed that the University honoured the bearer with a musical degree in preference to one in arts or laws , as he was Vicar-Choral of West minster Abbey , a musician by occupation . At this historical establishment Gibbons was appointed organist in 1623 as successor to John Parsons . In his capacity as organist of the Chapel Royal he was commanded to attend King Charles on his road to Dover to meet the Queen Henrietta , whom he was to espouse . Gibbons had to compose the music for this occasion , but while he was at Canterbury he was seized with the small-pox , and died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cathedral there , and a monument was erected to his memory , having the following inscription // Of his seven children only one , Christopher , left s name to posterity . He was educated at Exeter Cathedral , under the care of his uncle Edward , one of the Priestvicars . In 1640 he succeeded Randolph Dewitt as organist of Winchester Cathedral , which place he was compelled to quit in 1644 , when he joined the Royalist army . It is supposed that he carried the thousand pounds which his uncle lent to the King , and for thus aiding his Sovereign , his estate was confiscated and he and his three grandchildren were turned out of their home , he being then over eighty years of age . His nephew Christopher was made organist of the Chapel Royal , of Westminster Abbey , and private organist to King Charles II . on the Restoration . Upon the recommendation of the King the University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Mus . Doc . in 1664 . He died Oct. 20 , 1676 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed compositions of Orlando Gibbons , in addition to those already named , comprise Preces , Services , and Anthems printed in Barnard 's and Boyce 's collections , and in the collection compiled in 1875 by Sir Frederick Ouseley , the present Professor of Music in the University of Oxford . In this last-named book there are thirty-four separate works , including some hymn tunes , organ transpositions of some of the anthems , and the service in F. Some of them are placed a note higher than that in which they were originally written , according to a custom common in Cathedrals when Gibbons ' music is sung . In his day the Church tone or pitch was evidently higher than that of the // Chamber tone or pitch , and Sir Frederick Ouseley points out that by raising the pitch of Gibbons 's church music , it is brought more into conformity with that of his own time . In support of this statement he adduces the follow-ing evidence from the Pars Organica of Thomas Tom-kins 's Musica Deo Sacra , a work published in 1668 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if living must have been by this time over eighty years old . " Sit tonus " ( the note F in the Bass clef ) " fistulae apertae longitudine duorum pedum et semissis ; sive 30 digitorium geometricorurn . " Now an open pipe of two feet and a half in length will not produce our modern F , but a somewhat sharp G , so it is plain that by transposing the Church music of that period upwards a whole tone , we are , in fact , restoring it to that pitch which was intended by the composer . The mention of the Pars Organica suggests some notice of the organ parts supposed to be played by the performers of the time of Gibbons . In the organ loft at Magdalen College , Oxford , a book of organ music which lay long neglected , on being examined was found to contain some very florid accompaniments to the well known service Gibbons in F. It is sup-posed that the part was played while the choir sang , and the character of the flourishes was not unlike the extemporaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years back , while accom-panying the Chants and Psalms . The passages in the organ part referred to bear some similarity to certain parts of the virginal music in Parthenia . There is no direct evidence that such was the manner in which // organists were wont to accompany vocal music in the service ; possibly such an arrangement may represent some effort of a composer , perhaps Benjamin Rogers , to supply a florid part for the organ after the prevailing fashion as regards compositions for the virginals . The list of printed music of Gibbons as compiled by Mr. Husk , may be seen sub voce Gibbons , in Grove 's Dictionary . CHAPTER VII . HENRY LAWES , ADRIAN BATTEN , WILLIAM CIHLDE , BENJAMIN ROGERS , MATTHEW LOCK . IT will be noticed in the list of works by Gibbons , that two of the five-voice verse anthems are with viols . This statement indicates a somewhat early use of those instruments of accompaniment to sacred music ; the parts are in unison with the voices , as was then common when they were employed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in certain ritornelli pas-sages while the voices were at rest . It has been asserted , and the supposition is a likely one , that " viols " were used to accompany the verse or soli parts , the full or chorus passages being supported by the organ . In the time of Gibbons the viol was coming into use , and as it was a fashionable instrument , the musicians of the period wrote frequently for it . Gibbons composed some Fancies for viols , and the celebrated John Jenkins , ' " the little roan // ? Vith a great soul , " did much to popularise the music of viols by his compositions for them in " Consort . " Gibbons was not equal to Jenkins in his instrumental works , but in vocal music he stands alone , and for his skill , his invention and facility , truly deserves the title by which he has been sometimes called , " The English Pa , lestrina . " In some respects Gibbons was more in advance of his time than Palestrina was in his , inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endeavour to free musical composition from what may be called ecclesiastical restraint , he made one of the first attempts to go farther a-field than the composers of times before had permitted themselves to stray . Most Church music was written in the Dorian mode , that is to say , in the key of D minor made out of the notes of the scale of C. Other modes were occasionally employed , such as the Hypodorian , the scale of A minor ; the Lydian and the Hypolydian , the scale of F with a sharp fourth , and that of C as it stands normally . Thus Tallis 's service is said to be in D minor , when , as neither sharp nor flat is placed at the beginning , which in old times only exhibited the shifting of the mode , not the change of key , it is in the Dorian mode . When sharps and flats became general in use in composition , it was to show modulation . These modu- lations led to the employment of different scales at different pitches , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on into the reign of Charles the First , that musicians thought of employing any other modes than tboge which would be represented in modsrn notation // by the key signatures of C , F , and occasionally but very rarely G , and their relative minors . The attempts at modulation would doubtless teach one , thina , namely , that it was possible to rnale excursions into " remote keys " in such a manner as to avoid the " wolf , " then to be found in all instruments of absolute pitch , whether of pipes , with strings , or with fretted finger-boards . These transitory modulations would in turn suggest the starting of compositions in remote keys , and so augment the power of expression , the breat charm of music , and the means by which the permutations of the scale may be made more subservient to musical elocution . One of the first of the Church writers who introduced expression as a design , and not by accident , was Henry Lawes . This is found in his songs , in which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and C minor actually , though written with one flat less than the signature needs to be correct . Following his example , men began to frame their music to fit the sense of the words , and poets wrote verses the wit and imagination of which have not even now lost their charms . Lawes probably derived his inspiration from a study of the composers of the Italian school , Monteverde , Jacopo Peri , Carissimi , and the lesser lights . He wrote several songs to Italian words after the Italian vein . Hawkins states that , although he " was a servant of the Church yet he contributed nothing to the increase of its stores ; " this may be correct in the present day , as none of his anthems are now heard . But if his anthems were like his songs , his name ought not to be omitted from the list of English Church composers , as by the constant employment of a sort of recitative parlante , // he led the way to a newer form of juster association of music and words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelham Humfrey at a later time . After Henry Lawes , who died in 1662 , there were several lesser writers whose object seemed to be to keep alive the almost extinguished fires of Church music , by raking together the half consurned embers , without attempting to add any new fuel of their own to excite it to brightness and warmth . They preserved the traditions as a body , while only one or two , it may be , ventured occasionally into making some contributions of their own , towards progress . Their efforts therefore are worthy of all respect as representing musical art in Church music , at a time when everything that could be done to crush life out of it was undertaken with a real wanton delight through a pretended desire for purity . The known particulars of the life of Henry Lawes are few , but a fair notion of his character may be formed from his preface to the first volume of his Ayres and , Dialogg , tes for one , two , and three Voices , 1653 . He mentions having written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Italians are great masters of music , but expresses his opinion that his own nation had produced as many able musicians as any in Europe . He censures the partiality of the age for songs sung in a lannuage which the hearers do not understand , and , in ridicule of it , speaks of a sang of his own composition , printed at the end of the book , which was nothing more than an index of the initial words of some old Italian songs or madrigals . He says , with some degree of sly humour , that this index , which he had set // to a varied air , and when read together was a strange medley of nonsense , passed with a great part of the world as an Italian song . In the year 1633 Henry Lawes and Simon Ives were ordered to compose the music to a masque , afterwards presented at Whitehall on Candlemas night ( Feb. 2 , ) before the Bing and Queen , by the gentlemen of the four Inns of Court ; for which they received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Comus , " which was represented at Ludlow Castle on Michaelmas night in 1634 . Milton 's friendship for the musician is supposed to have dated from this time . He inscribed a sonnet to him , commencing " Harry , whose tuneful and well measured song . " Other poets of the period laboured to do him honour in verse , but poets are not prophets , and the exalted estimation of posterity for his music , which they one and all foretold , has not been realised . In one respect the musicians of posterity ought to be grateful to Lawes , as he was the first musician who employed bars to his music to mark the place of accent and the rhythmical division of the melody , after the now common practice . What Lawes did in his secular music Adrian Batten seems to haved one in his Church compositions . His anthems , Deliver us , 0 Lord , and Lord we beseech Thee , in an old MS. book belonging to St. Paul 's Cathedral , have bars at regular intervals . The character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burney was scarcely justified in saying , " he was a good harmonist of the old school , without adding anything to the common stock of ideas in melody or modulation with which the art was furnished long before he was // born . Nor did he correct any of the errors in accent with which former times abounded . " It is somewhat singular that the two men who were doing like work in different degrees , should be so spoken of by the two historians of music , Hawkins and Burney . Batten was probably born at Winchester about the year 1590 . He was a chorister in the cathedral there under John Holmes the organist , and was appointed vicar-choral of Westminster Abbey in 1614 , and ten years later removed to St. Paul 's to become vicar-choral , and organist . His death is supposed to have taken place soon after the year 1649 . William Childe , Benjamin Rogers and Matthew Lock , were the other musicians of name who were men at the time of the Interregnum between the death of Charles the First and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bristol in 1605 , and became the pupil of Elway Bevin . In 1631 he graduated Bachelor in Music at Oxford , and upon the death of Dr. Nathaniel Giles succeeded him as organist and master of the children in 1633 . He was made one of the organists at the Chapel Royal after the Restoration , and took his doctor 's degree in 1663 . His compositions are of no particular originality . He apparently took Gibbons as his model , and constructed his music in imitation of his greater colleague . His sharp service in D , as a composition in the major was then called , was a great favourite with Charles the First , and contains such an amount of intricate contrivance that his contemporaries , knowing the general fashion of his compositions , doubted whether he was the author of it . It was - said to have been // written to puzzle the clioirmen by its complications , they having laughed at some of his music because it was so easy . He died March 23 , 1697 , in the ninetyfirst year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town-hall at Windsor , and fifty pounds to the corporation to be disposed in charitable uses . His name is associated with an act of liberality which deserves to be recorded . Some time before his death he promised to repair the choir of the chapel , if the Dean and Chapter would pay up the arrears of his salary which had been accumulating for many years . They paid the money , and he performed his promise ; " neither they nor the Knights Companions of the most noble Order of the Garter interposing to prevent it , or signifyin the least inclination to share with a servant and dependant of theirs in the honour of so munificent an act . " Dr. Childe was appointed to Windsor just as Benjamin Rogers went out into the world . Young Rogers had been the pupil of Dr. Nathaniel Giles , and was about 19 years old when his master died ; it is not at all likely that Dr. Child ( , , had any hand in his musical education , though it has been so stated . Benjamin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. George 's Cliapel , Windsor , was born in 1614 , and brought up as a chorister there . He was afterwards a singing-man in the same chapel . He was appointed organist of Christ Church , Dublin , but left that place when the rebellion broke out in 1641 , and returned to Windsor , where he once more obtained a. singing-man 's place . He continued to exercise himself in composition , and in 1653 wrote some airs for viols and organ which // were suit as great rarities to the court of the Arch-Duke Leopold , and by him greatly admired . The Germans of those days had not attained any such eminence as composers as the English . In 1653 his friend Dr. Nathaniel Ingelo , of Etou College , obtained letters of recommendation from Oliver Cromwell to the University of Cambridge to confer the degree of Bachelor of Music upon him , which was done , he being matriculated as a member of Queen 's College . When Dr. Ingelo went to Sweden as chaplain to Lord Whit'lock , he took with him several compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen . Christina with great liking . " The Hym nus Eucharisticus , now sung as part of the grace at the Gaudy , on July 22 , at Magdalen College , Oxford , was written by Dr. Ingelo , and Rogers set it to music of four parts . It was first performed at a feast at which the Lord Mayor , aldermen , and chief citizens of London entertained the king , the two dukes , and both Houses of Parliament . The hymn was afterwards altered for Magdalen College , and is now annually sung on the top of the tower of the college at five o'clock on May-day morning . About the year 1661 lie was appointed organist of Eton College . He was made organist of Magdalen College , Oxford , on July 22 , 1664 , and entered upon his duties on the 25th of January in the following year . lie was to receive the sum of sixty pounds a year , and lodgings in the college , the largest sum ever paid to the organist and informator ishoristarum up to that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of some of the Fellows , but when it was explained that " it was little enough for a man of that quality , at a time when J // organists were scarce , " we are further told that " nor had any man there to object against it . " He held the place until the year 1685 , when he was dismissed by the College , and not , as Hawkins says , " ejected by order of James II . " The king 's edict was not promulgated until the following year . Benjamin Rogers was dismissed for his own misdemeanours , and because of the scandalous behaviour of his daughter . The College gave him a pension of 301. for life . He died , at the age of 84 , in 1698 , and was buried on the 21st June in that year in the church of St. Peter le Bailey , in which parish he had lived his last years . He took his degree of Doctor of Music July 12 , 1669 , his music being the first ever performed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dedication of the said theatre to a learned use . " Dr. Rogers wrote much music for the Church ; services in F , as well as in D , A , and E , over twenty anthems , some half dozen pieces to sacred Latin words , four part songs , printed in Playford 's " Musical Companion , " 1673 , and a large number of instrumental pieces . The services are in constant use , but only three of his anthems are generally known , Behold , now praise the Lord ; Teach rite , 0 Lord ; and Lord , who shall dwell . The adherence to ancient practices is exemplified in some of his sacred music . The anthem . Teach me , 0 Lord , is actually in the key of A , but there are oray two sharps to the signature . The indication of a leaning towards the disregard of ancient rules . gives one of the peculiarities to his music . When he employs the seventh in a chord . he frequently makes it ascend // before resolving , a practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated by Humphrey Wanley to Samuel Pepys , in a letter dated June 25 , 1699 , which will be interesting to students of ancient Greek music " Three tunes of the ancient Greek music are hymns of one Dionysius , inscribed lie llovaav ets ' A7rox-wPa , and ecs N ' eviv . These tunes were turned into our common notes , as I have reason to think , by Dr. B. Rogers , at the instance of Archbishop Usher . As for Dr. B. he was well known to be an able musician , but I doubt whether he had much studied the Ancient Greek Music . " i It is not difficult in many cases to trace the chain of connection or succession in the musicians of one country in any period , one with another , and it is not a trouble-some task to show in what respect Matthew Lock 's name ought to be mentioned among the list of English Church composers in succession to that of Rogers . They were associated as authors in the publication of some instrumental music under the title of Courtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were secular sono s or instrumental pieces , though it is reasonable to suppose from his style and other evidences that his first essays of composition were in the field of Church music . As far as can be ascertained , very few of his anthems have been printed , although several remain in MS. , among others those that have the accompaniments of " viols , sag butts , and cornets , " as well as organ . His genius found easiest and earliest expression in this form of // composition . A Little Consort of Three Parts , was composed at the request of his old master and friend Mr. Wm . Wake . William Wake was organist of Exeter Cathedral after Edward Gibbons died , and Lock , who was born in the western city in 1619 , was educated as a chorister in the cathedral . The publication of this work was made in 1656 . Lock was Composer in Ordinary to the Ding . He was called upon to write the music played when the king went from Whitehall to the Tower , April 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment as a reward . Hawkins says that " be was a man of a querulous disposition , and therefore it was not to be wondered at that lie had enemies . " He wrote a service for the Chapel Royal , and set the responses to the Commandments ten different ways . This was contrary to the usual custom , and occasioned some ol ) position on the part of the choir , who scent to have been very childish in their tenacity of newly restored old customs , for Church music had been for a long time silent . Lock was equally injudicious , for lie published the service with a preface vindicating his action , couched in no conciliatory terms : Modern Church Musick , Pre-accused , Censur 'd and %strutted in its Poformance before His Jfo jesfy , April 1 , 1666 . Vindicated by the Author , Matt . Lock , Composer in Ordinary to flis Majesty . If Lock had been living in our own time his trenchant pen would probably have been in great request , and would have found much employment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand expert in its craft . Its lucubrations would have been eagerly looked for week // by week . They would probably have had the doubtful gain of securing a circulation for the journal in which they appeared , and of keeping in motion a round of indignant resentment , and so would have fulfilled all conditions . Lock became a convert to the Romish faith , resigned his appointment in the Chapel Royal , and was attached to the Chapel of the Queen at the Palace of Somerset House , where she had an ecclesiastical establishment . Ile wrote instrumental music for many of the plays of the period . For Davenant 's perversions of The Tempest , and Macbeth , in which the songs and choruses from Middleton 's Witch were introduced . Some controversy has been raised as to his right to be called the author of this famous music . Some saying that it was written by Purcell , some by Eccles , some by Leveridge . But Lock 's claim has been accepted on all sides . It is amusing to speculate upon the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work been called into question in his lifetime . He was nothing if not controversial . In 1673 he composed most of the music for Shadweli 's Psyche , which was published in 1675 , under the title of The English Opera This was prefaced by a few remarks couched in his usual bitter style . In 1.672 he became entangled in a controversy with one Thomas Salmon , who proposed " to cast away all clefs , " and to write music for voices after the same scale , indicating the voice by which it was to be sung , by the letters T. M. and B. ; for Treble , Mean or Tenor , and Bass . In addition to his compositions , which are of a " robust vein , " Lock // published in 1673 a book called Melothesia , or , Certain General Rules for Playing upon a Continued Bass , which was the first work of the kind issued in England . Some of his Latin hymns were printed in Cantica Sacra , 1674 , in Harmonica Sacra , , 1688 and 1714 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Choice Ayres and Dialogues , in 1676 , in The Theater of Musick , 1687 . Many of his anthems and much of his instru-mental music is in MS. , some preserved in the Library of the Sacred Harmonic Society . ' He died in 1677 . Lock helped as much as any one of his time to prepare the way for a more extended appreciation of instrumental music than had existed . Regarded by the light of the knowledge and opportunities composers in those days possessed , Matthew Lock was by no means one of the least important of that group of great musicians which included Michael Wise , Pelham Humfrey , John Blow , and Henry Purcell . Lock lived long enough to have marked the budding of the genius of the latter , though he could not witness its fruition . Before making particular mention of Michael Wise and his contemporaries , a word or two may be spared to tell of the lives and labours of those who strove to mend thr-gaps in Church music before " th6w four bright boys appeared . " Among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to furnish a text-book as a guide to the observance of choral worship , at a time when the Ritual of the Church of England was publicly restored after having been prohibited for nearly twenty years . // CHAPTER VIII . JOHN BARNARD , EDWARD LOWE , HENRY COOI , JAMES CLIFFORD , HENRY ALDRICH , ROBERT CREYGHTON , THOMAS TUDWAY . As the events of political history of the seventeenth century are well known , it is scarcely necessary to do more than make allusion to the hiatus in Cathedral music during the time of the Commonwealth . A recital of the acts and deeds of the superior powers as directed against Church music generally , and Cathedral worship in particular , would belong properly to the domain of history rather than to that of biography . The spirit of destruction which seized those who obtained the upper hand extended itself throughout the length and breadth of the land . The choirs were silenced , the singers dispersed , the organs broken down , the pipes sold for pots of ale , the books rent in pieces and scattered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " the beauty of holiness " was destroyed in a frenzy of " zeal , " as it was called , but which could only be so if it is the nature of zeal to express itself in wanton mischief and senseless violence . It is owing to this that all Church books anterior to this date , as well as the copies of Barnard 's collection of Church music are so extremely scarce . No perfect copy of Barnard is known to exist in any one possession . It was printed in 1641 , just before the // troubles broke out , and its very newness , and , to a certain extent , its bright and comely appearance ? for the printing was very good ? may have hastened its ruin . The compiler ? the L'ev . John Barnard ? though no composer , was a practical musician . He held the office of minor canon in St. Paul 's Cathedral , and in that capacity had to take part in singing the service , as was the custom for all the minor canons to do until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge which fitted him for the task he had set himself . None of the writers of his own time were included in this collection . Their works were to be reserved for a second series , which , however , never say the light . It was published in 1.641 with the title of The first Book of Selected Church Musick , consisting of Services and Anthems , such as are now used in the Cathedral and Collegiat Churches of this Kingdome . Never before printed . Whereby such Bookes as were heretofore with much di.lTicadty and Charges transcribed , for the use of the ( wire , are now to the Saving of much labour and Expence publisht for the general good of all such as shall desire them either for public or private exercise . Collecled out of divers approved Authors . The book was printed . in ten separate parts , medius , first and second contratenors , tenor , and bassus , for the Decani and Cantoris sides of the choir . " There was apparently no organ part . The several books were so arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests until its own turn carne . This may have secured attention on the part of the singers , but it could not insure accuracy of performance . The library of // Hereford Cathedral possesses , at the present time , eight out of the ten parts , and the library of the Sacred Harmonic Society another set of nine parts . Among the contents are services by Tallis , Birde , 0 . Gibbons , Mundy , Parsons , Morlev , Warde , Dr. Gyles , Woodson , Bevin , and Strogers ; and anthems both full and verse , by Batten , Hooper , White , J. Shepheard , Dr. Bull , Weelkes , and Tye , in addition to others by the first seven named composers of services . With the destruction of the books used in the service came a certain amount of oblivion as to the old forms . When a time of settlement after the turmoil arrived , the older musicians were dead , and many of the younger had adopted fresh , pursuits . Few organs existed , and still fewer organists , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily found employment , and the more expert were able to command good salaries . Deans and Chapters , and rulers of collegiate establishments , became for a time liberal to others besides their own body , quieting the questioning sort among themselves with the assurance that the large sums paid were " little enough for men of such quality at a time when good organists were scarce . " The Cathedral churches , since the time of the suppression of the monasteries , had been the only seminaries for the instruction of youth in the principles of music ; and as not only the revenues appropriated for this purpose were sequestered , but the very institution itself was declared to be superstitious , parents were deprived both of the means and the motives to qualify their children for choral duty , so that boys were // wanting to perform those parts of the service which required treble voices . Nay , to such straits were they driven , that for a twelvemonth after the Resto ration the clergy were forced to supply the want of boys by cornets ( wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had feigned voices . In consequence thereof , and of that inaptitude which follows the disuse of any faculty , when the Church service was revived there were very few found who could perform it . l At the request of the University of Oxford , Edward Lowe compiled A Short Direction for the perform ance of Cathedral Service . Published for the infor mation of such Persons as are Ignorant of it and shall be call 'd to officiate in Cathedral or Collegiate Churches where it bath formerly been in use . Three years later he issued a Review of his Short Directions , in which he adapted his original instructions to the newly adopted Prayer-book of 1662 , and included several chants and a Burial Service , set by John Parsons . This second edition was reprinted as a separate work by Dr. Rimbault , in 1843 , and was included in Choral Responses , 1857 , by Dr. Jebb . His directions have been for the most part superseded , and none of his Church music is now performed , but these facts do not impair the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music in his lifetime . He died July 11 , 1682 , and was buried in the Cathedral where he had served faithfully for more than half a century . His book of Directions was the third work of its kind published in England ; Mar-beck 's Books of Common Praier noted , 1550 , and John // Daye 's Certaine notes , in 1560 , being the other two . Since these books nothing of the kind has been given forth by authority , and this may account for the diversity of " uses " in our several cathedrals . The restoration of the Service marks an entirely new era in Church music in England . From this date , it may be noticed that there was a greater variety of key tonalities employed in the compositions than before . The old modes were kept in the background , if not actually discarded , and only employed for the sake of imparting an archaic effect to the music . New chord combinations were attempted , new effects suggested . A dramatic element , if the emphasis imparted to words by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was introduced , at first sparingly , and afterwards daringly . The attempts made , not meeting with any opposition , were held to have received approval . A more sprightly form of melody was cultivated , yet the division between sacred and secular music became more marked and distinct . Music did not , however , make so rapid a progress , or develop power so quickly , that the space of difference between the music for the Church and that for the Stage , in those days the only concert-room , precluded the possibility of an occasional contact , so that the one might , under certain conditions , be taken for the other . But the resources became extended when the combinations of voices and instruments were studied and recognised as valuable and powerful factors in the sum of development . Nothing in art is of sudden appearance . No new form of ideas starts fully grown and ready // armed , as Minerva is said to have originated . Everything is of slow growth , and though some things may take unexpected shapes , all can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three great geniuses in music who followed the period of the Restoration , Wise , Humfrey , and Blow , are the natural sequence of the long period of preparation which preceded them . The field of art had lain fallow during the Interregnum , and when the soil was new ploughed it gave forth abundance of fresh and vigorous forms , strengthened by the long period of unproductive rest . It is strange that these three , the first of the Children of the Chapel after the service was restored to former uses , should have become so famous in the world of music only to be superseded by Henry Purcell , one who " coining after was preferred before them . " All were children in 1660 . Purcell an infant in arms , or at the best just learning to exercise independent powers of locomotion . Wise , Humfrey , and Blow not more than twelve years old each . Wise , a droll , witty , yet passionate child ; Humfrey , delicate in health , but " mighty self-conceited ; " and Blow , gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had himself been a chorister in the Chapel Royal , and when his voice changed he abandoned music for a time and entered the army . When the Rebellion broke out in 1642 , he , being then about thirty years of age , obtained a captain 's commission , and from that time was always afterwards distinguished by his military title . At the time when King Charles the Second ascended the throne , Cook , who had resumed the practice of music , was one of // those men of the profession who , as Torn Brown says , " hung between the church and the playhouse , like Mahomet 's tomb between two loadstones . " He was appointed Master of the Children in 1660 , and although he is by no means famous for any of his musical productions in writing , for all that they are very commendable , his merit as a teacher must have been great . Burney says that Cook composed the music for the king 's coronation , but that none of his sacred music was ever printed . Anthony Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself supplanted in reputation and favour by his pupil Pelham Humfrey . But Anthony Wood tells so many stories that are not quite true , that everything he proposes must be received with a certain reservation . Cock must have been nearly , if not over , sixty years of age at the time of his death . Men who have been soldiers , and have learned to smile at fortune 's frowns , and who , like he , have enjoyed high patronage and ultimate success , do not always die of grief when near the grand climacteric . Besides , it is not easy to see the reason of any jealousy , unless it arose from a contemplation of powers he never possessed . Humfrey was esteemed because he was a composer . Cook never laid claim to much distinction as a writer . Humfrey was an excellent organist and " harpsicon " player . Cook played the lute , and enjoyed the best reputation in that capacity in his days and through all his life . Therefore , the story of the cause of his death , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be taken cum gran salis . The words of several anthems by Cook are inserted in the second edition // of Clifford 's Anthem Book , 1664 ; but the music is en tirely lost . The first edition of this work was printed in 1663 , under the title of Divine Services and Anthems , usually sang in the Cathedrals and Collegiate Choires in the Church of England , by J. C. James Clifford . This was the first collection of words of anthems published in London . The compiler was born in 1622 in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen , in Oxford ) . He was admitted as chorister in Magdalen College Chapel in 1632 , and resigned in 1642 , when he was in his twentieth year , but took no degree in the university . He became or dained in 1660 , and was made one of the minor canons of St. Paul 's Cathedral on July 1st , 1661 . " He was made senior cardinal in 1682 , was also reader in the church of St. Gregory by St. Paul 's near Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaplain to the Honourable Society of Sergeants ' Inn , near Fleet Street , London . " He died about the year 1700 . It is remarkable to note that at the time of the Re storation there were very few English Church composers alive and at work . Matthew Lock gave his attention chiefly to music for the stage when he did write , and being a Papist would not contribute anything for the service of the Church in which he was educated but had now deserted . William Childe of Windsor was over sixty years of age , discouraged if not broken down in spirit by the long neglect of the Church 's institutions , and the rapacious greed of its re-established // ministers ; and Benjamin Rogers , at that time at Eton , had acquired the somewhat settled habits of a man of forty-six , and probably neglected the art of composition as he is known to have neglected his college duties . There was no composer of note representing English ecclesiastical musical art worthier than Rogers , who might have been a great man had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dead , but it was dormant , and as the need for a supply of music fit for the wants of the Church existed and was pressing , adaptations from foreign composers were supplied for the ' first time . Dean Aldrich of Christ Church , Oxford , probably the first amateur of his time , was moved to an endeavour to meet this demand . There are many volumes of music from foreign authors , Palestrina , Carissimi , Vittoria , and others , with English words of his own finding , still preserved in the library of Christ Church to which he bequeathed them . He was a good scholar and a fair musician , but he was one of those clever men who spread themselves over too wide a surface to be able to cover any particular spot more than respectably . He wrote much music which has been accepted as original , but which imparts only a satellite-like reflection of the greater suns in whose light he was for ever basking . He produced an annotated edition of the Greek Classics . In distant imitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own college , built the chapel of Trinity College , and the Church of All Saints in High Street . His name is perpetuated in Oxford by a treatise on " Logic , " // and , in addition to the architectural monstrosities alluded to , by his passion for smoking tobacco . Out of the region of his Alma Mater he is remembered as the author of a service in G , written on the model of Gibbons and Tallis , and by a round , Hark , the bonny Christ Church bells , which finds its way persistently into cheap collections of music , but which few ever sing , or few have heard sung . His adaptations were made at a time when English Church music as represented by Humfrey , Blow , and Purcell was asserting itEelf in a new direction and needed all possible encouragement . The production of the works by the Italian musicians , unqnestionably noble efforts , were not made with a view to their use or employment by other churches than those for which they were composed . The antique forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented , were equally well if not better displayed in the works by English writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , which it now became almost a fashion to neglect , and to dispraise in favour of everything of a foreign origin . The distrust in English musical art began from this date , and notwithstanding the fact that Henry Purcell was born , lived , laboured , and died in the space of time during which Dean Aldrich enjoyed the full maturity of his powers , the prejudice against English music was not removed by the works of our great composer , probably because Aldrich was in a position to influence those who , in turn , influenced popular opinion . Dean Henry Aldrich was born in 1646 , and died in 1710 . Another clerical . musician who lived at this period , // Dr. Robert Creyghton , of Wells , is remarkable for having introduced more sprightly phrases into his Church music than it had been the wont to do before . He was also credited with having written much of his music in triple measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church writers . " This is not quite correct , as there are several pieces by the older musicians in which this " time " measure is employed . Orlando Gibbons used triple measure in his services , and other pieces for sacred use . Creyghton was an excellent amateur , and had acquired considerable knowledge of music while in exile with King Charles II. , but he made no new discoveries in music . He used the skill he possessed with judgment and taste , as his services and anthems show , particularly , I will arise , among the latter , which is in canon form . He was perhaps the first who employed the key of E flat in Church music if , as it is said , he wrote the service in that key associated with his name , soon after his appointment as Greek professor at Cambridge in 1662 . He was canon and precentor of Wells Cathedral in 1674 , and died at the age of ninety-seven in that city in the year 1736 . A short account of another minor light in music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made an attempt to collect the anthems of the old English writers at the request of Edward , Lord Harley , and succeeded in scoring as many as fill some half a dozen volumes which are now in the British Museum . It is said that he was one of those called the second set of children educated at the Chapel Royal under Dr. Blow , but the statements made concerning him do not agree // the one with the other . Blow was not appointed to any place in the Chapel Royal , except that of chorister , until March , 1674 , and did not hold the office of master of the boys until the death of Pelham Humfrey a few months later . Hawkins , who says that Tudway was a pupil of Blow , also says that on the 22nd of April , 1664 , he was admitted to sing tenor at St. George 's , Windsor . It is hardly possible that he should have grown into a child and found his treble voice again to become the pupil of Blow at the Chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be assumed that he was one of the fellow-choristers of Blow , but a year or two older than he , certainly not younger . He was by no means possessed of like ability . He was appointed organist at King 's College in Cambridge in 1671 , three years before Blow became once more attached to the Chapel Royal . In 1681 he graduated Bachelor of Music , and in 1705 , when Queen Anne visited the University , he was made Doctor , and Professor of music in succession to Dr. Staggins , the first professor of music in the University , who had held the honour since 1684 . The post was at that time without emolument . Dr. Tudway was called composer and organist extraordinary to Queen Anne . The titles might have been reversed with propriety , for the two or three songs and catches , which are in print with his name attached thereto , and the multitude of his effusions which are not , prove him to have been an extraordinary composer , but without the power of extending a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike to the introduction of passages of fugal imitation in vocal music , on the ground that // they obscured the sense of the words , his music is like chaff for dryness , and unlike chaff for heaviness . He was a man of little ability but of a " shrewd wit , " if a passion for punning can be so distinguished . His singular style of conversation , " however , did not lose him any friends , and though it could not succeed in making him a great musician , it helped to secure for him many personal comforts and , strange to say , also a good share of the world 's respect . He died in 1730 . He was not accurate as an historian , for in his manuscript collection of anthems he states that one by Tallis , Discomfit them , 0 Lord , was made for the victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 , three years after Tallis was dead . He also affirms that the service in F by Gibbons was written in 1635 , at which time Gibbons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to the club anthem of Turner , Blow , and Humfrey , will be examined in the notice of the life of the latter . Thomas Tudway 's chronology and the dates concerning him , seem to be capable of , if not to demand , revision . CHAPTER IX . MICHAEL WISE , PELHAM HUMFREY , HENRY PURCELL , JOHN BLOW , WILLIAM TURNER , JEREMIAH CLARK . WISE , Hum frey , and Blow , were among the first set of Children of the Chapel when the service of the Church of England was restored , with the return // of King Charles in 1660 . They were all born about the same time , 1647 or 1648 , and it may be supposed that they were selected from among others , not because they promised to be good singers , but because they already had had some training and were fairly well skilled in music . Michael Wise was born at Salisbury , and it may be assumed that he obtained some instruction in his early days in the Cathedral there . At the Chapel Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of having Pelham Humfrey and John Blow as his fellow students . ' Wise was nominated organist and master of the choristers at the Cathedral in his native city in 1668 , he being then , as was supposed , in his twentieth year . In July , 1675 , he was appointed to the place of a gentleman in the Chapel Royal , and in 1686 became vicar-choral and almoner of St. Paul 's , the latter office carrying with it the office of master of the choristers . King Charles was wont to favour Michael Wise , who being appointed to attend the Royal progresses , claimed as king 's organist the privilege of playing to His Majesty on the organ , at whatever church he went , whether the instrument was good , bad , or of no quality at all . By this it may be inferred that Wise had a great notion of the importance of his office . He was not an unpleasant man , according to all accounts , hut he must have been subject to fits of ungovernable passion , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that he was killed in a street fray at - r. alisbnry , by the watchmen , in 1687 . Tli // more accurate account of the matter is this : " He had quarrelled with his wife on some trivial matter , and rushed out of his house . The watchman met him while he was yet boiling with rage , and commanding him to stand and give an account of himself , he struck the guardian of the peace to the ground , who in return aimed a blow at his assailant with his bill , which broke his skull , of the consequence whereof he died . " In his anthems and services Wise exhibits no little genius . Of a lively fancy and quick imagination in himself , his music reflects his disposition , not because it is lively ? for as a rule , he is must successful in the expression of the sorrowful and pathetic , as in The Ways of Zion , and Prepare ye the Way of the Lord ? but because of the passionate accent with which the sentiments are expressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , For these things 1 weep , and in the second , the dramatic power expressed in the duet for trebles , And the Voice said , Cry , is equal with anything ever attempted in the way of expression in sacred music . Written more than two hundred years ago , these passages are as fresh as if newly given forth from the brain of the most tender and expressive among modern musicians . In the generality of his compositions , not only do we find the most earnest endeavour to give in music the full meaning of particular passages , but those passages are made part of a picturesque whole , in which religious sentiment and utterance are enforced by means of beautiful melody and vivid harmony . One of the faults belonging to the age , and especially notable in his music , is the frequency with which he uses the " perfect cadence " // at the conclusion of a sentence . In the works of all the Church writers before him , this seems to have been avoided , and the plagal cadence preferred . Wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him from Lully , who acquired it from the study of Carissimi . It was with him as a new toy , with which he constantly played . His fellow pupil , Pelham Humphrey , Humphreys , or Humfrey , as he occasionally signed his name , was born in 1647 , and was said to be a nephew of Colonel John Humphrey , a noted Cromwellian , and Bradshaw 's sword-bearer ; he began to compose while he was yet a chorister , for in the second edition of Clifford 's book , Divine Services and Anthems , 1664 , there are the words of five of ' the anthems by Pelham Humfrey , one of the Children of His Majesty 's Chapel . " The club anthem , " I will always give thanks , so-called because it was the joint composition of Humfrey , Blow , and Turner , was probably written during these early years . Dr. Tudway , with his customary chronological inaccuracy , says it was written to celebrate a naval victory over the Dutch in 1665 . This could not have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner was modest and retiring in his disposition ; Humfrey , wild and quick ; Blow , good-natured and conciliatory . Dr. Boyce , when he stated that the anthem was written as a. memorial of friendship and fraternal esteem by the young composers , probably spoke with authority . Humfrey wrote the first part , Blow the concluding movement , and Turner the bass solo . When in the course of nature Humfrey was no longer able to // sing in the choir , the ability be exhibited prompted the king to send him to France , there to improve himself under Lully . The king had already encouraged his musicians to compose anthems of a brisk and lively fashion , with symphonies and ritornells " between , to be played upon viols , cornets , and sacbuts , in the organ loft , " but he rightly thought that if he could have young Humfrey educated in the mode of France , his own genius , tempered with the knowledge he could gain , would be decidedly to the augmentation of his own pleasure . Accordingly , in 1664 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to defray the charges of his journey , and he received in the two years following , 1001. and 1501. respectively . He remained for the most of his time in Paris and studied under Lully . When he returned in October , 1667 , he found he had been appointed , in his absence , to the place in the Chapel made vacant by the death of Thomas Hazzard . The new pieces he had brought with him were greatly admired , as they deserved to be . He had learnt to be skilful in the art of scoring , and his own genius had become developed , so that he was able to produce anthems which are to this day models of beauty in expression , of striking emphasis in the words , and an apt and happy union of sound and sense . Much of this must be attributed to his own genius , and perhaps something may be owing to the influence of his master , Henry Cook . Such of Cook 's songs as are extant are marked by characteristic taste and expression , sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expand , more especially those who were compelled to work , as there is no doubt Cook 's boys were . His // military experience would have led him to insist upon implicit obedience , and the habits of the time which made children submissive through fear to parents and superiors , compelled them to fulfil their tasks in order to avoid punishment . That these " first children of the Chapel " must have worked hard , the events of the career of each in after life tend to prove . Wise was organist of a Cathedral at the age of twenty , Humfrey a gentleman of the King 's Chapel and a recognised composer at nineteen , and Blow organist of Westminster Abbey at the age of twenty-one . The story of Henry Cook dying of grief because one of his boys was successful is hard of belief . Still less credible is it that he should have felt chagrined because three of them excelled him in composition . He was , if human nature was the same then as it is now , proud of his pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he was grieved at anything , it would have been to see Master Pelham , as Pepys calls him , grown so conceited with airing the modish French ways he had acquired during his sojourn in Paris with " Master Lully , of the Grand Monarch 's Chapel . " Humfrey had been sent out with good credentials to the Court of France , and for the sake of his master , the King of England , who was very partial to him , he was doubtless well treated . He had been furnished with ample funds out of the secret service money , and being vain , conceited , and fond of pleasure , had improved his opportunities for cultivating his appreciation of himself . He had learned something from Lully , and as Dr. Hullah observes in his lectures on the Transition . Period of Musical , // History , had formed his style , though at second hand , on that of Carissimi , for Lully had had the good sense or good fortune to form his style on that of the great Italian master ; unquestionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy of fourteen young Humfrey had distinguished himself as a composer . Pepys , in his Diary , tells us , Nov. 22 , 1663 : " The anthem was good after sermon , being the fifty-first Psalme , made for five voices by one of Captain Cooke 's boys , a pretty boy , and they say there are four or five of them that can do as much . " This anthem is probably the one printed in Boyce 's Collection . Once more we read , under date Nov. 1 , 1667 : " To chapel , it being All Hallows Day , and heard a fine anthem made by Master Pelham , who is come over . " Finally , the following implied estimate of the behaviour of Master Pelham is as bright and vivid a picture of character and humour , and vraisemblance , as one of Barnard 's book illustrations : " Nov. 15 , 1667 . Home , and there find as I expected , Mr. Caesar and little Pelham Humfreys , lately returned from France , and is an absolute monsieur , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything and everybody 's skill but his own . But to hear how he laughs at all the king 's musick here , as Blagrave and others , that they can not time nor tune , nor understand anything ; and the Grebus , the Frenchman , the king 's master of the musick , how he understands nothing , nor can play on any instrument , and so can not compose , and that he will give him a lift out of his place ; and that he and the king are mighty great . " // Notwithstanding his conceit , Humfrey was a max of genius , and the new forms of composition he introduced into Church music became the models for future following . To quote Dr. Mullah 's words from the same work alluded to above : " In place of the overlapping phrases of the old masters , growing out of one another like the different members of a Gothic tower , we have masses of harmony subordinated to one rhythmical idea ; in place of sustained and lofty flights we have shorter and more timorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divergencies ; and in lieu of repetition or presentation of a few passages under different circumstances , a continually varying adaptation of music to changing sentiment of words , and the most fastidious observance of their emphasis and quantity . It would be easy to point out the faults in Pelham Humphrey 's music , as in all the music of his time , but the faults were at least counterbalanced by the beauties , which were once novelties as well as beauties , and which must ever remain beauties , though to us they have lost their companion charm . " As already stated , Humfrey was appointed Gentleman of the Chapel Royal on January 24 , 1666-7 , and sworn into his place on the 26th October in the same year after his return from France . He became Master of the Children after Cook in 1672 . In the same year , on 8th August , he was made , conjointly with Thomas Purcell , the uncle of the famous Henry , " Composer is ordinary for the violins to His Majesty , " at which time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on a row , " which had been set up // in imitation of " Les petits Violon.s " conducted in Paris by Lully , and many anthems with instrumental accompaniments , some of which are printed , but without the orchestral parts , in Boyce 's collection . There are many of his anthems and services still in MS. in various cathedrals . All his compositions are notable for the expression they contain , and for many new combinations of chords not before introduced . The sharp fifth as a passing note , the major third and minor sixth on a bass note , a sequence of imperfect fifths , and the augmented , or , as it was called , the extreme sharp sixth , as well as the flat third and sharp fourth , all new to church music , were employed by him for the first time . He also indulged in " extreme keys , " for he writes boldly not only in C minor but actually in F minor . It is therefore not at all inconsistent with reason to suppose that his violinists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to temper their scales at will . The sound of these keys on the organs of that date would not have been pleasant . Some of his songs were printed after his death in Choice Ayres , Songs , and Dialogues , 1676-84 ; in Harmonia Sacra , 1714 , and other collections . He is said to have written many of the words of the songs set by the composers of , his time , and to have had as " fanciful a wit as he had a delicate hand on the lute . " He died at Windsor , July 14th , 1674 , in his twentyseventh year , and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey , near the south-east door . It is sad to think that his life may possibly have been shortened by indulgence in the temptations the // age offered , and which he had not the strength of will to resist . But short as his life was , perhaps shorter than that of any musician recorded in history , his genius was great , and its influence over art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted his forms of expression and employed his discoveries . His ideas were further expounded by Croft , Weldon , Clark , and others even so late as the time of Maurice Greene . He was the first master of England 's great musician , Henry Purcell . Of this last-named genius a mere sketch must suffice , as his life and labours have been exhaustively treated by Mr. W. H. Cummings in one of the books in the series to which the present work belongs . Purcell was born in 1658 , was admitted into the Chapel Royal at the age of six years , became organist of Westminster Abbey in 1675 , in his eighteenth year , and died in 1695 . John Blow , Purcell 's second master , was born in 1648 , at North Collingham , Nottinghamshire , a village about five miles from Newark , and eight from Southwell . It is supposed that he received the rudiments of his musical education at home , probably from some musician connected either with Southwell or Lincoln . At the age of twelve years he became one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretended that the ancient system of impressing choristers was resorted to in order to refurnish the Chapel with boys ' voices , though the king 's prerogative remained unimpaired , but it is possible that the best boys from various cathedral centres were selected to make // up the number required . That the musicians of the old establishments were striving to earn a living by the exercise of their profession is well known , even though no vestige of the old form of worship , nor any sort of musical service , was being performed at the cathedrals and collegiate churches during the interregnum . It would be impossible otherwise to account for the extraordinary ability exhibited by these " first boys of the Chapel , " if they commenced their musical education after they had been selected , and at a time when a disposition for work is difficult to create . The words of certain anthems given by Clifford , prove that young Blow 's compositions were even then considered worthy of performance ; yet when the book was published he could only have been in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some amount of musical knowledge , acquired in an unknown place , in an undetermined manner , before he came to London . It has been stated that John Hingston , organist to Oliver Cromwell , gave young John Blow lessons upon the organ ; these he continued afterwards with Christopher Gibbons : , one of the sons of Orlando Gibbons . It then remains to inquire was Hingston ever at Newark , Lincoln , or Southwell ? If not , where could young Blow have received instruction from him ? Certain it is that , whoever were his masters , he profited greatly by the lessons he obtained , so much so that in 1669 he was appointed organist of Westminster Abbey . This post he held for eleven years , when he resigned it to make room for Henry Purcell , his pupil . In 1674 ( March 16th ) he was sworn // in as gentleman of the Chapel in the place of Roger Hill , and on the death of Pelham Humfrey in the same year , was appointed master of the children . In the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel , holding at the same time the place of organist of St. Margaret 's , Westminster . He was one of the deputies at St. Paul 's Cathedral , and in 1689 became Almoner and Vicar-Choral , both of which posts he is said to have resigned in 1693 in favour of Jeremiah Clark , who had been his pupil , thus for the second time yielding as it were to his own children . In 1699 the office of composer to the Chapel Royal , at the suggestion of Dr. Tillotson , at that time Dean of St. Paul 's , was instituted , and Blow received the first appointment , with a salary of forty pounds a year . Hawkins says of him , that he was " a very handsome man in his person , and remarkable for a gravity and decency in his deportment suited to his station , though he seems by some of his compositions to have been not altogether invincible to the delights of a convivial hour . He was a man of blameless morals , and of a benevolent temper ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be totally free from the imputation of pride . Such as would form a true estimate of his character as a musician , must have recourse to his compositions for the Church , his services and anthems , which afford abundant reason to say of Dr. Blow , that among Church musicians he has few equals and scarce any superior . " There is a story related on the authority of Mr. Samuel Weely , a scholar of Blow 's and of Brand 's , one // of the vicars-choral of St. Paul 's , with reference to one of Blow 's anthems . In the latter part of the year 1688 , King James , having heard a composition by an Italian musician , asked Blow if he could equal it , which Blow undertook to do , and by All Saints ' Day had completed the anthem , " I beheld and lo . " The king sent Father Petre to express his very great approval of the composition , which message was duly delivered with an addendum of the Jesuit 's own . " For myself , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his usual gravity and decency in deportment , replied , " That is the opinion of but one fool , and I heed it not . " Father Petre with malicious vengefulness prevailed upon his majesty to suspend Blow , but the flight of the king removed the suspension . Blow owed his title of doctor in music to Sancroft , Archbishop of Canterbury , and very few who have received that distinction have deserved it more . This was the only honour conferred upon him in his lifetime , unless the fact of the performance of his " Gloria Patri , " to Latin words , in the Pope 's chapel be true , and considered as such . Mr. Husk in his account of Blow , in Grove 's Dictionary , says that Blow was a voluminous composer , his works comprise fourteen Church Services , and upwards of one hundred Anthems , nearly the whole of which are still extant , although but few are in print . They also include Sacred Songs , Duets , &c.; ( many of which are printed in Playford 's Flarmonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's Day , 1682 , 1683 , 1686 , 1687 , 1688 , 1689 , 1693 ? , 1694 , and 1700 ; Odes for St. Cecilia 's Day , 1684 printed , 1691 , and 1700 , besides two which can not // be assigned to any particular year ; Ode written by Dryden on the death of Purcell , 1695 ; Songs ( with which the various collections of the period abound ) ; Catches , ( many of them printed in " The Catch-Club , " The Pleasant Musical Companion , 1724 , and other collections ) ; Organ pieces ; Lessons for the Harpsichord , 1698 printed and 1705 printed with some by Purcell . In 1700 Blow published , by subscription , a collection of his songs , &c.,; under the title of Amphion Anglicus , with his portrait prefixed . In the preface to this work he expressed his intention of publishing his church music , but unfortunately never accomplished his purpose , a circumstance much to be regretted , since it is upon those productions that his fame chiefly rests . Three services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He died October 1 , 1708 , and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey . On his tombstone is engraved , on an open book , the canon set to the words of the " Gloria Patri " in his " Gamut " service . The inscription on the monument concludes with these words : " His own musical compositions , especially his church musick , are a far nobler monument to his memory than any other that can be raised for him . " The truth of this statement no unprejudiced musician can deny . Blow 's fellow pupil , William Turner , was one among the youngest of the first children of the Chapel , not one of the second set , as Hawkins , and Burney who copied from him , both state . They each say that Turner was a pupil of Blow 's , and Burney , after repeating that statement , quotes that veracious and logical historian Dr. Tudway in manner conformable , for he says that the // Club Anthem with orchestral accompaniments written by Humfrey , Blow , and Turner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charles the Second , at a very short notice , on account of a victory at sea over the Dutch . It is not worth while to refute this statement . The anthem exists , and was unques tionably written by the three boys , Humfrey , Blow , and Turner . The career of the two former has been traced , it only remains to add a few words concerning William Turner . His life was long , but it was placid and comparatively uneventful . When his voice broke he sang counter-tenor , and such a quality of voice being unusual if not rare , he found no difficulty in obtaining places in the Chapel hoyal , Westminster Abbey , and St. Paul 's Cathedral , all of which he held simultaneously , a system of pluralism permitted by the authorities , the hours at which the services were held being to some extent arranged to accommodate the singers . He was admitted Doctor of Music in the University of Cambridge by accumulation in 1696 . He died on the 13th day of January , 1739-40 , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloisters of Westminster Abbey , together with his wife Elizabeth , who died four days before him . They had been married nearly seventy years , and in their relation exhibited to the world an illustrious example of conjugal virtue and felicity . Their only daughter was married to John Robinson , organist of Westminster // Abbey , and the composer of the double chant in E flat which is printed in Boyce 's collection . One of the most personally-popular musicians of his day was Jeremiah , familiarly called Jerry , Clark . He was one of Blow 's pupils , and so great a favourite with his master that it is said that he vacated his place as almoner and vicar-choral at St. Paul 's Cathedral in 1693 , in order that Clark might be appointed . As the appointment to tuese offices rests entirely with the dean and chapter of the Cathedral , it is possible that there is another version of this story as yet untold . It may be that the story was made up after the circum-stance that Clark was appointed to the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days , were very jealous of their privileges , and would not be likely to permit any arrangement such as is here suggested . In 1695 Clark was sworn into the full place of a vicar-choral after probation , and on July 7th , 1700 , he , with William Croft , received the appointment of gentleman extraordinary at the Chapel Royal , with joint reversion to the place of organist when it should fall vacant , which it did in 1704 , on the death of Francis Pigott . ' , As a composer , Clark deserves a good place in the ranks of English church musicians , though his works are not numerous . His anthems , " I will love Thee , 0 Lord , " and " Praise the Lord , " are still great favourites , the one for the trustful simplicity of its pathetic sentences , the other for the quaint and lively // though not undignified character of its themes . He wrote many harpsichord lessons , which have been printed , some of the music for The Island Princess , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " besides a number of songs scattered abroad in many collections . The grace and tenderness of his ideas often counterbalance the lack of scientific construction in his works . He is always expressive , but rarely exhibits great dignity . According to some accounts he acquired a sad and brooding disposition , and this made him take seriously to heart his rejection by a lady for whom he had formed an attachment . It is said that she was in a condition of life far above his own , and that in a passion of despair he killed himself . " Being at the house of a friend in the country , he took an abrupt resolution to return to London ; his friend having observed in his manner marks of great dejection , furnished him with a horse and a servant . Riding along the road , a fit of melancholy seized him , upon which he alighted , and giving the servant his horse to hold , went into a field , in a corner whereof was a pond , and also trees , and began a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hanging or drowning Not being able to resolve on either , he thought of making what he looked upon as chance the umpire , and drew out of his pocket a piece of money , and tossing it into the air , it came down on its edge and stuck in the clay ; though the declaration answered not his wish , it was far from ambiguous , as it seemed to forbid both methods of destruction ; and would have given unspeakable comfort to a mind less dis ) rganised than his own . Being thus interrupted in his // purpose , he returned , and mounting his horse , rode on to London , and in a short time shot himself . " The books of the vicars-choral of St. Paul 's state that on " November ye first , Mr. Jerry Clarke deceased this life . " The year of his melancholy death was 1707 . The year of his age 38 . CHAPTER X. WILLIAM CROFT , JOHN CHURCH , JOHN GOLDWIN , JOHN WELDON , CHARLES KING . THE date of the death of Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art in England . One which , instituted independently of church music , was destined incidentally to affect it in course of time . The Church was slow to adopt the discoveries , if they may be so called , made in a new direction , until their novelty was in some sort worn off . So it arose that the secular style of the preceding half century became the ecclesiastical style of the present . This has continued to the year of grace now rolling on , and probably will endure until a further revolution in musical art takes place . It is therefore useless and needless to lament the inevitable . The new era now spoken of was commenced with the introduction of Italian opera into England , and the encouragement given to foreign productions in preference to English . Native art was almost entirely confined in its expression to church music , and out of the multitude of professors of music , // composers , and performers , there are only one or two names worthy of record as having shown any disposition towards working to maintain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Croft , Greene , and Boyce are the heroes most honourable in the list of church musicians during the first half of the eighteenth century . But there were many others worthy of the crown of parsley , if not of the bays or the olive , all having wrought well and earnestly for the cause of the art they represented , even though certain of their contemporaries were unwilling to agree that they should be so decorated . It was not their fault if the age in which they lived was one in which true art had been left to struggle for itself , uncared for by those who ought to have cherished it ; that all artistic feeling had been deadened by unsympathetic treatment . Even the sister arts of adornment and design were reduced to the expression of the barest , crudest , and most uncomely fashions not only in dress but in domestic ornament . When we contemplate the artificiality which encompassed every expression - of a poetical character , it is all the greater wonder that men should have been found who were sufficiently true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings . The people of that age were uncertain in their loyalty , indifferent in their allegiance to the institutions of the Church , and suspicious of each other . It was therefore no happy time for musical art , which requires for its free exercise , a perfect confidence established between the giver and the receiver . Of those who // laboured for art 's sake , and in the face of discourage ? ment from the Church at this date , the earliest and perhaps the chief was William Croft . He was born at Nether or Lower Eatington in Warwickshire , a village about five miles from the birthplace of Shakespeare , and only otherwise famous in history as the place at which George Fox the quaker made his first essay at preaching . Croft , or Crofts , as he called himself and was sometimes called , was admitted to the Chapel Royal as a chorister about the year 1685 under Dr. Blow , who recommended him in 1699 to the place of organist to the Church of St. Anne 's , Soho , then newly built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he resigned , and his pupil John Ishatn , who had acted as his deputy from time to time , was appointed in his place . On July 7th , 1700 , he was admitted as a gentleman extraordinary at the Chapel Royal , with the reversion , conjointly with Jeremiah Clark , to the organist 's place , which was shared , as by agreement , when Francis Pigott died , in 1704 May 25 . On the death of Clark in 1707 , Croft succeeded to the full place . In the year following , Dr. Blow , the organist of Westminster Abbey , died , and Croft was appointed to succeed him there . He also was appointed master of the children and composer to the Chapel Royal at the same time . On July 9th he accumulated the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor in Music at Oxford , and his exercise was afterwards published with two odes in English and Latin , written for the Peace of Utrecht , under the title of " Musicus Apparatus Academicus . " In the same // year an addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four gentlemen , a second composer , a lutanist , and a violist . Dr. Croft was also allowed eighty pounds a year more as master of the children , " to teach them to read , write , and to cast accompts , and to play upon the organs , and to compose music . " In the year 1724 he published , by subscription , a collection of thirty anthems and a burial-service in score , under the title of " Musica Sacra . " This was the first publication of a number of anthems in score , nothing of this kind having been previously attempted , except a service of Purcell 's , which does not seem to have been well done ; " the faults and omissions are so gross as not to be amended but by some skilful hand . " The work was in two volumes , engraved and stamped on plates , and the burial service was a completion of one begun but not finished by Henry Purcell . In the preface to the collection , Croft states that he is " ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the same does not appear from any memorials or entries thereof in books remaining in any of our cathedral churches . " Croft 's anthems are full of dignity , solemnity of character , and freshness of thought , not always reaching the sublime , but never trivial or commonplace . It is true that some of his music is disfigured by the introduction of passages which recall the dance measures of the Suites or Sonatas , and are further marked by the weakness of the period ? the fondness for divisions . These latter may have been introduced to accommodate Mr. Elford , a counter-tenor singer whom he praises in his preface . // His anthems , " God is gone up , " " We will rejoice , " among others , still hold a high place in cathedral repertories . The magnificence and power of the " Gloria " to the " Jubilate , " in his service in A , has never been surpassed for point and emphasis . There are four of Croft 's anthems printed in Boyce 's collection , and there are others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes , two of which , St. Anne 's and St. Matthew 's , will live as long as music lives . Croft wrote music for the stage , overtures and act tunes , as for example Courtship a la Mode , 1700 ; The Funeral , 1702 ; The Twin Rivals , 1703 ; The Dying Lover , 1704 ; besides sonatas or suites for the harpsichord and violin , six solos for the flute and a bass . He died August 14th , 1727 ; but not , as Hawkins says , in consequence of a cold caught while attending the coronation of George II. , for that monarch was not crowned until nearly two months after Croft had been buried . He lies in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey , where a monument is erected to his memory . The inscription is in Latin . Translated it reads thus : " Near to this place lies interred William Croft , Doctor in Music , organist of the Royal Chapel and of this Collegiate Church . His harmony he derived from that excellent artist in modulation who lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , which for the most part he consecrated to God , he made a diligent progress ; nor was it by the solemnity of the numbers alone , but by the force of his ingenuity and the sweet ness of his manners , and even his countenance , that he // excellently recommended them . Having resided among mortals for fifty years , behaving with the utmost candour ( not more conspicuous for any other office of humanity than a friendship and love truly paternal to all whom he had instructed ) , he departed to the heavenly choir on the fourteenth day of August , 1727 , that , being near , he might add his own Hallelujah to the Concert of Angels . Awake up my glory , awake lute and harp , I myself will awake right early . " Croft is said to have helped Sir John Dolben , the sub-dean of the Chapel Royal , in the compilation of a book of words of anthems published in 1712 , with the title of Divine Harmony . The like honour is also claimed for John Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Westminster Abbey , and one of the vicars-choral of St. Paul 's . It is possible that both may have helped in the compilation . Church , who was born at Windsor in 1675 , was admitted as a chorister in St. John 's College , Oxford , in 1684 . When his voice broke he is said to have been appointed one of the singing men at Christ Church . a He left Oxford in June , 1697 , and was admitted to the full place of a gentleman of the Chapel Royal on August 1st in that year , in the room of James Cob or Cobb . He wrote many services and anthems , some of which are still in use , and an Introd action to Psalmody , 1723 , now become very scarce . He died January 5th , 1741 , and was buried in the south cloisters of Westminster Abbey . Hawkins does not mention his name in his History . He gives two lines only to Thomas Wanless . This was perhaps as much as he deserves , for he endeavoured // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing one of his own , the plain song of which was like the refrain of a ballad . His attempt was one of the instances of perverted taste which are characteristic of the period in which he lived . Wanless was born in 1676 , graduated Bachelor of Music at Cambridge in 1698 , was organist of York Minster , and died about 1725 . There were numerous attempts by inferior musicians to substitute for the recognised music of the Church the dross of their own devising . The quality of the music was degenerating . The stores of the Church were not always ill-supplied . There was quantity if not quality . Still there were faithful children , who sought to lay their best efforts as treasures at the service of their mother , and who seemed to be ever striving to make a distinction between their thoughts for sacred and secular music . One of these earnest and well-meaning musicians was John Goldwin , who succeeded his master , Dr. Childe , as organist at Windsor in 1697 . Some of his services and anthems are printed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Page 's Harmonia Sacra . " I have set God , " in Boyce , is melodious , earnest , and pleasing . There are some " lessons " of his in MS. which are bright and of a more advanced character than his sacred music . He died in 1719 . Another was John Weldon , despite what Dr. Burney says of him , namely , that " his productions appear flimsy after those of Croft 's . " Posterity does not seem inclined to endorse his opinion , nor can the faithful historian confirm it . John Weldon wrote some exceedingly beautiful music for the Church , in which deep religious // sentiment seems to have been his motive power . It is true he does not appear to have been able to free himself from the fashions of his time ; no man can , not even the greatest genius that ever was inspired . There is always some trick of expression , some form of utterance which identifies a man 's work with the age in which he lived and breathed . One method , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weldon 's day ; used in descending passages it was held to typify depression , in ascending passages , exaltation . Burney states that " it is a vice of which composers of small resources are often inadvertently guilty . " If , according to the same authority , the " eternal repetition of the same poor passage " be an evidence of poverty of invention , what would he have said of the thirteen reiterations of the scale passage in Mozart 's " Non piu andrai " ? Further , what would he have thought of Wagner 's music , iii which repetitions are employed with what we poor moderns are inclined to think is a good effect ? In defiance of the opinion of Dr. Burney , musicians of the present day hold that the man who could write such anthems as " Hear my crying , " " In Thee , 0 Lord " ( despite the duet , " Bow down Thine ear , " for alto and bass , which , in consequence of the manner in which it is occasionally sung by half-educated singers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 0 God , Thou hast cast us out , " and " Who can tell how oft he offendeth " ? all of which are in common use to this day , as well as a large number which are only occasionally heard ? must have been possessed not only of genius but of a sincerely religious frame of mind , sucn. // as ought to be brought to bear in the construction of music intended for continuous use in the church . These anthems , with one or two others , are for the most part independent of the fashion of the time when they were written , and though tinged by method of diction and manner of handwriting , so to speak , they will con tinue to live . There is evidence also that Weldon was an original thinker in music . In the anthem " Hear my crying , " which even Burney acknowledges to be a pleasing and masterly composition , the six-part writing is remarkable for its freedom and melodiousness , and in the concluding movement there is the earliest instance on record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augmented sixth . These sixths are of the family called , alternately , German , Italian , and Neapo litan , because they were discovered by an Englishman , and that Englishman John Weldon , whose " powers of invention and harmonical combination seem very much limited . " 1 Weldon was born at Chichester about the year 1679 . He was educated in the choir at Eton under John Walter , and is supposed to have been transferred to Westminster Abbey , for he was a pupil of Henry Purcell . He was appointed organist of New College , Oxford , in 1698 , and left there in 1700-1 ( January 6th ) to become a gentleman extraordinary of the Chapel Royal . He succeeded Dr. Blow as organist in 1708 . When the places of second composer in ordinary , lutan ist , and violist were made in 1715 , Weldon received the first-named appointment . His initial composition in // his new capacity was a setting of the Prefaces , " Sanctus " and " Gloria , " for the Communion Service , the first which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weldon also held the appointment of organist at St. Bride 's Church , Fleet Street , London , and also that of St. Martin 's in the Fields , in 1726 , given it is said out of compliment to the King , whose organist he was . The King had been elected churchwarden to the parish , and growing tired of his office after a service of two months , gave the parish an organ which cost ? 1,500 by way of solace for relinquishing his duties . Weldon wrote very little secular music . There are some single-sheet songs by him , printed at the end of the seventeenth or beginning of the eighteenth centuries , in the Mercuries IlPasicus , as well as separately , and some three collections of songs " performd at the Consort in York Buildings , and at y ? Theatre , as also Symphony Songs for Violins and Flutes , never before Publish 'd , Carefully corrected by y ? Author , " which were printed in score and published by Walsh . He also wrote the music for Congreve 's masque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of four prizes out of a sum of two hundred pounds " subscribed by several persons of quality for the best composition on this subject " . About the year 1720 Weldon published his Divine Harmony ; six select Anthems for a voice alone , with a Thorow-Bass , for the Organ , Harpsicord , or Arch-lute . There is in this book a picture representing the interior of St. James 's Chapel during the performance of Divine Service , in which the violists , lutanists , and " Hoboy // players " are performing left-handed . These anthems were written for Mr. Richard Elford , whom Dr. Croft praises so highly . Weldon died in the year 1736 , and was buried in the grave-yard of St. Paul 's , Covent Garden , the resting-place of many who in their lives were distinguished in literature and art . The stone which once marked the place of his burial has been removed . Charles King , whom Dr. Greene ? at first one of his boys , and afterwards one of his colleagues in St. Paul 's Cathedral ? was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " in allusion to the number of services he had written , next claims notice according to chrono-logical order . He was born in 1684 , was admitted as a chorister of St. Paul 's in his seventh year just before Dr. Blow resigned , so he earned the right to call him-self , and be called , a pupil of the famous doctor . He took the degree of Bachelor in Music at Oxford in 1704 , and was appointed deputy in St. Paul 's through the kind offices of Jeremiah Clark , whose sister he afterwards married . He succeeded to the place of Almoner and master of the boys on the death of Jeremiah Clark in 1707 , but was not sworn in as vicar choral until October 31st , 1730 . At this time he held the place of organist at the church of St. Benet Fink , by the Royal Exchange . Several of his anthems and services have been printed . There is no depth of thought in any of King 's music , and its continued employment in these days is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be , " serviceable . " He died March 17th , 1748 . He was very much liked for his per- // sonal character . The tradition handed down by the boys of St. Paul 's Cathedral concerning him was that  - -  'c Indulgence ne'er was ask 'd in vain ; He never smote with stinging cane ; He never stopp 'd the penny fees ; 1 His boys were let do as they please . " No let seemed to be placed upon their employment of grammar if this be true . CHAPTER XI . MAURICE GREENE , JAMES KENT , CHARLES STROUD , JOHN TRAVERS , WILLIAM BOYCE . AFTER the deaths of Croft and Weldon , Maurice Greene rose to the front rank of the profession , and became the recognised head of English musicians . lie was the third son of the Rev. Thomas Greene , D.D. , vicar of the united parishes of St. Olave Jewry , and St. Martin 's , Ironmonger Lane , and was born in 1695 . He was admitted as a chorister in St. Paul 's Cathedral in 1706 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he was permitted to wear his surplice was when Queen Anne visited the Cathedral in that year . Charles King // became master in 1707 , and Greene received his first lessons in harmony under him . In 1710 he was articled for five years to Richard Blind , organist of the Cathedral . On the completion of his term he was appointed organist of St. Dunstan 's in the West , chiefly through the interest of his uncle , Sergeant Greene . In 1717 , Greene was appointed organist of St. Andrew 's , TIolborn , over the head of Daniel Purcell . He retained both situations until 1718 , when he resigned them to become organist of St. Paul 's on the death of his master , Richard Blind . The Dean , Dr. Godolphin , conferred upon him the place of a vicar-choral in augmentation of his stipend as organist . IIe was , therefore , the first vicar-choral who did not sing . Greene was appointed organist and composer to the Chapel Royal on the death of Dr. Croft in 1727 , and three years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music at Cambridge on the death of Dr. Tudway . For this purpose he accumulated the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor in Music . His exercise , a setting of Pope 's Ode for St. Cecilia 's Day , was performed on July 6th , 1730 . Pope altered the poem at Greene 's request , and introduced a new stanza commencing , " Amphion thus bade wild dissensions cease . " Five years later Dr. Greene was made " Master of the King 's Musick " in the place of John Eccles , and as part of his duty , wrote several birthday odes , some to the wonderful words of Colley Cibber , the perverter of Shakespeare . Greene published his Forty Select Anthems in 1743 : these , Burney says , " are deficient in that dignity and // solemnity which are essential in all compositions for the Church ; " and a writer in theHar2nonicon fifty years later , when the anthems had had a full and fair trial , states , " they combine the science and vigour of our earlier writers with the melody of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half of the eighteenth century . " There are other anthems published later , and many still remaining in MS . Greene also wrote a number of songs , many of which are remarkable for the grace of their melody ; so that the story told of Handel , that he hung some volumes of Greene 's music out of window because he said " they wanted air , " can scarcely be said to be ben trovato , even if it was vero ! Greene was too anxious to minister to the popular fancy of his time , and therefore much of his work is of little value . There are sufficient indications of genius in his music , to lead to the belief that he would have laboured better had he courted Art rather than fashion . His compositions further comprised a Service in C written at Farnham in 1737 ; Jephtka , an oratorio , 1737 ; a pastoral to words by Dr. John Hoadley called Florimel , dated 1737 ; the Force of Truth , oratorio , 1744 ; the Song of Deborah and Barak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74Q Dr. Greene also set a festival Te Deum in D with Orchestra for the service in com memoration of the suppression of the Scottish rebellion in 1745 ; composed Phosie , a pastoral , 1748 ; music to Spenser 's A noretti , with several cantatas , many organ voluntaries , harpsichord lessons , catches and canons . Handel being very fond of the old Father Smith organ at St. Paul 's , played on it frequently , and Greene
