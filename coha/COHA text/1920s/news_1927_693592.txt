txt Washington 's Birthday and the Debt The Committee for the Washington Celebration in 1032. through President Coolidge. 11 asks for suggestions . For the glory of Washington , and as a tribute to the ideals of all who have given themselves to make the nation worthily great , I suggest that we cancel our war debts and make our celebration world-wide . Largess has always been a feature of royal festivities . A great nation should not be outdone by mere Kings . Suppose Washington had foreseen the power of the nation in less than 200 years to make the most stupendous birthday gift the world has ever known in his honor ! There are many who think that the debts should be canceled simply because it Is honorable and right . Of those who do not see It or think that Is reason enough , some could be made to see it as enlightened selfinterest . Still more would swell with pride at a magnificent gesture that called for no appreciable immediate personal outlay . I wish . most earnestly , It might come to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb. 28 , 1927.
