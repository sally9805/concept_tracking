Latimer , commanding the U. S. forces occupying Nicaragua ( TIME , Sept. 13 et seq. ) a message as follows : <P> " You and your squadron should call yourselves pirates of Wall Street , because against all morality and justice , you trample on the honor of a weak people , solely obeying Kellogg 's orders in behalf of a group of Jewish bankers located in New York , where the Statue of Liberty stands . " <P> Seor Toribio Tijerino , onetime Nicaraguan Consul General at New York , recalled last week to Manhattan newsgatherers the fl , 1,000,000 loan negotiated between the present Nicaraguan Government ( upheld by U. S. marines ) and the Manhattan firms of J. &.; W. Seligman &; Co. , and the Guaranty Trust Co . ( TIME , May 16 ) . Said Seor Tijerino : " The loan contract was entered into with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . . . . <P> " Without risking or spending one cent , without making an investment of any kind , the New York bankers have taken absolute control of Nicaragua . Its transport system , its currency and credit and , by those means , the government of Nicaragua itself , is in the hands of J. &; W. Seligman &; Co. and of the Guaranty Trust Co. of New York . " <P> Seor Tijerino ; then purported to explain the nature of the " loan contract . " He alleged that a 1,000,000 credit was set up in Manhattan on which the Nicaraguan Government pays 6% annual interest , plus a 1% commission interest on the whole amount , whether any of the credit be withdrawn or not . <P> In return , he alleged , the U. S. bankers were given a majority position on the boards of the National Bank of Nicaragua , Inc. , and the Pacific Railways of Nicaragua , Inc. , a position which they allegedly made use of to transfer some 3,500,000 of funds belonging to these institutions from the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; W. Seligman &; Co . Upon these deposits , Seor Tijerino ; alleged that only 2% and 2% interest is being paid . <P> Lastly Seor Tijerino ; ( whose statement to the press was in the form of an open letter to Senator Henrik Shipstead* ) declared : <P> " It will interest you to know that in the reorganized Nicaraguan boards of directors , Mr. R. F. Loree , who is one of the vice presidents of the Guaranty Trust Co. , and Mr. Philip Tillinghast , president and treasurer respectively of the National Bank of Nicaragua , have been granted salaries of $6,000 each . These salaries , Mr. Senator , are only in the nature of a windfall for these gentlemen . <P> " A very careful study of the loan contract , reveals that it does not in the least deal with a straight loan at all . In other words , the bankers are not lending Nicaragua one red penny of their money . " <P> At Manhattan , Mr. Loree and Mr. Tillinghast would make to reporters no statement concerning Nicaragua . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last January of a sub-committee investigating the Nicaraguan situation .
