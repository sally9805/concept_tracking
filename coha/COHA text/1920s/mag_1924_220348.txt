Brave , boyish Janet Rawley and her brutishly neurasthenic spouse , Jack , are about to plunge into African shrubbery on a safari for game and gold . Capt . James Antrim , of the King 's African Rifles , splendid fellow that he is , can not bear to see such ill-mated tenderfeet wandering loose among the lions , thirst and loneliness . He turns in his steamer ticket from Mombasa to England , takes command for and of the Rawleys , gets the safari past the usual vile German agent and as far as a highland camp , three weeks from nowhere . Here fever , whiskey , manslaughter , flies and love descend upon them . Rawley indulges in the first three and then loses his unpleasant self in the ample countryside . Janet and Antrim stagger home , black-lipped and full of British guilt . After the decent British interval , they marry . A ghostly negroid smell haunts them nightly , requiring Antrim 's return to Africa to lay the ghost of Dingaan , a black he sent to find the strayed Rawley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clearing Dingaan of a murder he might pardonably have committeed . <P> Mr. Young 's African smells , sights and sounds are indubitable . He can occasionally strike off action , too . His motivation , however , is vague , unaccountable , spasmodic . His emotions plod in circles . His temper the generous will call wholesome and dignified , others cold and muttonish . <P> <P> * WOODSMOKE Francis Brett Young-Dutton ( $2.00 ) .
