Everyday an eager audience of 3,000 Soviet Comrades assembles in Moscow , to witness the slow unfolding of a most ominous drama-the so-called Shahkta or Technicians Trial . <P> Forty-nine Russians and three Germans face the Soviet Supreme Court , the Russians charged with High Treason and all defendants with conspiracy to sabotage* the vital Soviet coal mines in the region of the River Don . <P> So eager are the trial-goers that many stand in line all night to obtain small pink tickets good for one day only . Every syllable of the grim proceedings flashes over all the Russias by radio broadcast . Cinema cameras whir at intervals . Flashlight powders occasionally blaze and boom . Fifty Russian and Asiatic correspondents keep 28 telegraph lines busy . Delegations of spectators pour in , daily , from provincial Soviets , plump down on especially reserved benches and marvel at their surroundings . <P> They , peasants and factory workers , have entered the vast , rectangular Imperial Hall of Columns-white columns of pearly marble , twinkling in the radiance of a myriad crystal chandeliers . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stately music amid the white fire of diamonds . But now the bench of the Soviet Supreme Court dominates , draped with a coarse cloth , blood red . <P> Though the phenomenon of the Shahkta Trial is now in its second month , proceedings are still in the most preliminary stage . No evidence has been heard concerning the Prosecution 's astounding charge that the sabotage ring was partially financed by one of the greatest public utility corporations in the world , the A. E. G. ( Allgemeine **26;6701;TOOLONG ) or General Electric Company of Germany . <P> The German Ambassador to Soviet Russia , Count Brockdorff-Rantzau , has been present or represented from the first , striving constantly to assure a fair trial for employes of the A. E. G. who stand accused . <P> Secondly there has been no real examination of the supposed Master Mind of the sabotage conspiracy , a Jew , one Rabinovich . <P> <P> The late Nikolai Lenin held M. Rabinovich in such esteem that the Jew , although a " bourgeois , " was seated as technical expert on highest Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , virtually the industrial dictator of the region of the Don . <P> Lastly bold hints by the Prosecution that the French and Polish governments have given aid and comfort to the conspirators have been sternly hushed by the presiding Chief Justice , Professor A. Y. Vyshinsky , Principal of the First State University at Moscow . <P> Nervous and low-voiced , the Dean is under the stigma of having been a Menshevik , not a Bolshevik . That is to say , he once belonged to the " Smaller Group " or " Mensheviki " of the Russian Social Democratic Party . The " Larger Group " or " Bolsheviki " have long since obliterated their rivals , now constitute the Communist Party , and are the political masters of Russia . As a mere Menshevik , the Chief Justice is notably deferential to the potent Soviet Prosecutor . He , the dread Nikolai Vassilievich Krylenko , onetime Commander of the Red Army , plays both hero and villain in the Shahkta Trial . <P>                @ @ @ @ @
