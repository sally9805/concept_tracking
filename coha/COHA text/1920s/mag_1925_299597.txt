YUGOSLAVIA <P> In the Kingdom of the Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Yugo-Slavia ) , there is a violent election in progress . <P> Elections in the Balkans , particularly in Yugo-Slavia , work on an entirely different principle than do those in other lands . In the first place , much depends upon whether the Government in power wants to remain in power . Usually it does and , to achieve its desired end , it uses many means . Sometimes it is bribery , often ballot changing , occasionally death , imprisonment or illegal disenfranchisement-all of which efforts are destined to increase the Government 's plurality . <P> Last week , Stefan Raditch , leader of the Croatian autonomists ( i.e. , those advocating total separation from the Serb Kingdom and self-rule as an independent republic ) was found under a bed in a house in Zagreb , the address of which had been supplied by a Radical turned traitor . Police dragged Raditch , who is under a ban for being in league with the Bolsheviki , from under the bed by the heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all . Raditch 's party ( Croatian Peasant 's Party ) , which formed the mainstay of the Opposition with 70 seats in the Skupshtina ( National Assembly ) , was disbanded by order of white-whiskered Nikolai Pashitch , ironhanded Premier of Yugo-Slavia . All leaders and some 600 supporters were arrested . Angry faces emitted angry noises , but the inexorable soldiers stood by to see that the bubbling revolutionary spirit did not boil over . <P> In Belgrade , Yugo-Slavian capital , Nikolai Pashitch pays no attention to the protests and growls of his angry opponents . Sitting back in his easy chair , the octogenarian Premier runs his desiccated fingers through his long beard and confidently hopes for an overwhelming " electoral " victory .
