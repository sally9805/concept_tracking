At the opening of the lecture amphitheatre of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the Medical Centre , Manhattan , a little old Dutchman , Professor C. W. Ariens Kappers , got up to talk . He began immediately to use the names of mysterious and exotic sicknesses-African Sleeping Sickness and how it had been cured by Bayer , malaria injections and how they helped general paralysis ( TIME , April 2 . June 4 ) . For several minutes Professor Kappers stressed the past success of quiet cures wrought in maniacs and melancholies by somnifen injections over a period of 14 days . Somnifen produces a hypnotic sleep in which there is loss of consciousness , but no relaxation of reflexes . The patient can therefore be roused to take nourishment , attend to physical needs , etc. , dropping off to sleep again as soon as he is left alone . It has been used to bring on " twilight sleep " in obstetrics . <P> Of prehistoric brain surgery Anatomist Kappers reminisced , " It is even probable that the trephine holes found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A short time ago the aborigines of some Pacific islands still exercised a similar practice , making holes in their skulls with sharp shells to cure chronic headaches . " He mentioned briefly his own theory of neurobiotaxis which considers the brain as a functioning organ and attempts to explain its complexities in terms of work . This done , Anatomist Kappers eulogized U. S. neurologists and neurosurgeons for their advance in the treatment of tumours and abscesses of the nervous system . Then he spoke briefly but gravely of the use of nicotine : " The abuse of nicotine has a severe effect upon the nervous system of the intestines and blood vessels , paralysing the postganglionic neurones , leading to hallucinations and weakening of energy . . . . " <P> <P> In this statement , Anatomist Kappers cast doubt on current notions about nicotine . Many U. S. doctors have contended and often hoped to prove that smoking does no harm . In Newark , N. J. , five children of the Fillimon family have been smoking full-sized cigars since the age of two . The oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . All of these children appear healthy , go to school regularly , get good grades .
