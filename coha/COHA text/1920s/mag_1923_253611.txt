The Peking Government ordered the forts of Woo-Sung to open fire on the naval squadron that rebelled last week . The order was , however , ignored . The Government also stated that the naval rebels established a mail and telegraph censorship . <P> Admiral Tu , head of the Chinese Navy , tendered his resignation , but the Government declined to accept it . He was instructed to attempt pacification of the mutineers by making up their arrears of pay and establishing a future maintenance fund . <P> The Peking press does not agree with the Government that the dissatisfaction among the officers and men is because of overdue pay ; it attributes the real cause of the trouble to political intrigue against the Government , which recently lost a vote of confidence in Parliament .
