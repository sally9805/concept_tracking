Gary , Charles M. Schwab , James A. Farrell , E. G. Grace and others . The letter accepted in principle the abolition of the twelve-hour day , and promised that the change from the two-shift to the three-shift system would be brought about as soon as there was a sufficient surplus of labor . <P> Judge Gary later amplified this statement by declaring that 60,000 additional men would be necessary to effect the change .

Some even went so far as to assert that there was a plentiful supply of labor on hand and that steel companies were turning men away daily . Mr. Gary himself declared that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-hour day would be abolished , but that efforts would begin at once .
