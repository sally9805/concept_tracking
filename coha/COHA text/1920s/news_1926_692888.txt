I Denies " Coddling " at Sing Sing . , o0 Warden Lewis E. Lewes of Sing Sing Prison said that reports of " coddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , were the greatest cause of crime , and he added that if drug addiction caused the crime wave , the police were not getting the addicts as he had only 6 addicts to each 100 prisoners . District Attorney Jog ) H. Banton of New York County and District Attorney Elvin M. Edwards of Nassau County offered cooperation . Some of the witnesses , none of whom was sworn , did not favor more severe punishment . State Senator Caleb , H. Baumes , Chairman of the Crime Commission , said : " It is most important that we do something now to stop crimes of violence entailing loss of life and danger to propert3 . A lawless condition prevails , as witness the daring hold-up at the Roosevelt Hospital , and I think this commission would be justified in recommending very severe measures for criminals convicted of crimes of that nature . " " What we want , " said Assemblyman Burton D. Esmond of the commission , " is to get on the statute books a set of laws that will mean that hold-up men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of , and with no parole . " - Commissioner the fourth speaker . He began by saying that nothing the preceding speakers had said was of any aid to him in conducting the Police Department . Wants Firearms Controlled . " All hold-up.a. - are attributable to the criminals who are armed with revolvers , " he said . " I have met only one criminal who was a real man with courage enough to tackle another man without having a revolver . With all due respect ' to the National Crime Commission , why did n't it tackle that question before it did ? As for arming everybody  --  what use is a pistol to a citizen in a hold-up ? Six policemen have been shot this year . Look at the disadvantage they are under with their pistols . The question of the control of firearms must be met , no matter whom you may run up against , and 1 understand there is a powerful lobby , in Washington to protect firearms . " The Police Department is not perfect . You could tell .. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tot to do . We need 4,300 men to cover posts in this city . Today crime is organized and the criminal is intelligent in crime . " Second to firearms in importance are the ' fences , ' receivers of stolen goods . %%day you can steal anything and dispose of it . Severe sentences for criminals are very important . Your commission should not spend too much time-on statistics , Go into the practical side of crime Speqd a week with us at Headquarters . See the line-up every day and you will get more information that will be of practical benefit in one day there than you will in six months of .. studying statistics . Slayers of Police Dodge Trial .. " When six men can enter a big hospital in daylight and get away with $10,000 there is no question that apprehension is not quick enough . On the other hand , the policeman is at a disadvantage . Not a single man who killed a policeman flits year has yet been tried . This is demoralizing to the Police Department . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not receive proper respect . Even some District Attorneys seem to think they should ' not believe a police officer . Yet there are some Judges on the bench today who could not qualify as patrolmen because of their past records . " 74tr. briefly mentioned " social and political influences " and then said that some probation and parole officers received too much consideration from Judges and that the criminal should be made to " stand on his own , " should be ably prosecuted and receive a heavy sentence upon conviction . " There is a sad lack of cooperation and coordination between our men and officials in prisons  --  the Tombs and Sing Sing , for instance . They seem to be opposed to us . The criminal wins their affection and the policeman is not wanted there . " " Study the Magistrates ' Courts , " resumed Mr. . " Why have we forty-eight of them scattered all over the city ? They should be consolidated . " How could we cooperate better ? Subordinate our personal desire for publicity , have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can obtain help from no direction . We Must also have cooperation from the Bar Association . Why should any lawyer be interested in a gang of known criminals ? Lewes Defends His System . Warden Lewes favored indeterminate sentences and a " full time parole board appoined by the Supreme Court or some such body . " He said that Judges " all over the State " could not tell how long an individual should be in prison when they considered the crime and not the individual himself . " Nobody at Sing Sing favors coddling the criminal , " said the Warden , " but we do favor intelligent action . Your gunman is hired by gamblers and also by strike breakers and big manufacturers . The gunman would not exist ' , unless there was something in it for him . " The inequality of sentences imposed is one great cause of discontent and1 revengeful attitudes among prisoners . We are now releasing men who , we know , will return to crime . But you hear only of the failures , of the one released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four who go straight . " The last show we had in Sing Sing was in February , 1925 . We have moving pictures for first grade men , men against whom there is no complaint , and we have baseball on Saturdays and Sundays . If you keep a man locked up in a cell you destroy all that goes to make up a human being . You ca n't put him away in a human filing cabinet . We are not running an orphan asylum . Our discipline is severer than it was fifteen years ago . " The way to determine what prisoners should never get out of prison is not at their trials , but later . The remedy for crime is the certainty of detection and punishment . Revolvers are the chief cause . " Baseball , he said , kept the prisoner 's mind " in the open " and away from crime . He argued that the prisoner should always have a chance for a little initiative . " Is it not true that criminals have a better time in Sing Sing than out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Warden . " Only the pleasant , frothy things at Sing Sing are presented to the public . The really shrewd criminals are not in prison . They are outside , and I mean just what I say , Mr. Esmond . " Warden Lawes said it was not possible to keep the sixteen-year-old prisoners segregated at all times because ' of housing conditions . William Lewis Butcher of the Crime Commission then asked if the youthful criminals did not have two or three contacts daily with hardened criminals . " Yes , " answered the Warden , " and it may do them good . Such contacts are not always what you think . Contacts with other youthful criminals are often worse . The older man has learned something . " State Senator William L. Love , who inspected the . prisons in the State and reported his findings to the Legislature , said the prisons , except Comstock , were " antediluvian . " He declared that modern cell blocks , sunshine and proper recreation were needed . " I believe in moving pictures and baseball for prisoners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want coddling . They want equality of sentences . Some get a year for stealing an automobile in one locality and from three to five years for the same crime in another locality . We need a conference of judicial officers to determine upon equable sentences . I favor a trained psychologist examining all these men . Much crime is predicated upon ill health . " Others Offer Suggestions . Lawson Purdy of the Charity Organization Society said the parole system should be as well organized as the probation system . He was followed by Miss Frances Taussig of the Jewish Social Service Association , who offered that organization 's cooperation , Edward R. Cass , Secretary of the Prison Association of New York , declared that not only our alien population but the " whole country " had gone " liberty mad . " Mr. Cass questioned the advisability of courts speeding up , rather than taking longer for a , " steady utilization of the maximum of the court machinery . He suggested a study of unequal sentences for similar crimes and urged a reorganization of the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parole work . District Attorney Elvin M. Edwards of Nassau County , L. I. , suggested that District Attorneys have control of the criminal calendars and that there be a " central supervision over District Attorneys ' offices throughout the State to see whether indictments were promptly tried . " " In Nassau County , " said Mr. Edwards , " we have issued 4,000 pistol permits , yet I know of no opportunity any citizen has had to use one in his own defense . I do know of a case wherein the murder and suicide of two fine and useful people would have been avoided had there been no revolver . " District Attorney Banton offered the cooperation of his office in any way the commission could use it . He said the recent bail laws had operated successfully and the efficiency of the criminal law had been increased there , by . lie called both the Penal law and the Code of Criminal Procedure " archaic . " Dr. Walter N. Thayer , Superintendent of the Institution for Defective Delinquents at Napanoch , said . there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted " burglary . Charles R. Chute , Secretary of the National Probation Association ; Henry S. Williams of Brooklyn , a reformed ex-convict known as the " Mark Twain Burglar " because he once attempted to rob Mark Twain 's home ; Dr. Khan of Brooklyn Hospital , Captain George P. Dutton . Deputy Superintendent of the State Police , and Howard C. Bather , Secertary and Superintendent of the Society for the Prevention of Crime , also spoke . The commission , will meet again in some other . city , upon a. date not yet announced ,
