Seventeen years ago a slender , piquant figure dressed in 18th-Century furbelows stepped on the stage of Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House and began in an appealing but none-too-confident voice the music which Giacomo Puccini had written for his Manon Lescaut. * The debutante was Lucrezia Bori , a young Spaniard who by rights was Lucrezia Borgia , namesake and descendant of the Renaissance sorceress . The hero who lifted his voice high in praise for her was Enrico Caruso . On the stage they loved and she forsook him for the riches of another . They were reconciled and together banished on a convict ship for the Louisiana territory . <P> The story is old , maudlin , but it served again last week for the season 's opening performance at the Metropolitan . Again Lucrezia Bori was the misguided heroine . Round little Beniamino Gigli sang the Donna non vidi mai in a voice that compares to Caruso 's as Chianti to Napoleon brandy . <P> Seventeen years have dealt kindly with " the little Bori . " They have added few pounds to her figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid popularity . Hence , because she sang , the Metropolitan 's 47th First Night was for many a success . Others liked it because the music demanded little concentration . Intermissions were long enough in which to scrutinize the " Diamond Horseshoe , " to mark the majestic presence of the end Mrs. Vanderbilt , the absence of Mrs. Vincent Astor 's equine beauty . Dr. and Mrs. Herbert L. Satterlee entertained Explorer and Mrs. William Beebe . Otto Hermann Kahn spent the third act in the foyer , loudly discussing stocks in dizzying million figures ( see p. 45 ) . <P> <P> Studying their programs , a few patrons noted a new name on the board of directors . The name was Ivy Lee , potent in its own right as that of a famed publicist but newsworthy in a Metropolitan program because among Mr. Lee 's clients is John Davison Rockefeller Jr . This change in the directorate seemed to bode action on the new opera house which Philanthropist Rockefeller wants for the centre of his proposed midtown Manhattan development ( TIME , Feb. 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan 's seldom disputed dictator-patron , Otto Hermann Kahn . <P> Music critics were bored both by Manon Lescaut and the perennial talk of a new house . They considered the season 's prospects . Because the four new operas presented last year were failures , this year 's additions to the repertoire are older , better-tested.
