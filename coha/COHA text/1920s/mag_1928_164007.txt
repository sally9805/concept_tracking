Many were the papers and widespread the interests of the physicians and scientists there assembled . <P> Cancer . Dr. Maud Slye of Chicago University said that the Mendelian law of heredity applied to cancer susceptibility and cancer resistance developed through 67,000 individual studies on mice . Persistently Pathologist Slye bred the reliable rodents . Twenty years she worked and has finally concluded that cancer is not contagious , but tendencies for or against it can be inherited in mice . Twenty-five generations has she bred absolutely free of cancer because the original stock had been eugenically chosen . Cancerous ancestors infallibly transmitted the disease down the generations infallibly . Said Dr. Slye : " If we could manage human breeding as expertly as we can manage mouse breeding , it might be possible to develop a race , or at least a segment of a race , that we knew was absolutely immune to cancer . " <P> Yellow Fever . From Havana came Dr. Aristides Agramonte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. just after the Spanish American War . Graphically he described the adventures of the scientific pioneers who discovered the mosquito carrier* of yellow fever in 1900 . Enthusiastically he lauded the labors of Dr. Walter Reed , Dr. James Carroll , Dr. Jesse W. Lazear . <P> Show . Adjoining the meeting hall was a medical exhibit . Medical literature , pharmaceutical products , surgical supplies , health foods vied for attention . Outstanding among the popular shows was the new cure for hay fever . Like a kitchen stove it looked , with a pipe leading out through a fake window . Fresh air enters the pipe , is drawn into the body of the contrivance where it is purified of all pollen , and is then released into the room for respiratory purposes . Not much protection on a country ramble , but a great relief to the cityfolk . <P> <P> * Stegomyia fasciata.
