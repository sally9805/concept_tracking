To knowledge of the five vitaminic ingredients of foods , which make life liveable . Dr. Herbert McLean Evans of the University of California last week joined news of a sixth . <P> The five previously known are : Vitamin A , which stimulates body growth ; Vitamin B , which prevents neuritis ( beriberi is the characteristic disease when Vitamin B is lacking ) ; Vitamin C , which prevents scurvy ( see below ) ; Vitamin D , which prevents rickets ; and Vitamin E , which must be present if an animal is to be fertile . <P> To young rats Dr. Evans , head of the University of California 's department of anatomy , fed all five vitamins with nourishing , highly purified casein and recrystallized cane sugar . The rats remained half grown and sexually immature . Previous experiments had shown that rats given food that contained the five vitamins thrived normally . Clearly , Dr. Evans ' diet lacked some element present but not recognized in the foods of foregoing vitamin experiments . <P> Fresh lettuce was added to the rats ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Evans fed others liver with the basic regimen . Liver , too , effectively matured them . Dr. Evans and his aides decided that both liver and lettuce contained some element the lack of which prevented physical maturity . They reduced that common element of lettuce and liver to a form that was relatively pure as a physical preparation but intricately complex as a chemical compound . They named it Vitamin F and guarded well their research . Immediately upon the public announcement last week , Dr. Evans took train for Manhattan , and a long awaited trip to Europe . <P> Back &; forth across the paved courtyard of Manhattan 's Bellevue Hospital , Arctic Explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson , rugged as a caribou , strode last week with ten meat-eating companions . On nothing but fresh killed meat did they subsist during the week , and nothing other than fresh meat were they to eat for fourteen days . If at the end of a fortnight , none had scurvy , if in no case were legs and thighs splotched with extravasated blood , if no gums swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms ) , then Explorer Stefansson would have proved-better than biologists could have proved in experiments with rats-that meat , at least freshly killed meat , contains Vitamin C and prevents scurvy , scourge of seafarers and Arctic explorers .
