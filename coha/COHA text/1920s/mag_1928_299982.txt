Two snorting , supercharged horses clopped over the steeplechase course at Lancaster County ( Pa. ) fair last week . One horse eased past the other , the race was between the two . As he eased past his rival Jockey Moler brought his riding-crop down upon the shoulders of Rival-Jockey Fisher . Though no jockey may be penalized if in the frenzy of the home stretch he thwacks his mount , he shall be punished if caught in the act of thwacking a competing jockey . Moler passed the finish line ahead of his rival but was disqualified for striking him : the race went to Fisher .
