Cities with subways , or with plans for subways , watched New York City last week . New York has the largest subway system in the U. S. and the question was : have rides-for-a-nickel joined the jitney bus and the horse-cab ? <P> The Interborough Rapid Transit Co. ( one of New York 's two subway systems ) contracted with the City of New York in 1913 to give rides-for-a-nickel until 1968 , when the line reverts to the city . After 15 years of experience , the I. R. T. has concluded that rides-for-a-nickel are economically obsolete . Last winter the I. R. T. asked the State authorities to authorize a 7-cent fare . Refused , the I. R. T. sought a Federal court order restraining New York City and State from preventing the collection of 7-cent fares , on the ground that the 5-cent fare was confiscatory . Last week , the I. R. T. obtained a 38-page Federal decision allowing the 7-cent fare temporarily . Mayor James J. Walker and his famed predecessor , John F. Hylan , both announced promptly that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate advanced any plan for furnishing better subway service at five cents . <P> The U. S. Supreme Court was to review the case . Meantime , the I. R. T. cars clanged on , overcrowded , smelly , losing money . <P> Disinterested students of New York 's subway jam noticed things which seemed lost sight of in the legal-political confusion . I. R. T. officials admitted that a 7-cent fare would not eliminate the almost homicidal crushes on the I. R. T. at rush hours . Why , wondered economists , would it not be to the city 's and the I. R. T. 's mutual advantage to allow more than one fare , keeping a 5-cent minimum ? The London Underground and the Paris Metro and Nord-Sud sell tickets of various classes . Why not have 10-cent or even 25-cent turnstiles for thousands of riders who would pay to escape the cattle-like stampede ? The extra revenue would provide extra cars to accommodate the 5-centers . Why not subway Pullmans ?                  @ @ @
