CASPAR HAUSER-Jacob Wassermann-Liveright ( $3 ) . <P> In his preface to English-speaking readers Author Wassermann explains that he is recounting a notorious incident of German history to illustrate a universal abuse ; for in the youthful victim of a political intrigue he sees the symbol of all misunderstood children . By such explicit labeling the author hopes to establish his book as something more than the excellent historical novel which a large and enthusiastic European public thought it . <P> In 1828 , Caspar Hauser , 17 , stumbling alone into Nrnberg , stimulated general curiosity because he could neither walk nor talk better than a child of two . He could remember that he had always lived in darkness ( presumably a cell ) , slept on straw , eaten only bread and water , played pathetically with a toy horse . This data formed the basis of a famous criminologist 's charge that Caspar , a legitimate prince , had been criminally secreted and finally cast out by the House of Baden , lest he foil a court intrigue by claiming his rightful heritage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likelihood of fraud . But the successive murders of astute criminologist and innocent boy himself left little room for doubt . Meanwhile Caspar , bandied conspicuously from one guardian to another-a double-faced English lord in the pay of the court , a neurotic , lustful woman , a self-righteous bully of a pedagogue-suffered tortures of childish bafflement at the heartless stupidity of his elders . Treacherous death was actually release .
