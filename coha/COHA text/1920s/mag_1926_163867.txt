Signer Maffi , leader of the minute Communist Opposition in the Italian Chamber , flayed the Locarno Pacts when they were presented for ratification last week : " To the false democracy of bourgeois governments which met at Locarno , we Communists oppose the desire for peace of Soviet Russia , which is the only country in the world willing and ready to discuss the question of disarmament . . . . I laugh with those who laugh at Locarno ! " While Signor Maffii " laughed , " the Chamber ratified the Pacts by a solid Fascist vote , with the Aventine Opposition absent ( TIME , Jan. 25 ) and only two Communists daring to vote contra-Locarno . <P> At Manhattan famed financiers Thomas W. Lament and Otto H. Kahn spoke before the Foreign Policy Association in praise of the Fascist rgime . <P> Mr. Lamont began by recalling that since the advent of Fascismo unemployment has been wiped out in Italy , the floating debt reduced and the budget balanced . He concluded : <P> " All we know is that other European Governments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the life of the common people has been enormously improved . That the people of Italy are behind their Government can , I think , be best shown by the manner in which they approved the terms for the settlement of Italy 's debt with the United States . " <P> Mr. Kahn : <P> " To anyone who knew Italy in the years immediately following the War , the change which came over the country with the advent of Mussolini is little short of miraculous . He did not promise or give advantage to any one class . He called upon and demanded of all classes that they work together for the good of the nation . He is neither a demagog nor a reactionary . He is a patriotic realist . " <P> Dr. William Y. Elliott , lecturer on Government at Harvard , flayed Fascismo before the same gathering : " The liberty so zealously maintained by this Government in its Bill of Rights has been wiped out by Italy , and Fascism has spread over Europe as far as China . . . . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain in control until the public arises . It is put forth , as all dictatorships are put forth , as a case of the means justifying the end . . . . <P> " Fascism is maintained by violence and ultimately will be met by counter violence , but not while Mussolini retains his power . Liberty is the preservation of minority criticism . This has been eliminated . " Many Italians in the Southern Tyrol have Austrian names . Last week King Vittorio Emanuele signed a Cabinet decree ordering all families in the Tyrolese province of Trento to adopt a strictly Italian spelling of their names , even though the offending syllables might have to be completely translated . Il Benito had taken care to see that fines up to 25,000 lire ( $1,000 ) were provided for nonobservance of the decree .
