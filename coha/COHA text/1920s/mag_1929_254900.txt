Eight out of eleven Oregonians took off their jerseys , played with their bare arms sticking out of their pads . They got one touchdown on a Florida pass but Quarterback Crabtree of Florida , used to warm weather , trickled 81 yards through them , and Ed Sauls and Red McEwen made two more . Florida 20 , Oregon 6 . <P> Georgia 's little Bulldogs quit the gambling football they played against N. Y. U. and Alabama and went after Georgia Tech , cautiously , as though convinced that this was an important game . In the first period Waugh was hell , but after that the Yellow Jackets blocked one of Chandler 's punts , hurried him on another , made him fumble a third , tied the score . Georgia picked up a blocked kick and an edge . Georgia 12 . Georgia Tech 6 . <P> South Carolina could not take the ball anywhere even when they got it . Most of the time Tennessee 's McEver had it , his chunky mud-legs , pumping . The five touchdowns and three extra points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the season 's high man , Hinkle of Bucknell . Tennessee 54 , South Carolina 0 . <P> Western Maryland kicked as often as they could . So did the University of Maryland . It made the game dull , but Frank Clary got across the goal-line twice for Western Maryland 's eleventh straight victory , 12-0.
