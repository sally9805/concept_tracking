A glum and docile crowd coagulated before one of the National City Bank 's branches in Manhattan an early morning last week . Behind the bank 's bolted doors and copper-framed windows employes pulled themselves tense with the expectation of rushing business , and glowed with pride at the immediate success of their President Charles Edwin Mitchell 's new banking idea . President Mitchell had announced that this bank ( biggest in the U. S. ) would loan $50 to $1,000 at 6% interest to responsible employed persons , with no other security than their own signatures and the endorsement of two respectable friends . ( All such loans to be repaid within a year . ) Under such conditions the crowd outside the National City 's office yearned to borrow . They were accommodated . <P> People have always needed money for personal emergencies . If they had no property real or personal to hypothecate , they could borrow on their personal credit only from usurers , who charged 20% and more interest . <P> In 1910 Arthur J. Morris , lawyer of Norfolk , Va. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It loaned money at 7% interest to honest employed persons . Borrowers repaid loans by monthly installments . Now there exist " Morris Plan " banks in 109 cities . They have injured the usury business . <P> The success of " Morris Plan " banks made enterprising bankers study the field . In New York City the National City group made surveys ; in Buffalo the Marine Trust group ( Chairman Elliott C. McDougal , President George Franklin Rand , * Vice-President , Seymour H. Knox ) . Last week the Marine Trust announced that it would loan money at 6% , without security , to salaried persons . Mr. Mitchell 's National City had anticipated Buffalo by a day . <P> Other banks , of course , will follow . But none yet accommodates the needy borrower in every respect . If he has no willing friends to countersign his note to a " Morris Plan " ( 7% ) or " National City-Marine Trust Plan " ( 6% ) bank , he must pawn his household goods , automobile or other personal possessions with whatever moneylender he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is it easy to get endorsers , since persons with sufficient money sense to become acceptable guarantors are not promiscuous with their signatures . <P> <P> * Cousin of President James Henry Rand Jr . of Remington-Rand , office equipment .
