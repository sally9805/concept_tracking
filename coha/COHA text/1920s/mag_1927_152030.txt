The British Treasury announced last week without comment the significant fact that onetime ( 1921-26 ) Governor-General Baron Byng of Canada has refused to pay a so-called " peerage patent fee " demanded by the Treasury . Theoretically this sum , amounting to several hundred pounds , is due as payment for inserting in the Official Gazette a paragraph to the effect that , last fall , Baron Byng was elevated to the style of Viscount . Actually , of course , the " fee " is a time-honored bit of British graft . How did Lord Byng explain his nonpayment ? <P> " My decision is taken , " said Viscount Byng , " in view of the recent charges made by Lord Rosebery that many peerages are bought with money which finds its way into party funds . ... I am of the opinion that a titular reward ought not to be conditional upon the payment of any at all substantial sum . . . . " <P> As many know , the British Treasury usually remits the " patent fee " to men so distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the Earls of Oxford and Asquith , Balfour , and Birkenhead all received " remissions " of between 2,255 ( $10,813 ) and 330 ( $1,603 ) , at the time of their creations . In the case of Viscount Byng , it would seem , someone in His Majesty 's Treasury has blundered .
