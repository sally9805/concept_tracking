txt An Artist Protests . In my copy of Monday 's TIMES , under the caption " Art Independents Hail Decade 's Work " I read with complete amazement the utterly erroneous statement that I first won recognition in the American art world via the Independent Society of Artists , of which I was one of the directors for a number of years and from which , with the late HamIlion Easter Field , I resigned in disgust on account of the methods of publicity employed by the clique who have controlled that society 's welfare since its foundation . May I be permitted to call your attention and the public 's to the facts that work of mine was exhibited and commented upon both by critics and public in the now historically important International Exhibition of 1912 , known as the Armory Show , and even previous to that I exhibited work which won notice at the Academy here in New York several times , and likewise at the Boston Art Club . Possibly Gertrude Whitney , Robert Henri . John Sloan and Walter Pach are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the society in question . I trust that for the sake of correcting a misstatement given to the public through Your paper and for the sake of fair play to all truly independent artists you will publish this letter .
