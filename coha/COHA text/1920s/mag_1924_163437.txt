Room-wrecking is a tradition at Trinity College , University of Toronto . Sophomores do the wrecking in the rooms of the Freshmen . But a new Provost has arisen who regards room-wrecking and other developments of the hazing mores as exhibitions of " that innate vulgarity so common in America . " <P> In this spirit of culture , the Provost ( Dr. Seager ) imposed a fine of $400 upon the group of Sophomores who most recently perpetuated the room-wrecking tradition . Expulsion is the penalty for nonpayment of the provostic fine . <P> The picturesque campus incident has brought to light a widespread complaint on the part of British " university men " against the Americanization of Canada 's colleges . They point , for example , to the Greek letter fraternities , which in the last 20 years have enjoyed a mushroom growth at Toronto , McGill , etc . Oxford and Cambridge afford no precedents for such silly , bourgeois performances , say the university men . In fact , the whole of Canadian university life , they say , is unpleasantly infected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of affairs say that Canada draws the best from both British and U. S. tradition and creates institutions which are superbly Canadian . <P> In any case , the $400 fine must be paid .
