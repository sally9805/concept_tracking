" Being a good dentist evidently is no longer the thing . The man who commercializes dentistry is the successful businessman . " <P> A young dentist , Dr. Arthur Woolsey , of Elizabeth , N. J. , in despair , wrote that on his own stationery last week . And he wrote this : " I have everything mortgaged to the limit and not a thing of my own except that which is due me at the office . If that had come in when it was due this could have been avoided . My only message to the dentists with whom I have worked is to work for cash only ; credit will only bring trouble . " <P> Drooping over the paper he wrote too : " I am most heartbroken over the necessity , but with no more resources it is better this way . . . . My family is upstairs , quiet . . . . " <P> They , his wife and two children , were quiet , because just before writing his hopeless testament he had murdered them .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
