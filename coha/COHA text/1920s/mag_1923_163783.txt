The agitation over faked sculpture has stimulated a movement to forbid the departure of any art work from France unless the sale is approved by the Ministry of Fine Arts and a group of connoisseurs . Roman gate ways , ancient mantelpieces , church sculpture from provincial towns have been avidly bought up by Americans , but will probably not be allowed to leave the country . Some French critics , however , say that France has only herself to blame for her low estimate of precious Corots , Daumiers , Cezannes , and for her poor care of her art treasures . In America , they admit , these objects are at least protected against vandalism in museums .
