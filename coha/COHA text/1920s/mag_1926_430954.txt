 | YOU know how it has been said , " Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown . " Well , hers does n't . And perhaps it is because she has rested her head so much by keeping her crown in a glass case . Even as a Crown Princess , she soon laid aside , like that , her coronet . She wound round her head instead the soft , white mamma . And she put on the tunic blouse and the short , kilted fota . And attired like this , in their own national dress , Marie of Rumania went out and sought and found her people . They are a picturesque people . You have seen the Romany gipsy , who sometimes wanders into our western world with her bangled necklaces and her spangled costume that flames with yellow and red and orange , as if she 'd snatched it from an eastern sunset . As colorful as that are the Romany peasants on a saint 's fete da 5 , when they come streaming from their picture-book . douses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas tree . Then , out from the church . steps the priest , holding up the brilliant banners of a decorative faith which illumines every public occasion . These are people for whom religion is still alight with wax tapers kept burning before pictured saints , who stand in unbroken succession since St. Paul , the founder of this eastern earliest Christianity . And they are a primitive people . They are only forty-eight hours from Paris by the fast express that comes across the continent of Europe to make here its last stop . But they are more than a hundred years from New York , when you see them doing their agriculture by hand . And they are a thousand years ago , when you watch their wedding dance that commemorates the story of the Romans and the Sabine women . The bronze statue of Romulus and Remus , standing in the Plaza Lispecani at Bucharest , links them to that early empire , many of whose most ancient customs and traditions still survive in their daily life . That is Rumania looking backward . There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can lay off a crown to lean down close to the hearts of her people . So , listening softly , she has learned to know them and their needs . And so their humanity has come to hold for her a wider interest than all the royalty around her . After all , she tells me , one can get just as tired of a crown or a coronet , even all set with diamonds , as one does of last year 's hat . And the sameness of court circles grows much the same as the sameness of anywhere else . For over and over there are only the same pleasant things to be said : How beautiful are the grapes this year ! How beautiful are the flowers on  | the terrace ! How beautiful is the weather ! Or at any rate , how beautiful it is sure to be tomorrow ! Moshka , coming down the grand staircase at Castle Pelasor , turned to me : " Oh , for heaven 's sake , if I could only think of something new to say ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with history whitehot ? some of it blood-red -- in the making . But of all that no echo was entering here , where conversation was curtailed by the consideration that every remark should contribute only to a pleasant pan of praise . Always , in every royal court , it has been correct to create an atmosphere of sugar and spice and everything nice to place before a Queen . It is a tribute that , as a survival of ancient custom and ceremony , Her Majesty here in Rumania still graciously accepts . But only as a pretty , painted picture . Now , what is the real business of living ? And right down the steps of her throne , this Queen has gone trippingly to find out . Let no bowing courtier attempt to tell Marie of Rumania the moon is made of green cheese . She is sure to start off for a look herself . " There is nothing my mother may not wish to do , " Nicky says . " And the more unusual it is , the more she will wish to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient convent , isolated on a mountain peak in Greece . On arrival there , it was learned that the only means of entrance was by a basket in which a visitor , perilously suspended in mid-air , must be drawn up the wall of rock some hundreds of feet high . Indeed ! But that was an adventure not to be missed . A Queen stepped lightly into the basket , comfortably curled herself up , and gave the signal that hoisted her aloft . " Well , " laughs the Queen as Nicky finishes his story , " I 'm sure if I 'd been in Paradise like Eve , I too should have tasted the apple . And anyhow , I know Greece a lot better than Sophie , my cousin , once Queen there , ever did . Sophie , " concludes Marie , " never could stand fleas . " But the Queen of Rumania never has hesitated before reality . She never has shrunk from experience . And she knows her Rumania . It was as a young Crown Princess that she first rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her horse alone over mountain and plain . she went out to see the land that histon-had been holding for her coming . Since then she has ridden far . Oh , so far that she has indeed made this country her country ! Many a time , when another Queen might be sitting idly on a throne holding a scepter , you may find Marie of Rumania sitting on a low stool in some peasant 's cottage , learning all about the business of living . When she comes formally to her villages . as you have seen , they ring the church bells and hang out all the bright banners of their beautiful rugs in greeting . And the people kiss her hand , sometimes the hem of her skirt and even her feet , touching their foreheads to the ground in obeisance . At first , as she tells me , she did not know what to make of such homage . But as she herself became more eastern , she sas able to accept it graciously in the spririt of reverent @#  | adoration in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves enters more thoroughly than she into the festal spirit of these occasions made impressive with ancient manners and tradition . But the Queen likes also to come at times unheralded . As Marie of Rumania , with no ceremony to separate her , she may then gather her people close . Then it is , sitting on a low stool , she takes their black-eyed babies in her arms . And who knows better how to hold a baby to her bosom , to cuddle a small head in that divine hollow God made in her arm ! And with a sympathy that can overleap all caste , she clasps the hand of a woman in sorrow . She touches gently the bowed head of some unkempt , hairy , old man . She smiles into the happy eyes of young lovers . She counts a soldier 's medals . It 's marvelous how she never mixes their joys or their troubles . She knows the aches and pains and heart-throbs of each village from every other . She remembers unerringly which girl it is who is next to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees ; and at that house lives the man who is going blind . Especially always she remembers just how many children a woman has borne and how many buried . All these things , however , she lets them tell her over and over . And always she listens well , with that quiet patience which so eases aching hearts . FROM their lips , as she sat side by side with them like this , she told me , she first learned the Rumanian language . Word by word and phrase by phrase she picked it up . There is a trace of the Slavic , Bulgarian , and Turkish contacts through which it has come ; but it is a speech that has remained nevertheless largely Latin like its original source . These Rumanian peasants live uneventful lives except for the mysteries they meet in birth and death , and the two pageants prepared for them ih royalty and religion . Both the latter they like splendid with pomp and ceremony and colorful with custom . Of this the Queen of Rumania takes cognizance . Though no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of royalty , she keeps them carefully at hand for dress parade . Not only her people require that a ruler shall be ready to be regal , but she herself regards it as a duty . Serfdom , you see , is recent here . A sovereign is yet very near to God . And one 's " betters " not far below . Feudalism has so lately faded from the picture that it is not forgotten . Many of its fixings you find still retained in the accustomed gestures of every-day life . This is the land of Sarut mana , " I kiss the hand . " The custom is not confined to court circles . It is as commonly done as in America a man lifts his hat . You may not enter a drawing-room without its occurrence . Even in a newspaper office in Bucharest , when I made a professional call , the editor kissed my hand . And it is not only the courtesy that a man offers a woman . It is also a reverence expected from the peasants by the upper classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a servant , entering the room to make your bed , repeats in the accustomed apologetic murmur , " Sarut mane . " There are other quaint customs surviving in this very old world to make every-day affairs seem set for a play on the stage . Some thirtytwo saints ' days each year serve as occasion for making happy holiday . The gipsy musician for the village gets out his cobsa , and there begins the dance of the Hord , which is the real national amusement . Then there is the longer festival of the Rusali in August , a survival of the nature worship of the Greeks . The Rusali are three genii , who by three days of ceremonial observance may be placated so they f will not harm the crops . Other evil spirits are warded off when the village priest in satin vestments comes once a month to bless the  | house . From a basin of holy water held by an acolyte , he has sprinkled the doorway by means of a small whisk broom tied with a red ribbon . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , as the Lares and Penates protected the ancient Roman household , so the ikon guards the Rumanian family of today . In every house , set in a niche in the wall or on a bracket in the corner , you will find this replica of the chosen patron saint . before whom a lighted taper is kept ever burning . While ikon and ceremony are trusted to keep the household safe from harm , there may be emergencies that require other appeal . Are the crops , for instance , threatened With drought ? There is help for that . The mayor issues a call . And the villagers led by the ' priests , carrying sacred relics brought from the church , march about the fields to the chant of a Te Deum ; then all kneel in prayer for rain . Or if the drought , wide-spread , threatens to become the country 's calamity , there is one powerful to make direct intervention above . St. Dimitrie , five hundred years dead , in the Metropole on the hill in Bucharest , is a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully-wrought silver coffin , St. Dimitrie r is borne aloft in solemn procession through the streets of the city , while the people pray . Only three years ago there came a definite r answer . Scarcely had the splendidly robed procession returned with its sacred burden to the Metropole , when there occurred a downpour of rain that drenched a parched and thirsty land and made plenty in place of famine . Nor is it in Rumania only that the power of St. Dimitrie is recognized . The relic came , I believe , originally from Russia . And the Bulgarians so desired to have it that at the time of the occupation of Bucharest by the Central Powers during the war , they attempted t i to seize it . But they were foiled . " Stint " Dimitrie , the Rumanians triumphantly tell you , " made himself heavy . " So that all the soldiers who marched on the Metropole were unable to lift from the floor the massive silver coffin . It is a habit that " Sfint " Dimitrie has when he does not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to ask for rain , the saint has " made himself heavy " and refused . Could the coffin on these occasions have been nailed to the floor ? That 's an infidel idea which no true believer would entertain . THIS which is called the Greek Orthodox Church , is still as orthodox as when it started . And religion is a chief aspect of the country . Oh , how these people believe in God ! See the Rumanian peasant in prayer at the Metropole . Note the beauty of devotion as at length it comes to shine in his illumined face . He has dropped on his knees on the floor . His eyes are closed , his folded hands uplifted . His lips move silently , and he crosses himself . Now he postures until even his forehead touches the cold , stone floor in his deep abasement . Over and over like this he does his adoration . And at last it has occurred : see his face transfigured with the rapt look that reveals his soul 's attainment of complete communion with the infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-bearded priests in long , black gowns are ' swinging jeweled censers as they pass to and fro among the people . The soft light from stained glass windows enfolds the worshippers : on one side of the room are the men in embroidered sheep-skin coats , and on the other side , women in embroidered petticoats and with white-veiled or red-kerchiefed headdress . And side by side with these are others in plain store clothes . There are , too , some of the upper classes , men in black frock suits and women in costumes from Paris . Each worshipper , on entering , has lighted a wax taper . Now these countless tapers , set before the holy pictures , burn like so many flickering little golden stars of light . Wondrously wrought lamps of silver and gold , set @#  | with precious stones , hang from the ceiling , relieving the darkness of the high spaces . Through the rich gloom the ikonislas , the beautiful altar screen , flashes colorful and golden . Before its Holy Doors , as they open and close during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitre and stiff vestments of old brocade shimmering with gold and silver thread . And see , crowding every space of wall and pilaster and dome , the vast , pictured company of gold-haloed saints . As you glance upward into the deep well of the great dome , it seems literally as if heaven had opened and all its company were looking down on the congregation . Before this throng of witnesses generation after generation of men has unrolled the record of its soul , and the heartbreak and grief of the ages have gone up to God in prayer . Now listen to a church service unchanged for more than a thousand years . It is rhythmically intoned and musically chanted . There is no mechanical instrument . But the human voice alone gives sublime expression to the soul in music surpassing in majestic beauty that of any other faith . All the gamut of human emotions is run in measured cadences as the voices sink low in the despair of sin and sorrow and grief , only later to rise by stages in high aspiration to the exaltation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph proclaim , " Holy , Holy , Holy , Lord of Sabbaoth , heaven and earth are full of thy glory ! " The service closes . The worshipers file reverently in line before the altar to salute the wonder-working ikons with a holy kiss . And on the faces of all the common people , as they pass out into the porch , there is still reflected the glory of religion . yOU see how Rumania , with its embroidered peasants and its Byzantine churches , is like a colorful mosaic from some far yesterday . Somehow the ages seem to have missed it , as they went on their way making over the rest of the earth . Rumania is as old as that . But I would have you know that Rumania is new , too . I know of nowhere else in the world where medievalism so meets modernism coming right down Main Street . The Calea Victorei , the Avenue of Victory , as they named it after the troops came down it from Plevna , is the Fifth Avenue of Bucharest , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smart shops , the Cercle Militaire , the university that King Carol founded , the most pretentious residences and the Palatul Victorie , the Royal Victory Palace itself . And Bucharest , which Baedecker before the war listed with a population of some 300,000 , is now a city of nearly a million . Yet still down this fashionable Calea Victorei comes on occasion the splendid Sfiaat Dimitrie procession . And almost any day you may meet another with a band playing softly , wondrously , as only a Rumanian band can play , a slow , measured dirge ; men in silverbraided black coats and cocked hats , bearing aloft on long , black poles high , lighted lanterns ; priests in robes of vivid color and tall purple hats ; in front of the procession , two carrying between them on a great silver platter the " coliva , " which is really the funeral cake of Virgil ; and in the hearse , drawn by four horses hooded to their eyes and covered to their heels with a black velvet panoply , the passenger who rides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coin . It is the coin once required by Charon for ferry fare across the Styx , but now by adaptation intended for St. Peter at the gates of heaven . So , in a land picturesque with ceremony , ancient custom survives . Still down this same Main Street today , too , the slow-moving ox-cart takes its even way , with a white-smocked peasant in a black sheepskin hat holding the reins over the backs of his great , yoked animals . And the low , swinging carriage , the birja , remains a customary public conveyance , with a driver , the  | birjar , clad always in a blue velvet mantle falling full-skirted to his ankles and encircled at his ample waist-line with a silken sash in red or pink or maybe sky-blue . Now , there have also arrived as many motor cars as in any other twentieth century city . And Bucharest has the most convenient line of motor busses , operated by a man from New York , that I have seen anywhere in the world . But note that at these strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare solemnly . And the birjar behind his lean , little horse looks contemptuously . Both , you see , have been here so long before . Between them , let the automobiles with their clanging horns dodge as best they may . " Hopi , " calls a blue-velveted birjar , and all entanglement of traffic makes way at his command . But sometimes down the street comes a polished mahogany car ; to this both the white-smocked peasant and the bluevelveted birjar , bending low with uncovered heads , do a beautiful , profound obeisance . And all the lean little horses and the great , white , yoked oxen stop in their tracks , while a lovely Lady , wearing about her head the white nrarama , passes by with a smile and a wave of her hand . The sumptuous car turns in at the Palatul Victorie . Modernism is leading medievalism happily right at tier chariot wheels . IT has been all at the wave of a woman 's hand . Scarcely ever has the Queen 's scepter moved at all . But from out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavements the centuries have trod , is emerging today a changing city . Already the apartment house begins to elbow the old Rumanian residence of Arabesque architecture . Among the two- and three-story buildings are rising those of six and seven , a new city hall , an imposing railroad station , a large and beautiful university building to replace the earlier smaller one . Western culture is coming . In moving pictures , right here on the Calea Victorii , Emerson Hough 's " Covered Wagon " has brought the Browns , the Kents , and the Woodilelds for these eastern folk to know . American typewriters , American plows , American shoes , American cars are announced in the store windows . The Hotel Athenee Palace has American bath tubs and American heat . And see , across its front an illuminated sign that proclaims the last word in up-to-date equipment , " Bar American . " Well , at the Bar American have been put across some of the great business deals of the world . Captains of finance on the trail of oil are registered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hotel manager who speaks French , the polite language here of the upper classes . Mirzah , the tall Turk , smiling first with his hand on his heart , has then bent low to receive on his back their luggage . The elevator man who has brought them up in the " lift " has called out the floor in German . A maid may make their beds in Hungarian . A boy very likely blacks their shoes in Russian . When they must know what all of these are talking about , it is Constantine , the porter at the front entrance , who can tell . He says it , too , in perfectly good American that came from Youngstown , Ohio . Once he worked there in the steel mills , before he was caught up in the whirlwind of war to be flung back here on his native soil . Rumania has , as you may discover , a diverse population today . Some of its numerous minorities are of recent acquisition . When the Queen of Rumania had finished with that peace conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other languages than their mother tongue . And her capital city begins now to reflect the prosperity flowing to it from a kingdom increased by an area rich in oil and minerals . But variegated as it may be with recent additions of territory , this land remains distinctively  | early Roman in character . And 8o percent of its population are to be found among the peasants . There are also the upper classes of 99 Rumania , highly educated , sophisticated , polished with a Paris contact . With their great estates in the country and their city houses at Jassy or at Bucharest , they usually spend also some months each year in that city ' of France which is the world 's capital of culture . There are twenty which are called the " real first families , " who are direct descendants of the early ruling Princes . Some two hundred more have come from the old Boyar landed gentry . Added to these are about one thousand other families who are also included among Rumania 's aristocracy . NOW , it was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply drawn . About herself you feel that there is something fine and primeval . See , in her red slippers and her swinging embroidered skirt , how she steps off with the dignity and the freedom of a peasant . Like them she loves the sweet smell of the ground after rain , and all of the wide out-of-doors . She knows intimately the forests and the plains and the grain fields and the long , dusty roads . And every picturesque custom and tradition she has absorbed and come to understand . It was to the cottages she turned at first . But neither has she missed the castle halls . Through old Moldavia and the Bucovina , when we went in that private Tren Regale , we stopped at Some of the great estates . I saw her admire in their drawing-rooms their rugs and their tapestries and the ancestral painted portraits of the turbaned Boyars on their walls . She sat on their stone terraces framed with formal flower beds and clipped yew trees , with the cool , silvery sound of falling water in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Turkish coffee and their Rumanian liqueurs . She walked through their vineyards up and down all the long lines of the vines , tasting every variety of grape , the red ones and the blue and the purple and the golden green ones . She lingered in their gardens , those marvelous gardens unrolled in carpets of color that seemed to stretch in acres of landscape bloom . And she held their children , too , in her arms . We came to a christening . It was in that Bucovina so lately acquired from Austria , ' where the population , though 6o percent Rumanian , is still 40 percent Slay . The baby had been born to an Austrian Count of Italian origin and his wife , a Russian Princess who had fled from the Bolsheviks . Both are now , through the change in political circumstance , Rumanian subjects . And the Queen had come to stand godmother to their child . Garlands of evergreens and bright Rumanian flags made a festive background . There was first a great banquet with rare viands served on china that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titled relatives crowding about the Queen with the baby in her arms , came the Roman Catholic baptismal rite . Tiny , little fingers had clasped tightly and happily the priceless string of pearls and emeralds that hung from Her Majesty 's throat . The priest in his vestments stepped forward . At the first contact with the holy water he sprinkled , there arose an angry scream of protest . But the Queen gathered the whiteembroidered bundle close to murmur soft comfort , " There , there , is it then so terrible a thing to be made a Christian ? " And I noticed how deftly she held to her bosom Marie Dorothea Isabella Elizabetha Eugenia , daughter of Count D S R , who once had been an alien enemy . Now , that was characteristic of the Queen . " How can the baby help the war ? " she declared as we drove away . Earlier in the day some of her entourage , who had learned of her intention , had whispered in protest , " But , Your Majesty , the @#  | family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " promptly responded the Queen , " if that is so , all the more reason why the baby should be baptised as Rumanian as it can be . " Later , to the royal court at Siniai , she an-nounced : " Since we are now all here together , I have something to say . As you all very well know , when I am planning to do anything that may cause a row I do it first and talk about it afterward . Well , yesterday I was godmother at a christening . " Then she went on detailing all about the alien ancestry and the whispered protest . " Anyhow , " she concluded , " I 've sponsored that child as a Christian , and now it 's done . As my godchild , I venture she 'll grow up a true patriot . And her family , I now feel , is as Rumanian as any of the oldest Moldavian line . I know what I am doing . " Ah , so much that another sovereign might never know nor ever understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royalist that she was born , she must of course remain . " I do not believe in equality , " she says . 1 " God makes one class higher than another . Some of us have been born to high place . Mine happens to be the highest of all . But God put me here . And if I were to resign my job tomorrow , who could do it better ? Certainly not my maid . And it would be even unkind to impose on her tasks to which she is not equal and for which she is totally unprepared . How , for instance , would she like , being obliged to receive a Metropolitan or a diplomat ? Why , she 'd be even more uncomfortable than I should be sewing on my own buttons . For both of us it would be utter ' folly that we should turn about in any such fashion . " On the other hand it does humiliate me to need so much service that I require twentythree people standing round to wait on me . But there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't myself hands enough to do them all . Now , I do not believe in equality , but there is such a thing as justice . It is not fair for one class to have all the hard times in life and another class more than its share of comfort . So what can we who are higher up do to make life easier for the others ? That is the question with which we are now confronted . By way of compensation , if I am a person requiring so much service , then I must find some way to give in return for what I receive . I must give , too , that which people want . My people are a peasant people . What they want , I have discovered , is land ? " Oh , Rumania is as you have seen , as old as its origin . But it is new , too , as new as its future . Have you heard of the agrarian legislation that is rushing evolution here where otherwise revolution might be running red ? Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with tomorrow . Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown ! Hers does n't . Baptising their babies , walking their vineyards , visiting their churches , revering their ikons , sitting in cottages , and soothing sorrows ! And partitioning the land ! These people , she has made her people .
