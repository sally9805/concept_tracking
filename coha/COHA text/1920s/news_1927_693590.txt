txt Figures of Debt Reduction . In his letter in this morning 's Timms , Mr. T. David Zuckerman entirely misses the point of my letter of a couple of days ago . That letter was not a , criticism of Mr. Mellon. but of Mark Sullivan 's article in The World 's Work . I took the figures as he gave them , and pointed out one amazing error  --  the ascription to Mr. Mellon of all debt reduction from Jan. 1 , 1920 , though President Harding 's term did not begin until March 4 , 1921  --  but the main purport of my letter was that the mere figures of debt reduction without examination of the underlying facts furnished no ' ground for adulation of Mr. Mellon as the personal hero of a great financial achievement . Mr. Zuckerman now points out another error  --  the use of the figures of gross debt instead of net debt  --  and he ascribes that error to me ; but the error was Mr. Sullivan's. not mine . He says that I " Insist " that the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 31. 1920 , under Mr. Mellon 's predecessors , while the best Mr. Mellon was able to do was to reduce it by $2,100,000.000 in the following three years . I did not " insist " on anything of the kind ; I merely pointed out that such was the showing of Mr. Sullivan 's own figures . And it was evident from the whole tenor of my letter that my point here was that it would be silly to infer from this allowing that Mr. Mellon 's predecessors were abler than he . FABIAN FRANK-LIN .
