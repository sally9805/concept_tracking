The new $5,000,000 corporation formed by Great Britain for the expansion of her airways has under consideration a plan for expediting urgent transatlantic mail . Under this scheme urgent letters- on payment of special rates-will be carried in a specially constructed seaplane , capable of a speed of 120 miles an hour , to overtake liners which have left New York harbor for English ports . Guided by wireless , the seaplane will alight near a liner and be hoisted aboard . The wings are to be of the folding type , which reduces considerably the space required for storing . When the ship is still hundreds of miles from the English coast the plane will be hoisted overboard and will fly away with the mail .
