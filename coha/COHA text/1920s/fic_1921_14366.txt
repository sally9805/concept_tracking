At the right front of the living-room of the Boling girls ' home is a dilapidated dresser with a cracked mirror ; and at the back on the right a door leads into " the entry " and kitchen . A cheap bed stands in the corner . A door in the center rear opens into a narrow hall-way , and directly across the hall another door opens into the parlor . To the left of the rear door is a large chest , and above it hang several dresses , a cloak or two , and women 's hats . At the left center is a well-worn trun : . A door near the left front opens to the outdoors . In the middle of the room is a small table , a lighted lamp on it . The room is unceiled , and the walls planked up and down . A typical dwelling of the better negro class . LORINA and ILA BOVING , two young mulatto girls , are putting the finishing touches to their toilette . LORINA is dressed in a dark-colored georgette waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is a rather pretty girl of about seventeen with an oval face , mischievous eyes , and lips a little too full . She stands before the mirror tying a pink ribbon on her hair . Now and then she rubs powder on her face with a dirty chamois skin . ILA is sitting on the edge of the bed lacing her shoes . She is dressed like LORINA , except that she wears a blue waist . For a moment she raises her head and sits staring absently before her . She is stouter than LORINA , her face less intelligent but more honest . LORINA ImpatientlyWhat ln the world ails you , a-settin there asleep ? ILA makes no answer . Do n't you know it 's ' bout time they 's all here ? She takes a can of powder and sprinkles her neck and shoulders . Then by catching hold of her waist , she shakes the powder over her body. p. 3 ILA Lacing her shoes and speaking in a lazy , mellow voice:You must got a idea to charm Wiley Boy , a-puttin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again rubs her face with the chamois skin She begins to clean her nails with a hairpin . LORINA Never you mind . ' Tai n't for me to hoe cotton all the week and then not make use of Sad'd'y night for a good time when it does come . Yeh , charm Wiley Boy or not charm ' im . She begins singing in a high clear voice . " O mister engineer , I 'm a-goin ' away from here  --  I 'm a-goin ' down to Alabam ; Goin ' to see my man . " And the engineer , he say "  --  She whirls on her toes toward ILA . Here , I looks all right , do n't I ? ILA Yeh , you looks all right  --  and you gits around powerful spry . But if you as tired as I was , you 'd quit that messin . She gets up and goes lazily over toward the dresser . Reeny , I ai n't much tuck with this here prayer-meetin ' .

And we can git away with it at a prayer-meetin ' . p. 4 ILA That 's all right , but you ought a told her somethin ' ' bout it . You ought a  --  LORINA Aw , told her ! And then got her stirred up and had her on our hands with one of her ligious spells ? Naw ! ILA She 'll be tore up when she does find it out . LORINA Two n't matter then , we 'll be a-havin the fun . What can she do when she comes and finds us already goin ' on with it ? ILA But she 's wore out with us a-makin ' free with the men , and  --  I do n't know  --  I do n't like to hurt her no more  --  her with her proud folks ' notions bout ' spectability , and she gittin old and childish . LORINA Half-angrily:Now you allus startin ' up that talk . Folks 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-hortin ' with each other . And if he is a preacher , plenty of ' em knows how he is with the women . ILA Well , what 's he to Wiley Boy , him and his car and his liquor ? LORINA grins and turns to look in the mirror . He 's the worst nigger in the country , and she hates ' m worse'n a coach-whup . LORINA Tai n't no matter if he is lak that . She ai n't got no call to be lookin down on im so ' cause he 's a fast nigger . Times is changed . Young folks is goin to have pleasure this day and time . p. 5 ILA Yeh , but this wo n't always be  --  LORINA Continuing:She got all her high-falutin notions from them old days of belongin ' to the white folks . Vehemently . I wish she 'd move up there and stay with Mr. Archie for good . ILA Gloomily:I hope she 'll do it after tonight . She 's slam drug out with us . LORINA Bitterly:I bet she 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night . She looks at the clock . She waits on ' em lak a slave and do n't git no thanks . White folks allus a-looking down on you . She picks up her dirty clothes and crams them under the bed covering , and then kicks their working shoes under the bed . ILA And yet , I know she ai n't going to leave us long as Angie hangs around here . LORINA After a moment:Where 's he ? ILA Absently rubbing her face:Who ? LORINA Who ! Why  --  Angie ! Who you think I 's talking ' bout ? What can ail your mind ? ILA Oh , I do n't know where he is . I ai n't seed ' im since ' bout a hour ago . He put on his clean clothes and went down the road  --  said he 'd be  --  back after while . p. 6 LORINA It 's time them folks was comin ' . I 'll light up the parlor . She gives herself a final look in the mirror , bending close to examine her white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the hall and into the parlor . She lights the lamp and sets the graphaphone playing " The Preacher and the Bear . " She comes back in with two or three roses in her hand . ILA goes on with her dressing . ILA Tying up her hair:Who all s comin , Reeney ? LORINA Pinning a rose at her waist:Brother Day 'll be here , of course . He 's the main character . And Uncle Jerry and Wesley and Garfield . Uncle Haywood told me yistiddy he 'd be here , but he ' o n't come though . He 's scared of her . And then Lina 'll be here , I reckon , and Wiley Boy you can bet . There is the sound of a buggy outside . There 's some of ' em now . She goes into the parlor , leaving the door open behind her . ILA finishes dressing hurriedly . The door at the left front opens and ANGIE enters . He stops just inside the door and looks quizzically at ILA . He is a slight Negro of twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and khaki shirt , black necktie and gray cap . There is something childish and irresponsible , something pathetic in his face that suggests the close need of protection . He stands unsteadily , now and then moving his feet to keep his balance. p. 7 ILA Suspiciously:Where you been , Angie ? We thought ' t was some of them folks for the meetin ' . She looks at him searchingly . He eyes her blankly . What you been doin ' , Angie ? You ai n't been messin ' with  --  ANGIE Waving his hand with dignity , and speaking thickly:No , I ai n't !

LORINA Coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come , and it 's a caution she ai n't . You been drinking again after all your promises . Sardonically . Poor little Angie ! Granny 's pet . Ca n't you let a Sad'd'y night go by without gittin ' drunk ? Laughing at him in scorn . She 'll come in and find it out  --  you a-foolin ' her with your promises . p. 8 ANGIE Hotly:What you mean ? You and Ila  --  ai n't the kin  --  d to go preachin ' to me  --  you and Wiley Boy and Joe Day . He laughs unsteadily . A note of tenderness comes into his voice . You tell her I 'm a-goin ' over over to the stor  --  re and Waving his hand indefinitely in the direction of the road.  --  and git er some snuff .

He measures with his hands . He stands as if undecided what to do . LORINA Well , what you want ? ANGIE Embarrassed:Nothin ' . Then quickly as if he had thought of something . Yeh , I want to git some change out'n my overalls . He goes carefully across the room into the entry. p. 9 LORINA Well , what you want ? ANGIE Embarrassed:Nothin ' . Then quickly as if he had thought of something . Yeh , I want to git some change out'n my overalls . He goes carefully across the room into the entry . LORINA Sticking a rose in her hair:What a fool he is ! He 's goin ' to the devil as well as us . But  --  well , let him go . She stands looking in the mirror and singing . " John Henry had a purty little wife , The dress she wore was red.She got upon the railroad trackAnd never did look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Goin ' where my man fell dead .

He walks stealthily past ILA without looking at her . ILA Look here , Angie , I know what you up to . You go put it back . She catches hold of his arm . ANGIE Jerking away from her:Hush up ! Do n't a man need a little ' tection on the road these nights A laughing impatient voice calls from the outside. p. 10 VOICE Hey , Angie ! ' O n't the old woman let you go ? ANGIE There 's Charlie , tired of waitin ' for me , Damn im ! Callin her the " old woman ! " LORINA Coming in at the rear:Let ' im alone , Ila . Let ' im go on and tote his gun . First thing he knows he 'll land in jail . And what 'll she say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go on ! ANGIE Angrily:Yeh , yeh . Keep on . Sentimentally . None of us is fit for her . You with your prayer-meetin 's , and no ' ligion ' bout it . Sneeringly . You and Wiley Boy  --  He turns toward ILA , shivering and speaking in a shrill voice . Ila , Gus Turner 's a-layin ' up for me , and I ai n't goin ' be no coward . I got to ' tect myself . VOICE From the outside:Whoa ! ca n't ye ! Angie ! if you a-goin ' , come on ! ANGIE Turning to go:You tell ' er  --  He stands blinking at ILA uncomprehendingly . A childish look comes over his face as if he did n't know just what he had been doing . He smiles weakly . Then suddenly , wrath at a fancied grievance sweeps over him , and his eyes begin to shine . He starts towards ILA . I see what you after . Damn you ! Do n't you tell er I  --  I  --  been a-drinkin ! Quavering . You allus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tryin to turn ' er agin me. p. 11 ILA Disgustedly:Aw go on ' I ai n't goin ' to tell er . Keep on with your triflin ! She 'll be done of you some these days . The hurt look comes back over his face . Then he grins , showing his white teeth . ANGIE Boyishly:Tell er I 'm a-comin right back , and I 'm goin ' to bring ' er a present . LORINA Stretching her arms above her head: I wish to God you 'd go on , Angie ! I do n't want you to be around here a-smellin ' of liquor when she comes . And she 'll be here in a little while , too . ANGIE Glaring at her:You speaks lak that to me , and Wiley Boy allus soaked when he gits a chance ! You low-down  --  LORINA Go on , I say . Git out'n here . I heard a car cross the bridge on the creek a few minutes ago , and they 'll be here in a minute . Git out . He stands blinking at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound of voices outside is heard . Two or three blows with a stick , and then the roar of wheels and the galloping of a mule . CHARLIE and ANGIE are heard singing , their voices growing faint and fainter : " Come along , O children , come along , While the moon shines bright.Oh , we 'll take a boatAnd down the river float  --  Gwine raise the rucas tonight . " The refrain floats back on the wind . " Gwine raise the rucas tonight . Gwine raise the rucas tonight . " In the meantime LORINA has surveyed herself several times in the mirror , putting on a string of beads and moving nervously about the room . A whippoorwill sings in the hollow back of the house . And then there is the chir  --  r  --  rp of a mocking-bird in the tree near the door . ILA has sat down in a chair at the table , looking before her . She shivers when she hears the whippoorwill. p. 12 LORINA Git up , Ila , and finish dressing yourself . You ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a sight for speed when it comes to fixin ' up . ILA Abstractedly:Granny says they 's signs in whippoorwills , Reeny . LORINA Christ A'mighty ! You 're too big a fool to ' sociate with the men . Why ai n't they signs in that mocking-bird , then ? Hurry up ! There they is now . A Ford stops outside . ILA begins brushing her shoes . LORINA goes out at the rear and stops the graphophone . WILEY BOY and BROTHER DAY are seen entering the parlor . LORINA Good evening , Wiley Boy ! Good evening Brother Day ! Laughing . Here you is with your Bible . And Wiley Boy 's brought ' is box . WILEY BOY In a young flattering voice , strumming his guitar:Good evening , Reeny . Yeh , we wants a little real music . Lord , look at them flowers ! Ai n't she a show , Brother Day ? Haw ! Haw ! BROTHER DAY In a deep , oily voice:Good evening , Sister Reeny . How 's you ? WILEY BOY We 's spectin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t' other side the creek . I swear you all sot for the meetin . Uh ? ILA finishes dressing and shakes out her skirt. p. 13 BROTHER DAY We 's here a little early , ai n't we ? LORINA I 'm glad you is . We got some cake and pickles and stuff fixed up for you . I 'll go git it now ' fore t'others come . She comes back into the room just as ILA starts out . ILA , go on in and entertain ' em . ILA Grinning:Do n't seem lak they 's goin ' to need no entertainin ' . As WILEY BOY and BROTHER DAY come crowding into the room . WILEY BOY puts his arm around LORINA as he comes in . WILEY BOY How you , Ila ? BROTHER DAY Well , here we is . How you , Ila ? ILA I 'm all right . WILEY BOY is a tall lithe young negro of twenty-two or three , black and greasy looking , with something of the " sport " about him . He wears a light checkered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie and white collar . A spray of bridal wreath hangs from the lapel of his coat . His hair is cropped close . His big pop-eyes are bold and rolling . BROTHER DAY is a heavy-set negro of thirty or more , dressed in a dark suit , the cut of his coat being inclined to the swallow tail . He wears a celluloid collar with no tie , baggy trousers , and shoes that need repairing . His forehead is low , his small eyes deep-set and close together . His whole appearance suggests a pious sensuality and cupidity , a lover of good chicken dinners and plump hostesses . He retains ILA 'S hand after greeting her. p. 14 BROTHER DAY You 'll excuse us , I 'm sho ' . But me'n Wiley Boy 's at home in here . We knows this room purty well . Winking at WILEY BOY . Uneasily . The old woman ai n't about  --  uh ? ILA Freeing her hand:Not yit , but she 's liable to come any minute . WILEY BOY Patting LORINA 'S cheek:Who minds the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She do n't faze me none when I 's out for a good time . Come on , le 's git de grub , Reeny . They go into the entry laughing . WILEY BOY with his arm still around LORINA . He leans over her as they go across the room . Uh ! uh ! Honey , you sho ' smells good . LORINA slaps him playfully on the cheek . ILA and the parson sit on the bed . She looks anxiously now and then toward the door at the left . BROTHER DAY Catching ILA by the chin and turning her face towards him:Now , look here , honey , what 's the trouble with you ? What makes you act so distant ? Aw , come on . He tries to draw her to him . There is a resounding whack in the entry , and LORINA is heard saying : LORINA Wait a while , wo n't you ! She comes in laughing , with cake and pickles on a waiter , WILEY BOY following. p. 15 BROTHER DAY Give you a slap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . Slowly he takes his arm from around ILA . WILEY BOY Damn you ! Put a brake on that laugh , wo n't you He goes over to LORINA , sweeps her to him , and kisses her several times in spite of herself . Now , there ! As he releases her . LORINA Set down and eat these her victuals , and do n't be such a hog . She slices up the cake and passes it around with the pickles . Footsteps and voices are heard outside . There 's all of ' em now . I hear Uncle Jerry 's voice . Come on and leave ' em alone . Let Brother Day look after Ila and the eatin 's . They finish eating their cake hurriedly and go out , closing the door . What takes place in the parlor can be heard only indistinctly , a sort of medley of songs and words , as the play goes on . Lorina 's voice is heard : " Heigho , all of you ! Good evenin ' Uncle Jerry , " followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S voice : " Howdy , Meta . How you , Garfield , and how you , Wes ? " " Very well , thank'y , how you ? " and so on . The graphophone is started again with " The Preacher and the Bear . " And the conversation dies into a hum , now and then punctuated with loud guffaws and the shrill cackle of a delighted woman . Left alone , BROTHER DAY still sits on the bed . His cake giving out , he goes over to the table and cuts off a huge slice . He stands irresolutely for a moment and then sits down in a chair near the table , eating in huge mouthfuls. p. 16 BROTHER DAY We 's goin ' to make the meetin ' short tonight , honey . Wiley Boy 's goin ' take us over the river to git some ice cream . ILA I ai n't goin ' nowhere with Wiley Boy and he been drinkin ' . Liable to kill somebody . BROTHER DAY He ai n't got ' nough to hurt . He looks around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room almost in darkness . Then he gets up and comes over to ILA , patting her on the cheek . Look here , what ails you , gal ? ILA Nothin ' cept I 'm tired of all this . When we goin git married ? BROTHER DAY Embarrassed:What 's that ? I ai n't  --  ILA I 'm gittin ' tired of these carryin ' - ons . I wants to be ' spectable lak other folks , and you promised me ' nough . And I wants  --  He is so taken aback that he sits down in a chair . BROTHER DAY Yeh , I knows I 's promised . After a moment . Here , I tell you , we 'll talk it over tonight on the ride . Yeh , we 'll fix it , Sullenly . The old woman 's been after you , agin ai n't she ? ILA That 's all right about that . If she did , I reckon she had a right to . Earnestly . Joe , I 'm tired of this messin ' round and havin ' folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch some other girls mentioned your name , and then all of ' em ' gin to snigger and look at me. p. 17 BROTHER DAY Angrily:Now , here , you never mind ' em . They 's the ungodly , they is . We 'll fix it to-night , honey . We 'll talk it over . He reaches for more cake . ILA ( Bowing her head and speaking bitterly : ) Yeh , talk it over . That 's all you ever do ' cept  --  ( He comes and sits beside her , putting his arm around her . ) BROTHER DAY Talk is right , honey . Talk is right . It 's a question that needs consideration . Gallantly . Le 's forgit it . Chile , you sho ' looks unctious in all this finery . Fingering her waist . The door opens noiselessly and GRANNY BOLING enters . In the dim light she fails to see ILA and BROTHER DAY . She is a little straight old woman of seventy-five or more , dressed in ordinary working clothes . Her face is hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mumbles to herself as she closes the door softly behind her . GRANNY Her voice rising tremulous and husky:Listen dah ! Listen dah ! Mah po ' chilluns . She stands listening to the merriment in the parlor without seeing ILA and BROTHER DAY . ' S da'k heah . I 's lost ! I 's lost . Marse John , Marse John ! Whah you , Marse John ? Yo ' ol ' mammy done turned ' way from dem she loves . She starts towards the entry , calling in a quavering voice . Angie ! You heah , boy ? Brokenly . I needs you , Angie . I needs you , boy . I 's gut trouble to tell you . She lays her package on the bed as ILA rises up between her and BROTHER DAY . Ah !  --  Who 's dat !  --  p. 18 ILA Stammering:Nobody but me , Granny . GRANNY Ily , Ily ! Mr. Archie done turned me down  --  Says I 's too ol ' to work . Angie . Angie Looking around her . What 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turns it up , all the time muttering to herself . She takes off her bonnet and hangs it on a chair . The light shows up , her kind , ignorant face . She is black , of pure African descent . Behind her spectacles are eyes not quite intelligent enough for this world , but withal , there is something sad and forlorn about her  --  something stately . She is respectable . BROTHER DAY makes a movement as if to slip into the entry . ILA motions to him to be still . ILA Helplessly:Yeh , but  --  Granny , never mind that . You got a place here . GRANNY Turning proudly towards her:I ai n't gut no place heah . Dis ain ' mayh home . Listen dah ! Listen dah ! WILEY BOY 'S laugh is heard above the delirious graphophon . Who 's you ! Who  --  Starting back as she sees BROTHER DAY . With a movement of her hand she pushes her spectacles up into her white hair . BROTHER DAY slips swiftly to his feet and edges toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? ILA throws out her arms sullenly. p. 19 BROTHER DAY Moving towards the door and smiling his conversion smile:Miss Bolin ' , we 's just preparin ' to have service in your house , as the Lawd advised . And Miss Ila and me  --  we 's just been talkin ' bout the best way of conductin it . Here the merriment in the parlor grows louder . And the graphophone starts again with " Negro Blues . " GRANNY What dis man doin ' in dis room ? Looking around her . Angie , whah 's you ? BROTHER DAY slips out at the rear , leaving the door partially open . What you mean , Ily ? ILA We 's just gittin ' some cake , Granny . GRANNY What 's all dis bout ? Mo ' prayer-meetin wid dis low-down trash ? ILA Come on git your supper . Defiantly . Reeny 's the one got it up . The graphophone stops , and BROTHER DAY is heard speaking . BROTHER DAY Brothren and sisters , it 's time to start the meetin ' , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LORINA Calling to him in her mocking voice:Where 's your Bible , Brother Day ? Where 's your Bible ? Yeh , I 'll get it for you . A heavy voice begins singing , other voices joining in until the Negro spiritual is in full swing. p. 20 LEADER Singing : " Do n't you want to go there ? " ALTOS AND SOPRANOS " In my Father 's house . " LEADER " Do n't you want to go there ? " ALL " In my Father 's house there is peace , peace . " Second Stanza : " Yes , I 'm goin ' to go there . " Third Stanza : " My old mother 's gone there . " And so on , with exclamations now and then of " O Lord ! Lord Jesus ! " and BROTHER DAY crying out , " Jesus ! Lordy my Lord ! " In the meantime GRANNY and ILA have kept on with their dialogue . GRANNY How come Reeny to do that ? She promised to quit foolin roun wid dat Wiley Boy . LORINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes her head defiantly , picks up the Bible and starts out . GRANNY plucks at her dress . Reeny , chile , you  --  GRANNY LORINA jerks free and goes out . GRANNY mumbles to herself and begins humming a strange tune , tapping on the floor with her stick:Um !  --  um-um-um  --   --  um-ah-um ! Um !  --  um-um-um  --   --  um-ah-um ILA Listen at that music . They ca n't be no harm in that , is they ? And sides they 's Uncle Jerry and Meta goin on with it . p. 21 GRANNY Dey 's just blasphemin ' . You knows dey ai n't gut no ligion deep down in dey hearts . Dey 's just a-puttin on . ILA leans against the bed-post in weariness . GRANNY starts towards a chair near the table . She stops and looks sadly at ILA . I 's tried to keep you spectable all my life , and you jest keep foolin wid dese low-down men . She looks vacan ly around her , humming under her breath . Um !  --  um-um-um  --   --  ILA Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quair ways . Let me git you some supper . GRANNY Not noticing her:And when I works hard all de week and wants a place of rest to come to , I finds you all messed up wid dis heah trash . Whah 's Angie ? ILA He 's gone to the store .

ILA Ironically:Yeh , he give you ' is word . And he ai n't never fooled you . GRANNY sits down near the dresser and takes out her snuff-box and brush . I 'll bring your supper . I reckon you 's tired out . She picks up the lamp and goes out at the right . The room is left in semi-darkness . The door in the rear opens craftily and LORINA sticks her head in. p. 22 LORINA Softly:Come on . They 've gone in the kitchen . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the light from the parlor . The music grows louder , and UNCLE JERRY can be seen slapping his face and patting the floor with his foot , keeping time . WILEY BOY closes the door . WILEY BOY Don ' be playin ' wid me now . Git de dough . There is a sound of the chest 's being opened ; then a jingling of coins . Aw , come on now ! LORINA That 's all I got , I tell you . There is the sound of a kiss in the dark , and LORINA laughs . You bad fellow . What makes you keep a-drinkin ' ? WILEY BOY Tai n't no time for talkin ' now . Business . Say , you goin ' with me on the trip after the meetin ' ? We can leave Brother Day and Ila over at the sto ' . And then you and me . Uh ? LORINA Yeh , I 'm with you .

Somebody called my name ! Hush ! hush ! Somebody called my name "  --  ILA comes in unexpectedly , carrying food on a plate . LORINA pulls the door to when she sees GRANNY. p. 23 ILA Angrily:What you doin ' in here ? She looks accusingly at LORINA as she sets the lamp on the table . GRANNY sits bolt upright , staring at LORINA and WILEY BOY . He takes his arm from around her , laughing . WILEY BOY Why'n hell did n't you tell me she was in here , Ila ? LORINA Aw , come on , Wiley Boy , time for Brother Day to start the sperience meetin . The music is heard in a roll of fervor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Jesus ! my name !

He blows a whirl of smoke toward the ceiling . Then grasping LORINA around the waist he pulls her through the door and slams it aft r him . GRANNY stands for a moment looking around her . Then she sinks into a chair , humming meaninglessly : " Um !  --  um  --  um  --  . " p. 24 ILA Impatiently:Do n't set to your crazy ways agin . I say . Eat your supper . Mournfully . No use you feelin ' bad ' bout us . You 's ' spectable and we ai n't . GRANNY I do n't want none of yo ' supper . Go on and leave me .

The old woman stirs uneasily and hums again . Um  --  um  --  um  --  Whah 's mah boy ! ILA Turning back impatiently:I told you he 's gone to the sto ' . He 'll be back in a little while . The pounding of feet on the floor in the parlor causes the door at the rear to swing slightly open . The music stops , and voices are heard calling to WILEY BOY : " Le 's have a piece by Wiley Boy ! Wiley and ' is box . Amen ! " Silence for a moment and then he begins playing his guitar and singing : " Gim me a piece of cornbread in my hand.See Aunt Dinah.Sop my way to the Promise ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , pounding with their feet and clapping with their hands .

All of us has many things to thank the Lord for . " Voices reply : " Amen ! Hallelujah , brother ! " UNCLE JERRY begins : " I wants to thank the Lawd for what he 's done for me . " Audience : " Uh  --  huh ! That man knows the Scriptures . " ILA pulls the door closed and stands as if undecided whether to go or stay . The noise of the meeting is heard indistinctly .

She goes out slowly , closing the door behind her . As she passes through the door , the ges'iculating figure of UNCLE JERRY can be seen , his ecstatic audience swaying with him as he relates how the Lord saved him from his sins . He is chanting : " And brothren and sisters , the Lawd said to me . Hah ! Jerry ! Jerry ! hah ! You got to change yo life ! ' " Audience : " Amen ! Glory ! " Here ILA closes the door. p. 26 GRANNY She sits gazing blankly at the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a throaty sob into song : " And I seed a light a-shinin ' , and it said to me  --  And I seed a cloud a-risin ' in the West , and it said to me  --  And de mountain tuck fiah , and de peoples shouted , anddey said to me  --  Dey 's a sign , Lawd Jesus , a sign ! " She rises and stands as if under the spell of some supernatural power , her voice rising almost to a wail : " And de night come up , and de sun went down , And dey said a sign , a sign , Lawd Jesus , a sign ! " She remains motionless , her lips working silently . There is the sound of running feet . The door at the left front flies open , and ANGIE dashes in . His eyes are staring bright with horror , his coat torn , his shirt ripped open . With a cry , he stumbles towards GRANNY . ANGIE Granny ! Granny ! He falls on his knees , throwing his arms around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep ' em off me ! Keep ' em off ! GRANNY Joyfully:I 's glad you 's come . I needs you , boy . I needs you .

What 's it ? She strokes his forehead . What 's de trouble , boy ? ANGIE He springs to his feet and looks wildly around him:Granny ! Granny ! They 's after me ! They 's after me ! GRANNY Starting up in alarm:What 's dat ? What 's dat ? ANGIE looks around as if expecting someone to jump out of the shadows at him . ANGIE Shuddering and clinging to GRANNY : Save me ! Save me ! I hear em comin ! GRANNY Clutching his arm:What 's dat , Angie ? What you done ? Trying to look him in the face . ANGIE He made at me with a knife , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pointing a trembling hand at the dark entry door . JERRY 'S voice is heard in an ecstasy of glory : " And de Lawd said , ' Jerry !

He falls on his knees and buries his head in her apron as she sits down again . She looks blankly before her . BROTHER DAY is heard crying out : " Yea ! brethren and sisters , who 'll be next ! That 's right , Sister Meta , tell us your ' sperience with the Lord . " All grows quiet , save for the heavy breathing of ANGIE and the far-off drone of the woman testifying unto her God . ANGIE In a low , frightened voice:O Granny , do n't let ' em git at me ! GRANNY Sadly:Boy , I 's loved you and prayed for you since you was a baby and yo ' mammy and pappy died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done mu'der , boy , and nothin ' ca n't save you .

She goes on dreamily . I 's lived a long time , boy , and I 's seed a heap of trouble . And I 's ready to leave it now . She stops a moment . Softly . You ai n't done nothin ' wrong , has you , Angie ? You 's des mah li'l fellow , ai n't you ? She begins a low crooning song , one she used to sing to her little Tom , ANGIE 'S father . Um  --  um  --  um  --  There is a sound of heavy footsteps outside . ANGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whah you is . You 's safe . Um  --  um  --  um  --  I know it 's him . Stay whah you is . Um  --  um  --  um  --  . The experience meeting is over , and the last hymn is being sung in a mournful minor : " Everybody 's got to go.Everybody 's got to go.First place to the graveyard , Then to the judgment bar.Everybody 's got to go . " THE SHERIFF , a big kindly man , comes in at the left front . He stands looking down at ANGIE . GRANNY keeps on crooning. p. 29 THE SHERIFF To his men outside : ' S all right , fellows , here he is . And keep quiet out there . We do n't want to get mixed in this prayer-meeting . He comes up to ANGIE . Well , Angie , we 've come for you . ANGIE O lord !  --  Granny !  --  THE SHERIFF We 've got to take him , Granny . GRANNY pulls ANGIE 'S arms from around her . GRANNY Go on wid im . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothin ' but love you lak de old times . The music in the parlor stops . THE SHERIFF Leaning out the door:Say , that meeting 's breaking up . Go back of the house , I 'll take him out through the right here . He pulls ANGIE up . Come on , Angie . It 's bad , but you got to go . He takes him out through the entry . ANGIE Granny !  --  They 'll kill me !  --  GRANNY Go on , boy , go on . And I 'll be prayin ' for you lak de old times when I had you heah . But de Lawd done sent ' is sign . She stands up , swaying slightly . The look of lost intelligence comes back into her eyes . Um  --  um  --  um  --  um  --  ILA and LORINA come in and get their cloaks and hats from the wall . They stand watching her a moment. p. 30 ILA Granny , we 's  --  LORINA Let er alone . She 's talkin her unknown tongues as usual . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " WILEY BOY is heard outside , saying to BROTHER DAY : " Sho ' , we can , the moon 's shinin ' lak pure day . " Then they laugh . The automobile horn is sounded . ILA Standing in the door:We 'll be back after while . She goes out . The car is started , and they all go off , laughing and singing : " Everybody 's got to go.First place to the graveyard , Then to the judgment bar.Everybody 's got to go . " GRANNY Gazing into space:And I seed a light a-shinin ' , and it said to me  --  And I seed a cloud a-risin ' , and it said to me  --  Um  --  um  --  um  --  . Her voice dies away . The notes of the whippoorwill come up into the room , and then the chir  --  r-rp , chir  --  r  --  p of a mocking bird . The wind blows in at the door , setting the lamp 's flame dancing and the shadows playing around the old woman with her blown white hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , and borne in on the wind comes the last faint mocking wisp of song : " Everybody 's got to go .
