Thomas Alva Edison , intimate friend of Henry Ford and Harvey Samuel Firestone , spoke last week of another friend : " He was the most remarkable business man I have ever known . . . . " <P> The man Inventor Edison referred to was Charles Albert Coffin , who founded the General Electric Co. ( 1892 ) , who sold new uses for electricity , who in less than half his own lifetime helped considerably to change the character of civilization . Last week , at the age of 81 , he died of pneumonia , after four years of retirement from business . By 1883 , the year Charles Albert Coffin turned from his profitable manufacturing of shoes at Lynn , Mass. , to the manufacturing of electrical equipment , electricity was in little practical use . Samuel Finley Breese Morse ( 1791-1872 ) had shown in 1844 that it could be used for telegraphy . In 1876 Alexander Graham Bell ( 1847-1922 ) applied it to telephony . Charles Francis Brush ( 1849- ) invented the Brush electric arc light in 1878 . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clanking generator and the incandescent lamp , and Elihu Thomson ( 1853- ) his 500 and more industrial applications . <P> Electrician Thomson 's industrial devices appealed to New Englander Coffin . He financed them , created the Thomson-Houston electric companies in this country and abroad . Nevertheless as late as 1892 electricity was little used industrially , although in telegraphy and telephony it had already become a necessity and in lighting an approved innovation . <P> In 1892 Mr. Coffin negotiated the merger of his Thomson-Houston Electric Co. of Lynn , Mass. , with the Edison General Electric Co. of Schenectady , which J. P. Morgan had casually financed to manufacture power machinery . The new General Electric Co. which absorbed them ( and , soon after , several other competitive and related firms ) covered their entire field . Mr. Coffin , perspicacious of the industry 's future , obtained control ; made himself president . He was able to do this because he was in many respects as adroit a financier as Mr. Morgan and because Mr. Morgan never had a flair for young industries . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Mr. Coffin had Edwin Wilbur Rice Jr . ( 1862- ) and Charles Proteus Steinmetz ( 1865-1923 ) as his technicians . ( He could not keep Samuel Insull as sales agent . ) Himself he devoted to inducing industry to use electricity for power . <P> His mediacy had created the comforts and thereby had induced the crowding of huge modern cities . This was essential , he once said , " to attain a high degree of human culture . But all the advantages of the city will soon be possible on the farm without having to put up with city life . . . . Heretofore we have been compelling electricity to take us to the city . Hereafter we shall simply touch a button and have it take the city out to us . " He was the applier of electricity , but , when asked what it was , he said : " I ca n't tell you . I had to ask Mr. Edison , but he did n't know . He said there were only two things in the world and electricity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this unknown something which makes matter move . " <P> General Electric commenced with a $37,000,000 capitalization . Now it has $26,706,675 of 6% special stock and $180,287,046 of common stock outstanding .
