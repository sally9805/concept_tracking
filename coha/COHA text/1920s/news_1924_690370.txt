txt William G. took personal charge last night of the drive that it was hoped would put him in sight of the Democratic nomination for President and actually brought him up to 505% votes . From headquarters in Suite 203 in the , Madison Square Hotel , directly opposite the convention hall , Mr. was in constant communication with his lieutenants and directed the moves which made him the big gainer on the night 's balloting . Among those with Mr. for practically all the time the convention was in session were Bernard M. Baruch and Thomas L. Chadbourne , two of Mr. 's principal backers . Soon after 11 o'clock , just before the convention adjourned , Mr. Baruch left the hotel and returned almost immediately with Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas . Senator Robinson had a private talk with Mr. and it was assumed that the purpose in sending for him was to ask him to withdraw as a candiilate so that the eighteen votes of Arkansas might be thrown to Mr. , placing him within striking distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaders in the drive that was . cut short by an early adjournment and is expected to be continued this morning . Robinson Refuses to Talk . Senator Robinson came down from the suite after a few minutes , and was approached by newspaper reporters in the lobby of the hotel . He declined to tell anything concerning his conversation with Mr. . Mr. and his associates in the Madison Square Hotel headquarters made desperate efforts to get some assurance from the Virginia delegates that Senator Carter Glass would withdraw and permit the 24 votes of Virginia to be thrown to Mr. . Former Governor Claude A. Swanson of Virginia was among those who saw Mr. at his convention headquarters . It could not be learned whether Mr. had received any assurance that Senator Glass would withdraw , but the prevailing opinion was that this was not likely , at least at present . There was a constant stream of leaders going and coming between the convention hall and Mr. 's suite in the Madison Square Hotel . Among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and E. T. Meredith of Iowa , Colonel Thomas B. Love of Texas , and Colonel Samuel B .. Amidon , of Kansas . Mr. also was said to have been in almost constant telephonic communication with Judge David Ladd Rockwell , his campaign manager , and his floor leaders , a telephone having been installed in the room used as headquarters by the field forces In Madison Square Garden . Rockwell Confers With Chief Immediately after adjournment of the convention Judge Rockwell , J. Bruce Kremer of Montana , the chief floor leader , and Bryce Claggett , Mr. 's secretary , joined Mr. at the headquarters in the Madison Square Hotel . Mr. declined to comment upon the gain he had shown in the balloting . " I have nothing to say , " he said with a smile . " It was good , " was Judge Rockwell 's comment . " Everything looks sweet . " Mr. and his party then left for the Hotel Vanderbilt , where there was a general conference of the leaders . Efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an actual majority will be continued this morning . With all night to work upon the delegates and candidates like Senator Glass and Senator Robinson , whose candidacies are now blocking further progress for Mr. , in the opinion of his leading supporters , the leaders have some hope of success . The effort of the strategists will be to get a majority for their candidate and keep ibefor a long time while the convention remains deadlocked . It was said to be their belief that in such a situation enough of the minority delegates would break to Mr. to make a nomination and end the convention . Denies Conference on Deadlock . Judge Rockwell 's assertion that there was no representative in any conference looking to end the deadlock by bringing about the retirement of both Mr. and Governor Smith , to leave the way clear for a nomination , was made in reply to a question in which he was told that there was such a conference , and that two supporters of Mr. were believed to be in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself present , " Judge Rockwell said . " There could n't be , because Mr. is n't going to retire . He is going to be nominated . " We 've got the delegates . I think any observer of political national conventions will agree that they have never before seen forces held together as have the forces . They have had no thought of deserting . " There has been courage and optimism on the side . On the other side there has been selfishness , intrigue , jealousy and constant turmoil . There is no leader on the other side . That 's the truth about ** Judge Rockwell was asked what he thought of William J. Bryan 's speech land said that he had been in the Madison Square Hotel when Mr. Bryan started but had heard the noise of the demonstration and had hurried back to Madison Square Garden . " The reaction to the speech was good , " Judge Rockwell said . " Mr. Bryan is the greatest moral influence in this country . Mr. Bryan 's appeal was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the forces of progressivism and reaction was more closely defined after his speech than before it . He pointed out the duty the Party owed the country and that it could only discharge its duty by nominating a man who is the champion of the cause of the common people . Such a man is Mr. . Bryan Still Beloved , He Says . " There are more progressives than reactionaries by far in this convention . It Seems to me that Mr. Bryan pointed out clearly the course these progressives should pursue . United , as they will be , they will surely nominate Mr. . " " Another thing I want to say is that the delegates ' do the voting , not the galleries . The galleries may jeer Mr. Bryan , but he is still beloved by the majority of the delegates . " " If there should be a movement away from Mr. would he release his delegates ? " Judge Rockwell was asked . " I ca n't conceive of any such situation arising , " Judge Rockwell replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite word is victory . That means we are going to nominate Mr. . " Judge Rockwell was informed that In the opinion of some of the newspaper reporters present he had not answered the question specifically . He replied : " The delegates committed to Mr. would not accept release if it were offered them . But I ca n't conceive of any contingency arising which would bring up the question . " Another question asked Judge Rockwell was whether he was still of the opinion that a majority for Mr. could be produced in the convention any time he wanted it . " I will answer that question by saying that Mr. will receive a majority , " Judge Rockwell replied . In reply to another question he said the forces had no thought of trying to force a majority nomination by an attempt to abrogate the twothirds rule . Judge Rockwell smiled when asked if he had noticed during the day any more " lobbyists or representatives of Wall Street " whom he had charged the preceding day with working on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would say that they were flushed by you boys and driven off the floor , " he replied . " Do you think you have eliminated Mr. Davis as a possibility ? " he was asked . " I would n't say we did it , " he replied , " the delegates did it . I do n't mean this in a disrespectful way , for I have a high regard for the former Ambassador to Great Britain , but the fact that ; he has not gained during a long period of balloting is conclusive proof that his candidacy is not taking . " " Do you think you are going to celebrate Mr. 's nomination on the Fourth of July ? " was the final question . " It would be a great way to celebrate it , " Judge Rockwell said . He then returned to Mr. 's suite for further conference with him before beginning of the night session . HOW Milli Men View Situation . Refusing to concede an inch of ground , lieutenants of Governor Smith declared after last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the nomination of their favorite to and beyond the Fourth of July if necessary . They added that they had not yet begun a real fight . " has passed the 100 mark , " said Franklin D. Roosevelt , leader of the Smith forces in New York , " and he may go still higher , but he will never pass the majority mark . " The Smith men are anxious to battle with their opponents to the , finish . After that they will turn their attention to killing off the next important contender . It will be some time yet before the Smith men set out to show the full strength of their candidate , but when that time comes , they are confident of running him well beyond the greatest strength shown by Mr. . On this attempt they expect Governor Smith to receive considerably more than a majority vote of the convention . " How about tomorrow ? " Governor Smith was asked after the convention had adjourned and he had finished talk " ing with a number of delegates . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the eve of the Fourth of July . " 1 Smith Followers Bitter-Enders . James J. Hoey , Senator James J. Walker and other Smith leaders said they intended to stick to the finish and show the anti-Smith delegates just how far they could go in loyalty to their candidate . Smith leaders denied that any proposition had been received from the camp to go into a conference . The Governor talked with several of his own lieutenants at the Manhattan Club , and then retired to his rooms at the Biltmore Hotel and said that , conference or no conference , nothing would be forth , coming from his side . " If there is to be a big get-together , " said a close friend of the Governor , " it will be while the balloting is going on tomorrow . But no overtures will come from the Smith side , We are bitter enders when it comes to sticking by the Governor . " Franklin D. Roosevelt , - marilger of the Smith campaign , issued this statement from his seat in the convention hall when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ? " The other day I asked all my fellow delegates to bear throughteut " this convention the spirit of the immortal Lincoln , ' with charity toward all , with malice toward none . ' 31akes Plea for'Fair Play . " I want to add to that a plea for the spirit of fair play  --  I stand for a man I who has scorned political trickery , who is honest to his heart 's core  --  eye are not willing to disrupt our party by attacking any one . We ask your votes for our man because he will spend his time fighting Republican corruption not the other leaders in his own party . Such a man is Alfred E. Smith . " The race for the nomination Was described by Roosevelt , when the convention adjourned tonight , in the following statement : " From our standpoint , only the obvious developments have taken place . We have conserved our strength . The forces have extended theirs . They have now had forty-two chances to win and have not come nearer than fortysome votes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary twothirds , and it is doubtful If ever they can obtain a majority . " The Smith men declared they had declined to permit any increase in their total tonight beyond the 320 point . " When Mr. has finished , " Mr. Roosevelt told his assistant floor leaders , " then we will have our run . But the time is not opportune yet for any demonstration of full balloting power . " Break Excites Smith 's Friends , The desertion of two New York delegates to the camp furnished excitement among the friends of Governor " Alfred E. Smith yesterday . The break may have cheered the forces but the Smith men quickly spread the word that the two deserters would be back In the Smith column after they had carried out their promises to give the Californian a few votes . The two delegates were Lathrop Brown of St. James , L. I. , and Roscoe Irwin of Kingston . Their defection was somewhat discounted by every one in the Smith camp for it had been known for several " days that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few ballots . In point of fact only one of the two , Brown , has decided leanings . He was for fbur years ago and was the centre of disturbance during the rally at the San Francisco convention . Smith delegates said they recalled that he was roughly handled when he attempted to sieze the New York atandard and parade with the delegates . Brown , a former representative , lives in Suffolk County , where the Ku Klux Klan has considerable influence . He would not discuss reports about his attitude toward the Klan . Brown Talks to Governor . Brown , talking to a member of the New York delegation said he had promised to vote for Mr. a few times and would like to keep , his word . Smith , he said , was getting nowhere . He was advises to see Franklin D. Roosevelt , or the Governor and he called upon Mr. Smith at the Manhattan Club . After he had told the Governor what was on his mind , the Governor said : " I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to do so . You have my permission , if you need it , to vote for whom you please . " The result was that Brown transferred his vote to but explained he intended to return to the Smith camp . Some New York delegates told him it ' did n't matter whether he ? returned or not . They thought they could get along without him . The situation in regard to Roscoe Erwin is somewhat different and there is little resentment among the New York crowd because of his action in giving a vote or two . Erwin , Mayor of Kingston twice , held for eight years , under Mr. , then Secretary of the Treasury , the post of Collector of Internal Revenue of the district which takes in the Hudson Valley , with headquarters at Albany . He owed his appointment entirely to and when the latter sent word that he wanted some votes from the New York delegation , Irwin responded . He made it plain , however , that his defection from Smith , with whom he la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works on Delegates . The secession of Irwin and Brown marks the full extent of the effort to pry Smith delegates loose in New York . For many days Stewart Giboney , Mr. 's former law partner , has been industriously working in the New York group to pick up a vote or two . He was furnished with a list containing sixteen names of men said to be friendly to the California candidate . The list fell into the hands of the Smith men , and a careful checking up of the list showed that only three men , two delegates , Brown and Irwin , and one alternate whose name was not divulged , were- at all likely to give ant aid to Mr. . Satisfied that the full extent of the defectione " had been reached , . the Smith managers paid little attention to threats of trouble made by men . They reserved all their strength for the big drive against the Californian at the proper time . The- Smith managers said they would not exert their full stfiength for their candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent , they said , that could , go no further , they would begin , theeSmith drive which they fondly expected to send their candidate over the top . There was mysterious talk among the Smith men all day as to viten the break for Smith would occur . It seemerto be the general opinion that Thursday night , on the eve of the:Fourth of July , would be the best time lo start the - Smith movement . If this drive should fail , the Smith forces are all prepared to start another movement for the Governor . Smith Talked of for Second Place . This second Smith offensive will consist of booming the Governor for second place on an acceptable ticket . Under no circumstances , the Governor has let it be known , will lie take second place on a Presidential ticket with Senator Ralston of Indiana . Thomas Taggert , Democratic boss of Indiana , tried out the suggestion , but he met a decided rebuff . , In fact , one reason for the present aloofness between Taggert and the Tammany leaders is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as a candidate for second place with the Indiana Senator . When the suggestion was first made to Governor Smith that he would be acceptable to Ralston as a running mate the Governor sent back a reply that is said to have set Taggert 's ears - ringing , and at the same time the Governor gave out a statement to the effect he would not consider second place under any conditions . Since that time there has been no discussion of the Vice Presidency within the Governor 's hearing . But the Smith board of strategy has not given up the idea . They foresee a Possibility that the Governor and Mr. will become so thoroughly deadlocked that it will be utterly absurd to think that either candidate can win and a recourse to a dark horse will be necessary . When that time comes the Smith strategists hope to be able to suggest a compromise that may not be entirely unsatisfactory to the Governor . Whether that compromise will be a ticket made up of Underwood and Smith , or a Western candidate and Smith , is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLLECT . ' Delegates Protest Against Telegrams Appealing for Candidates . Many of the candidate managers were working the " telegram from home " game on the delegates yesterday . The disappointing feature of the outcome was that a lot of telegrams came collect . The dictates of the finest traditions of a hundred years of Democratic historY , in the view of 0 . Max Gardner , Chairman of the North Carolina delegation , are that high-strung home folks who send telegrams to their representatives in the National Convention should pay the charges . Of some 300 telegrams from all sections of the State reaching North Carolina 's Chairman this morning many came collect . " Without expressing approval of the telegraphic referendum on the Presidential nomination , " Mr. Gardner said , " let us go on record as unalt9rably in ' , favor of tin ? principle of prepayment .

The statement condemned Governor Smith as one who violated the very Constitution he had sworn to defend by favoring the light wine and beer law . A TEA AT JACKSON HEIGHTS . Two Hundred Convention Visitors ' From South Are Guests . Two hundred convention visitors from the South , including delegates and alternates , were guests at a musicale and tea given by the Ladies ' Jackson Heights Southern Society at the Jackson Heights Country Club yesterday . The guests were taken in automobiles from the Hotel Commodore and were met at Jackson Heights by a committee consisting of Mrs. E. E. Childs , Chairman ; Mrs. M. C. Dorwin , Mrs. J. P. Edwards , Mrs. W. H. Blandford , 1 Mrs. A. L. Kenyon , Mrs. C. J. Morrow , Mrs. F. J.
