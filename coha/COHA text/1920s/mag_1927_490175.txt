ASAD little newspaper story happened to take our gaze the other morning . It related that a youth , coming into a fortune of nine million dollars , went to work as a **25;223;TOOLONG clerk in the Illinois National Bank . This was calculated to arouse in the reader a feeling of admiration . In us it aroused pity and disappointment ; for in what other country would a youth have so little imagination , so little courage , so little Byronic fire as to celebrate his financial independence by clerking in a bank , of all pursuits the stuffiest and most hollow ? Shame ! Any youth today with enough money to buy so much as a horse should plant a cactus bush in the front yard of his bank , do cn his spurs , and ride off to woo Princess Deana , who lives in a kingdom called Roumania . ACCESSION to the throne of so- ciety often comes  --  as we intimated last week  --  through such a simpie expedient as buying a horse for one 's child . Continued possession of the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures one buys . Art is holy , in the places of the most high ; and we are painfully aware that a vast deal of art is being bought by persons less concerned with beautifying than with fortifying their walls . All this is so easy . In an age when substantiality and respectability come dear , buying a picture is the most substantially respectable thing any man can do . It has come to be much , much more respectable than owning a string of race horses  --  and it is cleaner . A LIVE woman 's head , to which was attached no body , waggled in front of the Hippodrome the other day , and we stood with the crowd for several minutes , adding our admiring gaze . It was just the old decapitation stunt , but we never tire of its charm . To our chagrin , the barker was an-nouncing that this was an optical illusion , performed with the aid of several highly polished mirrors . This disappointed us more than you can imagine . We had waited hopefully to be told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret of this marvel , ladies and gentlemen  --  with a single stroke of the sword he severs body from head , leaving the lady alive and unimpaired . " We would n't have believed a word of it , but we ached to hear it , standing there in Sixth Avenue . In a world of entirely believable mirrors , we found ourself craving to hear , for a single shining moment , that headless women exist , that crazy things sometimes happen . Eager we were to be made drunk on poppycock . JOHN GRATKE , of the Broadway Association , says that although he would like to keep the Metropolitan on Broadway , he believes that the Location Committee for the new opera house should take into consideration the traffic situation and select the site that would relieve traffic most . Well , the site that would relieve traffic most is just north of Briarcliff , out the Saw Mill River Road . Our own opinion about locating the new opera house , however , is that there should be a reversion downtown . What about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure opera tradition ? It would not be necessary to remove the fish : they could be incorporated into the scheme of interior decoration . Traffic would he relieved because opera-goers would be compelled to sail down the river in ships . Also it would be a nice gesture to the memory of Jenny Lind . NOTHING is more vividly entertaining to us than travel ads . Pictures of rickshaws , pyramids , mountains , camels , and the tall proud sides of ocean liners easily dispel the tedium of a long Sunday afternoon at home . The names of distant ports carry us on journeys of romance and discovery , and we are as a babe in the hands of copywriters . The Sunday Times ' directory of travel lies before us even now , and , promising ourself a trip sometime , we pore over the enchanted names  --  Peru , Iguazu Falls , Africa , 18 NOVENIDER 12 , 19 27 A Perfect Stranger IT is well known that a gentleman who would not think of crossing the lobby of a hotel to offer a drink to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated across the aisle in a Pullman club car . This curious feeling of good fellowship came upon a business man of this city on a westbound train recently . In flagrant violation of national , interstate and probably other laws , he had openly produced a silver flask and compounded drinks , soon reaching the hearty state in which he believed the occupant of the next seat would like to hear the story of his life and triumphs . The latter , although declining highballs , listened gravely . Finally the loquacious traveller was heard to remark , " Well , it 's been a long trip . Probably ? heh , heh  --  longer than a young man like you has often taken . Now myself . .. " It was at this moment that the porter entered and , addressing the listener , said , " Prett ' near Detroit ; can All brush you up , Commander Byrd ? " The widely travelled person was profoundly silent for the first time that day . Way of Living THE debutantes littered the place up pretty thoroughly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day when we saw it . Somehow it has escaped glitter , despite all the precious metals which have gone into its making . In architecture it is Italian . In spirit it is French . In price it is American . Right beneath the golden spire , which pricks the sky deeply , is an airy duplex for thirty-five thousand dollars a year . The man who showed usthrough it said it would be ideal for an artist , but added sorrowfully that he did n't know any artist with that much money . Life in this hotel , whose doorknobs have become proverbial because they are gold - plated , whose bathroom fixtures are silver , and whose very pots and pans down in the kitchen are solid nickel , will be softened , we were assured , by the Sherry idea of service . This idea , as far as we could gather , is that everybody is eccentric and possibly slightly cracked , and therefore anything they do is right . Walking through , we had the feeling that if we were to evince a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at our side to help us balance . The rooms and corridors and shafts are so arranged that a rare fowl or an entire roast can make a quick ascent to private warming ovens . The kitchen looked as efficient as a factory , with its telephone switchboard and ponderous devices . There are no private dining-rooms . In place of them , large furnished apartments are at the disposal of guests who wish to entertain more friends than can be accommodated in their own suite . There is a gentle advantage to this : the hostess need not mention , during the course of the evening , that she is n't in her own room , unless she feels like it . The foyer of the hotel is a copy of the library of the Vatican . One walks straight through down a marble staircase into the formal dining-room where Beauvais tapestries adorn the walls and where a couple of structural girders that run all the way to the tower are so cleverly incorporated into the dignified setting that you hardly know they are there . The grill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with twelve panels in colored tile , depicting the fables of La Fontaine . In the midst of so much beauty we had difficulty marshalling a handful of useful facts : annual rentals average about four thousand dollars a room , maid service included ; Rene is the maitre cl'hatel , the tower is thefourth highest in town ; the stone reliefs in the entrance are from the Vanderbilt mansion ; the doorman is a Russian colonel , and the park in front is Central Park . Light Pastime THE newest indoor game we have come upon is played with cigarette lighters . You merely bet your opponent that your lighter will work more often than his . The rules allow only one turn of the thumb  --  or one push of the button , if it 's that kind of a lighter . If you make a light and your opponent fails , you cry " Flame ! " and collect the stakes . An enthusiast tells us that he won over a hundred dollars in one rainy afternoon session at the Century Club , where the standard wager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of was made by two gentlemen with excellent lighters who snapped for twenty minutes before one of them failed . Our Cavalry , Right or Wrong ABOUT the time this is read Major General Summerall and his associates will be smiling as broadly as military men permit themselves to smile , or they will be doing just the opposite . It will depend on the outcome of the competition in which the Army jumping team is engaged at the Horse Show . The thing has had the whole Army , more or less , on edge all week . It will be remembered that last year the Army jumpers finished in seventh place and there was n't any eighth . A little country named  --  let 's see  --  Poland , won , followed by Spain , Italy , France and others . There was consternation in general staff headquarters in Washington and all down the line . Pershing was among the old-time cavalry officers who made hot remarks . Immediately thereafter , although practically nothing was said about it , a nationwide call of boots and saddles was sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best riders to Fort Riley , Kansas , for special observation and training at the cavalry school there . Mounts were gathered from all over . All year there has been intensive training . The American Army team which has been doing the jumping in Madison Square Garden this year is made up of the best in the service and , during the early part of the week , a feeling of confidence was noticeable among the watchful officers present . Albeit there was also nervousness . Consider the importance of the event ! Could the old Locarno courtesy be maintained if six nations should out-jump the Americans two years in suc cession ? At best , however , the visitors will be permitted to indulge themselves in the last polite smile . The American team , as finally selected , comprised three officers trained at the French cavalry school at Saumur and one trained at the Italian cavalry school in Rome . Balm in Gilead MHE story comes to us of a young 1 man who took his young lady to the movies , selecting , unfortunately as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pola Negri 's child is heartrendingly torn from her by her estranged husband 's crooked lawyers . The young lady , who had been seen to shudder several times , finally exclaimed , " Oh , it 's too terrible ! I ca n't stand it any longer . Come on , let 's go over and watch ' em making cigarettes in the windows . " Cockroach I was night . Half-way along the 1 carpet leading to the revolving doors of the Ritz walked a cockroach . At the same moment we saw him , the doorman also saw him . It seemed as though a hush fell upon the town : a good deal was at stake . The doorman , loyal to his rt trust but too proud to bend , tl scuffed . This threw the cockroach off his course , but he spun on his keel , waved his antennae , and started back . For some reason he wanted to get into the Ritz . It would be warmer inside , possibly . On the doorman 's face was a faint look of strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again the doorman struck with his toe ; again the foe counter-attacked . By this time we were trembling from head to foot ; and on the third attempt we closed our eyes . When next we opened them , the doorman was peering straight ahead , in the manner of doormen , and the roach was trotting off amiably in the direction of the Biltmore. * The Perfect Fool W we were introduced to Ed V V Wynn in the Apollo Theatre lobby the other day he did n't try to be funny ; he somewhat firmly avoided it . We found him seriously interested in the technique of his wheezes and gags ( he called them " jokes " himself ) and he analyzed some of his lines for us like a professor lecturing on chemistry . He is not as tall as he seems on the stage , has an eager , credulous expression , and his gestures , facial contortions and voice turn out to be affected exaggerations , although he does have a slight lisp . From Mr. Wynn himself , and from his associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived from If.i.1-1-art.:4401/7 his middle name : he was born Israel Edwin Leopold , in Philadelphia , forty-one years ago last Tuesday . His first job was amusing patrons of his father 's hat shop by putting on hats too large or too small for him , a stunt he has always used . Next , as an amateur , he cut up for visitors at Atlantic City , where his family habitually spent the sutnmer . Their laughter encouraged him and when he was fifteen he ran away with a vaudeville show . His schooling ended there . His first part on Broadway was in " The Deacon and the Lady " in 1908 and his first hit was in the " Follies " of 1914 . The year after he was first starred he won the enmity of the theatrical managers by his work on behalf of Equity in the actors ' strike . He got a scroll of honor signed by two thousand and twenty actors and actresses but he could n't get another job because Equity did n't control musical comedy . After thinking this over he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ed Virynn 's Carnival " ? hook , lyrics , and music by the producer . This was a success , and later he wrote two others and out of one , " The Perfect Fool , " made half a million . It was a success all over the country . He has written two hundred songs and he plays every stringed instrument . His appearance in " Manhattan Mary " is his first here since 1924 . Mr. Wynn explains his fun-making technique as the use of common expressions in an unusual or distorted sense . He overheard someone say , " Is he a tall , slim man ? " and decided it would be funny to change it to " Are you a tall , slim man ? " and address it to someone who accosts him claiming acquaintanceship . It is one of the most successful lines in his present show . We were interested in the origin of his famous joke of a few seasons ago wherein , as a marine painter , he tells a drunk he can not teach him to paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being taught to paint ancestors anyway , says Wynn : " All right , I 'll teach you to paint ancestors , but they 'll look like ships . " He got the idea , let it he known , from is similar joke in a fifteenth-century German hook . WYNN has a notable library of humorous books . He reads it not for entertainment , however , but with the seriousness of a student . His life has been routine . He has never been to a night club ; he arises at nine o'clock every morning , He had not been to a show himself for more than six years until he went to one in London last summer . This to prevent being unconsciously influenced by other actors ' work . His hobby is golf , which he plays badly but uproariously . He sold three million dollars ' worth of Liberty Bonds during the war and once he turned the entire proceeds of a performance over to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine . The comedian 's wife has been seriously ill for two years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to divert his mind from his worries that he appears faithfully in the theatre lobby half an hour before each performance to greet friends and strangers . He has frequently expressed the longing to be mourned as the Nation 's Jester and he openly envies the esteem in which Fred Stone is held . He wishes that an article about him by J. Brooks Atkinson in a recent Sunday Times could be reprinted as his only eulogy when he dies . Cocktail Book ROWSING through Fitzgerald 's in Vesey Street , where one discovers reprints of ancient pamphlets on parlor magic , dialogues , and the like , we came upon " The Bar-Tender 's Guide , or How to Mix Drinks , " by Jerry Thomas , first published in 1862 . Thinking to call the proprietor 's attention to an item of his stock that perhaps he himself had almost forgotten , we were told that this little book is selling far better now than before prohibition . Calls for it are frequent . It has , in fact , been reprinted in its two styles , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seventy-five cents respectively . It may also he had at the Public Library , where , we hear , the copies are dog's-eared from use . We take its popularity merely as a sign of interest in old books , for the drinks it describes are all intoxicating , and , of course , against the law . ? TRAGEDY of life in the big city : Sign seen in an East Side grocer 's window , " Lost , one of a pair of love birds which escaped from its cage . Will the finder please bring it back as soon as possible , as the other bird is pining for it , and will die unless it is brought back ? " Gargantuan SOMETHING like the clamor of a gypsy camp struck our ears the other day when we turned off Green-wich Street into Cortlandt . Amaz-ingly , radio has taken over this entire block , down to West Street , and the store signs , always white letters shrieking against a background of red ( perhaps so they will be seen above the noise ) , infect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hundred shops , by casual count , make up the encampment . Bedlam reigns particularly , however , in Cortlandt Street where , in half a block , a dozen loudspeakers operate all day long . One , hung far out over the sidewalk on a flagpole , challenges another across the narrow street , with a determined chant on how to raise children . The words become but muffled mouthings when its opponent roars out , sardonically , a popular song , " Baby Feet Go Pitter Patter . " Occasionally , when half a dozen radios are tuned in on the same program , the passerby is dwarfed more by the mountain of sound than by the giant buildings towering over him to the east . Each area-way discloses a loudspeaker , of the console type set before the door , or hung like a shield from the walls . " An early-morning entertainment and service program " was being broadcast as we passed along . Something was bellowed about what you can buy at all stores belonging to the Retail Druggists ' Association . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjacent console , boomed " Broken Hearted " into the warfare of air waves . Hundreds of signs and placards and window di , 5- plays litter the buildings , advertising dry cells and trickle chargers and clarostats and drum dials and transformers . The sidewalks and the stores are as crowded as if they were all sideshows . The shops are never empty of buyers . One proprietor told us he does hundreds of dollars ' worth of business every noon hour . The crowds , ninety per cent men , loiter as if radio were still in the first nine days of its wonder . They are a curious mixture , young men with the light of mechanico-mania in their eyes , grizzled unemployed who find this a diverting place to loaf . Some of them stand and listen , dully , for hours . We saw a man place a hundred copies of the latest radio section of a newspaper on a console top . They were gone in five minutes . It is strange and new and irritating , wandering into this land of giant sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escaping , on a toy train , from among the caves of the Cyclops.
