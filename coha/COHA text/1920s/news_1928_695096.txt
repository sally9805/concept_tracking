txt Fourteen United States Customs guards , detailed to duty on the North River piers , were suspended last night . High officials in the service admitted that the suspension was the forerunner of a sweeping investigation into conditions at the piers where the transatlantic liners dock .

It was said last night that twentytwo more guards would probably be placed on the suspended list within forty-eight hours . Special investigators of the Treasury Department , of which the Custom Service is a branch , have been stationed on the piers for several weeks keeping the suspected men under surveillance .
