Last week interesting facts came to light about the relations between British and German flyers during the War . Captain Thomas J. C. Martyn , British ace , shrewd observer of men and events , former squadron commander at Isle-les-Hameau , and onetime Foreign Editor of TIME , the weekly newsmagazine , was asked to give his opinion on recent despatches from Berlin which stated that Count Manfred von Richthofen , celebrated German flyer , was not shot in the air but killed by caitiff riflemen after he had made a safe landing behind the British lines . <P> " It is a falsehood , " bristled Captain Martyn , " a damnable falsehood ! <P> " I did not see the crash myself but several of the pilots of No. 18 Squadron , on the same aerodrome , saw Richthofen come down and the report was that a Lieutenant Brown had brought him down , though at the same time machine gunners on the ground claimed that they had put his machine out of action . . . . " One thing is certain ; his machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sure that von Richthofen was dead before he crashed . . . . <P> " Von Richthofen was very well thought of by the British aviators as a clean fighter and a man who did not know what fear was . <P> " The only time I ever saw him , was over in Ypres in 1917 . He was fighting four British machines at the time in a welter of anti-air- craft fire . ... I never had an encounter with him , but he killed a friend of mine named Captain Robertson in the summer of 1917 . <P> " As an example of Richthofen 's fine sportsmanship , Major Patrick told me that he once had a fight with Richthofen and that his ammunition ran out . Richthofen , being in a faster machine , had Patrick at his mercy , but when he knew that Patrick was unable to fire he flew close to him , waved his hand and turned back to his own lines . <P> " The report from Berlin that Canadian troops killed Richthofen after he had landed in an irresponsible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall his funeral only from having done the squadron commander 's work while Major Baker was attending the full military funeral we gave von Richthofen . His body was put in a casket on a gun carriage and taken to a cemetery . Most of the air force unit sent wreaths , and he was buried in proper Christian fashion . . . . " <P> Captain Martyn termed the relations of the German and British airmen throughout the War as one of " friendly hostility . " <P> " In 1915 , " he said , " Lieutenant Winthorpe was forced to land on a German flying field . He was taken prisoner , but there was delay in sending him to a prison camp . The Germans immediately dropped a note on Winthorpe 's squadron saying he was safe . The German officers supplied him with clothing , played tennis with him , went hunting with him , and he had a wonderful time for a fortnight . Finally , when the time came for him to go , all the officers petitioned the squadron commander to permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher command , which refused the request . So Winthorpe was removed to a prison camp , from which he later escaped .
