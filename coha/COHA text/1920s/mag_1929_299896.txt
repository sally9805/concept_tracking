After weeks of serious illness . His Majesty George V left Bognor-on-Sea last week to go home . <P> Without ceremony , three automobiles drew up before Sir Arthur ( Dunlop tires ) Du Cros 's comfortable stucco Craigwell House . Standing by the door were butlers , footmen , cooks , grooms , gardeners , royal marines-all who had served and guarded the King during his illness . Through the door came Their Majesties , snugly buttoned up , and as they passed down the line each servant received either a gold stickpin or a pair of gold cufflinks , blue enameled with the royal monogram . Into the car behind the King 's stepped Sir Stanley Hewett , His Majesty 's physician , and four trained nurses entered another automobile . The three cars moved off . <P> Great was the celebration in Windsor when the royal motorcade drove through High Street . Pinafored schoolchildren waved flags and screamed excitedly . The merry housewives of Windsor showered rose petals on King George 's sober limousine . At the foot of Queen Victoria 's statue stood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck his head through the limousine door . <P> " I am happy to be back and to see so many familiar faces again , " he called . The cars moved on up the hill to the plump Norman tower of Windsor Castle . <P> Inside the castle gate stood 1,000 of the King 's young neighbors in battered silk hats and very clean collars , the boys of Eton College . <P> London society was feverishly trying to guess last week who the author of King George 's latest biography might be . The book , " By a Person in Close Touch with the Royal Family , " was begun at the height of the King 's illness in the ghoulish expectation of being the first posthumous biography . With the King 's recovery , proof sheets of the volume were forwarded to Buckingham Palace for approval last week . Officials , horrified at the revelation of personal details in the King 's private life , not only forbade its publication but sent special King 's messengers to the publishers to suppress it . <P> " Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official secretary , " the book is so intimate that his identity could easily be detected . " With only this for a clue , editors busily listed all the King 's personal friends who might have written such a book ; thoughtfully checked and rechecked the list . <P> Many pencils poised questioningly over the name of Hon. Sir John William Fortescue , librarian at Windsor Castle from 1905 to 1926 , author of a life of Wellington , editor of the correspondence of George III . The pencils poised also over the name of Sir John 's brother , Capt . Hon. Sir Seymour Fortescue , equerry-in-waiting to King George since 1893 , author of a book of memoirs , Looking Back . <P> Instantly cleared of suspicion was the King 's private secretary , Baron Stamford-ham , courtly letter-writer and precise putterer , characterized by Queen Victoria as " a model of tact and diplomacy .
