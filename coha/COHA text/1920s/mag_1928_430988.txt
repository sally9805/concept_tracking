 |p481  ALL my wishes end where I hope my days will end , at Monticello , " wrote 1 1 Thomas Jefferson to a friend . This great practical politician was at heart a bit of a sentimentalist . He had two great romances in his life : One was his one and only wife , the beautiful young Martha Wayles Skelton ; the other was his " Little Mountain , " the estate and the noble house he called Monticello . Driving across Tidewater Virginia to the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains , and approaching the little city of Charlottesville , the traveler 's attention is at once arrested by two related historic points . At the right a gatepost sign signals the entrance to Shadwell , where Jefferson was horn in 1743 ; and , standing just here at Shadwell 's gate , looking across a sweeping gap , through which the Rivanna races down from the mountains to join the James , one picks out an angle of a high white portico in the green forests on the nearer summit of a mountain group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration of Independence had the fulfillment of the best " wishes " of his long life , and his days did " end " there , for it is Monticello . The Little Mountain crept into the consciousness of young Jefferson when he was a mere lad at Shadwell . It belonged to his father . HIS BY TIE CONQUEST OP YOUTHFUL IMAGINATION While the Little Mountain was still his father 's , and so only " ours " and not yet " mine , " he nevertheless made it his own ley the imaginative conquest of boyhood 's playtime and dreams . During the lad 's impressionistic years it held for him the chief mysteries of life . He found it peopled with the elves and ogres which inhabit every child 's own world . Actually it was alive with the wild life which engages every normal boy 's curiosity . It was his constant playground , the gymnasium of his knitting muscles , and at its crest the far-flung panorama of a beauty which was to him unequaled and unimagined anywhere else in the world gave him his boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's death brought him a step nearer to the ownership and possession of his Little Mountain . During the next seven years in college and studying law at Williamsburg , the maturity of any dreams waited upon his coming of age , in 1764 . Thereafter his notebook began to bristle with the preparations going forward on his mountain top . A cellar was begun in the winter of 1767-8 . A well was dug , and he wrote that " they dug and drew out 8 cubical yds. in a day . " On Christmas Eve " the sawyers left off work , " and they had " sawed 2,500 pales , 220 rails , 65o f. of inch chestnut plank &; 250 of 24-inch do . " So were cut and left to season the planks which were to go into his house . THIS SMALL HOUSE BECOMES HONEYMOON COTTAGE The following July the brick-making had begun , and by that time he had enjoyed the thrill of seeing " Mr. Moore and his men " begin the leveling of the summit of the plateau of 120,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the first building rose within a twelvemonth . That building was a small , one-story brick house , which we see there to-day , southeast of the great mansion , which , however , was not completed until some 30 years later . Shadwell burned down in 1770 ? young Jefferson was 27 ? and he thereupon moved up to the new little house on his mountain , and here kept bachelor 's hall when not absent " practicing on the circuit , " or " sitting " in the House of Burgesses , or looking for a mate and mistress for his home .  |p482  Two years later it became his Honeymoon Cottage . On January I , 1772 , he and Martha Wayles Skelton were married " down in tidewater . " Immediately they began their long drive to their mountain home . Eight miles from it , at old Blenheim , they ran into a blizzard . The wheeled chaise could not be dragged farther through the snow . Nothing daunted , the romantic young people left it behind , mounted their horses , rode on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . The servants had no thought that the newlyweds could make their way through the storm , and so they had all gone to bed . But the young couple needed no welcome to stimulate their happiness . There are questionable traditions of how on arrival they diverted themselves with fiddle , books , a bottle of wine , and by cooking their supper . The biographer , James Parton , however , gives an enthusiastic account , probably nearer the truth : " They burst into the house and flooded it with the warmth and light of their own unquenchable good humor ! Who could wish a better place for a honeymoon than a snug brick cottage , lifted five hundred and eighty feet above the world . . . and three feet of snow blocking out all intruders ? " WRITES THE DECI , ARATION OP INDEPENDENCE ON DESK HE INVENTED During the next decade Jefferson was often absent from his home . First he made long trips to Philadelphia , where he sat in the sessions of the Second Continental Congress and wrote the Declaration of Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a replica of which we see at Monticello , the original now being preserved in the National Museum at Washington . Later he was detained for considerable periods in Richmond as Governor of the State . At the end of a decade of married life , Mrs. Jefferson died . She had borne him five children , of whom two daughters only  |p483  reached maturity . Meantime work on the big house had gone forward , but it did not then look at all as it did when finished . Yet , fortunately , there is a good description of it as it was then , for in that year , 1782 , the French general , Marquis de Chastellux , in the course of a tour of America , visited Monticello , and this is his account of what he saw : " The house , of which Mr. Jefferson was the architect , and of ten one of the workmen , is rather elegant , and in the Italian taste , though not without fault ; it consists of one rather large pavilion , the entrance of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ground floor consists of a very large , lofty saloon , which is to be decorated entirely in the antique style ; above it is a library of the same form ; two small wings , with only a ground floor and attic story , are joined to this pavilion , and communicate with the kitchen , offices , etc. , which form a kind of basement story , over which runs a terrace . " My object in this short description is only to show the difference between this and the other houses of the country ; for we may safely aver that Mr. Jefferson is the first American who has consulted the fine arts to know how he should shelter himself from the weather . " OWNER BORROWS FROM THE FRENCH SOME IDEAS FOR A HOME Jefferson 's longest absence from Monticello was during the five years when he was abroad as the young Republic 's Minister to France . But even after that he was at home on little more than vacations , during the succeeding years , when he was Secretary of State , Vice-President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ideas which modified the original plans for the house he seemed to have got by his observation of French houses . It was his expanding career which led him to double the depth of his house . He fell in love with the dome on the Hotel de  |p484  Salm , in Paris , and it inspired him to add a dome to Monticello ; but for it he eventually adopted the Temple of Vesta , out of the plates of his beloved Palladio ( see , also , text , page 485 ) . The mansion as we see it to-day was completed during his first term as President , and when he finally left public life , in 1809 , he came to spend the rest of his life in the house now so familiar . Remembering these things as we drive on past Shadwell , always under and in sight of Monticello , any speed seems unequal to our eagerness to climb to the historic eyrie on the crest . The way leads across the river at the edge of Charlottesville , over a delightful road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to serpentine the mountain as it climbs . The horizons of the lovely panorama fall farther and farther away as we mount , when suddenly the car plunges into a dark forest of woody giants , everyone of which looks as if it had been a friend an old friend , doubtless a boyhood friend ? of Jefferson . Suddenly , in an opening among the trees , as if at the hottom of a well of golden sunlight , the great gates and gatehouse appear and mark the limit of the modern estate . Jefferson 's land holding on and about his Little Mountain contained 5.200 acres . Toclay the land attached to the historic house on the mountain top . belonging to and cared for by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation , amounts to 683 acres . Inside the gates there is an even stiffer climb , up the last half mile . before the forest gives way to a clearing in which is revealed Monticello mansion in all its familiar and beautiful aspects . Really to appreciate how imaginative Jefferson was in conceiving his house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before entering , make the circuit of the whole domestic unit . It is not , as it appears , merely a dwelling house . It is a group of housings for servants and workmen ? for shops , offices , and other necessities ? yet so adroitly disposed thay  |p485  one is not at any one time conscious of more than the central mansion and the two detached houses , connected by the low terraces . HIS HOUSE PLAN COPIED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Actually the splendid dwelling is in the center of one side of an open rectangle , the balance of which side , together with the two sides projecting at right angles to it , is submerged below the level of the lawn . These lateral extensions rise at their extremities in the two small brick houses , the one on the north being known as Ir . Jefferson 's Law Office , and the other , facing it , as Honeymoon Cottage . The connecting terraces are in fact the flat roofs of the extensive domestic quarters , wholly open to light and air on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson used also in planning the University of Virginia , he borrowed from the great Italian architect . Andrea Palladio , to whom he was indebted for the first plan of his mansion . Being an artist and imaginative , Jefferson loved to create these illusions , and in yet another way he made his house look smaller than it actually is . He must have chuckled as he found people falling into his trap of having them believe that it is a one-story house , whereas in fact it has four stories . The lowest floor is a basement , on the same level with all the terraced domestic quarters . The main story is lofty , and through the center of the house it rises into what is elsewhere , under the same roof , the third story . The top , or fourth , story is artfully concealed by the pediments of the two porticoes and by the balustrade , which edges the roof line ( see Color Plate XVII ) . When we come to enter we discover that there is no back to Monticello . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , two fronts , as was the case with nearly all major plantation houses . These were the approach front , to which callers and guests came , and the opposite , or private , front ,  |p486  where , especially when screened by a portico , the family gathered . Entering Monticello then , as the public enters to-day , by the approach front , one passes trader the lofty ceilings of the two central saloons , to the left into Jefferson 's bedroom and study and library and into the bedroom of his ( laughter Martha . On the opposite end of the house one finds the dining room , the breakfast room , and two other bedrooms , which he named the Madison and Monroe rooms , after his two neighbors who so frequently occupied them . in the two stories above are other bedrooms , reached by two stairways which are most comfortably ascended by those who have the slender proportions of a match , for certainly they are the narrowest stairways which ever were put into a gentleman 's house . If Jefferson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect , ever explained his reason for these stairways , that explanation has so far refused to come forward and it is still a mystery ( page 485 ) . MANY OF JEFFERSON 'S INVENTIONS ARE INCORPORATED IN HIS HOUSE Every step about Monticello is a revelation of that celebrated man who built it and lived in it . A dozen objects and devices there tell us that Jefferson was not only an able architect , but that he was an inventor as well , and that his home was his playhouse . He himself said that politics was his business , but science was his delight . In his floors he used the curious expedient of planks with double grooves , and held them together by inserting detached " tongues . " In the ends of his diningroom mantel , ingeniously concealed in the paneling , are set two tiny dumb-waiters , by which the wine and liquor bottles traveled to and from the cellar . In perfect working order to-day , we find his own installation of a concealed  |p487  mechanism for double glass doors , which move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been suggested that these may have been the forerunners of our present-day trolley-car doors , which are operated by a similar device ( see p. 499 ) . Jefferson had not a single bedstead in his house . In showing a guest to his bedroom he must have enjoyed the expression of surprise at finding a chamber without any bed . But Jefferson had not ignored such an insistent natural function as sleep . He would part a hanging and disclose the bed , set in an alcove just the dimensions of the mattress ; but that comfortable article knew no bedstead ; it lay on a mesh of rope laced on hooks sunk into the walls . We find Jefferson 's own bed , in an alcove in the wall between his bedroom and his study , rather better off for ventilation , as it is open on two sides ; and more convenient , too , for as the spirit moved him he could get up immediately on one side into his bedroom or on the other side into his study . It is said that he installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its alcove , so that during the day he enjoyed a broad passageway between the two rooms adjacent to it . In the east wall of the house , under the portico , is a large clock , with a double face , ingeniously placed so that he could see one face while he was out of doors and the other when he was indoors . Near the latter is a " fox-and-geese " ladder to reach the mechanism . This is one of Jefferson 's most ingenious devices , for the rungs are all hinged , the uprights are grooved , and the whole thing folds up into the appearance of a single , solid , slender piece of mahogany ( see page 484 ) . Above the same portico is a weather vane , but its mechanism extends down to the out-of-door ceiling , where he installed a dial and indicator , so that he could inform himself of the direction of the wind without leaving the protection of his own roof ( see Color Plate XVIII ) . THE OWNER OF MONTICELLO LOVED A GADGET Jefferson designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolving top , so that sitting by it he could , without  |p488  rising , bring to his hand objects on the opposite side of it ? a sort of first cousin to " Lazy Susan . " Another of his tables had hollow legs , in which were rods supporting the writing surface ; but these rods were so hinged to the top that he could not only raise and secure the top at a height which made it convenient for him to write or read or draw at it when standing up or sitting down , but he could also tilt the top at any angle he found convenient . Obviously he belonged to that large brotherhood which loves a gadget . Quick to appreciate ingenious novelties , he picked them up wherever he found them , and not only brought them home , but he improved them . One such contrivance was an attachment which he found in Milan , for the hub of his carriage wheel to tell the nummer of revolutions made obviously the granddaddy of the modern speedometer . Another was a polygraph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one writing ( see Color Plate XXIV ) . Jefferson improved on this , so that his polygraph made four copies . JEFFERSON THE FARMER As a planter he showed the same originality and love of the ingenious . He took great interest in the theory of farming . He seized and experimented with every new idea . He imported the most improved machinery . He even invented a moldboard for the plow . From Europe also he brought in new varieties of grain , fruit , and vegetables . He planted mulberry trees for silk culture and a vineyard for wine . In his youth he fell in with the then current policy of the southern planter and taxed his soil heavily for corn and tobacco . Later he saw the error of this and banished both . He wrote to Washington : " I have determined on a division of my farm into six fields , to be put under this rotation : first year , wheat ; second , corn , potatoes , peas ; third , rye or wheat , according to circumstances ; fourth and fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckwheat dressings where they will not ; sixth , folding , and buckwheat dressings . " There was no longer the reason for raising heavy tobacco crops that urged the colonists to this policy , for that plant was no longer a currency ; yet , in his diary for 1799 , on September 8 , he noted that he had at Monticello more than 13,000 pounds of tobacco made and unsold . At the same time he had on hand at Poplar Forest , an estate near Lynchburg , more than 30,000 pounds of the same crop . It was the old trap which has caught farmers since plows have turned soil : When farmers stopped raising tobacco the price soared . Then Jefferson and apparently every one else at once produced tobacco ? overproduced it , of course ; hence his bulging tobacco barns . And tobacco is a crop that can not be fed . One sound agricultural theory Jefferson stood for firmly , and that was deep plowing ; but the perversity of his labor broke his spirit on this point , for they continued merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven to raising cotton , because he had his slaves to clothe and his spinners to keep busy , and no cotton could he buy . TRIED TO CURTAIL , SLAVERY Monticello and all Jefferson 's other lands were , of course , operated with slave labor . He was no more enamored , however , than were most of the other Virginia planters , with the unnatural system under which he was obliged to operate , and he studied continually for expedient remedial legislation . He was the author of a bill , passed in 1778 , forbidding the further importation of slaves into Virginia . He made another effort against slavery in Congress in 1783 , which was thwarted . When Virginia ceded her hinterland in the Northwest and it was divided into new States and Territories , he drew a plan for its temporary government . He sought in this to make slavery illegal in this section of the country after the year ' Soo , but in this he was again outvoted . Compelled to operate under the system , however , he never bought slaves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he inherited from his father or who came to him with his wife 's property , and by those whom in vagrant emergencies he was obliged to purchase for service on his own acres . It appears , however , that he sometimes leased his negroes . An entry in his farm book gives a list of 47 negroes leased to one J. I-I . Craven. of whom few were under 50 and 21 were over 90 years of age . He inherited 30 slaves on the death of  |p497  his father . These by natural increase had nearly doubled their number in 17 years and in 1815 they had increased to 102 . At the same time he owned 57 at Poplar Forest and 28 at Beaver Creek ; but he had owned as many as 128 at one time at Monticello alone . Ile had the negroes ' houses built close together , so that " the fewer nurses may serve , and that the children may be more easily attended to by the superannuated women . " Children served as nurses until they were 10 years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the nailery and the girls spun . After 16 both sexes went to work on the ground or learned trades . Of Jefferson 's treatment of his slaves , Edmund Bacon , for many years an overseer or manager at Monticello , said : " Mr. Jefferson was always very kind and indulgent to his servants . He would not allow them to be at all overworked and he would hardly ever allow one of them to be whipped . His orders to me were constant , that if there was any servant that could not be got along with without the chastening that was customary , to dispose of him . He could not bear to have a servant whipped , no odds how much he deserved it . " A PERSECUTION OF LETTERS Jefferson 's daily life at Monticello had almost the regularity of routine . His early morning hours he spent in his library attending to his correspondence . The load of letters was never light , and he penned full-length replies . In 1822 he wrote John Adams , with whom he maintained a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of let-ters " : " I happened to turn to my letter list some time ago , and a curiosity was excited to count those received in a single year . It was the year before last . I found the number to be one thousand two hundred and sixty-seven , many of them requiring answers of elaborate research and all of them answered with due attention and consideration . " After breakfast he walked over the mountain , inspecting his trees and gardens . The middle period of the morning he retired to his library or to his workshop . Nis farm manager said that 1V Er . Jefferson ' ThE MOUNTAIN 497 " was nearly always busy on some plan or model . " The hours immediately before dinner he spent in the saddle , riding down into the lowlands to oversee his fields or trailing the more than 40 miles of bridle paths which he had developed over his estate . DELIGHTED IN HIS GRANDCHILDREN The dinner hour found him at the head of his table , surrounded by the entire Monticello family . This was a changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one of them soon followed her . The remaining two , Martha and Maria , his " Patty " and " Polly , " grew to womanhood . As long as they were unmarried they lived with their father , and , in speaking of his devotion to his two little girls , a friend of the family said that " he was mother as well as father to them . " They were both married in Monticello and their weddings are the only ones known to have been solemnized in the mansion . The girls tried to establish homes of their own , but for one reason or another , not least their lonely old father 's need of them , they seem to have spent most of their time at Monticello . Martha Randolph succumbed to her father 's need of her , and she and her family were obliged definitely to make it their home . Soon the number about the table received the addition of grandchildren and greatgrandchildren . This delighted Jefferson . He never had too many of them . In 1813 he wrote this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared notes with Mr. Adams on the score of progeny and find that f am ahead of him , and think I am in a fair way to keep so . I have ten and a half grandchildren and two and threequarters great-grandchildren , and these fractions will ere long be units . . . . These young scions give us comfortable cares when we cease to care about ourselves . " A HOST OF VISITORS TAXED MONTICELLO 'S RESOURCES After dinner the last hours before sundown were spent with these children and grandchildren , in summer promoting their games and races on the terraces or on the green lawn , in winter gathering them about the open fire and teaching them to  |p500  play " Cross-questions " or " I love my love with an A. " When the candles were brought he took up his book and read until the drowsy hour of bedtime . Such was the life in the home privacy , which his fame , however , often disturbed . An endless procession of visitors , invited and uninvited , came to see the " Sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were office-seekers , lion-hunters , relations and friends , artists and biographers , young Daniel Webster and elderly Marquis de Lafayette . James Madison and James Monroe , foreigners and natives , the great and the near-great , notables and nonentities . They came with horses , servants , and family and expected to be housed and fed . Jefferson had in his stable a surplus of 26 stalls over his own needs . They were often inadequate for the visitors ' cavalcade of horses . There were occasions when beds and food had to be found for 5o house guests on a single night , not all invited by any means . JEFFERSON 'S LIBRARY BECAME THE NUCLEUS Or THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS It was this pest of visitors that reminded Jefferson that he had 5,000 acres down in Bedford County , and the planned and there built himself another house , called Poplar Forest , an exquisite architectural trifle , and thither he fled with one of his daughters or grandchildren , three or four times a year . to enjoy respite from the persecutions of fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so scholarly and studious a man as Jefferson was his library , or possibly more properly libraries , for there were two of them . The first one grew from 1,256 volumes in 11773 , a year after his marriage , " exclusive of music and books at Williamsburg . " In 1814 he made a later catalogue of his hooks , which attracted widespread attention for its ingenious subdivisions under Memory , Reason , and Imagination , and at that time he had between q , 000 and i o , 000 volumes . It was this library which became the foundation of the present Library of Congress in Washington . In 1814 the British ,  |p501  having entered Washington , fired the Capitol , in which the hooks were then housed in a single chamber . That collection was thereby almost entirely destroyed . Jefferson was at the time badly in need of ready money , and he of fered his Monticello library intact to Congress , for which it paid him $23,950 . A CIPHER DENOTED JEFFERSON 'S OWNERSHIP OF ' A BOOK The shelves at Monticello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to which he had referred in 1773 , were his heritage under the will of his friend and preceptor at law , Chancellor George Wythe . After waiting in storage down in the little Tidewater capital more than 40 years , they were brought up to Monticello to take the place of the books packed off to Washington , and it was said that this second library was so extensive that it " nearly filled the room of the one sold to Congress . " Jefferson 's ingenuity extended even to his manner of denoting his ownership of a hook . He did not follow the usual custom of writing his name or pasting his bookplate inside the cover . He used a cipher , based on the " signature " initials , I. J. and T , which appeared in books of his period or even later . Each of the folded sheets bearing a group of pages is called a signature , and it was in those days lettered alphabetically to denote sequence in binding . These initials were just visible , very near the stitched edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monticello , Jefferson would turn to the signature initial J , and before it he would ink in the letter T to form his own initials , T. J. Then , also , if the book contained so many signatures as to include T , he would ink in after that letter a J , again forming his own T. J. If it were a small book and the signature went no farther than I , he inked in the letter T before this letter . This is the key by which collectors still identify books from the library at Monticello . Old age eventually crept on Jefferson ,  |p502  but as long as he lived the spirit of youth pervaded Monticello . We learn of it first as the playground of his own boyhood . One of the next appealing memories of it is his youthful honeymoon on the snowhound mountain under the stars . Not long after , it became the playground of his own children , and thereafter they filled it with gayety and romance until their children and grandchildren carried on the tradition of youth about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people he had about him , not alone his own family and their friends , but also eventually the students of " his university . " as soon as the University of Virginia came into being . One of those boys later left a memoir of one of those youthful assemblies at Monticello in the last year of Jefferson 's life , in which he said : " At the first session of the University I was entered as a student , and Mr. Jefferson was always pleased to have us students at his table . Upon these occasions we were generally seated around the table , when Mr. Jefferson would enter and walk directly to an adjoining table , especially prepared for him , and upon which were placed two lighted candles and a small vial by his plate . He would then say : " My daughter , I perceive there are several young gentlemen at the table , but I do not see well enough to see who they are , so you must tell me their names . ' " Whereupon his daughter would lead him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , when Mr. Jefferson would shake hands and pass a pleasant word with him . At the close of the repast , as his own hand was too trembling , his daughter would pour from the vial into a tumbler a few drops of medicine to produce slumber in case he should be wakeful , and then he would take up the tumbler and a candle , make a stately bow to the assemblage , and retire to his bedroom . " DEATH CAME ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS GREATEST DAY Jefferson ( lied shortly after , about the noon hour , on July 4 , 1826 , the 50th anniversary of the day which he did so much to make memorable . On the same day , almost at the same hour , in far-away Massachusetts , another patriot father and the friend of his old age , John Adams ,  |p503  died exclaiming , " Jefferson still lives ! " Monticello 's master was buried a few hundred yards from the house he planned , built , lived in , and loved so much , in the Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see illustration , page 501 ) . He left Monticello to his only surviving child , his daughter , Martha Jefferson Randolph . It was , however , unproductive and she was without adequate independent means to live there . The first winter 's snows were white on Jefferson 's grave when the interior furnishings of the mansion went under the auctioneer 's hammer . The house was empty during the next five years , when the estate was bought by a Charlottesville druggist , who gave for it his business in town and $2,500 in cash . This owner cut clown most of the superb trees on the summit and made an effort to cultivate the silkworm there . He soon wearied of his bargain and offered Monticello for sale . HOW MONTICELLO WAS REDEEMED Friends and admirers of Jefferson and his family had a project completed to buy the place outright and present it again to Martha Randolph , when Uriah Levy , for some years on active duty as an officer of the United States Navy , stepped in and purchased it . This was just lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for 25 years . The time of his actual residence there was brief . The place was abandoned , so far as proper occupancy and upkeep were concerned , until 1889 , and a less honest building would have tumbled into its own cellar . In that year Uriah Levy 's nephew , J. M. Levy , of New York , bought all quitclaims and brought friendly suits which perfected his title to it . Under his care Monticello 's decay was arrested and he gave it necessary repairs and some embellishments . At the beginning of this century sincere and untiring efforts were made to rescue Monticello from private ownership and have the National Government or the people of the Republic , by popular subscription , take it in hand as a suitable memorial to the great man whose association with it so distinguished it . They were all unsuccessful until 1923 . In that year there was organized a group of patriotic citizens who reflected and united the aspirations of all who wished to see Monticello redeemed . In a little more than five years they have purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; conducted annual national campaigns of education and solicitation. which have accumulated all the purchase price except a bonded indebtedness of $126,500 ; restored the mansion and supporting buildings to their state of original security and simple elegance , and drawn into it , from generous donors , much of the furniture and furnishings which Jefferson himself placed there and used . For all this his admirers are under obligation to the splendid organization and zealous efforts of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation , tinder the presidency of Stuart G. Gibboney ; to its other officers and members , and to the contributors in every part of the country , who have helped them to make possible this reclamation and restoration of the famous seat and its dedication as a national shrine , and so to give renewed national consciousness to our inheritance in the character and achievements of the master of Monticello.
