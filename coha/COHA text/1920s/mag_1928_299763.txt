A sleek pony stretched his neck , drew back his body , shook at the withers , coughed . Soon many another pony was coughing . There was consternation in the Long Island stables wherein were quartered the ponies , for the cough-claque lessened the chances of victory for the Argentine polo team , ready to battle a U. S. four for the championship of the Americas . <P> But polo is of all games the most sportsmanlike , most gentlemanly . Quickly , the Defense Committee of the U. S. Polo Association postponed the international matches until September 15 . <P> At and near the Meadowbrook Club , center of U. S. polo , the slightest detail of international matches is made the subject of almost endless speculation . So important a detail as a postponement stirred unusually eager discussion . Would the added days give the U. S. four , new as a team to international play , a much-needed opportunity to work in W. Averell Harriman at No. 1 , and to settle the contest for the No. 4 position ? Every poloist loves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 of all time . Meadowbrook fans had to scour their memories to recall an international match when Hero Milburn did not play Back for the U. S four . But this year , he can not play , must be content to watch from the sidelines , lamenting the hunting accident which lamed him last spring . And for his place , 37-year-old J. Cheever Cowdin , veteran , is battling Winston Frederick Churchill Guest , Yale star , an eight-goal man at 23* . <P> Would the postponement make the choice easier for the all-powerful selection committee ? Would the U. S. be the gainer by the delay ? Or would the veteran Argentine combination win the advantage of additional practice , better acclimatization ? <P> Meadowbrook speculated , but at heart felt confident the U. S. would take the series , as it had against the Army-in-India last year , and against England in 1924 . Most dangerous threat of the Argentines , as everyone knows , is Canadian-born Lewis Lacey , captain and the only ten-goal man among the invaders . Blue-eyed , slight , Poloist Lacey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On occasion , and notably when he played for England in 1924 , he has been both offense and defense . <P> But against Threat Lacey , U. S. poloists rely on two mighty Bulwarks . At No. 3 will be Malcolm ( " Mike " ) Stevenson , tried internationalist . And Thomas Hitchcock , Jr . will again play No. 2 . <P> Unlike many poloists , Hitchcock cares little for horses , little for hunting . He rides his ponies hard and not gracefully . But he was bred out of a family of polo-lovers . His mother , herself a player , has been friend and mentor of the Meadow Larks , a team which included young Tommy and Stevenson and many another youngster who now has an international rating . It was she who in 1921 polished the play of the 16-year-old Guest , then a raw but distinguished immigrant to the U. S. from England . Polo is in the Hitchcock blood . Thomas Hitchcock Jr . ranks with Devereaux Milburn and possibly Lewis Lacey as one of the two or three greatest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
