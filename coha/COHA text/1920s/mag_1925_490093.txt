The Celluloid Prince SAMUEL GOLDWYN has travelled from Hollywood to New York , Paris , London , Berlin , Budapest , Monte Carlo , back again to Berlin , Paris , London and New York , and by the time this appears will be ensconsed again in Hollywood  --  all in a few weeks . This cyclonic speed is his everyday pace . In the wreckage along his path are to be found a formidable number of tragic and amusing incidents that will serve to enlarge the annals of that mongrel industry  --  the motion picture business . Newly-made stars , a blackened eye in Atlantic City , a score of disappointed blondes who saw themselves the Mary Pickfords of the future , ten scores of cowed underlings , five enemies as against one friend , and bon mots by the bushel . In ' Warsaw , Poland , where he was born in 1882 , he must have discovered that the rule of life , in order to live , is not to let live . This philosophy , humanized by a democracy like ours , means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not land one in jail . He came to this country when he was fourteen years old , and for years was cradled in a factory and fed by a soda fountain . Nevertheless , he developed and eventually became that promising hero of mercantile America  --  a salesman . Once a good salesman ( and we can take Mr. Goldwyn 's own word for it that he was an A-number-One-too per cent plus salesman ) , anything is possible . About ten years ago he saw a picture show and saw himself a millionaire simultaneously . He took his vision to Jesse Lasky , his brother-in-law , who was a vaudeville man at that time . And the story of his spectacular achievements is detailed in his own book . And like most of the other fairy stories of American life , from a glovemaker Sam Goldwyn became a great Prince of the Movies  --  all in a few years . Now he has a valet and dresses and looks like a gentleman , but to hear him speak is a shock . He shouts in a vocabulary of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone into the cloak and suit business and upon whose nodular toes an expressman has let fall a half ton case of goods . If after an interview you are a bit raw , he wo n't know it . If you are all in he will look at you in astonishment and ask , " Vat 's the matter ? " On the other hand , if'you happen to be that fortunate type of person who has a vocabulary of only five words and can shout louderthan he can , you win . The wolf becomes a lamb and will look at you with the dumb eyes of the beast driven to the shambles . Almost everyone in the picture world has at one time or another worked for him . He has never been known to praise a man who has slaved for him except for the purpose of publicity . There is nothing he likes better than to be photographed holding on to the arm of a celebrity . He suspects an employee of loafing before the employee is conscious of it himself . In one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desk biting a pencil . Twice , thrice , he walked past the opened door , but the man still gnawed viciously . He went in and questioned him " What are you here ? " " A writer . " " Then why do n't you write ? " he thundered . Nevertheless , Sam Goldwyn is a great man . Every one agrees about that . His insensitiveness to the feelings of others is a trait often found in genius . To be under his command even temporarily is said to be hell , to meet him as an equal is refreshing after the surfeit of overeducated , clever young men with nothing to say who seem to fill the world at present . When one encounters him in more gentle mood one meets a naive and simple man with the imagination and prevision that have aspects of genius . It is almost painful to see him groping , struggling , bludgeoning his way to clarity , agonizing over ideas he feels but can not express , a man struggling with his own greatness , a man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the industry of which he is so eminent a member . There are so many stupid people in the movies who can not see beyond their noses , narrow-minded and timid little men , that Mr. Goldwyn stands out from among them a dramatic figure  --  an inspired buccaneer . Although he is a man without a background , without education , with a mind and temperament that suffer from lack of discipline , by sheer urge ' of some divine spark within him , lie was able to build up that colossal enterprise at Culver City . After he had helped to vivify the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation he parted unfriendly company with them and went into the production of pictures On his own , organizing the Goldwyn Picture Corporation . He built studios and magnificent offices for this enterprise outside Hollywood . The architecture was in the best Stephen Merritt style and it was to that city of mausoleums that the Eminent Authors made their pilgrimages as to Mecca , to return the richer for it , but not in sackcloth and ashes . As an individual achievement the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion picture industry for a time . As was to he expected , his stone city became a Galen : , bigger than himself and threatened to annihilate him . Here his shrewdness helped him . He got from under the stone edifice he had built with his own flesh and blood and began all over again . In the matter of pictures he has the master 's instinct for reaching at the heart of humanity , but he often loses his way . His own intuitions are crystal clear , but with a mind incapable of deduction he has no confidence in his own convictions and will swallow verbatim the logic of others . Thus he will make up his mind and change it simultaneously , and since like all geniuses his intuitions are his best bets , he is , so to speak , his own worst enemy . He has an instinctive love for beauty . Next to his acquisitiveness , this is the strongest impulse of his nature . He once tried to convince Edna Ferber that his interests were the other way round , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say with great earnestness , " Miss Ferber , I would rather make a great , artistic picture than  --  than  --  than cat a good meal ! " And when he tried the same line of persuasion upon George Bernard Shaw with a view to a forthcoming contract , Shaw replied , " We can never agree , Mr. Goldwyn , because your ideals are those of an artist and mine those of a business man . " Due in a large extent to the energy , vision and courage of Samuel Goldwyn , the motion picture industry has reached the point of artistic development where Mr. Shaw is now willing to entrust the children of his brain to the artists of the celluloid  --  that is to say , for much mezurneh . When this change of heart was pointed out to Mr. Goldwyn he was n't interested for a nickel , he said , and went on almostwistfully , " I spent a whole day once with Mr. Shaw and he got more out of me than I got out of him . " As an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of Countess Vilma Bankey . The story is that he was having trouble with his passport at Budapest . A Jew who travels in that country now takes his life in his hands . Let it be set down that Mr. Goldwyn is never afraid to enter where angels fear to tread . While railroad officials were chastising this Chosen , the train pulled out . Between trains he saw the beautiful Vilma Bankey . Even though she might not be a Countess he felt he had to have her in pictures , and before the next train arrived her stardom was determined , not in heaven but by Mr. Samuel Goldwyn . She is in New York now , a beautiful , charming creature , and those who have seen her screen tests say Sam has put it over again . But like all men who know only the half of it , he thinks he knows it all and is teaching her to speak English . Hearing this , a member of the Goldwyn verein commented that when the lessons are completed Miss Bankey will be speaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is suspicious of the bearer of gifts , for that is being paid in coin of his own snaking . The novel or play lie does not want is worth nothing , but if he wants it he will pay an author beyond its worth , and having a nose for publicity , he will then let all the world know about it . He has the gambler 's love for taking a chance . He met Michael Arlen in London and told him he was interested in one of his novels , but since the two are brothers under the skin , a bargain was slow in the making . They met again at Monte Carlo . " Let 's throw for the story , Mike , " challenged Sam , but the English Armenian refused to take it up . Sam Goldwyn 's characteristics  --  his mental makeup , his viewpoint , his manners , his background , his tack of traditions  --  are so typical of the motion picture industry with its conceits , its gropings , its courage , its exciting achievements  --  that he stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the epitome of the movies , and heir apparent to its great future achievements . WEEK in the art galleries , picked at random , may bring you a sense of elation or despair . Gradually the seeker after painting in its fluid state must come to agreement with himself as to preferences and prejudices . Perhaps there is not too much to be said in favor of an open mind ; a closed mind running on a single track will doubtless bring its owner more peace and more real enjoyment . Pick then , your galleries and make the rounds . Four or five will do you , whatever cult you trail after . And keep to these favored haunts if you wish to avoid nausea and red before the eyes . For you can find nothing in the other fellow 's camp , except stuff to froth over . Your gallery reflects the dealer 's taste and desires as definitely as does the shop reflect the madame 's taste in robe et manteau . Our list has narrowed down to a half dozen and only duty and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This last week we added the Daniel Gallery . The exhibition was the first show of Niles Spencer , a young man out of Providence , who has lived it down better than any one we know . It is told that one of the Providence Museum directors , happening into the gallery , finally became aware of the fact that this same Spencer was the little boy who had to be scolded every day in the Providence art school because he would not use a rule and compass . The old man looked at the strange forms on the wall and sadly shook his head . . " Even in those days we knew he was a Bolshevik , " the director confided . ' fudged by one view of his first show we would say Niles Spencer will be a great painter . We have seen few Americans who organized their composition so well , or who were so successful in the execution . There is not a brush stroke , or a jot of paint that has and " The Steeple " are as stunning as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " City Roofs " is Maria stood right side up and the " Portuguese Boy " shows what Spencer can do with the figure . The Providence museum could buy a canvas of the home town boy for $75 now , but will probably wait two generations and pay $7,500 . For strange are the workings of Providence .
