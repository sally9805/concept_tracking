txt Will Rogers Tells About Washington Table Etiquette We used ' to brag on the fact that , unlike England , we had no. different classes or ratings in this country ; and here Secretary Stimson is called on to referee a bout in Washington 's table etiquette . Washington ca n't go out to dinner till they decide who. shall sit next to who and at the diplomatic dinners . They ought to feed ' em ' Los ' Angeles style , slip everybody a plate and if they ca n't find , the grub , why , he would n't be much of a diplomat . I attended a Gridiron dinner where the President was there , and they seated the diplomats according to what they owe us . England , France , Belgium and Italy were near the President , and the ? nations that did n't owe us a cent were at the foot of the table , - I told ' em " you all better borrow something or you will never meet Coolidge . " Yours , WILL ROGERS . New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
