APERSON with regular fea- tures and no moustache is not ordinarily remembered by the guardian of a speakeasy door . In our own case , we have found that the only way to make certain of gaining entrance to our favorite establishments is by appearing there almost nightly . When we allow so much as three days to elapse , the doors are barred against us and we are kept standing , surrounded by adoring but impatient women , while the rain beats awkwardly down on us . We have found that the necessity of keeping up contact with the various Cerberuses about town makes it increasingly hard for a man to live a life of his own . The other evening it occurred to us that it would be pleasant to stay quietly at home , supping lightly . But it was not our privilege . We knew only too well that sm , at a certain address we were being rapidly forgotten  --  one more night of non-attendance and we never would be able to get back in . On with our hat , and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was clear , even to us , that Number One Park Avenue never could have tottered way down to Fourth Avenue and Thirty-second Street without the assistance of some interested party . We were therefore much gratified to learn that Mrs. Bacon had got her number back after two years . The decision said that Park Avenue was named for the green parklike spots in the middle , and that since there were none of these below Thirty-fourth Street , there was no Park Avenue below Thirty-fourth Street . This sounded to us like an extraordinarily good reason and the whole thing looked like a victory for a private citizen over political influence . Can you imagine that ? AMONG the projects we have un- der way is a plan for remodelling theatres with a view to giving first-night audiences their money 's worth . Frequently , persons who attend openings solely to examine celebrities in the lobby are elbowed unmercifully by the celebrities themselves , and never really know when they are looking on greatness . Therefore , we propose that every theatre lobby be equipped with little stalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that immediately following curtain-fall a bugle be sounded as a signal for everyone to remain seated until the celebrities can run to their appointed places . This will bring a semblance of order into first-fighting , and anyone who has paid to see Edna Ferber in the flesh can go right to her cage without being crushed to death by fifteen people who look suspiciously like Lee Shubert . IN the presence of a Mack truck , we have always been humble . Recently we noticed that these high and fearsome vehicles have taken to wearing , on their windshields , a curious legend . It says : " This driver will meet all other gentlemen halfway on any traffic situation . " Well , when we first saw this it emboldened us , and we soon found ourself meeting the trucks halfway across practically every excavation runway in the city . It was only after acquiring several personal injuries that it occurred to us that maybe we do n't look like a gentleman . WHEN we were very young , we always were moved by stories of Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , saying : " Dig here ! " Now we are grown , and we are less impressed by the descendants of these early Americans . Merely because employees of the gas and water companies remember where they buried a pipe under Fifth Avenue last spring , they do not become heroes in our eyes . Test WE are told of a gentleman who , at a recent bachelor dinner , suspected himself of intemperance and slipped off to a guest room . Reaching the chamber he hit upon a plan to test his condition . He would , he said to himself , pick up a magazine , open it and read the first paragraph he saw . If it made sense all was well . If not , a nap . Friends found him sound asleep a few minutes later , a near-by periodical opened to a poem by Gertrude Stein . The Old Lady HAVING heard of great changes in store for the Old Lady , as attaches affectionately call the Murray Hill Hotel , we went half fearfully to dine there the other evening . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street lamps before the Park Avenue doors still blinking , even as they did at the turn of the century . Walking around to the Fortieth Street doorway we were happy to see the doormat marked " Ladies ' Entrance " just where it was when Mark Twain in his white suit played billiards below stairs . When later we went into the billiard room , it was charming to see two old cronies pottering about a table and chuckling over each other 's wobbly shots , The gilt-pillared lobby gave us the impression it always does  --  that in this building time has stopped . An elderly gentleman drowsed over his Springfield Republican and a longashed cigar . Gray-haired couples shared the deep lounges . It might have been an evening in the nineties except for a radio , which , however , was silent . It is always , we were told later , turned on for Mr. Coolidge 's speeches . For years we have heard whispers that time has stopped more in truth than in fancy at the Murray Hill . It has been true : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been rewound Almost fifteen years ago a chronic illness from septic poisoning sent the hotel 's venerable owner-manager to his room and kept him there . Just a month or two ago he came downstairs f o r the first time , to find dusty tapestri e s , outworn equipment a n d servants who had grown gray-haired since he had last given them instructions in person . With fine devotion they had gone on , ' working longer hours and accepting pre-war pay . The guardian of the Old Lady 's tranquillity is Mr. B. L. M. Bates , an innkeeper of the old tradition . All he intends to do , he says , is to redecorate the hotel gently and tastefully ; gold doorknobs and newfangled elevators may come to other hotels but the Murray Hill will go on unchanged in spirit . One of Mr Bates ' first acts upon resuming active responsibility was to retire an aged cook on pension , who died a few weeks later . Now the rest of the old servants can stay on until they are happily a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One serves the same group of tables that he presided over forty-three years ago when the hotel opened . Two-thirds of the diners are gray-haired too , and many have lived here for a quarter of a century . There is a soft tone of an old Continental hotel about the dining-room . A dame du comptoir sits behind an oak counter and keeps track of things . A trio of violin , piano and cello playing nineteenth-century music broke softly into " Lady Be Good " and seemed almost skittish . Mr. Bates was the first proprietor of the Everett House , one of the city 's oldest residential hotels . Later he managed the Belmont and then leased and finally purchased the Murray Hill . He says he does not fear that the younger set will invade the hotel , except " now and again to rest their nerves . " November Episode WE have word of a melancholy fellow who was feeling especially moody on one of these sad November days . Trying in vain several experiments which he had hoped might cheer him , he finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head usher . " How many times , " he asked when she appeared in the lobby , " did you see Abie 's Irish Rose ' ? " " More than two thousand times , " she answered . The depressed gentleman bowed , restored his hat to his head , and went away whistling . L'Honime Qui Chante FREDERICK JAGEL , of Brooklyn , appears to be the most discussed new singer at the Metropolitan this season , nor is this a matter for wonder . Here is an American who left movie " presentations " to study in Italy and returned to snake his debut at a special matinee , singing nothing less than Radames , probably the most trying role that a tenor could select for his first appearance . It is said , by the way , that Jagel asked to he allowed to sing Radames for his debut . If he could succeed in Radames , he would know that all would be well Apparently all is well . The Metropolitan 's new acquisition was sent to Italy to study by Samuel Eisemann , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before going , however , the tenor prepared a series of roles and sought the advice of many notables in the music world . Hence the great number of original discoverers of Jagel . Jagel determined that he would not pay for appearances in Italy , and his way was not easy at the beginning . His first job paid him about a dollar and a half a day ( opera singers are on a daily wage in some of the smaller Italian houses ) and later on he found a better job at double the salary . Within a few years he had sung at almost every opera house in Italy and made one foreign tour  --  into Holland . There was no pull exercised to call Jagel to the attention of the Metropolitan . He was found , in fact , by accident . Mr. Gatti-Casazza was holding an audition in Italy two years ago , and Jagel appeared without any preliminary heralding , for the gentleman who had suggested that he sing at the public hearing had neglected to inform Mr. Gatti-Casazza of the appointment . The Signor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he signed up Jagel immediately . It was agreed that nothing was to be said about the Metropolitan contract , for jagel was Gatti 's own find and Gatti wanted to introduce him in his own way . The jagel family , in fact , did not suspect that their son had any American engagements in view until they received a letter from Gatti  --  and that letter was written only last spring , when the list of new singers was made public . jagel is rather smaller in stature than he seems on the stage ( he is an expert in make-up and costume ) , and off the boards he looks more like a bright young business man than like a singer . He is proprietor of the most muscular handshake that one may encounter in many years of handshaking , and he is uncommonly affable . He attends pretty much to his business and has little time for social affairs , preferring a small group of friends to a large party . He is not at all impressed by his immediate success . Singing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on schedule . So many roles to be learned in a given time , so many programs to be prepared . He was willing to defer his Metropolitan debut until he could polish up a few more roles . He can not be hurried into anything , and , surprisingly enough , he refuses , on the grounds that he does n't smoke , to endorse cigarettes . Mother Knows Best AYOUNG lady from the Mid-lands lives in Christopher Street and , pending the sale of several plays and novels which she has in mind , is working in a bookstore . For some time , we are told , she has been receiving the respectful attentions of two young men , one a bank clerk and the other an artist whose forte is etching . In a letter to her mother back in Indiana , the girl recently touched modestly upon the virtues and devotion of the two suitors . A few days later she received a letter from her mother , with this bit of advice : " I certainly would not trust an etcher . " Holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York has no holiday of its own and must feast only when the other hundred million of the nation sit at the table . For the benefit of those threatened with an inferiority complex because of this situation , and for the possible interest of the residents of the city who are under forty-four in age , we will recall that the town once had its own special festive day and that it would be observed NOVEMDER. 1 9 , 1 9 2. 7 Gorodetsky in " The Abduction from the Seraglio " : Chauve-Souris ? next Friday , November 25 , had the idea not been given up . It all began in 1783 when Mr. Washington and his upstarts came marching into town . British troops , which had occupied the city as a military possession for seven years , two months and ten days , clambered aboard waiting ships in the harbor , stopping on the way to grease the flagpole at Fort George to prevent the running up of a new flag . But the Americans drove cleats through the grease and if any of the pesky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the Stars and Stripes flying there . There was a good deal of spontaneous dancing in the streets that night and before the year was out the date had been set aside as a holiday and designated Evacuation Day . For sixty years it was celebrated within the city 's limits with as much enthusiasm as the Fourth of July . Folk came all the way from Albany for the occasion . It was the big day of the year for the theatres . They gave special performances with " illuminations and transparencies . " In the musty files of 1824 we find the announcement that at The Theatre there would be , for the one evening , a patriotic play with no less a title than : " Glory of Columbia , Her Yeomanry ; or What We Have Done We Can Do . " There were always military parades , too . In the thirties the day took on an added significance , for New Yorkers chose it as that on which to celebrate also " the late Revolution in France . " Then interest , somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the Mexican War brought it back again , only for awhile . The odds were against it . Chief among these odds was the fact that November 25 proved an unfortunate day for parading . The weather was usually cold and sometimes snowy . An epidemic of pneumonia among the paraders almost always followed the occasion . Finally , in the late forties , the citizenry took to writing letters to the papers about it and it eventually slipped from the calendar . There was one tinselled revival . It came with the centennial of the British departure in 1883 . Two hundred thousand visitors came to town for the affair , including President Arthur and his entire cabinet , and eight governors . It took four men two days to chop the chickens for the salad that was to be fed to the marchers . But the day brought a frigid rain . The paint was washed off the duplicate of General Washington 's coach . Many of the soldiers fell out before they got to the reviewing stand . That was the finish . Tempo AWANDERING fiddler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east Eighties , met with a situation new to him the other day , when a gentleman flung up a third-floor window and shouted that there was a sick man in the building . The musician ceased his capricious tune and cupped his ear . " There 's a very sick man in the building , " repeated the gentleman . A light of understanding appeared in the minstrel 's eyes . He lifted his bow and began to play with sombre feeling a Dante Macabre . Pheasants ITH November brown on Man- hattan 's little hills , the city 's game hunters are suffering the annual inhibition . Much of the repressed feeling , we have found out , comes from seeing golden pheasants flying free and easy in Central Park . These pheasants , it is well to know , did not just happen in the Park . They are not indigenous , like the rowboats and the sparrows. " hey were deliberately hatched and weaned through the courtesy of a Mr. Clarence B. Davison , who , it seems , likes birds and likes Central Park . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborated on the installation of pheasants . They got hold of a considerable number of eggs ( this was some time ago ) and at the proper moment fourteen young pheasants were released and instructed to stay around town . Many people had told Mr. Davison that it could n't he done . The park was full of automobiles , Penrods , soft-coal smoke , sailors , and what not . It was no place for golden pheasants . But the Park Commissioner said go ahead , and for a little while the pheasants were accorded special police protection . They slept in bushes and passed comfortable nights . Of the fourteen original birds , one met death by flying into a Fifth Avenue apartment , where it expired from bruises and shock . Two or three others met untimely ends within the borders of the Park . But the rest survived . Last spring the birds mated and raised chicks . Now they are firmly established residents . Go at sunset to Mc-Gown 's Pass , near the conservatory at 105th Street , and you may see them roosting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the park , stopping to talk to the cops and pick up the latest pheasant news . These Professors T seems that professors are still ah- I sent-minded despite all that has been done in the matter . An interpreter of philosophy at Columbia , meeting a group of his students on the street , stopped to chat . When the conversation ended he asked : " Which way was I walking when I met you ? " " Why , north , professor , " was the answer . " Ah ! " he replied . " Then I 've had lunch . " " You do n't want anything , Henry . Henry does n't want any , Mr. Talbot . " Openings THE eerie cry of " Author , author ! " rings nightly through the turbulent orchestras of our playhouses , and first-nighters , dazzling in their first-night shirts , are crowding local gutters between acts . The season is getting on and we have already been pointed out twice  --  once as Charles Lindbergh , once as Elihti Root . In spite of the discomfiture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening , people go . At nine o'clock the lobby is an impenetrable stockade of sticks , cigarettes , white bosoms , elbows , and sidelong glances . Before the actors can hope to make their entrances , the critics , playwrights , pugilists , and novelists have to make theirs . While a patient management waits , at least three seats remain empty because three little girls from Patchogue have come to see whether Alexander Woollcott really carries the cane he won for being a popular critic . ( He does . ) And they wo n't sit down till they know . Curious legends have been woven around the business of first-nighting . An old warhorse of the theatre told us the other evening that the first row ? which we had always innocently supposed was filled by millionaires and rejected suitors of the leading lady  --  is usually full of people whose hearing is affected . One of these , incidentally , is George Mayer , a corset manufacturer , unquestionably the dean of first-nighters . He has been at it for forty-seven years , untiringly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy A-1 and A-2 . To vary this life , the mother , they say , spends Sunday evenings at the movies . Another childish delusion we once had was that the whole house is either given away by a charitable management , or else bootlegged at fabulous prices . The truth seems to he that about fifty pairs of tickets , not more , are gratis . These go to the press  --  critics for morning and evening papers , columnists , and special writers . Friends of the author and second cousins of the girl who appears for a brief moment in the third act , have to pay to get in . That is , somebody pays . The hundred-dollar seats of Earl Carrolldom are apt to be less fact than fancy . There is a publicity value in printing high-priced tickets , but there is not always a perfect market . Managers with a show that looks good usu ally contrive to raise the price for their preiniCre fifty to a hundred per cent , and get it . George White can and does get his fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a distinct bid for distinguished patronage ( some of them send engraved invitations to Park Avenue residents ) first nights are not particularly impregnable to the layman . We recently bought a good pair of seats at the box office a few hours before the opening . First-night audiences always vary but there is a nucleus which hangs together . Our theatrical friend told us that on nights when more than one show opens , many people make extraordinary efforts to find out where this " neighborhood gang " is going . The major critics are always there , holding out their cup of woe for a pinch of glamour . Sometimes our favorite millionaire , Mr. Kahn , is there ( the last time we saw him was at the Cherry Lane , mildly disappointed that there was no rack under the seat for his hat ) . There is a definite feeling to the performance , distinguishing it from a regular show . Actors will tell you that first-nighters , although cryptic and unflinching , are highly sensitized to the language of the theatre and react quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive barrage of critical faces , are variously affected : some of them tighten up and give a hard , dry performance ; others race on in a fine burst of histrionic passion to which they never again attain . A MODICUM of amusement was A furnished shortly before curtain time the other evening by one well-known and one very well-known actress who were attending the opening . They sat two rows apart , but the one in front wished to he seen conversing with the other , probably for the prestige to be derived . " You 're looking very well , " she said , leaning over several shoulders to make herself heard . " I beg your pardon ? " returned the other . " You 're looking very well , " repeated the first . " I beg your pardon ? " came back the cold reply . ( There was the inevitable suspicion that perhaps one lady was giving another the run-around . ) " I wid , " squeaked the dauntless one , " that I thought you looked very well  --  but everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
