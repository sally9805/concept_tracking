ARMY &; NAVY <P> Last week the Panama Canal was blown up in the imaginations of U. S. Army and Navy men . With the U. S. battle fleet at far-away Hawaii , an enemy fleet was thought to be snoring up the Atlantic Coast to attack Hampton Roads . The U. S. Joint Army and Navy Board , having perfected plans for just such an emergency , proceeded with a rapid , potent mobilization of coast defense units at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay . <P> From Fort Eustis , Va. , to Fort Story , near Norfolk , Va. , an armament train carried the 52nd Railway Artillery Regiment with 8-inch rifles , 12-inch mortars , ammunition cars . A battalion of the 12th Coast Artillery also mobilized at Fort Story together with submarine minelayers , a searchlight platoon , an ordnance company and weather men . Great 16-inch coast guns were unlimbered in their seaside pits and tilted at the far horizon . Then , as the attacking " fleet " steamed near in the defenders ' fancy , shore guns of all sizes roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe and report the salvation of Washington , Annapolis , Baltimore . <P> While the Virginia capes were being defended , bevies of airplanes swooped and wheeled over Langley Field , Va. , to demonstrate how they would treat an infantry regiment and wagon train should they have been landed by an invader . The Army Air Corps ' high command issued winged invitations to the press and all flew out from Bolling field to see the show .
