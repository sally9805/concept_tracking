On his way back from Panama , Secretary of the Navy Denby called at the Virgin Islands and heard the complaints of the islanders who are economically in a desperate position . Now that he has returned to Washington , he must try to solve the problem that the islands present and fulfill his promise to send out the best navy engineer obtainable to make a survey of the very serious water situation on the islands . <P> The Virgin Islands , lying about 60 miles off the east coast of Porto Rico , were bought by the United States from Denmark in 1917 for $25,000,000 . There are three chief islands in the group , St. Thomas , St. Croix and St. John , and about 50 smaller islands , most of them unnamed and uninhabited . Their combined area is only 132 square miles and their population about 25,000 . <P> The islands were bought chiefly so that Germany might not obtain a naval base in the Caribbean . Now the question is : What shall we do with them ? St. Thomas has a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Navy because Guantanamo Bay is superior . St. Croix is suitable for agriculture , but has had almost no rain for three years ; so its sugarcane industry is practically ruined . The drought , which has also affected most of the Greater Antilles , is so great that there is not even enough water on the islands for cattle , and the cattle industry is vanishing . Prohibition spoiled the remaining occupations of the Virgins-the rum trade and the resupplying of ships . Rival West Indian ports are making the most of the fact that St. Thomas is dry to attract ships to their ports for refueling . So whereas once 90 ships called every month at St. Thomas , it is a rare month now when 25 vessels put in . The Colonial Council was very emphatic in telling Secretary Denby that the Volstead Act is " ruining the islands . " Mr. Denby replied that what the islands need is not rum but water , which is also true . <P> Captain H. Hughes Hough , in command of the Virgins for the Navy Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams and reservoirs to preserve the islands from drought . But as Secretary Denby pointed out , the Navy Department is not responsible for the economic care of the territory . In fact , no department of the Government seems to have the care of the islanders . The Navy Department appoints a governor and lends a staff of engineers , but nothing more . Last year a commission from the Virgins visited Washington to lay their grievances before the Government . They spent several days trying to find a Department which could hear them - and there was none . So finally they told their troubles to President Harding and departed . Meanwhile the exports from the islands have fallen off , from $3,571,787 in 1921 , to $754,729 in 1922.
