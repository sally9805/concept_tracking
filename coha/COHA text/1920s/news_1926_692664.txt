txt Training in Colleges . In today 's issue of THE TIMES there is an article from your Washington correspondent in regard to the hearings on the Welsh bill before the House Military Committee yesterday , My own testimony before the committee was inaccurately reported in THE TIMES . In time of war I am in favor of universal conscription both of men and property . I am in favor in times of peace of elective military training in colleges and in citizens'military training camps . Moreover , I would not oppose peace-tune compulsory military training in colleges , providing we had a peace-time universal training system . But I do object to peace-time compulsory military training in colleges , unless peace-time universal military training is in force . Class distinctions of this kind in a republic will not do . They are based upon the discredited , autocratic , Prussian military caste system , rather than upon the I democratic . principle . This statement of my position will be found in the official minutes of both the House and Senate hearings on military appropriations . WILLIAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
