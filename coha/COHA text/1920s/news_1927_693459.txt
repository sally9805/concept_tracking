txt The various claimants for the distinction of " drawing up the Federal Reserve law " have not particularly obscured the record , which is by good fortune reasonably clear . But the incident calls up reminiscence of another Federal currency statute of the first importance , the actual authorship of which was for a whole generation imputed to a statesman who in reality had no hand in its construction . Even at the present day the law whereby specie payments . were resumed in 1879 1s frequently ascribed to Senator JOHN SHERMAN . It used , indeed , to be commonly referred to as the " Sherman Resumption act " Mr. SHERMAN 'S notable achievement at the head of the Treasury after March 4 , 1877 , in putting into effect the law 's provisions , is undisputed . He also , as it happened , was Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in January , 1875 , when the bill was framed , and therefore officially reported to the Senate the bill agreed on by the majority of that committee . But in the actual drafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that , as described in the debate , it placed at the Treasury 's disposal " the whole credit and money of the United States , " Mr. SHERMAN had no hand . The facts first came clearly to light more than a quarter of a century afterward , in connection with a published historical ascription of the credit for the act to Mr. SHERMAN . This elicited a quiet note - from the then retired statesman , Senator GEORGE F. EDMUNDS of Vermont , to the effect that , purely as a matter of history , Mr. SHERMAN was not the author of the bill and had had no share in drafting , it . Mr. EDMUNDS described in personal conversation the circumstances of the law 's enactment , The Forty-third Congress , elected with GRANT in ' 1872 , had a large Republican majority in both houses . It lost that ' majority in the election of 1874 , but notwithstanding the adverse popular vote , control of Congress remained with the party up to March of 1875 . During that short session the Republicans of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crux , then as afterward , was the question of silver coinage . The caucus placed the drafting of the resumption measure in the hands of two Senators , of whom Mr. LOGAN drew up the provision for silver coinage and Mr. EDMUNDS the provision for gold redemption of the paper currency . The party caucus bound itself ' to put through withouf amendment or alteration the measure as reported by this committee . Ex-Senator EDMUNDS used to admit , reminiscently , that ? " some " amendments offered by Democrats " would have really improved the statute ; " but we could not take the risk of open " ing the gate . " He also remarked that " the silver subcomMitteeman and I got " on perfectly well together ; especially " when I perceived that his clause of the " bill was wholly innocuous , whereas " mine was copper-riveted . " That the actual authorship of the Resumption act remained so long unknown to the American people has occasioned much surprise . It should be remembered , however , that since party caucus proceedings do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain no account of this origin of the bill . Officially it would first appear in the formal account as a measure reported to the Senate by the Finance Committee . Furthermore , the secrecy of the caucus discussion of 1875 , the pledge of all participants to permit no alteration or amendment , and the unusual character of the bill itself , as a measure of large scope put through a dying Congress which had just been repudiated in the elections  --  all of these circumstances operated to draw a veil over the initial history of the law . The old Vermont Senator was asked , in his later days , why he had not claimed the credit at the time ; he had allowed his fellow-legislator to get the repute of drafting not only the Resumption act of 1875 but the AntiTrust law of 1890 , another of Mr. EDMUNDS 'S statutes . He would reply , indifferently , that he had personally been willing for SHERMAN to get the credit , because SHERMAN wanted to be President and needed all available political capital .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
