ONE of our friends contends that America is a nation of humorists , which , he says , accounts for the more doleful aspects of our civilization . It is certainly true that the humorists arc organized to the point where they can handle any situation that comes along , such as the recent Wall Street interlude . The stocks had hardly started to go down when Eddie Cantor had a book out , and Mr. J. Anthony had written a long poem covering the situation . Humor has become entirely feasible from a mechanical standpoint ? not only is it easy to get books published but it is easy to get Christmas cards printed , with one 's personal humor as a message . Thus humor is getting into the home . Once in the home it will have its effect on the children , and the children of today , as everybody knows , are the humorists of tomorrow . It is a melancholy prospect . EN the Bermuda liner sank in Wm gray misty water off Am- . brose Light last week , the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the movies  --  the public has seen so many pictures of sea disasters that it knows just how to act , and is well schooled in the heroic formula . Only one real tragedy occurred  --  that was the case of Mrs. Nellie Stringer , thirty-two , of No. 461 Forty-sixth Street , Brooklyn , who forgot herself and fainted as she was being lowered safely in a lifeboat . By swooning she sprang into fame ; her name appeared in every paper . She has our deepest sympathy . It will be hard for Nellie Stringer ever to forget that she was the one blot on the escutcheon of the Furness-Bermuda Line . Incidents like that warp a person 's character . IT worries us somewhat to have Governor Smith on the loose . He turned up in Washington the other day , all tangled up in a scheme for erecting a dirigible mooring-mast at the top of a new skyscraper  --  obviously just a publicity gesture , since there are no homeless dirigibles floating around these days . It 's too bad to see the Governor being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be manipulated for publicity purposes if he had anything better to occupy his time . He once advocated , if we remember , that a defeated candidate for the presidency be made a senator-at-large , for the sake of the man 's dignity and the dignity of the country . That is probably a good idea and one that might also apply to ex-presidents . Coolidge is hanging around Northampton these days , writing for the magazines . NVe wo n't say he 's frittering away his time ; and we wo n't say that Smith has no talents as a mooring-mast erector ; but it all seems so silly when you come to read the articles or look for the balloons . WILLY POGANY has been taking liberties with Mother Goose , which is his privilege , probably , butwhich we find hard to bear . His illustrations arc certainly more beautiful than the ones we knew as a child , but his modernized characters are less wonderful . It disquieted us and gave us an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach to find the pretty maid accosted by a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " she said ; but it was hardly a bright answer under the circumstances . It further grieved us to discover the old woman who lived in a shoe wearing a modish gown , with silk stockings and French heels . Her home , moreover , was not a shoe at all , but a high-heeled slipper . Most dreadful of all was Old King Cole , in a top hat and full dress , calling for his howl and looking for all the world like Otto Kahn , who is not a particularly merry old soul . HE other evening we saw a man I in a brown suit buy the chair in which Lincoln sat when he was assassinated . The peculiar irony of the incident was that his bid was relayed to the auctioneer by a uniformed negro --  one of the clerks at the American Art Association Galleries . Thus we were treated to the macabre spectacle of an emancipated black man calmly transmitting a hid of twenty-four hundred dollars made by a man in a brown suit for the blood-stained chair DECEMBER 2 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sitting when he met his doom . Auctions give us a creepy feeling anyway . The tension of sitting still , lest a raised finger be mistaken for a hid , induces a feeling of religious awe somewhat out of key with the unholy desecration that is going on all around . We never cease to be annoyed at the idle rich who buy relics , in most cases to satisfy a desire for power or distinction . Neither do we ever fail to marvel at the plenitude of a country in which the market value of a letter that Lincoln wrote to the Times is seventy-eight hundred dollars . It 's a great little country . Maybe people who write letters to the editor are not so dumb after all . Lapse THE National Broadcasting Com- pany , at its headquarters , has pages who dress like movie-cathedral ushers and are supposed to live up to the very highest ideals of Radio . Two of them , descending in an elevator last Tuesday , fell into argument , and one said , " Yeah , and how would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With that the elevator operator turned on them severely . " You forget you arc in uniform , " he admonished . Model Makers I 1925 four gentlemen , still in- 1 wrested in the mechanical toys of their youth , got together to play with miniature railroad locomotives they had made . They founded a society which , to justify their taking so much time off from business and family life , they gave a highly dignified title : The New York Society of Model Engineers . The group has grown to about ninety now and includes men who make other things than railroad engines , and avows a lot of serious purposes , such as " demonstrating the difference between so-called ' commercial models ' and actual scale-built models . " This fools the gentlemen 's wives into thinking the whole thing is pretty important . What it really comes down to , though , is playing with choo-choo trains and such . The society holds meetings once a month in a back room in the Engineers ' Club , where they take up the rugs , move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The locomotive builders lay down tracks and demonstrate the prowess of their respective creations . Most of the engines are coal-fired and steam along like big ones , throwing off sparks . These are considered much superior to electric locomotives . One member put in three thousand hours making an electric locomotive and the coal-and-steam men just turned up their noses at it . Conservative members believe in still-life in odeIs and stress the importance of making exact replicas in miniature of big engines , or ships , or skyscrape rs , or most anything , but the radical element likes models that have works in them and will throw off sparks . The society also holds an annual exhibition . This year 's was held in a room in Broadway and , as usual , the engines were most conspicuous . Tracks ran all about the room and the members cheered and shouted over their locomotives and trains . COME startlingly interesting models Ls-7 were displayed at the show . One locomotive , built to scale and about the size of a fat dachshund , had everything a big locomotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Vincent Astor , who is a member of the society , had one of the largest and best models , but it did n't make the show , because workmen dropped it in loading it for shipment . Mr. Astor 's locomotive is eighteen inches high . He has a track for it on his estate on Long Island and makes it pull things and people . Once he made it tow : e Ford . Another time he rode on top of it , in a cramped position , towing cars bearing a load of a thousand pounds . This time he was out for an endurance record . Fuel and water were handed to him in buckets and pitchers as he rode around the tracks . The engine could have gone on indefinitely , apparently , but he had to give up after forty-five minutes because his knees got tired . Other prominent members of the society are H. 0 .

Most model builders are businessmen ; there is only one real engineer in the lot . Minton Cronkhite , another member , is budding a miniature railroad system , very elaborate , with cars , engines , switches , signals , stations , and all , which will be used by the Pennsylvania Company as an exhibit at the Chicago World 's Fair . There is money in making and selling models . A replica of the Berengaria was sold to the Cunard people for twenty-five thousand dollars . The society now includes both professionals and amateurs , although the latter do n't believe much in professionalism . In summer some of the members race model gasoline power boats . F. C. Zimmer holds the record , his model having made thirty miles an hour . The boats are tied by long cords to a stake stuck in the mud of a pond , and they circle around this stake . Making models of skyscrapers is becoming popular . Mr. Berthold Audsley recently did one of the Chrysler Building . Mr. Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to look at it . The architect became bemused and began to get new ideas about added decorations for the roof . At this point , Mr. Chrysler got down on his hands and knees , put his ear against the floor , and looked up . " No use adding any fancy stuff up there , " he said . " You ca n't see it from the street down here . " Welcome APHYSICIAN of Providence , Rhode Island , drove down to New York the other day , placidly , and expecting nothing to happen . Proceeding down Fifth Avenue , he was amazed when a squad of mounted motorcycle policemen noisily put out from the curb as his car drove abreast of them and formed themselves into a flying wedge before it . He was amazed , but it was all right with him as , with a blare of noise , he was whirled through the traffic and past red lights all the way to Thirty-fourth Street , which was where he was going anyhow . His chauffeur pulled into the curb there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back . Well , the explanation is that the Governor of Rhode Island was expected in town that day and the escort had been sent out to pick him up . The doc tor 's license plate bears the number 1 , and when they saw his car they unquestioningly assumed he was the distinguished visitor and took him in tow . The Governor , whose number is 200,000 , came to town , but quietly . Vice , Etc . M a . JOHN SUMNER never asks us to tea and what we learn about the Vice Society we have to pick up from more favored people . One of them gives us some facts about Mr. Sumner 's mail . Although the Vice secretary seems to have dropped pretty much out of the public view , he still gets as much mail as ever . Every morning he receives correspondence from all parts of the country calling his attention to this or that obscenity . Most of the letters contain excerpts , a paragraph or two , a couple of pages . Sometimes a whole book comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another photographs of almost every famous painting or piece of sculpture in the world which depicts a nude . Titian 's " Sacred and Profane Love " turns up about once a month . Some complainants want Titian jailed . Rodin 's " Spring " and the Venus de Milo are pretty good repeaters . Literature From " i 'm so happy . Dear Elbert tells me he 's found a suitable position at last . He 's on the jury . " which " obscene " paragraphs arc most frequently culled includes " Moll Flanders , " " Tom Jones , " " The Decameron , " " Hamlet , " the Bible , and the Anglican Book of Common Prayer . It appears that the last two volumes are picked on by irreverent persons with a sardonic sense of humor . One of Mr. Simmer 's friends and admirers is Mr. George Barber , of the Society for the Suppression of Crime . He is a gentleman with wispy gray hair , who wears a greenish-black suit . He calls Mr. Sumner " Johannes , " after Bach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not ferreting out sources of crime and taking steps to wipe them out , he goes to the Library and looks through the old music there . Not so long ago he came upon some very ribald old songs which Christopher Marlowe is said to have written for the delectation of Queen Bess . Mr. Barber was delighted . Unlike Mr. Sumner , he does n't have to worry about ribaldry  --  only crime . Goose Chase A GRACIOUS person has dropped 13 us a note from Surrey telling about a Pittsburgh lady who journeyed all the way to England in the hope of meeting Bernard Shaw . When the lady got there , she wrote Shaw a letter saying : " Is it enough of an introduction to tell you that I know the man who hacked Gene Tunney ?

" Captains on Shore IITHEN the Leviathan docks , Cap-V V taro Cunningham goes right home to Glen Ridge , where , if the weather is any good , he goes sailing in a small hoot . The skipper of the Mauretania , Captain McNeil , also likes sailing , but seldom has time . He stays at the Mayfair , visits at Briarcliff Manor , and is seen often at musical comedies . ( We got these facts from a man who has crossed so many times he knows all the captains and their habits . ) Gardening , according to our man , is the hobby of Captain Rostron , of the Bereng , aria . He has a home in En gland , outside Southampton , and tills the soil , alert and serious . In New York , he stays aboard ship , or else visits the du Ponts in Wilmington or the Jesse Strauscs in Westchester , still very alert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more jovial ; goes to musical shows and invites the chorus girls to come and look at the ship , which they sometimes do . When not guiding the Paris , Captain Pugnet ( Captain , in fact , GeorgesEmile-Rene Pugnet ) puts in quite a good deal of time at home in Arcaehon . He is quite a flier  --  in the war commanded the flying field at Ajaccio , Corsica . Just on the side he has built a piano and a violin , and can play both . He fences , boxes , experiments with color-photography , and does portraits in pastel , a busy fellow . He has gathered cocktail recipes from every port in the world , and shakes masterfully . Further , he once had one of the drollest experiences in the annals of non-commercial aviation : he was forced down in the Adriatic , released a carrier pigeon as his only means of S 0 5 , and the pigeon refused to fly  --  just sat around . He just sat around too , for twenty-four hours , until he drifted ashore . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking up new safety devices for ships . He has already invented several .

He makes sundials at his cottage in Surrey . His retirement this week will undoubtedly leave him more time for such things . On the other h and , Captain Hickson of the Adriatic , who retires in January , likes legerdemain , all kinds of tricks , and canaries .

On the occasion of which we speak the orchestra had been called to rehearse a series of Sousa marches for a phonograph recording . Stnkowski arrived and took off his coat ( he likes to rehearse in his shirtsleeves ) . The stagehands began to drift toward the door . They were almost out of the place when the first bars of " Stars and Stripes Forever " reached their ears . To a man they turned back , tiptoed down the aisles , sat down , and remained silent and deeply interested through the entire rehearsal . At the conclusion , " Boy ! " said one .

No one has tried to sell us a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to know several perfumery salesmen . One of them accosted us practically every day for weeks before he got to know us . Now we merely nod . The game works this way ( Thirty-fourth Street is one of the best places , if you want the experience ) : A man dressed in flannel shirt , heavy trousers , leather apron , and cap , with a pencil behind his ear and a delitrery book under his arm , loiters near a truck which is being unloaded . He solicits the attention of the passer-by with a confidential " Hey , Doc ! " or " Psst , Buddy ! , " and then relates that , what with this and that , he is in possession of several bottles of Narcisse Noir perfume- , exceedingly rare and valuable . These you may have for five dollars  --  four dollarsthree  --  well , what will you pay ? A Int of men finally offer something , and this makes business good . The impli .111MMEM I ? cation is that the vendor is connected with the truck he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a harmless truck pulled up at the curb , which he merely employs as scenery . Some of the black narcissusers actually have trucks , however , or are truckmen with a side line . They get in heavy traffic , and when the red light comes on , leap to the street and solicit the motorists behind . Sometimes they make several sales on one red light . Men are the big buyers , but we know one woman who was taken in  --  paid a dollar for her bottle , and very nearly swooned when she finally uncorked her prize and smelled the contents , which seemed to be water flavored with something terrible . A similar but more elaborate racket is worked by the owners of a delivery truck of elegance whose sombre black sides bear only the words : " ParisLondon-New York " ? no firm name . The gents aboard this truck would like to interest you in a bargain in necklaces .
