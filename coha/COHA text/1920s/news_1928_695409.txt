Acting under direct orders from Dr. J. M. Doran , Federal Prohibition Administrator , who has been advised that the Philadelphia group is linked with liquor conspiracies in Cleveland , Chicago and elsewhere , an entire unit of the intelligence department of the Internal Revenue service , headed by George E. Golding , so-called " ace " of the clean-up unit , arrived in the city and placed itself unreservedly at the service of the local prosecutor . Golding and his staff figured in the Cleveland bootleg investigation , in which 112 indictments were returned , and the investigators recently ' came from Chicago , where they conducted an intensive drive on the beer runners and gangsters . Since the opening of the Grand Jury inquiry into local conditions District Attorney Monaghan has charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philadelphia ring , with being in direct alliance with the Chicago beer runners of " Scarface Al " Capone .
