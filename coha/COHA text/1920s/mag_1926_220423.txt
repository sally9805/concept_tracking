When the price of rubber bounced far aloft last autumn , different people did different things . <P> Secretary of Commerce Hoover addressed a Congressional committee on the subject of " a long forgotten relic of medievalism , " alleged price-fixing by the English Government , whose subjects Control most of the world 's rubber trees ( TIME , Jan. 18 , CONGRESS ) . <P> Tire manufacturers echoed Mr. Hoover , but at the same time were casting about for more virile means of circumventing the British monopoly . The Firestone interests , for instance , had already announced vast investments in Liberian acres ( TIME , Oct. 26 , BUSINESS ) . Harvey S. Firestone Jr. , shrewd young Princetonian , put off with his pretty wife for the Philippines and other Oriental spots to find other acres where rubber trees might be planted . Last week the Philippine National Supreme Council* rejected his proposal that public lands be leased in tracts of a million acres or so instead of the niggardly 1,500 acres now permitted individuals and corporations . <P> But chemists , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply has been increasing enormously in their laboratories . Last fortnight the American Chemical Society announced that formulae were now developed so that 70 million pounds , or 10% of the raw rubber annually consumed by U. S. factories , could now be replaced by rubber reclaimed from old tires and other goods . <P> Artificial rubber had not yet been perfected for commerce , but the new reclamation processes-cracking up old tires , devulcanizing them with sodium hydroxide solution , washing , drying , refining and revulcanizing , with selenium added to the usual sulphur mixture-had produced a rubber at 9 a pound which compared and mixed excellently with new rubber at 75 a pound in tire treads of the usual resistance to abrasion , the usual heat conductivity . <P> The chemists did not propose reclaimed rubber as a permanent substitute for new rubber , merely declared that by understanding and using it , manufacturers could protect themselves and the public from price fluctuations to which the rubber market , from the nature of the crop , is subject .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
