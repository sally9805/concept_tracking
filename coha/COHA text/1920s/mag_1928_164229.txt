( See front cover ) <P> Brilliant is the spotlight which plays about the comings and goings , the doings and infrequent sayings of Gov . Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . All the world knows when he speeds to Europe . All the world watches for his meeting with the Grand Viziers of international finance : <P> Montagu Collet Norman , witty Governor of the Bank of England ; <P> Hjalmar Schacht , stern President of the German Reichsbank ; <P> Emile Moreau or Charles Rist of the Banque de France . <P> In Washington , a man named Roy A. Young presides day by day over the Federal Reserve Board , central authority of the twelve regional banks . In Chicago , Minneapolis , Atlanta , sit Governors with as much authority as clothes the Governor of New York 's bank . But when Benjamin Strong , lean , nervous , enters the doors of the Bank of England , or when Benjamin Strong , ill , receives the foreign chiefs in Manhattan , no Wall Streeter thinks of the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And certainly no Streeter thinks of such an untraveled , provincial person as a banker in Minneapolis , or Atlanta , or Chicago might be supposed to be . <P> So compelling was the prestige of cosmopolitan Gov . Strong that it seemed almost presumptuous when Chicago bankers ventured , last fall , to ' challenge the wisdom of his international money-juggling . If wise Gov . Strong , fresh from a meeting of master minds , thought Chicago should reduce its rediscount rate from 4 to 3% to aid his European comrades in finance , only bad manners or sheer contrariness could explain Chicago 's dissent . Gov . Strong was cast for the hero 's role in the drama of U. S. money . Obviously , all that remained for Chicago was to be the juvenile or the villain . <P> Last week , Gov . Strong was again in Europe . And his Manhattan supporters noted with alarm that Chicago was showing distinct signs of insubordination , was even pretending to take the lead in the intricate business of money-juggling . Boldly , the Chicago Reserve Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit reserves and wild speculation , jumped its rediscount rate to 5% ( TIME , July 23 ) . Manhattan , accustomed to lead , was forced to follow . Chicago 's press openly flayed the absent Gov . Strong ; screechingly demanded his resignation . <P> Puzzled , irritated , New York bankers asked questions . Who gave provincial Chicago the right to criticize internationally-minded Manhattan and its Gov . Strong ? In New York papers , an anonymous banker charged the regional bankers suffered " delusions of grandeur . " And , if it came to that , who were these Chicagoans , anyway ?
