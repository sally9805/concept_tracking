" The two greatest lawyers of the U. S. " were presented to the Judiciary Committee of both Houses by a delegation from the American Bar Association . The two lawyers are among the most noted of those who go frequently into court to look upon the faces of Federal judges , and both are onetime nominees for President - Charles E. Hughes and John W. Davis . They had come to argue for a bill increasing the salaries of Federal judges . Mr. Hughes snapped his fingers : " I do n't care that for all your Fourth of July orations about love for America . The way to show that love is to pay a living wage to American judges . " He pointed out that in Manhattan a Federal judge paid $7,500 a year is likely to live across the way from a state judge paid $17,500 a year . " In New York , for example , an apartment in a respectable neighborhood costs half a judge 's salary . " In England judges are paid $20,000 to $50,000 , but Chief Justice Taft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve with him get $500 a year less . Mr. Davis quoted John Marshall : " ' An ignorant , corrupt and de pendent judiciary is the worst affliction any people can suffer . No man who is inadequately paid can be independent in thought . ' " If the present salaries are to be continued , judges should be required to take the oath of celibacy so as not to expose their dependents to the hardships which such salaries entail . "
