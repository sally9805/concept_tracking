To Dr. Willcm Einthoven , physiological researcher of Leyden University , Holland , went the Nobel Prize for outstanding achievement in Medicine and Physics during 1924 . He has invented a device by which the beat of the human heart may be seen , measured , photographed , diseases of the heart detected , its action studied . It was in recognition of this device that the prize was awarded . Dr. Einthoven. genial 64-year-old Dutchman , is now visiting the U. S. He is sprightly , small , with a small grey beard , small grey mustache , wears in his countenance the alert and boyish shyness peculiar to men who have spent their lives probing into the physical mysteries of humanity . To a select company of surgeons in Manhattan he explained his invention : <P> Whenever the heart beats , electricity flows over the body 's circuit . Dr. Einthoven 's device records the fluctuations of this current by means of two wires of quartz , so fine that they are invisible even under a microscope , unless thrown into relief by light against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field formed between the polar ends of an electromagnet . In each pole of the magnet is screwed a microscope , one lending light , the other enlargement . Rubber manacles are placed over the wrists of the patient . Under each manacle is a salt pad ( electric conductor ) from which a wire runs , bearing the current of the body to the quartz threads where they are stretched , shining in shadow , watched by the microscope and the lens of a special camera . The pulse moves in and out , currents move over the body and shake the threads , by whose photographed waverings the heart is studied . If the beat is regular and stout , the quartz will fluctuate in an even pattern on the photographic plate ; if the heart limps the pattern , too , will vary ; and its varytions may be accurately measured .
