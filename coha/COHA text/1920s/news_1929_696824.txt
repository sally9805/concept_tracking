txt The conviction of Maurice E. Connolly , former Borough President , and Frederick Seely . former engineer in charge ? of sewer design , of Queens . was upheld yesterday by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in Brooklyn . The opinion was divided , which gives the defendants the right to take their case to the Court of Appeals without asking permisrion of the Appellate Division . The court was divided three to two . Chief Justice Edward Lazansky , voting to uphold the conviction , wrote a separate opinion from that of Justices Addison Young and Albin F. Seeger , whose joint opinion sustaining the lower court was written by Justice Young . Justices J. Adelbert Rich and Isaac M. Capper , in a dissenting opinion , held that Connolly and Seely were entitled to a new trial . " I have not as yet been able to examine the decision or read the opinions , and until such time as . I shall have had that opportunity I will not be able to comment on it , " said Mr. Connolly yesterday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case will be appealed . " Indicted With Phillips . Connolly and Seely were indicted jointly with John M. Phillips , socalled " sewer czar " of Queens , who died before the case came . to trial . Connolly and Seely were prosecuted by Special Assistant Attorney General Emory R. Buckner , who held that the death of Phillips did not change their status . At the time of their conviction Max D. Steuer , counsel for Connolly , announced that he was prepared to take the case to the highest court in the land . Seely was represented by Dana Wallace . Mr. Steuer when asked whether or not he was planning an appeal said : " I ca n't answer that yet . " The two defendants were sentenced each to a year in jail and to pay a fine of $500 . It was charged they conspired to defraud the city , a misdemeanor . " The indictment states twenty-one overt acts committed at various times between February , 1917 , and June , 1927 , " says the prevailing opinion , written by Justice Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips , Connolly and Seely regarding the letting of contracts , changing of specifications , rejection of bids , assignment of contracts and the receipt of money , tending to show that these men acted together to cheat the city . Cites Favoritism Charge . " It was the claim of the prosecution that Phillips , through the favor and with the consent ol the defendant Connolly , secured a monopoly in selling pre-cast pipe for the construction of sewers in the Borough of Queens . and that , for eleven years immediately preceding and including the year 1927 Phillips maintained this monopoly , selling all the pipe , with slight exceptions , used in the construction of the sewers ; that he charged excessive prices for this pipe and that , in the last three years alone , 1925 , 1926 and 1927 , this excess price amounted to over $3,000,000 : that Connolly granted and executed the contracts for the construction of these sewers , knowing that , in many cases , the contract prices far exceeded the estimates of the engineers for the work ; that Connolly repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not satisfactory to Phillips and only allowed those contractors approved of by Phillips to secure the contracts . and . that he repeatedly . approved of assignments of contracts favorable to Philips and for which he ( Phillips ) received large sums of money . " Sixty-seven contracts for the construction of sewers were received in evidence , and the evidence submitted by the prosecution indicated . that Phillips was paid ' for the pipe used in the execution of these contracts $5,458,010 ; that the fair price fer this pipe was $2,008,520 , and that the excess price or graft which Phillips received from ? these contracts was $3.449,490 . " It is conceded that before these contracts were entered into and signed by the appellant Connolly final estimates were prepared by the borough engineers and were submitted to the Borough President . In four large contracts which were awarded by Connolly in August the evidence submitted by the prosecution shows Phillips 's excessive profits on the pipe sold for these four jobs was $719,135 . Again in the case of four contracts awarded by Connolly in April , 1926 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips 's excessive profits for the pipe sold on these contracts amounted to approximately $884,500 . In the case of three contracts awarded in July , 1926 , the evidence shows that the excess of the low bids over the engineers ' estimates was $454 , - 868.60 and Phillips 's excessive profits was $329,636 . " Justice Young 's opinion then takes up a detailed review of the testimony and the objections of defendants ' counsel The court holds none of the objections well founded in law or in fact . Justice Lazansky 's Opinion . ? Chief Justice Lazansky in a separate opinion upholding the conviction supports the conclusions of the prevailing opinion , but differs in some detail with Justice Young . His opinion , in part , reads : ' The proof of defendant Connolly 's financial transactions was admissible upon the theory of ' sudden enrichment . ' ( People vs . Gaffney , 182 N. Y. , 257 ) . But if , as urged , it was not admissible upon that basis , then it was admissible for another reason . These financial transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One advised of the circumstances would immediately inquire : Whence came this money . kept out of the ordinary channels were it would readily be disclosed ? Why were these funds not deposited in bank and disbursed by way of checks ? The method was open to suspicion . " In the dissenting opinion Justice Rich held that the proof was not sufficient to establish prima facie that Clifford B. Moore , borough engineer of Queens , was co-conspirator . He added : " Furthermore , while the defendants were not entitled to the charge in the form requested , they were entitled to a charge that before the jury might consider the evidence of bank deposits they must first find beyond a reasonable doubt that Moore was a co-conspirator . The defendant had a right to an impartial trial upon legal evidence , and this court can not disregard the admission of inadmissible evidence unless such admission could by no possibility influence the jury . It can not be said that the evidence of Moore 's bank account did not influence the jury , and the failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was error . " Justice Capper , as well as Justice Rich , in dissenting , also pointed out that bank books of Moore were introduced in evidence , although Moore had not been indicted with Connolly . Seely and Phillips . Both justices held that the admission of that evidence was prejudicial to Connolly and Seely " nd that its admission without naming Moore as a co-conspirator was error . Borough President George U. Harvey . at his Summer home at New Milford , Conn. , raid last night over the telephone : " Of course Connolly . should be held wholly accountable for violation of trust . Nevertheless , I sympathize with Connolly as I would with any other public official who did not take advantage of the opportunities to serve the people . "
