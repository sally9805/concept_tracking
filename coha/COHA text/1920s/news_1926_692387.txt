txt With a court hearing , in which it will be decided by Supreme Court Justice John Ford whether a receiver shall take charge of the affairs of the Consolidated Stock Exchange impending a group of five members literally seized control of the Exchange yesterday . This group wag closeted all day with the Exchange 's attorneys , Sullivan &; Cromwell , in the endeavor to decide whether the Exchange should go into court and resist the application of the Attorney General for a receiver or suberal for a receiver or submit to the mit to the proceeding for dissolution under court direction . The action followed the resignation of Thomas B. Maloney , President of the Exchange , to take effect Feb. 15 , and the withdrawal from the case of former Governor Charles S. Whitman . The first act of the new controlling committee was to amend the constitution of the Exchange so that none of Mr. Maloney 's closest aids , his Vice Presidents , might succeed him as President . Events Moved Rapidly . The events of the day came swiftly . None was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . They included first the receipt of the resignation of President Maloney and the subsequent reduction of his salary by the new committee from 310,000 to S5,000 a year . Then came the resignation of E. R. Betts as Treasurer of the Exchange , and then the amendment of the constitution . This amendment was understood to be aimed directly at R. Tracy Falk and O'Connor de Cordova , Vice Presidents , who have been aids and friends of Mr. Maloney in the difficulties into which the Consolidated Stock Exchange has drifted . Incidentally , none of the old officials of the Exchange who were friendly to Mr. Maloney appeared yesterday , and the offices of the Exchange were deserted except for a few clerks . The deserted air was also apparent on the floor , where only a few brokers gathered to discuss what might happen next . The five members who literally seized control of the Exchange , through their appointment as a sub-committee by the remaining members , are A. E. Graham , Roger Dunscomb . Siegfried Frohlich , L. P. Moore and Philip Evans . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members in good standing and they abandoned their business for the day to confer with Sullivan &; Cromwell on the receivership problem . Conference in Wrangle . A bitter tfrangle immediately developed and continued for most of the day , it was said . Some members of the committee supported the attorneys in their position that the receivership should be resisted and that if necessary the Exchange should wind up its affairs in its own way , distributing pro rata to members in good standing such assets as might be left . One of the main objections brought up in the argument was the possibility that a receiver appointed by the Court might be an expensive officer , who would be obliged to sell the property , possibly at public auction , for what it would bring , and that such a hurried sale would not be to the best Interests of the Exchange . Under the court procedure expected the motion for a permanent injunction preventing the Exchange from operation and the appointment of a receiver will first go to Part I of the Supreme Court . where Justice Bijur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion to the Justice who granted the temporary injunction , in this case Justice Ford . It was considered not at all unlikely last night , . hat the committee now to charge of the Exchange , for Mr. Maloney is now President in name only , would consent to the injunction , but ask for an opportunity to wind up affairs in their own way . Trading on Small Scale . The turn of ? . iventz attracted extraordinary interest in market circles yesterday , er .. pecially the resignation of Mr. Maloney , who had been leading the fight . fletween the storm and the difficulties the Exchange now finds itself in , business on the floor was on a restricted scale , as it has been since the temporary injunction was issued weeks ago at tile rcquest of Attorney General Ottinger and his deputy . Keys Winter . The morale of the members was described exceedingly low . and few of them , it was said , expected that the Exchange would continue in business more than a few days . All of the provisions of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly complied with . Should the attorneys of the Exchange elect to consent that the temporary injunction be made permanent , it is expected that trading will cease immediately . The next step probably would be the removal of the tickers from the trading floor by the New York Stock Exchange . which would automatically suspend trading on the Consolidated since it is a secondary market depending on Stock Exchange quotations . Incidentally , many of the members of the Consolidated believe , that the amounts which may be distributed pro rata in case of dissolution of the Exchange have been much overestimated . The membership has dwindled considerably since the dues were raised to $75 a month . The building at the corner of Broad and Beaver Streets is about the only salable asset . One of the members who has been holding onto his membership In the hope of an eventual distribution , said yesterday that he did not believe a pro rata settlement would exceed $3,500 , or , at the most , $4,000.               @ @ @ @ @ @
