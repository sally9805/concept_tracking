Countless newspaper reports relative to the possibility of transplanting the eye have aroused a controversy among physicians and surgeons which finds expression in issues of The Journal of the American Medical Association for Oct. 4 and 11 . Prof. Joseph Imre Jr. , head of the Department of Diseases of the Eye in the State University of Pecs in Budapest , pointed out ( Oct. 4 ) that he considers it his moral duty to relate the results of investigation in this connection . His studies have shown him that Dr. Koppanyi ( TIME , June 18 , 1923 ) - who incidentally is not a physician-performed experiments on rats and rabbits in attempts to find out whether or not an animal with a transplanted eye could see . According to Prof. Imre , Dr. Koppanyi cut the muscles and tissues around the eye-ball and left the eye in place . There was no proof that the optic nerve was cut through . He said , furthermore , that in every case witnessed by physicians in which the eyeball was removed from its place , there never was any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. Imre advanced as his opinion the statement that even if the optic nerve could grow again-which has never been established-and even if there were a possibility of transplanting a complete eye from one man to another , the question could not have any practical importance , because no physician should be allowed to , and no physician with any conscience would , remove an eye with good vision for making a rather uncertain experiment . <P> Prof. A. J. Carlson , of the Department of Physiology in the University of Chicago , replied ( Oct. 11 ) to Prof. Imre 's attack on Dr. Koppanyi , testified as to the scientific status of Dr. Koppanyi 's work . Prof. Carlson pointed out that Dr. Koppanyi has been on the research staff of his laboratory in the University of Chicago since January , and that such newspaper stories as have appeared have not been authorized either by Dr. Koppanyi or by the laboratory . Experiments have been made on spotted rats ; and the transplanted eyes have undergone varying degrees of change from complete destruction to mere cloudiness of the tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be secondary infection . In the most successful experiments , the transplanted eye appears normal in size ; the cloudiness clears up ; and , so far as the scientists have been able to determine , there may be some return of vision . Prof. Carlson has controlled Dr. Koppanyi 's work and believes that it demonstrates definitely that transplantation can be carried out with at least partial success on the spotted rat . He pointed out that it remains to be seen whether such results can be duplicated in the dog and the monkey ; and , if this is achieved , there still remains a very high percentage of complete or partial failure which must be converted into success before anyone would be justified in attempting any such operation on man . <P> Supplementing the letter of Prof. Carlson , Dr. Koppanyi declared ( Oct. 11 ) that the charges of Prof. Imre are not true . He denied that he gave unwarranted publicity to his work . He said that the return of vision is possible , but admitted that the optic nerve was not cut in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
