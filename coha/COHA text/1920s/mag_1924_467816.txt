WHEN our little coasting steamer had worked clea.r of the noisy bewilderment of Singapore 's crowded harbor , the reality of the East dissolved . The East again was only a silent presentiment . For several days I saw to port the somber hills of Johore , Pahang , and Trengganu , and behind them each day the sun disappeared in an appalling splendor of thunder and flames . But those hills by the China Sea and the wrack of day above them were in the same world ; one was no nearer to me than the other . The weather was heated and tranquil , and the sea was glazed , for the monsoon was southwest . I was hound for Bangkok . Yet Malaya was implicit in that magnificent dread to port at dayfall ; though how could I enter it ? How does one reach the sunset clouds ? I had come to see Malaya , but I had given it up . I was going to Bangkok instead . Singapore is not Malaya ? it is more Chinese than anything else ; nor Penang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one anchorage to another in the China Sea and the Bay of Bengal ? voyage along both sides of that strip of Asia which reaches down to the equator , and is called the Malay Peninsula ; or travel leisurely in a railway coach for days past inland stations with pleasing native names , or career for ' weeks . over excellent roads , through miles of ruhher plantations , jungle , tin-mining districts , old Malay hamlets , and modern Chinese compounds , and feel all the time that you will never enter Malaya . I had tried every device in an effort to glimpse it , but it had eluded me ; and soon Imust go home . We ought to have more sense , of course , than to try to touch a dream , or to reach that place which exists but in the glamour of a name . The agent of our steamer at one sleepy coastal station , when I asked him whether it was possible to travel inland away from the usual roads , shook his head . He did not know . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever did it . He had been there nine years and had not been more than ten miles inland . That overseer of cargoes and manifests looked toward the hills , and I thought for a moment that his glance was half-regretful . " No , " he said . " I shall never know what is behind them . I 'm too busy . And when I 'm finished here I shall go , please God , straight to Dorking . Do you know Dorking in Surrey ? That 's where my hills are . " And his , I think , is the experience of nearly all exiles from Europe on that coast . Those men are not really incurious . Their youthful ardor , the zest for adventure which carried them out , has been subdued . Commerce caught them on the way , and imprisoned and disciplined them . They have not and will never see more of their fate than the coconut and rubber plantations , estate inventories , poker at the club , tin mines , coastal go-downs , and cargo manifests . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent of London and New York and their unquestioned control is terrifying . Our maps give no indication of it . They seem to have men everywhere in bondage , and you find the chains are as despairingly stout and reliable on a Siamese beach as they are where fixed to their awful staples in Threadneedle or Wall Streets . So Bangkok , another great city , was the best that I could do . Nobody could help me to anything better . I was free to regard distantly from my steamer the home of the Sekai. the hills where the little forest people use poisoned arrows , and where , in fact , life is still unaware that it is more than four hundred years since Vasco da Gallia rounded Good Hope . But I was no nearer to those hills than if I were still in London . There was nothing for it but to remain contented as a happy tourist , and not ask for too much . A week 's journey inland from most of those roadsteads by river mouth would get me to where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming of the English , even before the coming of the Portuguese . But if any sedentary person supposes that it is easy to break through the spell of the settled highways of this world , then he had better try it . Only good luck will get one through ; and I should like to hear how to arrange for the advent of that angel . In another two days we were due in Bangkok . There I should see fantastic temples . smell stale drainage , buy pictures of the place at the hotel office , drink and gossip with cynical exiles to kill the evenings , and then he more than glad to embark again . To feel the spirit of enterprise moving you is not enough ; a door must he found and the key to it . Malaya , however , was closed to me , as in fact it is to all but a few government officials , prospectors , and men who are indifferent to prudence , time , space , and the neat virtues . A young fellow-passenger , to whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain which I did not hear , and the captain thereupon turned to regard him in mild surprise and amusement . " Are you though ? " the captain said , with a wise smile . " I hope you will like ii , but I think not . " An elderly planter next to me chuckled . The young man began to hum a tune as though he did not hear . " How will you do it ? " said the planter . " Oh , on an elephant ; or walk it , if it comes to that . Or take a prahtt . I do n't know . But I 'm going . " " And you call that a holiday ? " said the planter , smiling bitterly . " No , I call it a lark , " said the young man . " I would n't do it for a tenth share in the ship , " the captain assured me . " Do what ? " I asked , in suspicious curiosity . " Why , make my own way to Ulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhinoceroses over there . " The skipper pointed at the night beyond the open ports of the tiny saloon . After that dinner I forgot my excursion to Bangkok . I did not want it . The young man assured me that hewould not obstinately disapprove of my society , and that he thought I could furnish myself with what was needed for the trip up-country at a place he called Kota Fiharn . We should land next morning near there , at Turnpat . It was fortunate for me that night that those places were not on my map , and that I could not prove my new friend did not know what he was talking about , for otherwise I might still have been prudent and continued in comfort and boredom my voyage to the Gulf of Siam . We landed next morning at Turn-pat , which is on the present main channel of the delta of the Kel-antan river , a river which changes its mind about . its channels now and then ; and from there we crossed to Kota Bharu and found a rest-house . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there its Sultan resides . My share of the work then was to go to a Chi-nese shop and buy provender and frying pans ; and my friend , whose name may be Smith ? he called on the Sultan ' s Prime Minister , or Lord Chancellor , or Caliph , to acquire a mandate which would require pengawas or local chiefs to regard us friendlywise . That afternoon , by invitation , we at-tended a bullfight at which the Sultan and his court were present . It was a understood the other . The little champion appeared to be outmatched . He kept his front carefully on feet as nimble as a eat 's , but was pushed about the field , I felt I could only wait for his end . There were sharp , convulsive onsets ; or the fighters stood with horns interlocked , waiting for each other to move . But I noticed each time that it was the big aggressive fellow who moved first . Once the two separated ? gazed round calmly at us while their flanks heaved ? ignored each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had had enough of it . But the war cry roused them , and the cry rose an octave when they met in the shock of another charge . The champion stumbled at the impact . His opponent . instantly became distinctly savage and more active , and the bookmakers thereupon raced round the enclosure offering three to one on the champion , which I thought was ridiculous logic . The champion was bleeding at the shoulder . He was tired , and was being pushed all over the field . Once or twice now , when their horns were mingled and they stood with their muzzles to the ground for a breathing space , like statues , watching each other , 1 thought I observed that the little fellow experimented with the other . He appeared to test him with a modest feint or two . Yet this only inflamed to fury his enemy , who drove him backward again straddle-legged over a dozen yards or so . This happened once too often . At the end of one of these retreats the little fellow played some caper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It . was instantaneous . But there the big bull was , on his ribs , and the champion 's armed front was prodding his belly , daring him to move . The beaten bull , lately so aggressive , did not move . Once he raised his head ; and if there was not in his eyes a pathetic appeal to let him off , then I do not know that expression . The champion understood it , like the gentleman he was . He turned away his head as though he had forgotten some thing , and on the instant the defeated gladiator was on his feet and trotting away briskly to his corner . With our possessions assembled into six small packs roped in rubber sheets , next morning at daybreak we took train to Rantau Panjaug , a village on the east hank of the Golok river twenty miles from its mouth , just in case there should be any curiosity to discover exactly where we were . The Golok is the division between Malaya and Siam . At that little village the chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without parley . And the chief of police , who happened to be an Englishman , was so alarmed by the inadequacy of our preparations and the puerility of our plans that he forced on inc also a rifle and ammunition . I understood from him that I might he required to shoot a tiger or a seladang at any moment .. " But do n't shoot an elephant , " he admonished me " unless you must . " I assured him that I would resist every temptation to harm a wild elephant unnecessarily . Thereupon we marched off . The policeman shook his head over us in mirthful pessimism . It was ten in the morning ; and the spaciousness of the bare and brazen prospect to which we set our faces under that sun was a matter for firm courage . I could have played tennis with the rifle at the start . In less than an hour it was a worse evil than many tigers . For we had to cross some miles of padi fields and open land , alI of it hard and rough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ridges as unaccommodating as granite . We marched toward a line of blue hills , but the shelter of their woods seemed at a distance no effort could measure . Smith was ahead of me , so I could watch the dark stains begin on his khaki tunic and spread till their boundaries merged and the back of his jacket was uniform again with sweat . When he turned to me now and then I could see lie was suffering , for he was of a stout and rounded habit . But certainly this was better than all the motorcars and steamers , for at least we hardly knew where we were going , and had no idea where we should he that night . A spot named Nipong was mentioned ; but by looking first at the chart and then at Smith , I judged that Nipong teas best considered as a fond dream . We eame to a swamp , then managed a small tree over a much larger stream ( a rifle is useless as a balancing pole ) and the track became a tunnel in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen trunk . Nothing could be guessed of that path except that it would get more illegible the farther it beguiled us from the things that were familiar and under stood . It would please itself , though perhaps not Smith , who was a little sketchy in his geography . He , indeed , appeared to be sure only that there was a lot of jungle to be traversed before we reached Nipong , where folk lived ; we were going to rely on Malay hospitality for shelter for the night . So I wondered , under these circumstances , what had gone amiss with me , because it is odd to feel tired yet sure you can light-heartedly continue till the best man of the party has had enough of it . 1 felt I had known the Malay jungle all my life . This place had no incubus . It was still the first day there , and not even noon . I would not have used that rifle on any polite tiger , and it occurred to me from the look of the place that the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had chosen to march near to me had rolled his sarong into a loin cloth . But for that he was naked . He was a middle-aged man , slender and tough , and his bronze figure appeared to be so proper to that somber place , where fragments of sunlight had foundered down the deep silence to groups of improbable and immovable leaves on the floor , that I knew I should be lucky if the two of us were destined to go on like that till we reached the other side , where the Bay of Bengal would stop us at a beach . I liked the mild but critical eye of that fellow . He did not look at me , but there could be no doubt that he was appraising , by a standard we should find difficult to meet , the two white men who were with him ; and I ani bound to say I desired that that barbarian should not view me in any miserable , inadequate , thin , faded , apologetic loin rag of civilization . I did not want my culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound judge , whose verdict might be guessed only in the aloofness of his contempt . When the police inspector that morning had pointed to the far hills and peered at us sardonically as we turned to go there , I was a little dubious of my sanity . Why was I asking for trouble ? But something had happened to me in the meantime . I would have repudiated my past if I could have done so , denied St. Paul , pretended I had never heard of Matthew Arnold , and swapped all the noble heritage of two thousand years of London for a couple of bananas ? only there is no escape from what we are . I wished then that Mr. Santayana were with us . I would have given even the bananas for a sly peep at that Malay as he viewed in that wild our more tenuous refinement . I wonder to what it really amounts ? An accidental beam from the roof of that forest had dropped on it , and you could hardly tell Ancoats from Oxford ; yet the Malay ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pleasing to me . There are other worlds but we seldom glimpse them , We came to the sandy shore of a larger stream . It flowed swiftly and silently out of the darkness on one side of us and into the shades on the other . There was no bridge . Quite naturally I looked for it , because it is our right to cross a river by a bridge , and to find an inn on the other side of it . Our Malays did not pause . They walked straight in , somehow kept , their feet with the water swirling near their shoulders , climbed the opposite bank , and vanished within the foliage without looking round . It began to occur to me that I was expected to get wet ; and I followed the natives with but the briefest hesitation . We are soused to the provision of bridges and such accommodating things that at first it appears to be an oversight on the part of Nature , and an affront to our dignity , to have to wet the shirt . Something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side , as I went up the sandy slope with heavier boots , I saw a footprint not made by our party . A tiger had been there before us . Crossing that little stream , therefore , translated me into a quite different region , where the usual counters of thought were not . current . We use the supports of our civilization without knowing they arc there , and even suppose we are supporting ourselves . Fine philosophers themselves will do this , unaware that without the favor of the rude tinkers , tailors , and candlestick makers beneath them , their minds would give way and drop them fiat on an earth even ruder and more intractable than a revolutionary tinker , and that they would perish long before they could raise a few coarse oats for sustenance . I followed my Malay as though I had not gone over a boundary which parted me from all that hitherto had kept my feet . What my civilization had given me , I realized , was altogether inadequate and counterfeit . It could not help me now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest thought can not move the infernal quickness of a tiger . A little later another stream ran athwart our way . There was no wading over that . It was wide and swift , and moved with a silent . power that betrayed its depth . There was no passage over it but by a fallen tree . The huge butt of the tree was on our side and descended in a nasty curve to the center of the river , which in places eddied over the partly submerged bole . I knew I could not do it . My Malay gave me a warning and trotted over without a fault . And crocodiles too ? Smith went over ahead of me. lie began to treat his foothold with too precious a care just when his daring courage should have entered recklessly into both his feet ; stopped and made to look back ; tried to go forward again ; and fell . I was at that moment on a greasy length of it , waving the rifle about helplessly , and trying not to judge how many more seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a projection and hung on desperately . The current carried his legs downstream . The Malays had disappeared ahead . What could I do ? I cried savagely to him that if he let go he would have to die . I knew he was almost at an extremity with fatigue , but at the shout he became lively , grabbed a better hold , and at last was aboard again , panting . I have no idea how I got over . A tropical rain-forest is an experience which goes far to alter your conception of the quality of life . Life does not seem to be a tender plant . In the north , on the exposed ridges and sandy barrens of the world , life might be a patient but timid invader , grateful for the stoniest comfort , doing its best against the adverse verdict of fate , and perishing meekly in adversity . In a jungle of the equatorial rains the earth itself is alive , and there is no death , and not even change . There are no seasons . Life is visibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a winter sky . It is immortal . It is terrifying in its heedless and unscrupulous arrogance , as triumphant as the blazing sun , and has no doubt that God has justified its ways . You may live with it if you can . It has no other terms . This Malay forest varied in character . Where the ground was high it was more open , yet more dim ; the trees were greater and their buttressed trunks rose like the pillars of a cathedral whose roof was night . But on swampy ground , where day could in some diffused sort reach the earth , we could not step aside from the track . A lower riot of foliage was caught between the masts of the forests : spinous , tough , and exuberant . Bare cables were looped and pendant from above , roots meandered over the earth like flat walls and like the rounded bodies of dead reptiles of interminable length . Climbing palms , the rattans , lifted green feathers into every space , and their barbed and flexible ropes frustrated every pass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protuberances of the masts and spars , and one fern , the elk 's horn , projected its masses of palmated green antlers in such abundance that is was more remarkable than the hosts on which it was parasitic . There was no sound . Nothing moved . I paused to watch some colored flies hovering in a lathe of sunlight and their murmuring might have been the audible energy of the tense and still uprush of life about me . It was while alone , watching those insects , that I was surprised by my Malay coming back to me . He was evidently bothered by a difficulty . He told me that the other tuan was ill , was lying down in the path and could not move . Poor Smith was on his back . He had propped his head on his helmet , and he confessed that this heat and fatigue was outside his specification . He was finished . He could not go another step . While kneeling beside him , pointing out that he was yet too young to give himself as food for ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to touch the leaches off my legs with my pipe , This was our introduction to those indefatigable creatures . The revulsion was mental , not physical . It is a shock to see the worms feeding on you before their time . Such haste is unseemly and not by the rides . I glanced at Smith and then saw a group of them attached to his belly . He had not . noticed them . Flow soon he was up ! How well he stepped out ! Even leeches can have their good points . The day was slanting fast toward sunset , but there was no sign of any end to the forest . I found myself the leading file , and so discovered that when one reached a queer place in the woods , some resolution is required to take it ahead of the others . For I came out of the trees suddenly and unannounced , and saw below us an extensive and forbidding enclosure in the jungle : a level lake of pale reeds round which the gloomy cliffs of the forest rose as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , sure of its privacy , was reposing in that secret bay within the darkness of the woods . Even Adam must have had some hesitancy in the far corners of his garden . The grass rose several feet above my head , and as I parted it to find a way , I thought of tales of the seladang , the bison that weighs a ton , does not wait to be insulted but takes the initiative , and can reverse like a cat . Then the forest began again . Within an hour of sunset , when even the Malays looked as though they had had enough of it , we came upon a wide clearing . The hills of indigo , which had been far from us in the morning , were now near . They were part of the forest . That open space was grown over with shrubs , bright with blossoms , and heavy with scents which stirred only when we moved past , as though nothing moved in that place except when man disturbed it . Its peace seemed as settled as eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there of the sands of old floods as if this were not only another country , but I had entered another existence . Tired ? I felt I could drop . But why are some moments and some scenes of such nameless significance that , though all is strange , we feel there is no need to ask what is truth ? The Golok river was near us . It might have been an upper reach of the river of life . It was of crystal and beryl . The fa ? ade of the forest above it on the opposite bank was in gracious pilasters of palms , with cornices and capitals of plumes , and the roof was domed . The clouds of evening were of rose . But Smith was done . No more of it . The Malays , he said , were deceiving us . This was Nipong . " There , " he said , pointing " is a house . I can see the plantains from here . " Our men stood by , disconsolate . They said nothing . But when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank herbage on its floor ; for it had no roof and most of its walls of palm matting had gone . We got going again . And it was almost dark when , for the first time in that long trek , we came to betel and coconut palms ( no doubt of it now ) and presently to huts . There was a fair cluster of them , all raised on stilts with clear spaces under them , and the paths between were obstructed by the big black shapes of buffaloes . The beasts gave one sullen stare at us and lumbered off in a panic , with about as much sense of direction as runaway lorries . I thought they would carry the houses off their props , and that we should be left shelterless after all . But anyhow , the irruption brought out a frowning and elderly little man who stood at a distance while lie read the Sultan 's letter . He took us home . It was a larger house than the rest , with a great length of ladder to its veranda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a group of children became intent on ourunpacking . The chief showed us the river , where we could wash . When I returned from it the day had gone , and I sat crosslegged with the Malays , dressed like them in sarong and baju , and feeling that I would have gone twice the distance for such a night . The heavy shadows of that old barnlike structure were hardly moved by a little brass oil lamp . Some men of the village gathered to gossip , and the women and children vanished I do n't know where , but I could hear their voices somewhere in the rafters . Brass dishes were planed between us on the floor with fruits and nuts : lansats , rambutans , mangosteens , and a kernel which tasted like walnut . One felt quite at home with these people . They spoke in low voices . They asked modestly about the outer world , but said nothing in criticism . Smith fell asleep , and I lay on a mat which the chief spread for inc and pretended to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the flooring of old durian shards , looking at the gossiping heads of the chief and his cronies , and at the grotesque shapes on the wall ? whether antlers or horns or shadows I did not know . When I woke , the day was beginning to enter the but in splinters .
