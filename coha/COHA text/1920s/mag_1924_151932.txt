The Atlantic Monthly for September appeared on newsstands and in it a biographical chapter , The Portrait of an Editor , by Don C. Seitz , Business Manager of the New York Evening World . The chapter was taken from Mr. Seitz ' book of the same title soon to be published. * With the permission of the Atlantic Monthly , the New York World also published the chapter , the subtitle of which read : " Joseph Pulitzer as He Was . " <P> Said Mr. Seitz of his late friend and employer : <P> " He was always interesting , seldom companionable , taking all he could from the minds of others , but rarely giving much back , his method being to reap the benefits of an aroused defense . Thus he became a great hunter for facts . . . . <P> " Mr. Pulitzer read omnivorously . ... Like most of us who were fed educationally on Homer in our youth , Mr. Pulitzer reserved the Odyssey as a treasure to be enjoyed in later years . He had long looked forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event he found it described in seven rather dull lines . ' I was so d-d mad , ' he remarked , ' that I could have kicked Homer ! ' <P> " He did not care to have an inside share in moulding matters , wishing all his efforts to appear openly on the editorial pages of his newspapers . <P> " Extravagant as he was in expression , Mr. Pulitzer valued judgment that waited on facts . In one of the changes of a generation in the office , when the old heads vanished almost altogether , he caused each of the younger moulders of opinion to be given a beautiful set of gilded scales from Tiffany's-the hint was quite plain . ... <P> " To compress cables and telegrams a considerable code was developed through the years . For himself he selected the cipher word ' Andes , ' modestly taking the name of the second highest altitude on the earth 's surface . He commonly went by the code name in office conversation . . . . Colonel George B. M. Harvey was ' Sawpit ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaiter ' and William R. Hearst as ' Gush . ' For William J. Bryan , two code designations were used : ' Guilder ' and ' Maxilla , ' the latter possibly a delicate reference to jaw . Pomeroy Burton became ' Gumbo , ' perhaps as he himself said because he was ' so often in the soup . ' The code amused Mr. Pulitzer and he was forever tinkering with it . <P> " When the World passed its 100,000 mark every employe received a silk hat with Mr. Pulitzer 's best wishes . He usually closed all argument with a bet when the talk grew too strenuous , and the wager took the form of a hat-fre- quently five hats . . . . " <P> *By Simon &; Sbuster.
