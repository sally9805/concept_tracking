No Caesar thrice offered emperor 's wreath , no Macbeth thrice foredoomed to kingship ever proved so obdurate against election as has Dr. Horace Percy Silver , thrice designated bishop in the Protestant Episcopal Church and thrice scornful of the honor . Dr. Silver is rector of the Church of the Incarnation , Manhattan . He is not to be confused with Jesse Forrest Silver , Free Methodist clergyman of Los Angeles , or with Abba Hillel Silver , Cleveland rabbi . <P> Dr. Horace Percy Silver , in 1912 , was nominated bishop coadjutor of Kansas for his powerful pastorates at Omaha and Lincoln , Neb. , and his missionary work in the southwest . But because he was divorced , only 48 of the 98 Protestant Episcopal bishops voted for him to join their body . He withdrew his candidacy . <P> Later sufficient bishops considered him worthy and elected him a second time , in this instance to be bishop coadjutor of Texas . He refused the elevation . <P> Last week he had opportunity to reject a bishopric a third time . The House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For three weeks he pondered .

It has , I confess , brought back to me many happy and sacred memories of the nearly 20 years during which I was permitted to live and work among the people of the West , for whom I have a deep affection , and among whom I number many of my dearest friends . . . . While I feel all this very deeply , and while I appreciate the expression of confidence and esteem on the part of the bishops of the Church , yet I am convinced that I can far better serve the Church where I now am , and therefore , my dear Bishop , I believe it to be my duty to decline the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careworn , has been trying , as his church paper Living Church states , " to visit all parts of the country that people might see him , not as an individual , but as the executive head of the Church in whom they might realize the unity of the Church . " Of Dr. Silver 's contumacy he had nothing immediate to say .
