Last week began the long-winded process of arranging a fight for the contemporary strongboy James J. ( " Gene " ) Tunney . The champion , returning from a camp in Maine , gave an interview on literature to a reporter in the train and stated that he had spent his last evening in camp reading Richard III . In Manhattan , one Humbert J. Fugazy approached him with an offer to fight " the outstanding heavyweight contender " ( Jack Delaney or possibly Jack Sharkey ) at the Polo Grounds , Tunney to receive 37% of an estimated $1,500,000 gate . <P> Said Tunney : " There are many angles to consider before I make a decision on my next fight . . . . <P> I will fight for the promoter who offers the best show , the biggest crowd and the most money . . . . " <P> Old men , reading this statement , sniffed , spat , quoted a statement , issued to the press under similar circumstances by Mr. Tunney 's predecessor , John L. Sullivan . " I 'll fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , any time , for a good cigar . . . . All the training I need is a haircut and a shave. . . "
