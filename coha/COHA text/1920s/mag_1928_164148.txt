Stertorian grunts of wrath and the banging of doubled fists on tiny cafe tables disturbed a balmy Vienna afternoon , last week , as excitable Austrians forgot their tall foaming glasses of amber beer and devoured lurid headlines . <P> MORTAL STAB TO AUSTRIA ! ! screamed virtually every newspaper in Vienna , except the Reichspost , circumspect Roman Catholic organ of tall , stern , stoop-shouldered , beak-nosed Monsignor Ignaz Seipel , Chancellor of Austria . <P> The headlines topped reports of a furious oration by Pan-German Deputy Deutsch : " Austrians ! ! Today the Italians have erected at Bolzano , overlooking our frontier , a monument and an inscription which reads : Here Are The Frontiers Of Our Fatherland . . , From Here We Have Driven The Barbarian* Language , Laws and Arts . . . . <P> " Austrians ! ! I say that this inscription is a mortal stab at Austrian pride ! Not we but they are barbarians ! ! " <P> Soon the national indignation of Austrians became so great that 289 provincial Mayors rushed to Vienna , called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he despatch a diplomatic protest to Signor Benito Mussolini . <P> Though the 289 Mayors steamed with wrath and sweated in the July heat , not a drop of perspiration stood forth upon the bald , pink cranium of Ignaz Seipel . Did they realize , he rapped sternly , that he had only just patched up the break in Austro-Italian relations which occurred when an Austrian mob stormed the Italian consulate at Innsbruck ( TIME , June 4 ) , resulting in the recall of the Italian Minister from Vienna . Were they conscious that not until last fortnight did Italian Minister Giacinto Auriti return to Vienna . Under the circumstances , and considering the relative potencies of militant Italy and disarmed Austria , the 289 Mayors were informed by Monsignor Ignaz Seipel that he would not ( i. e. , dared not ) protest against the new Italian monument which dubs Austrians , " barbarians . " <P> Unanimously vexed the Mayors emerged and jointly stated that : " Seipel has again surrendered to Mussolini 's insatiable ambition . " Soothing was a later visitor who stayed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curiously enough it was not belligerent Benito Mussolini who unveiled last week the wrath-kindling Bolzano monument . The Dictator was busy in Rome averting a panic and " rotating " his Cabinet ( see ITALY ) . Therefore the limelight at Bolzano was held by a most diminutive monarch , King Vittorio Emanuele III . <P> As the dedication began 20,000 assembled Italian War Veterans spontaneously cheered their beloved little king-one of the few monarchs to visit front line trenches under fire during the War . With a brisk salute , His Majesty acknowledged the cheer , then sat , impassive and noncommittal , while the inaugural oration was pronounced by Minister of Public Works O. Giuriati . Orated he , in reckless , provocative , and typically Fascist style : <P> " We bless the intuition which led us to intervention in the War . We bless the blood generously shed by the 700 battalions of fallen . We bless our scars , the pain of which is now eased by a great radiant hope .               @ @ @ @ @ @
