A collateral reason for the wholesale liquidation was said to be the widespread belief that the several gfederal Reserve ' Units , which are now charging rediscount rates of 5% per cent for loans on war bonds and Treasury certificates , will this week or next advance these rates to 6 per cent . As any advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front the manner banks . a good part of ! esterday 's selling was thought to be in anticipation of this expected move by the Feueral Reserve system .

Wall Street bankers received many reports yesterday which illustrated the very marked stringency of credit accommodation in all parts of the country . These reports told in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad strike and the congestion of freight and commodity shipments in many sections , and of how these inter- ruptions in the free and necessary movement of goods had " frozen " credit in banks , both large and small , all over the Went and South . But they also fold of the factor which . in the final analysis , bankers believe Is behind the whole situation : the refusal or the inability of the public to buy goods at prevailing high prices . This cessation of general buying . It is said , is the cause for the much-discussed " price wars " which are being carried on in many cities . Merchants . the bankers say , have suddenly come to a realization of the state of mind of the public and are hurrying to rid their shelves of goods which only a short time ago were eagerly being bought at high prices . In many emirs. however , the buying , even at the comparatively bargain prices , is not taking up stocks rapidly enough . and with the banks refusing to make new loans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue old loans , selling of war securities appears to be the only method for raising needed funds quickly . Downward Trend for Weeks Selling of war bonds is not something which has come suddenly upon the market The trend of prices has been steadily downward for mane weeks . as witness the differences between yesterday 's low prices and the high prices for the present year . which are shown in the following table : Yesterday 's Tear ' Yesterday 's Net Highest .

The idea that the Federal Reserve Banks may advance their rediscount rates on loans secured by Liberty bonds to a flat 6 per cent basis has been growing for the last three weeks . Prior to that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rediscount on such loans of 5% per cent . but then the Reserve Bank at Chicago advanced to 0 per cent . This was followed by the Bank of Minneapolis . which also went to ti per cent . After that the San Francisco institution advanced to 5% per cent , and last week the Cleveland Bank followed the example of the bank at San Francisco . But all of the others still hold to 5% per cent Nothing definite or official has been said concerning increases by those Federal Banks which still adhere to 5 24 per cent . for Liberty bonds . it IS the custom for the banks not to make any remarks until the definite action has been taken . At the New York Bank there is an understanding that the subject will not be discussed until the officers see fit to announce whatever alterations have been ordered by the Directors , so that no positive knowledge on the subject obtains . However . the Directors of the local Reserve Bank . and of some of those in other cities . hold their weekly meeting today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at these meetings the advances would be arranged . if this is done It may not be known until tomorrow , es the action will first have to be submitted to the Reserve Board at Washington for approval . Bankers say there is no need for higher rates in the New York district They maintain that the banking institution hare is as strong as could be expected . but they point out that there is an apparent belief in Washington that interest rates should be reasonably uniform throughout the whole system . and they add that , because of the more or less precarious conditions elsewhere the New York district may be called upon to render a material degree of assistance to the other districts . The New York district has been doing this for several weeks , but the drain upon local resources is expected to become heavier from now on as the demands from the interior multiply . With this in mind it was predicted that in whatever rate ad. ' , oboes mmi1gght be decided upon , the New York distinct would have to particittot "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
