" As soon as a man votes , stain his right hand so he ca n't repeat ! " <P> So ordered , last week , U. S. Brigadier-General Frank Ross McCoy , who is supervising the forthcoming Nicaraguan presidential election , by order of President Calvin Coolidge . <P> General McCoy explained that the chemical stain to be employed would remain indelible for about three days and then wear off . He refused to divulge the color of the stain , explaining that to do so before election day might cause unscrupulous party workers to stain the hands of opposition voters in advance and thus prevent them from voting at all . <P> Despite this shrewd secrecy , on the part of General McCoy , a story spread like wildfire among ignorant Nicaraguan natives that those who do not vote for the Conservative candidate ( supposed to be favored by President Coolidge ) will find themselves poisoned by the stain . <P> Registration began in Nicaragua , last week , for the election on Nov. 4 . No disorders whatever were reported by Supervisor McCoy.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
