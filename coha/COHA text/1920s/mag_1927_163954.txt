Some in grease and some in bathing suits , some young , some old , all fat , all strong , all more or less indistinguishable as to sex and features , surrounded by tug boats , press boats , ferryboats , launches , shouted at by coaches , fed by trainers , 96 able swimmers got into the cold water at Catalina Island , one day last week and turned their numerous , goggled , and determined faces toward the unseen California mainland , 2 miles away . Day faded . Light came out on the shore . Now an then on the bow of a tug a trainer lit a red flare to show that his swimmer was out of the race . Slowly , doggedly , the rest splashed on . <P> Like music over the water came the sound of their splashing to the ears , of William Wrigley Jr . i It was an inspiration , no less-this swimming race . He was advertising his enormous real estate development at Catalina . He was showing himself to be a patron of sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stipulated that if a man won the race ( this channel has never been swum ) he would get $25,000 and the first woman to finish would get $15,000 , but that if a woman won she would get $25,000 and the men nothing . And yet most of the best distance swimmers in the U. S. had taken his dare . There was Henry F. Sullivan who swam the English Channel in 1923 , and Clarabelle Barrett , the Pelham , N. Y. , schoolmistress who stayed in the water of the English Channel 24 hours , and Mrs. Charlotte Moore Schoemmel ( Manhattan favorite ) , very greasy , and Jean McKenzie who also refused to wear any bathing suit . There had been some trouble about these nude ones-preacher-men declared that , if the bodies of these athletes were exposed to view , there must be something indecent about the race . <P> On went the splashers . They sucked food through ' rubber tubes . They listened to the cheerings of their followers . The red flares of surrender were going up often now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Only two of the men-George Young , 17-year-old Canadian , and huge Norman Ross of Chicago-still faced the mainland . Between 3 and 4 miles from shore Swimmer Ross sighed finis and groped for the gunwale of his boat . That left George Young alone , and he succeeded . After 15 hrs. , 44 min. , 33 sec. , he reached Point Vinvente , Calif. , losing 25 Ibs. in this $25,000 venture. * <P> " My goodness , is n't it lovely , " cried his mother , Widow Jane Young , in Toronto . " George has always been a good son , light-hearted but never frivolous . He likes porterhouse steak and tea . " Wrapped in blankets in California , the son said : " I want to bring mother to California . " <P> Messenger George V. Anderson of Los Angeles , rushing at 60 miles an hour to deliver swim photographs to local papers , mashed himself against a truck ; died . <P> *Hours later Margaret Hauser of Long Beach , Calif. , and Martha Stager of Portland , Ore. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Said Mr. Wrigley stepping from his steamer on which he had watched the contestants : " I 'll give each of these girls $2,500. "
