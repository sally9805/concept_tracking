Jersey City , N. J. , once a little aristocrat among U. S. cities , now a sooty relic teeming with foreign blood , low politics and eager business men whose affairs are deeply complicated by those politics , is governed by a board of five Directors elected by the People . The Director of Public Affairs is elected Mayor by his fellow Directors . For many a tumultuous week , Jersey City voters have been exhorted to change Directors . A Reform-Fusion organization has been fighting bitterly to turn out Frank L. Hague , Tsar of the North Jersey democracy , vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee , three times ( for the past twelve years ) Mayor of Jersey City . Dictator of Private Desires , said the Fusionists , would be a better title for Mr. Hague than Director of Public Affairs . <P> Mayor Hague has been under investigation by a Republican legislature at Trenton . The charges against him have been municipal graft and corruption . The potent Jersey Journal has raked him with editorial criticism . Chief exhorter against him has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffersonian Democrat . " Not a candidate himself , " Jeff " Burkitt sought to " sell good government " to Jersey City . His loud , vote-swaying cry was against the exorbitant taxation which has driven many a manufacturer out of Jersey City during the Hague era . <P> The campaign was rough , personal . Hague called Burkitt " a contemptible scoundrel and carpet-bagger . " The question of whether Mrs. Burkitt worked or not became a political issue . The Fusionist candidates-a nurseryman , a plumbing contractor , a motor salesman , an attorney , a roofing contractor-were obscured by the battle of Burkitt v. Hague . <P> Last week came the election . Poker-faced Mayor Hague and his Democrats won . But his usual majority of 7 to 1 was reduced to 3 to 2 . <P> Peace did not follow the election . Burkitt declared : " I am the most disappointed man in New Jersey . " Said the Mayor : " . . . Deeply grateful . . . splendid vote . . . personal enmity . . . slanderers silenced . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rioted jubilantly in the streets . The Reform headquarters were raided and wrecked . The morning after election Burkitt called to congratulate a Hague police captain at his station . Leaping to his feet , the officer met his well-wisher with " Now you lousy faker , get to hell out of here . " Thereupon the " Jeffersonian Democrat " was shunted into the street , to be cursed and stoned by a Hague crowd . <P> Meanwhile , the State investigation of Mayor Hague prepared to go forward . He had already twice defied his inquisitors to pry into his " private affairs . " Well circulated among Republican politicians in the State was a report that he would defy them once more , send his case hopelessly to the U. S. Supreme Court , then slip quietly away to England , where he had bought a permanent home and banked a fortune .
