January 1 , 1918 . ? Christmas is over , thank God ! The contrast between its gentle ideals and the ghastly realities round about us almost tears one in two . Here we sing , ' Peace on earth among men of good-will ' ; out there , the killing of boys goes on . What irony ! Still , one remembers that it was a hard old Roman world in which the Angels of the first Christmas sang their anthem of prophecy . How far off it must have seemed that day ; how far off it seems today . The world is yet in twilight , and from behind dim horizons comes ceaselessly the thunder of great guns . A frost-like surface of garish gayety sparkles in our cities , as anxiety turns to laughter , or to apathy , for relief . After all these ages , must we say that the song of Christmas is as vain as all the vain things proclaimed of Solomon ? No ; it will come true . It is not a myth . It is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunt us , pray-* , in this last defeat its immortality . Because that music is far off , we know that it is not our own , but was sent into the world by One who is as far above our discordant noises as the stars are above the mists . Whatever befall , we dare not lose Faith , dare not surrender to Hate , since that would be the saddest of all defeats . And the children sang carols at our doors , as in the days of Dickens , as if to rebuke our misgiving and despair . January 7 . ? One serious handicap besets a minister who labors abroad : he can not deal with public questions with the same freedom that he can at 576 home . Indeed , he can hardly touch them at all ? when criticism is required ? save as they may be international in their range . Yesterday , on the national Day of Prayer , I made protest in the City Temple against allowing the increase of brewery sup . plies to stand , on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we have no bread fit to eat and can not get sugar for our children . To-day every brewery paper in the king .. dom jumped upon me with all four feet , John Bull leading the pack . It does not matter if every journal in the land stands on its hind-legs and howls , as most of them are doing . What hurt ; me is the silence of the churches ! The majority of Free Churchmen are against the traffic , but hardly so in the Established Church . Indeed , that Church is more or less involved in the trade , at least to the extent of allowing its properties to be used by public houses . Many of the higher clergy refused to forego their wine during the war , even at the request of the King . The situation is unlike anything we know in America . Liquor is used in England much as we use coffee ; it is intrenched in custom , disinfected by habit , and protected by respectability . Moreover , the traffic is less open , less easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are often of the most aristocratic and influential class in the community . There is , besides , a school oh English political thought winch holds the sublime doctrine that the way to keep the workingman quiet and con- PREACHING tented is to keep him pickled in beer . Any suggestion of abolishing the traffic is , therefore , regarded as an invitation to anarchy , and dire predictions are node . Almost anywhere in London one sees a dozen baby-carts at the door of a public house , while the mothers are inside guzzling beer . Never before lame I seen drunken mothers trying to push baby-carts ! Surely England has an enemy behind the lines ! January 12. - Had a delicious tilt with Chesterton , who apparently regards the Dogma of Beer as an article of Christian faith . Every time I meet him I think of The Man Who Was Thursday ? a story in which he has drawn a portrait of himself . He is not only enormously fat , but tall to boot ; a mountain of a man . His head , seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to be . He is the soul of good-fellowship , and as the wine in his glass goes clown , one may witness an exhibition worth going miles to see . He leads words into the arena , first in single file , then four abreast , then in regiments ; and the feats they perform are hair-raising . If he talks in paradoxes , it is for the same reason that more solemn persons talk in platitudes he can not help it . From the Gospel of Beer , the talk tamed to Wells and his new theology ; and it was good to hear Chesterton laugh about a God unfinished and still in the making . His epigram hit it off to a dot . ' The Christ of Wells is tidy ; the real Christ is titanic . ' We agreed that the portraiture of Jesus by Wells is in had drawing , being too much like Wells himself ; but we remembered other portraits by tiresome hand , ? Kipps , Polly , and the rest , ? very ordinary men made extraordinary and individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Chesterton many names , an irrationalist , a reactionary ideal , ist , a humorist teaching serious truth in // fun , ? but his rich humanity and robust common sense are things for which to give thanks . He is a prophet of normal human nature , and his uproarious faith in God is a tonic in days like these . If Dickens was the greatest American ever born in England , some of us feel that Chesterton is the best thing England has given us since Dickens . One loves him for his strength , his sanity , and his divine joyousness . The Holy Spirit , said Hermas , is a hilarious spirit ! January 17 . ? Dr. John Hutton , of Glasgow , preached in the City Temple to-day , his theme being ' The Temptation , ' that is , the one temptation that includes all others ? the spirit of cynicism that haunts all high moods . Artfully , subtly it seeks to lower , somehow , the lights of the soul , to slay ideals , to betray and deliver us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heals like a physician . Seldom , if ever , have I had anyone walk right into my heart with a lighted candle in his hand , as he did , and look into the dark corners . For years I had known him as a master of the inner life , whether dealing with the Bible At Close Quar. ters , or with those friends and alders of faith , like Browning ; and there are passages in The Winds of God that echo like great music . As a guide to those who are walking in the middle years of life , where battlements of faith are many and moral pitfalls are deep , there is no one like Hutton ; no one near hi/n . But , rich as his books are , his preaching is more wonderful than his writing . While his sermon has the finish of a literary essay , it is delivered with the enthusiasm of an evangelist . The whole man goes into it , uniting humor , pathos , unction , with a certain wildness of abandon , as of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I n my humble judgment he is the greatest preacher in Britain . . ? . January 23 . ? Just returned from a journey into the Midlands . At Manchester I preached on Sunday in the Cavendish Street Chapel , where Joseph Parker ministered before going to the City Temple , and lectured on ' Lincoln and the War ' the following evening . No man ever had a more cordial reception in any city . As a preface to my lecture I paid a tribute to the Manchester Guardian as one of the great institutions of this island , and expressed gratitude for its sympathetic and intelligent understanding of America and her President , in the difficult days of our neutrality . The American Consul , in seconding a vote of thanks , told an interesting fact found in the files of his office . A group of Manchester citizens , knowing the admiration of Lincoln for John Bright , ? a Manchester man , ? had a bust of the Quaker statesman made , and it was ready to be sent when the news of the assassination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do . She told them to send it to Washington ; and it is now in the White House . As a fact , I did not see Birmingham at all , because a heavy fog hung over it when I arrived and had not lifted when I left . I could hardly See my audience when I rose to speak , and felt half-choked all through the lecture . As it was my first visit to Birmingham , I began by recalling the great men with whom the city was associated in my mind . The first was Joseph Chamberlain . No sooner had I uttered the name than there were hisses and cries , No , no ! John Bright ! ' I had forgotten that Bright ever sat for a Birmingham district . The next name was that of John Henry , Cardinal Newman . It was received at first with silence , then with a few groans . But when I mentioned the name of Dr. Dale , there was loud applause ; for he was not only a mighty preacher , but a great political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I LONDON ence that , when Chamberlain was as cused in the House of Commons of representing Dr. Dale , he retorted , in praise of the great preacher , that he had no mean constituency . The last man named was J. H. Shorthouse , the author of John Ingle8ant , one of my favorite hooks . If the name was recognized at all , there was no sign of it . January 27 . ? Have been on other short tour , preaching to the men in the camps , including one of the khaki colleges of the Canadian army at Whitley . Twice , when the men were given a choice between a sermon and a lecture , they voted to have a sermon . And what they want is a straight talk , hot from the heart , about the truths that make us men ; no ' set sermon with a stunt text , ' as one of them explained . When I asked what he meant , he said : ' Such texts as " Put on the whole armor of God , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like men " ; they are doing that now . ' But they are being undone the while by a terrible shattering of faith , and in many a moral trench-fight . No end of nonsense has been talked about the men in the armies , as if putting on khaki made a man a saint . No , they are men like ourselves , ? our boys , ? with the passions and temptations of the rest of us . As one of them put it : Our Padre , ' e says I 'm a sinner , And Jahn Bull says I 'm a saint ; And they 're both of ' em bound to be taw , For I 'm neither of them , I ai n't . I 'm a man , and a man 's a mixture , Right down from his very birth ; For part of ' im comes from ' raven , And part of tim comes from earth . And upon this basis ? being a man myself , and therefore a mixture ? I talked to them , without mincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles of the moral life . Never an I forget those eager , earnest , upturned faces , ? bronzed by war and weather ? many of which were soon to be torn by shot and shell . The difference in preaching to men who have seen little of oar , and to those who have been in it for two years or more , is very great . I should know the difference if blindfolded . The latter are as hard as nails . Only now and then does the preacher knew the thrill of having dug under , or broken through , the wall of adamant in which they shelter that shy and lonely thing they dare not lose . February 18 . ? The American camp at Winchester . Preached four times yesterday in a large moving-picture theatre , ? packed to the doors , ? and to-day I am as limp as a rag . It was a great experience , talking to such Nast companies of my own countrymen ? tall , upstanding , wholesome fellows from all over the Union , among them the survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are in the best of spirits , having lost everything except their courage , as one of them said ; every one with a cold , and all togged out in every kind df garb ? for those who did not lose their clothing had it ruined by the sea-water . Spent to-day in Winchester , a city of magnificent memories , about which clusters more of history and of legend than about any city on this island , except London . It is the city of Arthur and the Round Table . Here the Saxon Chronicles were written ; here King Alfred lies buried . It is the very birthplace of our civilization . The College and the St. Cross Hospital have about them the air of the Middle Ages . But the Cathedral is the gem of the scene , having the most beautiful nave I have over seen . Less a cemetery than the Abbey , even an amateur architect can trace the old Norman style , shading into the early English , and then into the later English styles , showing the evolution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south transept . I came upon the tomb of Izaak Walton , and I confess I stood beside it with mingled feelings of reverence and gratitude . Behind the tomb is a noble window , not more than fifty years old , into which the fishing scenes of the New Testament are woven with good effect ? an appropriate memorial to the gentlest and wisest fisherman who has lived among us since Jesus lodged with the fishermen by the sea . The afternoon service in the ancient temple touched me deeply , as if those who conducted it were awed by the presence of Eternity , and were carrying for a brief time the Torch of Faith , changing but eternal ; a faith natural to humanity , and affirmed and expressed by the ordered beauty around them . Such a building is a symbol of that in man which refuses to be subdued , either by the brute forces of life or by the anarchy in his own heart ; an emblem of that eternal resolve to love rather than hate , to hope rather than despair . March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey at the ancient city of York , where the kindest of welcomes awaited me . Looking out of my hotel window , I saw a music-shop founded in 1768 ? older than the American Republic . Preached at three o'clock at the Monkgate Methodist Chapel ; at five held an institute for ministers ; and at seven lectured on Lincoln to a huge audience , Mr. Roundtree , Member of Parliament , presiding . The Lord Mayor presented me with a resolution of welcome , in which the most cordial good-will was expressed for the people of America . Earlier in the day I was taken to various places of historic interest , including , of course , the beautiful old gray Minster . Also to the grave of John Wool-man , the Quaker , a brief biography of whom I had once written . I knew he died while on a mission to England , but I had forgotten that he was buried in York . Reverently we stood by the grave of that simple man , ? daringly radical , but divinely gentle , ? who was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love and service , of pity and prayer , made him a kind of sad St. Francis of the new world . York is a stronghold of the Society of Friends ? the noblest body of organized mysticism on earth . Aye , the war is making men either skeptics or mystics , and wisdom lies , methinks , with the mystics whose faith is symbolized in the beautiful Listening Angel I saw the other day in the Southwell Cathedral . March R. ? The Prime Minister spoke to the Free Church Council in the City Temple to-day , and it was an astonishing performance , as much for its wizardry of eloquence as for its moral camouflage . For weeks he has been under a barrage of criticism , as he always is when things do not go right ; and the audience was manifestly unsympathetic , if not hostile . As no one knew what would happen , it was arranged that he should enter the pulpit during the singing of a hymn . As soon as he rose to speak , ? his stout body balanced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine-gun fire of questions , and it looked as if we were in for a war of wits . The English heckler is a joy . He does not deal in slang phrases , but aims his dart straight at the target . In ten minutes the Prime Minister had his audience standing and throwing up their hats . It was pure magic . I felt the force of it . But after it was over and I had time to think it through , I found that he had said almost nothing . On the question of Bread or Beer he turned a clever rhetorical trick , and nothing else . The Evening Star says that the Prime Minister is not a statesman at all , but a stuntman ; and one is half inclined to agree with it . Certainly his genius just now seems to consist . in his agility in finding a way out of one tight cornet into another , following a zigzag course An enigmatic and elusive personality , ? ruled by intuitions rather than principles , ? if he never leaves me with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative thrill . Despite his critics the record of his actual achievements is colossal , and I know of no other personality in this kingdom that could take his place . Like Roosevelt , he knows how to dramatize what he does , making himself the hero of the story ; and it is so skillfully done that few see that the hero is also the showman . March 25 . ? At the Thursday-noon service on the 21st , we had news that a great battle had begun , but we little dreamed what turn it would take . Instead of the long-expected Allied ad. vance , it was a gigantic enemy drive , which seems to be sweeping everything before it . Wave af ter wave of the enemy hosts beat upon the Allied lines , until they first bent and then brake ; the British and French armies may be sundered and the Channel ports captured , All internal dissension is hushed in the presence of the common danger , and one sees once more the real quality of the British character , its quiet courage shining most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; people look at each other and understand . If there is any panic , it is among the politicians , not among the people . Resolute , all-suffering , unconquerably cheery , men brace themselves to face the worst ? it is magnificent ! There was no room for the people in the City Temple yesterday ; the call to prayer comes not half so imperatively from the pulpit as from the human heart in its intolerable anxiety and sorrow . These are days when men gather up their final reasons for holding on in the battle of life , seeking the ultimate solace of the Eternal . What days to read the Bible ! Itself a book of battles , its simple words find new interpretation in the awful exegesis of events . Many a Psalm for the day might have been written for the day ; the leaping up of fires through the crust of the earth makes them luminous . As we enter the depths , those strange songs follow us . Doubt , elation , anger , and even hate are there perfectly expressed . To-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ; the earth trembles ; the honor of God is threatened . The Apocalypse , too , has a new force , color , and beauty , as we regard it in the light of burning cities . Its pictures are like the work of some mighty artist on a vast , cloudy canvas , dipping his brush in earthquake and eclipse and the shadows of the bottomless pit . Once more we see the Four Horses riding over the earth . The challenge of the Book of Job is taken up again ; Jeremiah is justified in his sorrow ; and the Suffering Servant of God is a living figure in this new crucifixion of humanity . And the Gospels ! Never has there been so complete a vindication of the ethics of Jesus . If , the Facts now say , you take the anti-Christ point of view , this is what it means . Repent , or the Kingdom of Hell will swallow you up ! Thus the Galilean triumphs , in the terror of denying his words , no less than in the blessing of obeying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' March 31 . ? Easter Day ! Dr. Bendel Harris tells how , in the musty pages of the Journal of a learned society , he came upon a revealing fact . It was there recorded that , on a morning in May , 1797 , which broke calmly after a stormy night , it was possible to see from the dills of Folkestone even the color of the cottages on the French mainland . In the spiritual world , also , there is the record of such a day of clear tranquillity , when the fierce night of the Passion bid passed , and the day of the Resurrection dawned white and serene . On // that Day , and until the Ascension , ? when the Great Adventurer was welcomed home , ? the Unseen World was known to be near , homelike , and real .

When its bells have fallen into silence , and its lilies have faded into dust , pray God there may live in our hearts the promise that , after the winter of war , there shall be a springtime of peace and good-will ! When one thinks of the number of the fallen , and the heartache that follows the evening sun around the world , it is not strange that many seek communication , as well as communion , with the dead ? longing to see even in a filmy vapor the outlines of forms familiar and dear .

Since then , the walls of the universe have been pushed back into infinity , 382 PREACHING and the old scenery of faith has grown dim . Admit that its imagery was crude ; it did help the imagination , upon which both faith and hope lean more heavily than we are aware .

Someone told Inc that God could be to me all that my husband was and more . And so I got into the way of defying God in my heart . ' Now and here , ' I used to say , ' this is what I want and God ca n't give it to me . ' After a while I came , somehow , to feel that God liked the honesty of it ; liked this downright telling Him all my needs , though I had no belief that He could help me .

No spring drive is equal to the drive of spring itself , when April comes marching down the world . Kew Garden is like a bit of paradise , and neither war nor woe can mar its glory . How the English love flowers ! Even in the slums of London ? which are among the most dismal and God-forsaken spots on earth ? one sees in the windows tiny pots of flowers , adding a touch of color to the drab and dingy scene . At the front , in dugouts , one finds old IN LONDON tin cans full of flowers , gathered from no one knows where . Each English home is walled in for privacy , ? unlike our American way , ? and earls has its own garden of flowers , like a little Eden . One of the first things an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the family spend much of their time in summer . April sends everybody digging in the garden . And such bird-song ! The day begins with a concert , and there is an anthem or a solo at any hour . They sing as if the heart of the world were a mystic , unfathomable joy ; and even a pessimist like Thomas Hardy wondered what se. cret the ' Darkling Thrush ' knew that he did not know ; and , further , what right he had to sing in such a world as this . After listening to the birds , use can not despair of man , seeing Nature at the task of endlessly renewing her life . His war , his statecraft , his science , mac be follies or sins ; but his life is only budding even yet , and the flower is ydt to be . So one feels in April , with a lilac beneath the window . April 20 . ? Housekeeping in Eng . land , for an American woman , is a trying enough experience at any time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel conditions are so bad . Until the rationing went into effect , it was a problem to get anything to eat , as the shops would not take new customers . Even now the bread tastes as if it had been made out of sawdust ; and butter being almost an unknown quality , the margarine , like the sins of the King , is Hamlet , smells to heaven . Shopping is an adventure . Literally one has to deal , not only with ' the butcher , the baker , and the candlestick-maker , ' but with the fish-market , the greengrocer , the dry grocer , ? everything at a different place , ? so it takes time and heroic patience , and even then one often comes home empty-handed . As a Last resort , we fall back on eggs and peanuts , ? monkey-nuts , the English call them , ? to both of which I take off my hat . It is impossible for one person to keep an English house clean , ? it is so ill-arranged , and cluttered up with brae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor ? no brooms : and the housemaid must get down on her knees , with a dustpan and hand-brush , to sweep the room . There is enough brass in the house to keep one able-bodied person busy polishing it . Arnold Bennett has more than one passage of concentrated indignation about the time and energy spent in polishing brass in English houses . It is almost a profession . One compensation is the son-voiced , well-trained English servants , and often even they are either thievish or sluttish . April 2.5 . ? Twice I have heard Bernard Shaw lecture recently , and have not vet recovered from the shock and surprise of meeting him . My idea of Shaw was a man alert , aggressive , self-centred , vastly conceited , craving publicity , laying claim to an omniscience that would astonish most deities .

The most garrulous man in Europe before the war , he was smitten dumb by the insanity of it , having no word of comfort or command . Unlike Romain Rolland , he Maid not even frame a bitter condemnation of it . So , after one or two feeble protests , he went back into his drawing-room , pulled the blinds down , // and drank China tea out of his dainty cups , leaving the world to stew in its own juice . Who can describe the fineness , the fatuousness , the futility of him ! Whether prophet or harlequin , he has shot his bolt and missed the mark . Of course , the artist will live on in his work ? most vividly , perhaps , in his sham-shattering wit . April 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Family mean in the life of the British people . Our idea of the King is colored by our republican preconceptions , to say nothing of our prejudices ? not knowing that England is in many ways more democratic than America . The other day , in the City Temple , an American minister spoke of the King as an animated flag , ' little dreaming of the thing of which he is a symbol and the profound affection in which he is held . There is something spiritual in this devotion to the King , something mystical , and the Empire would hardly hold together without it . The Royal Family is really an exaltation of the Home , which is ever the centre of British patriotism . Never , in their true hours , do the English people brag of Britain as a world-power , actual or potential . It is always the home and the hearth , ? now to be defended , ? and nowhere is the home more sacred and tender . Of every Briton we may say , as Bunyan said of Greatheart : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did was that he did it for pure love of his Country . ' This sentiment finds incarnation in the Royal Family , in whom the Home rises above party and is untouched by the gusts of passion .

Gentle-hearted , if not actually shy , one feels t hat the formalism and ceremony of the Court appeal less to the King than to the Queen , whose stateliness sometimes leaves an impression of aloofness . Something of the same shyness one detects in the modest , manly , happy-hearted Prince of Wales , whose personality is so captivating alike in its simplicity and its sincerity .

Dr. Jowett began his ministry at Westminster Chapel today , ? the anniversary of Pentecost , ? welcomed by a hideous air-raid . Somehow , while Dr. Jowett always kindles my imagination , he never gives me that sense of reality which is the greatest thing in preaching . One enjoys his musical voice , his exquisite elocution , his mastery of the art of illustration , and his fastidious style ; but the substance of his sermons is incredibly thin . Of course , this is due , in large part , to the theory of popular preaching on which he works . His method is to take a single idea ? large or small ? and turn it over and over , like a gem , revealing all its facets , . on the ground that one idea is all that the average audience is equal to . Of this method Dr. Jowett is a consummate master , and it is a joy to see him make use of it , though at times it leads to a tedious repetition of the text . Often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a brilliant novelist , who must needs make up in scenery what is lacking in plot .

No , his forte is personal religious experience of a mild evangelical type ; and to a convinced Christian audience of that tradition and training he has a ministry of edification and comfort . But for the typical man of modern mind , caught in the currents and alive to the agitations of our day , Dr. Jowett has no message . However , we must not expect everything from any one servant of God , and the painter is needed as well as the prophet . June 2 . ?

Attended a Ministerial Fraternal to-day , and greatly enjoyed the freedom and frankness of the discussion . A conservative in England would be a radical in America , so far are they in advance of us . Evidently our English brethren have gotten over the theological mumps , measles , and whooping-cough . For one thing , they have accepted the results of the critical study of the Bible , without losing any of the warmth and glow of evangelical faith , ? uniting liberal thought with orthodoxy of the heart , ? as we in America have not succeeded in doing .

The spirit of the meeting was most fraternal , and for one , felt that fellowship is both creative and revealing . June 25 . ?

' Why , your men are mystics ; they are crusaders , ' said an English journalist to me recently ; and I confess they do have that bearing ? for such they really are . Last night , in a coffee-house on the Strand , I asked the Cockney proprietor if he had seen many American boys and what he thought of them . Something like this is what I heard : ? Yerce , and I like what I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , y ' know ? officers an ' men , just like pals together . Talks to yeh mately-like ? know what I mean ? ? man to man sort o ' thing . Nice , likable chaps , I alwis finds ' em . Bit of a change after all these damn foreigners . I get on with ' em top-'ole . And eat ? Fair clean me out . Funny-the way they looks at London , though . Mad about it , y ' know . I bin in London yers an yers , and it do n't worry me . Wants to know where that bloke put ' is cloak down in the mud for some Queen , and ' ow many generals is buried in Westminster Abbey . ' Ow should I know ? I live in Camden Town . I got a business t ' attend to . Likable boys , though . ' Ere ' s to ' em ! ' July 4 . ? Went to the American Army and Navy baseball game , taking as my guests a Member of Parliament and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball game since time began . The King pitched the first ball , and did it right well , too . The papers say he has been practising for days . Then bedlam broke loose ; barbaric pandemonium reigned . Megaphones , whistles , every kind of instrument of torture kept accompaniment to tossing arms and dancing hats ? while the grandstand gave such an exhibition of ' rooting ' in slang as I never heard before . Much of the slang was new to me , and to interpret it to my English friends , and at the same time explain the game , was a task for a genius . Amazement sat upon their faces . They had never imagined that a hard business people could explode in such a hysteria of play . An English crowd is orderly and ladylike in comparison . Of course , the players , aware of an audience at once distinguished and astonished , put on extra airs ; and as the game went on , the fun became faster a nd more furious . My friends would stop their ears to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfailing courtesy , to see , hear , and understand everything . The Navy won , and one last , long , lusty yell concluded the choral service of the day . July ? The Miracle of St. Dunstan 's . ' It is no exaggeration , if by miracle you mean the triumph of spirit over matter and untoward disaster . St. Dunstan 's is the college where young men who gave their eyes for their country learn to be blind ; and as I walked through it to-day I thought of Henley 's lines : Manyof the men are horribly disfigured , and it is a mercy that they can not see t heir own faces . Yet , for the most part , they are a jolly set , accepting the inevitable with that spirit of sport which is so great a trait of their race . At least , the totally blind are happy . Those who see partially , and do not know how it will turn out , mope a good deal . At the IN LONDON head of the college is Sir Arthur Pearson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way in the dark ? a blind leader of the blind . It is wonderful to hear him talk to a boy brought into the college dejected and rebellious against his fate . There is no maudlin sent intent . It is much easier to cry than to succor . They sit hand in hand , ? comrades in a conquest , ? while Sir Arthur tells the lad , out of his own experience , that , though night has come at noon , the day is not ended . His words , taken out of their context and atmosphere , might sound preachy , as he tells how he refused to be beaten , and how darkness has its surprises . All honor to Sir Arthur , ? Knight of the Dark Table . ? unforgettable for his courage , his chivalry , and his cheerfulness ! ( Early in August I went again tolmerica , on another speaking tour , crossing the he at Liverpool , in the glow of a miraculous sunset , the sacramental beauty of rebid ; haunts inc still . Time out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nankeen trousers strapped under his instep , his Ear swallow-tail coat and brass buttons , and hi , ancient high hat . It was not easy to rerog. nine him clad in khaki , wearing a gas-mask and a ' tin lid , ' and going over the top with a Springfield rifle in his hand ; and that change in outward garb was a visible sign of much else . Down the streets of New York , at midnight , one saw long lines of rare marching , singing ' Over There% and Service Stars were everywhere , changing from silver to gold . It was an awe-inspiring America , ? new in its unity , its pmver , and its vision of duty , ? albeit to-day , it seems like a dim dream of some previous state of existence . Returning to England in October , my ship was one of fifteen loaded with troops , following a zigzag course over a lonely sea . It was at the time of the influenza epidemic , and almost every ship kept a funeral flag flying all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of an enemy submarine . Once more , on a Thursday noon , I took up my labors at the City Temple , in an address- entitled The New America , ' in which I tried to describe the novel experience of rediscovering me own country . Events moved rapidly , and I need add only one or two items from the diary , telling of the end of the greatest war in history , the meaning and issue of which are locked in the bosom of God . ) October 25 . ? Three times since I returned I have spoken to groups in behalf of Anglo-American friendship , but to little avail . My audiences were already utterly convinced , and it was like arguing with Miss Pankhurst in favor of woman suffrage ? as useless as rain at sea . Somehow we never get beyond the courtesies and commonplaces of after-dinner eloquence . Yet the matter is of vital importance just now . Already there are rumors of friction between our boys and the ' Tommies . These are little things , but the sum of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour so many reactions of personal antagonism may be fatal . Not much idealism is left after the long struggle , and one fears a dreadful reaction , ? a swift , hideous slip backward , ? driving Britain and America further apart than they were before the war . Little groups do something , but what we need is some great gesture , to compel attention and dramatize the scene for the masses on both sides of the sea . Frankly , I am not clear as to the best method ? except that we have not found it . Even now , all feel that the end of the war is near , and one detects tokens which foretell a different mood when peace arrives . October 29 . ? Ever and again one hears rumors of a revolution in England in which things will be turned upside down . One might be more alarmed , but for the fact that the revolution has already taken place . The old England has gone , taking with it much that was lovely and fair ; a new England is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook , ? not only changing in temper , but ao- tually changing hands . As the Napoleonic wars ended the aristocratic epoch and brought the middle class to the fore , so the great war has ended the rule of the middle class and will bring the man down under to the top . Of course , as to outward appearance , the aristocratic and middle classes still rule ; but their ideas do not rule . There will be no violent upheaval in England ; the genius of the British mind ? a practical mysticism , so to name it , though the practicality is often more manifest than the mysticism ? will not let it be so . Again and again I have seen them drawn up in battle-array , ready for a fight to a finish ? t hen , the next moment , they begin to parley , to give and take ; and , finally , they compromise , each getting something and nobody getting all he asked . Therein they are wise , and their long political experience , their instinct for the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in good stead in these days . Besides , if English society is a house of three stories , the house has been so shaken by the earthquake of war that all classes have a new sense of kinship and obligation . No doubt there will be flare-ups in Wales , or among the hot-heads on the Clyde ; but , there is little danger of anything more . November 8 . ? Went to Oxford last night to hear Professor Gilbert Murray lecture on the Peloponnesian War of the Greeks as compared with our great war ; and his words haunt me . With an uncanny felicity , the great scholar ? who is also a great citizen ? told the story of the war that destroyed Greek civilization ; and the parallel with the present war was deadly , even down to minute details . About the only differences are the magnitude of the armies and the murderous efficiency of the weapons we now employ . As I listened , I found myself wondering whether I was in Oxford or in ancient Athens . The lecturer has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human color . Euripides and Aristophanes seemed like contemporaries . What depressed me was the monotonous sameness of human nature throughout the ages . Men are doing the same things they did when Homer smote his lyre or Hammurabi framed his laws . For example , in the Athens of antiquity there were pacifists and bitter-enders , profiteers and venal politicians ? everything , in fact , with which the great war has made us familiar . After twenty centuries of Christian influence , we do the same old things in the same old fashion , only on a more gigantic scale . This shadow fell over me to-day as I talked with a young French officer in my study . He used this terrible sentence with an air of sad finality : ' Ideals , my reverend friend , are at the mercy of the baser instincts . ' What faith it takes to sustain an ardent , impatient , forward-looking soul in a slow universe ! Keep facing it , ' said the old skipper to the young mate in Conrad 's Typhoon ; and ere we know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man . He did not know whether the ship would be lost or not ? nor do we . But lie kept facing the storm , taking time to be just to the coolies on board , much to the amazement of Jukes . He never lost hope ; and if he was an older man when he got through the storm , he at least sailed into tho harbor . November 11 . ? London went wild to-day . As a signal that the Armistice had been signed , the air-raid guns sounded , ? bringing back unhappy memories , ? but we knew that ' the desired , delayed , incredible time ' had arrived . The war has ended ; and humanity , on its knees , thanks God . Words were not made for such a time . They stammer , and falter , and fail . Whether to shout or weep , men did not know ; so we did both . Something not ourselves has made for righteousness and we are awed , subdued , m er. whelmed . The triumph seems wrought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts of joy are muffled by thoughts of the gay and gallant dead ; The rebound from the long repression was quick , the outburst startling . Men danced in the streets . The ? hugged and kissed and sobbed . Plain flew everywhere , flags of every color . Women wore dresses made of flags . Shops and factories emptied of their own accord . At an early hour a vast host gathered at the gates of Bucking . ham Palace , singing the national an . them . The King and Queen appeared on the balcony , and a mighty shout went up ? like the sound of many waters . St. Paul 's was jammed by noon ; the Abbey was packed . It melted the heart to hear them sing ? there was an echo of a sob in every song . All know that the secret of our joy is locked in the cold young hearts that sleep in Flan . ders , in eyes that see the sun no more , Never was the world so coerced by its dead . They command ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . No wonder ; the long strain , the bitter sorrow , the stern endurance had to find vent . At first , peace seemed as unreal as war . It took time to adjust the mind to the amazing reality , Even now it seems half a dream . There is little hate , only pity . The rush of events has been so rapid , so bewildering , that men are dazed . Down on the Embankment I saw two old men , walking annin-arm , one blind , the other half-blind , and both in rags . One played an old battered hand-organ , and the other sang in a cracked voice . They swayed to and fro , keeping time to the hymn , Our God , our hope in ages past . ' So it was from end to end of London . The gray old city seemed like a cathedral , its streets aisles , its throngs worshipers.
