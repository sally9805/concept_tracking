There is a saying in Washington that the U. S. policy toward Nicaragua is handled at the State Department by an office boy . There is a sharper saying , among anti-imperialists , that the office boy is in the pay of Wall Street . An emanation from the State Department last week on the subject of Nicaragua appeared to prove the truth of at least one of these sayings . <P> A year ago the State Department was requested by President Diaz of Nicaragua to send down an expert to survey Nicaragua 's finances . Nicaragua needed more money . U. S. bankers were wary of loaning more money to a country already requiring U. S. Marines to put it in order and thus safeguard present U. S. loans &; property . The State Department assigned the survey to Dr. William Wilson Cumberland , who was just through serving as U. S. financial dictator of Haiti . Dr. Cumberland went , saw and reported last March to Secretary Kellogg on the fiscal state of Nicaragua . President Diaz took his copy of the report to U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , the day after President-Elect Hoover sailed good-willfully towards Latin-America , the State Department for some reason resurrected the Cumberland report from its eight-month obscurity , and published it . It was seen that Dr. Cumberland had recommended : <P> That control of the Bank of Nicaragua be sold to U. S. bankers . <P> That the Bank of Nicaragua be authorized to borrow not more than $30,000,000 , beginning with a $12,000,000 loan to refund the present external debt and meet other immediate needs . <P> That the U. S. State Department nominate , and Nicaragua 's president appoint , a Collector-General and an Auditor-General for Nicaragua , both to be Americans , to safeguard the U. S. interests involved and ensure Nicaraguan stability . These officers " would be welcomed by the Nicaraguan people , " asserted Dr. Cumberland . <P> On sight of these terms , two outcries arose in the U. S. press . Dr. Cumberland 's was the most imperialistic scheme yet devised , said one outcry ; and what a blunder for the State Department to have published such a scheme just when Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea in Latin-America . <P> Secretary Kellogg , greatly agitated , stammered out two explanations . In the first place , he called attention to the fact that the Cumberland report was put out by the State Department only as " the personal views of Dr. Cumberland , " not as an official program . In the second place , he made the incredible announcement that the State Department had not known Mr. Hoover was going to visit Nicaragua . Secretary Kellogg added , vaguely , that there were some suggestions in the Cumberland report of which he did not approve . <P> It was at the White House that the episode ended . " **26;10546;TOOLONG " - that is , by the President himself at press conference-it was announced that the Cumberland plan would never do , that the Coolidge administration would not ( again ) undertake to supervise , safeguard or guarantee foreign loans made by its citizens , or to interfere in any way with another country 's fiscal freedom .                   @ @
