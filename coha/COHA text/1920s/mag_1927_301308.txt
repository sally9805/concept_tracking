Last year the French Opera Comique visited the U. S. and proved , for one thing , that light opera can not support itself in Manhattan without special assistance . <P> One of the patrons of the French Opera Comique last season was Paul E. Poitras ( brierwood importer ) .

Mencken . <P> Erik Huneker ( now in his 30 's ) is of quieter disposition . He has been connected with the musical world mainly through publicity departments , at one time working for the Metropolitan Opera Company . No berserk lion , he will nevertheless have ample opportunity to struggle with a big task . It is the purpose of Opera Comique , Inc. , so named in files of proposed corporations in Albany , to raise $6,800,000 by the sale of preferred and common stock . Special charter subscribers who take $4,000 worth of preferred will receive in perpetuity two seats to weekly performances . Charter subscribers who take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An option has already been taken on a site near Broadway in the 50 's .
