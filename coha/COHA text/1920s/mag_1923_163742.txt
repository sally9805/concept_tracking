Fall , to secure an oil concession for his company in Sakhalin . <P> Sometime ago Mr. Sinclair became interested in the possibilities of petroleum production in Sakhalin , and his representative , Mr. Templeton , has been in Moscow for months without being able to bring the matter to a head with the Soviet authorities . Meanwhile Japan wishes to buy northern Sakhalin for $75,000,000 from Russia , who demands $500,000 , 000 for it . While the Soviet envoy , Adolph A. Joffe , is deadlocked with the Japanese in Tokyo , the Soviet leaders in Moscow are apparently flirting with Sinclair in order to induce the Japanese to raise their bid . <P> If Northern Sakhalin is sold to Japan , Sinclair 's much-discussed oil concession there will of course be worthless . The whole episode would furnish a worthy theme for a novel by Oppenheim . Sinclair 's attempted penetration of the Russian oil fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Barnsdall Corporation , another American company .
