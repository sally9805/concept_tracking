But now the ranks are knitting  --  have knit . A solid party is forming , and the sound that goes up is ' no longer a wail , but a paean and a battle cry . The reasons for this sudden welding of elements shaken apart by the shock of the Chicago coup are numerous . usual , known to every one , and they can be affected not at all by anything the Democratic Convention may do or by any one the Democratic Convention may choose . They . are not reasons , in effect , but party reactions . But there are reasons , too , and reasoners , and these it is possible to reach and touch and win . Upon these Republican reasoners the Democratic attention must be focused if they wish to make converts dnd gain votes . The Republican reasoner : , want certain definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great body . of them want , with a consuming desire which dwarfs all party prejudice , the League of Nations , with reservations or without tlietn , and they doubt in their souls if Harding will give it to them . But they would rather gamble on a weak Republican than upon a weak Democrat . They want a strong man for President , a man who dares to lead , to fight , to make concessions , to surround himself with advisers who are ' his . peers or better . The Republicans have offered a candidate who seems to be such a man  --  but they have nominated him for Vice President .

They may prefer marking time ' to electing a man they can not control , simply keeping their organization intact and spending four years in girding themselves for 1924 . But nothing girds one for battle quite so well as victory . If the Democrats do want to win , there is one man who can win for them , John J.
