A poker player who usually wins and a pinkish liberal who earnestly omits tact is Columnist Heywood Broun . One day last week , the following announcement appeared in the New York World at the top of the space usually devoted to his column : <P> " The World has decided to dispense with the services of Heywood Broun . His disloyalty to this paper makes any further association impossible . " <P> Mr. Broun had done every sort of writing for the World except giving advice to the lovelorn . He had been reporter , book reviewer , theatre critic ( before he developed a phobia for the theatre ) , sports writer , columnist . His whims had upset the World routine ; but his stuff had a following . Last August , he came to a stalemate with Publisher Ralph Pulitzer of the World because he insisted on writing very , very pinkish words on the Sacco-Vanzetti case ( TIME , Aug. 22 ) . It was not until late in December that Mr. Broun 's column again appeared in the World . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( small but earnestly liberal weekly ) . <P> The immediate cause of the World 's dismissal of Mr. Broun was an article he wrote in The Nation last week . He discussed U. S. journalism , using the World as an example of how bad the best is : " The World on numerous occasions has been able to take two , three or even four different stands with precisely the same material in hand . So constant were the shifts during the Sacco-Vanzetti case that the paper seemed like an old car going up hill . In regard to Nicaragua the World has thundered on Thursdays and whispered on Monday mornings . Again and again the paper has managed to get a perfect full-nelson on some public problem only to let its opponent slip away because its fingers were too feeble . It does not seem to me that the paper possesses either courage or tenacity . . . . <P> Not so long ago a Sunday editor of the World ) insisted on editing a contribution to one of the newspaper columns . Somebody had written in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded all Scandinavians as dullwitted . ' Heywood , ' said the responsible editor , ' do n't you realize that our Swedish readers would be offended ? ' " <P> After the ousting , Mr. Broun issued a statement concluding : " ' Disloyalty , ' unexplained , might mean to the reader anything from robbing the till to sitting on Ralph Pulitzer 's hat . <P> " When I returned to the World after a witch 's Sabbatical , they told me I should blow off steam in The Nation . They told me there was no governor on that steam . Previously the World maintained its right to censor what I wrote for them . Now it wants to censor what I write elsewhere . After the tradition of Uncle Tom , I can still say that , while my body may have belonged to the Press Publishing Company , my soul belonged to God . "
