It was at the end of a year in the flood tide of science that the American Association for the Advancement of Science held its annual meeting last week in Philadelphia . It had been the year in which : <P> Experimenters in Belgium , Germany and California had failed to corroborate the ether drift findings of Dr. Miller of Cleveland , thus tending to substantiate the Einstein theory of time-space relativity . <P> Dr. Millikan of California had verified the existence of cosmic rays of great penetration , Dr. Kolhoerster of Germany tracing their source to the constellations Orion , Hercules and Andromeda , where new stars are forming . <P> Dr. Michelson of Chicago had remeasured the speed of light , setting it at 186,284 mi. per sec . <P> Dr. Keeson of Holland had solidified helium . <P> Dr. Hopkins of Illinois had isolated a new chemical element , No. 61 in Mendeleev 's table , and named it Illinium . <P> Dr. Sumner of Manhattan had isolated the first enzyme . <P> Dr. Coolidge of Schenectady had produced powerful cathode rays outside a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hydrogen-hydrogen welding flame , the hottest ever ; another colleague , Dr. Alexanderson , had nearly perfected radio television . <P> Mars had come closer to Earth than it would be for another 13 years . <P> There had been a total solar eclipse , new comets , unusual sunspots and the only perfect lunar appulse in four centuries . <P> Dr. Streeter of Washington had studied the youngest human embryo yet available ( eleven days ) . <P> A European fly taken to New England to fight two insect pests had proved itself the enemy of 92 other insects . <P> Tetraethyl lead ( antiknock ) gasoline had been declared safe for general use and been put on sale throughout the country . <P> The National Academy of Sciences , with aid from college presidents , foundations , manufacturers and Secretary Hoover , had launched a campaign for 20 millions to devote to independent scientific research . <P> These and many more events of 1926 were in the minds of scientific gentlemen who thronged , about 1,000 strong , in 15 sections and 43 allied societies , to Drexel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Idvorsky Pupin , onetime Serbian shepherd , now oft-honored electro-physicist of Columbia University , greeted them with poetic discourse upon the progress of electrical communication , beginning with James Clerk Maxwell 's monograph on magnetism in 1873 and Heinrich Rudolf Hertz 's experiments with pulsations in the ether in 1889 , through Marconi 's practical application of Hertz 's discoveries , to modern radio and radiotelephony . Himself the author of great advances in electrical communication , Dr. Pupin predicted the ultimate translation of cosmic messages from the surrounding universe , especially those emissions of the sun which are now looked upon as nuisances to earthly radio since they cause " static " and " fading . " <P> The scientists ( and many a layman , for the meetings were public ) attended further discourses , papers , demonstrations , including :
