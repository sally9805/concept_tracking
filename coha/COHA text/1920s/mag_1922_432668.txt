IliELAND has always had two heads ? one in Ulster and the other in the youth ; but to-day there is a Janus-headed nation of Sinn Feiners . Why should a little country like Ireland have so many heads ? Last summer , when the fate of Ireland and the peace of the British Empire hung by a thread , three travelers from three corners of the earth arrived in London . From South Africa came Premier . Jan Smuts , a delegate to the Imperial Conference ; from New York , llartin H. Glynn , former governor and one of the silent leaders of the Irish campaign in the United States ; while from the Antipodes , via Rome , came Archbishop Mannix of Australia . Although Smuts and Glynn did not meet , they laid the foundation for the peace conference between the British Cabinet and official representatives of the Dail Eireann , which created the Irish Fret State . How and why did they succeed when there had been so many previous failures ? Why , after Ireland had obtained a republic in everything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among themselves ? In two earlier papers I have related the checkered course of the peace negotiations in 1920 and the early months of 1921 , strewn with the wreckage of good intentions and hard work . There had been many stumbling-blocks in the way of a reconciliation , the most im- portant being the unconquered determination of the Irish in the United States ' to see it through ' ; the blunt refusal of Mr. Lloyd George to recognize De Valera , Griffith , and Collins as representatives of the de facto Irish Parliament ; Ulster 's burning passion for self-government ; and , finally , Collins 's cool , calculating confidence in an Irish victory . In mid-April , 1921 , the British Prime Minister issued to the Irish ' Extremists ' his ultimatum , based upon Collins 's uncompromising declaration in an interview with me , in which he declared : When I saw you before , I said that the same effort which would get us dominion home rule would get us a republic , and I am still of that opinion .

' This was the situation in England and Ireland on the eve of my last journey from London to Dublin prior to the peace conference . It is no exaggeration to say that the British Empire was never in greater danger than it is to-day the Liberal Manchester Guardian wrote . If you picture the flames We are lighting , or those that Irishmen are lighting , you will realize that the status of Ireland places us as a governing power in a category in which no apologies can help us .

' We don't. want a united Ireland , ' they were shouting in Belfast ; ' we want a United Kingdom . ' The British Government will let us down to-morrow if they think they can get anything out of it , ' Sir James Craig , the Ulster Prime Minister , was warning Orangemen . At a big political rally , an old Belfast laborer evoked applause by saying bluntly , ' We want no more meetings with De Valera , and we ' 11 have no more . We can not go further at present with the assassins and murderers of the loyal people of Ireland .

Returning to Dublin during the Reign of Terror which preceded the peace conference , I learned that all my Sinn Fein friends were in prison or ' on the run . ' At the homes and schools where , on former visits , I had left messages for them , so that they could arrange to communicate with me ' when the coast was clear , ' the servants replied that Griffith was in Mountjoy jail ; that De Valera was ' away ' ; that Collins had not been in Dublin , and they did not know where Fitzgerald , Brennan , or Childers could be found . Even Mrs. J. R. Green , widow of the historian and ' Grandmother of the Rebellion , ' whose spacious Georgian house in St. Stephen 's Green was the ter . urinal of the Sinn Fein ' underground railway , ' was not in ! That night I met the members of the American Commission for Relief in Ireland ? young men who had been sent from the United States to investigate reports of starvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first intervention ' of any American organization , it created a week-end tempest in British official circles . The British condemnation of America 's mixing in ' in the Irish question was in sharp contrast to the joy of the Irish leaders and people . At this time nine tenths of the Sinn Feiners believed that it was only a matter of weeks before the American army and navy would he fighting on the side of Ireland . Soma one had had lithographs printed in New York , for distribution in Ireland , of the first Irish battleship , ' the Emerald Isle . It was an imposing poster of a giant warship , painted green , with the name in gold letters on the bow . This was to have been used im Ireland to advertise the Irish ' navy ' !

After the long and expensive came paign in America , De Valera and the Dail sent Dr. McCartain to Soviet Russia , where he arrived on March 10 , 1921 , to negotiate a treaty , ask for recognition , and obtain ammunition and commercial rights . Only a few weeks before , Scotland Yard obtained copies of secret Sinn Fein correspond- IRELAND FROM A SCOTLAND YARD NOTEBOOK sox race with Irish leaders in the United States , showing that many Irishmen here as well as in Ireland believed that the United States would soon be at war over Ireland 's freedom . The first time I discussed this question with Griffith and Collins , they were convinced , ' from their reports front De Valera , ' that American intervention was imminent ; and when the Commission for Relief began its difficult task , they considered it the first step toward official cooperation . Whenever I talked with the Irish leaders , they were hopeful of American aid . 1t this time Griffith , Collins , Mulcahy , Barton , and Fitzgerald had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had not the Dail Eireann , at his request , appropriated $1,500,000 for the campaign in the United States , prior to the Presidential election , for t he purpose of obtaining this assistance ? Ilad not Scotland Yard intercepted correspondence from De Valera , when he was still in New York , reporting on the political preparations which he was making for the recognition of Ireland and all that that embodied ? Had not the Irish leaders in America split on this very question , even before De Valera returned to his native heath ? In the United States , as in Ireland , there was the Janus-headed leadership of the Irish cause . This was the situation which complicated the ' Irish question . ' Ireland 's fight was as dangerous a political issue in the United States as in England ; and the appearance of the American commission had buoyed the hopes of the Irish as it had crystallized the fears of the British . Before coming to Dublin , I had lunched at the United Service Club in London with officials of the War Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing the British military campaign in Ireland were debated with great earnestness . The Government was finding it . increasingly hard to obtain funds from t he Imperial Exchequer ; and when it was reported that the American Commission expected to raise ten million dollars for relief , the British had visions of this money finding its stay into the hands of Sinn Fein and prolonging their ability to hold out . ' Without questioning the intentions of the Americans , they cited one of the financial tricks of Sinn Fein which had caused no end of distress . In Dublin one day word was passed to the Sinn Feiners to withdraw their money from the local branch of an Ulster Bank . As fast as the depositors withdrew , they deposited their money in the Royal Postal Savings Bank at the General Post . Office ; and as it came in , the Postmaster took it around and redeposited it in a Sinn Fein bank ! Under these conditions , the British asked , what would happen to ten million dollars from the United States ? The United Stales was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . British officials , including Sir Hamar Greenwood , General Macready , Sir Basil Thomson , and Philip Kerr , were pricked too often by the thorns of American criticism to forget the influence of American opinion in Irish circles . De Valera , Griffith , Collins , and Fitzgerald , while admitting the value of assistance from across the Atlantic , were staunch supporters of the ideal that the Dhil Eireann was supreme over all Irishmen , here , there , and everywhere . Being convinced , personally , that there were three parties to the Irish question , and that there could not be a settlement between the British Cabinet and the Dhil without the support of the Irish in the United States , I urged a meeting of the three principals , in the hope that out of such a conference peace could be made . Up to this time , however , there had been few influential American friends of Ireland in England , and no opportunity for an exchange of views . In the hope that the American Commission might serve that purpose , I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission was considered too partial . The very fact that it was cooperating with the Irish White Cross was sufficient to veto the suggestion . Was not Michael Collins , the arch-leader of the ' Extremists , ' one of the directors ? Thus the British retorted , never losing an opportunity of emphasizing the division among Sim ? Feiners ; but the schism in Sinn Fein was elastic . At that time Griffith and Collins were held the leaders of the Irish die-bards . ' To-day they are the staunchest supporters of the treaty ; and DeValera , whom Lloyd George considered the apostle of conciliation , is the champion of the militarists . Why ? We need not probe deep for the root cause . Griffith and Collins , while ' Extremists , ' were practical politicians . De Valera was the dreamer and promiser . He led them to expect American intervention . When it came , finally , only in the form of relief , they began to lose confidence in his reports . Furthermore , they were in intimate touch with the Irish people . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being circulated among the women that children were being born insane because of the reign of terror . Griffith and his associates and De Valera and his followers , despite their differences , maintained a solid front from this day to the final peace conference , because of their mutual hatred and suspicion of England . The fundamental difference , however , between the two factions was and is the same . The one hates Britain more than it loves Ireland , and the other is so much more devoted to Ireland that the spirit of hate is secondary . This is what divides Sinn Fein and snakes it to-day a Janus-headed party . When Griffith and Collins discovered that they could obtain everything they had been fighting for under another name , they accepted the Free State and fought for it . De Valera insisted upon the label . In this way the ' Extremists ' became ' Moderates ' and tried to save Ireland , while the ' Moderates ' became uncompromising rebels and brought Ireland to the verge of civil war , justifying the pessimistic predictions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and Ireland , the Irish would fight among themselves . But , as an Irish woman , who acted as a confidential messenger for Collins and Griffith , remarked one day , ' Ireland smiles behind her tears . ' There have been many black days in Ireland 's fight for freedom , but none so dark as those which preceded the peace conference in Downing Street last summer . Continuing my search for Sinn Fein friends , after failing to bring the British into a conference with Americans through the American Commission , I encountered , in the streets of Dublin , where a British patrol had just passed , Robert Brennan , Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and a member of the Dail . He was on his way to the ' President 's ' with the morning mail . Scotland Yard and Dublin Castle had been hunting him for months ; but here he was , alone and free ! Think what the British would have given to seize Vim with his priceless mail-pouch ! I told him what and whom I wanted . This unexpected meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications with all the leaders of Sinn Fein . Being in a prison camp , Fitzgerald IRELAND FROM A SCOTLAND YARD NOTEBOOK 805 was under General Macready 's jurisdictions . I hurried a jaunting-car driver to the British Headquarters at Parkgate , and asked for permission to interview Fitzgerald . Sir Nevil Macready , who had assisted me on previous occasions , dictated a letter which unlocked the gates of the camp , and within an hour Fitzgerald was brought to the conference room , the door was closed , and for the first time in months he was free to talk and smoke and ask questions . As I always put my ' cards ' on the table while conversing with both parties , I told Fitzgerald what I believed to be the situation in England , and expressed the belief that there could be a settlement on the original terms of Irish control of Irish affairs , including everything from finance to an army , if Sinn Fein would waive the demand for a republic . Sinn Fein , Fitzgerald replied , would not give up the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession to England , so long as Lloyd George maintained his policy of attempting to split Southern Ireland , so long as British troops remained in Ireland ; and that , until the Prime Minister publicly agreed to negotiate with the DU Eireann , without exacting any conditions or promises , there would be no possibility of peace . Ireland was defending herself from aggression of a ' foreign enemy . ' When that aggression ceased , Ireland would be independent and free ! That was his message ! That was the attitude of Sinn Fein . It was the sentiment of Ireland ! Before Fitzgerald was taken back to his cell , he gave me a note to Collins and a secret address where he could be found . As I was leaving , the prison commander asked me to luncheon . Such was the irony of life in Ireland in 1021 . I could interview Sims Feiners , dine with British officials the same day , and leave a military prison with the address of an Irish leader whom the British would have given a king 's ransom for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a murderer 's paradise and the hangman 's stage . Through the vigilance of the Blackand-Tans , members of the Irish Republican Army were tracked to their hiding-places and arrested . Ambushes were daily occurrences , and the captives were considered assassins . Those who were found guilty , and whose cases were given every possible judicial consideration , were sentenced to be hanged . Before the executions , thousands of women and children would march through the main thoroughfares of Dublin to the prison walls , kneel , pray , and chant the rosary , while the hangings were taking place inside . This black-clad throng would remain outside the jail until the guard appeared with a small typed piece of paper , which he would post on the gages , announcing the name of the lad whose life had been snuffed out on the scaffold . For long hours afterwards hundreds of women would remain at the prison gates , praying and gossiping . During every rebellion , as in every war , there are sown , with the seeds of patriotism , the seeds of disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proved to-day . While the inhabitants of Southern Ireland were fighting for their freedom from Great Britain , a phrase that an Irish editor used , ' Killing is not murder , ' was generally accepted as a political motto . To kill a British official was not considered murder ; and , as a natural consequence , scores of men and women were killed to satisfy personal grudges . Sinn Feiners themselves suffered ; but as there was little semblance of law and order , 806 IRELAND FROM A SCOTLAND YARD NOTEBOOK it was possible to kill and escape all the consequences . The murder campaign spread like wildfire , and the murders which occur so frequently even to-day , in Ulster as well as in the South , are but evidences that the fire of the rebellion had not been extinguished by the peace treaty . When we look at Europe 's struggles since the Armistice , and witness the desperate efforts that the nations and people are spending to restore normalcy , ' we should not he surprised if in Ireland some lawlessness remains for many months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be made : it must evolve as time moulds a new public opinion and tuitional consciousness . As De Valera and Collins were in hiding , I had to await an opportune moment to see them . A majority of their ministerial associates were already in prison , and the British were saying that the Mil could meet now at any time behind the bars , as there would be a quorum present ! While awaiting messages from Do Valera and Collins , the two officials who , as President and Minister of Finance , respectively , of the Irish Republic , shared with Austin Stack and Richard Mulcahy the burdens of the de facto government , I went to Dublin Castle and General Headquarters , to urge permission to interview Griffith . Sir John Anderson was at the time acting for the Chief Secretary who was in London . General Boyd , the youngest general in the British army and the most popular officer in Ireland , was in command of the Dublin district . As they alone could issue a. pass to Mountjoy , I explained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I expected to see Collins , but that the success of this meeting depended upon how free I was from surveillance . Should they grant me freedom of action in prison and without , I would have the basic peace-terms of Sinn Fein to place before Sir Basil Thomson of Scotland Yard , and the Cabinet . They were more than willing to cooperate . Sir . John went so far as to acquaint me with the latest reports from London , in order that they might he laid before the Sinn Fein ministers , Leaving the courtyard of that great British stronghold in Ireland , with the ' key ' to Mountjoy , which Sir John had given in the form of a letter to the superintendent , I passed a . Black-and-Tan patrol which was being armed and equipped for a raid , , jumped aboard one of the high jaunting-ears , and rode from Dublin Castle to the old prison where the cells and corridors were packed with ' rebels . ' The narrow street leading to the main entrance of Mountjoy was blocked by a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing with a poor , hysterical creature who was demanding permission to see her only son . The guardsman let me inside the wall and closed the solid iron gates with a bang ? the only sound that broke the monotony of muffled prayers . The courtyard between the brick wall and the main buildings was covered with a tangled mass of barbed wire . Through this was a narrow passage guarded by Tommies in field uniform . It had been several months since I had last interviewed the man who acted as President of Sinn Fein during Mr. De Yalera 's long stay in America . Then he was the guest in one of the century-old mansions of Dublin . Today he was in prison . Dublin that day was blanketed with mist , and the prison was damp and dark . The superintendent sent my card to Griffith and invited me to his private office where a soft-coal fire was smouldering and a gas-light burning . Heaped upon a long table were several thousand letters to prisoners , which had been censored and confis- eated . Adjusting his monocle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any idea how Griffith had smuggled a statement to the press two clays before . How any Sinn Feiner in his prison could communicate with the outside world through barbed-wire entanglements and a high wall , when he was not permitted to have any visitors , was beyond his comprehension . As I could throw no light on that , he was curious about the influence I had to get into Mount Joy when everyone else was excluded . Some things the Government did , he said , were , ' by Jove , unexplainable ! ' It seemed an endless wait for Griffith . I was expressing a doubt about his willingness to be interviewed , when the door was thrown open and the guard stepped in , announcing prisoner No . ? . The founder of the Sinn Fein movement entered cautiously , looked coldly at the superintendent , who was leaning against the white-marble mantel . As he stood near the door , studying the situation , I could not believe that prison life could make such a change in any man . He had not shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gold-rimmed spectacles rested unevenly on the bridge ' of his nose , his clothing and shoes adding to the general appearance of a man who is down and out . I greeted him as warmly as I could , thanking him for coming ; but he was obviously not glad to see me . Why should I be favored above his relatives and friends , unless I was serving some motive of Lloyd George ? When the superintendent and guard left , we sat before the tire . Griffith could not believe that we were alone . Guards had been dogging him day and night . Now there was not a uniform in sight , and doors and windows were closed . He was reserved and cautious while I told him of my activities during the past three months . I added that , although I had no proposals this time , I believed peace could be made on almost any terms if Sims Fein would accept the status of a free state within the British Commonwealth of Nations ; and I recalled the terms which Collins , De Valera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republic . ' I concluded by telling him whom I had seen in Dublin . Griffith listened with great patience and restraint . Then he spoke of the routine of life in jail ; of the terrible strain of bidding good-bye to his fellow prisoners as they were led away to be executed ; of the prayers , songs , and cries of the women outside ? all due to the presence of an enemy army of occupation . ' Remove the Crown forces , and Ireland would be free , peaceful and happy ; but so long as the army remained , the Irish Republic would thrive under persecution . Griffith did not believe Lloyd George was , or would be , sincere . He had no confidence in anything lie promised . Griffith 's terms to-day were the same as they had always been . ' It is inconceivable that a free Ireland can interfere with any of the rights of a free England . ' That was the platform , formulated by Collins , approved by De Valera , upon which they all stood . Peace ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure of his campaign of reprisals and aggression , by inviting the Dail Eireann to a conference . That was Mr. Griffith 's message . The initiative rested with the Prime Minister . Before the interview ended , I had convinced him that my only interest in seeking conversations with both the British and Irish was to learn the possibilities of a settlement ; and as we parted , he gave me messages to his colleagues , which enabled me later to write a symposium expressing the fundamental terms of peace . 808 IRELAND FROM A SCOTLAND YARD NOTEBOOK IV There was always great mystery about Mick ' Collins and ' Dick ' Mulcahy , the commander and the chief of staff , respectively , of the Republican army . All that the military officials knew about them was learned from their correspondence and orders , which were captured here and there in Ireland . Mulcahy was considered by the British a military genius . General Boyd told me one day to tell Mulcahy that , if he wished to join the British army , he could make him his chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing forces than anyone he knew . On my return to the hotel , after interviewing Griffith , I received one of Collins 's typically mysterious messages . A courier would meet me at three o'clock , and I was to follow her instructions ? which I did . After a wild ride about Dublin in a taxicab for nearly an hour , I was ordered to enter a deserted house within a stone 's throw of the hotel . Here I met Collins , who smiled and said that he might have come to the hotel to see me , but he thought I would enjoy a drive ! And , of course , the place at which we met was not the address given by Fitzgerald ! After an hour 's conversation , the kernel of Collins 's message was this : If Mr. Lloyd George wishes to make peace , all he has to do is to invite the Dail to send an official and representative delegation of Irishmen to a peace conference . With these messages I left Kingstown on the night mail-boat for England , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been communicated to me by Major Erskine Childers , who was , and still is , De Valera 's confidential adviser . Interviews in London the following days with Lord Derby , Sir Hamar Greenwood , and his associate Sir John Anderson , at the Irish Office , Sir Basil Thomson at Scotland Yard , and Philip Kerr at No. 10 Downing Street , furnished the climax to my investigations . The Earl of Derby , who was so dkturbed over Irish propaganda in France , where he had served as British Ambassador , had gone to Ireland on a mission of his own , and returned convinced that the ' greatest service ' he could render his country was to assist in an Irish settlement . He had concluded , after talks with Lloyd George , De Valera , and others , that , if Craig and De Valera would hold another conference and agree to a programme for all of Ireland , England would accept the joint proposals . As Lord Derby knew that I had paved the way for the first meeting between the leaders of Ulster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland again , and invite the two men to meet at his house in Liverpool or Paris , and draw up a proposal to the Prime Minister . Greenwood said that the government 's policy now was peace and settlement , ' He emphasized the importance of the appointment of a Catholic viceroy ? Viscount FitzAlan , who belonged to the oldest Roman Catholic family in written history . ' Anal her Catholic will be appointed Chief Justice of Ulster , ' he added , ' to show there is no religious bigotry among British officials . ' Greenwood asked whether Collins would agree to a settlement within the Empire . Sir John remarked that he , personally , had never agreed with the government policy of singling out Collins as a murderer , ' for now it was evident that the British would have to talk peace with him , if they were to have any conference at all . As these were the views of responsible British statesmen , I went to Downing Street and Scotland Yard , to learn the Prime Minister 's attitude . One of IRELAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Derby a ' stuffed shirt , ' and said , ' For God 's sake do n't give the Sinn Feiners the impression that Lord Derby speaks for the P. M. ' The net result of all the conversations was the same : no one knew what Mr. Lloyd George would do , but evidently he was not yet convinced that the initiative lay in his hands . He was still playing his lone hand , offering peace to the ' Moderates , ' while denouncing the ' Extremists . ' So far as anyone knew , at this time he had no intention of inviting official representatives of Sinn Fein and the Dhil Eireann to discuss the terms of a settlement with the British Government . In brief , Mr. Lloyd George 's Irish education was not yet complete ! The ' war ' would have to continue until the Irish asked for peace ! V At the Gaiety Theatre , May 0 , as I was leaving the stalls , I recognized in the audience a man whom I had not seen for several years . I pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Glynn , of Albany , former governor , newspaper editor , the man who delivered the famous oration in St. Louis , and who gave the Democratic party the slogan , ' He kept us out of war , ' which reelected Woodrow Wilson in 1916 . Ile accepted my invitation to the American Club for the following day , and at that meeting , which lasted nearly three hours , I told him of the experience I had had in Ireland and London , while he related the results of his work in America and his meetings in Rome with Archbishops Mannix and Hayes , and high officials of the Vatican . He spoke of the plans for a great boycott of British goods in the United States , of the difficulty of concluding peace on the basis of a free Ireland unless Ireland were a republic , because the idea of a republic was gaining strength every day throughout the world . We debated the attitude of the Vatican , the attempts which had been made to persuade the Pope to intervene , and to - urge the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Dominion-Home-Rule plan , with whatever modifications were necessary to ensure a settlement within the Empire . ' I do not believe the Vatican can be drawn into this dispute , ' said Governor Glynn . While discussing the attitude of the Irish in the United States , I spoke of the conversations I had had with the Irish leaders , and of the number of times the American correspondents had told the members of the Dail that the United States would not intervene . I added that former Secretary of State Colby had told me that ' neither Wilson nor the Harding administration would interfere in Anglo-Irish affairs . ' Although I had no authority to do so , I asked Mr. Glynn whether he would meet Mr. Lloyd George and talk as frankly to him as he had to me , if the Prime Minister could be persuaded to receive him . Mr. Glynn replied that , while he was working for no conference with the chief of state on Irish affairs , as an American citizen traveling through London , he should be glad to meet him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Scotland Yard and Downing Street . Sir Basil Thomson was enthusiastic over the suggestion that Lloyd George and Glynn get together . Philip Kerr acted as the spokesman to the Prime Minister , who was attending sessions of the Allied Supreme Council , then meeting in London . At five o'clock in the evening of May 4 , I was in Sir Basil 's office when Kerr telephoned that the Premier could not see Governor Glynn , because the Govern- ment had invited De Valera , before , to come to London and he had refused . Mr. Lloyd George did not wish to repeat the invitation . Kerr was sorry , but that closed the incident . Although temporarily blocked , Sir Basil had no intention of giving up . He had tried for more than a year to convince the Cabinet that peace could be made only with the Sinn Feb officials , and through or with the consent of the Irish in the United States . Here was an opportunity for Lloyd George to ' get down to business . ' At Sir Basil 's suggestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting reasons why lie should reconsider his decision , and hurried with it over to Downing Street . It was seven o'clock by the time I reached Kerr 's office . I told him what had been clone , handed him the letter , which he promised to show the P. M. ' that night , and left for my office to write a dispatch , as guardedly as possible , giving the latest developments in the Irish situation . Early next morning , Kerr telephoned that Governor Glynn would be given a ticket to the - House of Commons for that afternoon , and that he was asked to wait in the distinguished strangers ' gallery until Kerr called for him . Mr. Lloyd George intended to speak , and when he had finished , Kerr thought there might be an opportunity to bring the two men together without raising a diplomatic point as to whether or not the interview had been insight by either . Glynn wished to meet Lloyd George as an equal , not as one asking a favor or expecting one ; while the Prime Minister did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview with the American editor . Kerr , being an experienced diplomat , was so successful that the conversation , which was expected to be brief and formal , continued for nearly three hours . This interview was one of two really decisive interviews throughout the secret negotiations of 1021 . Governor Glynn impressed upon the Prime Minister the seriousness and earnestness of the Irish , the power of the Irish movement in America , the importance of an Anglo-Irish peace as the basis for an Anglo-American understanding . Between sips of tea and puffs of cigars , they debated an Irish settlement , Lloyd George , as the head of a great government and Glynn as the advocate of Ireland , with the result that the Premier asked Mr. Glynn to convey an invitation to Mr. De Valera to come to London for a conference , adding that lie ' made no stipulations and expected no promises . " When Mr. Dc Valera nail I meet , ' the Prime Minister said in substance , ' he will demand a republic . I will answer that it is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' As Governor Glynn had to return to the United States at once , he asked me to carry the invitation to Mr. De Valera ; but as I had to leave for Paris , Mr. John McH . Stuart , another London correspondent , was entrusted with the historic invitation to the ' President of the Irish Republic . ' Other offers I have received , ' said De Valera , ' but none so propitious as this . ' On the other hand , both Mr. Kerr and Sir Basil Thomson said that the Prime Minister had expressed himself as being more satisfied , after his talk with Glynn , that peace with Ireland was possible , than he had ever been during the years in which he had carried the responsibility for the Irish policy of the British Government . During the succeeding days I made strenuous efforts to have the British Government lift the ban on the movements of Archbishop Mannix , so as to permit him to visit Ireland . Someone was needed to convince the Irish Republican leaders that this was their opportunity , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YARD NOTEBOOK 811 to enter into a conference as official representatives of Dail Eireann . I had many conversations with the archbishop , whose addresses in the United States , only a few months before , had kindled fires of indignation throughout two hemispheres . Although hitherto one of the most uncompromising of Republicans , he believed that the Sinn Fein leaders should negotiate . I pleaded with Scotland Yard and Downing Street , until the matter was finally taken up by the Cabinet . The Viceroy , Viscount FitzAlan , was asked to make inquiries in Ireland as to whether the archbishop would be welcome ; but word came on the eve of his departure from Australia , that his fellow churchmen in Ireland did not wish him to come over ! VI Can Governor Glynn deliver the goods ? ' This was the British Government 's query , in substance . Mr. Lloyd George had stated repeatedly that he wanted to deal with a representative of Sinn Fein who could get results . At the time of the interview between Lloyd George and Glynn , the Prime Minister had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yard that Mr. Dc Valera had cabled to the United States , and had asked the Sinn Fein leaders there whether he should make peace . The reply had not yet come . What would be the effect of Glynn 's recommendations in Dublin and New York ? Peace rested for the time being in his hands . Until he received Glynn 's message , De Valera was uncertain about the Irish in America . To learn their views , he sent a secret letter to the diplomatic agent of Sims Fein in Paris , requesting him to cable to a private code address in Philadelphia a business telegram which he enclosed . A copy of this let ter reached Scotland Yard . Attempts were made to interpret it . Mr. De Valera stated that the firm ' needed a million dollars to ' carry on ' under the present management . ' He asked whether there should be a change in the board of directors . ' The cable itself bore no evidence of politics or peace , as it was signed Godfather . ' The American , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' This made it easy for Scotland Yard ; and for five days the British Secret Service watched every message consigned to that address . He Valera 's letter , with Scotland Yard 's interpretation , was placed before the Prime Minister . Sir Basil Thomson believed that in this cable De Valera was informing his Irish associates in the United States that one million dollars was needed to carry on the war , and that , if the Americans cabled that the ' board of directors ' was to be changed , it meant that De Valera was to make peace . The fatal reply came on March 14 . The Philadelphian had sent it to Montreal , to be dispatched to Ireland . The cable was signed Daddy , ' and in the form of a business message it said that only twenty thousand pounds were available immediately , and added that ' a change in the board of directors now will wreck the firm . Carry on with present officials . ' Scotland Yard interpreted this to mean that the Irish in the United States did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same conclusion , and all confidential British advices from Ireland indicated that the peace movement would collapse . It was in this way that the decision shifted from London to Dublin , and here it remained until the third pilgrim whom I mentioned at the beginning of this paper arrived in England from South Africa . 812 IRELAND FROM A SCOTLAND YARD NOTEBOOK The whole world knows the story of events , from the day when General Smuts made his first journey to Ireland until the peace treaty was finally signed . With two exceptions , these negotiations are already a matter of history , and no attempt will be made now to review them . Suffice it to add that Mr. Glynn was the first to convince Mr. Lloyd George , and General Smuts was the peacemaker who persuaded De Valera and Collins . Upon the foundation of secret interviews and meetings which had extended over more than fifteen months , these two men built the skeleton structure for the Irish Free State . Both continued their good work , ? Governor Glynn in the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result that the final treaty met with the approval of the whole world , until De Valera bolted his own party . The secret history would not be complete , however , without further reference to the patient efforts of John S. Steele , another American correspondent . He was in Dublin during that crisis which came on the eve of the truce between the British Army and the I.R.A . Patrick Moylett , a business man of Galway , and a Sims Fein friend of Steele 's , joined hands with him when he negotiated the final truce with A. W. Cope , Assistant Under-Secretary in Dublin Castle . Thus , throughout the entire period of negotiations which brought about the Irish Free State , American correspondents and other American citizens were bringing the enemies of seven tragic centuries together . And Michael Collins , the hero of the Irish rebellion , whom the British would have executed two years ago , lived to act as one of the leading Irish plenipotentiaries . Throughout the negotiations with the British Cabinet , he sat at the table as an equal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago forgave , Mr. Lloyd George 's repeated denunciation of him as a ' gunman . ' When the London conferences ended , and the Irish delegates left the conference room in Downing Street , Collins walked over to a corner where there was an American rifle , the first manufactured in the United States for the World War , presented to Mr. Lloyd George by President Wilson . This he picked up , while the Cabinet watched in amazement . Walking over to Mr. Lloyd George 's chair , he sat down and said to the ministers : ' Now , the Prime Minister can take a photograph of a gunman ! ' Afterwards , for the first time during the long conference , the British and Irish statesmen shook hands ! Peace had been signed . When I went to England early in 1920 , I met in Sir William Tyrrell 's office , in else Foreign Office , a British civil servant , Mr. C. J. Philips , Lord Curzon 's chief assistant in Irish affairs , who predicted that ' within three years Ireland will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the British troops will be out of Ireland . ' It was a bold prophecy , but to-day it is fulfilled . Ireland is a republic in everything but name . She may still he Janus-headed , but as the slow forces of economic life bring the North and South together , and as a new national consciousness evolves in the South , Ireland will become a compact , industrious nation , united in peace as she was in war .
