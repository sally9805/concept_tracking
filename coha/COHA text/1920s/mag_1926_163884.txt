Spattering flurries of lead flying through city streets in war-time would constitute an obvious menace to public health . But what if in peacetime city streets were filled with clouds of lead , not bullets , but fine powdery particles mixed in with the whirling gutter-dust , lead deposited by the exhaust-pipes of motors burning gasoline treated with tetraethyl lead ( 1:1,500 ) to eliminate motor " knocking " ? Would that constitute a health menace ? <P> Some months ago , when five handlers of tetraethyl lead employed by the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey , went raving mad and died in straitjackets ( TIME , Nov. 10 , 1924 , SCIENCE ) , the health menace in manufacturing " ethyl gasoline " was recognized . The plant was shut down ; the sale of the new gasoline was discontinued . Health authorities investigated also the dangers of handling the fuel and the dangers of encountering exhaust fumes from motors . <P> These investigators reported that all was well . Care would have to be taken in handling the potent tetraethyl lead , but garage workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pittsburgh on animals had shown that the deposition of lead from an ethyl gas exhaust was very small . <P> But scientists at Yale , Harvard and Columbia were far from satisfied . " Inconclusive , premature , " they called the Pittsburgh tests ( TIME , May 11 ) . So U. S. Surgeon General Hugh S. Gumming called a conference of manufacturers , scientists and health officers , the sense of which was that a thoroughgoing reinvestigation should be made . Dr. Gumming appointed a committee : Professor W. H. Howell of Johns Hopkins , chairman , and Drs . Julius Stieglitz ( University of Chicago ) , Reid Hunt and David L. Edsall ( Harvard University ) , C.E. A. Winslow ( Yale University ) , W. S. Leathers ( Vanderbilt University ) and Albert J. Chesley ( Minneapolis ) . <P> Last week this committee reported . It had examined 252 persons , both exposed and not exposed to leaded gasoline and its combusted fumes . Blood , fecal and muscular tests had been made , and a variety of clinical methods had been employed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The findings were : No decisive indication of lead poisoning among chauffeurs or garage workers where leaded gasoline had been used for two or three years . Hence , no public menace in permitting the use and sale of leaded gasoline , providing four precautions are taken : <P> 1 ) The blending of the fuel- tetraethyl lead with gasoline-should be confined to as few central plants as possible . <P> 2 ) The leaded gasoline should be colored , to distinguish it from plain gasoline and warn people not to use it for cleaning clothes , washing hands , etc . <P> 3 ) Signs should be placed at filling stations warning customers that leaded gasoline is for use only in motor cars . <P> 4 ) Study of the effects of leaded gasoline ( and of carbon monoxide hazards in garages ) should be continued , lest chronic degenerative diseases of unobvious character be setting in slowly . <P> Having no authority to set down or enforce regulations for distributing and handling gasoline , Surgeon General Gumming announced that ha would call a conference of health officials from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chief manufacturer of the new fuel , promised to cooperate upon resuming its sales .
