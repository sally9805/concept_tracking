txt Efforts emanating from a conference held in Washington on Saturday to induce New York exporters and manufacturers to bring pressure on the United States Government to issue licenses for trade with Soviet Russia , on the ground that the trade will otherwise fall into the hands of European countries , did not seem likely to attain great success , according to opinions gathered here yesterday . . The niovement , it was learned , is sPonsored chiefly by Emerson P. Jennings , President of the Lehigh Machine . Coinpany of Lehighton , Pa. , which has a contract for a huge order of printing presses to be sent 1:o Soviet Russia : - and is unable to get them there under present conditions . Inquiries further disclosed that Saturday 's Washington conference ; which was not attended by . reporters , and which came to public notice onry when its organizers told as much as they wished to have known about what happened there , was by ? no means unanimous in its desire to demand the right to trade with Soviet Russia under the present political control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. E. Pratt &; Co .. former Chief of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce , whose name was in the list of those present , and was therefore ' assumed to be in sympathy with the objects of the ' meeting , issued this statement yesterday : " On Thursday I received a telegram from Mr. Emerson P. Jennings , President of the Lehigh Machine Company of Lehighton , Pa. , requesting me to ' come to Washington to participate in a conference with reference to Russian trade . Assuming that this conference had something to do with the recent statement issued by the Supreme Council in Paris , authorizing trade with the Co-operative Societies in Russia , I indicated my acceptance , and attended the conference . " After the meeting got under way , I was surprised to find that a large proportion of those , present seemed to be Soviet sympathizers , and to be actuated by the purpose of passing resolutions favorable to direct dealings with the Soviet Government , resolutions , as a matter of fact , which . seethed to be political propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that there were others present who shared my point of view , and who had evidently come to the meeting believing as I did that the broader question of Russian trade was to be discussed . " On the other hand , there were a number there who evidently desired to establish . immediate relations with the Soviet Government of Russia and to demand from the Department of State permission to make shipments of merchandise into Soviet Russia and to the Soviet Government . " In a short statement at the meeting I tried to make clear my own position with reference to - Russian trade , and stated that . if any progress whatever was to be made in establishing trade with Russia at the present time , it should be clearly indicated that the conference was . one ' of business meri only and that those present were not interested in the political aspect of the situation . I also pointed out that those present at ? the conference represented only a handful of . American manufaCtusers and that many of the most important companies interested in Russia were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned 1 withdrew from the conference . Payments of Doubtful Legality . " From my point oi ' view there are three ? fact8 of outstanding importance in connection with trade with Russia at the , present moment : " First , the problem of Russia is so important that it is essential for the United States to develop a constructive policy toward Russia , wise in its decision and comprehensive in its scope , which will be of benefit to American business interests and to the Russian people . " Second , if it is possible to develop unrestricted and independent business transactions with individual firms in Russia and with the Russian Co-operative Societies without any direct dealings with the ? Soviet Government , such transactions would be of definite assistance : and I agree with Mr. Hoover that such business relations would tend to restore normal conditions in Russia . Unless this degree of independence of the Soviet Government could be attained , I should think that any such policy would then be futile . " Third , the establishment of any trade between the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on a barter basis . This is true because any transactions based on the payment in cold by the Soviet Government involves the question of the legality of such payments . It is a question whether or not any American firm would be willing to accept direct trade relationships with the Soviet Government or its representatives in view of the fact that such Americans firms , by accepting gold as payment , would be in the position of receivers of stolen property . This is especially true in view of the fact that a considerable portion of the gold now held by the Soviet Government is gold placed in Moscow by the Government of Rumania and there held in trust . " I believe that the restoration of Russia as a free and independent State under a liberal and democratic government , is of vital importance both from the standpoint of the general international situation and also from the viewpoint of the permanent extension of American industrial . and commercial interests . " Others Gave o Indorsement . H. E. Boyer , the-New , York representative of Morris &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's purpose , but said he was there to get information , and was inclined to regard Russia as a potential competitor rather than as a market for American packers . On the other hand , he said that there might be a large immediate demand for condensed milk . Another man who was there for the purpose of getting information , it , was said yesterday , was former Street Cleaning Commissioner John ' I ' . Fetherston , who attended at the request of some New York business interests ; without indorsing the movement Adolph Warshow of the Ajax Paper Mills , another of those present , asserted yesterday , however , that the movement had started well and would be continued . Mr. Warshow argued that there was a considerable impetus behind it , as he said , could be seen in the fact that forty-five firms were represented at the meeting on Saturday after telegrams calling it had been sent out the day before . I think 99 per cent . of those at the meeting were opposed to Bolshevism , " said Mr. Warshow , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroachment in that party , " but we believe that America should-enter upon:Russian trade on an equal feting with ; ! the business men of other eantries . " A. Hanburger , an importer of hair . and bristles of 86 . John.:Street , another of the -- conferees , ? said- that Russian bristles were so scarce and the demand throughout the world so great that they . had lgefped in price - from $3 to $18 ? pound .. " We understand . " said Mr. Ham- , ' burger , " that the State Department says ' Wait and see what other countries do about it . ' We feel that . if we wait and see we will be too-late . " Wants Trade with Non-Soviet Russia . M. L. Iger , who attended the confer . ends as the representative of the Orioning Company of this city , said : advices from agents in Constantin the Italians are Carry . ins : : on a large trade in Russia at Odessa and through the'Biack Sea region . " Mr. Iger.did not mention the fact that until a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled the slack Sea region absolutely . and it has not yet fully passed into the control of the Lenin Government . Russia . " he continued , " is also trading with Germany , which controlled most of her raw materials before the war . There is a vast accumulation of hides and leather in Russia . From the reports there should be enough to lower the price of shoes in this country by 50 per cent . unless the price is kept up artificially . " George Scheftel of Doniger &; Co. , 73 Fifth Avenue . said that his firm was negotiating contracts for supplying the Soviet Government with surgical instruments , the money involved being between $300,000 and $1,000,000 . J. M. Arnow of Lied , inc. , exporters and importers of this city , , said that the Soviet representatives had informed them that the first ship out of Soviet Russia would carry a large supply of platinum in its ' cargo , as the most . precious product of Russia and one of the chief exports offered by Russia to guarantee payments to importers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the meeting , according to several New York men who were here , was not whether Russia should temain isolated ; ' but whether American business men should be permitted to deal with Russia first-hand or through foreign intermediaries . The ? wireless announcement of the Soviet Government that it would not permit trade without an armistice did not become known until it was printed , in Sunday morning 's TIMES , and the conferees therefore had no knowieage of it . Isaac Hourwich. councilor for the Soviet mission in this country , said yesterday that the Soviet Government ** not intend to part with its gold , which would destroy the little value left in Soviet currency , but would finance its purchases by its exports , especially platinum , of which he said that the Soviet controlled 95 per cent . of the world 's supply , and which has risen in value in the last few years from $28 to $80 an ounce . Men in the platinum trade have in fact put its present value at some three times that set by Mr. Hourwich . Fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times . WASHINGTON , Jan. ** members of the " American Commercial Association to Promote Trade with Russia , " organized here Saturday , who remained over in the hope of appearing before Secretary of State Ldrising to protest against what they call the unfair position now taken by the State Department in regard to trade relations with the Soviet Government , were disappointed today . When they applied for an interview at the State Department they were informed that Secretary Lansing was ill at his home . According to an announcement which was made public by the association tonight , a committee then made inquiries at the White House , and were told they might see Mr. Lansing tomdrrow if he was able to leave his home . They therefore decided to remain here at least another twenty-four hours . This committee has among its members E. P. Jennings , President of the Lehigh Machine Company , who presided at the gathering in the Raleigh Hotel Saturday when the association was formed . Mr. Jennings was one of the leading figures in the sessions at which the association was formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee . Mr. Jennings has taken an interest in the proceedings before the stib-committee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , which is investigating Soviet activities , and before which Ludwig C. A. K. Martens , self-styled Soviet Ambassador . is testifying . Mr. Jennings protested to Senator Moses , Chairman of the . sub-committee , against - the appointment of Archibald Stevenson as counsel for the sub-committee , holding- that he was prejudiced against Martens . Jennings also said that he had a contract with Martens for printing presses involving $1,000,000 , and had been unable to make shipment . To Have a Meeting Here . An announcement rent out by the association tonight contained this statement : " The committee calling upon Secretary Lansing tomorrow morning will immediately thereafter prepare a report embodying the results of the conference , which report will be submitted to the meeting which is to be held on Monday next . convening at 11 o'clock in the Hotel Knickerbocker , in New York City . A very large and representative attendance of representatives of large import , export , and various concerns from various parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Commercial Association to Promote Trade with Russia , which is the official title of the recently created organization adopted at the Washington meeting , will select a delegation of American business men to proceed to Russia to represent the association and American manufacturing and commercial interests generally , and the committee will endeavor to ascertain from the Secretary of State the extent of co-operation that may be expected from the State Department , and whether or not this committee can depend upon the unqualified support of this Government .
