Twelve of the Board of Tax Appeals , which has been created by the new Revenue Act , assembled together for the first time . Garrard B. Winston , Under Secretary of the Treasury , and Acting Secretary in Mr. Mellon 's absence , addressed them with pellucid words . He told the Board what was expected of it . <P> Until the present time , he explained , when a case that was at all doubtful came before the Revenue Bureau , it was decided against the taxpayer . The Bureau could not decide against itself and then bring suit against the taxpayer . So the poor taxpayer had to pay the assessment , just or not , and then sue to recover it . If the taxpayer won , he had settled , at his cost , the doubts of the tax-collectors . <P> Under the new system , in a dubious case , taxpayer and Treasury both present their views to the Board of Tax Appeals . If the Board decides in favor of the Treasury , then the taxpayer must pay first and sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the taxpayer , he pays what he thinks he should and the Treasury sues . <P> Mr. Winston added a few golden admonitions for the Board : <P> " If your Board permits its docket to become congested , the Government is delayed in the collection of its revenue and in order to operate must find revenue elsewhere . For the next few years , back-taxes are a very material part of the Government 's receipts . During the last fiscal year they probably ran as high as $400,000,000 . . . You should not permit yourselves to be lost in involved and tedious law suits . Make yourselves an administrative body to settle taxes . Give speedy decisions . To delay is to deny justice-both to the Government and the taxpayer . "
