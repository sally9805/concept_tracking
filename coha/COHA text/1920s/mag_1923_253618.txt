Who Would n't Be a Pirate ? <P> The Story . After his harrying of the late Invincible Armada , Sir Oliver Tressilian has returned to his estate in Cornwall , resolved on a quiet life and marriage with fair Rosamund Godolphin . He is , however , taunted with his former piracy by Rosamund 's young brother , Peter , and by Sir John Killigrew , who also wishes to marry Rosamund . Of course the great Sir Walter Raleigh and Hawkins had in their time been pirates and knighted for it by Queen Elizabeth ; but Sir Oliver rightly resents the insult and nearly kills Sir John in a duel . Unfortunately young Lionel Tressilian , a scapegrace , kills Peter Godolphin in a drunken duel . Sir Oliver shelters his brother and takes the blame , and Rosamund believes him guilty . <P> Lionel is worse than a drunkard : he wishes Oliver 's estate , and has him kidnapped to be sold as a slave to the Moors . In rage and bitterness Sir Oliver forswears his religion and becomes a Barbary Corsair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desperate coup of vengeance . As Sakr-el-Bahr , the Sea-Hawk , he descends with his pirates upon the Cornish coast and steals Lionel and Rosamund on the eve of their wedding . <P> Here is the full measure of revenge ! Sir Oliver forces his young brother to work as a slave in the galleys , and sells fair Rosamund as a slave in the open market , only to buy her himself after fierce bargaining with the pasha . He nearly loses favor by this act , but equips another galley and takes to the sea . By chance he comes upon an English vessel sent to rescue Rosamund and in charge of the dry and bitter ( but just ) Sir Henry Goade . By this time Sir Oliver is beginning to feel the emptiness of vengeance . He saves the English ship from destruction by threatening to blow up the Barbary galley , is surrendered to the English , and tried for piracy against his own nation . But Sir Henry Goade realizes all the arguments in favor of the Sea-Hawk- the terrible injustice done him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing of all ) Rosamund 's love for him now that she knows what he has suffered . <P> The Significance . Though announced as a new novel and with no mention of the previous copyright , The Sea-Hawk is really a reprint of one of Sabatini 's first novels . For that very reason , however , it is much better than his later and more successful but less brilliantly written romances . Both in style and color The Sea-Hawk continues the best traditions of the historical romance written frankly for pleasure and excitement . Sabatini is not at all " the modern Dumas " as some critics insist on calling him . He does n't write in the grand manner of the great Frenchman , but rather on the smaller , but often equally exciting scale of Stevenson and Stanley Weyman . The Sea-Hawk is accurate and picturesque in history ; but it never drags or preaches or forces historical scholarship or tedious archaisms upon the reader . <P> The Critics . Most of the critics have not noticed that The Sea-Hawk is a reprint ; but almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New York Tribune speaks of the " gorgeous plot " ; the Boston Herald names it " a colorful and dramatic tale " ; the Boston Transcript praises it highly as " a marvel of its kind .
