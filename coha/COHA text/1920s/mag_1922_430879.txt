the Father in Child Training By Frederic Arnold Kummer I N THESE days of stress , when the energies of most men are largely absorbed by the pursuit of the necessary dollar , it is difficult for the father to devote much time or attention to the upbringing of his children , and yet it is doubtful whether the average father fully realizes how much both he and the child are missing , how much might be accomplished by the expenditure of even a few hours a week . The writer would not have the temerity to discuss this subject were it not for two fortuitous circumstances . The first is. that he has three growing children of his own ; the second , that , his work being largely done at home , he has a more intimate companionship with his children than falls to the lot of most fathers , and a correspondingly greater opportunity to take part in their training . Some of his experiences in the development of the youthful mind may prove of value to other parents not so fortunately situated as himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not realize that the character of the child is molded in infancy and is largely determined by the time he reaches the age of ten . This is a serious thought , and one which should inspire in the parent an equally serious sense of responsibility . When we pause to consider that what we say or do , what we fail to say or do , during I l l u s t r a t e d by James Montgomery Flagg those few early years in the child 's life may ? indeed , will ? determine to a great extent his future , we begin to realize some of the responsibilities of parenthood . Two things the child must do during those early years in his life . One is to acquire knowledge . Few of us stop to consider that within the few , brief years from five to , say . fifteen , the youthful mind must assimilate practically all the knowledge of the elementary facts of existence which it has taken the human race half . a million years to accumulate . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means so important as the one which goes hand in hand with it ? the development of character . The writer does not believe that character building can be accomplished by precept . A child will not become truthful , for instance , because he is told to be truthful , nor because he is punished for being untruthful . The right way to build and develop a child 's moral fiber is to teach him to think straight , to avoid what is false , to seek the truth . The acquisition of facts constitutes knowledge . The habit of right thinking forms character . Of the two , as has been said above , the latter is by far the more important . " To knowledge have and wisdom lack is a load of books on an ass 's back , " was well said . If we look about us and examine the manifold ills which inflict the world , we shall see that the majority of them arise from lack of right thinking . Integrity of mind and character is the most valuable asset a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time to the indiscriminate accumulation of facts , too little to intelligent thinking about them . It was to bring about the latter result that the writer undertook with his own children the experiments described below . Were it within the power of any of us to create , out of nothing , a living human being , we should still be confronted with the problem of endowing such a being with knowledge , character , moral fiber ? in a word , of educating him before we would dare to turn him free as a member of society . Precisely the same task confronts us when we assume the responsibilities of parenthood . No parent has the right to dodge that responsibility , even though the time which may be devoted to it is limited . It will not do to shift the task to the school-teacher . Some are inefficient , while almost none feels , or could be expected to feel , the personal interest in the child that is felt by his parents . The growing child finds himself emerging , month by ( Continued on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into a strange , a marvelous world . He is surrounded by things of which he knows nothing . His only way of finding out about them is to ask questions . Parents frequently complain that their children " pester " them by demanding to know the why and wherefore of everything under the sun . As a matter of fact , failure on a child 's part to do this would be alarming , would stamp him as a mental defective . It is in the proper answering of these childish questions that the opportunity of the parent , and especially of the father , lies . And for placing a large part of this burden on the father there is good reason . Every child looks upon his father as a remote and somewhat superior person whose interest he is constantly seeking to enlist . His mother 's interest he already has ; she is closer to him , and for that very reason not so important a figure . The questions he desires to ask relate largely to material things , and he is apt to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things than his mother does . The stage is already set for the father to play the part of-the oracle , and any father who fails to avail himself of this opportunity to the limit of his time and ability is wasting one of the choicest privileges of fatherhood . Real Explanations Are Needed It has been the writer 's observation that too many parents make no effort really to explain things to their children . They are content to answer the numberless questions the child may ask with the stock phrase , " You are too young to understand . " The result is that the child becomes discouraged and either stops asking questions altogether , which would mean stultification , or else asks them of others , of his companions , of servants , who through ignorance or lack of interest , or both , fill the child 's mind with a stock of rubbish . Further , those parents who think , or say , that their children are too young to understand , are usually too lazy or too indifferent to try to help them understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much children can understand , if only some one has the patience to put things before them in an understandable way . It may be set down as an axiom that the questions asked by the child should never be evaded , never be answered untruthfully . The parent , the father , should endeavor above all things to establish in the child 's mind a supreme belief in his truthfulness , almost his infallibility . When a child catches a grown-up in a lie , his respect for that particular grown-up vanishes and can not readily be restored . A , s an example , one of the writer 's children , a boy of seven , wanted to know where the rain came from . To say , " From the clouds , " would have been easy , but not sufficient . It seemed better to explain , by means of the tea-kettle , how heat turns water into steam ; how the heat of the sun , falling on lakes , the ocean , slowly evaporates the water ; how this water vapor , being warmer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how these vapor clouds , when chilled by the cold upper air , turn back into water again and fall in the form of rain . All this is , of course , very elementary , and no doubt most parents have done it . Simply explained , such ideas are not difficult for even a very young mind to grasp . So far , so good . But not long after , the same child asked a nurse what caused thunder , and was told that it was the noise made by the clouds when they knocked together . Instantly the child 's sense of logic was outraged . If clouds were vapor , like steam , how could they make a noise by knocking together ? Either the nurse had lied to him , or his father . He demanded an explanation . What really did make thunder ? Right here we have an example of the importance of the proper answering of the child 's  | questions . The first explanation , the one about the rain , had set up in the child 's mind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of nature 's great elemental processes . How to connect the thunder explanation to the previous one in a logical and convincing manner was the problem . It was finally solved by walking briskly across a large rug and producing an electric spark by presenting a knuckle to one of the metal radiators . The spark , it was explained , was a tiny lightning flash ; the crackle made by it was miniature thunder . When the clouds , which carry electricity , become too full of it , the surplus flashes back to the earth in the form of an electric spark many hundreds of feet long , and its crackle , many hundreds of times louder than that of our tiny spark at the radiator , is the noise we call thunder . It required a little ingenuity to put the answer in just this way , but it was worth many times the effort involved , for the child really understood . From that time on he refused to pay serious attention to anything told him by the nurse ; she had become discredited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , were a father to become so discredited ! All this may seem quite elemental , and at first blush to involve nothing particularly new . But the little incident has been cited for a reason . The child , in grasping the idea that clouds are formed of water vapor , had begun to think . He had not only acquired a fact , formed a correct mental conception of what a cloud is , but he had set up in his mind a logical train of thought ; namely , water , through the sun 's heat , turning to vapor . Unless his newly acquired mental concept was to be destroyed , his faith in his reasoning powers shattered , the making of the thunder explanation in understandable and convincing form was imperative . Otherwise he would have been left floundering in a sea of doubt . Suppose , now- , we multiply this process a thousandfold ? apply it to a thousand properly or improperly answered questions , and we begin to see what the effect might be , so far as the child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how few parents are willing to take the time and trouble to answer their children 's questions simply and correctly , it is not surprising that the majority of children grow up with muddled minds , unable to think correctly , if indeed they are able to think at all . Books Are Not Sufficient A great deal can be accomplished , in certain ways , by the use of the various books of information which parents place in the hands of their children , but such books are of little value in teaching children to think . This arises from the fact that the information in them is not properly presented . On one page the child is told why fruits and flowers have brilliant colors ; on the next , how glass is made ; on a third , the reason for the tides or the methods used in boring for oil . It can not be denied that these are all useful things to know , ut they are entirely unrelated , and the child merely stores them away like so many brightcolored pebbles . without understanding what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a composite whole . To pour such a mass of unrelated facts into a child 's mind is very much like heaping together in a confused pile a vast number of picture puzzle blocks . No coherent pattern results . The child 's mind becomes a crazy-quilt of information , which he has the ability neither to understand nor to use . The writer 's efforts with his children have all been along the lines of linking each bit of knowledge , as it is presented , to some other bit aleady understood . In this way the child begins to form in his mind a definite picture . This interests him , makes him eager to learn more . Each fact , as he fits it into place , becomes part of a growing , understandable whole .  | He begins to think , to reason , to draw conclusions , to find apparent contradictions which he must explain or have explained to him , and thus his mental vision broadens intelligently , as it would not if he heaped together his bits of knowledge haphazard . To come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us assume , for example , that a child asks why a balloon goes up . Obviously the answer is , because it contains a gas which , being lighter than air , rises . Then comes the question , " What is a gas ? " Well , a gas is a gas , and that is as far as many fathers will go . But it would not be difficult to link this question up with our previous explanation concerning clouds and rain . Water , for instance , is a solid at low temperature ? ice . Heat it , and it turns to a liquid . Heat it some more , and it turns to a gas , steam . At once the child has grasped a basic fact , that matter may exist in any one of three forms , solid , liquid , gaseous , depending on its temperature . Steam , being warmer and lighter than air , rises , as we have seen in our talk about rain clouds , but it could not be used for balloons , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balloon would fall . Other gases , however , are not so affected by cold ? at least by such cold as exists in the upper air . Some day your boy will want to know the meaning of such an absurd thing as liquid air . By recalling to his mind the basic principle previously grasped , he will immediately be able to understand that air , too , can be turned into a liquid , even frozen into a solid , by cold . New Facts Supplement the Old When , later on , some question about the casting or molding of iron or lead comes up , you may take the trouble to melt a bit of lead foil in a kitchen spoon to demonstrate the principle , but it will scarcely be necessary . One of the writer 's children was greatly interested , the other day , in a bit of mercury from a broken thermometer . The thought that a metal might be a liquid at ordinary temperatures had not previously occurred to him , but instead of being confused by it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would become a solid , too , which was true enough , and showed that he had fitted another bit of knowledge into its proper place in his mental make-up . The writer remembers having been told as a boy that flies can walk on the ceiling because they stick to it with their feet . The explanation did not go far enough ; and gave rise to an impression , persistent for many years , that the feet of flies were equipped with some sticky , fly-papery compound which enabled them to cling to the ceiling . It would have been comparatively simple to have explained the tiny suckers on a fly 's feet ? to have come right out with an explanation of the vacuum . Such an explanation will save a deal of trouble in the long run , for our old friend , the vacuum , is bound to crop up many times again , whether in relation to pumps , vacuum cleaners , the cause of storms , or why you can suck lemonade through a straw . The writer has found it better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before long you find him hanging his facts on them like ornaments on a Christmas tree . A favorite question ? with the writer 's children , at least ? is " Who made the first ? " whatever it may be ? Let us say the first boat . It would be simple to say , " The early men ? cave dwellers ? savages . " But it would not teach the child anything . On the other hand , a simple narrative may be invented , telling how some early man , fleeing from an enemy , paddled across a stream astride a log . At once the child becomes interested . FIe wants to hear more and , if one can spare the time to do it , will listen eagerly while he is told about the raft , the canoe dug from a log , the first galleys with their banks of oars , etc. , etc . Or perhaps , when you tell of hollowing out a log to make a canoe , you will be asked " What  | and you have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you speak of the use of fire to burn out the canoe , the question " Where did they get the fire ? " will probably arise . Soon the father , if he has the time and patience , finds himself a partner in a fascinating game , and one which is often as interesting to him as it is to the child . And the results are astonishing , not merely because the youngsters have learned about the raft , the stone ax , the canoe , but because they have begun to picture in their mind the history of man and his achievements . There are times , of course , when you will be faced with embarrassing questions not easy to answer . When you are , you should rejoice in the fact , because it shows that your efforts have begun to bear fruit . The child accepts , let us say , the fundamental fact that iron , steel , being heavier than water , will sink . Presently he learns , in your little talk about boats , that modern ships are built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think will accept this without question . Facts to him are merely facts , isolated bits of knowledge that bear no relation to one another . But the child whose mind has been trained- to reason refuses to accept what is to him an apparent contradiction . If iron sinks , how can an iron ship float ? You will be obliged to show him , perhaps by means of a tin-cup floating in a basin of water , that metal , when rolled out thin and enclosing a large amount of air , will float because of that air and of the heavier water it displaces . You may even hark back to your balloon and point out that the silk covering or envelope of the balloon would not float in air , any more than iron will float in water , were it not stretched out to enclose a large amount of gas . He may not always understand the scientific explanation , but he will usually get a fair idea of the principle involved . The examples given above are fragmentary and serve merely to illustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their underlying principles , the constant crossreferences , as it were , form the basis of the writer 's system , and with his own children it has worked wonders . No matter what the subject of the various little talks may be , they usually lead back , in some form or other , to the early history of man and his environment . The average child is principally interested in the material facts he sees about him , and adequate explanation of those facts is rarely possible without reaching back to the beginning of things . Suppose you are asked where the sand at the seashore comes from ? It is possible , of course , to say that it is washed up by the ocean , but if you are asked how it got there in the first place , you are no better off than you were before . It is easier , in the long run , to explain how the earth was once a molten mass ; how a rocky crust slowly cooled upon it ; how heat and cold , acting through countless ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain could wash down millions of little particles into the valleys , the ocean , to form mud , earth , sand . This once grasped , many subsequent questions will be more easily answered , more quickly understood . The Connection with Character It may be asked what all this has to do with character building . The answer is obvious . Having interested the child , having gained his belief in your knowledge , your truthfulness , having taught him to think rightly and made him your companion and friend , you are in a position to tell him that it is wrong to lie , ignoble to cheat , unworthy of him to deceive , with the sure knowledge that he will believe you . You have his confidence . He is convinced that what you tell him is true . And when you point out to him why such things as lying , cheating , deception , are wrong , the right @#  | methods of thinking which he has acquired will instantly lead him to the same conclusions , so that he is , not obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Father 's Responsibility The responsibility of the father , in the training of the child , is one which he should welcome . It is not only unfair , but often inadequate , to leave the entire duty of home training to the mother . The growing child sees his father as a vastly important character , who vanishes from his little world early in the morning land usually returns to it in the evening , tired , hungry , with no time for his children except to bid them good night . This , of course , is not right . Neither the child nor the father is getting out of their relationship what he should . If , slowly but surely , the child grows up to exclude his father from his little world , what hope can there be of mutual understanding when the days of childhood are past and real problems take the place of imaginary ones ? The writer fully understands how little time the busy father usually has , but even ahalf-hour of intimate association with a child daily , a kindly interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suggestion as to the books he should read , would be of the utmost value in establishing a basis of comradeship . And on Sundays , hours devoted exclusively to the child 's interests will bring their ' own reward . One should try to put the youngsters on a plane of equality , to become their interested friend ? a friend who has something real in the way of sympathy and help , to offer . It is not always easy at first , because children are naturally ' inclined to be secretive with their elders , but when it has been done , when this confidence has been established , it will be found that the children will come to you at once with their problems and will listen eagerly , gratefully , to your advice . It is easy to see what this will mean as the child grows older , and more serious problems enter his life . The boy or girl who , when in trouble , seeks his father as a friend is not apt to go far afield when real temptations arise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of firmness ; children must be made to obey , but they are far more likely to obey when their reason , their sense of right is appealed to , when they are made to understand why a thing is unwise , wrong , than they are to obey blindly under threat of punishment . And if the character has been rightly formed , if the child habitually thinks straight , he will be better prepared to meet and overcome life 's many problems than he will if his mental processes are meaningless , irrational , based on impulse rather than on logic , reason , and the habit of right thinking . For the busy father who has not the time to devote to his children that he would like , a number of books are available in which an effort is made to present to the child the facts he needs in some sort of orderly arrangement . The writer is responsible for one book of this character , which undertakes to give the child a brief but comprehensive outline of man 's early efforts in the accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growing child , should help greatly in his mental development , Out this reading should be supplemented by explanation and discussion , in order that the feeling of comradeship between father and child may be established and the process of character building begun . Clean-minded , honest , straight-thinking boys and girls become clean-minded , honest , straight-thinking men and women . Their character , once established , will not change . An hour or two a week , even , devoted to that end , covering but the short period from five years to , say , twelve , probably would in the long run prove of vastly greater value to the child in after life than the money which every father strives to lay aside for his children . Character , in man or woman , is what counts . Help the child to form it , and you will have laid aside for him an inheritance more precious than rubies .
