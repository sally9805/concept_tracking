Barber 's Consternation <P> Sirs : <P> As contrasted with TIME-snoozer Brown ( LETTERS , Oct. 15 ) , I saw last evening the champion TIME addict . He insisted upon reading TIME much to the consternation of the barber , while being SHAVED . I think that 's the limit . <P> V. G. STRICKLAND <P> Germantown , Pa . <P> <P> Subscriber Brown fell asleep in Council Bluffs , Iowa , while reading TIME . He has not stated what bored him. - ED . <P> <P> Anderson Flayed <P> Sirs : <P> I hope Mr. Anderson feels better after plagiarizing a cheap , trashy , vulgar poem and sending to TIME with the suggestion that it is the " Texas version " of the presidential campaign . If I may use language as vulgar as he-what the hell does he know about the " Texas version " ? He gives his address as Los Angeles . <P> I am a firm believer in straightforward honesty and uprightness . I do n't believe Mr. Anderson is very confident in his prediction of a landslide for Hoover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe he is another Republican who is afraid of a beating and resorts to the dastardly act of creating vile propaganda to prevent it . <P> If Al Smith is as bad as some of the " Mr. Andersons " say , then I 'm for hanging him . There is little doubt in my mind but Herbert Hoover will be elected : but as to the " Texas version " - well , I 'm afraid Mr. Anderson 's poem will have no influence . <P> ZACK ZACKERS <P> Houston , Texas . <P> <P> Scurrilous <P> Sirs : <P> Please discontinue sending copies of TIME to this address . The tone of your magazine is not only hostile but insulting to members of the Catholic Church as the scurrilous verse on page 4 , issue of Oct. 8 proves . TIME was recommended to me by you as a magazine of high standard but I find it unfit to be placed in the hands of our teachers and pupils . <P> SISTER MARY BASIL , O. P. <P> Watertown , Mass . <P> <P> The lines which vexed Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule the United States <P> And the Jews grow a straight nose ; <P> When Pope Pius is head of the Ku Klux Klan , <P> In the land of Uncle Sam- <P> Then Al Smith will be President <P> And the Country wo n't be worth a dam . . . . <P> ( Alvin G. Anderson ) - ED . <P> <P> Putrid Soul <P> Sirs : <P> Please print the following as a counter to Mr. Alvin G. Anderson 's attack on the Democratic nominee : <P> When your dear man Count ' Oover <P> Has won or lost the coveted goal , <P> And Hell is sizzling pleasantly over <P> Your bigoted , ignorant , putrid soul . . . <P> Succeeding lines unprintable <P> Apropos of the little Irish ditty " The pig in the parlor ; " has Alvin G. Anderson heard that little one " you ca n't make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . " <P> A. LANDERS <P> San Francisco , Calif . <P> <P> " Speach " <P> Sirs : <P> In a parabolic curve the Hoover procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung through Cambridge from Charlestown to Boston .
