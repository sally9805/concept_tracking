txt C. M. Keys , president of Curtiss-Wright Corp .. believes that the wild-cat stages of the industry which existed in 1929 have passed and that the future promises further expansion on a sound basis . In an interview with a representative or The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Keys stated that profits of the industry would be considerably below the high estimates made during the height of the summer boom . but " compared with other , days we have known they will be very satisfac ; tory . " He pointed out that many companies financed earlier in the year and operating on an , unsound basis are passing out of the picture but that the larger companies continue to expand their operations conservatively . Reaction From Boom " After complete study of all phases of aviation . I have no hesitation in stating that the reaction in the trade has been grossly exaggerated . " said Mr. Keys . " Most if it is , in fact , a reaction from a boom , which played no part in the plans or policies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seasonal , especially in motors . Many of the smaller manufacturers , especially those not well financed , hold up their orders for motors through the winter because they will not deliver their products until spring and are reluctant to pay for and carry the motors for so many months . The motor maker , therefore , has to decide whether he will build and stock his products , or build them and consign them to his best customers , or build only what he knows he can sell currently or for sure in the spring . " In 1929 , three times as many Wright motors were wanted in April as could be delivered . That might have led to a reckless expansion policy for 1930  --  but it did n't . We have slowed down the Wright plant to a sane and safe basis , and are taking advantage of the first chance in some years to build up engineering , tighten up manufacturing methods and generally lay foundations for sound future progress . Cleaning Loose Ends " In all branches of trade there is a wholesome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little transport concerns that started in the boom because they could get easy money , and have operated planes at from half to threr ( 1u:1r:cr= the true cost of operation , are going out of business for lack of new capital to pay operating expenses . In the same way , literally hundreds of individual operators have been carrying on so-called training and taxi service at rates that provide for neither depreciation nor reserves . " These operations , now dropping out rapidly . made it hard to ertablish flying on a business basis that can pay a profit . All the bigger transport concerns , T. A. T .. Western Boeing . Universal , for instance , provided ample reserves of capital and have been building for the time when , through the growth of volume of traffic and the betterment of equipment , a fair margin would be established . All of them welcome the passing of the wild-cat stage as the first step toward the goal . Plans Are C'onsenative " The buying by quickly financed but inefficient operators constituted a sort of bubble demand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , for instance , had been misled by this . we would have built the Curtiss-Robertson plant at St. Louis four times as large as it is . None of the old-time leaders of the business seriously considered the flashy market of 1929 as a permanent development and they will gain by its passing ? ' Air transport in the l'ruted States gains all the time Both the volume and the qualli. ? of the air mail service go on a steady upi.vArci curve , although here , too , there has been some wild-catting . The passenger transport busuaass goes slowly , patiently and sometimes painfully Traffic development is difficult , as new kinds of travel always are . Nevertheless , the curve is upward . None of the larger companies have slowed down their development . The T. A. T. executive committee recently laid down a program that calls for more than double the present operation , and at the same time Universal did the same thing . Flying Service Gains " There has been steady and consistent growth of service flying , training , taxi . cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7 , - 500,000 , was plenty to cover the country with new schools and fields and hangars . We wish we had made it twice as much . Lest than a year old , the Curtiss Flying Service in August , September and October flew about a million miles a month . Steadily the student roll mounts . In June it was 600 ; in July 750 : in August 800 ; in September 900 ; and in October for the first time it crossed 1,000 . " The future of aviation in all its phases continues to promise sound growth . We used to think that 50 or 60 training planes were a big order . A week ago our executive committee placed an order to build 100 Curtiss Fledglings , a Navy type training plane , because the fields must have them as soon as'they can get them . ? ' I think profits from aviation in 1929 will be well below the estimates of the summer time . But . Compared with other days we have known , they will be very satisfactory .
