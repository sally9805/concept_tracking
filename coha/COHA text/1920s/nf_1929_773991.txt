txt HOMECRAFT RUGS is mentioned in Act of Parliament one hundred years prior to the time ( 1488-1588 ) , this does not alter the truth that Spain was the channel through which knitting came to England , and thence to America . Some of the very finest knitting patterns existent are those which the in-habitants of the Faire Isles learned from the ship-wrecked Spanish sailors who sought refuge there . Such patterns have retained their distinction through the cen turies and come as a rich heritage to the rug makers of to-day . They bear little resemblance to other plainer pat-terns , found elsewhere in England , and clearly show Moorish tendencies ; and quite naturally so , as the Span iards learned knitting from the Moors . It seems odd that craftsmen have not more generally employed these Oriental motifs which are veritable an cient knitting patterns with the dignity and character suited to rug making . No difficulty arises in using them , for they are brought out in knitting stitchery , and require no technical adaptation . In them , one is forcibly reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indebted to the Spaniards , ( hence the Moors ) for much of their knowledge . When these are developed in rugs of flat weave there is that concord of pattern and method which is stressed by all true craftsmen . The type of knit ting from the Faire Isles is minus pile , though pile can be effectively introduced into it if one desires to emulate an altogether modern style of knitting . No exact date can be ascribed to the introduction of pile 80 KNIT RUGS into plain knitting . There is a theory that it was through the desire to copy " Turkey work , " especially in rug making , that it was devised . In any event , it is the rugs of pile knitting that hold highest rank to-day in this particular craft . Their superiority dates back to 1876 , when carpet ravelings were recommended for the medium . Knit rugs made their appearance in the latter part of the eighteenth and early years of the nineteenth centuries . Unfortunately this was not an era of exquisite homecraft rugs , but of practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs that have come to us through the intervening years stress the practical rather than the ornamental . This should not act as a barrier to presentday development of knit rugs into carpets of decorative value . With a better understanding of the craft and its powers , a fresh stimulus should be gained . No more elaborate equipment for knitting rugs is required than two pointed round sticks , or skewers , which were originally used . The reversible needle , now always found in steel knitting-needles , and the wooden and bone composition needle with ball tip at one end to prevent the work from slipping off , were later acquisitions . Some of these needles have finely carved knobs , as one pair , which it is the good fortune of the writer to own , gives proof . They are made from the ivory of a whale 's tooth and were carved by some sailor to while away the tedium of a long voyage . Neither the double pointing nor the addition of knobs to the needles in any manner alters the mechanical na-81 HOMECRAFT RUGS ture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the craft . In rug making , large needles are used in accord with the coarse medium . They may be of steel , and therefore reversible , of wood , or of composition with the knob ends . Wooden needles are a popular choice . They come in extra-large sizes and are strong and flexible . The largest steel needles are best suited to pile knitting . The needles of corresponding size in wood or composition have a tendency to bend slightly under the weight of work not done in zephyrs . Except in pile rugs , the medium is generally strands of cloth . Elasticity is a quality inherent in knitting , and it should be understood at the very start that this elasticity is something to cope with . It must be turned to advantage , as indeed it is in certain types of rug , and it must be handled dexterously in other types in order to get results thoroughly satisfactory . It is also possible to make good use of the seemingly destructive raveling trait in knitting ? that is , in the rectifying of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially in the raveling and re-using of yarns from old scarfs , sweaters and other knit garments that have outlasted their usefulness . There is great economy in this salvaging of rug materials , which , when reknit , have every appearance of being fresh from the skein . The prevention of raveling when not desired is essential and can be simply accomplished by fastening the end of the thread securely . This is done by drawing it through 82 KNIT RUGS the last loop , as in crocheting , and interlacing the end through the knitted stitchery . Incidentally this also conceals the end of the medium . PART II METHODS OF MAKING The stitch of the knit rug is simplicity itself . It is always the plain one called " garter stitch " because so universally employed in making the earliest type of garters . The amazing thing is that with it both smooth-face and pile surfaces can be constructed , each in various effects , so that rugs of totally different styles result . Moreover so little medium does regulation knitting require that smooth-face rugs call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Economy is stressed with no sacrifice . of beauty . These are points to appeal to a rug maker . Rugs knit with a pile hold highest rank , although they take more material than smooth-face . These pile rugs fall into two classes according to their methods of construction , namely Smyrna and ravel pile rugs . The Smyrna are patricians in knit carpets . They are counted among the most exquisite of homecraft floor coverings . Hence they rightfully deserve first consideration . They take their name from Oriental Smyrna carpets which are their prototypes. 83J HOMECRAFT RUGS There was a time when all Eastern floor coverings with a pile were indiscriminately called Smyrna rugs , as , at an earlier period , they were termed " Turkey Carpets . " About the middle of the nineteenth century , when this transition of nomenclature was recognized , Smyrna knit rugs came into the prestige they hold to-day . It was also about this time that machine-made reproductions of Oriental Smyrna rugs were introduced . These domestic rugs fell so far short of the originals that the name fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the name Smyrna rug was so comprehensive that it included all knot floor coverings from that port of shipment , there is a specific knot carpet that correctly falls into this classification . This has certain characteristics which may well be cited , for they are found also in Smyrna knit floor coverings . These characteristics are a loose weave ; coarse wools ; Turkish motifs with no prescribed arrangement in field or border , and no restrictions as to color , although blues , reds and greens predominate . The use of the last-named color accords with the heterogeneous traits , for in Turkish rugs green is seldom found , it being held sacred , and hence not to be trod upon . The blues , especially favored by Armenians , and red by Turks , are naturally in evidence . When Smyrna knit rugs are correctly worked to carry out the Oriental characteristics in pattern and color , and are wrought in yarns , deftly sheared to give a surface of exquisite texture , they are rugs of real luxury and beauty . 84 KNIT RUGS They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of such distinction . The fact that they are made of yarn pile does not necessarily imply that they are costly rugs to make , for , as previously suggested , the yarn may already have served a purpose . Small quantities of yarn , fine or coarse , can thriftily be employed , but they must be introduced into the design as if to fill a need without suggesting economy as an object . It is when pile knitting is avowedly thrifty that its name immediately betrays its inferior character . No longer does it presume to be classed with Oriental floor coverings . The rugs , instead of being called Smyrna , then go by the commonplace name of " string rugs . " This term is descriptive not only of the foundation medium , but of the pile that may be oddments of yarn , wisps of cloth , etc. , which are mere slivers and strings of stuff , introduced hit-or-miss style . The wearing quality may be equal to that of the Smyrna , but the rugs are totally lacking in distinction , unless perchance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance these characteristics are in themselves sufficient to make the name Smyrna rug not altogether inconsistent for this rag rug variety . There is no difficulty in adapting patterns on Oriental rugs to Smyrna knitting . On architect 's draughting paper indicate the stitches exactly as when copying cross-stitch patterns . For the border take some simple border motif and use it in repetition , varying the colors when working ; or employ two or more motifs in combination . Narrow 85 HOMECRAFT RUGS strips of black or dark brown , knit separately , can be introduced between patterned border strips . For the field of the rug , copy a few field motifs and scatter them through the knitting against a background of blue , dark Oriental red , tan or some typical Oriental field color . Cross stitch , filet , and beadwork patterns can be carried out successfully in rug knitting of this sort , provided the designs are applicable to floor coverings . Designs from textiles can be copied also , and those from Oriental rug books , Persian and Indian embroideries , etc . Oddly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep to small sizes . There is really no reason for such a restriction . In Italy , that country from which so much knitting has emanated , knit carpets are frequently found in such large sizes that they completely cover the floors of spacious rooms . There , to-day , carpet and rug designs are to be had , with wools selected and directions supplied for making , exactly as tapestry-work patterns and materials are procurable here . The carpets are made in breadths of Smyrna knitting . These are seamed together by counted rows , as Brussels or other pile-woven carpets , thus insuring matching of patterns . These carpets are durable and luxuriously soft to the tread , since excellent yarn is employed for the pile . When colors are pleasing and correct , and designs well suited , these deep-pile , handicraft carpets are indeed handsome . Knit pile as found in Smyrna or " string rugs " is made in three different ways . It may be knot-knit , laid-in , or loop-knit . The first two ways call for pile of a secondary 86 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making one stitch . The last-named pile is made of a continuous strand which may be of the foundation medium or a secondary one . Shorter strands may be employed if a design is carried out in the loop knitting , or if a secondary medium should happen to come in short lengths . For rugcraft it is unwise to have the knitting medium and the pile medium identical , as the rug surface should be soft and the foundation stout . The knitting medium may be insignificant , such as twine ( that is not wirey , however ) ; strong string ; very coarse knitting or crochet cotton ; carpet warp ; jute yarn ; etc . Since it does not show , the essential quality is durability . The expert worker suits her foundation medium to the pile she employs so that the sizes are relatively correct . The pile may be yarn or textile . Yarn is cut into strands two inches long or some multiple of two inches , so that it can be doubled to make working strands of this length . The finer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be after it is sheared and tips of yarn only ( no loops ) remain . Textile ( rag ) strands are cut one and onehalf inches long and one-half inch wide for laid-in pile , and two inches long for knot-knit pile . It must always be remembered that weight of goods influences widths of strands . Therefore heavy textiles would be cut narrower , and sheer goods wider to conform to the one-half inch of average textiles . Owing to the tiny sizes of the scraps of yarn or textiles needed for laid-in or knot-knit pile , a rare opportunity is 87 II HOMECRAFT RUGS afforded to use up odds and ends of material . Avoid the pitfall of scrappy-looking floor coverings , by careful planning of design to suit the scraps . Fortunately patterns can be wrought into these pile rugs as easily as into knottied Oriental pile carpets . Each pile stitch is complete in itself and not dependent upon another . Laid-in pile is so called because it is actually so inserted . Knot-knit pile gets its name from the fact that each stitch is tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stitch bears as close a resemblance to the Ghiordes knot of Oriental rugs as is possible in the craft of knitting . It was devised by the writer for the purpose of further strengthening laid-in pile , which is not difficult to pull out . Both laid-in and knot-knit pile are fashioned alike with the single exception of the transverse part of the stitch in knot-knitting . Cast on as many stitches as will make the desired width of strip or unit , having the number preferably odd . Knit the first row , and each alternate row , plain . In the second row and each pile row , slip the first stitch . Lay a strand of pile medium across the work between the needles and knit the stitch regardless of it . Push the end of the pile that is on the inner side to the outer side of the work . This folds it about the stitch just taken and brings both ends of the pile on the same side of the knitting . Knit the next stitch plain . Continue knitting one pile stitch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the final stitch plain . Every other row must be pile and every other row plain knitting throughout the 88 KNIT RUGS work . So only will the pile always come on the same side of the knitting . Knot-knit pile is started as directed above . Then slip the first stitch in a pile row , lay a strand of the pile medium over the work and knit the stitch regardless of it . Push the inner strand of pile about the stitch just made and through to the outer side of the work . Before taking the next stitch draw the knitting strand over both strands of pile just inserted , and then make an ordinary plain stitch . The knitting medium will thus form a transverse strand that ties down the pile in knot fashion . In rugcraft it is indeed valuable . The work proceeds with one pile and one plain stitch , one pile and one plain row , exactly as already directed for laid-in pile rugs . A portion of Shirvan rug border worked in knotknitting is pictured in sampler B on Plate III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile surface . In Plate V the wrong side of this pile sampler is shown , giving the stitchery as it appears in the foundation . A fine jute yarn is used for the knitting medium , and tapestry yarn , cut into eight-inch lengths doubled twice , is employed for the pile . There are forty-nine Shirvan motifs in the border , yet owing to the deft manipulation of the seven colors employed , there are scarcely any duplicates . The background is always white ; but triangular corner pieces and serrated diamonds are endless in diversity . One color combination is faithfully reproduced in the square of border illustrated . The knitting may proceed in squares afterwards 89 HOMECRAFT RUGS seamed together , or in full border strips . However the sections are knit , it is absolutely imperative that all the pile runs the same way when sections are seamed together . The direction , to be correct , must be from one end of the rug toward the other and never across the rug . This rule is inflexible in all rugcraft . The pattern bears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs . The field of the particular rug from which this border is taken consists of three very large diamonds on a background of indigo blue . The diamonds are bordered with the Greek fret and edged with latch hooks . Large diamonds inclose smaller ones similarly edged . The central diamond has a tarantula in the middle . So conventionalized is this motif seldom absent from certain Caucasian rugs , the Shirvan being of the group , that one unacquainted with Oriental designs would find little resemblance to the spider in it . The two end diamonds have a small square or Greek cross in the middle about which are a few scattered motifs in full or in part of the central unit of design found in the serrated diamond of the border . The same seven border colors are used with similar diversity in the rug field . This description is thus minutely given , for , by following it , a homecraft rug can be fashioned with good results . It is well to include another very simple border to go on each side of the Shirvan border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brown edging a central one of alternate one and one-half-inch squares in red and yellow . The yellow throughout the 90 I KNIT RUGS original rug is light , almost a lemon shade . If this secondary border is omitted , put an inch-wide strip of dark brown on both sides of the Shirvan border . The one remaining type of Smyrna knitting to be considered is the loop-pile , which is as easy to make as either of the others . Each strip or section is begun with one row of plain knitting , and the work proceeds with alternate rows of pile and plain knitting , bringing the pile always on one and the same side . A pile row is knit as follows : Slip the first stitch . Insert the needle in the loop of the next stitch . Wind the pile medium about the needle as in taking a stitch and also about two fingers of the left hand , or a mesh held back of the right-hand needle . Bring the knitting medium over the needle and complete the stitch including the pile strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one in the row , which knit plain . In each plain row of knitting succeeding a pile row , include pile strands as part of each stitch . Loop-pile knitting lends itself particularly well to rugs having plain centers with crosswise border bands of contrasting tones , or to bold patterns in which there are masses of color . It is quite possible , however , to develop any rug pattern though intricate in design , by making loop stitches in colors indicated by a pattern . The pile is firm and can be sheared or left in loops . The cut pile is handsomest , of course . In turning from Smyrna knitting to ravel pile knitting , an entirely different type of construction is found . In this the inherent tendency of knitting to ravel and the 91 HOMECRAFT RUGS elasticity of this craft are the foundation principles . The pile surface is made of inch-wide knitted strips , doubled lengthwise , and both edges sewed simultaneously to a firm foundation textile . If the pile is to be cut , sew the strips three-eighths inch apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop strip and cut along the top . The sheared edges will ravel sufficiently to form a pile surface , but not enough to reach the sewing , which will remain intact . If the pile is uncut , sew the strips a trifle closer , to keep them upright . In olden times , following the custom of using commonplace and familiar terms , these unsheared rugs went by the descriptive but inelegant name of " washboard mats . " The name " fluted pile rug " or " cor rugated rug " is no less accurate , and either is certainly more likable . The former being most pleasing , is here chosen . Ravel pile and fluted pile rugs are apt to be made in bands of color , although they can be made in broad pat-terns , outlined on the foundation textile and then filled 92 KNIT RUGS in with different-colored strips sewed to cover these spaces as the color scheme demands . Unless a design is intro duced the strips on round or oval rugs should be sewed in rows from the center in ever-increasing circumferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands of contrasting color are easily introduced . Rectangular rugs may be started with a center crosswise strip and have strips sewed successively on alternate sides , making the corrugations fol. - lowthe washboard formation . This permits of bands of color across the rug only . A more interesting way is to begin with a strip sewed entirely about the edge as indicated on the foundation , and to sew each succeeding strip just in-side the preceding one , finish-ing with one short straight center strip when there is insufficient space for anything more . With this formation , border bands may extend completely around a rug . When the pile is not sheared the name fluted pile rug is more accurate for this type of construction than is either the washboard or corrugated mat. 93 HOMECRAFT RUGS Ticking , with its straight woven color stripes , is recommended for a foundation textile for rectangular rugs . The stripes serve as guiding lines to insure evenness of rows . Denim is a good choice for round rugs in which the ticking stripes would prove confusing . The shape of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the center of a length of textile , smoothly laid on the floor , and a pencil which is attached to the other end of the string is manipulated like the arm of a pair of compasses . By shortening the string , inner circles of varying circumferences can be marked to indicate borders or to act as guides for sewing on strips . The edges of knit rugs sewed onto foundations can be finished off in three ways . The foundation may be cut one inch wider than the rug , be turned back and felled or hemmed down or bound flat with braid or tape . A rug lining can be fitted under the foundation and the edges of both , cut close to the rugwork , can be bound together . Or both foundation and rug lining can be turned in , and the lining be overcast to the foundation . Smooth-faced rugs do not need to be the nondescript floor coverings usually found . They can be given character by design . This is evidenced by the " Window Box Rug " pictured in Plate X. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out to a marked degree , yet without any attempt to wrest from the stitchery more than lies within its scope . Apart from the artistry of the pattern , the charm of the floor covering lies in the absolute consistency of design and technique , which 941 KNIT RUGS always unite correctly when a craft is satisfactorily developed . There is a suggestion of the modernistic about the rug , despite its conservative treatment . Windowpanes and shutters , flowers and boxes are treated with the reserve of applied design , so superbly carried out in some of the antique Persian garden rugs . A notable feature in this rug is the circular knitting in which the flowers are worked . While this knitting presents no particular difficulties of technique , it is fine needlecraft . The knitting is done on two needles in wedge-shaped formation . The work never altogether leaves the first needle on which the stitches are cast . Always one pivotal stitch remains until a complete circle is fashioned about it . When the one opening from it to the circumference is seamed together an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedge begins with a dark hue , followed by a lighter shade of the same color , there is a petal formation furthering the idea of a flower in full bloom . The wedges of green between the flowers supply the foliage . The elasticity of knitting is taken advantage of in making this floral border , as it permits the foliage wedges to conform to the curved spaces without any special shaping . ( See sampler C , Plate XI . ) A strong point in favor of making this smart floor covering is that all the sections are made separately and can be knit as " pick-up " work , before any of the assembling and sewing starts . Another is that the diversity of colors in flowers affords an excellent chance to use up 95 short lengths of goods . Full directions for making this rug are at the back of the book . A rug made of one large circle of wedge knitting has another of those prosaic names , graphic but utterly lacking in artistic appeal , that is reminiscent of Puritanism . It is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting on a number of stitches equal to half the desired diameter , and sufficient to make the completed circle large enough for a mat . Fifty stitches will be the most a rug maker can manage in rug mediums . In the first row knit off all stitches except the final one . This ( the first stitch cast on ) is always left unknit . Turn the work , and slip the first stitch on the second needle onto the first needle . Put a strand of yarn of a contrasting color between the needles as a marker . Finish the row and knit back again , remembering to leave the stitch next the marker unknit . Turn the work , and slip the first stitch on the second needle onto the first as before . Adjust the marker and continue thus knitting back and forth in continually shortening rows until all the stitches are on the first needle . A new wedge is now begun by knitting all the stitches but the pivotal one onto the second needle , and knitting each succeeding row exactly as when making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential to adjust the marker continually at the hub end of a row , for the wedge formation is invariably made here , and never at the outer edge . The circumference of the circle must never be infringed upon . 96 KNIT RUGS Whatever the size of the circle , it takes twelve of the wedges to complete it . Some workers prefer to leave four stitches unknit rather than to knit them all off when the work is turned to begin a new wedge , thus avoiding much slipping of stitches and turning of work . In large wedge circles this method can be followed satisfactorily , but when circles are small , all stitches should be knit off . When the work is turned to start a new wedge is the time to introduce a dark color to form the spokes of the cartwheel . Several grades of color or rows of contrasting color may be put into a large circular rug of this sort , but the colors must always grow lighter as rows grow smaller , so that the contrast is pronounced when the darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mat should have a narrow band of black strip knitting sewed to the edge . This terminates the radiating lines of a cartwheel rug as definitely as a tire does the spokes of a wagon-wheel . Despite their unbeautiful name , cartwheel rugs have a rhythm and a classic simplicity that lend distinction . They should never be made in hit-or-miss colors , but ever with the gradation of tones described . A full-blown flower can be suggested in a large circular rug of wedge formation . Choose three or four shades of one floral color . Start the wedge with the deepest , and work toward the lightest at the finish of the wedge . Re-peat this petal scheme throughout all wedges . Substitute a band of green for the black strip of knitting to edge the rug , thereby suggesting foliage . In a bedroom a mat 97 HOMECRAFT RUGS of this sort carrying out some color of flower in a wallpaper or border or some flower in drapery fabrics would have the charm of novelty to enhance that of the rug itself . The fundamental elasticity of knitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strip knitting . Each strip forms one band completely encircling the rug , and therefore strips are of increasing length as the size of the rug increases . For a round rug , the central strip is just long enough to form a complete circle along the outer edge when the inner one is gathered tight . It must neither cup nor ripple . A round rug may have the center a circle of wedge knitting instead of a gathered strip . The center of an oval rug is made precisely like an oval braided rug ( see page 41 ) . Strips may be uniform , or some may be wider than others . When widths vary , rugs are more interesting . A handsome oval rug is made by surrounding a central row of wedge circles with many rows of strip knitting , then inserting a border of wedge circles and surrounding these with one or more rows of strip knitting . Knit rugs with plain centers and geometric borders are smart . They appear complicated in construction , but in reality are easy to fashion . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book . The design may be in black , a sharply contrasting tone of the same color as the field of the rug , or in some darker harmonious tone . Suggested color schemes are light sage-green field 98 KNIT RUGS with deep sage design , or black ; old blue with black ; grey or tan in two tones or with old rose or some other gay color for the design . An attractive knit rug is made of two-inch color squares so arranged that the hues , besides being in contrast to each other , form a geometric design of ever-widening squares or diamonds surrounding a small one diagonally placed in the center . For schemes of arrangements of this sort , see the diagrams of plans for Fabric Mosaic Rugs on page 247 . An occasional row of black may accent the color scheme advantageously . The knitting can proceed in strips two inches wide or four , six , or eight inches wide . The colors should be correctly introduced so that the strips when seamed together carry out the pattern plan . Begin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black of corresponding width down each side of the rug and a complete border will result . Smooth-face knit rugs can be made of very heavy rug yarn , rope jute , either cotton or wool roving , candlewick , stockings , or strips of cloth , new or old . If of cloth , the strands may be cut on the bias or on the straight of the goods according to the preference of the individual worker . Bias strips are favored because their elasticity is akin to that of yarn . On the other hand , straight strips are favored because they can be prepared quickly , if the cloth is new or strong , by tearing the strands , in the width desired . While this is rapid work , the writer prefers cut strands because smooth , flat edges , not curly ones , result . The width best for knitting strands entirely depends 99I HOMECRAFT RUGS upon the textile . Ordinary cotton cloth is generally cut ( or torn ) one inch wide . But , again , very heavy outingflannel as narrow as one-quarter inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessitates an extra-heavy textile , however . It is wise to consider the one-inch cotton goods a standard gage and to cut sheer textiles wider , and heavy ones narrower , to approximate it . Outing-flannel is an excellent textile for knitted rug strands . The knitting stitch should be reasonably tight . An actually loose stitch makes a flimsy rug , but too tight a stitch tends to tire the hands of the rug maker . Use a stitch tension that is congenial to the size of the needle and the medium , and which is found easy to work . Pile knit strips and units are sewed together on the wrong side . Put two right sides together , and overhand the edges twice , one stitch crossing the other diagonally as in sewing breadths of carpet together . The stitches are invisible on the right side . The pile conceals them . If smooth-face units are neatly seamed together on the wrong side with carpet thread closely matching the rug colors , the stitches should not show on the right side , nor be easily detected on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The several types of knit rugs described are sufficient to prove the possibilities of the craft in the realm of rugmaking , and to indicate the lines along which individuality can find expression . In all the rugs mentioned , design and technique , stitch and style have been welded to form fine types . For this ioo KNIT RUGS reason the hit-or-miss smooth-face knit rugs , put together in strips , have not been considered . There is nothing to recommend them , and they have been responsible , in large measure , for the poor esteem in which , until very recently , the knit rug has been held . They do not deserve perpetuation . Thrift can scarcely be urged as a reason for fashioning them , since many other ways of using up odds and ends of material have been given . No less time is needed for their construction , and they are not one whit more practical than artistic rugs . Fortunately , in modern knit rugs opportunities for instilling beauty have been seized upon , and it is only such floor coverings that homecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUGS PART I INSPIRATION AND DEVELOPMENT Though crocheted rugs are a late contribution to floor coverings , the ancestry of the stitch which composes them is old beyond computation . Known as crochet for a few hundred years only , as chain-stitch it reverts to remote ages in such forms as " tambour work , " and link-stitch embroidery wrought with a needle through a fabric . It was only when chain-stitch became sufficient unto itself , and apart from a fabric foundation , that it assumed its present guise and became an agent of manual expression , suited to rugcraft . In its new phase of evolution the stitch itself remains identical . The rugs can be full of the spirit of the Orient , harking back to the period when the stitchery was known in another form , or they can be so embued with the spirit of modernity that their novelty is in unison with the youthfulness of the craft , which is the last to be directed to the making of floor coverings . Crocheted rugs can be made with a smooth-faced surface or with a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one tool , a crochet hook or needle . To these finishes can be added the corrugated or fluted and the embossed 102 CROCHETED RUGS surfaces , fashioned by manipulating the units after they have been crocheted . The craft of crocheting is a modest one , yet second to none in point of popularity . The rhythm and simplicity of the technique combine to set the stamp of favor upon it , as well as the sense that a rug is entirely completed with the taking of the final crochet stitch . Binding , lining , or other finishing is not necessary . The one exception to this is found in those rugs in which units are crocheted separately and assembled to complete the whole , as seen in the quaint lozenge rugs of olden times , but more especially in ultra-modern types . The amazing rapidity with which crocheting develops , particularly in the coarse mediums suited to rub craft , scores another point in its favor , especially as none of the beauty of the completed rug is sacrificed . Mistakes can be detected quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , since no frame or loom is used . It is no wonder that crocheted floor coverings find so large a number of interested craftsmen . The first mention of crochet is in the sixteenth century , when it is recorded as being done in Europe , but in so slight a way as to make little impression upon needlecraft of that era . The date given may indicate the approximate time when crocheting originated , or it may merely signify its appearance in laces , the making of which was an engrossing occupation of needlewomen , especially in Italy and Spain . It is certain that , at present , no examples of crochet before that period are extant , nor // any previous word about the craft as apart from the stitchery of embroidery done with a hook . According to present knowledge , crochet first appeared and came to us through laces . It is interesting to note that , even up to the last quarter of the nineteenth century , chain-stitch was being done on a fabric with a hook as well as a needle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of time , the transition from an embroidery to a separate craft seems entirely natural . Not until three hundred years after its first appearance , did crochet come to the forefront of stitchery as a loop-woven textile . Its travels , meantime , had led into many a convent , where it went by the name of " nun 's work " ; into Ireland , where it still lingers in the famed Irish point or Honiton lace , as important in the craft as the guipures of Spain ; to America , where , less than a hundred years ago , it became an agent in the construction of floor coverings . It takes some stretch of the imagination to bridge the distance between the delicate crocheted laces , and sturdy crocheted rugs which followed the vogue for crocheted capes , shawls and couvrepieds , or afghans , as they were more commonly called , deriving their name from the " Afghan stitch " by which they were constructed . In the last-named article was the closest counterpart to the crocheted rug , and Afghan stitch , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to rugcraft . Fitting indeed that it should be , for it takes us back to 104 CROCHETED RUGS the Orient , home of rug making . It is from Herat , the capital of Afghanistan , that the famous Herati rugs come ; also the design which bears the name of that city and is one of the best known rug patterns . But it is not alone through this stitch that crochet has an Oriental flavor . One specific style of work in Russian stitch bears the name " Oriental crochet " interchangeably with that of " tapestry crochet . " In this ingenious work , embodying all the fascination of color to be found in cross stitch and embroidered tapestry rugs , lies an almost untouched field in rugcraft . It presents an extraordinary opportunity to develop the finest kind of smoothfaced crocheted rugs with every appearance of complicated stitchery , yet minus technical difficulties . Colors can be introduced at will to accord with the requirements of an intricate pattern . There is the conciseness of cross stitch and precision of tapestry , coupled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color can be discarded for another as easily as if an embroidery needle were the tool , instead of a crochet needle . Ends do not have to be fastened off immediately . They are allowed to hang from the back of the work I05 HOMECRAFT RUGS until again needed . If not required for several rows , or not in sufficiently close proximity to be brought readily to the new part of the crochet , the yarn is cut and the end left shaggy as in genuine Oriental Shemakha rugs . Wherever the color is called for in the pattern again , it can be inserted anew as easily as if continuing with the color already on the needle . The facility with which stitchery and design can be brought into unison in crochet is exemplified in the ship rug pictured . It is no more difficult to work than as if in hooked rugcraft . In crochet it is unique . It is in Oriental or tapestry crochet that this ship rug is wrought . It can be seen at a glance that there is no restriction as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beyond that which pertains to stitch formation . This is characteristic , not alone of crochet , but of all textiles , however fashioned , where pattern is brought out in the weave . ( The ship rug is shown in color on Plate II . ) The rug bears a design of " Old Ironsides " originated in crochet by the illustrator to fill an increasing demand in this renaissance of ships in handicraft . Many sailing vessels built in America have been depicted on hooked rugs , but this is the first venture of such in crochet rugcraft . " Old Ironsides " is a welcome leader of this fleet . This frigate of high destiny , the first ship to sail under the United States War Department , was christened the Constitution , but given the endearing title of " Old Ironsides " for her valiant service . As here depicted , the vessel is sailing a tranquil sea , under pleasant twilight skies . io6 CROCHETED RUGS Her sails swell in the breeze , and flags and pennants are flying . The rug belongs distinctly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the design admirably suited to a wall hanging in either crochet or cross stitch . For this , or for the lining of a glass tray , a fine yarn such as Germantown or tapestry should be chosen . The rug is done to scale , three stitches to the inch , as rag crochet strands , in one inch width , work up , or threeply jute , as well as the extra-heavy rug yarns . The size of the rug , therefore , is four feet three inches by three feet . The colors are soft and unobtrusive , yet the gallant frigate stands out proudly . The border of the interlocking wave motifs is delightfully consistent , adding another marine unit , while the outer border in wood tone encloses the picture as if framed in weather driftwood . Russian stitch ( see page 119 ) is used in developing the rug . This is a plain crochet , always worked in one direction , as is customary in Oriental crochet . When a contrasting color is introduced , it starts invariably in the final loop of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . This smooth-faced rug surface is uninterrupted , and uniform in textile formation . No knots are required in the work , nor do loose ends ever appear on the right side , but are always left hanging on the wrong . Full directions for making will be found at the back of the book , as the reduced size of the illustration makes it somewhat difficult to discern the cross bars that designate stitches as in cross stitch patterns . 107 HOMECRAFT RUGS It may be added that the rug can be carried out in cross stitch by following the same color directions . The size of the rug will then depend entirely upon the size of the canvas mesh . If that having four holes to an inch is employed , the rug will be approximately two feet by three feet four inches . While rug yarns would naturally be selected for this work , it is possible , when doing it on the coarsest canvas , to use rag strands one-quarter or onehalf inch wide . Those cut from silk stockings lend themselves well . Simple color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out in Afghan stitch . This crochet is always worked on the right side , without being turned ? an essential not to be overlooked . The rows are worked back and forth and not invariably in one direction , as in tapestry crochet and it takes two " journeys " or rows to complete each stitch ( see Plate III ) . This must be remembered , for in introducing color , it has to be started in the loop row and be finished in the chain row . As Afghan stitch is worked in strips , designs are generally somewhat simpler than in tapestry crochet . Strips can be joined with the precision of breadths of carpets , making patterns match exactly . A duplex or tri-color tapestry ( Oriental crochet ) is used when not more than three colors are required . In this work , the color or colors not in use form the filler over which the crocheting is done . Each new color is introduced from the filler as required by the pattern , and must commence in the final loop of the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes its place as filler . Always take up both loops of the stitch in the preceding row ( rose stitch ) . The strands not in use are disposed of invisibly when worked over . Tri-color tapestry crochet can be used to add decoration to otherwise plain crocheted rugs by having such borders worked at each end . The design can be taken from the wallpaper of the room for which it is intended , or from a cretonne , chintz , or other ornamental textile , not to mention some embroidered design used in the decorative scheme of the room . A small motif should be selected , for it will be greatly enlarged in rugcraft owing to the size of the stitch . By squaring off a pattern by cross lines , each square being equal to one third or one quarter inch to accord with the size of a stitch in rag or rug yarn mediums , it is easy to know the exact enlargement . One motif can be crocheted in repetition throughout a border strip , variety being instilled by the shading ; or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different color . This is a favorite method with Oriental rug makers . When these rugs are developed in chambray , using grey , sage-green , ecru , orchid , etc. , to give the plain toned field , and the shades in the tapestry border strip are in artistic harmony , the rugs are similar to the familiar power-loom style popular for bedrooms , bathrooms , nurseries , etc. , and on which patterns are stenciled . These loom rugs are sometimes called pictorial , or floral rag rugs , according to the type of pattern imprinted . The cost is little or nothing according to the medium employed . If // new cloth or candlewick is used , a trifling cost is involved . If the material from discarded summer frocks and house dresses is the medium , the cost is nothing . The simplest form of two-color crochet is the warpand-weft in which the filler ( weft ) is visible . In it no pattern is introduced . The decorative element in such rugs consists of color contrasts glimpsed through the mesh of stitchery . To increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken between each plain crochet stitch . Colored twine and jute are excellent warp mediums . The string is worked over a strip of cambric one and three-quarters inches wide , and folded to a width of one half inch . As the crocheting progresses over it , the goods crushes , until it is actually but one quarter inch wide . A heavier filler or weft should be cut narrower . Any tub material can be used for wash rugs . They launder best when string is the warp . Considering the simplicity of workmanship , these rugs are surprisingly decorative and are very economical . They are recommended for kitchen rugs , and simple summer cottages . These floor coverings can also be developed in woolen rags and yarn . Another style of the warp-and-weft rug is made with the primary medium concealed . When this is the case , the filler is used to supply extra thickness . The medium for the actual stitchery should be somewhat narrower than that for ordinary crocheted rugs . A width of one-half inch is sufficient , and one-quarter inch if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into plain crocheting that is worked continuously , merely by discarding one color and taking up another without crocheting over the unwanted strand except for the distance required by the motif . This method is frequently employed when some very small motif is introduced into a rug field otherwise solid in color . The arrowhead is a good example of a motif to be used thus ( see Plate XI ) ; so also are the diamond , triangle and hour-glass motifs , the Greek cross , swastika , and innumerable other separate motifs . Material is conserved when motifs are introduced thus , although it can only be done satisfactorily when they are few and far between . Loose ends of medium must be carefully interwoven through the stitchery to dispose of them neatly . If they are laced around strands of their own color , they can be concealed best . Designs will be clear-cut only if , when changing color , the new one is used to complete the stitch just preceding . This can be done by using the new color for the final loop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work crochet . The rug maker who once uses color work crochet will soon find herself copying Oriental motifs direct from rugs , from cross stitch patterns , bead work designs , etc . A whole new range of rug possibilities in the craft of crochet is revealed . When colors and patterns are Oriental , and the rugs are made in heavy strands of woolen textile , or heavy woolen yarn , they become choice examples of crocheted homecraft rugs . This also is true III HOMECRAFT RUGS when quaint old types of patterns are revived as in the ship rug pictured . The use of pattern in crocheted rugs is by no means confined to the styles of work described . It is a feature of crocheted rugs in general , but in none can the intricacy of pattern be developed through an indefinite number of tones , as in Oriental crochet wrought in Russian stitch . Two- and three-color tapestry crochet come next in color possibilities capable of development in smooth-faced rug surfaces . In pile crochet , another style of rug and method of employing color arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs characteristic of Afghan carpets are worked into homecraft rugs in Oriental crochet , there is a result highly consistent . To promote this similarity , use Turkoman ( blood ) red for the field background . This is a deep dull red . Have the motifs in rich blue , brownish yellow ( or deep orange ) or a very deep ivory or pale amber . They may be further accented and made more typical by outlining in dark brown . All these colors should be combined in one rug . In the Herati motifs , an entirely different type is ap parent . Notwithstanding the fact that Herat is the capital of Afghanistan , the rugs bearing the name are distinctly Persian in pattern . The situation of this city is so close to the Persian border that it is accountable for the trend . The Herati motif , known as the fish or twin fish because of its resemblance to the sea creatures , is so popular that it is said to appear in some one of its adapted forms in ap 112 CROCHETED RUGS proximately half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been modified to suit crochet . Each square represents one crochet stitch . The pear motif is almost as popular , and is known by innumerable names , such as river loop , crown jewel , flame , etc . In Herati carpets all the stems in every row turn in the same direction . By changing the direction of the stems in alternate rows , Saraband , and Shiraz characteristics prevail . Whatever the slant of the mo 113 HOMECRAFT RUGS tif , the stem is invariably toward the top of the rug . In adapting patterns which form such a strong feature of crocheted rugs , basketry will be found a fertile source of inspiration . Fascinating patterns can be taken directly from baskets woven by the Amerinds . The aboriginal American Indians living in the Stone Age , and never advancing far enough in civilization to construct crude looms for weaving , yet made baskets of fine workmanship . When design entered into the Indian baskets , it had the conventional elements so desirable in floor coverings . The oval and round shapes of flat baskets offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply both shape and designs without alteration being necessary . ( See Plate XV . ) The picturesque patterns found in Peruvian and old Inca textiles lend themselves remarkably to rug making . Designs can be taken off on cross-bar draughting paper . The novice may find it wise to use this paper to take off basketry patterns that are at all intricate . It may be added that , in crochet adaptations made from baskets , there is found a relative quality in the stitchery that is in close parallel . Ancient beadwork designs are also excellent to use in rug patterns . Cross stitch , ancient and modern , can be wrought in crochet , since one stitch occupies a space approximating a cross stitch . Filet patterns can also be used , if each square of crochet is reckoned as occupying that of a " block " or " space " and no openwork is made . To bring out the pattern , " blocks " must be done in color // against a contrasting background , corresponding to the " spaces . " In cross stitch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out those suited to rugcraft , as so many are intended for dainty embroideries or lacework , rather than for stout floor coverings . The size of the crochet stitch must be remembered ( two to four to an inch ) as it greatly magnifies the pattern . Silhouette crochet rugs are in line with the fashion for this style in rugcraft . Nothing is much easier than to copy patterns in this two-color work . A printed silhouette can be squared off as previously described , and a rug pattern result . Or some pattern brought out for cross stitch , as for example the one on page 183 , can be followed in crochet . It is so usual for women to design their own crocheted rugs that special attention has been given to suggesting interesting avenues for inspiration , and ways and means of using data so acquired . Another opportunity for fashioning attractive rugs is found in the use of applique motifs whereby an ornamental embossed effect is achieved . Still another way is by the assembling of separate units , as found in the quaint lozenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present time ( see sampler E on Plate XI ) . The rug composed of separate units is a kind well adapted to carpet-size floor coverings . These can be made in any dimensions . In all the rugs previously described , little mention has been made of any but smooth-faced surfaces . An entirely new type of crocheted rug comes to light in pile crochet . In these rugs design is brought out , as in Smyrna knit pile , 115 HOMECRAFT RUGS the only difference being that plain crochet is used as a foundation instead of knitting . The crocheted pile can be composed of separate short lengths of medium , and any color can be used independently , as in knot pile carpets . Or a loop pile of a continuous length of medium can be introduced as in the second type of pile knitting . Ravel pile knitting can not be simulated in crochet . It belongs solely to knitting . The technique of pile crochet is explained fully in the latter part of this chapter . As the introduction of design in pile crochet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat it . By thus cutting short the account of the work , it must not be understood that it lacks significance in rugcraft , but that directions can be found elsewhere in the book . Those who prefer the craft of crochet to that of its sister craft , knitting , will find that crochet lends itself admirably to the making of pile rugs in intricate or simple patterns . PART II TOOL , STITCHES AND MEDIUMS The crochet hook is the sole tool and equipment used in the making of crocheted rugs . It should be sufficiently large to be congenial to the medium which is coarse . It should also be light and strong . Aluminum hooks are lightest , though wooden and bone hooks are generally 116 CROCHETED RUGS employed . An extra-large hook comes in wood . Steel , the best for fine crocheting , is too heavy for large needles and is not made in sizes suited to rugcraft . It is from the tool that the craft of crochet gets its name . The word , which comes in French from croche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words crook and hook . The highly polished and finely finished crochet hooks of to-day are but improvements on the original sewing needle of prehistoric times , which is described as a rude bodkin having a hook instead of an eye . With it , fibrous tendrils and threads were poked and pulled through a textile . So admirably is the hooked needle suited to rug making that it is frequently appropriated for other rugcrafts besides crocheting , notably hooked rug work and certain kinds of knot-tied pile . The rug hook used is nothing more nor less than an enlarged crochet hook of the type used in tambour work . It is with the hooked needle in large size and having a short shank that most crocheted rugs are made , and it is this sort of needle that is requisitioned for other crafts . The needle with a long shank and balltipped at the end opposite the hook is required for rugs made in Afghan stitch . This long needle is necessary because , as in knitting , all stitches are cast onto one needle . Indeed in Afghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sister craft , knitting , is emphasized . It is a veritable knitting with one needle , though it would be a task to do without the aid of the croche in the needle . So closely u7 // allied are the two crafts that crochet is now classified as " knitting work done with a hook instead of with pins " ? as the needles are also called . From the fact that the stitch evolved from embroidery and is also akin to knitting , it will be seen that crocheting holds an intriguing position between the two crafts , coupling distinct characteristics of embroidery and knitting , through the one item of stitch formation which is equally chain and loop . It is with great effect that these can be employed in rug making . Crochet stitch , in whatever different form it appears , is never anything but a loop or a succession of loops drawn through one or more other loops . Variety is gained in the method these loops are taken , the number of " overs " ( times that the thread is put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn through the crocheted material already made . By such means , a close , open , or lace stitchery is formed , the latter by skipping stitches . Close crochet should be used for rugcraft . It supplies a firm , uninterrupted weave capable of withstanding hard wear . It consists of stitches without " overs , " taken in sequence through each stitch in a preceding row . There are many kinds of close crochet stitches , five of which are particularly suited to crocheted rugcraft , because of their strength and simplicity . These are rose stitch ( often called plain crochet ) , Russian stitch , pique , half treble , and Afghan . In order to facilitate homecraft rug making , explicit directions for each will be given . All rugs are begun with chain-stitches , so named be 118 CROCHETED RUGS cause each stitch is a link of connection with the preceding and following stitch . The chain so fashioned may form a length determining the width of a rug , or section of a rug ; or the ends of the chain may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hexagonal , etc. , floor covering . Rose stitch is the one most commonly used in rug making . The only difference between it and plain crochet is that the needle is put under both loops of the stitch in a preceding row instead of under the top loop merely . As will be seen , rose stitch is thereby made stronger than plain crochet , with which it is frequently confused . Russian stitch is rose stitch always worked in one direction . In round and oval rugs it would therefore not differ in any way . It is when the work necessitates turning to traverse back and forth , as in rectangular and square rugs and in runners , that the change is imperative . In each instance the work has a decided right and wrong side . In Russian stitch each row progresses from right to left , the medium being caught through a loop in the first stitch at the right , and being finished in the final stitch at the left after which the medium is cut and the end drawn through the final loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does no other to certain kinds of crocheting , conspicuous among which is Oriental tapestry crochet instanced in the foregoing chapter in the ship rug . Pique stitch differs from Russian stitch in one particular only . The needle is inserted under the vertical strand of the stitch in the preceding row . The appearance of the H9 HOMECRAFT RUGS work is totally different , however , for it has a braided effect on the wrong side , which generally is used as the right when the work is completed . Needless to say , since it is likened to Russian stitch the crocheting always progresses from right to left , unless the work is done in one continuous " journey , " as in round and oval rugs . Half treble , although strictly speaking not a close stitch according to the definition , since it does have one " over , " is so compact , notwithstanding , that it actually is close , and therefore well adapted to rugcraft . In taking the stitch , before inserting the needle in the interstice between two stitches in a preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle which is then put through the work as described . A loop of the medium is caught and drawn through the work , caught again and drawn through all three loops on the shank of the needle . The only other stitch requiring directions is Afghan stitch , conceded to be the easiest of all crochet stitches . For this reason it has earned the name of " idiot 's stitch " and " fool 's stitch , " requiring no mental acumen whatever to fashion . It is well to speak of this , for , as it is worked in two " journeys , " it takes longer to describe than any of the others . It is akin to knitting , and also must be made in strips or sections and then sewed together to form a rug . It supplies an extra-firm weave , however . ( See Plates III and V , bottom sampler . ) Make a chain the desired length . Through the second stitch from the needle , and each succeeding stitch of the chain , draw a loop of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shank of the needle . This casting on of stitches is done in every alternate row , which is termed the " loop " row . In other alternate rows the stitches are cast off as follows : catch the medium with the needle and draw it through one stitch , catch it again and draw it through two stitches . Continue ( in all but the first stitch ) to catch the medium and draw it through two loops . At the final stitch in the row all the stitches , but a single loop , will have been " knit " off the crochet needle . In the third and each succeeding loop row , insert the needle under the vertical line of the stitch in the preceding row . These vertical lines are so clearly visible in the crochet that it has acquired the name of " railroad crochet . " Three significant names for this stitch having been given , two others of historical value may be mentioned : one , " Victorian crochet , " denoting the reign in which it was originated ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of its appearance even more precisely . It was given the names except one , " tricot stitch , " there is purport , but it is in " Afghan stitch " that its alliance to rugcraft is notable . Afghan stitch is always worked on the right side , but in such a way that it progresses in alternate directions without breaking the medium . Rugs in this stitch are rectangular or square , never circular or oval . Oriental or tapestry crochet employs no stitch peculiar to itself as apart from other rugcraft crochet , as does Afghan work , yet it is distinctive , as has been instanced . I2I HOMECRAFT RUGS It is simply one form of plain close crochet , known as Russian stitch . It is entitled to the names Oriental or tapestry crochet only when many colors are wrought into the stitchery , thereby instilling pictorial or patterned elements reflecting tapestry characteristics or suggesting Oriental stitchery . Fortunately this is as easy to accomplish in crochet as in color embroidery . To facilitate the work it is wise to wind each color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevents the strands from getting tangled . The balls must be light , so that they do not drag on the stitchery . When colors are used up before the requirements of the pattern , new balls of like color should be added . As the work progresses , the loose ends dangling from the back of the work should be fastened off securely by running them in a weaving fashion through the back of the stitches . There is no occasion for the tips of the medium to be entirely concealed . They are on the wrong side , and can be left slightly shaggy , once the stitches are tight . Tapestry weaves and embroidery are thus uneven , and likewise Shemakha rugs , which are a type of genuine Oriental tapestry . The mediums best suited to crocheted rugs are yarns , rags , jute in both yarn and rope sizes , and wool and cotton roving , which , for rug making , comes slightly twisted and is given the name of rug yarn , although there are far finer wool rug yarns than these . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crochet medium ) , ravelings from carpets and also from knitted and crocheted articles , stockings , twine , string , clothesline , 1221 CROCHETED RUGS and woven silk cut into strips . Twine , string and clothesline are used in conjunction with other mediums . The first two are used for stitchery over the last or over folded bands of textile about one-half inch wide ( after it is turned in at each side and down the center ) . The last , as a filler , is apt to be entirely concealed , though sometimes it is glimpsed between stitches . It supplies great durability and adds extra thickness . It can be made an ornamental element when crocheted over in a contrasting color of coarse string or jute . Silk is ill-adapted to crocheted rugs in flat weave , and but little more so in pile rugs . It is too delicate a textile . It is true that there is precedent for silk rugs , as instanced in choice Oriental carpets , but these are knot pile and of silken threads , not strips of a fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silk Oriental carpets most frequently found in Chinese floor coverings were , and still are , especially reserved for rugs in mosques , temples and palaces , and for wall hangings , and were never intended to stand the tread of boots and shoes . The width of rag strips for crocheting rugs may vary from one-half inch to one inch , or even more if the textile is very sheer . The difference may be due to the type of rug being fashioned or the rug maker 's preference . One inch is the accepted width , however , for flat close stitch , the one-half inch width being practical in very few cases . The medium may be folded and pressed to conceal raw edges , or it may be used without any attempt to conceal the raw edges . The tips of threads that fray in most fab-123 HOMECRAFT RUGS rics will soon wear off when the rug is used , and the stitchery is such that further fraying is not encouraged . The material may be cut bias or straight ; preferably the lengthwise , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that knit goods when used for rug strands is used on the wrong side because of the natural tendency of the material to curl over the right side leav ing only the wrong side exposed . By so doing a sort of rug yarn strand is formed which lends itself admirably to rugcraft . The wrong side is equally as attractive as the right for this purpose . Goods of different weights that are used together must be so cut that the width of each supplies strands of ap proximately the same size . For example if the width chosen is one inch to suit the majority of the cloth , that which is heavier must be cut somewhat narrower and that thinner must be cut wider . It is only when the ma terials combined are in strands of the same size that a rug can be well constructed . This is the first essential . The embossed crocheted rug is a distinctly modern floor covering made only in recent years or in such exceptional earlier instances as to leave no impression on the rugcraft . The embossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of plain crochet ing . There is no reason for restricting these rugs to any special medium , for they can be developed in one as well as another . Nevertheless , so far jute has proved the prime favorite , few rugs being made except in it . For this reason full directions are relegated to the chapter on jute floor 124 CROCHETED RUGS coverings . In that chapter will be found many other types of crocheted rugs which also can be developed in other mediums . They are given in the jute category because especially well adapted to porch rugs , and for them jute is chosen as most nearly akin to grass and fiber , popular for porches . In turning from the crocheted rugs developed in flat stitchery to those made with a pile , it will be found that both looped and cut pile can be fashioned easily . Loop pile is made by winding the medium over the forefinger , or about a flat strip of wood or metal , technically known as a " mesh , " and catching the loop so formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crochet needle is first inserted under both loops of the stitch in a preceding row ( rose stitch ) , then the medium is brought down under and about the mesh , caught by the needle , and then the stitch is completed . Only an expert should work without the mesh , for although it is quite possible to form the loop about the forefinger , it is not so easy . Every other row should be in plain and every alternate one in loop stitch , for thus only can the loops all be on the same side ? unless Russian stitch is used . In this , worked always from right to left , each row can be loop , and a much closer pile result . Cut pile is made by doubling a bit of medium , either yarn or fabric cut one-quarter inch wide and one or one and one-quarter inches long , and catching the loop with the hook inserted under both loops of a stitch in a preceding row , and then completing the stitch . The one and // one-quarter inch length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit in forming the stitch and a one-half inch pile is a good depth . As each pile stitch is an entirely separate unit , copying designs in any of the various methods described is no trouble whatsoever . The pile stitches must come on one side of the work only , either in alternate rows or in succeeding ones in the Russian stitch method . When the medium is fine yarn , use more than one strand for either the loop or cut pile . In the loop pile the medium would have to be wound twice around the " mesh " instead of but once . The stitchery of crocheted rugs , whether in flat or pile surfaces , is never anything but simple and easy . If patterns are correctly chosen and mediums conform to the type of rug being developed , rugs can be handsome as well as practical . Those described in the present chapter are especially intended for use within the house . In the chapter on jute rugs those for porches and sun parlors are given . This does not mean that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor that all rugs noted in the jute chapter are barred from indoor use . The India drugget , for instance , naturally comes under rugs made of jute , but candlewick may also be used , and in either style the rug can be used indoors or out . It is for the rug maker to suit the stitch to the style , and the style to the purpose . 126 VIII RUGS OF JUTE YARN Jute yarn is a modern needlecraft medium especially well suited to rugs for porches , verandas , sun parlors and simple summer cottages . It supplies floor coverings corresponding to those made from fiber , straw , and grass , from which the smart modern rugs intended for these same purposes are fashioned . It is a loosely twisted " mail bundle twine " that was brought out about 1921 , in a wide range of colors and in a twist and texture which , if a bit wirey , is sufficiently supple and similar to warrant the name jute yarn . It proved from the very first to be remarkably well adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope yarn ( a slightly twisted roving ) are best for this use . No new craft is employed and the medium can be substituted for others to suit the type of rug being made . There is nothing new about jute itself , for it has been known for centuries , under the name of pot , but it was not until 1746 that it became known outside of India in jute rope . Since that time it has become so important a factor in rope , twine and even in textile manufacturing , that it has a recognized rank with hemp , for the first two purposes , and with flax and cotton for the last , although in a far lower scale of value . It will be apparent from this summary that it is a decidedly unpretentious medium in 127 HOMECRAFT RUGS rugcraft , having its place , as mentioned , with grass , fiber , etc . It is important , however , in its potentiality since it supplies a medium for making rugs of a distinct type impossible hitherto in a homecraft product . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rug making are crocheting , hooking and braiding . These are named in the order of precedence . The technique of construction can be found in the chapters on these crafts , but some special rugs that are at their best when developed in jute will be given in this chapter together with directions for their making . It lies in the discretion of the rug maker whether she makes the rugs in jute or another medium , however , for several other materials lend themselves admirably , such as rags , candlewick , etc . The four crocheted rugs that stand out as especially interesting are the India drugget replica , the embossed rug , the fancy grass replica and the tessellated rug . The first two are as much for indoors as out , while the last two are more appropriate to sun porches , verandas , etc. , ? sheltered out-of-door places in which decorative schemes are carried out more or less extensively . The India drugget replica is a unique jute rug consistent in character with the medium which comes largely from Calcutta , India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer from a genuine India drugget . It is in duplex crochet , the simplified tapestry work described elsewhere . The colors are crimson and black , the red of the jute yarn corresponding almost exactly to I28 RUGS OF JUTE YARN the shade characteristic of this meander in India druggets . Its combination with black is necessary to be true to type . The plain field of natural colored jute is in the nearest tone to that found in India druggets that can be had in the medium . It is sufficiently near for the rug to be an excellent duplication of the genuine in color and character . It can be used appropriately wherever an India drugget would be . The embossed rug in crochet is distinctly modern . It consists of a plain field with a contrasting border . On the field are sewed separately crocheted motifs , arranged to form a design , which may almost conceal the background or cover but a small portion of it . Color contrast plays a large part in the rugs of either style . For instance , a rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have a round flat modernistic flower in old blue , with a few rows of deep yellow for a center , while from the edges of the flower extend frond-shaped leaves that reach their tapering tips to the border . In this the field is almost concealed . Or an oval rug with a green field and black border may have three circular deep yellow discs , with the centers of brown ( to simulate ox-eyed daisies ) , arranged in a row in the middle of the rug . Between them and the black border , four or six butterflies may be arranged , the number varying to suit the size of the rug . These scattered motifs leave much of the field background visible . Floral motifs comprise the chief units to be appliqued in these embossed rugs , which may as readily be 129 HOMECRAFT RUGS developed in rags , etc. , as jute , but at the present time the latter medium is popular . Jute rugs reproducing effects found in the modern colorful and ornamental grass types , have the motifs made separately and assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverings . Flowers are of the modernistic disc sort , all in one color or with centers contrasting . Foliage is formed of elongated oval leaves , while buds are smaller ovals tipped with a deep tone of the flower hue . Shapes of flowers , leaves and buds may be varied at the will of the rug maker who wishes to follow nature more closely , but the customary formation is given . Any of the smart grass rugs can be copied or the rug maker can do her own designing . A plain field is advised because the rug is easier to fashion and is also more durable . One or more borders can be used to suit the size of the floor covering , although one is sufficient . There must always be an outer border of plain crochet several inches wide to inclose the ornamental one . The plain band may be in the field color , or black . Or it may be in the former with a pin-line of black at the inner and outer edges . The rug maker who makes her own patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the professional method . There are women who prefer , however , to make the rug field , and then crochet as many sets of motifs as will be needed to surround it . Any slight discrepancies in the length of the ornamental border and the circumference of the rug field can be adjusted ( until fitting together is 13 ? 1 RUGS OF JUTE YARN correct ) by raveling out a few rows , if the field is too large or by crocheting a few extra rows if it is too small . The rug maker should crochet a full set of motifs and make her arrangement of them first , and then crochet as many sets as will fit about the rug . Care must be taken to have the units fit together as closely as possible , so that the interstices will be small , as is the case in the grass rugs made for commercial purposes . The shape of these ornamental rugs is generally oval or round . The sizes vary from door-mats to those big enough to carpet a large sun parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these , borders come at each end only . If the rug is square the border encloses the field , as in the round and oval shapes . Tessellated grass and fiber rugs are among the modern porch rugs that lend themselves remarkably to reproduction in jute . They consist of separate squares of natural colored fiber used alone or alternately with some one other color , such as brown , green , blue or black . The squares may measure from twelve to twenty inches . The direction of the stitchery supplies a decorative element clearly defining squares even when all are of a like color . It is an easy matter to make these rugs , for no section is very large and the work can be " pick-up work " as portable as any other needlework . The finished rugs have a dignified smartness . ( See Plate XI . ) To form a square , make a chain of four and join into a ring . Chain one and into the next stitch in the chain make two close stitches . Into each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three close stitches . Into the stitch having but two stitches make another close stitch . This finishes the first row . Make a slip stitch at the finish of the row and start the next row precisely as the first , with a chain of one and then two close stitches in the slip stitch . Crochet three close stitches in the middle stitch of each of the groups of the first row , and one in all of the other stitches . Finish the row as the first row . Make each succeeding row similarly , always making three stitches in the middle stitch in the group of three in the preceding row , thus securing regular and even corners . The Lozenge rug is an old-time rag floor covering . It is similar to the tessellated rug in that units are made separately , but it is of an entirely different character otherwise . Each lozenge , generally hexagonal , is fitted to those next it and crocheted in position . No two are necessarily precisely alike in colors , but a scheme should prevail , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter outside rows ; or light centers with dark outside rows and brilliant tones in bands between . Black is used for crocheting motifs together thus giving each a distinct outline . Such lozenge rugs are pre-eminently economical , as scraps of textiles or yarn can be used advantageously . It is only when color contrasts are artistic , however , that the rug is worthy . By a careful selection of tones , preferably few and used in identical combinations in alternating lozenges , or arranged according to some well-planned scheme , the rugs become interesting . The hexagon unit 132 RUGS OF JUTE YARN is crocheted precisely as a table mat for hot dishes , and requires no special directions . In turning from crocheted jute rugs to those in the craft of hooking , we find both three-ply and rope jute acceptable . It is unwise to shear the pile , since the material does not felt , and cutting the loops weakens the fabric . It is true that by very careful handling , a cut pile may remain firm for quite a long time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its durability is sapped . This non-felting characteristic is always taken into account in textile manufacturing in which jute is employed , and homecraft workers may well benefit by the expert skill therein exhibited . In hooked rugs each stitch , when sheared , is separate not even being connected by the felting of filaments that touch , as in wool rags . Also jute has an inherent glossy texture that is somewhat slippery , and stitches will ease out of the foundation readily . Sufficient reason for leaving loops unsheared is apparent . The jute rug pictured is in genuine hooking . It was made by the writer when carrying on some experiments with the medium when it first came out . The rug has been in constant and rather hard use ever since and is by no means worn out yet . The motifs were taken from an antique Daghestan . The heaviest rope jute was employed , and the coarseness of the medium necessitated decided enlargement of the pattern , but this does not mar the beauty . The double pointing of the field design immediately classes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of rug is stressed elsewhere , together with the 133 HOMECRAFT RUGS inadvisability of fashioning prayer rugs . The jute hooked rug is shown on Plate XII . It may be mentioned that as jute is a medium lower in rank than rags or yarn , the rugs , however attractive , do not belong in quite the same class . Speed in the making is therefore doubly desirable , and the punch needle immediately suggests itself as admirably filling the requirements as a tool of construction . It should be borne in mind that jute hooked rugs are distinctly for porches , and for houses modestly furnished , for cottages and simple seashore places . They are not intended for the main rooms of a city house . There is a type of India drugget with a deep pile . The designs in them are not different from some knot-tied yarn carpets from the Orient . The India rugs commonly come in large sizes . Periodically they have a pronounced vogue . They may be simulated well in jute , in rope or three-ply yarn , but preferably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle lends itself well . For carpet-size druggets , widths of burlap the desired length for the carpet should be hooked , and then sewed together like a carpet , thus insuring motifs matching precisely . It is important to have the colors Oriental as well as the pattern . The third craft suited to jute rug making is braiding . The rugs are constructed as other braided rugs , except that three strands at least of the jute yarn are used in each strand for plaiting . Colors play an important part , as each jute strand may differ from the others making nine hues 134 RUGS OF JUTE YARN in a single plait . Such a kaleidoscopic combination is not as pleasing , however , as more conservative color treatment . In these rugs , as in all homecraft floor coverings , beauty is dependent upon the artistry of the rug maker . This artistry can be brought into good play in all the various kinds of jute rugs described . 135 IX TAPESTRY FLOOR COVERINGS The highest type of decorative textile floor covering is found in the tapestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure gold and silver were interwoven with delicate strands of silk and wool , and jewels of enormous value were introduced . Nor did the grandeur confine itself to the rugs alone , for they were held in place by orange-shaped gold weights , studded with precious stones placed sometimes at intervals of not over four feet . These ancient rug fasteners of five-pound gold nuggets bear little resemblance to modern ones of no intrinsic value , though the latter have the convenient advantage of being flat . Most of these tapestries that have withstood the ravages of time have had the precious metals " drizzled " out , and the gems have been stolen or confiscated . Nevertheless , so priceless are they to-day that to tread upon them would be desecration . They are again put to their original purpose of wall hangings , as we call them , though they actually were tent hangings . By their once gay colors , now mellowed by age , the drabness and severe plainness of the tent sides became a blaze of glory , and the stitchery pictures beautified the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOMECRAFT RUGS The transformation of tapestry tent hangings to textile floor coverings , is ascribed to a picturesque occurrence . Tradition says that a tapestry was taken from a wall and spread before a king to glorify his pathway , protect his feet , and bespeak homage . When he had passed on his way , the textile was again hung in its accustomed place , to be more highly treasured , even , than before . This respect having once been paid , it could scarcely be disregarded again , and a precedent was established for this monarch , and others with whom subjects wished to court favor . It was no such sumptuous carpet that was spread before Queen Elizabeth to protect her feet from the mud , but an act of equally chivalrous courtesy and homage was paid by Sir Walter Raleigh when he snatched the coat from his back and spread it in the pathway of his Queen , lest her dainty shoes find contact with the muddy water . The contrast in these " carpets " improvised for royalty is not as immense as might at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of " Good Queen Bess " were lavishly embroidered in silks and gold threads , and ornamented with gold lace . It is known that , from time immemorial , rugs were associated with worship and often used as decorations for altars . They continue to be so employed to this day , in many countries , as instanced in the Mecca rugs , and other holy carpets . This raises a doubt about the romantic tale of the origin of carpets following the use of tapestries as floor coverings spread before kings , for it certainly 140 TAPESTRY FLOOR COVERINGS seems equally probable that the first tapestry used as a carpet was laid before an altar and trod upon by priests and those known as holy men . Credence can be given either story , with the surety that one or the other of them is true . Romance is the very warp and weft of tapestry floor coverings . There is a concensus of opinion , based on archeological research and textile investigation , that the first rugs were without pile , " smooth-faced , " as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that tapestry was the textile . This is further substantiated by the fact that the only two types of smooth-faced Oriental rugs are in tapestry weave : namely , Ghileems , and Shemakhas . The former is reputed to be the first and earliest type of Oriental rug . In what era in the dawn of civilization tapestries , as we know them , were first fabricated is not known , but that they came from the Far East is recognized as certain . The Israelites are said to have instructed the Egyptians in tapestry weaving . Pieces of tapestry from Egyptian tombs of great antiquity are to be seen in the museum of Cairo . Centuries later the work found its way to France , per-haps in 726 A.D. It kept its prestige as a religious and royal textile inviolate . Up to the middle of the thirteenth century the tapissiers stated that their work " is for the service only of churches or great men like kings or no-bles " ( Livres des Metiers ) . When the work entered England as a craft in 1509 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier even if the weavers did lift their pronouncement , as HOMECRAFT RUGS princely prices prevailed . It is interesting to note that the Aubusson carpets , so justly famous , are tapestry textiles of smooth-face . Whether made in Europe or America , these carpets are used to-day for wall hangings in preference to floor coverings . Their manufacture with tiny bobbins ( instead of threaded needles ) applied from the back is in accord with time-honored methods . Ancient tapestries ? some of which , as we have seen , were used as rugs ? were woven on a loom of some sort , and the stitches were taken around the warp threads in such a way that they formed an interlacing weft , there being none other . Later on , tiny hand bobbins were employed , each being wound with some colored yarn required in the pattern , the thread being cut and the end left hanging after the stitches were taken . As the ends came on the wrong side of the work , and were proof against unraveling , they were left shaggy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same appearance , as it , too , has short ends hanging . From this brief account of the stitchery it will be seen that it is a sort of embroidery done on the warp . It is not duplicated by cross stitch , with which , in this age , tapestry is often confused , for cross stitch is inherently an embroidery on a previously woven textile , while tapestry is inherently a textile embroidered in the weaving . Genuine tapestry can never be embroidery only ; hence the name " needlepoint tapestry , " " canvas tapestry , " and " tapestry embroidery " are significant , always differentiating the embroidery from the genuine article . This does // not mean that the latter , by whichever name it is called , is not exquisite , as indeed it may be , but that it is always a replica . There are certain similarities , however , between genuine tapestry work and needlepoint tapestry embroidery on canvas , and when these are understood , a reason is recognized for the appellation " tapestry rugs " to canvas worked carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which certain warp and weft threads had been drawn out . Embroidery on such a home-prepared fabric is common in all countries abroad . When the stitches are taken on the warp threads only , either in loom or handdrawn foundations , the work corresponds to genuine tapestry and the name " tapestry stitch " is deserved . Homecraft rugs , therefore , can rightfully claim to be tapestry floor coverings when they are embroidered on warp threads , whether held together by weft , afterward inserted , or previously woven into the textile . The exigencies of canvas stitchery are such , however , that in smooth-faced surfaces , such as tapestry embroidery , the medium naturally crosses the weft also , strengthening , though not actually making it . As the weft can neither be dispensed with nor combed up , it would be visible unless worked over , so this becomes an indispensable element in the embroidery , all the more since the work must be done on canvas with a large mesh and coarse medium , to insure sufficient weight and durability to the rug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOMECRAFT RUGS der genuine tapestry , and is granted its place by custom and courtesy in canvas-work tapestry , supplies sufficient reason for omitting it from this chapter . Of so great importance , however , is the stitch in rugcraft , and so popular , that an entire chapter is devoted to this Phrygian work and its ancient historical background . Needlepoint tapestry rugs in gros-point were not unknown to the Colonial settlers , though seldom made . Gros-point is merely an enlarged form of petit-point , a stitch in canvas tapestry that is a direct outgrowth of genuine tapestry weaving . It becomes enlarged either because the canvas is coarse , or the stitches are taken over more threads . It is always worked primarily on warp threads . It may be noted in passing that the name " tent stitch " comes from the frame used to hold the textile foundation . This frame was called a tenture , or tenter , from the Latin tendo , to stretch . The word " tenter " is applied to-day to a machine for the stretching of loom-woven cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textile experts , the term " on tenter hooks " is well known . Embroidery was originally held in its position in its frame by hooks , instead of between two closely fitted rings , as found in modern tentures , or embroidery frames . With the stiffened canvas now generally used in tapestry and other canvas-work rugcraft , no frames are needed . The textile has sufficient body to hold its own . This is an item in favor of canvas rug making . The sole equipment consists of a blunt needle , large enough to take the 144 TAPESTRY FLOOR COVERINGS yarn . The embroidery is simplicity itself ; and since all the materials are easy to get , there is every reason for the vogue of tapestry rugs in America . In England there is a distinct renaissance of embroidered , Bros-point carpets . Ladies of title and rank are gladly supplying designs from their treasured floor coverings in this identical stitch . Some of these needlework carpets of English embroidery in fine stitchery date back to 1690 . No less a personage than Lady Walpole embroidered such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroidered carpets the work was in the hands of persons of high rank , where it seems to have flourished mildly . The people of Vienna presented Lord Westmoreland , the Ambassador from England , with a needlework carpet of large size as an especial tribute of appreciation . This was about 1855 . Lady Suffield is also known to have made an embroidered rug . It is spoken of as a survival of carpet work once popular . All of these carpets are needlepoint on canvas . The one recently copied is distinctive . It has a design of flowers in an urn , four on each side in panels , while in the center are four panels with diminutive baskets of flowers . The border consists of flowers and leaves coming from a stem that undulates in scroll fashion about the carpet . It is embroidered in strips the width of the canvas , and then the breadths are seamed together . Many early American needlepoint carpets were similarly seamed to give sizes beyond the possibility of a 14511 HOMECRAFT RUGS width of woven foundation . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms , for it is only the latter that can supply seamless rugs . The vogue for canvas needlepoint rugs has become so definite in America within the past few years that extralarge-mesh canvas is now brought out to facilitate quick work . The kind with but four holes to an inch is one such , and on it rugs can be made with the speed graphically described by the phrase " as quick as chain lightning . " The use of the word chain recalls one of the stitches , which has the same name , and by which the Oriental smooth-face Shemakha rugs can be reproduced . The stitch known by the name of the rug is recommended for canvas that is not so coarse and it will be given first attention . It may be mentioned that needlepoint rugcraft of the counted thread , canvas embroidery type , can be done on burlap , as it was in olden times , but the extra trouble involved is now unnecessary , and even futile , for woven mesh canvas is a superior foundation . The Shemakha stitch of canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect that it rightfully comes by the Oriental appellation . The genuine rug stitch directions can be followed to the letter in needlepoint tapestry rug making . Griffen Lewis describes the stitch in " The Practical Book of Oriental Rugs " as follows : " The different colored woof threads are twisted over and under the warp threads by means of a needle in such a way that each stitch is made diagonally , taking in two of the warp threads , and leaving every alternate row of 146 TAPESTRY FLOOR COVERINGS stitches facing the opposite direction , after the herringbone pattern . On the under side , the shaggy ends of the colored woof threads are left loose . " It may be added that the edges are usually overcast and the ends fringed . The designs are chiefly those of the Caucasian group known as Daghestan and Shirvan . A rug maker can follow these directions with a needle threaded with tapestry yarn , different tones being requisitioned as the design requires . The needle is brought up through a hole in the canvas and put down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or left ) according to the direction of the line being worked . This brings the 147 HOMECRAFT RUGS yarn diagonally over two warp strands , as in the genuine weaving . The yarn ends are left loose on the under side in the needlepoint rug as in the Oriental rug , but they should be worked over , for a few stitches when starting a stitch , or run under a few stitches when finishing a needleful . The second Shemakha needlepoint stitch is otherwise known as chain-stitch , as mentioned . It is worked between rows of warp threads , precisely as regulation chain-stitch done over one or two rows of weft . Re-insert the needle in a hole in the canvas and bring it up two holes lower down , holding the yarn under the needle on the surface of the foundation while the yarn is drawn snugly . The work must progress in the same direction , beginning always at the same end of the rug , for in one stitch , the herringbone effect is produced . It will be narrower than in the Shemakha stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain Shemakha stitch must be completed without interruption , for each stitch is linked to the one preceding and the one succeeding it . There can be no skipping about , as is possible in the first type of Shemakha stitch , where isolated stitches may be set to indicate a pattern , or conveniently dispose of a needleful of colored yarn . Each color in chain Shemakha stitch must be introduced as called for in the line being worked and in its prescribed place following the pattern . The medium must be coarse enough to conceal warp threads . The rug illustrated is typical of Shemakha embroidery of the first type . By comparing it with a genuine She-148 TAPESTRY FLOOR COVERINGS makha rug its close duplication in stitchery is immedi ately apparent , even to the number of stitches in the linear inch . ( See Plate XIII . ) The design has the Caucasian feeling and is wrought in tapestry yarn having the Oriental colorings . The galley and water motifs are suggested in the border while the field has the broad geometric pattern style so often found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noticed . In genuine Shemakhas it is customary to have outlines done in black . Again correct developments are found in the Oriental red of the field and in the blue , the orange and the light natural wool color . This rug , embroidered by the writer , has been in use for a number of years as a wall hanging and a table " carpet . " One of like size in exactly the same stitchery has been in use as a floor rug for twelve years . It is still in good condi tion and likely to give much longer service . It took just two weeks to design , embroider , and make the fringe for this twenty by thirty-two inch rug , and to complete it with lining and interlining . Rugs of this type are choice and also rare . They can be used appropriately with the finest Oriental carpets . As they so closely resemble genuine Shemakhas it is interest ing to note what Mary Churchill Ripley says about these Eastern carpets in her " Oriental Rug Book " : " Needle-work upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orient , notably Bagdad stripes , camel's-hair shawls and the Soumac rugs , from the backs of which 149 HOMECRAFT RUGS hang the long ends of colored wools used in the weaving and decoration " ; and also , " Much greater skill is required to make these delicate tissues of intricate pattern than is needed in the tying in of knots in a pile carpet . . . . " Fortunately for homecraft rug makers , replica Shemakhas can be made easily and quickly , as has been indicated . When copying patterns for Shemakha rugs it is wise to take them direct from some genuine rug of this kind , for then the stitch requires no adaptation . Do not attempt to make ends duplicate side borders . The stitch is so at variance in its length and width that this presents difficulties . It will be noticed in genuine Shemakha rugs that ends and sides are not alike . If a cross stitch design or a pattern from a knot-tied Oriental rug is adapted to a Shemakha , consider each point where the stitches in the elongated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be found that the distance from tips at the ends of a herringbone stitch to this point will be equal to a square . This simplifies adapting patterns . There are several canvas stitches that can be used to advantage in fashioning rugs of the tapestry order . As we have seen , some of them take on names of rugs . Another , besides those given , is known as the Smyrna cross stitch or double cross stitch , and is mentioned here in connection with Oriental nomenclature rather than stitchery . It is made by working a straight cross through the holes left vacant after working a regulation cross stitch , 150 TAPESTRY FLOOR COVERINGS three holes square : that is , over two rows of warp and two of weft . This heavily padded stitch covers the canvas quickly , and without requiring the extra amount of yarn that would at first glance seem needed . The greater space occupied by a single stitch substantially offsets such a dis-advantage . Tapestry rugs of distinction are made from the stitch inter-changeably called Gobelin and tapestry stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . It is a vertical stitch , covering two , three or more threads , instead of only one , as in regulation tapestry or Gob-elfin stitch . The length of the stitch suitable for making rugs depends upon the size of the canvas employed . It should be long enough for all rows of stitches to be clearly defined , but not so long that they prevent a firm , substantial texture . Three-quarters of an inch is advised . This stitch is a favorite in raffia embroidery on canvas imported from Italy in the shape of bags , cases and purses . Instead of this raffia medium , rug yarns should be used , or strands cut from one-quarter to one-half inch wide from silk or fine lisle stockings , or closely woven 151 HOMECRAFT RUGS Jersey cloth . This medium may be used in other tapestry rugs when the foundation is sufficiently coarse . The strips may be cut either on the straight or bias . If the latter , use the one-half inch width . Rugs in any of these mediums other than yarn immediately slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs . The embroidery is done in parallel rows of straight stitches of equal length , so spaced across the rug that they form crosswise rows of sharply defined indentations . This is the opposite structure of Japanese straw mattings . Colors can be introduced at will in any length of stitches that does not infringe upon the indented , linear construction ; or they can be worked regardless of it , though the background must never depart from the precision of parallel stitchery which is germane to the Gobelin rug work . Each stitch is taken its full length on the right and wrong side of the rug , the under part thus forming a padding for the upper and supplying durability to the rug surface . The top of the stitch is straight , which is exactly the reverse of Shemakha rug stitch . Each row of stitches begins in the top holes of the preceding row of stitches , thus forming an uninterrupted rug surface , completely concealing the foundation . The extreme simplicity of the long stitch tempts the rug maker to fashion one of these unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made in a short time . Extra beauty is gained by heavier padding of stitches . An easy way to do this is to work over a strand // of wool , flannel , domett-flannel or outing-flannel . Strips may be torn . They should be a trifle narrower than the length of the embroidery stitch . Braid or tape may be used , if preferred , or any soft strands of lightly twisted cotton cord or yarn . It is not the Gobelin stitch just described that alone is done quickly . All needlepoint tapestry rugs can be constructed with speed and ease . There is , moreover , a fascination about the embroidery that has kept it always popular . So choice is the work that it is still sometimes referred to as " court " or " royal " embroidery . It was a work of court ladies , and because of its close association with the nobility at the time when every lady of rank and leisure plied her embroidery-needle skilfully , in gay or troublous days , there is an atmosphere of romance about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug among her floor coverings has one in a craft of ancient prestige , of regal ancestry , and of beauty that be- , longs to every age . X153 X " TURKY WORKE CARPETTS " After the lapse of two centuries , " Turky Worke " is enjoying a renaissance , the previous revival having been in the 18th century . It is reputed to be the first needle embroidery devised to duplicate the pile of Oriental carpets . " Turky Carpetts " was the original name by which these rugs were known in England . Travelers and traders who went to the Orient brought back tales of the gorgeous textiles , together with occasional rugs , though at just what date this practise began , it is impossible to ascertain , as authorities differ . It would appear that pile carpets did not enter Western Europe until the fourteenth century and it was not until the eighteenth that they took any conspicuous place as floor coverings . There is a pretty story , accorded to be fact , to the effect that Oriental carpets were introduced into England when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride . Her brother fitted up the special suite for his youthful sister in the palace , and the magnificence of it has sounded through the centuries . Together with other appurtenances , he had Oriental rugs imported to impress the English with the glories of the Spanish court and supply the sort of lavish setting which he deemed worthy of his royal sister . 154 " TURKY WORKE CARPETTS " Early in her career Queen Catherine turned her attention to embroidery , for which her native country was then so justly famous , and eventually she became one of the most notable of the group of queens who excelled in needlework . Once , when on trial as the first queen of Henry VIII , she was so hastily summoned before Parliament sitting in judgment , that there were , about her neck , colorful strands of the embroidery silk which she had but lately been employing . Queen Catherine 's embroideries proved the solace of those unhappy days , as they had been the delight of her happy ones . Since " Turky Worke " had then begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Queen Catherine may have employed the stitch . It will serve to fix the date of the invention of this form of embroidery in the minds of Americans in particular to recall the fact that Queen Isabella , under whose patronage Columbus discovered America , was the mother of this English Queen . As early as 1549 inventories recorded " borde carpets &; foote carpets of Turkeye Work , old and woryne . " It is not surprising that the exquisite Oriental carpets fired the imagination of art connoisseurs and craftsmen , and that they immediately sought to discover the stitchery and reproduce its effect . So closely upon the appearance of these carpets , did English " Turky Carpetts " spring into existence , that in 1570 is found the carpet of Lord Verulam , known throughout the world in the realm of needlecraft . Its typical Elizabethan pattern proclaims it to be X1551 HOMECRAFT RUGS the work of English craftsmen , skilled in a manner to bespeak long practise . The conclusion is not to be drawn that " Turky Carpetts " were needle stitchery on a finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hempen cord . This reference to a warp indicates that the knots were tied directly upon it , and that a weft was woven every few rows as in Oriental rugcraft . This method of making the earliest type of Turkey Work can not have differed in any appreciable way from the work in the Far East , for the knot in both is that known as Ghiordes . It was the process of making the knots and the duplication of the stitchery in " Turky Carpetts " that was responsible for the name Turkey Work in English . In England , Ireland and France , carpets continue to be made to this day in practically the same workmanship , though they are not called by the same name , but are known as handtufted carpets . The Ghiordes knot is used as in " Turky Carpetts . " The prices that these carpets command put them beyond the reach of any but the wealthy . Nowhere have I found the cost less than forty dollars a yard , and from this the prices soar to two hundred and sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs . Yet it lies within the power of homecraft rug makers to produce like effects in Turkey Work done on canvas with no more expenditure of time than required for other compact stitchery . " Turky Worke " was originally embroidered on a coarse and very strong hempen textile , resembling burlap , 156 , , TURKY WORKE CARPETTS which latter fabric , however , is of jute , and not of like durability . The old textile was not meshed , and the work had to be done on carefully counted threads . A high grade of burlap can be used now , but a rug maker would scarcely choose it when meshed linen canvas is available . This is the recognized textile appropriate to Turkey Work in the present renaissance . On it the embroidery can progress much more rapidly , as the threads are already counted , and divided by spaces for stitches . Today the term Turkey Work is definitely associated with embroidery done on the warp of canvas , preferably that woven with two threads in each cross-bar . Although done on a previously woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of making , the knot is the same . It is well to remember that the term " Turkey Work " has a double technical significance . In antique " Turky Worke , " the pile is short , oftentimes being no longer than that on many genuine Turkish rugs . By examining these textiles , the comparative shortness even of those known as having a deep pile , is immediately recognized . Attention is especially directed to this feature , as there is an erroneous tendency in modern Turkey Work to have the pile much too long . Apart from the fact that these long strands are not true to type , there is a definite disadvantage in having them so , as the pattern is not brought out with the same clearness in a long-pile fabric as in a short . Fortunately the short pile is just as easy to fashion . Incidentally it may be mentioned that a modern piece of Turkey Work , 157 II HOMECRAFT RUGS with its shaggy pile , can be distinguished at a glance from an antique . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire the rare beauty of antique " carpets " when colors are wisely chosen , the stitch correct , the pile not too long , and the pattern consistent with antique examples . There are many sources from which designs may be drawn ? from Turkish rugs direct , from Elizabethan patterns , and other old English patterns . One " Turky Worke " chair in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is in bold floral design in softened tones of red , some of which shade to pink , and are intermingled with blue , lemon yellow , green , both in yellowish and bluish shades , and black , the latter almost gone . That it should be , is not strange , for black is an unstable color even in old Oriental rugs , the dyes supposedly being the cause for its giving out before the other colors . This English chair referred to is of the period of James II . It is described thus fully , as it indicates one type of appropriate pattern , together with colors suitable to modern Turkey Work . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which date back to Henry VIII . These include " cowcumbers , cabbages , trafles , trifoils , and pyramids , " the last a design much in evidence in the period of James I. The stitch of Turkey Work consists merely of two short backstitches , so worked that together they form a Ghiordes knot taken through canvas or some other suitable textile . The simplicity of the stitch makes it easy 158 CC TURKY WORKE CARPETTS II to understand how little children of the Orient can make rugs , tying the knots as readily as do adults . With equal ease can the homecraft rug maker fashion rugs that reproduce a like fineness of texture and pile . If she so chooses , identical patterns can be worked . Each knot stitch is as separate in the canvas Turkey Work as in a genuine Turkish carpet made in the Far East . Penelope canvas in size double ought ( oo ) is excellent for the foundation for modern rugs . Each completed knot stitch covers two threads and occupies one bar of the twothreaded weave . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single ought ( o ) and have each completed stitch occupy a width of two bars and be taken with double strands of yarn . This does not make the pile any coarser , because the yarn is equally fine . While the stitchery progresses faster , it requires some added care to keep both strands even . Extra-size yarn , known as rug yarn , may be used , but does not give as beautifully fine a pile . There should be as many large , blunt , crewel needles for the work as there are colors of yarn in the pattern . Before starting to embroider , thread as many needlefuls of different colors as will be needed in the rows to be made . Do not attempt to use only one needle , and thread and re-thread it with each change of colored yarn . Start the stitchery in the lower left-hand corner of the rug pattern , and work in consecutive rows , always from left to right , until the final stitch is set in the upper righthand corner . The rug will have a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work , take the two 159 HOMECRAFT RUGS backstitches over warp threads between the same rows of weft , or along the same line of holes in the canvas . The first stitch is taken about a left-hand warp thread or bar of canvas , and the second about a similar thread or bar on the right . The stitch begins and ends in the identical hole . The transverse stitch comes across and above the two ends , which ends form the pile . To insure this horizontal ( transverse ) stitch always lying across the top , the yarn must always be below the needle when the lefthand stitch is taken , and above the needle when the right-hand stitch is taken . This order can not be neglected , for thus only is the knot formed . By examining the diagram showing the Ghiordes knot and the Turkey Work knot stitch , their duplication is apparent . An end of yarn must be left below the stitch when begun , and again when finished . These two ends form the pile , and they should be as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WORKE CARPETTS In Turkey Work it is not necessary to cut the yarn after each stitch is completed unless the pattern calls for a change in color . Consecutive stitches can be taken by allowing the yarn to remain in a loop between one stitch and the next , the length of the loop being equal to the depth of the pile . When the loops are cut through the center , half of each loop strand will form a strand of pile in the knot stitch next it , and each knot will be a separate entity . The depth of the rug pile may be anywhere from three-eighths to one-half inch , according to the size of the yarn and coarseness of the canvas . It can be accurately gaged by having the ends of stitches or the loops between them always extend as low as some special row of weft threads in the canvas . Or a gage , technically known as a " mesh , " may be employed and each loop be taken over it . If the mesh is used , it is held flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along which the stitches are being taken . Originally the English " mesh " had a knife-blade fitted into one end . After the stitches taken over it in a row were completed , the blade was brought into use at the bottom of the loop , and the yarn automatically cut as the " mesh " was withdrawn . For present-day rugcraft , the " mesh " has been revived , although its name is varied , sometimes being called a " stitch gage , " again a " rugstick , " etc . A narrow ruler , or a steel such as corsetieres use , can be substituted for a regulation mesh , if one is not available . 161 HOMECRAFT RUGS The pile is cut by running a sharp knife through the loops , several at a time , and drawing it out so that it severs the loop ends . Shears can be used in the same way , by running one blade through the loops and cutting many at once . When the loops have been evenly and accurately gaged and cut , the pile requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off any ends that are higher than the rest . There is practically no waste of yarn . The selvages of early English " Turky Carpetts " were in plain weave , turned back and sewed on the under side of the rug . If the canvas foundation of Turkey Work rugs of to-day is turned back , it must be covered with a flat tape , felled down along each edge . The weave of canvas is too loose to be left uncovered . Another way to finish edges is to turn back the canvas for three rows of holes , making the turning along the pattern edge . Baste in position , and take the knot stitches of the embroidery through both thicknesses . To do this , the canvas must be turned back evenly so that the holes are over one another . The ends of rugs should be finished in one of these ways . They may also have fringe , using the yarn of the stitchery , in some one of the neutral colors , for the purpose . Another excellent finish is given the rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it is turned back . These fine braids are found on some Turkish rugs . When fringe is to be made , one extra row of holes should be allowed for it at each end be-16a GC TURKY WORKE CARPETTS low the line of the pattern before the canvas is turned back . There are several pile stitches that can be employed in rugcraft on canvas , but none that has the historic background of the stitch of Turkey Work . Single knot stitch , also called Smyrna stitch is exactly like " Turky Worke " stitch . It is so termed for the reason that Oriental rugs came to be known as " Smyrna rugs " in England , after the former name " Turky Carpetts " fell into disuse . Single Maltese stitch is also identical with that of " Turky Worke " but it is made with many strands of rather fine thread as a medium , and so assumes the character of wee tassels rather than knotted stitchery . Double Maltese stitch , and double Smyrna stitch are actually two knot stitches , taken one above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn under the yarn end ( left at the beginning of the stitch ) and in repeating the stitch , let the yarn form the transverse or retaining stitch across the top of all the stitches . When the loop is cut , there are four strands of pile instead of two . The space left between rows of stitches is twice that between single knot stitches . Therefore the work progresses as rapidly with the double as with the single knot stitches after the knack is acquired . There are other stitches , known as tassel stitch , plush stitch , fringe stitch etc. , any of which can be used if the rug maker so chooses . The pile can be cut when the stitch is knotted or is sufficiently firm . Otherwise it should form a loop pile . All the rugs described are of ancient origin , but there 163 is a new one that comes from Australia with a knotted pile made through canvas . It is constructed with a latch needle similar to the latch-hook needle used in the manu facture of knitted goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook , this is the tool of construction here considered . Those familiar with stitchery will immedi ately recognize this stitch as archaic chain-stitch worked by the primitive people with a hooked needle through a fabric . In the modern work , canvas with its conven iently spaced meshes takes the place of the plain textile . The wool yarn medium is cut into very short lengths . As each stitch is taken separately , a pile surface results and the whole is reminiscent of hooked rugcraft . But there is a difference of approach , since the stitch harks back to chain-stitch , worked with the medium above the foundation , while hooked work comes through tambour work in which the medium is held beneath the founda tion . Each stitch must be taken in the same direction , which may be horizontal or diagonal . The Australian stitch is the former , and is taken about the warp , the medium passing through the holes in a horizontal row for each succeeding line of stitchery . While this same order may be followed , the diagonal stitch has proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one used in the rug section il lustrated . In this , each stitch is taken diagonally across the square formed where warp and weft are interwoven . The pile surface is exquisite , but no less so than the under side , which displays even rows of what appear to be tent 164 t4 TURKY WORKE CARPETTS stitches , often called half cross stitches . ( See sampler C , Plate III , and sampler B , Plate V. ) To make one of these rugs , lay the foundation on a table so that the canvas is smooth and flat . Turn over the upper and lower edges to the depth of three rows of holes , which must come precisely over the ones beneath them . Baste with large stitches . If the sides are selvages , they can be left without turning over onto the front of the canvas , but if not they also should be so turned and basted . The outer rows of stitches are taken through the doubled canvas , supplying extra durability and a fine finish to the rug edges . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer rows , increasing their strength still further . Place little piles of yarn , cut into two-inch lengths , on top of the canvas , having the colors such as will be needed for the rows of stitchery to be taken . The pattern should be in full view of the rug maker . Start the stitchery in the lower left-hand corner of the canvas . Double one or two strands , according to the row being worked , and insert the crochet hook under the loop . Put the hook through the second hole in the first row of holes and bring it up through the first hole in the second row , that is the one nearest the left-hand edge of the canvas . Catch the yarn , which is held by the finger and thumb of the left hand , and draw the ends through both holes and through the looped yarn . By this operation the ends of yarn are tied in a knot and also simultaneously released . The upstanding ends of yarn form a pile stitch . 165 Continue to make row after row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is covered with them in the colors determined by the pattern . If the rug is to be kept true to Oriental type , the design must of course be Oriental . Motifs from genuine Orien tal rugs can be copied readily by counted stitches , if the rug is turned wrong side up , and the design is taken off on draughting ( cross-stitch ) paper . Keep the pattern simple , using few motifs . Gain variety by transposing colors in different motifs . Avoid numerous colors . Study Oriental rug tones and note the few that are used and the wide variety in effect that these Eastern people get in the way described . The beauty of the under side of the rug makes one hesitate to hide it under a lining , but linings have the advantage of saving the rub of stitches against hard floors . The tread is softened and the wear is lessened . Denim makes an excellent lining , if one is used . As " Turky Carpetts , " when genuine , are never lined , and those of Turkey Work are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maker has her preference as guide . After the rugs are sheared , in whatever stitchery they are fashioned , remove the fuzz with a rotary motion of the palms , pressing them gently but firmly against the pile . This pressure promotes felting and adds a fine surface finish . It will be remembered that part of the process of " treating " an Oriental carpet to impart a silky sheen is to run it between heavy rollers that are heated . While the hand pressure combined with the 166 " TURKY WORKE CARPETTS " warmth of the palms under the slight friction , can not be expected to supply any comparable finish , it does bring out the beauty of the design and add a certain fineness to the finish and clearness to the colors . This is partly because it brushes away straggling tips of yarn and partly because it eliminates the fuzz . It is to be expected that all of these exquisitely fine sheared yarn rugs will " shed " somewhat , for a time after they are made . Genuine Oriental carpets do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised by using yarn raveled from knit and crocheted articles . The yarn should be straightened before using , if it is crinkly . Otherwise an even pile is impossible to attain , and no rugs except those made to imitate some types of fur rugs should have anything but straight pile . Such fur effects can be gained in ravel knit pile , in which strips are one and one-half or one and three-quarters inches wide and are in natural wool tones . All Oriental pile should be straight . To take the kinks out of previously used yarn , wet it and wind into a ball while damp . An even better method is to wind the yarn loosely over a thin board , such as a shingle , for the strands will be kept taut and straight as they dry . In all the various pile rugs described , however excellent each may be , there is none that has the prestige in rugcraft that belongs to " Turky Carpetts , " for in them the Ghiordes knot is actually fashioned through canvas . Notwithstanding all the centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone remains the perfect re 167 HOMECRAFT RUGS production of Oriental pile knot in embroidery . It has come into its own again with the revival of interest in all types of handmade rugs . With it choice replicas of knottied rugs can be made at home . Their cost need be no barrier , as has been demonstrated . Rugs of Turkey Work are for the finest rooms of a house , however spacious it may be , or however handsomely furnished , for by right of beauty of craftsmanship they belong with genuine Oriental carpets . 168 XI RUGS OF CROSS STITCH OR PHRYGIAN WORK To connect so " modern " a thing as cross stitch with the twilight history of a pre-historic people is indeed strange . But to have reason for belief that the identical stitch appeared in carpets of the ancient Phrygians and Cappadocians , probably as early as the seventh century B.C. , over 2500 years ago , is even more staggering . This is especially noteworthy in view of the fact that cross stitch floor coverings , when made to-day , are considered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archeological lore of carpets and rugs , the finding is grounded in fact . It appears that there are monuments and tombs of the Midas tomb variety ? and chief among these , one with the mythical name of " Midas " inscribed on it ? that present designs obviously copied from patterns employed on cloth and carpets . It is difficult to consider going back farther than the Phrygians , if we credit the legend that they were the first people to inhabit the earth , and the originators of language . Little as we can believe the tales , it is curiously true that excavations frequently corroborate incidental traditional details , and present-day events establish links of union with past ages . In the matter of the carpets , the sculptured patterns referred to , and the her-169 HOMECRAFT RUGS aldic designs , are so unrelated to those employed by other of these remote peoples as to establish their identity as of Phrygian type . Moreover , to-day in certain regions that correspond geographically to this archaic section , there appear occasionally in peasant homes carpets having the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verify archeological investigation . The rug illustrated is a faithful copy of the frontal decoration of the Midas tomb , which is supposed not only to be a design taken from a carpet , but to represent in 170 HOMECRAFT RUGS low relief and as well as the material permitted , the fabric itself . It was customary , when persons were notable , to hang carpets before entrance-ways and on walls , and Midas was honored by having one simulated on this , his monument or tomb . It is considered not unlikely that the surface once was in colors , probably red , blue , white and black , thus presenting an even more realistic representation of a textile . To-day no color is found on the Midas tomb ; but on one known as the Delikli Tach there are signs of polychrome treatment after the lapse of thirty centuries . If , when working the rug pattern given , the design be carried out in black against a background of earth-red , the combination would approximate one of the early era . Or , again , old blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true to type . These , or other old tapestry hues , should be employed , unless warm greys or neutral rock tones preserve in the textile the hewn-stone semblance . But always the color contrasts should be pronounced to bring out the marvelous beauty and subtle intricacies of the pattern . Every stitch in this choice rug has been so carefully worked out that the design is as easy to follow as any other cross stitch pattern . To the scale of ten stitches to the linear inch in which it is developed , the finished rug measures eighteen by twenty-seven inches . On canvas six , seven or eight stitches to the inch , the size is proportionately increased ; while on the four stitches to the inch // canvas , the rug becomes large without any increase of labor . The meander , the star formation of squares , and the cross , are motifs immediately apparent . The lozenges are supposed to represent joists , though , " Lozenges , squares , crosses , meanders , and all forms that ornament these sculptured fronts , are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minor produce at the present day . . . on those justly prized carpets made in the provinces which answer to the Lydia and Phrygia of olden times . " ' To revert again to the cross stitch , though it would not have been used on carpets at its earliest invention , it is accepted as one of the stitches used in the embroidery of the hangings or " curtains " of the Tabernacle de-scribed in Exodus ( chapter 28 ) I491 B.C. The Jewish stitchery came later than the Phrygian . That it is a stitch eminently suited to floor coverings is evidenced also by the Spanish seventeenth and eighteenth century and the Colonial eighteenth and nineteenth century cross stitch rugs and carpets . The name of the primeval city of Phrygia is still con nected with cross and half-cross ( tent ) stitch , for in the language of classic stitchery it is known as " Phrygian work . " Since the Phrygians and Babylonians were the founders of embroidery , it is close to impossible to trace anything earlier . The stitch , from the earliest era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by varying names ? Pointe de Marque , plaited Slav stitch , HOMECRAFT RUGS canvas work , Montenegrin cross stitch , etc . To know such terms aids in the adapting of designs to rugcraft ; for , by whatever name called , whenever the stitch is a square cross stitch , the design in which it appears can be copied in rug making . It should , of course , be appropriate , and the materials suitable , such as heavy yarns on cross stitch or tapestry canvas . It is possible , though less easy , to adapt elongated cross stitch , such as the Persian . Its shape requires special calculation on the part of the rug maker . The size of a rug or carpet , in either case , depends on the size of the pattern employed , as well as the size of the canvas weave and number of " repeats " in the pattern . It is by means of repeating a design that a rug can readily be made to suit the floor space for which it is intended . Apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be emphasized that the work is eminently suited to the embroidering of rugs to-day . The stitch is of double thickness , as the name implies . The under stitch acts as a padding for the upper on which the footfalls come , thus relieving the wear and tear , to a marked degree . It was because of the extra durability of the work that cross stitch was used on kneeling-cushions for churches , thereby being confused with the regulation " cushion stitch " which is similar to cross stitch . When taking designs from Oriental rugs there need be little variation . In the Eastern handweaving there are slight discrepancies , as the depth of a stitch is a trifle less than its width ; but this in no wise interferes with the 174II HOMECRAFT RUGS copying of the work , stitch by stitch , in the square mesh of the cross stitch . One of the notable advantages in cross stitch rugcraft is its diversity . Rugs with the flavor of genuine carpets of the Orient are not the only ones that lend themselves to the technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the flat surface may be varied by introducing some one of the several raised or pile embroidery stitches , with or without sheared loops . To get such an embossed effect in some of the old cross stitch rugs of this country , rug makers , puzzled about this technique , resorted to pulling strands of yarn through the interstices of the canvas , previously embroidered , allowing the ends to project slightly . Among these early American floor coverings , treasured in museums and private collections , are to be found cross stitch carpets , hall and stair runners and rugs . One carpet ( Plate XXI ) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , New York , was made about ' Soo by the wife and daughters of Judge Pliny Moore , for their family mansion in Champlain , New York . The stair carpet to match is in the possession of Mrs. Robert Soutter , of Boston , a great-granddaughter . The set of floor coverings for drawing-room , hall , and stairs remained in use for generations , for Mrs. Soutter can remember running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little girl visiting her grandmother . The history of the making of these carpets is interesting . It took four years to complete the embroidery on the 176 RUGS OF CROSS STITCH OR PHRYGIAN WORK set . The widths of linen foundation are completely covered with cross stitchery . Owing to the inherent precision of cross stitch and the careful planning of the design with its Greek fret border , the pattern comes together without discrepancies when the widths are sewed together like breadths of carpet , loom-woven . All the materials were homemade . The wool used in the embroidery was from sheep raised on the estate . It was home-dyed in tones varying from a rich cream to a mellow , dark , woodbrown , the dyes being brewed from the roots and barks of trees on the place . The linen foundation was from flax grown and harvested in the fields and spun and woven into cloth by the family . This work was always done in colonial days by the gentlefolk of this country , just as much as the embroidery . In England and Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , under whose expert skill the stitchery held its place in the realms of art . It was " fancywork , " as distinguished from plain sewing . In America , also , embroidery has always been done by women in their leisure moments . " Though on pleasure she was bent , she had a frugal mind " may well be said of every artistic woman who in the pioneer days of this country turned her skill in needlecraft to the making of floor coverings . To-day there is no more practical nor beautiful form of this applied stitchery than cross stitch carpets , runners and rugs . The fact that the cross stitch carpets in question , after having served as floor coverings for years , are still in ex-177II HOMECRAFT RUGS cellent condition and quite ready for further use , should it be required of them , bears witness to the durability of cross stitch carpets , made on stout foundations with a stitch that is not too coarse . Even the fact that " parlors " were rooms of state , seldom lived in , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls and front stairs , does not discredit this evidence . A floor covering that can withstand the tread of hard leather soles and stiff heels has an enduring quality . Oriental carpets never have to stand such usage in their native lands . It is only with unshod or slippered feet that the Orientals walk on their exquisite handmade rugs . It takes the Occidental to treat floor coverings in this harsh manner . Fortunately cross stitch carpets have the needed durability to a marked degree . In reference to the foundation fabrics best suited to cross stitch rug making , there still is nothing equal to a hand-woven linen . However , this is now difficult to get , as well as expensive to buy . One of the best modern fabrics is Aida canvas , known sometimes and in some localities abroad as Java canvas . It is a particularly strong-weave , stiffened canvas made of several strands of warp and weft between the holes . Ordinary canvas , variously known as tapestry and cross stitch canvas , does not have as many strands of warp and weft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this looseness of weave , though it is often used . In this , there comes an extra-coarse weave , brought out especially for modern rug making . It has but four holes to the inch . On it the heaviest rug yarns are needed , or 178 RUGS OF CROSS STITCH OR PHRYGIAN WORK their equivalent in those not quite so coarse . Cross stitch wrought on counted threads was done in some of the Colonial rugs on burlap instead of linen . It is true of this jute material that when used as the filling in certain Oriental rugs , durability is sacrificed to low cost . The ancients who made cross stitch carpets used linen foundations , and the Colonial rug makers used it also for this stitchery . The embroidered carpets are choice and deserve foundations that will be as enduring as the stitchery . It is for this reason that Aida canvas is advised . Jersey cloth , and other knit-woven fabrics , can be cut in three-eighths inch bias strips , and be used in place of yarn on the wide-spaced canvas . Also it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in such widths as can be drawn easily through the spaces and conceal the foundation when the stitchery is complete . Whatever the working medium , when used on ordinary canvas , it must hide the goods ; but in the more decorative varieties such as Aida canvas , the field of the rug may be exposed , and a border with a medallion center complete the embroidery . The field may have cornerpieces as well as the medallion , as is customary in Oriental rugs . Or the field may have smaller motifs scattered over the surface . As will be seen , the amount of stitchery may vary and therefore it is possible to make a cross stitch rug in an amazingly short time , and in as thrifty a way as any " thrift " rug . A blunt crewel needle with an eye sufficiently large to take the medium should be used . Or a bodkin may be substituted if strips of fabric are used . 179 II HOMECRAFT RUGS Since cross stitch is one of the earliest embroidery stitches and has remained popular throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are certain little quirks that must be given attention if perfection is attained . To know them , the rug maker has to be thoroughly acquainted with the method of making cross stitches . For one thing the stitches when embroidered consecutively should be made in pairs , or else in two journeys . Each stitch occupies a square surface of a foundation fabric and is comprised of two slanting stitches crossing exactly in the center . To make , bring up the threaded needle through the lower left hand hole , down at upper right , up at lower right , down at upper left , completing one " stitch " ; the next one is taken in reverse order ? up at upper left , down at lower right , up at upper right , and down in lower left , thus completing the second stitch ; leaving the needle ready to start work again as in the first stitch . The back of the work shows a meander ; the right side , the cross stitches . Not only is this the easiest way to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not a bit of yarn or other medium is wasted . Isolated cross stitches are made in a similar way . Grounding ? that is , stitches taken on a background ? is best made by working all stitches in one direction at one time or in one journey across the goods , and those crossing them in a second journey . This is the quickest way to work long rows of one color . Throughout all the work , whether in grounding or design , all under stitches must go in the same direction and all upper cross stitches 18o RUGS OF CROSS STITCH OR PHRYGIAN WORK also in parallel rows . Exquisite patterns have been marred to the eye of the expert by stitches embroidered regardless of this precision of direction . The worker evidently assumed that , as the stitchery is geometrically square , its direction of lines was of no consequence . But , like the nap of cloth , they must run the same way , or blemishes are readily apparent . In rugcraft , the work is heavy and coarse rather than fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the right way is the easy and the economical one , and the stitch itself one of the easiest ever devised . A cross stitch rug requires a lining , and if an interlining also is added the rug will last longer and be more luxuriously soft . Canton flannel , or double-faced domett-cloth , is excellent for the interlining , and denim for the lining . Burlap does not last as long as the rug . This I have found by experience . When the embroidery on the rug has been completed , lay a damp cloth over the wrong side of the embroidered surface and press , having a soft cloth over the ironingboard , under the stitchery . When absolutely dry , put the interlining in so that it comes to the edges without being turned in , and baste securely . It is well to tack it with stitches invisible on the right side of the rug . Turn the unworked edges of the rug back over the interlining and then put on the lining and baste it along the edges , leaving sufficient space to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hem along the edge . If fringe finishes the two ends , make it directly in the 181 HOMECRAFT RUGS rug foundation through the holes close to where the embroidery stops . Use six or seven strands of ordinary threeply yarn or its equivalent . Turn in the hem close to the fringe , which will then extend beyond the rug . The fringe should be made after the embroidery is completed and before the rug is pressed or lined . In turning from the details of technique in cross stitch floor coverings to individual types of rugs , we find three deserving special attention , besides the Midas rug previously described . They are the silhouette and figurine rug , the Assisi rug , and the map rug . Silhouette and Figurine Rugs The modern silhouette rug takes it name from the type of design , which may be portrait or figurine delineation . No aid to portrayal can be supplied other than that of the edges of one color against the background of different hue . So decidedly must colors accent each other that a definite impression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motifs , is conveyed . Black against white or cream is the regulation silhouette combination , and it is apt to appear in silhouette rugs . But color schemes to match or harmonize with the color scheme of a room are excellent , provided they permit the necessary sharp contrast to bring out the pictorial quality . In figurine rugs more latitude is permissible if the rug maker chooses to introduce color harmonies . The shades 182 HOMECRAFT RUGS must be flat colors , with no attempt to indicate shading . A costume may be in one color with bands of a contrasting hue . Posies may grow on green stalks . Color must be in masses , as is consistent with the character of silhouettes . The background stitchery must throw the silhouettes into relief . Silhouette and figurine rugs are sometimes wrought in other types of stitchery than cross stitch . It is quite possible to make attractive hooked , knit , crocheted , etc. , silhouette rugs , provided the work progresses by counted threads or stitches . It is only thus that the required precision of delineation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame to set it off to best advantage , so do these fabric silhouette rugs require some sort of frame to carry them to satisfying completion . This frame does not have to be anything more substantial than the rug border , which serves the purpose admirably . And because these rugs have such compelling pictorial quality they appear as fitting for wall decoration as floor covering . This is reversing the order of the earliest rugs , which were wall decorations prior to being placed on the floor . The Assisi Rug The Assisi rug is a distinctly modern floor covering employing two stitches which combine ? in a " positive " or worked background , and a " negative " or unworked design ? to make Assizi work . It is so named from the 184 HOMECRAFT RUGS Italian city where it is chiefly embroidered . The patterns , done on counted threads , are invariably angular . The stitchery is extremely simple , comprising cross stitch and stroke stitch , both of which work up with amazing rapidity . Assisi work is classic in style and workmanship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounding , leaving the design in fabric silhouette . To further bring out the pattern , outlines , and lines accenting it , are worked in the two-sided stroke stitch , or Holbein stitch , which is alike on both sides . The reverse side of the cross stitch shows rows of parallel lines of short stitches exactly joining . This result is easy to accomplish if all the stitches of the first journey of one row are done in half-cross stitch ( tent stitch ) and then all the stitches forming the oblique crosses are done in a second journey in which the needle always is put into the identical stitch-holes of the first journey . This brings the threads crossing on top , and above one another on the wrong side . When several rows of the Assisi work are completed , the reverse side shows straight parallel lines . The medium is never so coarse that the foundation is hidden completely even in worked portions . This is a distinct feature of Assisi work . The two-sided stroke stitch ? Holbein stitch ? is also done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , each stitch being separated by its own length from those next it . In the second journey , by reversing 186 RUGS OF CROSS STITCH OR PHRYGIAN WORK the order of stitches , all spaces are filled and the line is consecutive . The needle must be put into the identical holes made by it in the first line of work . Holbein stitch is named from the artist in whose pictures the embroidery is often delineated . It was a popular stitch in his time , being an outline stitch taken with the weave either horizontally or vertically , with angular turnings , embroidered as described . Often , at the termination of a line a slanted or a Y-shaped stitch is found . It lends additional decoration and is made in the same way as a straight one but diagonally across the weave . All the stitchery in Assisi work is apt to be in one color , though the stroke stitch forming outlines and accents may be in black or some dark contrasting tone . Old blue , Italian red , black , and sage-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation should be a straight weave foundation in which warp and weft cross at right angles with the precision of cross-stitch canvas . Aida canvas is excellent in a neutral shade of ecru . In Italy , linen would be used . Therefore an extra-heavy , round-thread linen in natural color would be in perfect accord . Monks-cloth and even a high grade of burlap are both acceptable . The Aida canvas has the advantage of the stiffness of a cross stitch foundation , and also its holes . Whatever the fabric , it should be good-looking , for it is exposed through the stitchery and the entire field is generally minus embroidery , the pattern consisting then of a deep border only . 187 HOMECRAFT RUGS When the stitchery is completed , line and interline the rug . Fell the lining down close to the turned-in edges of the rug , or bind the edges with a carpet binding in the same colors , or a wide , plain-toned linen tape . No fringe is needed ; but if used , it should be short and of the same medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of the embroidery medium is a consistent and attractive finish for rug ends . Assisi rugs are recommended for their artistry as much as their simplicity of stitchery , and the rapidity with which they are made , all of which characteristics are appealing to the modern rug maker . The Map Rug Though there are map samplers , the map rug is unique . However , maps have been used for decorative purposes for centuries , and there is a distinct element of consistency in using them as floor coverings when treated simply . The most exquisite example of a map as a motif in textiles is instanced in the Kashmir shawl made for the Prince of Wales collection in India when , as Albert Edward , Prince of Wales , the late King Edward VII visited this remote portion of the British Empire in 1875-76 . The map pictures Srinagar , the capital of Kashmir , on the banks of a river . Ships are on the blue water , flowers make gardens gay , trees spread their branches , houses are clearly seen , and persons walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute detail as exquisitely as if the scenic 188 RUGS OF CROSS STITCH OR PHRYGIAN WORK map were an ancient colored print . The parallel of this shawl to a rug is a genuine one , since the word shawl comes from the Sanskrit sala , signifying a floor , a room , and was so named because shawls were first used in the interchangeable capacity of carpets , hangings and coverlets . There is something eminently appropriate about using a fabric map for a floor covering . Its position under foot is in keeping , and on it , as on the magic carpet of Persia , one can be transported in an instant over great spaces with but a single step . It is important to work out cross stitch map rugs in the same quaint way that old map samplers were developed . Unlike the silhouette rug , outlines should be soft against backgrounds , and colors throughout should be subdued . However modern in geographical accuracy the rug may be , it should be " antiqued " in color . 189 XII HOOKED RUGS PART I ORIGIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuality , conceded to be of American origin . They appeal to the rug maker because of their decorative value and their durability . They lure collectors by their quaintness , the historic period they represent in American floor coverings , the ingenuity of patterns developed in so commonplace a medium as rags , the charm of color to be found in choice antiques , mellowed by time , and the intriguing stitchery , the origin of which has baffled the research worker and has been variously attributed to many picturesque sources , more interesting than accurate , since nothing could be more consistent than its development from tambour stitch , later to be traced . The grounds for believing hooked rugs of American invention , either from the section of the United States designated as New England , or from the more northern portion of North America known as Nova Scotia , are based upon investigation , which so far has revealed no records of the work that indicate antecedence in other parts of the globe . X1901 HOOKED RUGS It is true that in England , what is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was employed in rugcraft , certainly at the same time , and probably before hooked rugs were made in America ; but this work , while similar in effect , as is the punch-loop rug work of to-day , is not identical in craftsmanship . Though hooked rugs are of comparatively recent invention , the stitchery has its origin in the ancient East Indian tambour work , sometimes called Indian chain stitch . In this , as in hooked work , the foundation has to be held in a frame and the tool is a hook . The stitch as done in the Orient is one of minute fineness , taken in precisely the same way as in what we are pleased to call " hooked work , " the sole exception being that in most cases the loops in rug work are not drawn through one another but left upstanding . There are instances , however , in which the rugs have a link fashioned pile . After each stitch , the medium is clipped , as in the Oriental knot pile carpet , thus releasing the looped ends which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped stitchery succeeded that of the loop stitch . In most parts of the globe , tambour work has become an obsolete embroidery , though the stitch itself remains in modern chain stitch . It was in the zenith of its favor in America , however , being included in school curriculums , and specifically named under " extras , " when hooked rugs were purported to have been originated , and the naturalness of its adaptation to its new purpose will be made apparent . By the slight variation mentioned , 191 II HOMECRAFT RUGS the work took on a new terminology , sometimes being designated as " drawn in , " " pulled , " " pulled in , " or " pegged , " as well as " hooked " rug work , the last name surviving . Of recent years it has been employed for the making of trimmings , bags , cushions , etc. , and has been shorn of the word " rug , " establishing itself as a new craft , useful for many purposes under the category of hooked work . The frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tambour work so perfectly in hooked work , that it is irrefutably tambour work , done in a coarse medium for rugs , requiring a greatly enlarged frame and a giant tambour needle or hook . There is no difference between a rug hook and a tambour hook , except in the size . The shank of each is fitted into a handle . The hook is pointed at the tip , which is not quite as deep as a crochet needle . The early makers of hooked rugs used to enlist the services of the village blacksmith to supply made-to-order rug hooks . He would file and re-fashion a huge handwrought nail into one and fit it into a handle , or bend the tip of a two-tined fork , after removing one tine . Rug makers have been known to put a knob of sealing-wax in lieu of a handle , onto a nail , so bent . No better description of the method of doing hooked rug work could be given than the directions for tambour work . " The thread is held between the finger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hook is inserted with the right hand and drawn through a small loop . ... The needle , in drawing up each loop , is slightly 192 HOOKED RUGS twisted by a motion which has the effect of retaining the loop on the hook . " ( " Ladies ' Manual of Fancywork , " Mrs. Pullan . ) The foundation fabric , since it must be kept stretched , is fastened into a frame , whether the work be tambour or hooked stitchery . As both hands are employed at the same time in doing either work , the frame is as essential to one as to the other craft . In hooked rug work , the pressure of the stitches , one against the other , is sufficient to make them hold fast , and produce a firm , uninterrupted surface of superimposed stitchery . In studying the evolution of stitchery it will be found that the chain-stitch of tambour work is the nucleus of another craft , namely crocheting , as well as of the stitch of the first sewing-machine . We are indebted to the ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the adaptation of the work to the making of rugs , substantial , strong and durable . It was she who skilfully transformed the ancient work into a new craft capable of using a coarse medium , and of constructing the loop pile , which was then ( 1755 ? 1830 ) being introduced into loom carpets and featured in floor coverings of the better sort . This solution to the mystery of the origin and development of the stitchery of hooked rugs is offered only after a long and close study of handicraft and handmade rugs from both Orient and Occident . But in the rugs alone , no explanation appeared . Light was gained only through the 1931 HOMECRAFT RUGS assiduous study of stitchery as such , tracing its evolution from the crudest and earliest forms , and through later developments of craft and textile . Such research supplies convincing evidence of what hooked work is and how it became a novel and separate craft . There is much controversy as to the time when the hooked rug made its initial appearance . The period of contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth . Some authorities put the date early in the eighteenth century , while others find little reason to believe that it was until the early years of the subsequent century . Proof for the first assumption would appear to be found in one rug apparently bearing the date of 1784 . The question arises , however , whether the numerals are merely consecutive figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or constitute the date 1784 . The rug field is surrounded by an alphabet border , in true sampler style . It was not unusual for samplers to furnish inspiration for such rugs . In sampler work progressive numerals were commonly employed to fill out a vacancy at the completion of an alphabet not perfectly spaced . This fact lends weight to the opinion that these figures are so used , as otherwise there would be a vacancy in the rug border . The two middle figures could as readily be 2 , 3 , as 7 , 8 , and the two end figures would be identical in either event . Had the rug been developed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen . Owing to the lack of exactness in hooked stitchery there is opportunity for such doubts . One has only to compare the date in 194 HOOKED RUGS old-time numeral formation 1784 with the figures 1234 to appreciate the similarity and to see how easy it would be for a rug maker to develop the figures in hooked stitchery so that one would scarcely be distinguishable from the other . No less an authority than Homer Eaton Keyes , known to be well versed in rug lore , as in all antiques , voices the consecutive numeral theory , upon close examination of the rug . It must be admitted that the consensus of expert opinion is in favor of a much later date for the invention of the hooked rug than would be wished by enthusiasts over these floor coverings . Those who investigate , however , must be swayed by evidence and be convinced by proof . George Francis Dow , Curator of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities , summarizes his investigations , founded on an exhaustive study of inventories , in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence to show that a hooked or braided rug was made in New England before 1800 . On the other hand , I have no definite evidence to the contrary , and they may have existed . But I do know this , that when I was a small boy even the country grocer had a stamped burlap the farmer 's wife would buy and hook into patterns provided , and these are the rugs that are now sold as antiques . This I know absolutely , and when I say small boy ' that means 187o . " In another letter to me he further writes , " Such material may have been evolved and been in use before 1800 , " and also , " My opinion is that the considerable 195II HOMECRAFT RUGS vogue of the hooked rug was after 1825 , and in this , I think all assembled evidence will back me up . " It would be difficult to learn from any one who has done more extensive research work in this matter . Therefore we may rest with the comfortable assurance that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the correct date for the period when hooked rugs were established in American homes as noteworthy furnishings of sufficient merit and value to be tabulated in inventories and bequeathed to legatees . Whatever the exact date may be for the evolution of hooked rugs and their initial appearance among American floor coverings , it is certain they are indisputably an American type of rug . There is something rather appealing in the quaint appellation " Early Colonial tapestries " of America . It conveys the pictorial element inherent in rare old tapestries and , at the same time , couples it with the idea of a sturdiness of texture and a quality of folk craftsmanship that is notably characteristic of hooked rugs . Yet there are barriers to its use , for hooked rugs are not truthfully " Early Colonial , " and the medium of rags has no kinship with tapestry mediums , which often had precious metals inwoven with the wool yarn and silken strands . There is , moreover , a type of fine loom embroidery known as American tapestry . It was developed largely under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time keenly interested in Colonial loom-woven rugs . Through her efforts a community enterprise in this 196 HOOKED RUGS rugcraft was undertaken and fostered for some time in the foothills of New York . But in this undertaking , as in all rug making enterprises , no permanency could be established . Rug making has ever prospered as a homecraft of individuality . In connection with hooked rugs and their vogue , there are definite reasons why this kind of floor covering found favor in America . Foremost among them is the rigor of the climate in the sections where these floor coverings were evolved . The extra thickness of rugs supplied warmth that was welcome . It will be remembered that the origin of pile rugs in Central Asia is ascribed to this very source ( see " Industrial Arts of India , " Sir George Birdwood ) . In American Colonial houses , draughty and lacking in the comforts of central heating , the same reason prevailed . Hooked rugs provided comfortable protection against cold floors . The period when the hooked rug came into prominence was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and incidentally to help polish the wide , planed boards . The designs traced on the sand no longer were needed to ornament the floors in most of the houses , for , during the last part of the eighteenth century , woven carpets were very generally used in the average home . These were sometimes of heavy homespun , sometimes of rag carpeting , and , in the homes of those accounted wealthy , carpets imported from Europe and England , and even from the Orient , adorned the rooms . In one of the old Colonial records there is mention of 197 HOMECRAFT RUGS an importation of " 36 yards of Brousells carpett , with border ? ? 36 " ? approximately one hundred and eighty dollars . It will be seen by this that the judge whose wife so punctiliously made this entry in her account book must have been one of the " lords of the manor " in the newly settled continent . We find an additional reason for the vogue of the hooked rug , in that it supplied a loop-pile floor covering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were copied in hooked rugs , making them somewhat akin to the type that had been engrossing the attention of loom carpet weavers during the eighteenth century . It was an achievement to construct a handcraft , loop-pile carpet . To be able to do this with the rapidity of hooked work , and at no cost , since the medium was rags , quite evidently proved a stimulus to rug makers in the home . The amazing number of genuine old hooked rugs , extant , is proof of their popularity . To this legitimate quantity , are added from time to time those artificially " antiqued " hooked rugs , against which the purchaser has to be on guard constantly . Some aids invoking the mellowing process of years in the space of a short time are by no means reprehensible as a finishing process for the rugs one makes for home use , or for sale , provided no misrepresentation as to age is attempted . Rugs can be washed , faded by exposure to sun and rain , and dipped in a solution of weak tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such treatment unjustified as a means of making colors har 198 HOOKED RUGS monize with those of a room where the rug is to be used , or to give them the esthetic quality much sought . It is only an unwarranted " trick of the trade " when such measures are in the nature of " doctoring " to fraudulently raise the price of a new rug to that of an antique . When it is discovered that a rug has been " treated , " be it an Oriental or a hooked rug , a prospective purchaser is immediately wary . There are few persons acquainted with rugs who can not detect a " doctored " rug and tell it from one toned by time . Deleterious processes are used frequently in such treatment , apart from the simple methods described . By a careful selection of colors for a new rug , the home rug maker can save herself extra trouble . The charm of hooked rugs lies chiefly in their patterns brought out in the fabric strands , for in them can be traced the undaunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty as well as practical floor coverings from rags , the one plentiful medium . The rugs were not the first textile floor coverings for their homes , but they were the first folk art handicraft carpets in which design played an appreciable part . In them the rug makers had opportunity to display artistic creative ability and to show any latent faculty for free hand drawing and geometric designing . Inspiration was drawn from many sources and was active in adapting various motifs to the purpose . It is easy to trace many of the patterns to their starting point . Patchwork quilt designs are not infrequently 199 HOMECRAFT RUGS found , and there can be little doubt but that it was from them that the simple , geometric rug patterns sprang . The rug makers had been long accustomed to copying and creating quilt patterns , and it was merely putting these same ideas to another use . Saucers , plates and bricks were the most usual objects to place on a foundation and arrange , after which a pencil or a bit of charred wood was drawn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burning wood thrust into water often supplied the charcoal , which was then sharpened to a pencil point . The straight weave of burlap or coarse homespun linen when used for rug foundations simplified the making of rectilinear designs , because , by following threads in the weave and marking them off across the length and width , squares and blocks could form patterns such as the Washington and Philadelphia Pavement , the Log Cabin , etc . Diagonal lines drawn from opposite corners of the foundation surface with lines , parallel to each , drawn at regular intervals over the foundation , made diamonds . Indeed many patterns were invented from nothing more than the geometric motifs variously combined . Some of the rules were told me by an old Nova Scotia rug maker , when we were discussing the many hooked rugs on her floors . She considered the making of a hooked rug almost too simple to be worthy of comment , and something requiring " no time at all " to do . She explained that the methods given her for rug designing had been handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " way back . " The combination of colors she had used , and the outlining of the motifs with single lines of black , indicated what could be done to lend the artistic touch to simple patterns . A border of black outlined the rugs themselves . A quaint " mosaic tile " or " Spanish tile " rug has squares of two different colors in a checker-board arrangement in the field with rectangles for a border . In each square is a sprig of berries in soft tones . Another rug , done in squares , has a grey jaspe effect in all . The hooking is done in alternate directions , horizontal and vertical and it is the very precise direction of the stitchery that supplies an interwoven decoration . Each square is outlined in dull blue and , in the centers little floral motifs are hooked in dull tones , as in the old time " penwiper " patchwork . The carpet-sized rug described was used for a number of years on the floor of the Women 's City Club on Beacon Hill , Boston , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of early New England days , now used as a lounge . The open fireplace with its series of Dutch ovens and wall closets unchanged , is featured in this room so quaintly carpeted . There is diversity of opinion as to whether the geometric hooked rug preceded or came after the floral . As no dated rug can supply evidence , conjecture fills in such a lapse . The facility with which geometric rugs can be designed is accepted as evident reason for their priority ; but there are other determining factors . The temperament of the rug maker must be taken into consideration , 202 HOOKED RUGS and her power of delineation . There were then no rug designs ready stamped . These came much later . So , when a rug was to be fashioned to fill some need , it depended upon her to create it . Her unhindered preference in design was the guide . Antique rugs indicate the freedom of choice . If she were a quilt maker , she would turn to designs typical of them . If she loved her flower garden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the blossoms growing in profusion in some welltended flower-bed , or in the gay roses that clambered over the trellised doorways . In some of the early rugs there is genuine sentiment , but no sentimentality . The latter was left for hooked rug enthusiasts of subsequent generations to instil . Another source of inspiration for hooked rug patterns was found in Brussels carpets , with their simulated Oriental patterns , also in the French Aubusson , Savonnerie and Moquette floor coverings , with their pronounced designs of roses and floral sprays , scrolls and ribbons so delicately colored in pastel shades , with just a soupcon of black to give the French zest . Many of the quaint floral hooked rugs are as much indebted to such carpet patterns and to those on other exquisite textiles as to the flowers that grew in the garden . Many hooked rugs have caught the very atmosphere that pervades fabrics and rugs from France . Oriental designs are not lacking in antique hooked rugs . The motifs quite evidently were taken from treasured " Turky Carpetts . " These rugs give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked rugs , and it is such patterns that fit into present schemes of decoration when the flaunting floral and peasant-like geometric designs are out of place . When hooked rugs are used without discrimination on floors of rooms totally at variance with their type , they express a wordless embarrassment in the incongruous setting . But hooked rugs in Oriental design and color , in fine craftsmanship , and with sheared loops of wool or yarn , are eminently suitable to the decoration of the day in which Oriental floor coverings are a pronounced feature . It is a mistake to overlook this variety of old-time hooked rug , for it is such rugs more than any others that are consistent with modern interiors . Among such rugs of distinction are those in which a family coat-of-arms is used for a central medallion . These floor coverings , although their significance is even more definite , are comparable to the coat-of-arms carpets of the Orient , in which the insignia of a country was wrought into the textile . Instances of such a use of the coat-of-arms is seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasionally , though less frequently , in some Russian rugs , and in " Turky Carpetts " also . There are sporadic instances in more modern times of coat-of-arms rugs bearing family insignia . So there is authority for these hooked rugs which are intended especially for halls , libraries , and dens . One on which the seal of a college was wrought would be excellent in a student 's room . They fit admirably into the decorative schemes of old manor houses of Colonial architecture . They are by no 204 HOOKED RUGS means unsuited to surroundings that have an Old World trend , as in certain Spanish , Old English , Normandy , etc. , interiors . The insignia immediately sets a stamp of dignity . There is a tendency to ascribe pictorial rugs to a much later date than the geometric , floral , and Oriental patterned rugs . Without refuting this in any way , it may be stated that pictorial embroideries in Europe were distinguished by just such needlework pictures , and the Moravian embroideries of Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , also featured them during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making their use on folkcraft floor coverings to be expected . In old hooked rugs there is a fascination about the very crudity of the drawing , using the curious medium of rag strands to develop the scenic effects . Such rags bespeak an era in American rugs that is not to be overlooked , for a genuine element of peasant art crept in . The pictures are realistic : frocks of girls and garb of men portray fashions in clothes ; landscapes tell of countrysides as they were ; houses are in the architecture of the period . Nothing is conventionalized as in Oriental pictorial rugs . They are real pictures , with the floor for a background instead of a wall . Occasionally hooked picture rugs are made to-day , but now they are done in fine mediums and are intended for hangings rather than carpets . They are oddities , yet when done by an artist have merit of draughtsmanship , color and construction . Nevertheless , the pictorial hooked rug // has had its day , and revival of it is neither to be expected nor desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reproductions of old types and smart period pictures . In the middle of the nineteenth century animal rugs had a vogue . In these rugs the creatures have the most distorted anatomy , because of which amusing feature they have a certain appeal . It can be for no actual beauty that they are treasured , but rather for their historic period value and the amusement they afford . Since hooked rugs permit of free-hand drawing , which is held down by no restrictions of prescribed stitchery technique , the animals lack the formal treatment found in ancient embroideries and tapestries , governed by counted threads and limitations of weave . They lose in appeal accordingly . The fashion for these rugs has gone , and if ever it does return , it is sincerely to be hoped that draughtsmanship and textile designing will be brought into play . Of the antiques , it is often the crudest delineations that attract . They have the stamp of the genuine . The rug makers quite evidently strove to portray family pets to the best of their limited ability , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine rugs are a type of pictorial floor covering now enjoying a renaissance . Once intended for the cabins of masters of ships , to-day they are the delight also of those landlubbers who love the spread of sail , the arrogant poise of the prow , the waves and the sky , all of which lend themselves admirably to pictorial purposes . These rugs fit into seaside cottages , boys ' and men 's rooms in-206 HOOKED RUGS formally treated , lake , shore and riverside homes , as well as into rooms of old-fashioned Colonial decoration . The scope of hooked design is too comprehensive for anything like a complete description in one chapter . There were sampler , map and motto rugs , good luck and welcome rugs , also rugs on which birds and feathered fowl disported themselves . And there were cut-out scroll rugs , in which the edges conformed to irregularities of the design , and also semi-circle , round , and elliptical doormats . It is quite possible that old millstones are responsible for the shape of the semicircular mat . It was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prized to-day for doorsteps to farmhouses and summer homes in the country . The old rugs were not devoid of eccentricities of technique . The embossed rug , in which motifs were in low relief against a background , found favor . These were similar to the carved Chinese rugs in the workmanship of which those Orientals excel . The reserve evidenced there was not , and is not , maintained in the hooked rug . Some of the latter have the patterns so raised from the background as to make them unfit for floor coverings . An even surface has ever been more satisfactory , for on such rugs furniture ' is not wobbly , and there is not the danger of a stumbling or unsteady tread . It is impossible , however , not to admire some of these embossed rugs when developed with the masterly skill of a competent and artistic craftsman , just as it is impossible not to deplore the bungling attempts of the inartistic . In the fine embossed floral rugs the sense of // proportion is acutely displayed , the shearing being so deftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Attention is caught by the simplicity of detail , accented just enough by the slight added height to create an atmosphere of charm and suggest the beauty found in some quaint old-fashioned garden . In tracing the various stages of design and the influences brought to bear on them in hooked rugcraft , the place occupied by Godey 's " Lady 's Book " is unique . Without ever mentioning hooked rugs , so far as a careful search has revealed , this magazine still had a decided influence on rug patterns . It did bring out designs and patterns of the time , and it is a bit puzzling to understand just why hooked rugs were neglected since the magazine made its initial appearance in 1829 , an era when hooked rugs were flourishing . There seems to be an implication that these rugs were too much a folk art , and not sufficiently " elegant " to be noticed in so exclusive and fastidious a publication . Nevertheless , by consulting the files and comparing patterns presented therein with hooked rug patterns , both in geometric figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in trends of rug design is immediately perceived . Identical designs were frequently wrested from other intended purposes and put to excellent use by the homecraft rug maker . Two such patterns are presented here from the " Lady 's Book , " being especially well suited to modern hooked rugcraft . The motifs used in combination are shown by the side of one pattern . These should 208 HOMECRAFT RUGS be cut from folded paper in the sizes desired . An entire set should be cut and assembled to insure perfect fitting together of the motifs . Then one or more sets should be cut from cardboard , and arranged on the rug foundation . Each motif should be drawn about , to leave its outline imprinted in the correct place . Cover the field of the rug with the geometric figures and inclose with a plain band for an outer border . By hooking the outlines in black and filling in the spaces with color in esthetic harmony , the effect in some instances will suggest the rich beauty of tessellation found in stained-glass windows . Another method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stencil pattern of one quarter of the rug and stencil this in four repeats , allowing for the plain border or including it in the stencil pattern . When the rug is for a bathroom or chamber , cotton is a good medium , as cotton rugs wash well . Loops should not be sheared , for cotton does not " felt , " and also because the sheared cotton pile does not withstand laundering as well as the looped . The designs per se , however , lend themselves as admirably to woolen rugs as cotton . In wool rugs the pile would be apt to be sheared . It is a question whether any hooked rug originally had the pile cut . It may be that , after use , the rug colors lost their freshness , and to restore them to their pristine clearness the rug maker resorted to snipping off the tops of the loops . This would bring a new strata of the textile to the light . There are two outstanding reasons for the soundness of the theory of the uncut preceding the cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hooked work evolved was of loop formation , and the loop pile was in vogue at the time when hooked rugs sprang into existence , and part of the object of such rugs was to create the impression of loom-woven floor coverings . On the other hand , the fact that those who wanted to simulate " Turky Carpetts " would shear the loops can not be disregarded . The knot carpet had been made in Europe as well as in Asia , and this invariably has the cut pile . In power-loom carpets it was possible to get a splendid surface of uncut pile . It had the appeal of novelty as well as suitability and became a vogue partly for this reason , also partly because of the exigencies of carpet machinery . It must be remembered that machine-made floor coverings were the things to have at that time . Their popularity so threatened handmade carpets that it was thought they would be driven out of existence . But time can be relied upon to prove the stability of a product , and so to-day the handmade rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demand than before . The tables are reversed . To-day it is the pride of carpet manufacturers to make perfect reproductions of handmade carpets , rather than of rug makers to attempt machine effects in handicraft rugs . 211 HOMECRAFT RUGS PART II EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION The equipment for hooked rugcraft consists of a rug frame , a rug hook , a patterned foundation , and working medium . To this it is advisable to add a pair of shears with curved tips , or with blades on a lower level than the handles , which are bent at angles to give the desired shape . These types are used by Oriental rug makers . Those with curved tips are also known as surgical shears . Prices of these types of scissors are not more than those of regu lation shears of like grade . 212 HOOKED RUGS Of the several kinds of rug frames , the most convenient are those with collapsible standards , for they do away with the necessity of fixing chair backs or saw horses for frame rests . The collapsible standard frames belong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be folded flat and put behind doors or in closets , without occupying any appreciable space . Prices for these frames vary according to models and grades of materials used in construction . As they can be had as low as frames minus standards , the price is no barrier . A simple frame that anyone can make consists of four strips of seven-eighths or one inch boards , two inches wide . Two of the strips should be forty or fifty inches long . These are called " carriers , " because they come at top and bottom of the frame and hold or " carry " the rug , which , if too long to be entirely exposed , is wound about one or the other , as the rug maker prefers , while the part exposed is worked . Afterward the rug is readjusted by rolling the worked part about the other carrier and positioning an unworked portion . The two shorter strips are called " stretchers . " They are eighteen or twenty inches long and are side pieces , holding the frame extended . Four large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cents each , are needed to fasten corners of the frame securely at right angles . There are finer frames with mortised carriers , through which are run spreaders , having , at each end , six or more auger holes bored at distances of one-half to one inch apart . Pegs , fitted into corresponding holes in the spread-213 HOMECRAFT RUGS ers after the frame is put together , hold strips at perfect right angles . Another model of frame has a stationary peg one or one and one-half inches from each end of the spreaders . Auger holes in carriers are fitted over the pegs when the frame is set up and a shutter or latch holds them firmly in place . Both of these rug frames are excellent and can also be made at home , though not quite as easily as the first . To insure straight rugs , it is imperative that corners be at absolute right angles when frames are " squared . " Three types of rug hooks are in common use , and a fourth , which is a mechanical substitute called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle . A rug maker should choose the kind best suited to her hand and method of work . The metal should be well tempered , and the wooden handles smooth . One model is straight , another has an angular shank , while the shank of a third is curved . Besides the regulation shapes of handles , one comes broad , curved and flattened at the top like a doorknob . The straight shank is short . When in use , the handle is grasped with the right hand in such a way that the top fits into the palm of the hand . The straight hook is held with the thumb and fingers of the right hand . Both this and the hook just described are held vertically over a rug when the hook is pushed through the foundation , but by a twist of the wrist are turned at an angle , when a loop is drawn through the fabric . The handle of the bent hook is encircled with the 214 HOOKED RUGS thumb and fingers of the right hand , held palm down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hook is pushed through the foundation by turning the hand toward the thumb , and is raised , after the loop has been caught , by turning the hand from the wrist back toward the little finger . // The shapes of hooks themselves vary . The usual one has a rather shallow croche and quite pointed tip . It comes in two or more sizes for coarse and fine mediums . A rug crochet hook is precisely like a regulation crochet hook made of steel . The shank is fitted into a wooden handle . It is made to supply a demand of rug makers who prefer a crochet needle to a rug hook for the craft . For some mediums , the number ten aluminum , or metal composition , crochet hook is admirably suited to hooked rugcraft . Such a hook does not pierce the strands of a foundation textile , nor separate filaments of mediums , however lightly twisted , such as rope jute , roving , etc . The immense popularity of hooked rugs is responsible for the invention of a mechanical device for producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the tool , but it is a misnomer to call it a hook , as it has none , a variety of needle taking its place . Rugs made with the punch needle , however good they may be , are therefore mechanical replicas , not genuine hooked rugs , though they have the same loop structure . The punch needle comes in many forms , but in each the principle is the same ? the automatic , mechanical feeding of the medium through the threaded tool into the fabric . Primarily this was all that the needle did , but almost immediately a gage was added whereby , with no other care on the part of the rug maker than the initial one of fastening the stitch regulator to suit the height of the loop determined upon , the stitches would be auto 216 HOOKED RUGS matically of the same size and the pile unvariable . As will be seen , the sole remaining handicraft element left for the rug maker to instil into her work is the spacing and direction of the stitchery . The work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiosyncrasies and discrepancies that are the proof and charm of handmade articles . The technique of the punch needle differs from that of the rug hook in that , with the former , work is done on the wrong side and with the latter on the right . The pattern to be done is uppermost , but the tool pushes the loops through and they remain on the under side which becomes the right side . The value of the punch needle lies in the rapidity with which the work can be accomplished . This is a point that can not be overlooked in modern times , when speed is a force and effect an object . Cost does not enter into the consideration , as the punch loop rug costs as much as the others to make . The punch needle has its excellent uses , however , in reproducing rugs where the mechanical precision of stitchery is an asset . It is well employed , therefore , in the making of floor coverings simulating cut pile loom carpets , such as Moquette . These can be fashioned in rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when yarn is the medium . Distinctly modern rugs , suited to up-to-date interiors , are easily possible to make . The foundation of any hooked rug is of prime importance , since the life of the rug is dependent upon the // durability of this fabric . A heavy homespun linen is best , and is found in many antiques . To-day it is considered too costly . A rather coarse , not too closely woven , machine-made linen is a good second choice , but burlap is the most usual and has been from the first . It has the necessary straight weave , while the loose texture permits the crowding of stitches without straining the textile nor tiring the hand when hooking through it . The regularity of the weave facilitates laying of patterns . Suitable mediums arc numerous , such as rags , rug yarn , and ordinary yarn in two or more strands , roving , jute , ( rope or three-ply ) , candle wicking , chenille , carpet raveling , raveled out knit or crocheted woolen garments , sweaters , scarfs , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is fabric , and bears the commonplace and inadequate name of rags ; but if these are thought of as worn fragments of old clothes , we must revise our conception of what rug rags are , lest threadbare pieces of material be used in which the wearing quality is gone . Rugs made from such textiles have little or no durability . In the lore of rugs , the word rags means either new stock or the strong and good parts of garments discarded because they no longer fulfill their purpose as wearing apparel . The reason for so considering them may be that the garments are out of style , faded , worn in some places only while strong in others , or it may be that the wearer has tired of them after their serving well for a sufficiently long time . Or the goods may be in faded or spotted pieces , not fit for other use than in rug strands . These 218 HOOKED RUGS blemishes are no barrier to rug making , for faded goods appear mellowed , and spots give a stippled effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought expressly for the rugcraft , and selvages procured by the pound from mills are to-day frequently used . Indeed there is a growing tendency to buy mediums . Correct amounts can be obtained in just the right colors without having to resort to the dye pot , and strips can be rapidly torn in lengths suitable for the work . In olden times , when rug makers spun the yarn for weaving , and home dyeing was a necessity , the first use of the textiles was for far different articles than floor coverings made of torn strips of cloth . To put new cloth into rugs was an unindulged extravagance , and hooked rugs were distinctly thrifty floor coverings . But it can not be denied that home makers realized that carpets , as well as clothes , were essential to comfort , and many garments would have proved wearable longer if the women did not have an eye to their excellence in rugs . To-day hooked rugs are thriftily made of discarded garments or made of new cloth economically bought , or of mediums other than textiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a quaint charm about the term that suits the craft of the early American colonists , and it is this that one is loath to forfeit even in idea , although mediums sometimes are as fine as specially made all-wool rug yarns . The present vogue for hooked rugs has brought out so many stamped burlap patterns , that there is a tendency 219 HOMECRAFT RUGS to use them rather than to create individual designs . It was so in the vogue of 187o , which accounts for crudity in many antiques of that era . This tendency is unfortunate , as it robs the floor coverings of distinction and the rug maker of an essential interest in her work ? that of creating beauty . The first hooked rug makers designed as well as executed . Apart from the patterns which are drawn free-hand , or made by copying or tracing about such commonplace objects as compasses , bricks , plates , baskets , flowers , etc. , other patterns can be adapted , and designs created from simple motifs . This is so easy to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by following directions that are given . Oriental motifs can be traced from rugs or first taken off by counted stitches on draughting paper ruled in squares , as for cross stitch . These motifs can be cut from cardboard and arranged on a rug field . A few motifs scattered over a field and surrounded by one or more borders , all done in Oriental colors , will make an attractive rug . Caucasian and Chinese rugs are particularly good types to simulate , as their motifs are . bold and easy to copy . Large diamonds can be arranged on a field ( see mosaic rug diagrams ) and a few Oriental motifs can be inclosed in each , with the field outside left in plain color . For borders , use two or more simple border motifs hooked in different colors on a plain background and edge each border with a line of contrasting color . Excellent results will be gained ? always providing color schemes are 220 HOOKED RUGS Oriental . These rugs are stressed because of their adaptability to modern schemes of interior decoration . Patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book covers , rug designs , pictures , etc. , as a copying artist squares off a painting . The rug foundation is divided by horizontal and vertical lines into square sections , each one corresponding to a like division that may or may not be visibly measured on the surface being copied . If the original can not be marked off , cover it with tracing paper and square that . In each section of the rug foundation , draw the outline that occupies the same section in the picture . This is one of the simplest methods of copying , whereby enlarging can be done accurately and simultaneously with the first drawing . It has only to be tried to prove its efficacy . Folded patterns or motifs can be used to-day as acceptably as by old-time hooked rug designers . This method is one of the oldest known to rugcraft ( see Chapter XVII , " Old Patchwork for New Rugs " ) . After opening out the motifs , cut duplicates from cardboard and arrange them on the foundation fabric . Trace around them with a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India ink , liquid bluing , or any stain . Arrange in design form , and enclose the field with one or more borders . One quarter of a pattern can be designed and a stencil cut from it where duplication of sections is desirable . This method can be employed when designing rugs in some of the other crafts . A little experimenting in draughting one 's own patterns 22I HOMECRAFT RUGS will give the needed skill . Certainly if , in olden times , rug makers were venturesome enough to create their own patterns , modern rug makers should not be more timid . If the result is not satisfactory in the first instance , reverse the foundation fabric and make a new design . An added interest centers in rugcraft when both design and workmanship are by the rug maker . When the rug pattern has been developed and outlined on the foundation , it must be fastened into the rug frame before the process of hooking can be begun . There are three methods of securing a foundation to a frame . Each is given in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacked in , sewed in , or lashed in , after being bound , hemmed or overcast . The pattern may completely cover the foundation or occupy but a portion of it only , as in oval , semicircular , round , half oval rugs , or those with irregular edges , as instanced in some scroll patterns . A frame requires no special preparation when the foundation is to be tacked to it . Use substantial thumbtacks , or short tacks with flat , rather large heads , easily removed with a tack lifter , and do not put them in close together . The foundation textile , turned in along the edge for extra strength , must extend beyond the pattern far enough for the hooking to be done to the line of the rug . It is impossible to take the stitches through the fabric on a line touching the frame . When a foundation is to be sewed to a frame , it is necessary to nail the edges of a fold of ticking or one edge of carpet binding to each carrier strip . The binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame . If the foundation is not hemmed or bound along the line of the rug , but has some goods extending beyond it , the foundation may overlap the strips and be held to them with running stitches . The pattern on the foundation must not be so close to the textile on the frame that the latter would interfere with the hooked stitchery . If the rug is hemmed or otherwise finished on a line with the pattern , then it must be sewed to the binding on the frame with stitches long enough to allow some space between the binding and the rug foundation . A fagoting stitch is used . In this way the hooking is kept free from the textile nailed to the frame . If a foundation is lashed to a frame , each strip of wood is wound with carpet binding or strips of stout cloth that does not fray . The binding must not interfere with auger holes or pegs . The foundation when lashed in does not touch the frame , but is kept sufficiently far from it by the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very edge of the foundation . Therefore , rugs so fastened to a frame are generally finished along the edge of the rug . Stitches are taken first at rug corners , securing them in position . Then from one corner , with a large needle , threaded with very coarse cotton or carpet thread , doubled , the foundation is caught with a short stitch . The thread is then run in a slightly diagonal direction over the frame and through the foundation . This process is continued from corner to corner . The taut thread presses against the wound frame and stitches are held securely . // A favored method of fastening rugs to frames is to secure the top and bottom of the foundation , however finished , to the carriers . Then the stretchers are put in position and fastened at exact right angles . If the rug is longer than the stretchers , the foundation is rolled about the top or bottom carrier until it is short enough to be stretched smooth and even when the stretchers are in position . When the exposed part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , and the foundation already worked wound about the opposite stretcher until another section of unworked foundation is exposed for hooking . Then the frame is again set up . Frequently a rug is removed and its position shifted without taking the frame apart . Craftsmen who make a business of selling the rugs they make frequently have extra large frames in which rugs of carpet size ( six by nine feet ) can be stretched full length . The pattern must always be uppermost when a foundation is in a frame . Always fasten corners of rugs to frames before sewing the edges . To center a foundation perfectly , double it and position the middle spot of the edge to the middle spot on the frame . When secured , draw the foundation edges from the central fastening to each corner and position them . Then fasten the foundation between points . A method that has been found satisfactory by the writer is to turn rug edges along the pattern line , over the right side of the foundation and stitch flat , either by running stitches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 HOMECRAFT RUGS an inch wider than the pattern and the edges overcast . Cut away the textile that overlaps at corners and overcast the diagonal lines to form a trim mitre . When a rug is hooked , the edges are neat . A foundation so finished can be fastened to a frame in any of the ways given , where an extra foundation edge is not needed . When the rug foundation , pattern uppermost , has been centered and set up in a frame which has been adjusted to an easy height for the rug maker , the operation of hooking in the medium conveniently at hand , should start . The position of the hand differs according to the type of hook used ( see page 215 ) . It is well to place on one corner of the foundation some lengths of medium in colors that will soon be needed to carry out the design . These should be constantly replenished as the hooking proceeds . The medium itself may be narrow or wide . The size of it is more responsible than anything else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches coarse or fine . In preparing rags it is well to have an approximate gage for widths of them and to know how best to insure even sizes . A firm woolen textile , such as ordinary-weight flannel , can be cut as narrow as onequarter inch , and this is the weight of cloth best suited to hooking . All textiles used together must approximate the same sized strand , even though thinner cloth may have to be two or three times as wide . Whenever possible , strips should be cut or torn lengthwise of the material , and it is best to have them not more than one and one 226 HOOKED RUGS half yards long . Few woolen textiles , less than one-quarter inch wide can stand the strain of hooking . They are likely to pull apart and separate . When cotton goods the weight of chambray is the medium , the width of strips advised is one-half inch . As cotton folds and creases under pressure and has not the resilience of woolen textiles , the effect of the two widths in the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be remembered that there is no hard and fast rule for widths . The discretion of the rug maker must be used . And she may decide to use either finer or coarser strands than mentioned if she makes a rug of very fine or very coarse stitchery . In some instances different widths are used in one rug , a fine short cotton loop sometimes but three-sixteenths inch high forming the background for a design in coarser cut woolen pile . Hold the medium to be hooked in the left hand between the thumb and forefinger and close to the foundation beneath the place where the stitchery is to be done . The hook is held in the right hand over the stitch spot . The tip is pressed through the foundation and the medium is caught by the hook , which is then pulled up , bringing with it the end of the medium . The first and last stitch of any medium is always a tip of the strand . A stitch must never end on the wrong side of a rug . Each stitch , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a small loop drawn through the foundation . The loop three-eighths inch high is approved , but onequarter inch loops are frequently found . Even shorter // loops are used at times when strips are very narrow . Embossed patterns have the loops even higher , to allow for rounded shearing effects . A little knack that the writer has found helpful is to press the hook against the foundation when drawing it up with the loop , so that the opening is slightly enlarged , permitting the curved part of the hook to come through without a hitch . The stitch is taken precisely as for tambour work , even to the twist of the wrist . Only a few threads of foundation should be allowed between stitches , as it is the pressure of one stitch against another that alone is responsible for the firmness of the superimposed surface of pile . A coarse medium occupies more space than a fine one and necessitates stitches being set farther apart . Also , the coarser medium naturally calls for a higher loop . An uncut pile is shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra depth should be given to allow for shearing . Hooking should progress in a general way from right to left , and from edges toward the center . Designs are outlined , however , before being filled in , and it is often wise to fill in motifs and then do the background around them . Even so , a general direction toward the left and also toward the center can be followed . By working from the edge to the center , any puckering of the goods that might otherwise occur along the edges is averted . It is the practise of the writer to make one border , or at least three rows of hooking , around the edge of each exposed rug surface before filling in any of the field . 228 HOOKED RUGS Rug makers , however , are privileged to suit their own preference in the method of hooking . For instance , some rug makers work half the exposed surface in a frame and then turn the frame and do the other half . Some work in rows , some with stitches purposely set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exactly the same height , and some deliberately vary them . The direction of the stitchery can supply interesting variety to hooked rug surfaces , while differing heights of loops in sheared rugs allow occasional shorter loops to remain uncut . This is thought to supply extra strength . Loops should certainly be uneven and many left uncut in a cotton rug that is sheared , as cotton does not felt , but merely frays . A frayed pile is not especially durable , while a felted pile is . The wise rug maker shears woolen pile , and leaves cotton and jute in loops . The uncut loop pile is also capable of great diversity of effect . Loops may be very short and close , making a fine compact surface , or long and close , making a rug of deep pile . They may be short and of wide span , giving a flat effect , quickly achieved , or both length and span can be increased for even coarser results . To make a knot-tied hooked rug pile , follow the instructions for tambour work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short . After drawing the first loop through the foundation , do not let it slip off the shank of the hook , but keep it on the needle . When drawing the second loop through , also catch the short end of the strand left hanging when the first stitch was 229 HOMECRAFT RUGS taken . Draw both through the loop on the shank . Clip the ends and pull to make a tight knot . It will be seen that it takes two operations to complete one stitch . Repeat throughout the rug surface . Although this is a simple stitch , it takes far more time to fashion than the plain loop , without giving greater beauty or more durability . It is not surprising , therefore , that the knot-tied pile was seldom used in hooked rugcraft . Whatever the kind of hooked rug chosen for making , a hint to the amateur craftsman will prove helpful . Avoid too great precision of stitchery . It is not to be found in antique hooked rugs , and these are the correct models to follow . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women was engaged to make hooked rugs . It would have proved a lucrative occupation if rightly pursued . Everything of the best was put into their hands ? fine wools , excellent designs , and correct patterns . Yet their work was a failure . This was because the women refused to grasp the fact that they were making folkcraft rugs and not reproductions of machine-made floor coverings . The precision of their work , with its parallel lines of straight stitchery , had no charm nor appeal . It was not true to type , and the enterprise had to be abandoned . A community enterprise which did enjoy an artistic success was that of the Sabatos Rug , under the direction of Mrs. Douglas Volk . The name was taken from Mt . Sabatos , Maine , where the work was done . Mrs. Volk developed a method of knot-tied pile that brought her 230 HOOKED RUGS into prominence in the forwarding of this community work in rugcraft . The name " Sabatos Rugs , " therefore , stands for a specific type of hooked rug of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the yarn . Another venture worthy of mention was promoted by Helen Albee , in what were known as the Abnakee rugs . In them Mrs. Albee sought to raise the standard of hooked rag rugs , rather than to forward any different kind of stitchery in her community enterprise . Her group was established at Pequaket , New Hampshire , where the Pequaket tribe of the Abnaqui Indians had been wont to roam . The name Abnaqui appealed to Mrs. Albee , who modernized the spelling and adopted it for her rug work . Wool rags and burlap foundations were the basis of the craft in which handsome hooked rugs of both loop and sheared pile were fashioned . The shearing of a rug , of whatever sort , is a task for an expert . An evenly cut pile can be had only by very careful manipulation of the scissors . The final cutting of the pile of an Oriental rug is considered so particular an operation that a mechanical device has been invented , and is frequently used on modern Eastern carpets . This is mentioned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deftness . Part of the knack of shearing hooked loops is to run the finger under the rug where the pile is being cut , elevating it a trifle . Only the tip of the loop must be snipped off , thus separating the loop into two strands . 231 HOMECRAFT RUGS The scissors with angular handles , or those with the curved blades ( surgical scissors ) are recommended . They are used by Oriental rug makers . The blades in the first type skim the surface evenly as the shears are manipulated , while the hand working them rests on the rug . This is possible , as the handles are on a higher level than the blades . The pile should not be raised , as suggested , when these scissors are used . The danger of gouging the pile of a rug is eliminated when these or curved shears are employed , for the tips do not enter the pile . Shearing rugs with ordinary scissors is precarious work , and should be left to experienced rug makers , should they choose to use such shears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be on a lower level than the motifs , and therefore clipped closer . The motifs should have been hooked in higher loops . The pile is often graduated from the background level to surprising heights in the middle of a design . This high relief work is bizarre and done to impress the uninitiate with the skill of the rug maker more than for any other reason . Fancy shearing is not an idea peculiar to hooked rug makers . It is one of the Chinese methods , also to be found in a very limited number of Anatolian rugs . It was abandoned in the latter rugs , and is done in a very reserved way , only , by the Chinese . If the Oriental rug makers discard this fancy " carved " or embossed clipped pile , hooked rug makers can do no better than to follow their example , for they are the finest creators of handmade 232 HOOKED RUGS rugs the world has ever produced . It is the pile of the Oriental rug that all other pile rugs are fashioned after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reflect some of the same beauty . When rags are the medium , the rugs have their own distinct individuality , quaint and interesting . While it is customary to have rug edges hemmed or bound , occasionally rugs are lined . Denim and ticking make stout linings . Carpet-size hooked rugs are made in breadths and seamed together like pile carpets . Hold the widths together with right sides facing each other . Overhand the seams , taking but a few threads up in each stitch . When a few stitches , or a short needleful , has been done in one direction , reverse the order of stitches to give a crossed stitch . The seam must be so narrow that it will flatten out when breadths are opened . Carpet breadths are sewed by counted threads , thus insuring perfect joining of design motifs , and the sewing of hooked carpets should follow this same method . When a rug edge is finished , after being taken from a frame , the foundation , cut one inch wider than the rug , is turned back and hemmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before turning , and a binding tape be sewed flat over it . Rugs with curved , or irregular edges frequently need to have little V-shaped pieces snipped from the turned-in edges to make them lie absolutely flat . When this is the case , the rug must be finished off with a flat binding , sewed carefully over the turned-in edge . 233 HOMECRAFT RUGS The hooked rug maker who creates her own designs and works them deftly in well chosen colors , can have as fine examples of work as did the old rug makers . These new rugs , also , may be accounted worthy of being inventoried and bequeathed to future generations . 234J XIII FABRIC MOSAIC RUGS COMMONLY CALLED BUTTON , SPOOL , OR DOLLAR RUGS The spool , button , or dollar rug is , of structural necessity , a mosaic floor covering , the segments of which are fabric instead of marble , stone , glass , etc . Each bit of material is carefully fitted with the others , and firmly set with stitches . In rugs that have any pretense to beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to a pattern . In the old Colonial rugs this invariably assumed geometric proportions , diamonds of large or small size being most in favor . While there is a quaint charm about these rugs , the idea that thrift was the inspiration is ever present . One can scarcely disregard the evident skilful use of scraps of available material . Yet one 's heart rather warms toward the woman who , in order to add warmth to draughty floors and decoration to barren boards , contrived to fashion , from what she had , something to fill her needs . The button rugs certainly are ingenious and often have an appeal because of the colors in kaleidoscopic harmony . There must also be precision of design . The names by which the rug is familiarly known ? button , dollar , and spool ? are nothing if not prosaic . Yet they are not minus individuality ; and one , the dollar rug , has a note of historic interest . It was so named be-235 HOMECRAFT RUGS cause the silver dollar was employed as a pattern mold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " cartwheel " dollars , then made of silver , are now out of coinage , being too cumbersome to be practical , as their nickname implies . But they made excellent rug pattern molds ! One is a little at a loss to comprehend why the rugs were not called coin rugs , since those making them took two or three kinds of coin for pattern molds , according to whether there were two or three discs centered one above the other . Perhaps more affluence was expressed by the word " dollar " than by " coin , " which might have been interpreted to mean mere " cent . " The names " button " and " spool " were acquired through the use of each as a pattern mold , and three different sizes were usually employed . There is found in all of these names a curious tendency to subordinate the structural character of the rug and to emphasize , not the pattern , but the object used for the pattern motif . The fact that the rug makers were actually employing a classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to have entered their minds . Yet it harks back to primitive , mosaic floor ornamentation , choice in design and superb in color . Mediums were varied to conform to the special application of the mosaic and it is in this respect that the mosaic rug is distinctive . It shows a transition akin to that which took place in the prehistoric era , during which stone work achieved the artistry that was later applied to textiles . The tesserae are of fabric in mosaic rugs . X2361 FABRIC MOSAIC RUGS It is when these rugs take on the character of historic ornament that they reach their summit of perfection . Since this does not increase the work of the rug maker , nor add to the cost of the finished floor covering , there seems to be every reason in favor of spool rugs taking a new lease on life , as mosaic rugs , in which there is no hint of economy . Instead , there is a charm inherent in the antique background to set off to best advantage fine rugs in this structurally correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient mosaic floor , over two thousand years old , revealed by excavations in Pompeii , and is copied as exactly as the circular spool motif permits . Those familiar with the " Cave Canem " ( beware the dog ! ) mosaic will appreciate the fidelity of the reproduction . This famous design , with its caption , is inlaid in the threshold of a doorway leading from the vestibulum into a Pompeian bath or atrium , which was a main room of the house . It formed a salutation to guests or strangers , just as did the words " Ave " or " Have " which are often found . Friends evidently accepted the " Cave Canem " in the good spirit of those who appreciate that the dog of the household as well as the owner is a friend , while an importunate stranger might enter with a little hesitancy . The original use of the mosaic design supplies a precedent for its present application to fabric mosaic rugs for vestibules , or outer halls , and the more spacious main entrance halls in modern homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimsical 237 HOMECRAFT RUGS as well as classic character . It gives those who have traveled through Italy an immediate feeling of rapport , as they cross the threshold , being a floor covering of note to any one who has once seen it . It has the " smart " element that comes from decoration that is at once striking and suitable . To complete the similarity of this replica to its original , it is developed in black and white fabric tessera , the dog and its confining leash being silhouetted in black against a white background . The spots on the dog 's body and the sharp shadows of the forelegs are done in dark grey . However , this color scheme does not necessarily have to be copied , provided such colors as are substituted are in accord with ancient mosaic work . A grey , somewhat lighter in tone than the shadow , and like the grey of the marble , can be used in place of white in the field of the rug ; or an old gold tone , recalling the gold so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But two tones should be used , one modified for shadows and markings of the dog . Nothing is any way approximating dainty colors should ever be found in this or the other salutation rugs mentioned . " Salve " is another salutation mosaic , lettered in black with a simple fret or Grecian border that can well be copied . It is in the vestibule floor of a grand mansion of an old New England estate , still preserved in its magnificence . One could not fail to recognize at a glance that the owners were much traveled persons . As a little child I can remember being impressed by the strangeness of the 238
