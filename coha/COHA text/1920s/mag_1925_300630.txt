The retrial of onetime Captain Jacques Sadoul , who was sentenced to death in absentio in 1919 for deserting to the Bolsheviki while a member of the French Military Mission , began at Orlans . <P> Sadoul , a debonair , middle-aged man , stirred the court and all France by declaring that " it is fantastic to realize that it is yet unknown that , after they came into power , Lenin and Trotzy never ceased to appeal to France for military support that would enable them to resume the war against Germany . " <P> He went on to charge ex-Premier Georges Clemenceau with responsibility for the Brest-Litovsk Treaty ( treaty of peace signed between Russia and Germany in 1918 ) and for " the death of several hundred thousands of soldiers . " It was thought extremely unlikely that he could prove that Clemenceau actually did refuse military aid to the Bolsheviki , although Sadoul averred that documentary evidence existed . <P> In the course of the proceedings , the prisoner referred to his exile ( 1919 to 1924 ) : <P> " Exile has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist , an excellent internationalist , but I am first of all a Frenchman , a product of France according to the theory of Taine . I have seen apple trees in the Crimea , but they are not to be compared to the apple trees of Normandy . " <P> Then , with an airy flourish of his right hand : " I have this to say in conclusion : Only revolution can save France . " <P> The court voted adjournment of the trial . Sadoul was given temporary liberty pending continuance of the hearing . He scurried off to Paris , visited Communist friends in the Chamber of Deputies , received a great ovation.
