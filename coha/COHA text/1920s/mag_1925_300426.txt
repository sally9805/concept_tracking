Mr. Chamberlain , M. Briand and Herr Stresemann , respectively the Foreign Ministers of Britain , France and Germany , set out last week with a host of lesser diplomats for the little village of Locarno , Switzerland , to try to negotiate a security pact which has as its essence the definite guaranteeing of the peace of the Rhineland . Their chances of success and the form which the fruits of their negotiations would take were contrarily predicted as follows : <P> Optimists declared that as a minimum of accomplishment a pact would be signed between Britain , France , Belgium and Germany , which would achieve the following results : 1 ) Guarantee mutually the peace and status quo of the Rhine frontier ; 2 ) Bring Germany at once into the League of Nations , with the rights and obligations of a member state ; Force Germany to make arbitration treaties between herself and the Allied powers ; as well as treaties mutually guaranteeing her western frontiers with Poland and Czecho-Slovakia , and providing for arbitration in that section also . <P> Pessimists declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , out of which a basis for the drafting of subsequent treaties at subsequent conferences may or may not arise . They made the following observations : 1 ) Germany , early last week , attempted to inject a denial of her War guilt and a request for the evacuation of Cologne by the Allies into her acceptance of the Allied invitation to Locarno . She was promptly squelched by diplomatic reprimands from Allies , and is coming to the conference anyway . But , Stresemann should insist on introducing either of these matters at the conference , matters might go to smash on that alone*2 ) Although Germany is apparently not heeding Russia 's menacing suggestions that she had best keep away from a Locarno pact ( see RUSSIA ) , she can not but be . influenced by so powerful a neighbor and may be able to play off the Russian threat as a reason for acceding to some or all of the demands of the Allies ; 3 ) Previous conferences have failed ; those at Genoa , Cannes and The Hague broke up , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all concerned . <P> <P> *The Treaty of Versailles explicitly saddles Germany with the necessity of making restitution for the destruction i wrought during the War because she was guilty of starting it . The whole structure of reparations has been said to rest upon this point .
