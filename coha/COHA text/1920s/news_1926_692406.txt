txt When a pool accumulates large amounts of stock on the way up the buying generally proves easier than the selling . There are pools that are called successful because they are able to mark up their stocks day after day with little reaction . But these claims of success are in ninny cases premature , as success depends on the ability of the pool to liquidate at a profit . Lately some pools seem to have experienced trouble finding buyers . But a little setback for some of the more doubtful issues that have been soaring skyward is not an unhealthy development for the better class of stocks . Most of the financial writers have arrived at the conclusion that the decline in the market has been due to a weak technical condition . A better explanation would he that the decline in the market has been due to shrewd professional traders concluding that the market was wens technically , and making haste to prove their contention . onsolidated Mining &; Smelting , of Canada , sold at a hew h:gh level of $237 a share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is credited with owning about 50% of the stock . Therefore Canadian Pacific 's market holdings now have a paper value of $59,250,000 . There are 2,600,000 shares of Canadian Pacific outstanding , so that the value of Consolidated Mines is equal to about $23 a share on Canadian Pacific stock . It has been reported from time to time that Canadian Pacific might distribute its Smelting holdings to shareholders , but these rumors have been denied . A dividend in Consolidated Smelters stock would be equal to about $23 a share , which would bring Canadian Pacific stock , ex its mining stock , down to $134 a share , a pretty low price for railroad stock paying $10 a share annually . Many lenders of money are asking borrowers to sweeten their collateral with more digestible products . If the decline was not due to Vaal liquidation , the turning point will come when some of the big shorts think it prudent to cover . It will be noticed that while the railroad shares declined in the recent reaction , the extent of the loss has been comparatively small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to the price you paid for them in case of a severe decline . The action of the market yesterday and the day before seemed to bear out the contention that a great deal of the selling Saturday and Monday was for short accounts . When shorts began to look around for offering prices they found little stock available . This was particularly true of Can , which came within a point or so of reaching a new high record . Another strong feature was Hudson Motors , up 4 points . Tobacco stocks were firm , and so were the rails on more cheerful news from Washington relative to the merger , situation .

TELEPII0 When the market was declining Mond.ay someone said it was rumored that American Telephone &; Telegraph would do some new financing . Perhaps someone was short of the stock and hoped it would go with the rest . But , instead , Telephone moved up to the highest price on record . Telephone has a way of doing things contrary to expectations . Rumors that A. T. &; T. is to do financing no longer have any influence on the stock . The worst news would be an announcement that Telephone would never again do any financing . That would be an admission that the telephone industry had reached the peak , and this indeed would be a strange happening . As long as the population of the country grows Telephone will grow . The demands upon surplus earnings will continue greater than the company can satisfy and new financing from time to time is inevitable . Company is not contemplating any such action at present .

Yet Intercontinental was able to show , 1.50 on its stock .
