txt Preliminary income account of the Haiti:bore &; Ohio for 1920 , with December partly estimated , shows a surplus over all charges and preferred dividends of $5,544,169 , or 3.64% on the $151.90,000 common stock , as compared with 86,175,089 or 4.06% in 1919 . Eliminating lapoter charges front both accounts , the percentages earned on stock would be 4.1 and 5.15 respectively . This income statement for 1920 , the first to be made up by any large railroad , is made up by combining the federal compensation for eight months and the net from operations for the last four months . It is worth noting that the net operating income iWr September and October . the first two months of operation under the new freight and passenger rates , represent annual earnings of approximately 5f ' 0 on the common stock . The earnings position of B. &; 0 . is , however , more favorable than it has yet appeared to be from any formal statements . Operating economies put into practice by the management since November 1 will be found to have cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . On an annual basis such retrenchment would mean anywhere from $10,000.000 to $15,000,000 a year . Some I part , but of course not all , of the effects of these measures will be reflected in the November earnings statement , to appear within a week or ten days . Traffic shrinkage must naturally be offset against these indicated gains in net , but it is apparent that unless the business of the country falls off to a degree not now indicated the B. &; 0 . is going to make some satisfactory earnings reports in the next few months . The road 's total traffic is still holding up close to that of this time last year , but the character of the tonnage is undergoing changes . Merchandise and miscellaneous traffic has declined , while the coal movement is much heavier than a year ago and steel products are moving freely . So far as the company 's cash position is concerned it is in good shape . It has no floating debt and its balance due the Government for improvements made during federal control amounting roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 , when final settlement of accounts is completed . Equipment ordered this year is to be paid for partly through an advance from the Government loan fund and partly by means of equipment trust certificates to be issued through the National Service Corporation , an offshoot of the Association of Owners of Railroad Securities . In the two years ending this month the company has been in receipt of surplus income of $5,683,399 over and above all interest charges and other deductions , preferred dividends and one semi-annual payment on the common in 1919 ? that is. that sum has been available from income for capital purposes or additional working capital . It will be supplemented the coming year by a further sum which I can hardly be less than $7.000,000 and may run to $10,000. - 000 or more .
