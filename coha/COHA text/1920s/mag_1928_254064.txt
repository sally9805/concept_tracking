's : " In place of Federal prohibition we favor the installation , by the States , of a method of controlled and restricted distribution which will prevent the exploitation of the liquor traffic for unconscionable profits , and not only do away with prevailing speakeasies and secret drinking but prevent the reappearance of the old unregulated saloon system and the political iniquities which accompanied it . " <P> Chairman John J. Raskob , of the Finance Committee of General Motors Corpn. , is another new A. A. P. A. director . Returning from Europe , he found letters from many a Prohibitionist enquiring why he opposed them . He singled out Patrick H. Callahan , a Kentucky varnish-maker ( Louisville ) , a boss Democrat and , like Mr. Raskob , Roman Catholic , for reply . <P> Mr. Raskob wrote : " I am not a drinking man ( this does not mean that I never take a drink ) , am a director in corporations employing over 300,000 workmen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to 21 years . The thing that is giving me the greatest concern in connection with the rearing of these children and the future of our country is the fact that our citizens seem to be developing a thorough lack of respect for our laws and institutions , and there seems to be a growing feeling that nothing is wrong in life except getting caught . . . . <P> " A large number of people feel . . . that those who have the money to pay for such alcoholic beverages and have them analyzed can drink without risk of health , while those who can not do so must either do without them or take great risks of being poisoned . It is for this reason that the great mass of our workmen and poor people feel that Prohibition does not prohibit , but is a scheme to deny them something . . . . Is it any wonder they should rebel ? . . . "
