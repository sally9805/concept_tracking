The city of Wanhsien , some 1,200 miles up the Yangtze river from Shanghai , became suddenly last week of world importance as Chinese mercenaries battled there with two tiny British river warships . <P> Yang . One General Yang Sen , a little sloe-eyed commander , 45 , nominally subordinate to Super-Tuchun Wu Pei-fu ( see above ) , caused the affray by seizing the British river freight boats Wan-tung and Wanhsien . General Yang alleged that the Wanliu , another British freighter owned by the same company as those seized had previously upset two sampans filled with his soldiers . Despite the protests of the local British consul General Yang placed 300 soldiers on the captured freighters who promptly locked the white officers and passengers in their cabins , fed them but sparingly . <P> Deadlock . Meanwhile the British auxiliary warship Kiawo , a mere , armored river steamer , lay beside the captured vessels , covered at point blank range by the Yang artillery . To break this deadlock , intolerable to British amour propre , H. M. S. Cockchafer and H. M. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamed close to shore , drew the fire of the land batteries and shelled the city of Wanhsien . <P> Battle . The British auxiliary Kiawo at once opened fire on the land batteries , and all three British warships steamed close to the captured British merchantmen , in an effort to rescue their officers and passengers . The Kiawo steamed under the lea of the Wanhsien and effected a rescue of all Occidentals on board after a hand to hand fight with the Chinese . General Yang 's well directed artillery fire made it impossible to board the Wantung , but the British warships stood by at a distance and picked up the Wantung 's crew and passengers who leaped overboard and all swam to safety despite the pot-shotting of Chinese riflemen . The British ships then withdrew out of range of the shore artillery and bombarded Wanhsien , a city of 150,000 population , until fires broke out in every quarter and completed the destruction . Three British officers and four British seamen were killed . <P> Demonstration . At once Vice-Admiral Sir Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair , commander-in-chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yangtze on his flagship , the cruiser Hawkins . Sir Edwyn well knew that the potent Hawkins could not navigate the Yangtze above Hankow , some 300 miles below Wanhsien , on account of the shallow rapids , most famed of which is the so-called " Tiger 's Tooth . " But Hankow could be used as a base for punitive expeditions , and a glimpse of the Hawkins might strike salutary terror into many a Chinese breast .
