IF the crops are not too pushing , the farmers usually end their week 's work at Saturday noon . After dinner you will find them congregated in the neighboring village , buying rations , swapping news , politics , and sometimes religion until evening comes . The boys have gathered over at the old-field baseball diamond where with run and shout and a little cussing they play their hearts out till darkness drives them home , perished for water and with the seat of their trousers dragging the ground . And if times are not too hard the old man will return with ice and vanilla flavoring to make cream for the children . And everybody will have some fun between the heat of the fields behind and the loneliness of Sunday coming on . Thus it is on a particular Saturday night in summer at the home of JOHN DAY , a hardworking tenant farmer . Two or three men are sitting in the bare moonlit yard before the house , talking about their crops , and hopes for the future . And since the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as daily bread , they now and then vouchsafe a word concerning God and the nature of the universe . It is about nine o'clock at evening and the moon is high in the sky . Stretching around the house and away , the fields of cotton and corn cast up a silvery radiance in the air . Behind the old barn over there a whippoorwill is cutting a rust . A young woman opens a door and comes out on the low vine-clad porch . The glow from a lamp inside pours out after her , revealing morning-glories climbing the posts and varicolored flowers set in tin cans along a shelf to the left . Through the door and across the room beyond a little porch is seen at the back of the house where a water-shelf is built and where a tall , motherly woman is dishing up ice-cream for a swarm of children . The young woman returns into the house  --  evidently the expected one has not come  --  and closes the door behind her to keep the bugs and gnats from streaming in . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their talk , with gaps of silence between their speeches . LUCAS Turning a gleaming fiddle in his hand . Nice and cool out here . p. 3 DAY Purty cool and nice . LUCAS The cream was good . DAY It was that . LUCAS Corn out there  --  growing fast  --  hear its j'ints pop . DAY Purty good . That whippoorwill 's a mess , ai n't he ? White bowl o ' milk !

Just sounds like it . DAY Funny . LUCAS You 're a strong man , John Day , and I 'm a weak one . I 'm thinking of it . DAY Teasing . What is it , judge ? LUCAS You got crops and children . Whistling . And I got a fiddle . Suddenly animated . Like that bird , maybe , with no home but his song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco  --  try it , Mack . LUCAS Yes . DAY What ails that boy ? Calling . You Joshua  --  hurry up with your cream and bring your banjo out ! p. 4 JONES Looming up in the darkness . Booh ! He is a jolly man and given to tricks . DAY For goodness sakes ! Light and cool your saddle . JONES Started the music yit , Mack ? Could n't miss that . DAY Waiting for Joshua to git his bait o ' that cream . The door opens again and the young woman comes out on the porch . JONES Heigho , Polly . POLLY Disappointed . Good evening . DAY Go in and git you some cream , Allen . JONES Spitting loudly over his shoulder . Lord , I et a supper would kill a bull . Eddie brought some croakers back from Duke . LUCAS draws his bow across his fiddle in a few plaintive notes . DAY Well , have some tobacco . JONES Just put in a chew . Sitting down quickly and heavily . How 's the world with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAY And you ? p. 5 JONES Moonlight and sunshine , boys . DAY Rain ? JONES When needed . Laughing . Not moonshine . He ai n't come , has he ? Nodding towards POLLY . DAY At home trying to find his collar-button maybe . Slow  --  but stiddy . LUCAS Playing almost inaudibly and murmuring . I been a-courting , mother.Make my bed soon for I must lie down . JONES Reckon he and Polly 'll ever come to a ' understanding ? DAY I du n no . Ef they do n't somebody 'll die single . JONES If he ai n't been hyuh every Sa'd'y and Sunday night for the last three years , I 'm a bull calf . DAY Shouting . Joshua ! Call him , Polly . The young woman goes into the house . LUCAS Sixty year is a long time to live ! JONES Uh-uh now , always thinking of something . DAY Long , and not so long . JONES Long one way , not so long another . p. 6 LUCAS Flirting out the bar of a jig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just forty-one and ai n't never been sick . DAY Young . And Mack and me is old . Reaching over and touching LUCAS on the shoulder . We 've been through a lot . LUCAS More'n we 'll have to again . DAY That 's right . Jocularly . Well , there 's some pleasure in knowing that , even . How many miles you reckon you 've ploughed in your life , Allen ? JONES Maybe a thousand or two , I do n't know . DAY Polly and Joshua got to figgering the other day  --  they 're always at some mess  --  to see how far I 'd walked behind the plough in my life . Lemme see . I had walked a ' average of twenty miles on a ploughing day , and I averaged about sixty-five ploughing days to the year , and this summer I 've been at it fifty years . Addressing the young woman who has returned . How many miles did you say I 'd walked behind the plough ? POLLY Over sixty-five thousand . JONES My Lord ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitedly . That 's just behind the plough , folkses . More than twice around the world , ai n't it ; Polly ? p. 7 POLLY Yes . DAY Poking LUCAS in the ribs . She believes the earth 's round . LUCAS It 's square , and flat , like a table , anh ? JONES The Bible speaks of the four corners . POLLY What about them that 's been around it ? JONES Almost whispering . Edgycation . DAY Powerful . LUCAS Looking up at the moon . I was putting up fenceposts for the Squair yistiddy , and I dug up a rock . Musing . I thought to myself it had been there forever and ever . DAY God put it there . JONES Taking off his hat and spitting reverently . He shore did . God made it and put it there . LUCAS I du n no so much about that . JONES Even more reverently , with a touch of eagerness and awe . We 've hearn it said you 're ' bout a plumb inhf-idel . LUCAS I 've wondered about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mack . LUCAS From the beginning ? JONES Forever and ever . LUCAS Again drawing the bow across the strings . How long is that ? JONES All of time  --  ca n't be ' magined , except God does it . DAY Reverently . He holds time in the hollow of His hands . LUCAS Softly . He 's got hands ? JONES As if quoting . Lifted up with His hands . Suddenly confused .

LUCAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd done all my walking on a path going there .

On the porch POLLY begins whistling to herself . JONES Gitting lonesome ? POLLY There 's some good vanilla ice-cream , Joe . HARWELL Feeling his high collar . Believe I 'll go help Josh clean out the can . He starts into the house but gets no further than the porch . JONES In a sudden , loud voice , as if reciting . And after all them millions of miles walking , what have you got ? Have you got a house ? No . It belongs to the Squair . Have you got a horse ? No . A mule ? A buggy ? No . All belongs to the Squair . Quietly . I 'm just talking like business , you know . Got little enough myself . DAY I ai n't made much  --  so . JONES And you got your children . But we all got them . DAY And you got your experience . LUCAS And we all got that . p. 11 DAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enconced . A hardworking man for you , Mack . LUCAS says nothing . Strong as a bull . Work , work , work .

Plenty o ' people cut up in their religion . JONES Now spitting loudly again . Yes they do . DAY Aye , but we got to have it . JONES ' Member that preacher at Angiers ? Tried to walk on water . He had planks hid under it to walk on . Slapping his thigh with his hat in glee . And then one day the boys found it out and moved the plank . He rears back and roars with laughter . LUCAS Bouncing across the strings . And old Joel Tart announced to the world he 'd been give the gift of reading from above . And a great crowd come a-Sunday to hear him do it . Later on they found he 'd got it by heart from a preacher . Now John , that was a come-off . DAY And Joel 's sister Nannie was said to 've spoke real Chinaman 's talk in the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the spirit in her tongue . JOSHUA comes out on the porch with a lamp in one hand and a banjo in the other . He is a stout , husky lad of eighteen or twenty . He sets the lamp down on the porch , and in the light the faces of the others are visible. p. 13 JOSHUA Lord , what a supper I 've et . He comes out into the yard and sits down , tuning his banjo . The rather sheepish JOE , now that he and his vivacious sweetheart are visible in the light , slides his chair away from her . JOSHUA What is it , Mr. Mack ? Smothering a grin in his blouse . Hee-hee ! LUCAS His mournful , haggard face lighted with a smile . Something short ' n easy . Anything  --  The Drunken Soldier . Rosining up and shooting his bow across the strings in a preparatory whorl of sound . They like that piece up in Wake County . JOSHUA Begging on bended knee . Lead her out'n the stall . He whangs out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JONES rolls his tobacco back in his jaw and clasps his hands in rhythm . DAY Nodding at JOSHUA . Cai n't he play it ? JONES Looking up at the moon and braying . Oh the night 's a little dark , And the roads a little muddy , And I cai n't ride straight , And I cai n't ride study  --  p. 14 DAY Calling . How 's that , Joe ? HARWELL Stealing a look at POLLY . Right fine . LUCAS and JOSHUA wind up with a flourish . Several little children , dressed in their night-drawers and gowns , come to the door of the porch and peep out . CHILDREN Pa , we want to hear it . MRS . DAY Coming out and leading them in . Well , hear it in bed then . JONES I 'll declare ! CHILDREN In the house . We want to hear ' em play ! LUCAS and JOSHUA impatiently amble up and down the necks of their instruments . LUCAS I always liked the Mountain Dew piece . JOSHUA Crowding close to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if piqued at the interruption of her lovemaking , leaves her chair and sits down on the edge of the porch . JOE looks pleadingly at her and then stares heavily at the floor . Without more ado , the two musicians are off with The Mountain Dew . As they play , JONES falls in with his patting and old DAY leans back in his chair , a smile softening his rugged , weather-stained face . At first JOE pays little attention to the music , then presently he is seen beating the floor softly in time with his feet . POLLY ever and anon steals a glance at him. p. 15 JONES Lord , it brings a heap o ' things back to me . The music stops and LUCAS leans over to his partner . JOSHUA Casting up his eyes joyously . That 's it too . Announcing to those around him , running a medley of chords the while . The Arkansaw Traveller , folkses . MRS . DAY comes out and sits down on the steps , dipping snuff and placidly spitting in the yard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Arkansaw . As the monologue goes on , JOSHUA 'S whang-whang serves as a background for the presentation of a traveller and farmer in conversation . " Hullo , stranger . " " Hullo , yourself . If you want to go to hell , then go there yourself . " " Play the other part of that tune . " " There ai n't no other part . " " Why do n't you cover your house ? " " Ca n't cover it when it 's raining . In dry weather , it do n't leak a drap . " " What makes yore corn look so yaller ? " " Fool , I planted the yaller kind . " " How did your taters turn out ? " JONES Cracking his palms . Wo n't never sich fools . LUCAS " Did n't turn out , fool , I dug ' em out . " " How fur to where the road forks ? " " Been living here fifty year . It 's never forked yit . " MRS . DAY is heard chuckling softly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , now unconscious of POLLY 'S bright eyes. p. 16 LUCAS " Can I ford the river ? " " Reckon so , the geese can . " " Wisht you 'd head that steer . " " The devil , looks like he 's got a head on him . " " I mean stop him . " " Ai n't got no stopper . " JOSHUA lets out a loud hee-haw , and abandons himself to his banjo . LUCAS " I mean turn him . " " Looks like he 's got the hairy side out . " JOSHUA Worse ' n the old gray mare . Hee-hee ! LUCAS " Lord , Lord , tote 's the rag off ' n the bush . I hired to a man  --  and he sent me to the swamp to split rails  --  teeta-ta-ta  --  told me to choose out the tall trees  --  the straight trees  --  for they would split better  --  and I went and hewed  --  and I sweated and I spewed  --  that night when I got home  --  he asked me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got done o ' the one I was on  --  Tee-ta-ta-ta  --  and two more  --  I 'd have three .  --  Lord God , he fired me  --  fur I 'd been trying to split  --  them old sweet-gums . " LUCAS breaks out in a mournful laugh . JONES He won a gold piece with that at the court-house once . I seen him do it . DAY The years come and go , Mack , but you ai n't lost a bit o ' your power . LUCAS Allen 's pap liked it too . p. 17 MRS . DAY With sudden animation . The last dance I was at Mack played it . JONES Springing up with a whoop . Already ploughed forty miles today , but I feel frush  --  frush ! POLLY Mr. Jones ! JONES Throwing his hat behind him and moving out in an open space . Let her go then . DAY I do n't mind . Cut up . JONES Gim me a reel , real Furginia reel . LUCAS strikes a few notes . Yeh , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were on the dance-floor . Get ready . DAY Blamed if he do n't mean business . JONES Moving over towards the porch . Le 's cake-walk a little . POLLY I could do it some , but  --  JONES Aw , John do n't care . DAY Go to it . JONES Gim me the Paul Jones . LUCAS Who has grown mildly excited . Listen folks , everybody . He plays the opening bars . Formation . p. 18 JONES As LUCAS begins to fiddle . Let the figgers roll . Formation . Longways for six couples , women in one line and men in the other . Hurry up there if you do n't want the sun to find you waiting . All right Polly Day , here I go . Come and jine me while the dew do fall . He begins to dance , bowing and scraping and turning to imaginary ladies around him . As he dances he calls the figures for his own partial execution . LUCAS and JOSHUA pound on the ground , and old DAY leans back and stares at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking in the music . JONES shuffles , bounds , cavorts , all the while squealing out his commands . Forward and back !  --  Swing with your right hand !  --  He stretches out his right hand to POLLY . How 're you tonight , Rosebud ? Purtiest gal from here to the river . Hah !  --  Swing with the left hand ! Hah !  --  How 's that my honeysuckle queen ?  --  Swing with both hands !  --  How 's that ?  --  Allemande . As he turns , he fastens his eyes on POLLY and dances his way over to her . POLLY looks directly at JOE a moment , and then comes out to meet JONES ' outstretched hands . JOSHUA Go to it , Polly , we 'll feed you . Old DAY makes a motion as if to stop her , and then returns to his apparent watching of the heavens . LUCAS ' face seems to grow more and more haggard as the fury of the music increases  --  as if some grief were gnawing within him . It 's a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right hand to partner , and reel . He swings POLLY around and around as if going down the line . Each time she turns she looks at JOE 'S bowed form . JONES pants and blows . Faster ! Let 's get up some feeling here . Shouting . Up the centre . With galop steps he drags POLLY across the yard . JOE looks up , patting his feet , and POLLY looks back as she dances . JONES gasps . March ! He holds POLLY closer to him as the music flies . JOE half rises from his seat , and POLLY 'S eyes beckon him on . Down the centre ! HARWELL Bounding out of his chair . I 'll do it too . He runs up and snatches POLLY loose from him . JONES What !  --  Great guns ! HARWELL His face almost white with fright . I could  --  almost  --  JONES Wiping his streaming brow . Le 's see you dance with her then . POLLY Softly to JOSHUA . Play as fast as you can . JONES Gruffly as he sits down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Le 's see you dance with her , tessie boy . Naw , you ca n't do it . POLLY dances up and down the yard alone . The music goes on . JOE hesitates now after his sudden outburst , makes a movement in , draws back , moves again hesitatingly after her . JONES fans himself with his hat . Look at him ! Le 's see him do something . p. 20 HARWELL Following POLLY . I ca n't dance  --  much  --  none  --  maybe  --  Shyly. but I 'll try , I swear I 'll try it if I hurt . JONES Hah-hah ! Come on now , le 's see you show your raising . MRS . DAY His father was one of the steppingest men there was . JONES Shoe-leather could n't hold him . MRS . DAY I danced through to the blood one night with him . DAY Pshaw , listen at her . As POLLY moves by JOE , he reaches out and timidly seizes her hands , then around the waist . JONES Let the music pour out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go ! POLLY and JOE run up and down the yard , cross , bend and bow in a crude sort of rhythm . They shuffled a jig , they waltz and fox-trot together . Then , as they proceed , they seem to find a common rhythm . Old DAY watches them narrowly and jubilant , significantly nodding now and then to those around him . JOSHUA Hee-hee , Lord , Lord ! JONES Hooray ! Hooray for you , Joe ! Did you ever expect to see it , folkses ! p. 21 DAY Excitedly . I bet him and Polly pulls off something yet . To the woman on the steps . See that , Mellie ? JONES jumps up and stamps his hat in the dirt . JOE and POLLY now whirl along in their new , crude dance . HARWELL His flushed face near hers . Tell ' em to play faster . POLLY You holding me so ! HARWELL Play on , Joshua . Tear up your banjo , I 'll buy you another . Softly to her . All right then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally dropping his banjo . I done played the skin clean off o ' my fingers . LUCAS gradually lets his music die down to a low moaning in the strings . He sits looking out before him as if lost to the scene of which he is a part . JOE suddenly kisses POLLY with a loud smack . JONES He 's done it . Digging his hat out of the dirt . I 'll swear if he ai n't done it . HARWELL Yeh , and I mean it . POLLY stands with downcast eyes . DAY After an embarrassed silence . A fiddle 's some good adder all . p. 22 JONES They went to church a lot but that did n't bring ' em to . HARWELL Softly . Le 's go out walking in the moonshine . POLLY Yes . JONES Singing . Oh , when will the wedding supper be , unh-hunh . MRS . DAY Allen , do n't start that right off . DAY Tomorrow if you say so . Go up to the Squair 's with the license  --  HARWELL Manfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shyly at his arm and they go out of the yard and down the road . POLLY Timidly . We 're going for a walk , just a piece . MRS . DAY Come back in a little bit . She bows her head , and for no reason at all falls to weeping silently in her apron . JONES You 'll have a fine son-in-law , and he 'll own land . LUCAS Still fiddling softly . I walked through the trees , and I walked through the hills , And I ask you to tell me if you can , You know what a rock is , you know what a tree is , But what is the soul of man ? p. 23 JOSHUA Repeating in a bass voice . And I ask you tell me if you can  --  Quiet comes over them and for a long while there is nothing to be said . DAY Trying to say something . The young will go on and the old will go on . LUCAS It was made to be so . JONES Great guns , right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bad weather . JONES Looking out towards the moon . Yeh , rain . DAY A star close to its edge and a ring-around . JOSHUA Look at them little white clouds . Cold like snow . JONES Lonesome looking up there . The moonlight bathes their lifted faces with its pale shine . DAY Like a wide field . I 've seen ' em so in March . JOSHUA A long ways there and back . LUCAS You know what the moon and the stars may be , And the width of the salt sea land , But where is the man can answer me , What is the soul of man ? p. 24 JONES Sighing . Uh-uh . After a moment . On a white night like this , every stump looks like an old man with a beard . I 'm ' bout a-skeared to go home , hah , hah . JOSHUA That was a come-off . Right in the open ! DAY On a night like this I rid a mule once to see Mellie there , and he got skeered of a stump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , same as folks , a-laughing at me . I reached me a rail and laid down by a bush and when he come by I whammed him in the burr of the ear and piled him  --  Toreckly he got up He goes on telling the story . We hear him no more , leaving the four moonlit faces and the bowed figure on the step . Somewhere the lovers are abroad , laying their plans for the long , fat winter coming on.
