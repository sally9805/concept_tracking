txt Street Cars and Buses . I am glad that you printed the letter which Georgia M. Penfield wrote you regarding " Street Cars and Buses . " and which appeared on the editorial page today . Every word of it is true . It is really practically a waste of time to wait for a bus in the Thirties around 5:30 , as they atop only when compelled to do so by the traffic signals . Were an attempt made to operate enough buses of the Fifth Avenue type on Broadway to carry all the people who now use the surface ears there , the result would be , I am sure , worse traffic conditions than now exist , not to mention the increased cost to the city of keeping the pavement in repair . How much more comfortable it is to ride in the car than the bus , what with the odor of gasoline , the jarring starts and stops , and the constant brushing past the person on the outside half of the seat by the conductor . Of course , he isn't- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow , and one 's neighbor is equally blameless , the seat Is really not wide enough for two average persons . I would also add a word in commendation of the sevelal articles which you printed some time ago regarding the substitution of buses for surface cars In Westchester . Especially did your remarks regarding the comparative cost of operation set one to thinking , in connection with one central power plant , as in the case of the cars , and a separate one for each vehicle . In the case of the bus . And , would a bus be in operation after ten years  --  which is at least the age of the average street car ? HENRY G. KELLER .
