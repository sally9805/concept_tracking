The death on March 24 of Senator Samuel D. Nicholson of Colorado deprives the Republicans of another vote in the next Senate . In the new Congress the Republicans had , until the death of Senator Nicholson , 53 Senators ; the Democrats , 42 ; and the Fanner-Laborites , 1 . Governor Sweet of Colorado , who must appoint a successor to Senator Nicholson , is a Democrat sponsored by the Nonpartisan League . Senators Ladd , Frazier , Shipstead , Wheeler , Howell , Brookhart and La Follette were also sponsored by the League . Consequently it is expected that a radical Democrat will be appointed to the vacancy caused by Senator Nicholson 's death . The resulting alignment will be : Republicans 52 Democrats 43 Farmer-Labor 1 But if-as seems probable-the Progressive or Insurgent group of Republicans , numbering five or ten , and Senator Shipstead , the Farmer- Laborite , vote with the Democrats on many questions , the alignment will be : ' <P> Republicans 42-47 <P> Democrats , etc 49-54 <P> The Democrats will have a majority . Control of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new state of affairs is likely to be felt as soon as the 68th Congress assembles . The chairmanship of the Finance Committee is left vacant by the retirement of Senator McCumber . This committee handles tariff " and other financial measures ; so control of it is very desirable to the La Follette bloc . Senator Smoot , who is classed as a reactionary , would , according to seniority precedent , naturally become chairman . But next to Smoot in seniority is La Follette himself . It is entirely probable that the Progressives , using the fact that they control the balance of power , may attempt to elect their leader to the post .
