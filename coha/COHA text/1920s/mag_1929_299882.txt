ARMY &; NAVY <P> AIRDROME RAIDED-FOURTEEN ENEMY PLANES DESTROYED COLUMBUS R. R. YARD WRECKED CINCINNATI WIPED OUT RAID REPULSED-FOUR BOMBERS DOWN-CREWS KILLED-OUR LOSSES SLIGHT <P> Such would have been newspaper headlines last week if the Army 's air war game over Ohio had been real instead of mimic . <P> As it was , 200 planes , divided between Reds and Blues , attacked , repulsed , dipped and dived over imaginary battlefields on which moved some 800,000 troops , seen only by the umpires . <P> Most spectacular of the air maneuvers was the Blue raid on the Red army supply base at Columbus . Fifteen giant bombing planes screened by 15 pursuit craft and preceded by 18 attack planes executed this theoretical destruction . In a 100-second diving assault the attack planes delivered an effective fire equal to an infantry division of 30,000 men supported by divisional artillery . The Red defense , surprised , was unable to down a single bomber . Later in the day , a combined Blue and Red air force thrice circled Cincinnati , theoretically dropped hundreds of bombs , wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keystone twin-motored bomber from Ohio to " destroy " lower Manhattan at night . <P> The plane will refuel twice en route without landing . <P> But not all the havoc was on paper . Real tragedy swept the clouds when two planes , flying in close formation in the simulated air raid on Columbus , collided at 10,000 ft . Lieut . Edward L. Meadow was chewed to bits by the propeller of a plane piloted by Lieut . A. Fred Solter . Lieut . Solter , parachuting for his life , was carried to a hospital .
