txt There seems to be considerable difference of opinion among those supposed to be inforMed on the railway situation as to what effect the segregation of the Central Pacific road from the Southern Pacific will have on the earnings of the tatter . I own 160 shares of Southern Pacific , bought at from 89% to 90%. and wish to know if , in your opinion , there are any prospects of Southern Pacific stock advancing ? Do you consider the 6% dividend as being safe , without the earnings of the Central Pacific ? Would you recommend disposing of my holdings at a price to break even , investing the proceeds in either Great Northern , Northern Pacific and Santa Fe stock , or Erie general lien 4% bonds , ' maturing in 1996 , at around their present level of ** H. J. SOUTHERN rAcuric-PENxigaiLl ' A I A ? N. V. CENTRAL . 24849 ? We notice the Southern Pacific , paying 6 ' ; dividend , is selling a very little above Pennsylvania , paying 4% , and about in lime with New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Southern pacifie. with its long dividend record should sell very much higher than either of the above stocks . Will you kindly give us your views ? Answer  --  Southern Pacific 's recent earnings , except those for the month of May , have not been such as to move the stock contrary to general market tendencies . May statement showed a decided improvement over a year ago , and we would expect the improvement generally to continue . Loss of the road 's traffic to water routes has been substantial , but while continuing will presumably not get much , if any , worse . Traffic not exposed ter water competition may be expected to increase with the revival of business and development of the road 's territory . Arrears of maintenance left over from federad control have had to be made up and that is now fairly well accomplished . No one can say in advance what the effect of a severance of Central Pacific from Southern Pacific ownership would be , because too much depends upon what price they get for it and what trackage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Supreme Court decision directed that Southern Pacific he allowed continued access to certain points , including San Francisco hay . It should be noted that the court has given southern Pacific leave to move for a rehearing and it is possible that the whole question will be reopened with reference to legislation by Congress since the passage of the Sherman law and even since the beginning of this suit ; namely . the Transportation Act of 1920 . We would not recommend changing Southern Pacific into Great Northern or Northern Pacific or Erie bonds . A switch into Atchison would he rather expensive at this time , although it is not unlikely that Atchison may increase its dividend rate within the next six to twelve months and is more likely to make an increase than Southern Pacific is , hence the difference in price . Pennsylvania and New York Central are selling at their present prices in view of the probability that their dividend rates will he increased by the end of the year or before . assuming that present mine and railroad labor troubles are Euijusted without long delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record is not as long as that of either New York Central or Pennsylvania .
