Using a selenium cell , which is photo-electric ( i.e. , when sensitized by light rays , it gives off an electric current ) , French engineers of the military wireless service , General Gustave Ferie , M. Jouaust and Major Mesny , amplified waves from Capella , the blue star of the first magnitude in the constellation Auriga , into audible sound waves . The transformation was effected by a bulb of four electrodes , with much higher potential than the audion bulbs commonly used in wireless . The star is 71 light years ( over 400 trillion miles ) from the earth . The sounds were audible over a telephone to a considerable distance . The report was presented to the French Academy of Science . <P> The inventors are continuing their experiments in the hope of perfecting some practical application of radio communication with other planets . The principle is not new , for Alexander Graham Bell talked along a beam of light in 1882 , and the similar nature of sound and light has long been an established fact .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
