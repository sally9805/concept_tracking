txt What the market will do over the next few weeks is anyone 's guess . So far bulls have bad a little the best of it , although in professional trading circles bears outnumber bulls three to one . Traders working for a decline have been well supplied with ammunition : in advancing discount rates , new high for brokers ' loans and talk of higher money . Constructive traders have used improving business as a counter argument . The bear element has lost money because it went short of certain active stocks that advanced sharply . On the other hand losses have been taken on the bull side through selecting stocks that went down . It has been nip and tuck in some issues . The public has been a buyer of stocks , and this is one reason for the failure of the market to run into a bad break . if brokers ' loans are indicators of conditions , there has been no liquidation to speak of . Heavy selling on balance would be reflected in a sharp decrease in brokers ' borrowings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Failure of the market to decline on advancing discount rates reflects a strong financial condition . Corporations have more cash than ever and inventories are normal or below normal . Banks have plenty of money available for lending purposes and individuals have an abundance of money available for investment . Stocks not bought outright are carried on wider margins than ever . One reason the market has not declined much is there is no deflation anywhere . Brokers ' loans are large , but they reflect merely the record-breaking increase in listings on the Exchange and transactions in stocks averaging between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 shares daily . RATHER TWO-SIDED One trader argues it . is a hull market , although there are some stocks that should be avoided as they are likely to sell lower . Another trader argues it is a bear market , although some stocks should be avoided as they are likely to sell , higher .

On the floor of the Stock Exchange they say a fierce contest is being waged between certain groups of hulls and bears in International Nickel and Radio . So far neither side seems to have had any advantage . A VIEWPOINT ON GOOD STOC KS " What 's the use of selling good stocks as long as investors are subscribing for new issues being offered at the rate of more than $5.1.00.000,000 annually , " remarked one veteran trader . " Look at the yield on some of the new securities offered and then note the yield of some seasoned gilt edged stocks , particularly railroad issues that are traded it ! on the New York Stock Exchange . Whenever you find a good demand for gilt edged new issues offered to the public you always will find a good demand for seasoned gilt edged issues on the Exchange . I ant talking from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clucas &; Co. has published an analysis of the Chrysler Corp . concluding as follows : " The rapid accumulation of holdings and liberal charges against earnings for reserve accounts , indicate that either the corporation contemplates retirement of its funded debt and preferred stock ( which . as is pointed out , it is in a position to do any time ) , or it seems likely that even the conservative management of this corporation will decide to be more liberal with common stockholders and will increase the dividend rate . " PRO AND CON Bear ? " Loans up to new high . The market e ill go down on that . " Bull ? " You may he right , but my theory is that when loans start to show shrinkages it will be time enough to sell . As long as they increase a little or hold around the present level we are sure of one thing  --  people arc not liquidating . And you know as well as I that it take , : real liquidation to bring on a bear market .

These factories were largely experimental and it was found that cheese of fairly good quality could be made in these sections . However it seems that the supremacy of the Wisconsin dairy country in volume and quality of its cheese is not to be challenged , at least for some years to come , nothwithstanding the prospects for increased production and improvement in quality of the product in other parts of the country . " FERTILIZER S'T'OCKS It looks as though the fertilizer stocks had turned the corner . Companies that sell material to American Agricultural , Virginia Carolina Chemical and other companies in that class report tales are running from 25 ' ; to 50% in excess of a year ago . THE LUMBER . BUST N USK Reports to the National Lumber Manufacturers Association from 414 mills indicate a 20% increase in orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a little behind last year in point of new business , though production and shipments are running even with last year . The West Cc sat Lumberman 's Association reports shipments are 5% above production , while the Southern Pine Association reports shipments 0.39% below product:on , with orders running 4.37% behind shipments . THE KILL VAN HULL BRIDGE The Port of New York Authority has decided to span the Kill Van Kull between Bayonne and Port Richmond with a $16,000,000 arch . This is preferable to the suspension type for aesthetic , financial and mechanical reasons . The low banks and presence of solid rock close to the surface render the arch type advisable . This incidentally , will be the longest arch in the world . STEEL Based on the successive increases in unfilled steel tonnage over the past several months it looks ? is though U. S.

A market without a trend is the hardest kind of a market to beat . Some believed the market would decline on the eve of the double holiday , but it did n't . Most stocks were firm but changes , with few exceptions , were confined to fractions . A constructive feature was the strength of the railroad shares . Packing stocks were also active and strong , and so were some of the coppers . Gold Dust was the strong feature of the industrials , making a new high above 100-
