Irishfolk applauded Charles A. A. Bennett , Yale faculty wit and philosopher , last week , when he said in Dublin , Ireland : " The British humorous weekly Punch presents distorted , snobbish , and inaccurate pictures of American life and manners in its cartoons . . . . Wars tend to be provoked by such fostering of ignorant prejudices . . . . Much of the American slang distorted by Punch is vigorous and expressive instead of vulgar . "
