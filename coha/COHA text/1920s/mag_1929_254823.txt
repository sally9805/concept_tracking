On tour through English factory towns is an august , frock-coated , slant-eyed Trade Delegation from the rich Chinese province of Manchuria . Last week while visiting the extensive Longbridge Works at Birmingham , where Sir Herbert Austin turns out his trig , seven h. p . " Baby Austins " in thousands , Chairman T. Y. Wang of the Delegation said : <P> " Our great arsenal in Mukden is going to be transformed into an automobile factory , by far the largest in the East . We shall make ' Chinese Dragon ' cars and also ' Baby Dragons . ' I see no reason why one day China may not export these cars to Europe and America . " <P> All very well are such confident , prophetic words , but at present the Mukden Arsenal is working overtime to produce enough artillery , rifles and ammunition for the latest Chinese civil war . So perfect and efficient are copies of the famed French " 75 " field gun now made in Mukden , that if ever the arsenal is set to copying motor cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from an " Austin Seven . " Similarly , tractors are made in Soviet Russia so exactly like those produced by Henry Ford- even to the name plate - that simple peasants to whom they are sold never know the difference .
