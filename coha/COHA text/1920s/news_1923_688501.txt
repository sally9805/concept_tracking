txt Well , the new year is getting d broken Into its job , and we are beginning to undo our resolutions . How many men were heartaned to swear off smoking by the example of Jamie Joe Cannon , quitting after sixty-three years ! And how many said on Wednesday noining , " Oh , well , if Uncle Joe could n't stick it out more than two days , why Mould I ? " A. good many people will panupsabize with ate citizen of Berlin who shot himself on the stroke of midnight , of Dec. 31 , with : he remark that he refused to have anything : o do with 1923 . Not that there is anything In particular wrong with this new year , ex:tePt that it Is depressingly like all other years . Still , one notes a few signs of improvement here and there . Berlin seems to have been ashamed of its New Year 's Eve record of suicide , homicide and alcoholic poisonings. and wonders apprehensively what foreigners will think . Berlin has n't heard the returns from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , too , - tias made a flying start by firing Mr. Victor Margueritte out of the Legion of Honor into the subnormal minority of French citizens who do n't wear the ribbon , because he wrote a naughty book . Recruiting for the Legion is going to be hard if they make honor a qualification for membership . It seems to have been felt that the Legion would suffer if the public got the idea that its honor rooted in dishonor Stood , and that dishonorable books could be written under its protection . But , notoriously , most artists are stimulated by their surroundings to write something in violent contrast . Theocritus invented pastoral poetry in the biggest city of his age ; few men . babble of green fields when they have to work in them . " Main Street , " the piece de resistance of modern realism , was written in Forest Hills , Long Island , the only town on earth where taco-Gothic romanticism , still flourishes in its purest 1830 style .

Mrs. Mary Willman laid out . ? Governor Smith 's message contains several stimulating moral observations . " As all crimes are predicated upon sins , " ? he observes . " no persons should be held guilty of sin under the law until they can be convicted of a crime . " But how are you going to convict anybody of a crime , in this town at least , when the.entire police force is detailed to marchings and countermarcbings among cafe tables , or immobilized on peg post in front of raided premises ? This will go down in history as the . first Winter in which not a man on date force got his feet wet . Miss Clemence ' Dane has written a. play about William Shakespeare which has enchanted our local highbrows ; though , if they report it correctly , it is about as much like Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , smells of Creme ' Yvette . " ' What task more difficult , " chants Mr. Percy Hammond , " than that undertaken by Miss Dane when she endeavors to show the Swan in the act of making love ? In his dramas he has equipped many birdlike swains with deathless words of passion ; but here . more than anywhere else , ? he must sing . " So he sings , apparently to Mr. Hammond 's delight : These are the hands I never held till now : These are the lips I never felt on mine ; This is the hour I dreamed of , many an hour . This is the spirit awake . God in your day ! Did your heart beat so on the seventh dawn ? Maybe that sounds like Shakespeare to Mr : Hammond . To others it does n't ; but , aside from that , one doubts if Shakespeare would have been lyric in his approach to Mary Fitton . More than any other writer in history Shakespeare gives support to the divine afflatus theory of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for an external force . The gentleman who wrote only until he had money enough to go back and knock them cold in his home town , and then quit , was perhaps not so very poetical , outside of office hours . When Shakespeare was really and frantically in love , he probably approached the radiant Mary with stammering monosyllables and tried to get over most of the ground by suiting the action to the word . And if later she rallied him on his inarticulate lovemaking . he probably told her he saved up all his good lines to put in his plays . After all , the only authentic expression of Shakespeare about his lady-loves that has come down to us is that mean line about the second-best bed . William Hohenzollern is still rewriting history . to judge from a German-American writer 's story of his week at Doom which is running in the Milnische Zeitung . The Kaiser explains that the derivation of the name Hohenzollern from " Zoll "  --  a delicate allusion to the fact that early members of the family were genteel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hohenzollerns , he says . were related to the Hohenstaufen ; and the Hohenstaufen were the quality folks in those days . Well , each to his , taste . Napoleon tore up a genealogy which traced his ancestry back to Charlemagne , observing that his line began at Montenotte . Vespasian remarked that he was his own ancestor . But William Hohenzollern is going to be remembered princiPally as a descendant . " My model as a. historian , " says William . " is Thucydides . " Vorwarts. the Berlin Socialist paper , discovers that in Hessian schools there is in use a textbook , published after the war ended , which apparently ignores the events of 1918 altogether . For one of its chief ornaments is a poem about the Kaiser whose final stanza runs as follows : " A. storm has destroyed those who wished ? to annihilate us . The enemy made an awful mistake ; for the German Kaiser stands on guard with his seven sons . " " Stands on guard ! " says Vorwh.rts indignantly .

More explicit than the others is Witter Bynner , who writes thus of his friend Carl Sandburg : We see his shadow and mistake it for a haymow Or a ton of brick : WO feel his breath and believe it soft coal or a breath from the stockyards Or from a watering cart ; We hear , in his teeth , an automobile horn . .
