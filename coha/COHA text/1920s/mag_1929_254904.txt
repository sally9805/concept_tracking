So my father and I have proposed to undertake such a task . Get in touch with us . . . . P.S. We are individual , just father and son . We also will clean up the hogs in six weeks . My father is social , but when wild hogs go fooling around him he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His motto is ' Be Prepared . ' I hope we can clean up the hogs for the Turks . "
