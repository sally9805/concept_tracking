" As sure as God lives and the sun rises in the morning there will be a soldier bonus law passed by the next Congress . Instead of talking about reducing taxes , the real problem is how to raise the funds for the bonus ! " - Senator Smoot of Utah . <P> As regards a bonus , Senator Smoot 's declaration is an interesting prediction-and one that is not unlikely to be fulfilled , because of the large increase of " insurgent " members in the next Congress . As regards taxes , the Senator 's words are more than a prediction-they are an announcement . Senator Smoot , according to seniority rules , will be next Chairman of the Finance Committee and so-called " watch dog of the Treasury . " In that position he will have an important voice in deciding the tax program for next year . <P> Secretary of the Treasury Mellon suggested several weeks ago that taxes be reduced . His reasons were that the income tax and the tariff are producing much greater revenue than was expected . Now Senator Smoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable reasons : He considers the bonus likely to pass . This will call for much additional revenue . If any tax tinkering is undertaken , the LaFollette group will use every means to amend the bill by adding excess profits taxes , and larger income surtaxes . This result Senator Smoot and the regular Republicans are anxious to avoid . To meet the bonus , if it comes , regular Republicans will want every cent that is now being raised-they will want more , in fact , and even talk of using the British Debt payments for the purpose . But at all costs they want to avoid tinkering with the tax laws . <P> As for a sales tax to pay the bonus , it revives in whispers from time to time . Senator Smoot , like President Harding , was once for a sales tax to meet the bonus . His present remarks do not indicate that he will advocate it again , but he is evidently in search of new sources of revenue .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
