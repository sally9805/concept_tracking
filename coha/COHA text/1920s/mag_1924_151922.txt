The proviso was fair , but . . . <P> Dr. Fosdick sailed for England . He crowded the greatest Protestant " chapels " of England . He touched the heart of England . His theology was acceptable to England . Dr. Fosdick returned . He was offered several famous American pulpits . He considered whether his preaching of the gospel ought to be contingent upon a theological bargain such as the Presbyterians demanded . He said nothing , but . . . The rumor started , the rumor spread , the rumor became confident prediction that Dr. Fosdick would cease to grace the lower Fifth Avenue Presbyterian pulpit . Probably , it was said , he would undertake , every Sunday , to go from Union Theological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brooklyn , and thus be come successor to Henry Ward Beecher , Lyman Abbott , Newell Dwight Hillis ( TIME , Apr. 21 ) . Said Dr. Fosdick by telegram : " . . . WILL MAKE NO STATEMENT UNTIL OFFICIALLY APPROACHED BY AUTHORIZED COMMITTEE OF NEW YORK PRESBYTERY . "
