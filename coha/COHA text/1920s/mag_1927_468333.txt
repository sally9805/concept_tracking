THERE is a blare of trumpets , and the murmur of more than five thousand people hushes sharply . A baton flickers ? " The Stars and Stripes " flings itself in long red and white streamers of sound . Glances swing abruptly toward a staircase which comes down to the flower-decked platform . A figure descends ? plump , tripping , balancing an armload of roses . " There she is ! That 's her ! " " That 's her ! " The plump one trips forward to center stage , lifts the bouquet , her face wreathed in a garland of interwoven roses and smiles . Upon it plays the calcium ? violet light , pink light , blue light , golden light . And now the vast gathering rises to its feet , breaks into clapping . The plump one bows to this side , to that , a focussed center of roses , smiles , light , delight , applause , while the band fairly bursts its brass to hail her . No . It is not a famous prima donna 's opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedienne or of a queen of the flying trapeze or the tightrope . It is she who outstrips all of these . It is " Sister . " This was my first sight of Aimee Semple McPherson . From it I received the impression , strengthened on many following occasions , that in this unique house of worship called Angelus Temple in the city of Los Angeles the Almighty occupies a secondary position . He plays an important part in the drama , to be sure ; but center stage is taken and held by Mrs. McPherson . It is in her praise that the band blares , that flowers are piled high , that applause splits the air . It is to see her and hear her that throngs travel , crushed in the aisles of electric cars , thrust , elbow , and bruise one another as they shove at the doors of her Temple . Ropes protect the several entrances ; hundreds strain and struggle to be first when these are released . A whistle sounds , the ropes give way , a large detachment of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then up go the ropes again , and a fresh front presses forward , ready to surge in at the next signal . Over the great lower floor and two balconies attendants are hurrying to seat the mob , a full hour before the entrance of the star . Men and women stand against the wall , they sit upon the steps of the aisles , and still , when the final whistle blows , there are thousands turned away , thousands who stand for two , three , four hours on the street and in the nearby park , to listen to the concert and the inspired utterances as they scream themselves forth from the loud speaker outside the building . All the people are making a joyful noise , in very truth ; bringing hither the timbrel and blowing up the trumpet in the new moon ; but the primary object of this mighty demonstration is not that of the Psalmist 's . Rather , it is an ample lady of early middle years , her soft curves concealing muscles like steel ; a lady of flashing eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a lady who , gazing forth with satisfaction upon the assemblage come to do her homage , has the right to honest pride . Sunday after Sunday the same phenomenon is seen . Thousands travel to Angelus Temple , packing the street ears and mobbing the doors , standing with aching feet in the hope of gaining admittance . And this happens not for a brief period of hysteria , it is no nine-days ' wonder ; for several years it has been going on , with ever-growing enthusiasm , and bids fair to continue . Aimee Semple McPherson is staging , month after month and even year after year , the most perennially successful show in the United States . In the weeks that I spent in Los Angeles and observed her with growing wonder , I probably fell far short of learning all her accomplishments . But this much I did grasp : that as a show-producer with unflagging power to draw she knows no equal . She is playwright , producer , director , and star performer in one ; she keeps all her assistants , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their toes ; and , in their midst , she plays her own role with an abandon that sweeps her hearers by hundreds to the altar . Many a revivalist of the past has played upon his audience by the old methods of sensational preaching ; but Mrs. McPherson has methods of her own . Her Sunday evening service is a complete vaudeville program , entirely new each week , brimful of surprises for the eager who are willing to battle in the throng for entrance . In this show-devouring city no entertainment compares in popularity with that of Angelus Temple ; the audience , whether devout or otherwise , concede it the best for the money ( or for no money ) in town . Take a typical Sunday evening . The spectators arrive to find the stage set with an ocean background , rolling green waves flanked by rocks . At one siderises a lofty lighthouse of the kind known technically as " practical . " From time to time its windows flash , its door stands ready to open . An hour of orchestral music , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , ranging themselves in a loft over the speaker 's platform , facing the people and creating the illusion of a heavenly choir just above the inspired one 's head . Their costumes , for this particular evening of nautical entertainment , are in sailor effect , navy and white , jaunty caps atilt . When at length the leading lady enters in the role of rear admiral , she is gallant in a swinging cape over a white uniform , her red-gold coils surmounted by an all-but-official cap . And now , after the round of applause , after the usual greetings and opening hymns and congratulations , after the request that everyone shake hands with four neighbors and say , " The Lord bless you ! " the program begins . It is announced that Christopher Columbus will recite Joaquin Miller 's poem . The lighthouse door opens and America 's discoverer , in full costume of the fifteenth century and with impressive whiskers , emerges . " Look at that , will yuh ! If that ai n't Chris to the life ! " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he rolls forth " Sail on ! " in baritone billows of elocution , while the organ assists . The next performer will be a musician who plays upon a tin whistle and a set of chimes , perhaps a few other instruments . Again the lighthouse door opens , forth he comes , a Gloucester fisherman in full rubber attire to protect him from the nor'easter of tribulation . While Mrs. McPherson informs Radio Land upon the microphone ( which is her constant care ) that , " He 's got just a little tin whistle , folks , just like a little child 'd play on , " the artist chirps forth " Listen to the Mocking Bird , " and in the audience many a horny-handed son of the Iowa farm nudges his neighbor and observes delightedly , " By gum ! I used to whistle that when I was so high ! " " The Mocking Bird " is followed by " The Old Oaken Bucket , " and delight waxes . But the act must be quickly finished . Rarely is the request for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the value of rapid movement , of the quick shift that anticipates boredom . The Gloucester fisherman is hustled off to make way for a sailor boys ' quartette in which there is much business of tugging at the ropes , climbing the mast hand - over - hand , heave-hoing , rocking , and rolling . . . . Next an organ solo , a descriptive piece in which a storm at sea is depicted by creaks , roars , crashes , and groans of the instrument and terrific flashes of electric lightning . There are more songs by sailors and sailoresses , and at length , when the appetite for vaudeville is fairly appeased , comes the headliner , the great act of the evening ? Sister 's message . It is in what she terms " illustrations " that she gives full vent to her showman 's genius . These are her master effort , a novel and highly original use that she makes of properties , lights , stage noises , and mechanical devices to point her message . Heaven and Hell , sinner and saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise and temptations of a bejazzed World are made visual by actors , costumes , and theatrical tricks of any and every sort that may occur to her ingenious mind ? a mind which must work twenty-four hours to the day to pave the way for the lady 's activities . On this particular evening her analogy pertains to the sea . " Look at the little pleasure boat ! " She turns to the background of tossing waves . " Here it comes , sailing along , having a grand time ! " Forth sails the little boat , which represents the gay and reckless one who ignores the warning to repent . It crosses the background of painted waves somewhat jerkily , but entirely to the satisfaction of the rapturous spectators . " Yes , it 's having a grand time , all right . But here comes the pirate ship ? oh , the old pirate 'll get you , little pleasure boat ! I 'm sorry for you , but it 's too late ! " And now the pirate ship , emblem of Satan , hurries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then down goes the victim , crashing , capsizing , while a rejoicing mob applauds ? not the triumph of Evil , but the triumph of Sister the Showman . A ship of commerce follows and goes upon the pasteboard rocks . " You men that do n't think about anything but money , money , ca n't you make some more money ! Oh , you 'll find yourself on the rocks ! " . . . Finally the submarine ; it is compared to those infamous ones who attack Angelus Temple and its high priestess . Her devoted adherents laugh victoriously as the submarine fails in its deadliest efforts at destruction . The sensation of the season was the spectacle called " Life , Death , and Eternity , " which one member of the church described to me as " the grandest show I ever seen . ( ) net when I was in New York I went to the Hippodrome , but it wa n't nothin ' to this . " A huge world , presumably pasteboard , occupied the center of the stage . The actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels in heavenly white , on the other , as sinners in purgatorial black . " Oh , the rich man wants to hold on to his wealth and his fine house ? he holds on mighty tight , do n't he ? " Now , at this stage of the performance I had not been able to get near enough to see exactly what happened , and I was obliged to visualize the tragedy of Dives through the report of a breathless spectator . " Say , the rich man was carryin ' a big toy house to the door o ' Heaven ? what d'yuh know about that ? An ' there was an angel stood there , she had grand wings , an ' she was holdin ' the door open . Well , the rich man he started to step in , but he wanted to take his fine house along , an ' he could n't get it through the door . He tried an ' tried , but it stuck . Say , he had to leave it behind , all right ! " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass into outer darkness , Mrs. McPherson herself enacting the idle lady of wealth who squanders the fleeting hours over the tea-table . Incidentally , she indulged in a few jazz steps across the stage to enforce her point , and performed them with notable facility . So on , to the grand climax . Suddenly out burst a conflagration ? " It was real fire , for sure ! " one of the marvelling reported ? the flames fell rapaciously upon the world , embracing it , destroying . The sinners had left for lower and unseen regions , the world had vanished . And now , slowly descending from the top of the dome , appeared a huge painted scene of the Celestial City , sparkling with lights as it placed itself in the center just above Sister . Never having seen an authentic view of it before in any travelogue , I observed its architecture and streets with deep interest ; the impression gained was that , in its tinted stucco effects and palm-lined boulevards , it strikingly resembles a realtor 's depiction of Los Angeles . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the church 's official news organ ) , " over 5,300 pairs of eyes watched one of the most spectacular illustrations ever presented on this platform . " Sister 's resources are as the widow 's cruse . She is never at a loss for novelty nor does she spare labor or cost . Many a theatrical producer would shrink from the outlay involved in staging such scenes . It is said that the lighting expenditure for one Sunday evening performance would make safe the streets of a dark village . Scene designers and painters are constantly employed . There have been " illustrations " such as a spectacle of brilliant red streamers carried by white-clad Crusaders in a vast interweaving design which must have suggested a ballet figure , the ribbon ends being finally gathered up at a central altar . Harpists were employed to interrupt from timeto time her sermon on " The Song of Songs . " I have been told that a peacock once strutted upon her platform to represent the proud before their fall . The baptism by immersion is perhaps the greatest spectacle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty converts who don white robes and become " dead to sin . " " Oh , what a happy funeral ! " cries the priestess . Curtains part upon an elaborate scene of palms , flowers , and grassy banks , below which the water ripples enticingly . Mrs. McPherson and one of the Brothers , standing waist-deep , immerse one , two , even five at a time ; it is then that the steel muscle within that softly rounded arm displays itself . I have seen her , with only slight assistance , baptize three powerfully built young women with their arms linked , and have marvelled at the physical ease with which she so quickly raised them . . . . A youth like Dempsey rises , shaking his shaggy black mop as a Newfoundland might ? " Praise , praise ! " he cries , and his huge coiling muscles in pink flesh are seen through the wet white shirt as it clings . . . . " This sister is seventy-seven years old , bless her ! " The pinched little white face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Praise Him , hallelujah ! " . . Colored lights incessantly playing . . . . Healing takes place on Saturday evenings , at which service Sister is aided by her associate , Brother Smith Wigglesworth , an English evangelist and author of Worthy Words from Wiggles-worth , or Tidbits for All on the Word of God . Scores hasten ( or limp , or creep , or are carried ) to the altar . Discarded canes , crutches , and wheel-chairs are seen in the foyer . When Sister heals she lays hands upon the afflicted spot and prays . Brother 's method is more athletic : he strips off his coat , advances to the front , squaring as though about to enter the ring . " This woman ( crippled from rheumatism ) has n't knelt down for eight years . When I get through with her she 'll kneel ! " She knelt three times after his manipulations upon her body , so forceful that an assistant had to support her lest she topple over . " I curse you , disease ; I commawnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healing by hands , sometimes by oil , are of many opinions . The majority watch openmouthed and round-eyed . " I 'll say it 's a miracle ! " " Look at Cran'pa throw away his cane , will yuh ! " A grasshopperish oldster is breaking forth in whoops of joy and prancing across the platform , kicking like a member of the Follies , waving his arms , and shouting hallelujahs , while Sister beholds with beaming pride . . . " Aw , they been rehearsin ' him for that act ! " whispers a skeptic behind me . . . One thing is patent : Brother Wigglesworth 's pugilistic manner of handling Satan makes an excellent foil for the tripping and dimpling femininity which led an enraptured follower to sigh , " Sometimes Sister 's such a cutie I think she 'd leave Mary Pickford behind if she 'd give up religion for the screen ! " One of the first questions raised by the observant and non-partisan visitor concerns the audience . Who are they that pack a huge building week after week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was opened , almost five years ago ? Obviously , a great number are those scorned by the priestess as " curiosity seekers . " Thousands of the transient population of the Southwest drift in and out because they " have heard of her . " But there are other thousands who attend faithfully , a large part of them as signed members of this Church of the Foursquare Gospel , which claims , including its branches , to number ten thousand . A uniformed member of the staff told me that it is estimated that two-thirds come into membership through healing . This seems likely in a land that has always been the sick man 's Mecca , whereflourishes every kind of physician , from the orthodox practitioner to the veriest charlatan . The rest drift in , from other denominations or none . A glance about shows that they are largely represented by the Middle West farmer or small-townsman and his family who have come to form so large a proportion of Los Angeles ' population . On every hand are old men and women , seamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard labor with corn and pigs . The men wear what would be their Sunday-best in Iowa . The women are often gaudy in the short , tight , adolescent garb that some salesperson has foisted upon them , and their gray hair is bobbed . The couples drag tired old bones to the Temple and listen as if at the gates of Heaven itself . Often the young people are quite as zealous . One sees earnestness , admiration , even exaltation now and then . One woman , I remember , held my eyes by her beauty , her rapture ; throwing back her head , lifting her hands high , she was singing : " She was not on earth ; she was translated . There came to me a recollection of that tragedy which I believe to have been the greatest American play seen in New York during its season , " The Bride of the Lamb . " But although , after sitting in various parts of the auditorium and talking with many individuals , I was convinced that the majority are more or less ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have met a few intelligent and educated persons who believe thoroughly in Sister 's inspired leadership . Indeed , the conflicting opinions within the organization itself create one of its remarkable features . No doubt , most of the members worship at her feet and regard those enemies who criticize her private life and question her disposition of the funds as Satan 's own host . But there are some who , strangely enough , go so far as to join the church with tongue in cheek . " Yes , I belong , " a certain woman told me . " I work for the poor , too . There 's a lot o ' money spent for charity . But that ai n't accountin ' for all of it . Oh , I ai n't no fool ! " The city is rife with gossip concerning her alleged personal extravagances ; incidentally I may observe that I never felt warmly prompted to rally to the defense of Mrs. McPherson except when told by the scandalized that it is said she buys the most expensive lingerie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why one can not serve the Lord as well in pink silk as in red flannel . But this astounding inconsistency , this mingling of belief and disbelief , I have never seen in any similar following . Apparently , the congregation worship not a prophet of the Lord , but a theatrical idol . For whatever their opinions may be , they revel in the entertainment which Sister provides . They treat the performance , whether a child-wonder 's recitation , a negro 's tune on the piccolo , an opera singer 's solo , or an actor 's delineation , with a sort of admiring familiarity . " Here comes Chris ! " they say at Columbus ' appearance . " My land , ai n't the sinners great ! " they exclaim during the Heaven and Hell ? spectacle . This is similar to the family interest which a stock company wins in time , with a happy anticipation of each week 's novelty . " It 's a good show , anyway ? we always get our money 's worth , " they say . The price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dimes ? make it dollars for the Lord ! " they are urged . Many small coins do , however , rub elbows with large greenbacks . Nevertheless , the sum total must be very large . You may believe Aimee Semple McPherson to be a messenger direct from God Almighty to save His erring world . Or you may believe her to be the most unblushing fraud in the public eye today . Some do one , some the other ; and there is every shade of opinionbetween . But the one fact that stands out is that her influence is incredible , that it carries as that of few evangelists has ever carried , that she is to-day one of the most amazing phenomena of power in this feverish , power-insane United States , and that the curious would like to know how , in popular parlance , the lady puts it over . One of the most remarkable evidences of her hold upon men and women is the fact that she has been able to remain , and to keep on growing , in the same place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. McPherson came to Los Angeles more than a half dozen years ago , I understand , shaking her tambourine in a little tent to a handful of worshippers . It is said that she was a Holy Roller , and traveled in Canada and the United States with this tent which she sewed up with her own bleeding fingers whenever it blew down . To-day she is head of a tremendous organization , and her sermons are heard not only by thousands inside and outside the Temple , but by thousands more who tune in regularly on KFSG . Most remarkable of all is the fact that she accomplishes what she does by means of such vehicles as her own sermons . Every successful preacher of the kind , as fa r as I can recall , has possessed some cleverness and originality in discourse , no matter how crude its expression . A certain coarse humor , sometimes rising to wit , has informed the utterances of the acrobatic Billy Sunday . But let Mrs. McPherson 's deliverances be divorced from Mrs. McPherson 's personality , and they fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of her sermons , and I have before me a packet of seventeen of the most famous , in pamphlet form . To quote at random : " How wonderful are the forces of nature ! How mighty ! " " You and I are gardens , like trees of the planting of the Lord . " " Little butterfly flitting hither and yon ? little humming birds that come humming around to get what honey you can where are you when the storm comes ? " " A mother with trembling hands was stroking back the dampened yellow curls from a marble-white brow . " " A tear trickled down the weather-beaten face and hung like a sparkling jewel in the rough-looking beard . " The ancient phrases , the ancient platitudes . Now and then they are enlivened by slang , as , when the wife of Potiphar was accusing Joseph , " She surely framed him up . " Or , " Will you follow Him ? Oh , men and women , this is brought to a show-down ! " But it is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener ; rather , it carries the impression of being an unconscious lapse into the vernacular . Broadly humorous anecdotes are sometimes brought in , as , for instance , when during her frequent " stunt " of throwing Testaments for individuals in the audience to catch ( a performance more skilful than any I have ever seen outside the circus ) she relates in her curious nasal twang : " One night I was doing this in San Francisco , and there was a lady there who was just a curiosity seeker . She did n't care about the Lord . But one of the Bibles missed the man I meant it for and it hit that lady right in the head . And what do you think she did ? She dropped right down on her knees , and she said , ' Lord , take me ! I never was so hard hit before , and I give up ! I 'm Yours ! ' " But in the main her sermons are without even such diversion ; they are mired hopelessly in a slough of analogy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the type of sentimentalism styled as " sob sister . " " The Scarlet Thread " is " considered to be the most magnificent of all Sister McPherson 's superb sermons " according to its own foreword . It is a mass of commonplaces , melodrama , tawdriness , and cheap emotionalism . Her voice is noticeably damaged by years of strain , breaking in sharp nicks along its edge . Her " r " has the sound of a machine-drill . Hearing thus delivered a sermon utterly commonplace in itself , even to the least fastidious intellect , one marvels more and more at the power of the personality . One grants that there are very wide " varieties of religious experience , " and that different methods appeal to different tastes . Those who would never be even touched by a Handel composition on the organ of King 's at Cambridge , or by a La Farge painting above the altar of the Ascension in New York may be plucked from the gutter and saved by far less subtle means . Furthermore , it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niceties of the tongue have no connection with righteousness . " He would call to Mother and I , " " Let everybody ketch the Temple spirit " may offend the finicky , but will never offend the Lord , we may well be thankful to say . But other preachers with great followings have been possessed of a stimulating freshness of thought ; they have , according to their lights , had something to say and in a novel manner . Aimee McPherson 's power lies not here . Rather , it is the remarkable combination of showman and actress in her gifts which attracts and holds the multitude . As a director she is incomparable . While others are performing , she never for an instant permits interest to flag ; at the first sign of restlessness she steps forward . " All join in with him now ! Sail on If a young singer 's voice proves weak and , therefore , uninspiring , Sister snatches her own tambourine and drives home the rhythm . Let a recitation be dull , she will advance beaming to inquire if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that swift , uncanny perception of hers , the slightest waning of attention ; always , in emergency , she lifts those pink palms , flashes her infectious smile , and breaks into a hymn , catching back her hearers before they discover that they are slipping . This complete control over the mood of her audience she exercises from the instant she arrives upon the platform . Nothing gets away from her , Her grasp , from the first moment , is as tight and as all-inclusive as that of a violinist upon his instrument or a chariot racer upon his reins . Her hands tell the tale of nervous tension ? her hands alone . For the rest she appears completely relaxed . Her chest is full with big breathing , her movements are swingingly free . But watch her hands while others are performing ; they play restlessly , interlacing , touching a lock of hair , adjusting a cuff , collar , wrist-watch . They never relax except as she forces them to do so . She chooses and uses her assistants with the utmost astuteness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist , an advautageous contrast , but a brunette singer enhances Sister 's red-gold charm , while a slip of a timid young elocutionist gives to the leader a poised stateliness . No leading woman of the stage is more carefully supported for effect . In matters such as this her peculiar dual role of the prima donna and that prima donna 's own impresario is displayed . While acting as star , she contrives at the same moment to stand back and present that star . It is as though she were saying , " Here comes Aimee Semple McPherson , the most brilliant performer of the century . Hold your breath , watch her , hear her ! " She dots for herself what a manager is accustomed to do ; she creates an overwhelming " Sister consciousness . " Not only by keeping herself in the newspapers , but by a multitude of other means , she impresses the image . Large banners on the Temple cry , " Welcome to our Sister ! " when she returns from a mission . Her photographs in countless poses appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are sold in the foyer . On a page of the church 's newspaper I counted the number of times that her name occurred : fifteen , to the Almighty 's nine . Every advertiser knows the psychological effect of ceaseless repetition . But no personality can long be impressed unless the personality is in itself remarkable . And Mrs. McPherson 's magnetism is of that inexplicable sort which occurs but rarely in a puzzled world . In appearance she is wholesome , freshly groomed , comely ? no more . But the glance of her companionable eye , the flash of her comprehending smile possess the electrical quality to an all-conquering degree . I confess to having felt it like a warm and overcoming current . My intellect may have sat back disdainfully . But I was relieved when the lady broke her appointment with me ; had I met and talked with her as I intended , I am far from sure that I should have been able to write this article dispassionately . Her gift for taking everyone , from the individual to the vast audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the Almighty as well . She will suddenly run forward , throw up her expressive hands , cry impulsively , " Oh , say , folks , you know I think God is ( her voice catches )  - -  oh , say , I think He 's just simply wonderful , do n't you ? " It swoops them up . Here is the genius of intimacy . By these spontaneous , convincing outbursts she gathers together those five thousand people , draws the Lord down into their midst , holds them all there , together , tight , in a swift melting of emotion which brings men and women crowding to the altar with a weeping outburst of " Hallelujahs ! " Hers may he assumed emotion , but the infectiousness of it is immense . Down she goes on her nimble knees , imploring Heaven . . . sobs are heard on every side . . . I have seen an athletic youth rise shrieking in the audience , pallid , clutching the air and crying upon God ? an able-looking boy who ought to be at some sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " getting the Spirit " by an intoxicant far more dangerous than that taken from him by Vol-stead . " Talking in tongues " usually accompanies these attacks of hysteria , and at times the assistance of sturdy ushers is required to handle the converts . Mrs. McPherson 's creed is clearly defined . Heaven is an " indescribably glorious habitation " where the righteous will be presented at the Throne " without spot or wrinkle " ; and " wherein hosts of attending angels sweep their harps. - Hell is " a place of outer darkness , and there into a lake that burns with fire and brimstone shall be cast the unbelieving , the abominable , the murderers , sorcerers , idolaters , and liars . " It is needless to say in what light she regards Mr. Darwin . One trembles for him . Garden of Eden , serpent and apple are her origin of species , and her pictures of the Hereafter are authoritative . There is no hope of escape from either one or the other of those two dreadful futures ? the lake of brimstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world consists of all-black sinners and all-white saints , and whichever one is he must pay a horrible penalty . Her church does relief work among the poor . A staff of workers daily visits from house to house , carrying food , money , clothing , and " the Word . " There have been cases of outcasts saved , especially from the drug habit . A woman who had worked in this social service said to me , " There 's no question that a lot of money is spent to help the needy . Gossip says that a lot more is never accounted for . The whole organization looks to me like a queer mixture of good and bad . " Sister is not restrained , at any rate , by over-delicacy in the matter of asking for funds . She always calls for " dollars for the Lord , " and she does not blush to take up a second offering after a service , holding the plate herself while greenbacks take on legs and run down the aisles to her .

" Whatever she has won she has worked for ? worked in a ruthless drive , with no pity for her own fatigue . Six days a week she preaches , often more than once a day , hurling her tremendous force into every word she speaks . She utters platitudes in a way that gives them the guise of inspiration . And this is only a fraction of her labor . She organizes and manages a great business enterprise in the Temple . She writes articles , books . She plans and directs the weekly vaudeville with its ever-fresh " illustrations . " She teaches in her Bible School , she marries , baptizes , heals , buries . Breathless with wonder , you ask how one human being ever accomplishes it all . " It 's the Lord working in her , " reply the faithful . " She sure is on the job .

" Here again one catches that glint of steel muscle rippling beneath the soft curves of Aimee McPherson 's fleshly charm . One by one she casts off those who impede her progress of power ; at last she has broken free even from the business partnership in which she and her mother labored in " the great white-heated flame of soul-winning " ; at the height of her prowess she marches forward alone to her goal . It has been stated that her Lighthouse symbol represents a Salvation Navy which she visualizes , world-wide , rivalling the Army and sweeping souls to repentance over the ocean of sin .
