The " opposition " of the U. S. took stock of itself . In failing to win the Presidency , it had lost practically all its power in Congress . Its House minority was 100 seats . In the Senate it was 17 seats behind . It was almost as though the 15 millions who voted for Smith were left without any voice in the doings of the 21 millions who voted for Hoover . <P> One certain Democrat was responsible at once for the hugeness of the Democracy 's popular vote and for the Democracy 's internal division . He was the strongest Democrat . He had demonstrated , apparently , that no living Democrat could have won this year . Now he was leaving politics ( see p. 8 ) , and the question was : to what , if anything , could the Democracy look forward ? <P> Figures . One answer was suggested by statistics . Mark Sullivan , G. O. P. writer , took pains to show that Herbert Hoover had needed only 275,000 more votes , properly distributed , to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State-unanimous election . As easily , the New York World , and Professor Frank G. Dickenson of the University of Illinois , showed that Governor Smith lacked only some 354,000 votes , properly placed-about 1% of the total votes cast-to be elected President with 268 electoral votes . <P> Professor Dickenson explained the " real meaning " of the Hoover " landslide " as follows : " Take ten voters . The first man votes for Hoover , the second man for Smith and so on to the ninth man , who votes for Hoover . The manner in which the tenth man now votes decides the landslide . <P> " That is what happened in the election . Had the tenth man followed the examples of the other even-numbered men he would have voted for Smith . But he did not , so Hoover is our next president . " <P> Factions . At least one voice was raised to urge that Governor Smith take the lead against the Hoover re-election of 1932 . Albert S. Burleson of Texas , Wilsonian Postmaster General , said : " Apparently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Southern people . " But he was drowned out by a chorus of other voices . Bishop James Cannon Jr. , hero of the anti-Smith crusade in Virginia , asked for the resignation of National Chairman Raskob . So did-Georgia 's W. D. ( " Praying Willie " ) Upshaw . So did the Georgian ( Atlanta ) , the Observer ( Charlotte , N. C. ) , the Winston-Salem Journal , the Mobile Register , Senators Simmons and Heflin , Governor Moody of Texas . Roman Catholicism , anti-Prohibition and Tammany were , of course , in all Southerners ' minds . Governor Moody was more polite than most when he centred his fire on Mr. Raskob , whom he called " a cynical commercialist with an alcohol complex . " <P> Mr. Raskob took his flayings in good part but gave no. immediate sign of retiring . Without reference to his own plans he proposed that the Democracy start the groundwork of its 1932 campaign at once . " The most glaring example of our lack of efficiency , " he said , " is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a long period . ... I see no reason why we ca n't function right through the whole four years .
