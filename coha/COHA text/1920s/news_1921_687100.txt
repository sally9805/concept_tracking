txt Although American oil interests whose representatives have recently returned from Mexico with hope for improved future relations are desirous that nothing shall be said in the American press of a character adverse to Mexico , it is nevertheless the plain duty for any section in American journalism that undertakes to keep its readers posted on Mexico to Jet it be known that rosy reports that are given out from Mexico and Mexican Press agencies in the United States can not be confirmed by independent reports from Mexico that reach American centers . People who think that Mexico has reached a condition of peace and stakle government where American rights and property may be considered reasonably safe , may get any day a rude awakening . %VIII ' NO OPEN REVOLIPEION There is no need for open revolution in Mexico . The country is still in revolution against civilization itself and must continue in revolution until there is legislation or judicial determination or decree or treaty giving security to property rights . The present constitution of Mexico is as revolutionary as any Mexican or socialist could desire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Russia has sovietism in operation ; Mexico has sovietism by constitutionfil decree . The courts and the executives in decisions , decrees and edicts declare that the constitution is retroactive and that it is not retroactive . The Supreme Court recently in the Oil case made decision that it was not , but the same decision also declared the constitution was retroactive . When the text is examined , it is found that it is of a kind with all Mexican decisions and decrees . It applies only to the case under consideration which is decided in favor of plaintiff or defendant , but with no general inter- pretation of the constitution by which one may declare what is the law of the land . AMERICANS EXIST IN MEXICO MY SUFFERANCE Briefly stated , there is no law in MexicO . Americans exist and operate properties there by sufferance . There is no change or amendment in the constitution by legisla ! tion or judicial decision . Hundreds of Americans have been slain and $500,000,000 of American property has been confiscated and there is no redress  --  only unsettled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation and is absolutely firm and unyielding that there is only one recognition of Mexico possible  --  protest and demand for readjustment . It is , however , recognized that the government of Obregon is in a difficult situation . To recognize the rights of American property interests is to raise an issue as to where Mexican property interests stand under a constitution where everything may be nationalized . Hence the declaration from Mexico that treaty with the United States is pot necessary or , at the present time , " convenient " . Mexico is in a state of constitutional nationalization , sovietism and anarchy . This is the revolution and it continues with variations . This is why Great Britain has turned down for the fifth time the application of Mexico for recognition . This is why the United States must continue to deny the application of Mexico for recognition until it signs such a treaty of commerce and amity as will give pledge for the security of American life and property . DISHONEST OR UNSOUND FINANCE Every loan made to Mexico has been on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not one dollar has been set aside for interest or principal either from customs or railways . Mexico continues in the possession and expenditure of her customs receipts and her railways  --  and continues bankrupt . Not long ago a statement was put forth for 1920 showing 215 million pesos revenue and 175 million expenditure . But when the Mexican papers began to ask where was the 40 million no explanation was forthcoming . Imitating some forms of so-called " high " finance , it may call certain expenditures " capital Recount . " The childish nature of Mexican finance is illustrated by the purchase of an expensive residence at Washington and the construction of an addition thereto that the representatives of Mexico may be properly quartered in a capital city where the Mexican government is not recognized . The United States , the richest country in the world , provides an office for its legal representatives in the City of Mexico and has no imposing palaces of State outside its borders .                  @ @ @
