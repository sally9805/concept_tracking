Among French men of letters of to-day , America has no more sincere and admiring friend than the Abbe Dirnnet . Always a student of American life and manners , and numbering among his friends hundreds of Americans who have come to know him abroad , he recently revisited this country after an absence of twelve years . He came to raise funds for the Catholic University of Lille . His mission took him to many parts of cur country . His notes on American life are the first published result of his travels . I ONCE heard an intelligent American woman remark that the common peoples are the real representatives of their respective nations . Cultivated people are very much alike in most countries . They show a tendency to generalize ; to get rid of the impedi ? menta of thought , belongs to cultivated minds in every country , but it is no ? where so visible as it is in America , except , possibly , in France . The differ ? ence between the best kind of conversa ? tion in London and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English people prefer facts and preserve the national taste for anecdotes , whereas the American shows a quick way of over ? hauling his data , obviously tending to seize them under their more general as ? pects . The German mark which Berlin or Jena sometimes left on the American professors I used to meet twelve years ago seems to have completely worn out . However ? luckily for America ? the waste of brilliant thoughts and felicitous speeches , which is the only extravagance of the French , has not found its way into even the most sophisticated milieus in the United States . Once or twice I thought I saw it appear in a few drawing-rooms or clubs in Chicago ? the clever , culture-cultivating modern Bos ? ton , now that Boston has become charm ? ingly simple and mellow ? but it was a mistake ; the pleasure which Americanstake in the play of their minds does not let them forget sober reality . I was con ? stantly conscious of this at a congress of Catholic writers and sociologists to which I was courteously invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play off the facets of his wit , and did so-to universal admiration , but as soon as he sat down and the happy smile on the lips of the audience sub ? sided , everybody went back to facts , and an almost British atmosphere set in. 1 noticed , with positive envy , that the more convincing and illuminating an orator was the less applause he received . In France even a Cato or a Socrates could not escape the destructive homage of applause ? I saw the echo of many a valuable speech killed by that barbarous uproar . Solid common sense of this kind be ? longs to the entire American population , but the flower of culture which I loved so much in the more refined circles is practically restricted to them ; and wealth , good clothes , and good looks be ? ing distributed in the United States , as in all lands of opportunity , by a blind goddess , the traveler is sometimes star ? tled by surprising contrasts . I remember a splendid-Iooking , ele ? gantly dressed young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duke 's son would have looked more distinguished . He started a literary conversation with the passenger opposite me ? a McGill girl , whom I am only waiting for a chance to report to her dean for imag ? ining that Vanity Fair is a dull , old-fashioned book . I became attentive , and I shall not easily forget my surprise at hearing this young god declare his partiality for a love story enlivened by " a kid with lots of deviltry in him . " He went on for a long time in perfect inno ? cence . I do not think that such a contrast would be possible in Europe ; the nouveau riche may once bring a gloom to the house decorator 's brow by asking him whether the books , too , are included in the sum agreed upon for a complete bookcase , but he will hardly repeat the slip ; his first chance of learning how to play the comedy of culture will be seized upon , and improved , and in no time he will know how to avoid dangerous reve ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in speaking of a picture , or " Capital , this ! " in speaking of a book . Nay , he may become a master of the jargon of literary or artistic admiration . I have often wondered at comfortable business men with sound , healthy minds reading the illustrated weeklies from cover to cover , including the advertise ? ments , till their minds grew faint and they yawned " pitifully . Hooks , maga ? zines , and newspapers to such persons are only substitutes for cigarettes . Tn fa , ct , passengers with a taste for speculation keep to that incomparable club , the smoking room of the Pullman car ? and I learned a vast deal in that narrow space . Uneducated Americans get bored the moment they are left to themselves ; you see them fidget , look round , produce a furtive whistling , fumble for a cigarette , or have recourse to their chewing-gum . The mere cud of contemplation has no charms for them , and thinking seems an insufferable ordeal unless it is imme ? diately to result in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have seen a business man call his secretary the moment an idea gleamed in his mind , and dictate a docu ? ment which an hour 's consideration would have improved wonderfully . The power of the American lies in his capacity for beginning over again that which lack of proper preparation has destined for failure . The weakness of the Frenchman is his inveterate pro ? pensity to defer action till every possi ? bility has been envisaged , or to amuse himself with complicated romances of enterprise never to he carried out . It takes a war to compel him to lay out his inventiveness in practical ventures . The press , with a few well-known and universally respected exceptions , does not endeavor to counteract this intellectual laxity American newspa ? pers provide far too much that . is merely cinematographic . The reporter in most of them is king , and he is the victim of a formula from which he never seems to escape . He insists on calling whatever he writes " a story " till the word reacts on his methods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him thoughts , or even that during his conversation with you he shows evident interest in the more intel ? lectual aspect of things . The moment he is released and finds himself in his shirt sleeves at his typewriter , a story comes . One day in a large city in the Middle West I had special reasons to keep the story out of a certain interview on which I founded very practical hopes . So , when the reporter I expected arrived ? a nice man with a pleasant expression and manner ? I was prepared with a care ? fully written statement which I just handed in to my visitor . While he read and I pretended to go on with my letters I could see on his face complete satisfac ? tion , which 1 put down to the fact that his work was practically done for him . In fact , he left without asking me a single question , and I was delighted at my own stratagem till the next day my eyes fell on the initial words of the inter ? view : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energetic Frenchman . . " It is a fight in America between the cinema or the story on one side and the university on the other . I , who spend my life crying over the deficiencies of the French newspapers , am surprised that no American philanthropist ever thought of the value which a newspaper published with the intention of teaching people how to think would have . American idealism is now at last a recognized fact . I remember the days when this conception had to displace an ? other , wrongly supposed to be diametri ? cally opposed , the idea of American prac ? ticality , but that fight has been won . America may be , some time or another , accused of being exaggeratedly idealistic , but even the most furiously selfish utter ? ances from the champions of the " Amer ? ica and nobody else " idea will not con ? vince the world that idealistic America is not . Idealism means a taste for ideas , and ideas are intellectual visions . In fact , there is nothing that the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This respect for the capacity certain men possess to see where others see not is not only a noble trait in the American nature , but it has a dynamic virtue , pro ? duces talent , and gives a unique chance to people who have something to say . Like everything else in human nature , it is apt to go astray and occasionally does so . The average American is credu ? lous ? I think I like him for it ? and imagines greatness where there is only novelty . This tendency is responsible for the quickly changing American fads . When I go hack to America in a few months I have little doubt but I shall find theosophy and psychic medicine as flourishing as when I left , but delicate people will have ceased to grow strong by standing on their heads ninety-five seconds every morning and evening ; something else of equally unexpected magic virtue will have been found . Fads arc laughable , but they are en ? couraging , as occasional extravagance in a normally generous man is encouraging VOL . CXLI. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coun ? trymen have no fads , but they lack responsiveness , and whoever has tried to work for anything primarily requiring enthusiasm must have felt the contrast between France and America painfully . Everybody knows that , while many inventions were born on French soil , hardly any were given a fair chance there . In most cases the inventors died on the eve of seeing at last their visions realized , or they saw them plagiarized and successful elsewhere . The French love ideas , love to play with them , to enchant themselves with their possi ? bilities , but they leave them after that . They feel certain that those attractive things will make their way somehow , and they do not bother about humdrum de ? tails of practical realization . Certain phrases of religion in America possess a real virtue . It is by no means an indifferent matter that the Catholic , Protestant , and Jewish com ? munions should speak of themselves as the Three Sisters . Nor is it insignifi ? cant that the adjective Jewish ( which in British English refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people . The difference re ? vealed , and partly created , by this usage is astonishing . The consequence is that in New York a Jew does not mean quite the same thing as a Jewish person . The word Jewess is hardly heard at all , and no ? body is afraid of calling himself Jewish . There is a tendency in America to present religion as a mere means to hap ? piness , or even as something useful . The Saturday advertisements emphasize this modern point of view with the outspok ? enness of business . People are coaxed to church as they are to the cinema , and the consequence seems to be that they feel partly condescending , partly taken in , when they go there . Faith-healing will no doubt be soon given a prominent place , and nobody should complain , as this practice is strongly founded on Scripture , tradi ? tion , and reason as represented by Psycho-Medicine ; but why should Mrs. Eddy have had to think of it first ? The tendency to outrun everybody in utility is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1919 , I copied the fol ? lowing from an address given at Pitts ? burgh by Reverend Doctor Thompson , of Chicago : There is every reason why our churches should fit up rooms with cozy corners where there is not too much light , so that city young persons may do their love-making under favorable circumstances . Sermons are no longer suffered to be dull . Sometimes they are positively amusing . This , of course , used to happen not infrequently in the past , but it was due to the quality , not to the effort , of the preacher . Now the intention is apparent . A non-Catholic friend of mine preaches as Chesterton writes ; his sermons leave on one the impression , invigorating yet not quite comfortable , that the world is crazy , but that we had better be prepared with some reserve of sense and seriousness if we want to live in it . It has occurred to me sometimes that we Catholics think too often of death and what comes after death ; that we console ourselves too easily for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies what is called " a good death . " But in America people , even religiously inclined , seem to think so much of the present life that they are unmindful of the next . Were it not for theosophy or the planchette many would hardly give a thought to the actual existence of the dead , which in Catholic countries is such a prominent feature of the religious life . No Protestant will admit of purgatory ( although many give definitions of it under the names of reincarnation or purification ) , and very few still believe in hell . There is a third proposition which , of course , is highly satisfactory , but even this is seldom and only vaguely mentioned . My conclusion is that America aims too exclusively at being an earthly paradise . A Frenchman who had no other belief than that which Unitarians teach would probably appear as cold as an atheist and as cynical as a skeptic . But I have met Unitarians in Boston whose religion ? not only their souls ? was decidedly warm and embracing . The generous American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that to a Frenchman Unitarianism would mostly be a negation , whereas to Channing it was only a broadening . A Bostonian would shiver over a Paris fire which gives the native an impression of luxurious comfort . I prefer the monotony of the rosary beads to many a harmonious , but hope ? lessly colorless , prayer I have heard in America , just as I can get more out of a peal of bells than out of much so-called music . The examination of conscience which the Episcopalians carried on for months in 1919 and 1920 , and which they called , not altogether accurately , their nation ? wide campaign , can be proposed for imitation to anybody , whether an indi ? vidual or a community . French Catho ? lics would do well , too , to copy a gigantic card index which the American Catho ? lics have accumulated in an office at Washington , and which tells them ex ? actly where they stand . When people make such inventories they not only obtain a clear view of their possibilities , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn them to account . I shall never forget the tender feeling which the Red Riding Hood girls of the Salvation Army gave me , ringing their bells over their Christmas pots at the bleak street corners downtown . They ought to have looked cold and worried ; they did neither , and , oh ! how elo ? quently they rang that bell ! I humbly request kind Americans who mean so much that is good to my native North of France to dissuade some people from trying to make Protestants of us . We should only be poor stuff , as my own Protestant friends no doubt realize . A Frenchman is better in his native unconverted state . If I were a rich Protestant and wished to improve religion in France I should adopt a truly American method . I should go straight to headquarters and do my best really to develop Catholi ? cism . I should endow seminaries , found convents , encourage people who fast and go barefooted , send the best Catholic literature to country priests who , with their eight hundred francs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of it . Alto ? gether I should act like the Chicago peo ? ple who had planned building the most modern of new hospitals at Reims , but found on investigation that it would be much wiser to repair a magnificent sev ? enteenth - century hotel Dieu , which managed to stand the brunt of the higher explosives , and only needs a lit ? tle modernizing . In fact , the sum of money which I brought back from America , and which came largely from non-Catholics , was destined for a Catholic , if a philan ? thropic , institution . Were these con ? tributors wise from the sectarian point of view ? This side of the question did not seem to worry them much . Were they wise from the religious point of view ? Undoubtedly . for one improve ? ment is worth a dozen changes where re ? ligion is the issue . American women are far and away the prettiest , youthfulest , and smartest ( clothes and brains ) women on earth . They can also be the sensiblest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean the hardest working ? and they have no rivals for charitable enter ? prise . They have a wonderful capacity for being excellent housekeepers , even though they may seem not to keep their houses more than a few minutes in the morning , before flying away , and an hour or two in the evening when they drop exhausted on a sofa . They are good mothers , good daughters , and good sisters , and their husbands , who oughtto know , proclaim to the whole world , to the earth and to the stars , to the believ ? ing and the unbelieving , that they are incomparable wives . I am ready to testify that they are invaluable friends . But somehow the American Woman has faults from which American women are free , and the latter frequently criticize her , to the disgust of the uncompromis ing American man . Everybody in America is agreed that Britishers are to he avoided as husbands ? I record what I have often heard . Why is it that the said Britishers used , in past generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent New England husbands the moment they were transplanted in the uxorious Amer ? ican soil ? Because there were , and still are , more men than women among emi ? grants , and economic laws concerning the scarcity or abundance of goods apply in every case . In England and France , and generally in all old countries , there is a providential excess of women , and men choose . A Frenchman marries when he needs help ; an American marries when he can afford it . American men are unrivaled in their politeness to women , even when they are not American gentlemen ; but , apart from the latter , they do not always con ? vince the observer , who sometimes suspects the possibility of an imitation , of a ritualism , or of an investment . American women expect ( very rightly ) from their husbands the same atten ? tion which French husbands receive from their wives . The American hus ? band expects nothing , and for what he receives the Lord makes him truly thankful . " We are pampered toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinctly resent ? ful tone , " but we only know it when our husbands , after keeping every trouble from us , suddenly die . " If the abstraction called The Amer ? ican Woman could be met with , I should ask her whether she really likes to see a dozen men in her drawing-room watch her the whole evening and bob up with military precision the moment she half rises to ring the bell ; whether she would not prefer her escort to think of what he is saying to her instead of concentrating on where she walks , skipping to the un ? protected side of her the whole time ; or whether she likes being supported across the road with infinite precautions , as if she were a very ill person or a very brit ? tle object ; or , on the contrary , firmly grasped below the shoulder and wafted to the other side with the triumphant ease of long practice . I have kept a picture representing three exceedingly well-know ? American men watching a lady go down a deck stairway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would probably think noth ? ing of scrambling down a rope ladder if it amused her . The steps on which she appears are broad and comfortable , but the gentlemen with guiding and sup ? porting gestures smile at her achieve ? ment with the same wonder and delight as if she were a baby for the first time off the gocart . Meanwhile the lady her ? self smiles in her furs like coy Phoebe between two clouds . I do not mind being pent up with my sullen kind and kept away from the ladies wherever I see the ghost of a rea ? son , but sometimes the reason is diffi ? cult to discover . What have we men done ? " One of the managers , " said the spokesman for the telephone girls who were quitting work at Norwalk , " placed a large piece of brown paper on the front screen door . This not only prevented fresh air from entering , but it prevented us from getting a peep at the few tnen who pass through the hallway . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admit we like to get a look at a man once in a while , even though he be only a married man . " This valuable evidence shows that it is not the women who want the men to herd away from them ; it can not be the men , either ; therefore it must he the secret council of Prohibitionists , and the American man is on the eve of being fooled again . Englishmen are always surprised when a foreigner notices with astonishment the petition in the Litany " that the no ? bility and gentry may have understand ? ing . " They have heard it so often that they notice it no longer . Americans are almost as surprised when they are told that Ibsen in some recent incarnation must have inserted " the pursuit of hap ? piness " in the austere constitution of their country . To many-these words are not by any means a familiar quota ? tion , and when they hear it they are emphatic in their denial that it ever had any effect on the national disposition . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their belief that happiness is the right , or even the duty , of man , and that whoever thinks differently must be an old Puritan or a dyspeptic Calvinist . French people still cherish the lesson banded down from the simple medicine of past generations , that you stand a good chance of being well if you keep " your head cool , your feet warm , and your heart cheerful . " But cheerfulness to the French of those wise epochs was the same thing with content , and con ? tent is terribly near resignation . The French girl was ( and still is ) taught that it faut 8ouffrir pour elre belle , and neither she nor her brother was very much sur ? prised to read in their religious books that we must suffer in order to be happy . Happiness in its highest meaning was regarded as something sacred , the initial stage of the celestial bliss . The crude modern notion which we express by the word happiness was condemned as an idol or a mirage born of the heat of pas ? sion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of a powerful effort on the part of many thinkers to show that happiness is only a vision like lib ? erty or equality , the impulse given by the doctrine of perfectibility a hundred and fifty years ago is still felt , and some mortals will be unhappy because they do not find themselves quite radiantly happy . I should advise American mothers to keep the pursuit of happiness out of their daughters ' constitution if they can not keep it out of their country 's . A girl who is given to understand every minute that she has a right to a good time is sure to declare before long that she wonders when the good time is com ? ing , even if she has it at every hour . Do not make fastidious artists in happi ? ness . Keep on the safe Puritan side ; it does not always mean thin lips and spectacled eyes shooting reproach around at random . I am afraid the idea of happiness is made an obsession by a great deal of apparently moral litera ? ture . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily doled out to hair-splitting girl questioners by dozens of Aunt Margarets or Cheery Mabels in the provincial newspapers , and the stuff we read last March in the pitiful diary of that Ruth Somebody who killed herself in Chicago because , she said , happiness was only a word . I heard a good deal that was unpleas ? ant to me because some American sol ? diers spread the notion that French women were loose , French churches were empty , and empty were most of the French cradles . An American writer who lived in Paris many years ? Mr. Theodore Stanton ? had to refute a statement made by the research secretary of a powerful " dry " organization to the effect that , " owing to the low moral standards of France , the destruction of this country has only been postponed ? she will be eaten by her own vices . " These impressions are those of super ? ficial observers , generally predisposed by so-called universal admission ( French literature immoral , legal existence of vice ) to make inferences in only one direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would ask Catholics , " How do you account for the presence in that corrupt country of mine of many more nuns and monks than America pro ? duces ? " and non-Catholics , " How could those decadents be the same men who fought at Verdun and patiently endured the trenches during four years ? " The same impressions can also be created by positive falsehoods . The powerful press owned and inspired by such a well-known American that I need not give his name once printed a so-called Parisian invitation to extraordi ? nary dancing parties which I vainly tried to put back into the French language ; it kicked at the indecency , thereby prov ? ing the impossibility of the charge . There was also circulated an anecdote concerning a French girl who married seven American soldiers . Ask any American who married even once in France , and knows what an enterprise it is , whether polygamy on such a scale is thinkable . This cant at the expense of France irritates many American young men ; it revolts most American women , and it angers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soldiers , had a chance to see something of a French family . These men and women feel , sometimes ? confusedly , that indulgence in this virtuous indignation arises from that strange interest in vice often de ? nounced by English and American moralists not moralizers ? which , feel ing disinclined to blame itself , only con ? demns the louder what has attracted it . Sometimes one finds oneself in. the presence of sheer hypocrisy . I find less fault with the readers ? I mean the buy ? ers ? of a certain illustrated gazette pro ? vided with a most unexpected title than with the above-mentioned press magnate who inveighs against French immoral ? ity , but helps the sale of his newspapers by daily and daring pictures of bathers in summer , of ballet dancers in winter . Also notice how greedily the same news ? papers pounce on every account or legal document that offers the kind of interest which is sometimes described as scan ? dalously French . A great deal of the unfavorable com ? ment passed on French morality comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that America is more virtuous in the daytime than by lamplight , and Mr. Stanton concluded the letter I men ? tioned above with the following remark : Anybody who really understands this matter in so far as it regards France ? I say realty understands it , for not one American in a thousand who runs through Paris grasps at all the true situation ? knows that this evil is not one whit more virulent in France than it is in other countries , not excluding the United States . There is often a difference in form , in practice , but in the main the same thing is there , no weaker and no stronger. ? Times , Sept. 13 , ' 19 . It also comes from the deep diversity in point of view noticeable between America and France , and which is , as usual , the outcome of habit . The French would be shocked if they saw what passes entirely unnoticed in Chicago during the months when this town be ? comes a very charming summer resort ? men and women walking the streets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave and the bathing machines . Again I find skeptics when I assure my countrymen that the love letters American boys and girls of fifteen exchange have no bad effects whatever . And the divorce ques ? tion is as much a source of illusions in America as it is in the countries where it is a less frequent practice . Americans used to think that many French girls proved disloyal wives because they had made a mariage de eonvenance , and one still meets with a few who have not ceased to think it is so . But is it not true that many a divorced couple in America started out with an undoubted love match and would have sworn that their lives would be perfectly Edenic ? On the other hand , is one very much surprised to hear an experienced Amer ? ican magistrate say that sixty divorces out of a hundred are not caused by any real incompatibility , or , above all , by any cruelly , and would never have taken place had not one of the parties had a more or less sudden vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that in America , as well as in France , we are confronted with the substitution of the right to happiness for a moral or religious principle . I am ready to admit that there is more sincerity and more morality in American life generally than is found in Europe . But it would be unwise to put this down to the influence of divorce . There are European coun ? tries in which divorce has long been practiced and which are not supposed to be exceptionally sincere or moral . This superiority of America , in my opinion , comes from the uncompromising spirit of the American woman . One third cause for the severity with which some Americans are inclined to judge France is a capacity for illusion which is not at all insincerity , but might easily he mistaken for it . This self ? illusionment appears strikingly in the questions one hears in the United States concerning the low birth rate in France . I have heard them whispered by people who had very small families themselves , and knew that I knew it . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of America , vaguely remembering the large Irish , Canadian , or Italian families which keep up the birth rate in the United States , or possibly feeling hereditary pride in the tradition that their own great-grand ? mother had seven sisters . A comforta ? ble , uncritical state of mind like this can belong to excellent people , and I have found it in Europe , too . Virtue by proxy is a distortion of patriotism , but how easily it can be regarded as an aspect of patriotism ! The real truth about French morals will be known and testified to by the American students who are flocking to the French universities . They will have a fair chance to sec and judge .
