txt Agitation for the installation of automatic train control devices with as little delay as possible has been accelerated here by tho Sunday morning wreck of the Twentieth Century Limited at Forsyth , N. Y .. In which nine were killed and thirty injured . Some officials are said to hold the opinion that an automatic train control device would have averted the wreck . Inspectors of the Interstate Commerce Commission 's Bureau of Safety are making an investigation . It is doubtful , however , if any new action will be taken by the commission until a complete report has been rendered , and this may require several weeks . A general order by the commission , directing the installation of automatic train-stop or train control devices on parts of forty-nine railroad systems was issued on June 13 , 1922 . It provided that installation must be completed by Jan. 1 , 1925 . This order was prepared under provisions of the Transportation act of 1920 . One of the systems Included was the New York Central , between Albany and Cleveland . The New York Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the order . The relation of the Interstate Commerce Commission to the s.tepe which have been taken up to this time to equip the railroads with safety devices is described in a report of W. P. Borland , Director of the Bureau of Safety , which was made available today . safety Devices in Sight . It records that during this year plans and specifications of sixty-five automatic train-stop , train-control and signal devices were presented for examination and report , twenty-five of which were revised plans and specifications of devices previously reported upon . The plans of sixty were examined and the opinions formulated thereon were transmitted to the proprietors or their agents . Of the number ex unined forty-five were considered impracticable , thirteen required further development and two possessed merit as safety devices warranting " some degree of commendation . " Both of the latter were automatic train-control devices , one of the intermittent magnetic induction type and the other of the continuous induction type . One device was tested on one loco ! motive and one track of the New York . Central electric ? division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intermittent magnetic induction type . The tests were begun in May . 1922 , and concluded last January , and the results demonstrated that the device had " inherent merit warranting a more extensive installation where the real value of this system can be more fully established . " Observation and teats of another device were made on the Southern Pacific Railway in California , and there were other tests in different parts of the country . The tests were discontinued last January , in view of the order issued by the commission on June 13 last year , prescribing specifications and requirements for automatic train-stop or train-control devices and directing fortynine carriers named to install such a device on one passenger division each , in connection with the engines operated thereon within designated limits , such installations to be completed by Jan. 1 , 1925 , and monthly reports on the tests to be filed . It is stated here that the commission does not insist upon the use of any particular device , the only point being that such devices as are adopted must meet the specifications set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Central officials announced yesterday , almost within twenty-four hours after the wreck at Forsyth , that practical steps had been taken to speed with automatic devices which would prevent by electrical control the passing of a signal " set against " a train . Automatic train control will completely stop a train in the case of a set switch , and thus eliminate the possibility of a repetition of such an accident as occurred to the Twentieth Century train on Sunday morning . When eventually automatic train control has been installed on the entire 27,000 miles of the system , it will have cost , according to present estimates , between $50,000,000 and $75,000,000 . An order of the Interstate Commerce Commission directs that certain divisions shall be thus equipped by Jan. 1 , 1925 . Bids for the first quota of the new protection will be opened by the New York Central on Dec. 28 . This is the equipment demanded under the I. C. C. order . It will be installed on five divisions covering 1.300 miles . Officials of the company said yesterday that specifications have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . There are 150 pages of these specifcations calling for a specific type of device that will bring a train to a quick , steady and complete stop in case of the failure of an essential on the locomotive ; on the failure of the engineer to observe a signal . or on the failure of a signal to operate . The device must hold the brakes tightly set until a corn , plete stop has been effected , and must operate regardless of the direction in which the engine is traveling . First Divisions For Control . The equipment called for will be in ' stalled on the New Fork Central from Albany to Syracuse ; on the Michigan Central from Detroit to Jackson , Mich. ; on the Cleveland , Cincinnati , Chicago &; St. Louis from Indianapolis to Mattoon ; on the Boston &; Albany from Springfield , Mass. , to Albany ; and on the Pittsburgh &; Lake Erie from Pittsburgh to Youngstown . These are the five divisions specified in the Interstate Commerce Commission order upon the Central and f3rty-eight other railroads . The Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Ohio have already complied . and since Sunday 's accident all the railroads are taking renewed interest in the subject . Representatives of the New York Central . it was said yesterday , have been at work trying to devise a train control device for more than twenty years . The first efforts were made just previous to 1902 . Since that time numerous laboratory experiments have been made , and in recent years the Central has expended considerable sums in testing suggested devices under varying conditions . Many difficulties have been encountered , however , in working out a system that would operate in any weather . One official said yesterday that it would have been a simple matter to evolve a system that would work If it were not for heavy snowstorms . Other systems were found that appeared to be satisfactory but were so constructed that they would have required the moving of station platforms , watering tanks , &c..; because these devices protruded over the present clearance space . Officials now expect that the bids on Dec. 28 will show that a practical device . does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitive . In that case construction will be started as soon as contracts are signed , and the Central officials hope to have the first 1,300 miles of control In operation not later than a year from next January . thus avoiding the heavy penalty which would be incurred by non-compliance with the Interstate Commerce Commission 's order .
