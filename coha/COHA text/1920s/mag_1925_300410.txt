After the French Debt Commission left Washington there was one brief scene of its American journey yet to be enacted . <P> On the train the weary M. Cai-llaux spoke to reporters . Some one told him of having paused before a window in Washington where pictures of the French Debt mission were displayed and of having heard a woman say : " Oh , how sly they look ! " " Ah yes ! " exclaimed M. Caillaux , with a weary irony . " The Wizard ! It is always the same . All people believe that foreigners would eat them if they could . " <P> At Manhattan automobiles carried the commissioners away for a busy afternoon . <P> M. Caillaux and part of the delegation were entertained by Hamilton Fish Armstrong , Editor of Foreign Affairs , at luncheon . The other guests included : Paul D. Cravath , John W. Davis , Herman Har-jes , Otto H. Kahn , Thomas W. Lament , Russell C. Leffingwell , James H. Perkins , Seward Prosser , Benjamin Strong , Paul M. Warburg , Walter Lippmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frank L. Polk . <P> Another section of the delegation was entertained at the Advertising Club . Later the delegation , was tea 'd by French residents at the Plaza Hotel , and in the evening just before sailing M. Caillaux dined with 400 members of the Lotus Club , Nicholas Murray Butler acting as toastmaster . Dr. Butler : <P> " We speak of debts ; for more than 2,000 years the modern world has been trying to pay its debt to ancient Greece , and the obligation grows heavier rather than lighter with each passing year-So it will be with France . <P> " Gentlemen , hail and farewell . <P> We offer you at once welcome and bon vonaae . May favoring breezes and kindly seas make your homeward journey pleasant and may you always remember that , however difficult the public business upon which you have been engaged , you went out to your ship from the Lotus Club amid the cheers and good wishes of sincere and affectionate friends of France . " <P> And M. Caillaux , weary , hoarse , replied : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent situations . I am so confused I hope they will conserve of me the same memories I have of them . . . . <P> " It is not a question of gratefulness on either part . If perhaps America owes us something , we also owe her a great deal . These facts are in every mind . <P> " To the heart of America I appeal , with no other thought than to ask all the people of America to look at my country with the same sentiments that were expressed here a few minutes ago by President Butler . <P> " Leaving your beautiful land and your friendly citizens , I bring to France memories of the kindest greeting I ever had , of the most gracious , kindly and generous treatment on every hand . " <P> At 11:00 p. m. the France went down the harbor .
