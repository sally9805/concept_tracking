" There seems now to be a group in the church itself which holds that the church may ' consider with open mind ' sanctioning fornication among our young people with the use of birth control to guard against the coming of children . This is , in plain words , what the high-sounding phrase ' companionate marriage ' means , and yet this proposal was mentioned as one to which consideration should be given at the recent church conference in San Francisco Protestant Episcopal Church Congress and its consideration is being commended by not a few professors in our universities . . . . " <P> This was but part of the declaration that Bishop William T. Manning made just before he sailed for England last week to preach on July 3 at the 1,300th anniversary of York Minster . The bishop of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of New York , the overseer of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , went on : <P> " And I see that a prominent preacher in this city Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick if he is correctly reported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the idea of ' trying to send a new generation into the world with a definite code of " right and wrong " ' and told those young people that the old ideas of ' right ' and ' wrong ' have been dropped and that the criterion of behavior is simply what we happen to regard as ' beautiful ' and ' ugly ' - which means , I suppose , that there is no longer any law of God which is binding upon us and that our only standard is our own taste of preference . If this is true , if there is no law of God which must be obeyed we need not wonder if our young people adopt ' companionate marriage ' or any other suggestion . Judge Lindsey 's advocacy of ' unmarried unions ' TIME , Jan. 24 , Feb. 28 is publicly commended by college professors , writers and other well-known people , among some ministers of religion . . . . <P> " It is time for us to say that the advocacy of ' unmarried unions ' and ' sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and an affront to all right-minded people , both young and old . And it is time for us to see to it that we know what is being taught to our children in our churches and in our universities . . . . " <P> All this scolding Bishop Manning based upon hasty , sensationalized newspaper accounts of two addresses by clerics . Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick of the Park Avenue Baptist Church , Manhattan , last week made one of these addresses to students at the 49th commencement of Smith College at Northampton , Mass . Rector Henry Lewis of St. Andrew 's Church , Ann Arbor , Mich , ( site of the University of Michigan ) made the other before the Protestant Episcopal Church Congress at San Francisco a fortnight ago . Each man made earnest plea for the revaluing of moral ( ethical ) standards , and in each case newspapers " played up " their comments on sex standards .
