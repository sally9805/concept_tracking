Discouraged producers , especially in Michigan , are now turning to tariff legislation as the only visible means of running their properties at a profit . The movement has resulted in a bill introduced by Representative W. Frank James of Michigan , to place a tariff on imported copper of 6 a pound . <P> This import , by withdrawing the cheap copper imported from South America from the domestic markets , would favor home production at high operating costs .

Meanwhile , the aluminum industry is furnishing the copper trade with stiff competition in several fields wherein the latter has previously had things much its own way . By weight , aluminum is much cheaper than copper , and is being used to an increasing extent in electric transmission , as a heavy saver of electric current .
