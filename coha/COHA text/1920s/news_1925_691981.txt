txt There is every expectation that American Agricultural Chemical Corp . will enjoy a good year in the 19251926 season , and both volume of plant food sold and profits thereon should be larger than the excellent showing for the season just concluded . Annual reports of the various fertilizer companies , including that of the American Agricultural Chemical , plainly indicate that not only has the turn come in the fertilizer business , but that all the leading companies are once more on their feet and will be in a position to benefit therefrom . American Agricultural Chemical , after four disastrous years growing out of the agricultural debacle of 1919-1921 , showed earnings applicable to the $28,455 200 outstanding preferred stock of $7.19 . a share for the year ended June 30 . This compares with net earnings of but $112,463 in the previous year . As a result of writing off war expansion and frozen receivables , many of which the company was obliged to regard as permanently frozen , a profit and loss deficit developed which on June 30 , last , totaled $17,860,237 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 1,41 in back dividends an the 6% preferred stock will have to be taken care of . Although no plan is under consideration at the moment , it is only a question of time when the directors will formulate one and it is not unlikely that either later this year or early next year the directors will take care of the matter . The Street expects that the par value of the common will be changed to look after the bookkeeping deficit and that the back dividends will be looked after by a new security issue , probably additional preferred stock . The report for the year ended June 30 showed a very strong working capital position . Current liabilities were cut from $3,562,51 ( i to $1,977,078 by payment of approximately $1,500,000 in notes payable . Bonded indebtedness was reduced to $31,105,500 from ** Cash position was strong , with a total of $0,265,507 , nearly twice the total of the previous year . Current assets at $34 , - 247,792 were practically the same as the previous year . This showed a ratio of nearly 17 to 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history . One of the most important factors growing out of the troubles of the fertilizer companies is the determination of the companies to go out of the " banking " business . Fertilizers are now sold largely on a cash basis , in fact American Agricultural Chemical sold by far the great portion of its plant food on a cash basis compared with a credit basis in previous times . It is evident that this situation has come to stay , and although profits are smaller the risks are likewise and with all hands doing business on a cash basis the fertilizer managements ' will be in a position to control their credit situation , which has been virtually impossible through the trying times of the last five years .
