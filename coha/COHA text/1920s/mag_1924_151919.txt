For many years physicians have been interested in the rate of progress of food residues in their passage through the body . In making tests , patients have been required to swallow insoluble matter , such as small pieces of metal and charcoal or dye substances , which could be easily detected in the excretion . When the X-ray was discovered , barium sulphate , which is opaque to the Xray , was given , and the passage of the barium was observed through the fluoroscope . The giving of a large amount of indigestible material like barium with a small amount of milk or gruel , however , brings about conditions within the bowels which are hardly similar to the normal passage of food . <P> Twenty years ago , two English physiologists studied the distribution of food along the digestive tract by giving to rabbits large numbers of small glass beads . Then the rabbits were killed at various intervals , and the distribution of the material throughout the stomach and intestines was noted . Recently , Doctors Walter C. Alvarez and B. L. Freedlander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Research in the University of California Medical School , used a similar method in studying passage of food through the human body . They found that the normal individual with good digestion and a daily excretion does not in 24 hours pass anything like 100% of the material given . Fifty small beads were placed in a gelatin capsule and swallowed . These colored beads were given on three consecutive days ; and the excretions were sieved so as to determine when the beads , and how many of them , were recovered . The beads used were very small , about two millimetres in diameter . Two of the individuals studied passed around 85% of the beads in 24 hours ; but most took four days to get rid of 75% ; and there were some who passed from only 50 to 60% in nine days . On an average , 15% of the beads were passed at the end of the first day ; 40% on the second ; 15% on the third ; and from 5 to 10% on the fourth and fifth - so that between 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one person who suffered with chronic constipation , careful sieving until all of the beads were accounted for showed that the last one came through on the 40th day . Since the beads had been mixed with the food , it is obvious that the individual 's food residues also must have required this amount of time for passage . <P> The conclusions from this work are that wide variations in the rate of passage of food through the body are perfectly compatible with good health . All of the persons tested seemed to be normal on examination ; and none of them admitted having poor digestion or poor health . Nevertheless , the rate of the movement of food varied greatly from very slow to very fast in the group of persons studied . The studies seemed to show also that the giving of purgative drugs , or that spontaneous , repeated emptying of the bowels results in such thorough emptying that no further excretions should be expected the next day , or even for one or two days following . The California physiologists also believe that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " autointoxication. "
