There were flowery floats and cars and trucks , old-fashioned wagons banked up , and festooned with a multitude of roses . All through the streets of Pasadena they went , and the populace made carnival , rioting , waving , singing , skipping ; wearing roses , smelling roses , throwing roses , wading through roses . For months , a committee had planned it all , the parade and pageant of the Tournament of Roses. + <P> Gradually the streets of Pasadena emptied as the rout and revel wound out to the Rose Bowl for the annual East-West football game . On a bench in the stadium , Coach Knute Rockne of Notre Dame stroked his jaw as he watched Leland Stanford , in the first few minutes of play , inexorably shoving his team toward its goal line . The Bowl was bedlam , for most of the 55,000 persons present wanted to see Coach Rockne 's team shoveded right off the field . Rockne was not worried , merely pensive . He relinquished his jaw , called to him four young men and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crowley and Layden , you may now proceed with the matter in hand . ' ' <P> Off came their sweaters , out they trotted , back to the bench came Notre Dame 's second string backfield . Halfback Cuddeback of Stanford had scored a field goal . Fullback Nevers of Stanford had been shooting passes that gained and gained . Now the Four Horsemen* started their galloping . Now one , now the other , now the third and fourth , they ran , plunged , dodged , wriggled , twisted . Stuhldreher wrenched his ankle . Layden bored through for a touchdown . A few Stanford plays , a bulletlike pass by Nevers , and it was Layden again who leaped to the interception . The field streamed after him for 70 yards to another score . In the third period , Quarterback Solomon of Stanford stooped to recover a punt he had fumbled on his 20-yard line . In swooped Huntsinger , upset Solomon , cantered to a third Notre Dame touchdown . Crowley kicked his third extra point . <P> Then Notre Dame flaunted her power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevers of Stanford pulled it down and proceeded furiously to hurl his 200 pounds into the Notre Dame <P> ( Continued from Page 29 ) <P> line . It crumbled at guard , it crumbled at tackle , it might have crumbled again , but Halfback Walker whipped a pass over the line to Left End Shipkey and the huge Nevers ' pounding was no longer necessary . Cuddeback kicked goal . <P> In the fourth period , Baker intercepted a pass and Nevers again pulverized a path for Stanford . That time Notre Dame stayed him at the 8-inch line , however ; and before the whistle blew , Horseman Layden frisked away six points of good measure . Score : <P> Notre Dame 27 , Leland Stanford 10 . <P> <P> At Berkeley , the Golden Bears of the University of California basked in balmy sunshine , padded out upon their velvety gridiron , watched eleven red-and-blue-bellied men of Pennsylvania assume positions opposite . The Bears gave greeting , sprawled and stretched genially , <P> ambled to the encounter . Their breed had not been beaten since 1919 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Excellent . <P>
