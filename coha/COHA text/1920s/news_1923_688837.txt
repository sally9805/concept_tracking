txt At a conference today between the President and the Shipping Board it was decided to consolidate the board 's foreign trade lines into.eighteen or twenty-five routes and then offer the ships in these lines for sale under a guarantee of maintained service for a period of years . After the lines have been consolidated and routed they , as well as the surplus ships , Nyill be offered for sale . If , as maintained by the ship operators and the ship owners , there are no justifiable offers made for the ships , the Government will enter upon an aggressive Government ship operation program . The tentative program , as announced by the President in a formal statement , and later amplified by A. D. Lasker , Chairman of the United States Shipping Board , may be changed slightly in the conferences which will be held in the coming weeks . The essential agreement reached today when tile board submitted its reasons , was that Government-owned Millis would not be sacrificed , . and if after the lines had been consolidated , ' there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the President and the board opposed ? och a course , would be forced to operate the ships in a practical business wayAs to selling the ships or operating them , Mr. Lasker said that the bide ' for the ' next sixty days will tell the 3tFgroY1-10 ? vsing the two-hour conferen641 the White House this statement autlitil ?

" After an extended conference with the full membership of the Shipping Board , and a thorough discussion of the ' Problems to be solved , the board unanimously agreed , with the President 's concurrence , that the chief end to he sought is the establishment and maintenance of an American merchant marine . With the failure ot the Subsidy act , the board i is confronted with its vast possession of Shim , and the heavy Tosses under the existing plan of allocated operations , winder managing agents .

In short , there is unanimous agreement that the existing law contemplates and authorizes an . adequate and maintained American merchant marine , and such a course will 7 e followed as will fully guarantee it and contemplate its larger development . " In discussing the agreement later Mr. Lasker said that while every effort will be made to keep . the Government out of business , yet the President was determined that the people wanted the Government to keep the American flag on the seas and Congress had given full authority for Government operation in the Jones act . There is $50,000,000 available for the next fiscal year for Government operation of ships and this money will be used , with the belief on the part of the Shipping Board that it will be sufficient to keep all trade lines open to Anierican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If within the next few weeks , " said Mr. basker , elaborating upon the more general White House statement , " we can not get satisfactory offers from the ivate operators we have encouraged as P tential customers  --  and we do not in an to sell three or four cream routes and leave the Government holding the bag as to the , rest  --  we shall carry out the program of Government operation and answer the question ' how shall America stay on the high seas ? ' " Nobody bates Government ownership and operation more than I do . I have been consistently against it and so has ' the board ' and the President , but I and the board have finally recommended , in view of the present situation , that we cut out doing business on the cargo lines through agents and go direct and on a larger scale to Government operation . " Congress refused a subsidy to private shipping .

Congress did appropriate after only a few minutes ' debate ** for the operatipns of the Shipping Board for the next fiscal year , beginning July 1 .

" The President and the Shipping Board are determined to use this opportunity to the end that America shall not only be free on the seas , but shall adequately play its part in the commerce of the world . Wo n't Interrupt Present Services . " All shipping companies , under any flag , seem to be losing money now , but dais ' Government can not leave the seas to foreign competition . I want to say that no service now given by our operators will be interrupted if it becomes necessary for the ' United States to take over operation on its own account . ? ? The point I want to make is this . that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ahead as any one can see in this generation , it will be possible to ship on American vessels .

To Ask Congress for More Money . Outside of that , he said , the Shipping Board would go to Congress next December and ask for a construction appropriation to put more specialized cargo ships into operation . However , he said , this appropriation was not vital and the board could get along , although the appropriation was desirable . The suggested plan of Government operation , he added , primarily concerned cargo routes and not passenger routes , since the passenger business now seemed satisfactorily organized by the private operators and was to be considered independently of the freightcarrying vessels .

M8.9 Not Find Purchasers . Mr. Lasker said this Government was willing to sell at " market price " any of its vessels without maintenance of service guarantee . He recited that twenty-three oil tankers , quite a percentage of the few hundreds of tankers now in service , had been sold unconditionally at market price within recent months . However , operators who buy at less than market must give guaranties . The Shipping Board Chairman admitted that preliminary reports about the intention of " potential customers " to purchase the ships they had been operating were pessimistic . While Mr. 3-esker admitted he was a bit discouraged by the informal comment of operators as to the possibility of the sale of Shipping Board vessels , he added that the bids for the next Sixty days will tell the story . " The operators , he said , might be bluffing , and if they are bluffing they will eventually buy the ships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend'to hold aloof as bids are called for , then . Mr. Lasker said , with the approval of the Administration , the United States , under the authority ct the Jones bill and the $60 000,000 already voted by Congress , will go ahead and really begin Government operation of a merchant marine and keep it up until a national shipping policy is enunciated by Congress or the American nation determines that it wants to get off the seven seas .
