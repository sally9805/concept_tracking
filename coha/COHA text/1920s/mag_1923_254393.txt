Political news from Tokio is full of ominous rumblings , but thus far the Kato government has withstood the onslaughts of the opposition . The House of Peers called upon the government , of which Baron Kato is Prime Minister , to " consolidate its diplomatic policy , " describing it as " retrogressive and weak " - particularly in China . This gave the cue to the opposition in the Lower House , who brought forward a motion expressing lack of confidence in the Cabinet . Kato , however , was strong enough to defeat it by an overwhelming majority . <P> Kato may attempt further to strengthen his position by embracing a measure granting some extension of suffrage .
