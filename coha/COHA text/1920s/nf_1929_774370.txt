For the protection of the individual consumer , Congress , in 1898 , passed the bottled in bond act . This law permitted dividing the product in fractions of a gallon , each package having a United States little green stamp pasted over each cork , showing the distillery where made , the size of the package , the date of manufacture , and a guarantee of freedom from rectification . This guarantee followed a rigid investigation of the wiles of the rectifier , carried on in 1898 , in which the Bureau of Chemistry took an active part . It was then learned that there was a radical difference between a genuine whisky at least four years old and the rectified product bearing the same name .

After its passage they moved heaven and earth , or better , hell and earth , to nullify its provisions . In the following pages will be found the high lights of these efforts . In the final hearings the rectifiers made every possible endeavor to kill the bill . Anticipating the probability of the passage of the bill , it was deemed advisable to study ab initio the whole question , historical and technical , of the manufacture of whisky in this and other countries . The investigations made by the Bureau of Chemistry covered fundamentally all angles of the problem . The results were collected in typewritten form and were the basis of all the testimony before the courts in the cases subsequent to the passage of the  | law . A witness to the sound conclusions drawn therefrom is the universal approval given by every Federal court before which the problem has been presented . No further publication of this brief has been made . I have , as one of my most precious documents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the document called for by . Judge Thompson of Cincinnati in the effort of the rectifiers to have Food Inspection No. 65 declared illegal . In closing the discussion of the pending food bill before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee in 1906 , the following reference to whisky ( page 1122 ) was made : Now we are ready , Mr. Chairman , for a short talk on whisky , if my assistants will bring the samples forward . I will not call attention to the testimony of Mr. Hough , because he was not under oath ; it is not expert testimony , but I want to say just this in regard to his contention : As you know , I was instructed last year , with a view of executing our food law respecting imported food products , to visit the manufacturers in Europe , as far as I could in the time I had at my disposal ; and , especially , I was instructed by the Secretary to visit the distilleries in Scotland and Ireland , where Scotch and Irish whiskies are made . I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I was assigned . Laughter . I was also instructed to visit the Charente to see how the real French brandy is made , and the Gironde to see how the real French wines are made , and the Rhine and Mosel to see how the real German wines are made . I spent three months in this very delightful task , On my return I made a report to the Secretary of Agriculture , which he gave , in abstract , to the press , and which was published all over this country and in Europe . I stated that I had found that in Scotland whisky was made solely from pure barley malt , fermented in the proper way and distilled in a pot still , and that nothing else , in my opinion , was entitled to he called Scotch whisky except that product . I stated also that in Glasgow and Edinburgh I found distilleries importing American maize , Indian corn ? I was glad t hey were doing it ; it is a good market for us ? and making a  | spirit out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Scotch whisky and sent to this country ; and I doubted if there was a barrel ? and that was about true , as events have shown ? of real Scotch whisky in the United States . I went to Ireland , and I found that whisky was made there exactly as it is in this country in Kentucky , just as Mr. Taylor ( who is the only expert called on the question ) has testified it was made . It is made there of barley malt and unmalted grain , just as in this country , the malt being used to convert the rest of the starch , and then it is fermented and distilled in a pot still and placed in the warehouse , just as it is in England and in Scotland . In this country , too , we have great distilleries of spirits which make immense quantities of alcohol , and our law permits the mixing of different spirits , under what is known as the rectifiers ' clause of the internal-revenue law , which says that anyone who " mixes without rectifying " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandy shall be deemed to be a rectifier and must take out a rectifier 's license . So that the law specifically says in this country that every mixed whisky is a spurious imitation of whisky . That is the act of Congress of the United States , a pretty good authority when it comes to definitions of that kind . I said to the Secretary that in my opinion , if I were enforcing the law about whiskies coming to this country ? I am not ; I have simply tried to get all the information I could , and f did not want to begin to enforce a law without knowing what I was doing ? I believed I could exclude from this country , under our law , any of these rectified whiskies which were offered . At that time , while I was in London , they were about to begin a great trial , which it was said would be the greatest trial that ever took place in that city in regard to a manufactured product , in which a publican had been cited under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not of the character , quality , and kind demanded . That is the language of the English food act , and a very good one it is . That one sentence is the whole essence of the act . This publican was cited to appear . He was defended by the greatest lawyer in England , Mr. Frederick Moulton , the leader of the English bar ; and I was told that $50,000  | ( $10,000 ) had been raised simply to pay the legal expenses of e defense . This poor publican was worth nothing , but he was the man who was charged with this offense , and this great rectifying industry was behind him . They wanted to establish e fact that a rectified whisky was a Scotch whisky ; and that as what this suit was brought for , to show that it was not . I was asked to go over there as a witness , and of course I could not go ; but they introduced my report to the Court , which the judge promptly ruled out unless they produced me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cablegram from London : " Wiley , Agricultural Department , Washington .

I will admit , for the sake of argument , that it is better than the straight whisky . I will admit it for the sake of the argument ; I do not really think No , but I will say that it is better . That is what the magistrate said . I got the printed proceedings of the trial as they came off every week ; they sent out a bulletin , and they had expert witnesses to testify that the rectified whisky was less injurious , had less poisonous matter in it than the straight whisky , and the magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , why not say This is a rectified whisky ' ? because then you will get the trade .

BARTLETT : It was sold as Scotch or Irish whisky ? DR . WILEY : It was sold as Scotch or Irish whisky . MR . BARTLETT : And it turned out to be a rectified whisky . MR .

That covers this whole contention .  | When Lloyd Bowers reached the opinion that a neutral spirit , even one made from grain , was not entitled to the designation of whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to understand why he decided that this article which was not a whisky could be added to real whisky , and then the mixture could be called whisky , provided the characteristics of the real whisky would not be too greatly diluted . Especially is this true when he had before him , not only the decisions of the Federal Courts , but also the opinion of the father of President Taft to the effect that neutral spirit was an entirely different article from whisky . He also had before him the opinion : of the English Courts contained in Bureau of Chemistry Bulletin No. 102 , issued Dec. 20 , 1906 . I give here a synopsis of the decision of the English case : A whisky claimed to be Irish on the one hand and a second sample which claimed to be Scotch on the other , was sold to a customer as the best Irish and the best Scotch whisky . On analysis it was determined that it contained not less than 90% of silent or neutral spirit made of maize .

" Great blame attaches , in my opinion , to the blenders ' who supplied Wells and Davidge with the articles they sold . I do not think much moral blame attaches to the defendants themselves , as I believe they trusted to those who sold the articles to them to supply them with that which they might  | fairly and honestly retail to the public as Irish and as Scotch whisky , respectively ; but at the same time , in my judgment , it was careless of the defendants to sell what they did as they did , and since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their infringement of the law . * * * The defendants , Thomas Samuel Wells and James Davidge , will each pay a fine of 20s and 100 pounds costs or be imprisoned in default of distress for two months in the second division . To continue the quotation from the final hearings : " Now , I say that that is a business which is perfectly legitimate in this country . I am sorry that our laws are so hard on the man who makes a straight whisky , and so easy on those who make the mixed whisky ; because you can not make or sell straight whisky except under a Government stamp , under Government supervision . You can add nothing whatever to it , not even coloring matter , except that when you take it out of bond and sell it you are permitted to reduce it with distilled water under the supervision of Government officials , to proof ? that is , half alcohol and half water . That is the only thing that can be done . Then , if it is in a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that it is whisky right out of the distillery . It can be sold in bottles ; you can pay the tax on it and take it out of bond and put it up in any shape you please , or you can , under the law , if you want to , have it bottled in bond . Those are the three forms in which straight whisky can reach you . It can come in barrels , or it can be put up in any kind of a package you please after you pay your tax on it , it makes no difference what ; or it can come bottled in bond , as this is . If any of you have never seen a bottle of whisky bottled in bond , this is one . MR . RYAN : The fact that it is bottled in bond is no evidence of purity or quality ? DR . WILEY : It is evidence of quality ; it shows that nothing has been added to it except what nature put in the distillate . MR . RYAN : Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whisky he is doing something deleterious to health ?  | DR . WILEY : I do not think he intends to . He may do it unwittingly . MR . RYAN : The blenders and the wholesale liquor dealers and rectifiers in New York , for instance , are very much disturbed abottt this . I will state that I have received some seventy or eighty telegrams since last evening in connection with this matter . They fear that this law will show to the public , or attempt to show to the public , or the public will assume , that whisky bottled in bond is the proper thing and will injuriously affect their business , when , as a matter of fact , it is no evidence of quality or purity that it is bottled in bond , as you state now yourself . DR . WILEY : Oh , I do not think you have quite quoted me , Mr. Ryan . I said it was a guaranty of quality . MR . RYAN : Of quality , yes . DR . WILEY : But the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With regard to foods , I never use the word " purity " except in one sense . A pure food is what it is represented to be . It has nothing to do with its wholesomeness at all . A pure food may be unwholesome , as has been testified here . You will see in my manuscript there that in showing what things occur in nature in foods I show that hydrocyanic acid , the most violent poison , occurs in a great many food products . They are pure foods , but they contain poisonous matter . " The food bill became a law June 30 , 1906 . Immediately activities were begun by the fake whisky interests to nullify its requirements . Rectifiers appeared by counsel ' or in person before the committee forming rules and regulations to carry the law into effect . They made no impression on that body . They then began to get in touch with the Secretary of Agriculture . These rectifiers were deeply in earnest . They wanted to know " just where they were at . " They feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is one of the problems propounded :  | Many letters are received by the Department making inquiries concerning the proper method of labeling blended whisky . Manufacturers are anxious to know the construction placed by the Department upon this particular part of the food and drugs act of June 30 , 1906 and to ascertain under what conditions the words " blended whisky " or " whiskies " may be used . The following quotation from one of these letters presents a particular case of a definite character : " On On account of the uncertainty prevailing in our trade at the present time as to how to proceed under the pure-food law and regulations regarding what will be considered a blend of whiskies , I am taking the liberty of expressing to you to-day two samples of whisky made up as follows : " Sample A contains 51 per cent of Bourbon whisky and 49 per cent of neutral spirits . In this sample a small amount of burnt sugar is used for coloring , and a small amount of prune juice is used for flavoring , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sample B contains 51 per cent of neutral spirits and 49 per cent of Bourbon whisky . Burnt sugar is used for coloring , and prune juice is used for flavoring , neither of which increases the volume to any great extent . " I have marked these packages blended whiskies ' and want your ruling as to whether it is proper to thus brand and label such goods . " My inquiry is for the purpose of guiding the large manufacturing interests in the trade that I represent . " In a subsequent letter from the same writer the following additional statement is made : " The reason for wanting your decision or ruling in this matter is just this : No house in the trade can afford to put out goods and run the risk of seizure and later litigation by the Government on account of the odium that would be attached to fighting the food and drugs act . " To this a formal answer was prepared by the Bureau of Chemistry , and signed by the Secretary .  | The question presented is whether neutral spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored and flavored and the resulting mixture be labeled " blended whiskies . " To permit the use of the word " whiskies " iii the described mixture is to admit that flavor and color can be added to neutral spirits and the resulting mixture be labeled " whisky . " The Department is of the opinion that the mixtures presented can not legally be labeled either " blended whiskies " or " blended whisky . " The use of the plural or the word " whisky " in the first case is evidently improper for the reason that there is only one whisky in the mixture . If neutral spirit , also known as cologne spirit , silent spirit , or alcohol , be diluted with water to a proper proof for consumption and artificially colored and flavored , it does not become a whisky , but a " spurious imitation " thereof , not entirely unlike that defined in Section 3244 , revised statutes . The mixture of such an imitation with a genuine article can not be regarded as a mixture of like substances within the letter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Secretary of Agriculture . Washington , D. C. , December 1 , 1906 . Early in January , 1907 , in the very first days of the enforcement of the law it was discovered that the Secretary of Agriculture was very much perturbed in regard to F. I. D. 45 . At that time the star of the Solicitor of the Department was rapidly increasing in brilliancy . The time was speedily approaching when the head of the Department became only the vehicle to carry the will of the Solicitor into action . I was cited to appear in the Secretary 's office on the 22nd of February , 1907 , for a conference on the whisky question . The birthday of Washington was used to perpetrate the first overt act against the food law . There were present at this conference the Secretary , and the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture , the Solicitor , Mr. George P. McCabe , and the Chief of the Bureau of  | , hemistry . The conference began by a statement by the Secretary that this conference should be behind osed doors and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press . I was first asked by the Secretary if the Bureau of Chemistry still held to the principles contained in F. 1 . 1 ) . 45 . I replied in the affirmative . He asked the Assistant Secretary , Mr. Hayes , his opinion in the matter . Mr. Hayes promptly voted in favor of the Bureau 's definition of whisky . He then asked the Solicitor his opinion . He replied , " Dr. Wiley 's definition of whisky is absurd . Whisky is any alcoholic beverage made from grain , properly colored and flavored , according to the prevailing custom of the trade . " The Secretary said , " I agree with my Solicitor . " I immediately called his attention to the fact that there was only one body appointed by the Act to make an initial decision as to what constituted misbranding or adulteration of foods and drugs , namely , the . Bureau of Chemistry . The only authority recognized by the Act to review this decision was , a United States judge . I said , " The Bureau of Chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . " He replied , " I I will not take your construction of the law , but that of my Solicitor ; that is what he is here for , to interpret the law to me . " This act of the Secretary and Solicitor constituted the first abrogation of the Food Law by executive authority and laid the foundation for a succession of similar violations . As a matter of history I may say that I obeyed the Secretary 's injunction to make no report of this matter to the press . Immediately on leaving his office I went to the Cosmos Club and called up Mr. Loeb , secretary to President Roosevelt . I related to him  | what had happened in the Secretary 's office and asked him if he could come over to the Club and take luncheon with me . Loeb was immediately and greatly interested in this decision . I pointed out in detail all the circumstances which led to it . I felt certain that Secretary Wilson would go to President Roosevelt with this illegal decision . I asked Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a promise from him , if possible , that he would not give his approval to Secretary Wilson 's decision until I had an opportunity to lay the whole matter before him . Later in the day Mr. Loeb called me over the telephone and said the President had agreed to this delay . Meanwhile the papers were full of this decision . It had been given to the press by some one of the four people who were present at the conference . I was not the one who gave it to the press . The following day was one of rejoicing by the rectifiers all over the country . They felt assured that F. I. D. 45 would be repealed without carrying the matter to the courts . There was a slight error in their judgment . For two weeks subsequent to this event the newspapers were filled with accounts of pilgrimages , under the leadership mostly of United States Senators , of bodies of rectifiers to the White House . Senator Foraker conveyed the rectifiers from Cincinnati . Semitor Lodge accompanied those from Boston . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting word from President Roosevelt . One day while I was taking lunch at Harvey 's a telephone message from my office said the President would see me at two o'clock . I had prepared a movable laboratory with all the elements necessary to manufac- ture ten year old Bourbon or Scotch in a minute . I carried with me samples of pure , refined alcohol from half a dozen different sources , namely from corn , barley , molasses , and fruits , all alike in character , and all of equal degree of purity . I carried an assortment of colors and flavors used by the rectifiers . When I drove up to the White House with this peripatetic laboratory , I encountered a dozen or more newspaper men who were eager to know what it all meant . I told them I had been invited to give a lecture to the President of the United States . One of the well-informed correspondents said to me : " You may think so , but you will find that the President will do the lecturing . " I carried my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by the attendant and told that the President would soon be in . In five minutes my audience appeared , the President of the United States , and Mr. William Loeb , his secretary . For two hours I performed experiments showing the President how all kinds of rectified whisky , brandy and rum could be made in a minute . I received his undivided attention . If he interrupted me at all it was only to ask for more definite information on some points . At the close of this two hour lecture he came around to my side of the table and grasped my hand , saying to me , " Dr. Wiley , I have heard nothing but whisky for the last three weeks , and you are the first person who has ever given me a single idea that I can comprehend . " Then turning to Mr. Loeb he said , " Send all these documents and samples , together with Dr. Wiley 's brief to Mr. Bonaparte , and ask Mr. Bonaparte to advise me on this question . " Mr Bonaparte did advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented by the Bureau as to what is really whisky . President Roosevelt ordered the Commissioner of Internal Rev- enue and the Secretary of Agriculture , both of whom were friends of the rectifiers , to publish jointly a decision defining whisky in the light of evidence which had been presented . Thus ended the first attempt to violate the Food Law by a complete triumph of the law itself . The Secretary was convicted but not convinced . The breach thus made was never closed . The Secretary was irrevocably allied with the foes of the food law . The decision of the Attorney-General was sent to the White House on April 10 , 1907 . President Roosevelt wrote a letter to Secretary Wilson in the following terms : " The White House , Washington , April 10 , 1907 . My Dear Mr. Secretary : In accordance with your suggestion , * I have submitted the matter concerning the proper labeling of whisky under the pure-food law to the Department of Justice . I inclose the Attorney-General 's opinion . I agree with this opinion and direct that action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be labeled as such . A mixture of two or more straight whiskies will be labeled Blended whisky ' or whiskies . ' A mixture of straight whisky and ethyl alcohol , provided that there is a sufficient amount of straight whisky to make it genuinely a mixture , ' will be labeled as a compound of , or compounded with , pure grain distillate . Imitation whisky will be labeled as such . Sincerely yours , ( Signed ) THEODORE ROOSEVELT . Hon. James Wilson , Secretary of Agriculture . " The full opinion of Attorney-General Bonaparte is ' printed as an appendix to Food Inspection Decision 65 ,  | sued April 12th , 1907 . The Attorney-General 's opinn is a blend of legal learning and charming sarcasm . hose who are interested in documents of this kind ill do well to read the opinion in full . As an illustration of the keen satire used by ttorney-General Bonaparte I quote the following osing paragraphs of his decision : " The following seem to me appropriate specimen brands or labels for ( 1 ) " straight " whisky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight " whiskies , ( 3 ) a mixture of " straight " whisky and ethyl alcohol , and ( 4 ) ethyl alcohol flavored and colored so as to taste , smell , and look like whisky : ( 1 ) Semper Idem Whisky : A pure , straight whisky mellowed by age . ( 2 ) E Pluribus Unum Whisky : A blend of pure , straight whiskies with all the merits of each . ( 3 ) Modern Improved Whisky : A compound of pure grain distillates , mellow and free from harmful impurities. ( 4 ) Something Better than Whisky : An imitation under the pure food law , free from fusel oil and other impurities . In the third definition it is assumed that both the whisky and the alcohol are distilled from grain . " It is hardly necessary to add that the rectifiers who d been engaged for many years under Government tense in the manufacture of compounded and imitaon whiskies failed to avail themselves of the method labeling suggested by the Attorney-General . After ving secured the support of Secretary Wilson for ntinuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumbfounded by their failure to have F. I. 45 repealed . They were still more greatly disturbed having F. I. D. 65 substituted in its place . They ere defeated and discouraged , but not eliminated .  | of Dr. John Uri Lloyd , who was not only a most eminent pharmaceutical chemist but a very personal friend of the Judge himself . We of course realized that the Judge 's opinion would not in any way be influenced by personal frienship , and this was particularly the case because some of the most prominent rectifiers of Cincinnati were also intimate friends of the Judge . While we were discussing these probabilities a messenger came from the Judge 's chambers with a note to the District Attorney asking that he be furnished with a copy of the brief of Dr. Wiley which had been offered in evidence in the court . We all felt that this was an important request , believing that if the Judge would read this report in full he would not be inclined to support the contention of the rectifiers . Our fondest hopes in this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three weeks subsequent to the trial , it was found to be a complete vindication of F. I. D. 45 and F. I. D. 65 . Not at all discouraged by their failure , the rectifiers appealed to other Federal Courts in other localities . Among these localities were Springfield , Illinois ; Covington , Kentucky ; Indianapolis , Indiana ; Buffalo , New York ; Baltimore , Maryland ; and San Francisco , California . In each case the opinions of the Court were entirely in harmony with the original opinion of Judge Thompson . Meanwhile the Bureau of Chennistry , shackled by the Board of Food and Drug Inspection , deemed it inadvisable to bring any cases against rectified spirits masquerading as whisky as long as the matter was still before the courts . It was known that finally the decision would have to be made by the courts anyway and any punitory steps might prove to be entirely futile . Mr. H. Parker Willis in an article published at this  | time made the following comment on this procedure under the heading , " The Public Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new regulations , and the cases brought under them , developed one particularly interesting fact in the situation : the distillers and rectifiers could not dispose of their goods for drinking , either as alcohol or as imitation whisky . ' The actual name whisky , ' without modification , was necessary to disposal of their product , notwithstanding that it was precisely the same article under another name . This was clearly brought out when the Western distilleries applied to Judge Van Fleet of the Northern District of California for an injunction restraining the marking of alcohol as ordered by the Bureau of Chemistry , alleging that they had been obliged to shut down their plant through inability to dispose of their product when marked alcohol . ' " Because of the hostile attitude of the courts , whisky manufacturers resolved to turn their attention in other directions . They had hoped to secure an easy victory through the judicial machinery of the Government ; but having been defeated there , and knowing that there was nothing to expect from Congress , they now turned again to the Executive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branded as imitation ' when it consisted of neutral spirits primarily , had gone into effect July 1 , 1908 , although prior to that date the distilling interests had accumulated as large stocks as possible under the old regulations for marking in order that they might continue to send out their goods as rye , ' Bourbon , ' or copper distilled ' whisky , instead of being compelled to use the term ' imitation . ' " Pressure upon the Roosevelt administration for action designed to relieve ' the rectifiers now became acute . Congressman Longworth , son-in-law of President Roosevelt , and friend of representatives of the Cincinnati distilling district , exerted himself in behalf of the rectifiers , and a simlar position was taken by numerous other members of Congress . Representative Perkins of New York , now chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the House and a historian of some reputation , had already devoted himself to  | securing a favorable ruling in the interest of Duffy 's Pure Malt Whisky . An interesting correspondence passed between Mr. Perkins and the Department of Agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of Secretary Wilson that the Duffy Malt Whisky Company * * * is controlled by our most prominent and leading citizens , and I trust matters can be adjusted in such a way as not to injure a long-established industry . ' Other statesmen wrote that the Duffy Company controlled considerable political influence . ' Not to be outdistanced in his efforts for the rectifying interests was Representative Sherman , now Vice-President . " During the winter a committee of rectifiers and spirit distillers , represented by A. J. Sunstein and others , visited Washingtqn , and sought to persuade the administration of the great harm that was , being done to the rectifying interests . The President finally harkened to the representations of the rectifiers , and appointed a Whisky Commission , ' consisting of Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson , Dr. F. L. Dunlap , Associate Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry , and John G. Capers , head of the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Treasury Department . Secretary Wilson and Commissioner Capers were already known as advocates of the views of the rectified whisky interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissent from the existing rulings of the Government . There was a good deal of mystery about this Commission . Although the Associated Press sent out a frank statement by President Roosevelt to the effect that such a Commission had been appointed , Seeretary Wilson took occasion to assure newspaper men that the Commission did not exist as such , and that the President had merely asked for a little advice . Commissioner Capers admitted the existence of the Commission , but Dr. Dunlap said nothing . " After several weeks of discussion and inquiry , the three advisers reported to the President in favor of allowing liquor made from neutral spirits to be designated as whisky . Mr. Sunstein and his committee had said that they would be satisfied if they could be allowed to brand their liquor  | as redistilled whisky , ' rectified whisky , ' or neutral whisky . ' The three commissioners , or conferees , now advised that some such plan be followed , telling the President that this was substantially the verdict that had been arrived at by the Royal Commission on Whisky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stated , had decided that any spirits made from grain was whisky . In a letter written on behalf of the Commission , Dr. Dunlap said , It is my opinion that the term whisky ' should not be denied to neutral spirits diluted with water to a proper strength and colored with caramel , ' though he recommended the use of some qualifying name , such as rectified whisky . ' The approval of President Roosevelt of AttorneyGeneral Bonaparte 's definitions of whisky created a curious environment in the Bureau of Chemistry . The Secretary of Agriculture , the associate chemist , Dr. Dunlap , the solicitor , Mr. George P. McCabe , together with the chief of the Bureau of Internal Revenue , Mr. John G. Capers , were all on the other side of the question . The President , Attorney-General Bonaparte , and the Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry were all agreed on the definitions . It was hard , however , to get Court action . AttorneyGeneral Bonaparte was very insistent that cases be brought in order to test the accuracy of his definitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , when a majority of the Board of Food and Drug lnspectiori would initial requests either for criminal action or seizure of goods .

We did bring a number of cases of seizure of goods ; that is , action in rem .

The decree of condemnation was in the same terms as those already reported . In his decision Judge Morris was particularly luminous . This was a jury trial . After the evi- dence had been given and the counsel for the defense had addressed the jury , Judge Morris said : " I will not call upon the counsel for the United States to reply . The case as it is presented to the jury is a very clear one . I reject the only prayer offered by the defense . Really , that prayer concedes the misbranding of the liquor , and asks me to say to the jury that if they shall find that this was done under the control and by the agents of the United States , the United States Ls estopped from proceeding to condemn these goods and forfeit the goods from misbranding .

In other words , the Secretary of Agriculture , under the law , was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been determined that the Bonaparte decision , which was the one which  | had been supported by all of these decisions , was soon to be revoked by the action of the United States itself , thus nullifying the Court 's decision to the effect that the Bonaparte opinion was wholly legal .

This also contains the same notice in regard to decision No. 113 as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Courts supporting the validity of the opinion of Attorney-General Bonaparte , and in not a single instance did any United States Court before which the matter was presented , nullify that decision . Nevertheless , in spite of all these Court decisions the opinion of the Attorney-General Bonaparte was revoked by executive authority and a diametrically different opinion supporting all the contentions of the rectifiers substituted in its place . Thereafter , no mention of any case against whisky is found in the Notices of Judgment . It was not necessary because the United States authorities , in plain violation of Court decisions , had decided that the Bonaparte opinion was all wrong . I never was able , even in the two years that intervened from the time of the decision of AttorneyGeneral Bonaparte to the close of the Roosevelt administration , to get the Board of Food and Drug Inspection  | to approve of any criminal case against any dealer who was an offender of the law . I have all the correspondence in which Attorney-General Bonaparte urged that his decision be taken before the Courts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sustained . In all the attempts of rectifiers to nullify his decision by bringing Court cases themselves , and this they did in eight separate cases , the rulings of the Court were always against them . To show the attitude of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection in this matter , I made determined efforts to bring a case against Duffy 's Pure Malt Whisky , either to seize the whisky or to bring a criminal action against the manufacturers . Every move in this direction was blocked by my collegues on the board . Under date of October 3rd , 1908 , the following note in regard to this matter was made : " Doctor Dunlap states that he initialed the first named seizure under a misapprehension , thinking that the Duffy Malt Whisky hearing was to be held here instead of in Buffalo , although it had been signed by the Secretary . I understood from Doctor Dunlap that the matter was held up by the Solicitor and that it would not be sent to the District Attorney until after the report of the hearing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of October 3 , he refused to initial the recommendation on the ground that it would not be proper to do so until the hearing of the Buffalo case had been received . I stated to him that the cases were entirely distinct , the Buffalo case being a criminal action recommended several weeks ago and the seizures are actions to be brought at the time mentioned , namely September 30 and October 3 , 1908 , and if not seized without delay the goods would escape . I stated that Duffy 's Malt Whisky was one of the most gigantic frauds of the age and a flagrant violation of the law , and that there was no necessity that we delay at all in the matter . He still , however , refused to initial . "  | This sufficiently illustrates the determined efforts of my colleagues to protect Duffy 's Pure Malt Whisky from being molested either by seizure or bringing any criminal case against the maker . The few cases that were brought against rectified whisky were at the direct request of the Attorney-General , followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the 3rd of October , 1907 , I addressed the Solicitor of the Department of Agriculture , as follows : " In a recent conversation with me the Attorney-General urged that cases be prepared as soon as possible in the whisky case . Fortunately , acting under the direction of the Secretary , we had already secured a great many cases . I have prepared three of these typical cases to be sent to the Attorney-General according to his request , with the least delay possible . They represent types of mixture which might well be seized under the law for a test case . The Attorney-General informed me that he believed Mr. Hough was trifling with him and it was not possible to secure any agreement and that he proposed to go ahead at once if such an agreement as dictated by him should not be acceptable . These cases are all ready for seizure and I urge that they be sent to the Attorney-General as requested without delay . " Following this , I cited to the Solicitor fifteen localities in the City of Washington where illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On November 6 , 1907 , the Attorney-General addressed a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture , in which he informed him that he had been unable to conk to any agreement on a statement of facts , and , therefore ? " it will be appropriate for you to proceed with the enforcement of the law relating to the subject of la beling whisky in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law . "  | I n the midst of these discussions the Secretary of Agriculture received a letter from John G. Capers , Commissioner of Internal Revenue , looking to a reopening of the questions decided by Attorney-General Bonaparte which it appears was due to the express desire of President Roosevelt . The letter dated Dec. 17 , 1907 , is as follows : " I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 13 , written following the conference between you , Mr. McCabe of your Department , and Assistant Secretary Winthrop and myself of this Department . In conformity with the suggestions made by you at that time and the suggestion made in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has referred the matter to the Attorney-General for an opinion upon the matter of labeling whisky , etc. , under the pure food law in its application to internal revenue laws , as well as to the Department of Agriculture as set out in his opinion approved by the President and addressed to you April 10 last . " This action by the Secretary is also taken in view of the expressed desire of the President in a communication addressed to the Secretary December 8 , that the matter be taken up by the Treasury Department . The Attorney-General has been requested to render an opinion as early as possible . " I referred to this movement on the part of the President in a letter which I wrote to Dr. James H. Shepard of Brookings , S. D. , Jan. 4 , 1908 , which I quote : " I I can not tell you much about the present status of the whisky case except this : The rectifiers , through Senator Hopkins and other influential senators , made a proposal to the President that they would withdraw all suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be modified so as to suit their views , or in so far as this could be . I understand the President appointed a commission consisting of Commissioner Capers , the Secretary of Agriculture , and Dr. Dunlap , to make the necessary revision of  | the regulations . In so far as I know the revision is to be made on a brief submitted by the rectifiers . I do not think that anyone who is in favor of maintaining the present regulations requiring imitation and compound whiskies to be so marked has been invited to appear before the Commission . Commissioner Capers has said in at least two printed interviews that he was going as far as he could to meet the requests of the rectifiers , even if possible to open up the question of like substances . I do n't know what attitude either the Secretary or Dr. Dunlap will take in this matter but I would like to wager you a peanut that I could guess . " President Roosevelt communicated to AttorneyGeneral Bonaparte the protests that had been made against his decision , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1907 , Attorney-General Bonaparte filed with the President his reasons for not re-opening the case in which he made the following statements : The President , The White House . SIR : In accordance with your instructions , I gave a hearing on Wednesday , May 15 , to persons desiring to submit to the Department criticism or other comment on my opinion of April 10 last past , as to the construction of section 8 of the act approved June 30 , 1906 , and generally known as the Pure-Food Law . About thirty persons appeared on this occasion and a number of oral arguments were presented ; some critical and some approbatory of the opinion in question . At the conclusion of this argument I announced my willingness to receive and consider any matters in writing which might be submitted to me touching its subject-matter , and , . in response to several requests for a further hearing , stated that I would give these requests due consideration and announce later whether I saw any sufficient reason to comply with them . As heretofore stated to you verbally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another oral argument , and , with your approval , I have , therefore , announced that , in this respect ,  | the matter must be considered closed . I received a large number of written communications from various persoxls commenting on the opinion in question , and I have carefully considered all of them . I find no reason to withdraw the said opinion , or to modify it in any respect , and I respectfully report that , in my judgment , this opinion correctly states the law on the subject to which it relates . " ( Signed ) Charles J. Bonaparte . Attorney-General Bonaparte issued three short state papers on the subject " What is Whisky ? " The first of these papers bears the date April 10 , 1907 . In this paper the question of what is whisky was answered in harmony with the provisions of the food and drugs act . The points covered in this paper were so distasteful to the rectifying interests as to call for numerous requests for rehearing . The Attorney-General granted them a rehearing . On May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he stated that he found no reason to modify in any respect the opinion of April 10th . Toward the close of the Roosevelt Administration , the rectifiers made a last desperate effort to have the Attorney-General 's opinion changed . This has been thoroughly set out in the quotations from the article of H. Parker Willis . The new effort was evidently inaugurated by the President who often referred to Dr. Dunlap , Associate Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry , as " my chemist . " In the light of Dr. Dunlap 's career in the Bureau no one will likely dispute Roosevelt 's often repeated claim to proprietorship . The Committee having in charge this matter was thoroughly devoted to the rectifying interests . It is only natural therefore that the report they brought in , which was written by Dr. Dunlap , would be favorable thereto . The gist of Dr. Dunlap 's report is as follows :  | " Under the Pure Food Law as administered now , neutral spirits , diluted to proper strength and colored with caramel , must be marked imitation whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forced upon them , but that they may use in its place one of the three names , ' neutral whisky , " rectified whisky , ' or ' redistilled whisky . ' * * * It is my opinion that the term ' whisky ' should not be denied to neutral spirits diluted with water to a proper strength and colored with caramel . I believe that the use of the term ' whisky ' on such a product should be qualified by some term which will carry notice to the consumer of the nature of the product . For this purpose the term ' neutral whisky , ' ' redistilled whisky , ' and ' rectified whisky , ' have been suggested . " Mr. Bonaparte proceeds to comment on this suggestion of Dr. Dunlap 's with rare sarcasm for which he was distinguished . He says : " It seems obvious , from the juxtaposition of these extracts from my two opinions and those from Dr. Dunlap 's letter , that the Associate Chemist of the Department of Agriculture suggests that , on the question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconsidered opinion of the Attorney-General should be disregarded . He bases this recommendation upon certain conclusions which he says have been reached by the English ' Royal Commission on whisky and other potable spirits , ' in what is described as an ' interim report . ' " He describes this Commission as composed of ' eminent scientific men , ' but it does not appear from his letter that the said Commission consists of lawyers , or that they have had under consideration the construction of the Act of Congress generally known as the Pure Food Law . I am , therefore , unable to recognize their conclusions as entitled to weight in determining the above mentioned question of statutory construction , and I may add that I am unable to see how these conclusions , in so far as stated by Dr. Dunlap , have any bearing upon the question considered in my two opinions . " It appears to me that these ' eminent scientific men , ' in these conclusions , made suggestions as to what legislation  | on the subject should contain . They do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not express any opinions as to the construction of an American law dealing with American conditions . " Inasmuch , however , as I can not fail to recognize in Dr. Dunlap 's recommendation a challenge of the correctness of my conclusions as announced in the two opinions heretofore rendered you , I think it is but proper that I should call your attention to certain judicial decisions rendered upon the questions discussed in his letter subsequently to the date of the said two opinions . In the case of Levy vs . Uri , the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia , speaking by Mr. Justice Robb , says on this question : Each kind of whisky mentioned has its own peculiar flavor and character and is sought after as a beverage because of that flavor and character . Neutral spirits , on the contrary , as the term suggests , is a colorless liquid , has neither flavor nor character , and is not a beverage at all . It may be produced from any fermented substance , such as corn , potatoes , and sugar beets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with the advent of cheaper methods of production it has been palmed of on the public as a beverage by mixing it with something to give it flavor and character . Since it costs far less to produce than rye whisky , it is apparent that its use by the distiller increases his profits in proportion as the public is deceived . * * As before stated , neutral spirits is not a beverage , has none of the distinguishing characteristics of rye whisky , and is , therefore , matter of another kind . " Mr. Bonaparte then proceeds to quote the decision of Judge Thompson of the Southern District of Ohio and also the opinion of the District Court of the Southern District of Illinois , and refers to other Court decisions in which his definitions of whisky had been unanimously supported . He then says : " It thus appears that the correctness of the conclusions reached by this Department in the two opinions to which I have referred has been tested in at least four decisions by competent courts upon the precise question discussed in Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance has been that what he advises is forbidden by the true construction of the Pure Food Law . So far as I am aware , there has been no decision by any court to the contrary . * * * At present , however , in so far as informed by the decisions heretofore made on this question , I can only advise you that the conclusions announced in the opinions of April 10th and May 29th , 1907 , are sound , and that to give effect to Dr. Dunlap 's suggestions would be to violate the Pure Food Law . " The action of President Roosevelt in again sustaining the Attorney-General received universal press support . Mr. Louis Ludlow , then President of the National Press Club and now member of Congress elect . described the event in the Indianapolis Star under date of February 23rd , 1909 . He says : " The President indorses and makes public an order of Attorney-General Bonaparte , which declares the position of the rectifiers and the conclusions of the commission to be in error . Dr. Wiley 's views on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under date of Feb. 24 , 1909 , is an editorial , " A Victory for Wiley , " from which I quote the following : " For the third time Attorney-General Bonaparte has decided that neutral spirits diluted with water to a proper strength and colored with caramel is not whisky , but imitation whisky ' and must be labeled as such . This was the ruling of Dr. Wiley. * * * It is evident that the authorities have no intention of weakening the Pure Food Law any further at the present time . The benzoate of soda ruling is enough for the present time . It is realized , of course , that there will always be pressure to have the law construed favorably to those who want to evade it . Probably it will gradually be much weakened . One concession will be made , and then another . The people will be less watchful , and at last we may find that we have virtually no law at all . " This prophetic disaster has long since been realized .  | In view of the positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first it was thought that this investigation was not at his suggestion . A letter written by H. Parker Willis , published in Collier 's Weekly of April 6 , 1912 , throws additional light upon this matter . Mr. Willis says in his letter : " Secretary Wilson was now in a position of peculiar strength . He had full charge of the Food and ' Drugs Act ; he understood the precedents that had been established during the past four years ; the matter had been referred to the Department of Justice by his own assent ; he had nothing to do but apply the law vigorously . But it was well known that neither he nor his Solicitor approved the decision in the whisky case . The politicians were more and more active . Mr. Perkins of New York brought strenuous pressure to bear upon the Department of Agriculture in behalf of Duffy 's Pure Malt Whisky , which would have to be labeled imitation ' under the new rules . He was strongly seconded by Vice President Sherman . President Roosevelt finally designated Secretary Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the head of the Bureau of Internal Revenue , as a Whisky Commission . Secretary Wit . son was thus given full power to shape the decision as he pleased . A report from him would have settled the situation once for all . No such report was forthcoming . Secretary Wilson even denied in conversation that any such commission existed , and finally the three men rendered a report in favor of allowing liquor made from alcohol to be branded as rectified whisky , ' thus giving the use of the word whisky to the interests that had been demanding it . " There is no longer any doubt that the new committee to inquire into the accuracy of the opinions of Attorney . General Bonaparte was appointed by the President . Dr. Dunlap , in submitting the report of this committee under date of February 19 , 1909 , says :  | " In accordance with the request of the President , I have continued the consideration of the labeling propositions submitted to him by the spirit distillers . " The Secretary of Agriculture in a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Senate of New York , under date of December 17 , 1908 , says : " Pursuant to my conversation with you of yesterday in regard to a proposed hearing on the 21st instant concerning ' Duffy 's Pure Malt Whisky , ' I beg to inform you that this hearing will be postponed pending the report of the gentlemen appointed by the President to take up questions in connection with the labeling of products such as you manufacture . " On December 13 , four days prior to the writing of this letter by the Secretary of Agriculture , the Washington Post carried this editorial under the caption " Keep the Ginger in the Pure Food Law ! " " It is good to read a direct denial of the report that the President has reopened the whole subject of what is whisky . The story was that he has selected the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and one of the officers of the Agricultural Department to take up the existing regulations and revise them with the Secretary of Agriculture . * * * " Above everything , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * At the instance of Dr. Wiley that query has been answered with a loud ' NO . ' Any other answer would have jeopardized the whole * * * regulations governing compounded ' and imitation ' whisky . To the outsider those regulations would seem to be already sufficiently considerate . " A few days before the Washington Post had carried the story of the appointment of the above commission . I t printed another news story as follows : " The uncertainty caused some of the large distilleries of the country to present the matter to the President to-day . They were introduced to him by Senator Hopkins and Representative Graff , of Illinois . Secretary Wilson and Mr. Capers were present . "  | Although the President repudiated the report of his own commission and again sustained the opinion of Attorney-General Bonaparte , the activities of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection in protecting the interests of Duff y 's Malt Whisky and Canadian Club Whisky were continued right along just as if nothing had happened . On June 12 , 1908 , after a large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officials of the pure-food law , the following order was issued : " By direction of the Secretary , no more seizures of imported whiskys are to be made until further orders . There have been twenty-one cases reported and , in the Secretary 's opinion , that number is sufficient for the present . Please cause the necessary instructions to be sent to the Inspectors . Very respectfully , ( Signed ) G. P. McCabe , Acting Chairman , Board of Food and Drug Inspection . " The reason for suspension of seizures is probably the following incident which occured at the hearing accorded Duffy 's Malt Whisky representative . I quote from this hearing : " Senator Armstrong urged that the Bill of Libel against carloads of goods shipped to Boston be dismissed , stating that the Company had stopped shipment . Dr. Wiley suggested that if they would stop interstate shipments of this material , it would be very proper to grant them additional time until after election . Mr. Perkins , Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Duffy raised vigorous objections , stating that the firm had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in advertising , had built up a trade , and that it ought not to be interfered with . " Following this hearing came the order of suspension of further seizures . These official data show that the President appointed this commission , that the commission considered the  | hubjects referred to it , that it made its report through Dr. Dunlap on the 19th of February , 1909 , and that the Attorney-General most decidedly and emphatically repudiated the findings of this commission and the President thereupon approved the Attorney-General 's report . An unconfirmed rumor current at the time was to the effect that Bonaparte told the President that he would immediately resign if his report did not again receive approval . Mr. H. Parker Willis says : " Attorney-General Bonaparte was now in an embarrassing position . He had already rendered his opinion with reference to the nature of whisky , and the proper methods of branding it under the existing law of the United States . President Roosevelt had sent Mr. Bonaparte the report of the Whisky Commission , which had just been transmitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . " Two questions presented themselves to Mr. Bonaparte ? whether he should reverse himself and accept the findings of Messrs . Wilson , Capers , and Dunlap , or whether he should stand neutral and idle , in case President Roosevelt should see fit to put into effect his Commission 's recommendations . Mr. Bonaparte decided both of these points negatively . In a rather scathing letter to President Roosevelt , he pointed out that the Whisky Commission had based its suggestions almost entirely upon work that had been done in England by a body not known to American law , ? the British Royal Commission , ? while he had found it his duty to guide himself by the laws of the United States . He could not , therefore , as a matter of law , consent to the proposal now made . Noting that the assistant chemist of the Department of Agriculture suggests that on the question of the construction of a statute ( the Pure Food Law ) a very  | carefully considered and reconsidered opinion of the Attorney-General should be disregarded , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize in Dr. Dunlap 's recommendation a challenge of the correctness of ' his conclusions . He therefore called attention to the interpretations of the Food Law , in line with the views of the Department of Justice that had lately been handed down by the courts . It was stated by officers of the Government that he had privately conveyed to the President the intimation that although only about a week remained before his termination of office as Attorney-General , he should feel compelled to resign , in the event that the President saw fit to overrule his decision in the whisky matter . The President had been largely animated by his own sense of fair play in giving the rectifiers every opportunity to set forth their ideas ; and he now made his own stand evident by approving Mr. Bonaparte 's views , and continuing the existing methods of marking and branding liquors . " In the Washington Herald of Feb. 27 , 1909 , is an editorial from which I quote : Our good right hand , palm up , to Mr. Charles Joseph Bonaparte in warm congratulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisky , ' says the AttorneyGeneral ; and so sayeth his Chief , the President of the United States ! * * * " We regard this as a great victory for the common people , and we trust they appreciate fully its momentous significance . Heretofore every old thing that could assume the most remote whisky-like disguise has labeled itself whisky , and posed in the open market as the real , genuine , simonpure article . * * * " Mr. Bonaparte need not fear that it is not the people 's tremendous applause he hears ringing in his ears ! It is just that very thing . Pat with him they stand . Whisky is whisky , and nothing else is whisky . ' " If the rectifiers had only been endowed with prophetic vision , they would not have made a continuous  | fight for two long years against the Attorney-General and the President and the Food Law . They would not have commenced numerous actions in Federal Courts , all of which they lost with monotonous regularity . They would not have spent hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others of the same character as mentioned in the article by H. Parker Willis . They would simply have waited . This final rebuff by President Roosevelt occurred on the 19th of February , 1909 , thirteen days before the advent of the new administration . On the morning of the 5th of March the storm clouds which had darkened the sky of the rectifiers for two long weary years broke asunder . The rays of victory shot through the rift , and the full sunlight of triumph shone forth . The principles which had guided the Roosevelt administration were eternal and just . The law was not altered , but its interpretation was radically changed in the interest of the rectifiers of whisky and other alcoholic distilled beverages When the last of these cases was finally decided in the District Courts , President Taft came into the White House . A very remarkable event is now to be recorded . He ordered a rehearing of the whisky problem . A classmate of President Taft , Mr. Lloyd Bowers , had been made Solicitor of the Department of Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hearings on whisky . This was equivalent to instructing the jury to bring in a verdict . Owing to the protests of the straight whisky interests President Taft finally appointed his Solicitor-General , Lloyd Bowers , to hold these hearings . They have been printed under the title " Proceedings Before and By Direction  | of the President Concerning the Meaning of Whisky . " They cover 1328 printed pages . Following is the order of the President constituting this tribunal : In the Office of the Solicitor-General , Thursday , April 8 , 1909 . These proceeding are had pursuant to an order of the President of the United States , reading as follows : A number of distillers and importers of spirits and whisky , represented by Lawrence Maxwell , Esq. , Hon. Joseph H. Choate , Alfred Lucking , Warwick M. Hough , and Hon. W. W. Armstrong , having appealed to the President for a hearing with respect to the order issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue , known as Order No. 723 , pursuant to the rules and regulations for the enforcement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 , promulgated and made by the Secretary of Agriculture under date of May 14 , 1908 , claiming that the provisions of said order are in violation of the terms of the said act in that they require to be branded as imitations or compounds , or otherwise , whiskies which have well-settled names in the trade , and which it was not the intention of Congress by the said food and drugs act to require to be described by any other designation ; and certain distillers of whisky having appeared by Edmund W. Taylor and the Hon. John G. Carlisle , after consideration the matter is hereby referred to Hon. Lloyd W. Bowers , Solicitor-General of the United States , to take testimony and report to the President his opinion upon the following points , namely : What was the article called whisky as known ( 1 ) to the manufacturers , ( 2 ) to the trade , and ( 3 ) to the consumers at and prior to the date of the passage of the pure food law f What did the term whisky include ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of congeneric substances as necessary in order that distilled spirits should be properly designated whisky ? Was there any abuse in the application of the term whisky to articles not properly falling within the definition of that term at and prior to the passage of the pure food law , which it was the intention of Congress to correct by the provisions of that act ? Is the term whisky as a drug applicable to a different product than whisky as a beverage ? If so , in what par-ticulars ? The Solicitor-General will from time to time determine the extent and character of the hearing and will report with his opinion the evidence taken by him pursuant hereto . ( No. 1061 , Apr. 8 , 1909 . ) ( Signed ) WM . H. TAFT . Quoting further from the article by H. Parker Willis : " When President Taft entered the White House , on the 4th of March , 1909 , the rectifying interests were by no means inclined to let the whisky question rest . They knew that , while Secretary of War , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the subject had originally come up before the Cabinet for settlement . It was determined to make a fresh and vigorous effort to secure a reversal of the Roosevelt rulings that would permit the rectifiers to continue placing their neutral spirits on the market under the name of whisky . Consequently , shortly after the President took office , he was approached by all the original interests that had urged a change in the methods of marking whisky and , yielding to their pressure , he consented to reopen the question and to hear argument in person . " Early in April a distinguished array of counsel appeared at the White House . Straight whisky interests had employed ex-Secretary John G. Carlisle to eodperate with Edmund W. Taylor , the original representative of the straight whisky distilleries , while for the rectifying interests appeared Joseph H. Choate , former ambassador to  | England , Senator Armstrong of New York , Lawrence Maxwell , Esq. , and Warwick M. Hough , the high-priced lawyer who had been sent to Washington as a representative of rectified interests and of the wholesale liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadian Club whisky interests , which had found themselves hamppered by the rulings of the Government , and in whose interest the powerful offices of Ambassador James Bryce had been enlisted with President Roosevelt to secure the admission of the Canadian product without the imitation label . " President Taft listened to the arguments on both sides , and showed a strong disposition to refer the matter directly to Commissioner Capers , the head of the Bureau of Internal Revenue . Mr. Capers , however , had long been associated with the work of the Bureau of Internal Revenue under the old regulations which permitted the marking of rectified spirits as whisky ; and he was known to be favorable to the retention of the old system of markings , having shown this feeling when , in conjunction with Secretary Wilson and Dr. Dunlap , he had recommended the ehunges demanded by the rectifying and blending interests . The ' resident 's disposition to throw the question back into adverse hands at once called forth a protest from the straight whisky men , based upon the ground that Mr. Capers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the justice of this claim , directed Solicitor-General Bowers to serve in place of Mr. Capers . " The points that Mr. Bowers was to take up included an inquiry as to the true definition of the term whisky ' at the time of the passage of the Pure Food Law , and an inquiry into the chemical constituents whose presence necessarily designated a liquor as being unmistakably whisky . He was further called upon to determine whether , as urged by the ' Duffy 's Pure Malt Whisky ' interests , whisky as a drug was a different product from whisky as a beverage . The old controversy burst forth afresh , and , beginning April 8 , ( 1909 ) , Mr. Bowers conducted almost continuous hearings , lasting nearly a month . More than twelve hundred pages of printed testimony were taken . At times the room in which the meetings were held resembled a chemical labora- tory more than it did a courtroom , while at others , as the witnesses sat about a table , freely tasting the various samples that had been submitted for examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the completion of the testimony and the arguments of the attorneys the Solicitor-General made his report to the President on May 24 , 1909 . This report is found in the Whisky hearing above referred to beginning on page 1243 . Mr. Bowers ' opinion , summarized is as follows : " 1 . 1 . A neutral spirit derived by distillation from anything else than grain has not been known to the consumer as whisky , whether or not it was colored or flavored or both colored and flavored ; and a neutral spirit derived by dis tillation from grain , but lacking a substantial amount of by-products ( other than alcohol ) which are derived by distillation from grain and give distinctive flavor and properties , has not been known to the consumer as whisky , . whether or not it was colored or flavored or both colored and flavored. 2 . A neutral spirit derived by distillation from grain , but lacking a substantial amount of by-products derived by distillation from grain and giving distinctive flavor and properties , was not at or prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since been , whisky . 3 . There was included in the term whisky a minimum of congeneric substances as necessary in order that the distilled spirit should be properly designated as whisky , viz. , such substantial amount of those congeneric substances as is requisite to give to whisky distinctive flavor and properties , differing from the flavor and properties of alcohol and of other distilled spirits . There was no maximum of such congeneric substances , however , except as potability might demand . 4 . There were many abuses in the trade . The evidence , however , has not been such as to make possible , or to justify an attempt at , enumeration of the particular abuses , beyond saying that they included the application of the term ' whisky ' to spirits distilled from other substances than grain , or to ? mixtures of such spirits with whisky , or to neu- tral spirits derived from grain but not whisky within the description of it given in answer to question II , or to such mixtures of neutral spirits and whisky as do not fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II . 5 . The term whisky as a drug is not applicable to a different product than whisky as a beverage . " On page 404 of my brief on whisky ( unprinted ) I draw the following conclusions : " FIRST : The principle enunciated in Food Inspection Decision No. 45 is correct , and no modification of this decision should be made . " SECOND : When Neutral spirits are diluted with water and artificially colored and flavored , the resulting product should not be called whisky . Under the ruling of the Internal Revenue such a product may be called imitation whisky if not sold as a genuine whisky , or spurious if it be sold as a genuine whisky . " THIRD : If whisky be mixed with neutral spirits and colored and flavored , it forms that well-known class of bodies called compounds , and should be marked Compound of whisky and neutral spirits ' or some similar appellation . " FOURTH : If two or more whiskies be mixed together , the resulting mixture should be marked blend , " A mixture of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no public decision ever issued received such unanimous condemnation as Bowers ' report . Everybody was dissatisfied . Warwick M. Hough and Lawrence Maxwell objected to it because it denied to neutral spirit the name of whisky . Joseph H. Choate and Alfred Lucking objected on behalf of Canadian Club whiskies for the same reasons . John G. Carlisle and Edmund W. Taylor objected on behalf of the straight whisky producers because it permitted the addition of alcohol to whisky provided the congeners which gave the whisky its character were not too greatly diluted . Wm . W. Armstrong objected to it on behalf  | of Duffy 's Malt Whisky . J. D. Rouse objected to it because it denied alcohol made from molasses to be called whisky . The Columbus Distilling Company objected to it for the same reason . The Michigan Chemical Company objected to it because alcohol to be mixed with other whisky must be made out of grain . All appealed to the President of the United States for help . The President appointed a hearing which was held in the Executive Mansion on June 28 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , presiding ; Hon. George W. Wickersham , Attorney-General of the United States ; Hon. James Wilson , Secretary of Agriculture ; Mr. Warwick M. Hough , Mr. Lawrence Maxwell , Mr. Joseph H. Choate , Hon. John G.

THE PRESIDENT : We are here this morning to hear the exceptions to a report , and I believe that the report has the first indication of correctness in that there are exceptions from every side . MR . CARLISLE : Nobody satisfied . THE PRESIDENT : Nobody satisfied . President Taft , after considering the protests made by the rectifiers in the decision of the Solicitor-General on the whisky question , disapproved the most important of these findings of his own Solicitor-General and adopted in toto many of the principles presented to him , by the rectifiers . However , he suggested a method of labelling which was in some respects distasteful to the rectifiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HONORABLE LLOYD BOWERS " It is undoubtedly true that the liquor trade has been disgracefully full of frauds upon the public by false labels ;  | but these frauds did not consist in palming off something hich was not whisky as whisky , but in palming one kind ? f whisky as another and better kind of whisky . Whisky ade of rectified or redistilled or neutral spirits and given color and flavor by burnt sugar , made in a few days , was often branded as Bourbon or Rye straight whisky . The ay to remedy this evil is not to attempt to change the eaning and scope of the term whisky , ' accorded to it for ? ne hundred years , and narrow it to include only straight whisky ; and there is nothing in the Pure Food Law that arrants the inference of such an intention by Congress . he way to do it is to require a branding in connection with e use of the term whisky ' which will indicate just what hid of whisky the package contains . Thus , straight hiskies may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend ' aged in wood . ' Whisky made from rectified , distilled , or neutral spirits may be branded as whisky ade from rectified , redistilled , or neutral spirits , as the awe may be . " With this result , the question arises what ought the rder to be so that the purpose of the Pure Food Law can . carried out . The term ' straight whisky ' is well underood in the trade and well understood by consumers . There no reason , therefore , why those who make straight whisky ? ay not have the brand upon their barrels of straight whisky with further descriptive terms as ' Bourbon ' or ' Rye ' whisky , as the composition of the grain used may justify , d they may properly add , if they choose , that it is aged the wood .

" ( Signed ) WILLIAM H. TAFT . The White House , December 27 , 1909 . President Taft in revising the opinion of his Solicitor-General that neutral spirits or alcohol , even when carrying flavor , were not entitled to be defined as whisky , also revised the opinion of his distinguished father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 21st of August , 1876 , as follows : " I agree with my predecessor 's opinion that the shipment of alcohol under the name of whisky ( the offense charged ) , is a violation of section 3449 , Revised Statutes , notwithstanding the trade , ' generally may have fallen into such a practice . Alcohol and whisky are , unquestionably , different articles , in contemplation of law , as they are in fact , having different qualities and different values . It appears , also , that they are placed by common carriers under different rates in their freighting schedules ; * * ? " When the act prescribes how spirits may be stored or bonded , it must be presumed that it means spirits that have been lawfully distilled . " This being patent , it is obviously important that there should be an absolute agreement in character of all the acts which together go to make up the act of shipping ; and I must believe that the law intends to secure this . * * ? This would be difficult or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were permitted to use one name for another , at their pleasure , or for any purpose . " Very respectfully , ( Signed ) Alphonso Taft , Attorney-General .  | ec ordingly the three Secretaries , who under the authority of the law were empowered to make rules d regulations for carrying the law into effect , preared the definitions which did not , however , follow resident Taft 's directions above . Food Inspection Decision No. 113 is as follows : " Under the Food and Drugs Act of June 30 , .1906 , all iinm , ixed distilled spirits from grain , colored and flavored with harmless color and flavor , in the customary ways , either by the charred barrel process , or by the addition of caramel and harmless flavor , if of potable strength and not less than 80 ? proof , are entitled to the name whisky without qualification. * If the proof be less than 80 ? , i.e. , if more water be added , the actual proof must be stated upon the label and this requirement applies as well to blends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or different kinds , i.e. , straight whisky , rectified whisky , redistilled whisky and neutral spirits whisky are like substances* and mixtures of such whiskies , with or without harmless color or flavor used for purposes of coloring and flavoring only , are blends under the law and must be so labeled . In labeling blends the Act requires two things to be stated upon the label to bring the blended product within the exception provided by the statute : First , the blend must be labeled , branded or tagged so as to plainly indicate that it is a blend , in other words that it is composed of two or more like substances , which in the case of whisky must each be of itself a whisky , and Second , the word blend ' must be plainly stated upon the package in which the mixture is offered for sale . A mixture of whiskies , therefore , with or without harmless coloring or flavoring , used for coloring and flavoring only , is correctly labeled Kerwan Whisky . A Blend of Whiskies . ' * " Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distillates from other sources are unlike substances to distillates from grain , such distillates from other sources without admixture with grain distillates are misbranded if labeled whisky without qualification , or as a " All three of these statements are not in harmony with Taft 's decision .  | blend of whiskies . However , mixtures of whisky , with a potable alcoholic distillate from sources other than grain , such as cane , fruit or vegetables , are not misbranded if labeled compound whisky , provided the following requirements of the law are complied with : First , that the product shall be labeled , branded or tagged so as to plainly indicate that it is a compound , i.e. , not a mixture of like substances , in this case whiskies ; and , Second , that the word Compound ' is plainly stated upon the package in which the mixture is offered for sale . For example , a mixture of whisky , in quantity sufficient to dominate the character of the mixture , with a potable alcoholic distillate from sources other than grain and including harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound of whisky and cane distillate . ' Unmixed potable alcoholic distillates from sources other than grain and including harmless color or flavor , are not misbranded if labeled Imitation Whisky . ' " When an essence or oil is added to a distillate of grain . which without such addition is entitled to the name whisky , and the effect of such addition is to produce a product which simulates a whisky of another kind different from the kind of whisky to which the essence is added , the mixture is an imitation of the particular kind of whisky which is simulated , e.g. , if rye essence be added to a highly rectified die . tillate of corn , the mixture is misbranded if labeled rye whisky . Such a mixture is not misbranded if labeled Whisky ? Imitation Rye . ' " Nothing in the Food and Drugs Act inhibits any truthful statement upon the label of any product subject to its terms , such as the particular kind or kinds of whisky , vended as whisky or as blends or compounds thereof , but when descriptive matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label , it must be strictly true , and not leading in any particular . The law makes no allowance for seller 's praise upon the label , if false or misleading , and the product is misbranded if a false or misleading statement be made upon one part of the label and the truth about the product be stated upon another part . Similarly a product is misbranded if the label is false or misleading through the use of a trade-marked statement , design or device . The fact that a phrase , design or device is registered in the U. S.  | Patent Office gives no license for its deceptive use . All descriptive matter qualifying or particularizing the kind of whisky , whether volunteered or required by the law to be stated , as in the case of blends and compounds , must be given due prominence as compared with the size of type and the background in which the name whisky appears , so that the label as a whole shall not be misleading in any particular .

" This decision directly contrary to the findings of many Federal Courts , promulgated by the three Secretaries charged with the duty of making rules and regulations for carrying the law into effect , is the most astonishing exhibition of illegality ever perpetrated . No higher flight of open contempt of judicial findings has ever been made by any one whose duty it is to follow the courts ' decisions . It would have been bad enough as an attempt at construing the meaning of a law prior to judicial opinions . In the face of the facts It is a flagrant contempt of Court . The regulations made by the three Secretaries are most remarkable . In the first place they attempt to decide what is an adulteration or misbranding , a function which was never committed to them but was specifically given to the Bureau of Chemistry . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of branding laid down by President Taft in the above extract from his letter . There is absolutely no trace in this decision of requir- ing whisky to be labeled neutral spirit whisky , or a blend of that whisky and a whisky made from neutral spirits . Those were the fundamental principles which President Taft laid down for correct labeling . These two phrases were highly objectionable to the rectifiers . Under the very nose of the President the rectifiers so controlled the action of the three Secretaries that neither one of these phrases was incorporated into the necessary labeling of whiskies made from neutral spirits . Not only was every decision of the courts violated by this order , but President Taft 's specific directions for labeling were also disregarded . It is very strange that the President himself did not make a protest against the utter disregard of the fundamental principles upon which his labeling order was based . On publication of this food inspection decision in which the rectifiers gained everything they had lost in the decisions of the Federal Courts , their petitions of appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By executive proclamation they had obtained what the courts had denied them . All the interests which were engaged in adulterating and misbranding foods were greatly heartened by this victory of the rectifiers . If one class of misbranders and adulterators could receive immunity by executive order , why not apply the same principle to all forms of adulteration and misbranding ? I am very strongly of the opinion that this approval of neutral spirits colored and flavored as whisky and this , of course , would apply to gin and rum , and all other distilled spirits , including brandy , and by ha .  | lication also , to adulterated and misbranded beer and me , was one of the principal causes which enabled the octrine of prohibition to achieve such a sweeping vicry a few years afterward under the stress of promoting the public welfare during the period of the world war . At least in so far as I was concerned I had spent many years of hard labor in trying to have M all kinds of distilled spirits as well as fermented beverages comply with ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swelling floods of adulterations and misbranding of our beverages were broken down and waves of food adulterations swept over and devastated the country . On the morning after the President issued his proclamation Mr. Lloyd Bowers called me over the telephone . He said : " Have you read the President 's decision ? " I said , " I have , with great astonishment . " Ile asked , " What do you think about it ? " I replied , " I feel as if I had been spanked , " to which he replied , " So do I. " This was the last time I heard Lloyd Bowers ' voice . The next morning the newspapers carried the notice that the Solicitor-General had left Washington for a few weeks ' rest . About three weeks after that I saw , with great regret , a notice of his death . Thus passed a great lawyer and a great jurist . I think I was right in thinking that probably his premature death was due to a broken heart . Nobody was satisfied with the laborious effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy was with Lloyd Bowers . I was impressed with the conviction that he was earnestly seeking the truth . Three-fourths of his decision was in harmony with my own views , so that I believe that he was at least three-fourths right .  | On the evening after the President 's decision was published Mr. Charles H. Butler , reporter of the Supreme Court , entertained the Supreme Court at his residence , 1535 Eye St. , N. W. I was one of the invited guests at this function . Among other members of the Supreme Court who were there was Justice Harlan of Kentucky . Accosting me he said , " Come over here , my boy , where there are not so many people . I would like to talk to you . " Retiring to a secluded spot somewhat distant from the punch bowl we sat down upon a sofa . Justice Harlan said to me , " What is this I hear about holding Supreme Court in the White House ? " I replied , " You know as much about it as I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To which he replied , " Things are coming to a pretty pass in this country . The question of What is whisky ? ' was on its way to my Court and now it will never reach there . " What a pathetic void in classic Supreme Court decisions was caused when Justice Harlan was denied this opportunity of writing . the opinion of the Supreme Court on this case ! Fortunately the rectifiers did not have many years to enjoy the fruits of their great victory . The enactment of the Prohibition Amendment and the Volstead Act placed all dealings in beverage alcoholic drinks outside of the law . The question now is not " What is whisky ? " but " Where is whisky ? " The adulterations of the bootleg brand are now more deadly than were the combinations of the rectifiers in the old days . These illegal decisions that permit alcohol to masquerade as whisky have never been repealed . They remain sonorous witnesses of the triumph of the unholy .  | All of these disasters would have been prevented if the food law had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most amazing events in the recital I have . just made is to see the three Secretaries who were authorized to make rules and regulations for carrying out the food law attaching their signatures to a decision which clearly prevented the law from being enforced . This misconception of the law has continued until the present day and has been the cause of all the crimes committed against it .  | " It has often been said that , to make discoveries , one must be ignorant . This opinion , mistaken in itself , nevertheless conceals a truth . It means that it is better to know nothing than to keep in mind fixed ideas based on theories whose confirmation we constantly seek , neglecting meanwhile everything that fails to agree with them . " Men who have excessive faith in their theories or ideas are not only ill prepared for making discoveries ; they also make very poor observations . Of necessity they observe with a preconceived idea , and when they devise an experiment , they can see , in its results , only a confirmation of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect very important facts because they do not further their aim . This is what made us say elsewhere that we must never make experiments to confirm our ideas , but simply to control them ; which means , in other terms , that one must accept the results of experiments as they come , with all their unexpectedness and irregularity . " But it happens further quite naturally that men who believe too firmly in their theories , do not believe enough in the theories of others . So the dominant idea of these despisers of their fellows is to find others ' theories faulty and to try to contradict them . The difficulty , for science , is still the same . They make experiments only to destroy a theory , instead of to seek the truth . At the same time , they make poor observations , because they choose among the results of their experiments only what suits their object , neglecting whatever is unrelated to it , and carefully setting  | aside everything which might tend toward the idea they wish to combat . By these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same result , that is , to falsify science and the facts . " From Experimental Medicine , by Claude Bernard , pages 87 and 38 . I n the enactment of the Food Law the Congress plainly provided the mechanism of its enforcement . There was no provision in the law for any additional machinery . It was evident that the Bureau of Chemistry was the dominant factor in bringing offenders of t law before the Courts . Those who " felt the halter draw " had " no good opinion of the law " as the poet has pertinently and wittily said . The elimination of the Bureau was therefore the thing of prime importance . The President of the United States seems to have taken the initiative in this matter . President Roosevelt wrote to the various universities to secure a chemist , not to replace me , but to be placed in such a position as to counteract all my activities . Accordingly on the recommendation of President Angell of Ann Arbor the President issued an order permitting Dr. Frederick L. Dunlap to be appointed , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chemistry without being subject to the orders of the Chief of that Bureau , but reporting directly to the Secretary . ( Moss Committee , page 921 . ) In order to make this point perfectly clear I quote the following from page 849 , Moss Committee : MR . Moss : " It is also stated in the record that a board of food and drug inspection was organized to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on matters concerning which the Purefood law says he must make a decision . "  | SECRETARY WILSON : " That is substantially correct . " MR . Moss : " These two boards were created by executive order ? " SECRETARY WILSON : " Yes . " MR . Moss , : " Then the powers and the duties of either one of the boards were fixed by executive order and not by statute ? " SECRETARY WILSON : " That is right . I do not think there was any special order sent to me to do that , but President Roosevelt appealed to the presidents of the big universities to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Dunlap from Ann Arbor . So I doubt if T had a special order , although there was a very clear understanding what was to be done . " MR . Moss : " The question I had in mind was that the Board of Food and Drug Inspection was not created by statute but was created by executive order . " SECRETARY WILSON : " That is what I was doubting . It was not created by statute . I created it for the purpose of ' getting information and all that , but of the three gentlemen on the board , two were in the Department , and in bringing in Dr. Dunlap , an additional chemist , made the third one , so technically there was no general order of the President to do that , but there was a clear understanding that it would be done . " We should not forget that in the legislation of Congress specific duties are often assigned to particular units of administration of a character which does not permit of executive interference . I may cite in this connection the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comptroller of the Treasury is assigned by Congress certain specific duties . Even the President of the United States can not legally interfere with the Comptroller 's prerogatives . The story is told of a case in the Grant administration where the decision of the Comptroller was particularly objectionable to certain citizens . They went to the President  | and asked him to rescind the comptroller 's opinion . President Grant , who believed in obeying the law , replied that he could not legally alter a comptroller 's decision . He said : " If I thought it was a very bad decision I might change comptrollers and get one who would decide the way I think he should . In this case there does not seem to be any exigency demanding any such action . " The Bureau of Chemistry had specific duties assigned to it . Theoretically these duties could not be repealed by executive order . Practically in this case they were , but , of course , illegally . The proper way was to follow the suggestion of Grant , and remove the Chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episode of the whisky conference , on February 22 , 1907 , was ended the Secretary of Agriculture walked into my office one morning in company with a young man whom I had never before seen , and introduced him as " Professor F. L. Dunlap , your associate . " I said : " Mr. Mr. Secretary , my what ? " He said : " Your associate . I have appointed an associate in the Bureau of Chemistry who will be entirely independent of the Chief and who will report directly to me . During the absence of the Chief he will be acting chief of the Bureau . " I was astounded and dumbfounded at this action , Ile handed me at the same time the letter in which he had established this office and described the duties of the officer . Whatever qualification Dr. Dunlap had for the office to which he was appointed does not appear . In the first place he was to take the office of Acting Chief in my absence , a position which was filled most ably by Dr. W. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Bigelow had rare judgment and discrimination . I depended upon him largely for the control of the personnel of the Bureau . He was efficient , firm , just and capable . He had grown up in the Bureau from a humble position to be , . for several years , my first assistant . There was no one else so capable as he to discharge the duties of Chief in my absence . This action of the Secretary was a direct insult to one of the most able men with whom I have ever worked . At the same time he put in charge of the Bureau during the absence of the Chief a person who knew nothing of its personnel , nothing of its activities , nothing of its duties either under the food law or otherwise , and wholly unskilled and untrained in the control of a large Bureau of several hundred members , as was the Bureau of Chemistry at that time . This was an astounding action . At the same time I was informed that the Secretary had organized a Board of Food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law nor by any action of Congress , nor by any appropriation made by Congress . Its purpose was to take away from the Bureau all its power and activities under the Food Law . This body was composed of the Chief of the Bureau as Chairman , with Dr. F. L. Dunlap and Mr. George P. McCabe as its other two members . As long as Dr. Dunlap acted with Mr. McCabe ? and that was always ? all decisions in regard to food adulteration , placed by law in the hands of the Bureau of Chemistry , were approved or disapproved by the other two members of the Board . This was a complete paralysis of the law . This Board was appointed by General Order III , on April 25 , 1907 . The time that elapsed from February 22d , when the whisky case was erroneously decided by the Solicitor , to April 25th , 1907 , was only a  | little over two months . This order was issued before the final decision on the whisky question by the Attorney-General was published . The order reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Secretary , Washington , D. C. , April 25 , 1907 . There is hereby created in the Department of Agriculture a Board of Food and Drug Inspection . The members of this board will be Dr. Harvey W. Wiley , Chief , Bureau of Chemistry , chairman ; Dr. Frederick L. Dunlap , associate chemist , Bureau of Chemistry ; and Mr. George P. McCabe , Solicitor of the Department of Agriculture . The hoard will consider all questions arising in the enforcement of the food and drugs act of June 30 , 1906 , upon which the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture is necessary , and will report its findings to the Secretary for his consideration and decision . All correspondence involving interpretations of the law and questions arising under the law not theretofore passed upon by the Secretary of Agriculture shall be considered by the board . The board is directed to hold frequent meetings , at stated times , in order that findings may be reported promptly . " In addition to the above duties , the Board of Food and Drug Inspection shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drugs act of June 30 , 1906 , as provided by regulation 5 of the rules and regulations for the enforcement of the food and drugs act approved October 17 , 1906 . ( Signed ) JAMES WILSON , Secretary of Agriculture . ( Expenditures in Department of Agriculture , Hearings July-August , 1911 , page 429 . ) First you will note that this Board was created in the Department of Agriculture and not in the Bureau of Chemistry . The result of the appointment of a board of Food Hid Drug Inspection was that the functions of the  | Bureau as defined by the law were entirely paralyzed . The Solicitor of the Department was made , by General Order No. 140 , the supreme arbiter in all cases . In all of the decisions which he rendered , without exception , the Secretary of Agriculture supported him . Encouraged by the success of the first effort to evade the provisions of the law through the appointment of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection , the time was propitious to push the matter further . The services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would sympathize with the efforts to defeat the purpose of the law had made that result possible . There was still needed some further encouragement to attack the activities of the Bureau in the matter of what was injurious to health . Up to this time the decisions of the Bureau on these points had been respected . To eliminate the Bureau completely , some plan had to be devised to counteract the decisions reached . A remarkable incident made it possible to use the President of the United States in the accomplishment of this purpose . As an eye and ear witness of the event about to be described I am able now to set down exactly what occurred . Adulterators of our foods who were using benzoate of soda particularly in ketchup , and saccharin particularly in canned corn , had visited President Roosevelt and urged him to curb the activities of the Bureau of Chemistry in its opposition to these practices . They had spent the greater part of the day in the President 's office . He promised to take these matters into consideration the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He invited the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry to come to  | his office at ten o'clock on the day following and listen to the protests of the gentlemen mentioned above . At the appointed hour we all met in the President 's office , or as I recall , in that part of his office where Cabinet meetings were usually held . When all were assembled he asked the protestants to repeat in the presence of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry the demands which they had made upon him the day before . The three chief protestants were Curtice Brothers of Rochester , N. Y. , Williams Brothers of Detroit , Michigan , and Sherman Brothers of New York , represented by James S. Sherman , M.C. , who was near his election as Vice-President of the United States in 1908 . There were a number of lawyers and others closely related to the protestants , making a very goodly number in all . They were loath to repeat the charges but Mr. Roosevelt insisted that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries spoke . He told the well-known " sob " story of how the business of putting up ketchup would be utterly destroyed if the decisions of the Bureau banning benzoate were carried into effect . It was a touching and pathetic recital of the ultimate confiscation of hundreds of thousands of invested capital . There was no way in which this disaster could be diverted except to overrule the conclusions of the Bureau . The Chief of the Bureau was dramatically set forth as a radical , impervious to reason and determined to destroy legitimate business . After this revital was completed , Mr. Roosevelt turned to Mr. Wilson and said : " What is your opinion about the propriety and desirability of enforcing the rulings of your Chief of Bureau ? " Mr. Wilson replied : " The law demands that substances which are added to foods for any purpose which are deleterious to health shall  | be forbidden . Dr. Wiley made extensive investigations in feeding benzoated goods to healthy young men and in every instance he found that their health was undermined . " The President then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied as follows : " Mr. President , I do n't think ; I know by patient experiment that benzoate of soda or benzoic acid added to human food is injurious to health . " On hearing this opinion the President turned to the protestants , struck the table in front of him a stunning blow with his fist , and showing his teeth in the true Rooseveltian fashion , said to the protestants : " This substance that you are using is injurious to health and you shall not use it any longer . " If matters had rested there the crowning blow to the food law would have been prevented . Mr. Sherman , however , took the floor and said : " Mr. President , there was another matter that Ise spoke to you about yesterday that is not included in what you have just said about the use of benzoate . I refer to the use of saccharin in foods . My firm last year saved $4,000 by sweetening canned corn with saccharin instead of sugar . We want a decision from you on this question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the customary questions . I was entirely too precipitate in the matter . I addressed the President without his asking me , which is considered an offense to royalty or to a President . In the presence of rulers , we should always wait until we are spoken to before joining in the conversation . Had I followed this pre cept of respect the catastrophe which happened night have been avoided . I immediately said to the President : " Every- one who ate that sweet corn was deceived . Ile thought he was eating sugar , when in point of fact he was eating a coal tar product totally devoid of food value and extremely injurious to health . "  | This answer was the basis for the complete paralysis of the Food Law . Turning to me in sudden anger the President changed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde , and said : " You tell me that saccharin is injurious to health ? " I said , " Yes , Mr. President , I do tell you that . " He replied , " Dr. Rixey gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. President , he probably thinks you may be threatened with diabetes . " To this he retorted , " Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot . " This remark of the President broke up the meeting . Had he only extended his royal Excalibur I should have arisen as Sir Idiot . That distinction has not departed from me to this day . The thing which hurts most is that in the light of my long career I fear I deserved it . The next day the President issued an order establishing the Referee Board of Consulting Scientific Experts . In order that his favorite sweetener might have fair hearing he asked Dr. Ira Remsen , who held a medal given him by the Chicago Chemical Society as the discoverer of saccharin , to be chairman and to select the other members . According to the ordinary conception of a juror Dr. Remsen would not have been entitled to sit on the subject of saccharin . Such little matters as those , however , were not dominating with the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eden " Of man 's first disobedience and the fruit Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste Brought death into the world and all our woe " the creation of the Remsen Board of Consulting Scientific Experts was the cause of nearly all the woes that subsequently befell the Pure Food Law . Joined to the creation of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection there was little left of the method prescribed by Congress for its enforcement .  | From this time on all the interests seeking to paralyze the enforcement of the food and drugs act acted as one body under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture . The rectifiers were perhaps the best organized of the enemies of the pure food and drugs legislation . The interests that supported and demanded the use of benzoate of soda represented only a minority of the manufacturers of ketchup . Those who demanded the free use of sulphurous acid and sulphites were confined to the manufacturers of cane molasses and of dried fruits . Those who demanded the use of saccharin were only a very small part of the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people who were anxious to use alum , however , represented a great majority of baking-powders . Those manufacturers who made baking powder of phosphates and tartrates were not so numerous and did not do so big a business as the makers of alum powders . The whole body of adulterators and misbranders of our foods who were depressed by the results of the decision of the question of what is whisky were restored to optimism and tremendous activity by the appointment both of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection and of the Remsen Board . By this time , however , public sentiment which had been so unanimously in favor of food and drug legislation was awakened to the danger which came from the betrayal of the cause of pure foods by these executive proclamations . The daily , weekly , and monthly press of the United States were almost solidly opposed to these illegal activities of the executive officers in charge of the pure food and drugs legislation . Not a day passed without numerous attacks upon this laxity of administration appearing in all parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs later on . The Secretary of Agriculture was perfectly acquainted with the incident just described in regard to the origin of the Remsen Board . Nevertheless , in the following statements to the fruit growers of California he ascribed the origin of the Remsen Board to a totally different cause . I quote from page 847 of the Moss Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Agriculture : I went out to the Pacific Coast , I think it was in 1907 to look at the forests which had just come to our department . Telegrams began to come all around me , and finally reached inc that something was seriously the matter at San Francisco , and I wired back that I would be there at a certain ( lay , and I went there . I found the mayor , the bankers , the business men and the farmers in a very great commotion . They wanted me to talk . I said , " I do not know what to say , I will listen ; you talk , gentlemen . " " Well , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growing and drying of fruits . These dried fruits are contracted for by the big eastern merchants . Our people borrow money from the banks , and when the fruit is sold everything is straightened out and things go on , but you people in Washington say we can only use 350 milligrams of sulphur to the kilo , and the eastern men who have contracted for our fruit will not make their contracts good ; they are afraid it will not keep . " After listening to these good people all day I said , " I see the condition you are in , gentlemen . I do not think the American Congress in making this law intended to stop your business . We have not learned quite enough in Washington to guide your business without destroying it ; we will know better by and by , but I will tell you what to do . Just go on as you used to go on and I will not take any action to seize your goods or let them be seized or take any case into court until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all of that . In the meanwhile I shall send a chemist from our Bureau of Chemistry out here , and I want to get the best chemist in your state at  | your State University at Berkeley , put the two together and try to get the facts , " and we did that . They worked that summer ; and before I think they completed all they would like to have done the Referee Board came * * * I think that about answers the question why the Board was created . When the chemists made their report , Secretary Wilson promptly refused to have it printed because they had found a harmless substitute for sulphur fumes . The hearings accorded the users of saccharin , after the report on saccharin by the Referee Board had been published , developed the following curious incident . The President selected the alleged discoverer of saccharin as Chairman of the new committee to revise the findings of the Bureau of Chemistry . This committee entirely reversed President Roosevelt 's decision that benzoate of soda was a harmful substance . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the harmlessness of saccharin . In their report they permitted the use of a sufficient amount of saccharin to sweeten foods , but they were of the opinion that if one consumed over 3/10th of a gram of saccharin at any one time it might prove injurious and that also as a sweetener it was a fraud . The manufacturers of saccharin asked for and secured a hearing on this point . The hearing was held before Secretary Wilson and Secretary Nagel . Addressing the saccharin manufacturers , Secretary Wilson ( Page 908 , Moss Committee ) made the following statement : I want to say frankly to you gentlemen that the Referee Board was organized and put in action for the very purpose of conserving the interests of the manufacturers , by insuring them a sane hearing , and , that being the case , it is the best the Government , can do .  | To the users of burning sulphur he promised complete immunity until the Remsen Board made its decision . In point of fact , that came only after many years . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has continued for twentytwo years and bids fair to go on forever . Now to the makers of saccharin he says the Remsen Board was created to be sure manufacturers get a " sane hearing . " The plain inference is that the hearing specified in the Act is not " sane . " Of course Secretary Wilson was right in so frankly stating the purpose for which the Referee Board was created . Manufacturers of adulterated goods were never shut out from a full and , fair hearing . That was always available before the Courts when they were cited to appear as violaters of the law . The Referee Board was an effective buffer for all this class of manufacturers , It prevented a full and fair hearing of the ease before a jury and a United States Court . It was the most baleful influence toward the degradation of the food supply of our country that ever existed . The Referee Board has passed away , but the evil effects of its activites will be felt for all time to come . Its decisions and its activities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only hope of the future lies in the possibility of some day getting a Secretary of Agriculture who with one stroke of his pen will erase forever from the records of the Department every decision of the Referee Board and every regulation made in conformity therewith , and remove every administrative officer who willingly carries these decisions and regulations into effect . The officials , paid experts and aides of the low-grade maufacturers realized very keenly their unpopularity  | as reflected in the notices of their activities which appeared in the newspapers and magazines . This sensibility caused Dr. Remsen at the end of his testimony before the Moss Committee to express his feelings which have.been recorded in another place , Prior to this he was keenly sensitive to what the newspapers were saying about him and his Board . On Feb. 11th , 1910 , in a letter to the Secretary of Agriculture , ( Moss Committee , Page 366 ) he said : " A representative of our principal newspaper brought me yesterday an inflammatory article which had been sent by the Washington correspondent . The object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board on the sulphur question . It was venomous and inflammatory to the last degree . It also took up the benzoate question with the object of showing how entirely unreliable the work of our Board had been . Our bombastic friend , C. A. L. Reed* of Cincinnati , was held up as a great and good man and a high authority . I presume , this attack has been sent all over the country . I made some comments on it and the newspaper to which it was sent here declined to publish it . I have no doubt as to the source of that article . It was altogether the worst thing that I have seen . " The curious thing about all this is that the Secretary of Agriculture and his aides , the Remsen Board and their followers were continually insinuating that there was some one in Washington who inspired all these criticisms of the Remsen Board . They were never bold enough to come out openly and say who this person was . It is perfectly plain who was in their minds . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , not by Secretary Wilson , but by myself , was refused publication when it was completed and has never yet seen the light of day . Dr. Bigelow in this report showed how by dipping the freshly cut fruits  | in a weak solution of common salt and then drying them a product was produced equal in color to the sulphured article and far more palatable , wholesome , and desirable in every way . Large quantities of dried fruits made by this process were shipped to Washington , submitted to dealers and pronounced a far superior product in every way to the ordinary sulphured article . Also attention should here be called to the fact that the meat inspection law specifically denies the use of sulphur dioxide and sulphites in the preparation of meats on the ground that a preservative of this kind is injurious to health . Its use had been discarded practically before the regulation forbidding it was made by reason of the scandal of embalmed beef which stirred this country deeply ( luring the Spanish War . In other words the use of any sulphur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dried fruits it was necessary to prevent the destruction of the dried fruit business , in the eyes of the Secretary of Agriculture . Further questioning of the Secretary threw additional light on this point : MR . FLOYD : You , personally , as Secretary , were made responsible , but President Roosevelt acted in harmony with you in establishing this referee board ? SECRETARY WILSON : We have to obey the President of the United States when he indicates what he wants . MR . FLOYD : I understand . The President sanctioned this board ? SECRETARY WILSON : Oh , yes . He wrote to the presidents of the great universities and got them to recommend men , and when the men came that he wanted he ordered me to appoint them , and I appointed them . MR . HIGGINS : Mr. Secretary , in your observation of the enforcement of this law , is it your opinion , based upon that observation , that it was a wise thing to have a referee board ?  | SECRETARY WILSON : It certainly was my judgment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Is that confirmed by your experience with it ? SECRETARY WILSON : I have no reason to conclude that it was not wise . MR . HIGGINS : Are you familiar with the character of the gentlemen who make up that board and their scientific attain-ments ' ? SECRETARY WILSON : By reputation only ; I did not know them personally , any of them . MR . HIGGINS : Have you ever imposed any restrictions on them as to the methods of investigation ? SECRETARY WILSON : No . I told them frankly when they began that nobody had any business to interfere with them anywhere ; that they were to find us the facts with regard to what we submitted to them ; and I did not impose any restrictions and nobody else had any right to , unless it was the President , and I did not think he would . MR . MAYS : Did you have any doubt in your mind as to the legality of their appointment at the time ? SECRETARY WILSON : Never . MR . FLOYD : Now , Mr. Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the referee board ? SECRETARY WILSON : I suppose I could count them on my fingers . MR . FLOYD : The chairman tells me that that is in the record . SECRETARY WILSON : Very likely it is in the record . MR . FLOYD : Now , under the pure-food law , as I understand it , Mr. Secretary , the work of the Bureau of Chemistry is preliminary to a prosecution ? SECRETARY WILSON : Oh , surely . MR . FLOYD : And no prosecution can be instituted against anyone in a criminal procedure until the Bureau of Chemistry has made an adverse finding and you have so certified to the district attorney ' ? SECRETARY WILSON : That is the way it is done . MR . FLOYD : Now , I am going to ask you a question that I would ask other witnesses as to the effect of the decision of the referee board . In case the Bureau of Chemistry should make a finding adverse to the use of a certain commodity on the ground that it was deleterious to health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the referee board should ; make a contrary decision , is there any way , under the regulatlions. to your knowledge , that the question at issue between the Bureau of Chemistry and the referee board could be taken Into the courts and be settled by the courts ? SECRETARY WILSON : Of course , I can not state intelligently N it h regard to how a thing might get into the courts , but the department would enforce the decision of the referee board . They would do that , I suppose Mr. FLOYD ( interposing ) : If the decision of the referee board was adverse to that of the Bureau of Chemistry the ect of enforcing the decision of the referee board would to prevent the prosecution of anyone using that commodity ? SECRETARY WILSON : Well , it would depend on ? yes , I see your point ; yes , it would . The unanimous decision of the committee investigating the expenditures of the Department of Agriculture completely exonerated the accused officials and censured their accusers . The activities of two Presidents , three cabinet officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bureau of Chemistry from any efficient steps looking to the enforcement of the Food and Drugs Act created a veritable storm of protest , as has already been indicated , in the press of the country . This protest was voiced most effectively by the attitude of The World 's Work under the able editorship of Walter H. Page . In the issue of that magazine for September , 1911 , the following editorial comment is found , under the title , " The Fight on Dr. Wiley and the Pure Food Law . " There is no better illustration of the difficulty of really effective government than the obstructions that have been put in the way of Dr. Wiley , the head of the Bureau of Chemistry at Washington . So long as the Pure Food and Drugs Act ran foul of only small violators , it was easy to enforce it ; but , as soon as it hit the vested interests of the rich and strong , the most amazing series of successful ob- structions were put in the way ? so amazing and so successful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding numbers of this magazine . Here is a man ? Dr. Harvey W. Wiley ? who has given his whole working life to the protection of the people from bad and poisonous food and drugs . There is no more unselfish or devoted public servant . He has time and again declined offers of lucrative and honorable private work . He has lived and labored for this one purpose . It is to him that we owe the law and the agitation for its enforcement . It is to him that we owe the education of the public which has brought state laws and municipal ordinances for pure food and drugs . It is to him that we owe such an important advance in more careful living and such a quickening of the public conscience as we owe to hardly any other living man ; and the whole people are his debtors . He is the direct cause of a wider and safer public knowledge and of more healthful habits of life . Still the Pure Food and Drugs Act is not yet enforced against the great offenders . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its enactment . The Board , whose duty it is to report violations of the law , consists of Dr. Wiley , Dr. Dunlap , a chemist , and Mr. McCabe , the solicitor of the Department of Agriculture . But out of the thousands of cases of adulteration and fraud that have been discovered , practically no cases against the strongest corporations and groups of law-breakers have been brought to trial . Dr. Wiley is a man of scientific distinction , of accuracy , and of responsibility . Yet his two associates on this board , men , to say the most for them , of far less ability and less distinction , have been permitted to check almost every move that he has made . The aged Secretary of Agriculture has given his confidence and his support to them and withdrawn it from Dr. Wiley . More than this ? the Attorney-General , reversing an opinion prepared by one of his own subordinates and accepting an opinion by Mr. McCabe , declared that the referee board of distinguished chemists ( the Remsen Board ) was authorized by the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain statute ; and this Board has been used to prevent the enforcement of the law against the use  | of benzoate of soda . This Remsen Board has never declared that benzoate of soda is a permissible preservative . It has never been asked whether it can be or is extensively used to preserve rotten food . It was asked only if it proved injurious to the health of strong young men when taken for a time in small quantities . They found that it did these young men no appreciable harm . Then this declaration was used to permit the canners and packers of rotten fruits and vegetables to continue to put them up in benzoate of soda . Even if benzoate of soda does no harm to health , its use in disguising rotten food brings it within the proper prohibition of the law . This incident is a good illustration of the way in which Dr. Wiley has been balked and hindered . Influences , legitimate and illegitimate , have been used to prevent the enforcement of the law in its most important applications . Inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and drugs have carried on a continuous and effective campaign against Dr. Wiley and his work . He has been practically without power to put the law into effect against strong offenders . He has been humiliated by being overruled by his subordinates . He has suffered from an inefficient administration of the Department of which his bureau is a part ; for the venerable Secretary of Agriculture is too old vigorously to administer his great Department . Yet Dr. Wiley , purely for patriotic reasons , has suffered this hindrance and humiliation till some change might come which should unshackle him . On the outside the bad food and drug interests ? or some of them ? have maintained a lobby in Washington , have kept " syndicate " newspaper writers in their pay to write about the unfairness and the injustice of the law and the unreasonableness and " crankiness " of Dr. Wiley . One such organization ? or pretended organization ? some time ago sent a threatening letter to all the most important periodicals , saying that large advertisers would withdraw their patronage if they published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized fight , therefore , against the law and the man . And , although the man 's official power has been curtailed , he has won ? won such a victory for the  | people as will insure the continuance , with new vigor , of the campaign for pure food and drugs , by national law and by local laws . The " charge " against Dr. Wiley that provoked this popular outburst of approval , is not worth explaining . He made an arrangement to pay Dr. Rusby , a distinguished specialist , a higher rate for work per day than the law specified for per diem payments , but less than the law permitted as a yearly salary . By this arrangement the services of Dr. Rusby to the Government were secured for less than if the letter of the law had been followed and he had been paid the yearly salary that the law specified ? since he gave and was to give only a small part of his time to the work . This technical violation of the letter of the law ? if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been customary in many departments of the Government ; for it has common sense and economy to commend it . When the Attorney-General wrote that this offence deserved " condign punishment , " ? the Attorney-General  - -  what shall be said of him with respect ? Surely it was a narrow and silly recommendation . He put a greater value on a microscopic legal technicality than on the incalculable service of a man whose work is worth more to the health and happiness of the people than the work of many Presidents and Attorneys-General . Dr. Wiley 's " offence " was instantly forgotten by the public , which has some common sense if not much legal knowledge . But the accusation was important for this reason : it showed the determination of those who brought it to get rid of him . Now , if Dr. Wiley deserves dismissal for any sufficient reason , it is proper and it is the duty of somebody to present such a reason . But to propose " condign punishment " for saving the public money by following a common custom of paying for professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rid of him . The upshot of it all is that Dr. Wiley has been made sort of popular hero . Now popular heroism has decided disadvantages and even dangers . It is fair to Dr. Wiley t say that he has not sought such a place on the stage . he has his vanities ( who has n't ? ) and the popular apprecia tion of his work is of course welcomed by him , as it ought  | to be . But mere personal popularity and a personal " fight " are likely to obscure the main matter at stake . The main matter is the Pure Food and Drugs Act ? not only nor mainly Dr. Wiley and his personal vindication , but the firm and permanent establishment of this fact and purpose : that no opposition of interested law-breakers , no personal jealousies , no departmental feuds , no infirm and feeble administration of any Department , no narrow legal technicalities shall longer hinder the execution of the law that guards the health of the people . This is of far greater importance than anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face " or dignity . It has been made plain that the administration of the Agricultural Department is feeble . Feuds and cliques are not permitted to obstruct the laws in well-administered institutions . And it has again been made plain by the Attorney-General that this is a " legal " administration ; and , again , that the President 's amiable qualities lead him to patch-up and smooth-over troubles that become worse with every patching and smoothing and can then be removed only after public discussion and possible scandal . The incident ought and seems likely to bring big results in rallying public opinion to the support of the law and of its author and zealous and useful guardian . The investigation by the Congressional Committee that has the subject in hand will bring out facts that are likely to make the law far stronger than it has ever been . The editor of The World 's Work did not have to wait long to know the conclusions reached by the committee investigating the expenses of the Department of Agriculture . The report was issued early in 1912 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete reversal of the penalties which the personnel board had inflicted , or tried to inflict on the Chief of the Bureau and his assistants . Before the committee 's report was published , however , the President of the United States , who had been asked to approve the dismissal of the Chief of the Bureau ,  | wrote the following letter to the Secretary of Agriculture ( Page 2 of the Report ) : " The truth is , the limitations upon the bureau chiefs a heads of departments to exact per diem compensation for the employment of experts in such cases as this is of doubtful legislative policy . Here is the pure-food act , which of the highest importance to enforce and in respect to which the interests opposed to its enforcement are likely to have all the money at their command needed to secure the nu effective expert evidence . The Government ought not to at a disadvantage in this regard , and one can not withhold one 's sympathy with an earnest effort on the part of Dr. Wiley to pay proper compensation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute , certain in the beginning , when questions arising under it are capital importance to the public . " Other high lights of the report of the committee a summarized below : " The committee on expenditures in the Department Agriculture beg leave to submit the following report of the recent hearings commonly referred to as the " Wiley investigation . " This inquiry was instituted on information that an alleged conspiracy had been entered into bete. certain high officials of the Bureau of Chemistry and H. H. Rushy whereby Dr. Rusby was to be paid a copensation for his services at a higher rate than authorized law . In the discharge of its duties tinder rules of the House , your committee made a patient a careful investigation of the whole controversy . Your committee regards the " Wiley Investigation . " called , only an incident in its broader inquiry into the organization and administrative routine of the Bureau Chemistry and the Referee Board . We failed find from the evidence in the whole case that there exits any secret agreement or that the terms of compensation rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designedly or otherwise . We therefore find from the evidence adduced that the charges of conspir have not been established , but , on the contrary , that the accused officials were actuated throughout solely by desire  | to procure for the Bureau of Chemistry an efficient assistant in the person of Dr. H. H. Rusby under terms and conditions which those officials believed to be in entire accord with the law , regulations , and practice of the Department of Agriculture . " The record shows that three members of the Referee Board were in attendance at the trial at Indianapolis , Indiana , in the capacity of witnesses at the instance and on behalf of the plaintiffs in the suit to which Curtice Brothers and Williams Brothers , who are interested in the sale of food stuffs to which soda benzoate has been added as a preservative , and that the expenses of these witnesses were paid by the Department of Agriculture . In the opinion of your committee the payment of these expenses by the Department of Agriculture was wholly without warrant of law . " Your committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Agriculture , whose long service as the head of the Department of Agriculture has been of signal service to the American people . From the beginning , however , the honorable Secretary has apparently assumed that his duties in the proper enforcement of the pure-food laws are judicial in character , whereas in fact they are wholly administrative and ministerial . This misconstruction of the law is fundamental and has resulted in a complex organization within the Department of Agriculture , in the creation of offices and boards to which have been given , through Executive order , power to overrule or annul the findings of the Bureau of Chemistry . " The statute created the Bureau of Chemistry as an agency to collect evidence of violations of the food and drug act and to submit this evidence duly verified to the Department of Justice for judicial action . The Secretary of Agriculture is the officer whose duty it is to transmit this evidence from the Bureau of Chemistry to the Department of Justice . Added to this simple duty is the more responsible obligation delegated to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chemistry by granting a hearing to parties from whom samples were collected and in the light of these hearings , of deciding whether or not the findings of the bureau are free from error .  | " This construction of the law , which , in the opinion of your committee , is the correct one , places the judicial deter . mination of all disputes in the courts , where the standard of purity in foods must finally be established . It also mak it the imperative duty of district attorneys to proceed against all violators of the law on receipt of certified reco of cases prepared by the Bureau of Chemistry ; but if accept this construction of the law in its full meaning , it is apparent that at the time of the taking effect of this la the prompt prosecution of every infraction , whether of major or minor importance , was an impossibility , as sue a course would have utterly congested the business of courts . " Thus the administration of the law began with a poli of negotiation and compromise between the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The strength of the statute and the jurisdiction of t courts can not be affected by the executive orders of t Secretary of Agriculture , though they be issued in obedien to the suggestion of the President of the United States " These respective duties of the Secretary and Bureau a enumerated separately in the statute and whatever oth duties either may be charged with in the administration the Act come by virtue of the rules and regulations esta lished by the Secretary of Agriculture , the Secretary of t Treasury , and the Secretary of Commerce and Labor . " The Act of Congress approved March 4 , 1907 , contains this provision , and hereafter the Secretary of Agricultu is hereby authorized to make such appointments , promotions , and changes in salaries , to be paid out of the lump sum of the several bureaus , divisions and offices of Department as may be for the best interest of the service . In view of these provisions of law your committee is of t opinion that there may be authority under the law for t creation and maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the discharge of any duty enjoin on him in his official capacity ; but raises the question as its legality on the sole ground that the determination of general questions submitted by the Secretary to the Refe Board is not enjoined upon him under the law .  | " We have here presented the very crux of the controversy which has been waged over the terms of the pure-food law , and which , fortunately for your committee , has been recently discussed ( by the Supreme Court ) in a decision of the United States vs . Morgan , et al . The weight of this decision clearly denies to the Department of Agriculture any judicial authority . We have thus presented another weighty question to be considered in this connection as to the necessity , wisdom , or sound policy of maintaining such a board at a heavy expense to the Government when the work done by it is largely a duplication of work performed , or which might be performed by the Bureau of Chemistry . The functions of this board as at present constituted are purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon any body . The Secretary can follow or ignore their recommendations as he sees fit . The Honorable Secretary of Agriculture seems to have regarded the findings of this board as conclusive in all cases over the opinions and findings of the Bureau of Chemistry , the tribunal which by express terms of statute is vested with authority to determine the questions of adulteration and misbranding within the meaning of the act . In the practice of the Department , the Bureau of Chemistry has been restrained from examining any specimens of foods and drugs under any general subject which is submitted to the Referee Board during the time of examination of such questions by such Board ; and if such general subject is submitted to the Referee Board before the Bureau of Chemistry has made any examination of specimens to determine the question of adulteration and misbranding , then the Bureau is not permitted by the Secretary to make any such examination until the Board shall have made its report . " It has resulted in another remarkable situation , namely , that under the practice of the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the findings and opinions of the Referee Board can not be referred to the Courts and thus permit a judicial decision to be made as is comprehended under the plain provisions of the law . It would thus happen that if the Bureau of Chemistry were right and the Referee Board were in error that violations  | of the law would receive protection through the proposed enforcement of the law ; because the effect of such a policy is to give this advisory Board , created by Executive order paramount authority over the Bureau of Chemistry and lodges in the personal advisers of the Secretary the power to annul the decisions of the Bureau within the Department of Agriculture which was created by law . " These luminous opinions of the committee investigating the expenditures of the Department of Agriculture show that not a dollar of the money expended by the Referee Board was legally expended . At the time this investigation took place the total expenditures made by the Referee Board of the money appropriated by Congress to enforce the Food and Drugs Act amounted to over $175,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promoting violations of the law . It seems strange in view of these findings which were approved by the House of Representatives that no effort was made to impeach the Secretary of Agriculture and the President of the United States who had thus perverted money appropriated for tt particular use to activities totally repugnant to the purpose of the appropriation . The following violations of law were permitted and protected by this crime , namely , the use of benzoate of soda as a preservative of foods , the use of sulphur dioxide and sulphites as bleaching agents and food preservatives , the use of saccharin as a sweetener in foods up to an amount not exceeding three-tenths of a gram , and the free and unrestricted use of alum in food products . It is a striking comment also on the attitude of Congress and the people at large that no steps have ever been taken from 1911 to 1928 to correct these outrages on the American people and to attempt to restore the law to its power and purpose as enacted . Administration  | after administration has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the evidence adduced over a period of six weeks the House committee on expenditures unanimously declared the Referee Board to be an illegal organization . It had a very good reason for doing so even before the evidence was considered . The matter had been decided by an assistant to Attorney-General Wickersham in a report from the Department of Justice dated March 31 , 1909 . This was fully two years and more before the decision of the investigating committee was rendered . This report of the Department of Justice was signed by J. A. Fowler , assistant to the Attorney-General . It is printed in full in the proceedings of the committee , pages 205 and following . Attorney-General Fowler called attention to the fact that at the time the committees of the House and the Senate met for final conference on the food and drugs bill , the House bill contained a provision authorizing the appointment of a committee of five experts to consider questions f deleterious or injurious substances in foods , and to establish food standards . The Senate bill did not contain a provision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bureau of Chemistry to perform these functions . The Senate conferees insisted on the elimination of the House provision for special board and this was acceded to by the conferees from the House . When the conference report was presented to the two houses Mr. Mann , manager for the House made the following statement in answer to a question by Mr. Pollard : MR . POLLARD : Was there any change made in the provision f the House bill wherein we provided that a board of five  | inspectors should be selected to pass upon the wholesomeness or deleteriousness of the foods ? MR . MANN : That provision was in Section 9 , directing the Secretary of Agriculture to determine standards and the entire section goes out . As I stated in the House when the bill was before the House , it is the courts which must determine in the end as to the question of the wholesomeness or the deleteriousness of preservatives or of any article of food . The Senate conferees were unalterably opposed to that provision and as it was not an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to save the rest of the bill practically intact as the House had enacted it . ( Record 59th Congress , First Session , Page 9738 , Expenditures in the Department of Agriculture , page 269 . ) MR . FOWLER : " This statute authorizes the prescribing of such regulations as are consistent with law , and for the reason above stated I regard the appointment of this Board of Referees as inconsistent with law . Senator McCumber also commented in the Senate on this same subject , as follows : " Now what have we eliminated from this bill ? Senators will remember that the House measure provided for the fixing of standards and it called to the assistance of the Secretary of Agriculture certain experts who were to aid him in determining what the standards should be and also provided that the standards so established by them should be for the guidance of the court . The Senate has always contended that the power to fix standards should not be given to any man and the House conferees receded from that portion of the House amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear intention of Congress the Solicitor of the Department of Agriculture wrote an opinion to the effect that the appointment of the Referee Board was legal and this opinion was adopted by Attorney-General Wickersham as a choice between the opinion of the Solicitor of the Department of Agriculture and the opinion of his own assistant in the Department of Justice .  | With the promulgation of the opinion of the AttorneyUeneral , the effacement of the Bureau of Chemistry from any further participation in the enforcement of the food and drugs act was completed . Even the Board Of Food and Drug Inspection was deprived of its office of confirming or overturning the decisions of the Bureau of Chemistry . Under General Order No. 140 the Solicitor of the Department was made the sole arbiter Of the recommendations which should go to the Secretary in regard to whether or not an article was misbranded or adulterated . General Order No. 140 is found on page 10 of the report of the committee . The committee expressed the following opinion thereon : " Under the terms of this order all the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with such summaries as the solicitor may prescribe is referred to the solicitor to determine whether or not a prima facie case has been made . We are at a loss to understand what favorable results can come from the preparation of such summaries in the Bureau of Chemistry and their further study in the solicitor 's office . " The committee realized that this was the consummation of the plan of the solicitor . It totally disregarded the provisions of the food-law as to the methods of its execution . It placed the solicitor , not mentioned nor recognized in the law , in the place of the Bureau of Chemistry as the sole arbiter of all processes looking to the enforcement of the act . With this final blow at the vitality of the law its enforcement passed entirely into the hands of the enemies of the law . The public which it was intended to protect was left without any redress . The result was a wild orgy of adulteration and misbranding , paid for by the money of tax-payers appropriated for the enforcement of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by the Government to protect the interests of adulterators and misbranders . Their efforts in this direction were put into effect by the Solicitor of the Department . All the fruits gained by the victory in the enactment of the legislation were thus sacrificed by the direct negation of the law 's demands . The far-reaching effects of this crime against law I have tried to set down in as small a space as possible to do justice to the story . If an expert dietitian and physiologist should take up for study a report on metabolism made by a scientific authority , he would expect first of all that the composition and weight of food ingested should be accurately stated . Without knowing the amount of intake , data respecting the outgo have no significance . In Bulletin 84 , Part 4 , Benzoate of Soda , containing the experimental data of the Bureau of Chemistry , it will be noticed that careful analytical examinations were made of all the foods ingested and the quantities of each kind of food for each subject is accurately stated . The data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feces and urine have a direct significance . In the experiments on the same subject conducted by the Referee Board no attempt was made to have complete analyses of the foods administered nor the quantities thereof eaten . It was all left to the experimentees themselves . This is forcibly brought out by the statement of Dr. Chittenden on page 17 of Report No. 88 of the Referee Board . He says : First , the subjects were not restricted to a limited dietary , but on the contrary were allowed reasonable freedom of  | choice , both as to character and quantity of the daily food . In other words , there was no interference with the normal desires of the individual but each subject was allowed full latitude in the exercise of his personal likes and dislikes . To be sure each day a definite menu was arranged for all three meals , but this was sufficiently generous in character to admit of choice ; further , after a short time sufficient knowledge was acquired of the special tastes of the subjects , so that a daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this method of procedure there was no violation of that physiological good sense so essential in experiments of this character . In the experiments of the Bureau of Chemistry no such latitude was permitted . In the fore period in each case sufficient quantities of the diet prescribed , which was a thoroughly wholesome and well-balanced one , were used to establish an even daily weight of each one . This quantity was given to the subject each day , during the experimental administration of the drug . If during the administration of the benzoic acid the subject would not feel like eating his whole meal , the amount he did not eat was weighed and deducted . This failure of appetite , if no other cause could be found for it , was an indication of the effects produced by the administered preservative . I suppose this method of procedure would be designated by members of the Referee Board as " physiological " nonsense . The records printed in Report No. 88 indicate the wildest riot in diet ever recorded in a physiological investigation . Enormous differences in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the evidence before the court in the Indiana case , page 33 , t his matter was brought to the attention of Dr. Remsen in the following question : Now , Doctor , in order to conduct an examination of that kind , an investigation that was of any very great value , ought n't every article of food that was given to the sub- ject to be analyzed , some part of it , so as to know what it contained ? A. I suppose there are other ways of getting at that besides analyzing it . You can often form generally an opinion of , the character of the food you are giving or examining without analyzing . Q. Are there not variations , for instance in breads ? A. There are variations , undoubtedly . Q. And they are variations of wide extent , are they not , doctor ? A. Well , wide depends on the meaning of the word wide . That is a technical question that I should want to refer to the experts of this Board . Q. You would not be prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of nitrogen that would be found ? A. Not I , no . I could get the information very readily . One moment ? my impression is that there were analyses of some foods made ? very many . Some time in the remote future when all personal matters have passed away and an expert chemist and physiologist calmly reviews the data obtained by the Bureau of Chemistry and the data obtained by the Referee Board on the same subject , they will show a comparison of values of the two investigations which I am quite content to leave to the judgment of the unbiased future . As has been clearly illustrated , the Remsen Board was appointed to protect manufacturing interests . The Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry under his oath was trying to protect the neglected American consumer . One would have thought that in selecting five eminent scientific men that at least some one of them might have revolted from the purpose to which he was assigned . The quotation from Claude Bernard discloses most emphatically the proper psychological attitude of the true investigator when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the user of a deleterious product in foods must justify that use . Prof. A. J. Carlson sees a scientific reason therefor Modern chemistry has opened up another avenue of poisoning the human system through the field of food preservatives and food sub ? t itutes . We have the problem of the harmfulness or the harmlessness of the various baking powders , of benzoic acid as a permissible food preservative , of saccharin as a substitute for sugar , etc . Many of the experiments purporting to prove the permissibility or harmlessness of the substance or preservative , even those carried out by competent scientists , seem to me wholly inadequate . I have in mind , as an example , the experiments'and finding of the Remsen Consulting Board , on the question of saccharin in foods . Under the direction of this board , composed of leading biochemists and chemists , varying quantities of saccharin were fed to a small number of healthy young men , daily , for periods up to nine months . The board concluded that the daily ingestion of this food substitute below a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injurious effects ; above this saccharin produces injury . This conclusion became guide to federal legislation and regulation . Was the above conclusion warranted by the experiments performed ? We think not . All the experiments proved was that the substance ( saccharin ) when taken by healthy young men over this period did not produce any injury that t he commission could detect by the tests used . Society is composed of individuals other than healthy young men , and nine months is a short period in the span of human life . There are many deviations of physiological processes that can not be detected by body weight , food intake , or the chemical examination of the urine . Most of the organs in the body can be injured a great deal before we become actually sick . It would seem a safer principle for governments and society to insist that the burden of proof of harmlessness falls on the manufacturer or the introducer of the new food substitutes rather than on society , and the test of the harmfulness or harmlessness should involve all physiologieal processes of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1928 , page 358 . One of the most remarkable episodes in the activities of the Remsen Board was in connection with the Convention of State , Dairy and Food Officials in their annual meeting in Denver , in 1909 . The previous meeting of this official body was held at Mackinac Island in 1908 . At this meeting vigorous protests against the mutilation of the food law by the creation of the Remsen Board were voiced in the resolutions adopted by  | the convention . These resolutions reflected severely upon the attitude of the Secretary of Agriculture and other officials of the Department in accepting the decisions of this Board which were held to be contrary to law . The Secretary of Agriculture was indignant at this feature of the meeting in 1908 . It is evident that he did not want a repetition of it to occur in 1909 . Previous to the date of the meeting , George P. McCabe , Solicitor , made an official trip to the Central West , which , according to the testimony given , was for the purpose of interviewing prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policies of the Department of Agriculture . As related in the testimony in the Moss Committee on the expendi tures of the Department of Agriculture , Mr. McCabe was somewhat hazy as to the purposes of this trip and as to exactly when it was made . Only two years had passed , but they seemed to have had a remarkable effect upon his memory . Under the urgent question ing of members of the Committee and in a burst of loyalty to his chief he finally told the whole story . To strengthen still further the administration lines in the forthcoming convention , the Secretary of Agri culture requested the members of the Referee Board also to attend this convention . In addition to this urgent request of the Secretary , the President of the forthcoming convention , the Hon. J. Q. Emery , Food and Drug Commissioner of Wisconsin , invited the members of the Referee Board to attend the convention and justify , if they could , the conclusions already reached in the benzoate of soda question . It was particularly desirable , also , to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the chief motive of the appointment of the Remsen Board . The attitude of Dr. Remsen , the Chairman of that Board ,  | and the part played by it in the Denver convention are luminously set forth in the testimony of the Moss committee which follows . The memory of Mr. McCabe , as I have said , was somewhat short , and this seemed to be the case with the memory of Dr. Dunlap . He was specially sent by the Secretary of Agriculture to acquaint Dr. Remsen with his plans for controlling the Denver convention . Dr. Dunlap 's memory in regard to the plan which he discussed with Dr. Remsen was quite as hazy as was Mr. McCabe 's memory in regard to his trip to interview the delegates to the Denver convention . One of the most striking features in connection with this event was the fact that special commissions were issued to the members of . the Remsen Board to cover their expenses in connection with this trip . It was shown by the questioning of the committee that there was doubt as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Remsen Board . That no question might arise with the disbursing officers , this special dispensation was given . The reading of the testimony will be sufficient to illustrate the other points in regard to the appearance of the Remsen Board at Denver . Following this are quotations from the Denver press at the time the meeting was in session . The pages of the testimony are given in each selection . MR . FLOYD : What is saccharin , Doctor ? DR . REMSEN : I can explain that if you want a scientific lecture . I happen to be the discoverer of that substance . I could not explain it in a few words very well . MR . FLOYD : Did you say you were the inventor of saccharin ? DR . REMSEN : No ; I would not say I was the inventor . The  | substance was discovered in the laboratory under my direction in an investigation carried out way back , over 30 years ago . A young man was associated with me in the work , and his name is generally connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . FLOYdD Is it a patent ? DR . REMSEN : He patented it . I did not . Incidentally he made a good deal of money out of it . I did not . MR . FLOYD : For what reason , if to your knowledge , was saccharin referred to your board for investigation ' ? DR . REMSEN : I have no idea why it was referred except the general idea that in every case it was desired to know whether the substance mentioned in the reference is or is not harmful That is the main point . MR . FLOYD : When used in food ? DR . REMSEN : When used in food ; yes . MR . FLOYD : Is saccharin a food within itself or is it a preservative used in foods ? I do not want you to go into a long scientific explanation , of course . DR . REMSEN : It is not a food ; it is to a slight extent a preservative . But the purpose for which it is used is as a sweetening agent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made at a rate which renders sweetness per unit very much cheaper than ordinary sugar . MR . MAYS : Is it harmful ? DR . REMSEN : That was the question . MR . MAYS : And have you decided it ? DR . REMSEN : Yes ; we have made our report . MR . FLOYD : Their opinion is printed in the record . DR . REMSEN : I may say also that it is used as a medicine in diabetes . I believe it is very useful in that disease , as diabetic patients can not take sugar , but can take saccharin and thrive under it . MR . FLOYD : Do you know whether any members of the board selected by you previous to their appointment had taken any special interest in or expressed any opinion of chemical preservatives of food ? DR . REMSEN : I can not answer that question fully , but I can give an answer to the best of my knowledge . They had all been interested in the general problem of the use of preservatives . Two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chittenden was interested in the effect of saltpeter on meat and was engaged in an investigation on that subject until quite recently . He also , I believe , although I am not sure about that ? I have seen this in the newspapers and have not followed it in detail otherwise ? was interested at one time in the investigation of the effects of borax* or boracic acid as a preservative . I think Dr. Long was on that same committee that investigated saltpeter . I am not sure . MR . FLOYD : Did you attend the convention of State and National dairy and food departments at Denver , in 1909 ? DR . REMSEN : Yes , sir ; on the way back from California I stopped there . Page 262-263 . MR . FLOYD : Did you attend on your own volition , or were you directed by the department to attend ? DR . REMSEN : I was not directed ; I was requested . MR . FLOYD : You were requested to attend ? DR . REMSEN : Yes . MR . FLOYD : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . REMSEN : Two or three days ; I am not sure just exactly how long . MR . FLOYD : What was the purpose of that convention , and what were the questions discussed there ? Did they relate to pure foods ? DR . REMSEN : Well , I do not know much about the association . I do know that I was asked by the president of the association to give an address on the subject of the work of the referee board , I think , or at least it had reference to thr benzoate question , and after finding I could stop there conveniently on the way from California and that the other members of the board could do the same , I accepted the invitation . The association discussed all sorts of questions pertaining to things of which I have no knowledge , but I do know that they took up this benzoate question in rather an active way , and I suppose it was felt by the Secretary that it was desirable to have some one there to explain what it all meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as we could gather . They got some wrong impressions of the thing  | and the nature of the work , or what we were appointed for , or what we were doing , and it did seem wise not to let them go too far that way without some explanation from us , which we gave in a dignified way , I think I can safely say . MR . FLOYD : And the expenses of yourself and the other members of the board for this trip to California and this trip to the convention in Denver were paid by the department ? DR . REMSEN : Yes . Of course , the trip to the convention amounted to very little . That was simply stopping over . MR . FLOYD : You state that you addressed the convention yourself . Did any of the other members of the board address the convention , and if so , who ? DR . REMSEN : Dr. Chittenden , Dr. Long and Dr. Herter all addressed the convention , at the request of the president of the association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to state if in the address you made before the convention on the question of benzoate of soda you made a defense of the use of benzoate of soda ? DR . REMSEN : No , Sir . MR . FLOYD : You just discussed the findings ? DR . REMSEN : I discussed the general method of procedure which we had followed . I have nothing to do with the use of benzoate of soda . We were not asked to decide whether it was a good thing to use or not , and we have never expressed ourselves upon that point . THE CHAIRMAN : Your expenses at Denver were also paid by the Department of Agriculture ? DR . REMSEN : . Ve went , as I said yesterday , to California for an important purpose , looking into the sulphuring process , and on our way back we stopped there . We did make a little effort to time our trip back so that we could attend the meeting , because we had been asked to give addresses . We were asked by the president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not sure whether it was two or three , but not more than three . The slight expense of the board during that period in the way of traveling expenses was paid by the THE CHAIRMAN ( interposing ) : You gave an address there ? DR . REMSEN : Yes . THE CHAIRMAN : And the purpose of that address was to  | explain and defend the report you had made to the Secretary of Agriculture ? DR . REMSEN : I did not defend the work . I did n't think that was my business . The report had been made . But I did do this : I explained , somewhat as I have explained to this committee , how the board came into existence , and very little else . I do n't think that the address was ever published . Then , I may say , that after that the work of the board was attacked very violently by Dr. Reed , of Cincinnati , which was most astonishing to me . After that attack I felt it my duty to respond , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything I would not repeat . I will add that to what I said yesterday , because I made really two addresses there . The other members of the board I think did not answer the attack . I think they were satisfied with my answer . THE CHAIRMAN : In making either one of those addresses did you go beyond the official work of your board and defend the use of benzoate of soda as a preservative of food ? DR . REMSEN : No , sir . Dr. Reed 's address was solely in the interest of public health . The criticism he made of the Remsen Board was for its open support of adding benzoate of soda and saccharin to foods . If it was " violent " it was because of Dr. Reed 's indignation that a law passed , as the Supreme Court has said , for the protection of public health , was so flagrantly flouted by the Remsen Board in the two cases then decided , namely , benzoate of soda and saccharin . MR . HIGGINS : Did you desire to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions that have been asked ? DR . REMSEN : There is just one point that I should like to refer to , that has not been brought out in the examination . This board has been aware for some time that there is some influence at work to undermine it and discredit it . We do  | not pretend to know and have not discovered what the source of that influence is ; but it is perfectly clear that that influence is at work . MR . HIGGIN : How does it manifest itself ? DR . REMsEN : Newspaper articles . So far as I know the newspapers almost without exception are opposed to the Remsen Board . Why , I am sure I do n't know . The Remsen Board is an innocent board and does not quite like to be considered guilty before it has been tried , at all events . I have noticed that within the last month nearly every reference to the Remsen Board that has appeared in the papers has put the board in a bad light , and anybody reading those articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole tribe ought to disappear from the face of the earth . Sometimes friends of mine come up to me with long faces and say , " Remsen , it is too bad about this matter . " I say , " What 's the matter ? " They say , " Have n't you seen that article about your board ? " I say , " Oh , no , and do n't show it to me ; I have seen enough . " Now , those articles would not appear day after day , at least I can not imagine they would appear , without there being some influence at work to inspire them . I merely make this statement to show my state of mind . I am getting , as I have confessed , somewhat thicker skinned , and I rather rejoice that I have been through this experience because I think on the whole a thick skin is wort h something . The attack upon the Remsen Board by the public press was nation-wide . The only people who were pleased with it , aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adulterators and misbranders of our foods . At the hotel in Denver I saw a most remarkable phenomenon . There was gathered at Dan ver a strong lobby of the supporters of the Remsen Board . At the head of this lobby , which apparently numbered 100 at least , was Warwick M. Hough , chief attorney for the rectifiers . There seemed to be little enthusiasm among the people of Denver for the See retary of Agriculture , his solicitor , and the members  | of the Remsen Board . There was , however , tremendous enthusiasm of the lobby above referred to for all of these individuals . After adjournment of the afternoon session I saw this lobby gathered around the members of the Remsen Board and Warwick M. Hough 's arm was lovingly encircling the shoulders of Dr. Ira M. Remsen , eminent chemist and president of Johns Hopkins University , and according to his own statement , discoverer of saccharin . Although each member of the Remsen Board was personally known to me except Dr. Alonzo Taylor and Dr. C. A. Herter , not one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in Denver except Dr. Herter . He came up and introduced himself to me and attempted to make some apology for his part in the activities of the Remsen Board . He realized very keenly the condition they were in , in espousing the cause of adulteration , becoming the paid agents of the adulterators , and incurring the universal condemnation of the press and the people of the country . Dr. Herter was then a very sick man . In a few months from that date he died . I have often wondered with what misgivings he approached his end and what feelings the other members of the Board must have had when they realized the universal condemnation which was heaped upon them . I doubt if any reference is ever made in the biographies of these men , as they pass away one by one and their deeds while living are recorded , to the service they rendered their country as members of this Board . THE CHAIRMAN : Might not the fact that you gave certain testimony and the fact that you appeared at the Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this influence that you are speaking about as being inimical to the Remsen Board ?  | DR . REMSEN : I am sure I do n't know , but I can say that it was found that the influence , whatever it was , was at work long before the Denver meeting . THE CHAIRMAN : When the Remsen Board was appointed of course no one expected that it was going to do anything more than give advice to the Secretary of Agriculture in his official duties , and yet , according to your testimony , the Department of Agriculture has suggested to different members to appear in court and give testimony , has paid their expenses at that trial , when the effect would be to affect the decision of the courts in the State of Indiana . DR . REMSEN : Well , it might affect the decision of the court in so far as it would enable them better to get at the truth , which I suppose was the object of the court . THE CHAIRMAN : That may be the object of the court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this referee board , was it ? DR . REMSEN : Of course the referee board was never defined exactly ? exactly what it should do . THE CHAIRMAN : Well , let us define it . Do you understand it now to be part of the purpose of the referee board to in fluence the decisions of the courts of this country ? DR . REMSEN : Why , no ; in no sense , except MR . HIGGINS : Except so far as the truth is concerned ? DR . REMSEN : Except so far as the truth is concerned by telling the facts , and if I am asked to do so I should do so , so far as it would influence the action of the court I should think it would be proper for the board to do so . THE CHAIRMAN : However , I believe you admit that your official report is not evidence ? DR . REMSEN : Yes , sir . THE CHAIRMAN : And it is voluntary with you whether you should appear and give this testimony ? DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not sure . THE CHAIRMAN : And you referred the matter to your superior and it was upon his advice that you gave this testimony i DR . REMSEN : Yes . THE CHAIRMAN : That is the point I wanted to get at , and that you advised Dr. Chittenden also to give his testimony ? DR . REMSEN : Yes ; I did the second time .  | THE CHAIRMAN : Yes ; and that Dr. Chittenden 's expenses were paid by the Department of Agriculture ? Dr .. REMSEN : I believe so . I am not entirely clear about that . MR . HIGGINS : And the Indiana courts had the benefit of the decision which your board had reached as the result of its scientific investigations as to the effect of benzoate of soda ? DR . REMSEN : That was the effect of our appearance , that is all . We did not argue the case , of course . Page 858 . To Secretary Wilson : THE CHAIRMAN : YOU are speaking there about the Board of Food and Drug Inspection ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Taylor about some testimony to be given at Indianapolis , Ind. , and you state there : " I shall consult with our people on the Board of Food and Drug Inspection ( that is , Dunlap and McCabe ) . " What meaning do you attach to that language ? if you care to attach any ? SECRETARY WILSON : There is no hesitation in my mind in telling you all that was in my mind there . THE CHAIRMAN : I recognize the fact that you need not answer unless you wish . SECRETARY WILSON : Oh , I am going to answer it . My answer is this : You are pretty well aware that there was friction between those men , there . You have got that pretty much every bit in your testimony . It would have been an insult to Dr. Wiley to have consulted him in regard to anything concerning benzoate of soda . THE CHAIRMAN : Why ? SECRETARY WILSON : Because he despised it , and everything connected with it , and believed that a big mistake had been made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Referee Board ; that is why . I do not gratuitously offer insults to any of my people . THE CHAIRMAN : I understand also , Mr. Secretary , that you  | have referred the report of the Bureau of Chemistry on the copper question to the Referee Board without publication ? SECRETARY WILSON : Oh , yes ; I remember now . I had two bureaus considering the sulphate of copper , and there was a man in the Plant Industry named Woods who had done a most remarkable lot of work with sulphate of copper . He found by taking a little bag of sulphate of copper and going into a large reservoir that had green scum over it , if he would sail around for an hour and drag that bag after him he would kill every single particle of that green scum there ; and he went to a number of States in the country , and he went to Panama and cleaned up every one of the reservoirs they had . He and the doctor did not come within gunshot of agreeing on sulphate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman , one must go slow when they have two scientists in two different lines and they do not quite agree . It is not best to bring any arbitrary rulings in there , but wait and see if we can not get more light . THE CHAIRMAN : It is a matter of fact , however , the Bureau of Chemistry did make a report upon copper , and it has not been published ? SECRETARY WILSON : Yes ; and that is the reason , Mr. Chairman ; that is the reason . THE CHAIRMAN : Mr. Secretary , will you be willing to have prepared and inserted in the record at this point a complete list of the investigations of the Bureau of Chemistry which you have refused or have failed for any reason to have pub-lished ? SECRETARY WILSON : I could do that ; yes ; I could do that .

THE CHAIRMAN : Is it the policy of the Department of Agrihire , Mr. Secretary , to suppress or refuse publication of the reports which the Bureau of Chemistry may make to you on any questions which are referred to the Referee Board , until , after the board has made its final report ? SECRETARY WILSON : I may have done that . I think probably there is justification for having anything which treats with benzoate of soda handled in that way . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda is a question that was referred to the Referee Board . I think I would not favor printing anything in the department until we heard from them .  | THE CHAIRMAN : As a matter of fact , whether the findings of the Referee Board govern your action , or whether the findings of the Bureau of Chemistry govern your action , is a question which you yourself decide within your own discretion , is it not ? SECRETARY WILSON : Surely . You have to have a secretary there who must decide . THE CHAIRMAN : In other words , the decisions of the Referee Board have no value whatever until approved by you ? I am speaking now legally , and as to its influence upon the administration of the pure food law . Page 865-866 . THE CHAIRMAN : It is true , is it not , Mr. Secretary , that money which you allot to the Referee Board is drawn from money appropriated for the Bureau of Chemistry , and that this allotment is anticipated in the estimates which you make t SECRETARY WILSON : Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appropriate the money . THE CHAIRMAN : And for that reason you do not consult with the chief of bureau in regard to making that particular allotment ? Is that true ? SECRETARY WILSON : The chiefs of the bureaus are always consulted . Dr. Wiley , the , chief of that bureau , is a little touchy on anything of that kind , and one has to bethink himself quite often about getting along smoothly in this world , you know . THE CHAIRMAN : Has Dr. Wiley ever recommended that any money be allotted to the Referee Board from the appropriation under his department ? SECRETARY WILSON : I think I would not want to hurt his feelings by ever mentioning it at all . We had a referee board , and I think a pretty expensive referee board , you will confess . We had gone after big men , and it was costing a good deal of money , and those people nit there at Mackinac Island and got themselves outside of sym ? pathy with the department along those lines , attacked me personally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States was making and the amount of money it was expending to get facts from the greatest chemists in the land made it worthwhile for us to get those big men there  | before that class of men and let them see them and let them hear them . I did not think they comprehended the difference there was between a small chemist and a big one . That was the one thing in my mind . They were in California studying the drying of foods with sulphur , and the arrangement was that they should stop over at Denver on the way back . I was going to the forests , and I arranged and it was my plan to stop there on my way to the forests . I went into the forests from Denver and stayed a month . Those were the plans . There is nothing I care to conceal here , not a thing . Those were the plans and we talked them over , and everyone of them addressed that convention , everyone of them , and I think those people got new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to you page 338 of the hearings of August 3 , to correspondence between yourself and I ) r . Remsen . Dr. Remsen says , in this letter : " It is clear from the newspaper reports that there is pernicious activity ' somewhere . " In your reply you say : " The pernicious activity you speak of is quite evident . " Will you kindly tell the committee what you referred to as " pernicious activity " ? SECRETARY WILSON : Yes . The activity of people attacking that Remsen Board . That is just what it was . THE CHAIRMAN : It was correspondence between you and the chairman of the board . Of course , if this " pernicious activity " is without the Department of Agriculture it would not be proper for us to go into it . But if it is within the Department of Agriculture , it would seem to me proper for is to know what you referred to as " pernicious activity . " SECRETARY WILSON : If you have been watching the public press you have discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have been watching the proceedings of Congress you will no doubt have seen there has been a desperate effort made there for the purpose of destroying the Remsen Board , and things of that kind . That is what I had reference to . THE CHAIRMAN : In your letter of April 19 , 1909 , you say further : " Things will come to a head before a great while , I think , along this line . " Would you care to explain what that means ? SECRETARY WILSON : I thought the work of that board , as it was being done and reported , would settle all those questions .  | THE CHAIRMAN : Do you consider , or did you consider at the time , that the attendance of members of the Remsen Board and Solicitor McCabe at this Denver convention , which we were speaking about heretofore , was in line with their official duties ? SECRETARY WILSON : Yes ; it was a kind of public trial we were having , really , of the Remsen Board . THE CHAIRMAN : Their attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you explain why you issued to each one of them a special authorization for traveling expenses to attend this particular convention , when each one of them had an annual authorization for travel anywhere in the United States upon official business ? SECRETARY WILSON : If you have evidence of that special authorization , you had better call my attention to it . THE CHAIRMAN : Very well , I will be glad to do that . ( Reads letter from Secretary Wilson to Dr. Remsen , dated August 6 , 1909 , wherein it is stated that authorization No. 1163 is amended so as to permit Dr. Remsen and his assistants to attend the Denver convention . ) SECRETARY WILSON : I guess that is correct . What do you want to know about it ? THE CHAIRMAN : I want to know , if this attendance was in line with their official duties , as stated here , why it was necessary they should have special authorization when they had a regular authorization ? SECRETARY WILSON : I presume they had some doubts about stopping off at Denver being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave them all the authorization they would need . THE CHAIRMAN : If there were any doubt it would be doubt as to whether or not that came within their official duties ? SECRETARY WILSON : Precisely . THE CHAIRMAN : Do you hold that you have executive authority to add to the official duties of the Remsen Board other than that prescribed in the order creating them ? SECRETARY WILSON : To this extent , yes . THE CHAIRMAN : To that extent you have ? SECRETARY WILSON : Yes .  | One of the most detestable features of the persecution of those delegates to the Denver Convention of 1909 who opposed the decision of the Remsen Board was the dismissal of Floyd Robison . This action was investigated by the Moss Committee . Mr. Robison was one of a group of state chemists who were occasionally requested to cooperate with the officials of the Bureau of Chemistry in enforcing the Food Law . ( Pages 522-524 . ) MR . Moss : Were there any charges filed against you ? DR . ROBISON : None . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DR . ROBISON : I have . MR . Moss : Please read it to the committee . ( I will quote only last line of this letter . ) DR . ROBISON ( reading ) : " He is removed from the department for the good of the service . James Wilson , Secretary of Agriculture . " Dr. Robison appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture for reasons which led to such drastic action . The Secretary , in his reply , under date of July 25 , 1911 , says : At the meeting of the Association of State and National Food and Dairy Departments at Denver , in July , 1909 , you attracted attention by taking a strong and public position against the policies of the department and of the administration . You appeared in the Federal court in Indianapolis in opposition to the policies of the administration with regard to the reports of the Referee Board on benzoate of soda and the report of the three secretaries with regard to it . * * * I have approved your dismissal for the good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make none .

RoBIsoN : I will read the final recommendation : " Your committee therefore respectfully suggests to this association the wisdom of asking the President of the United States and the honorable Secretary of Agriculture to institute investigations along some such broader lines as indicated above . " MR . Moss : Did you make any address to the Denver convention in which you referred to the Remsen Board one way or the other ? DR . RoBISON : I did not . MR .

Moss : So far as you know , then , did you appear in opposition to the Department of Agriculture in any other manner except casting your personal vote for the president of the association ? DR . RoBISON : I did not . MR . Moss : At whose request did you appear at Indianapolis to give testimony at that trial ? DR . ROBISON : At the request of the Board of Health of the State of Indiana . MR .

MR . Moss : Were you warned in any way by the Department of Agriculture not to do this ? DR . ROBISON : I was not . Replying to President Emery , Secretary Wilson said : " I came out here to listen , and I glean from the address of your president that the Department of Agriculture , which I thought had been doing much , has been doing nothing . Now let me tell you some of the things that it has done within the last year or so . " The Secretary then enumerated some of the achievements of the department . " Now with regard to a few preservatives , there is a difference of opinion among the chemists of the world . One of these questions is benzoate of soda .  | " The manufacturers of the United States went to the President when the use of this was prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the presidents of the great universities to appoint some men to conduct an investigation who were competent to do the work . Under his authority I appointed five such gentlemen , who , I believe , are the best chemists in the United States , if not in the whole world . " President Emery has attacked their report . Now I have but one request . You have arranged a place upon your program to have the Referee Board here on Thursday to be heard . All I ask is that the hearing be a full and fair one . " With representatives of interests aggregating more than $500,000,000 present to enter protest against a tentative " model " food law bill , which will probably be presented to the pure food convention for endorsement , the committee which drafted the bill met last night at the Brown and gave the manufacturers ' side a hearing . ( The Daily News , Denver , Colo. , Aug. 25 , 1909 . ) The morning session was quite as pungent , although in another way . The convention was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shafroth made an address of welcome . He complimented both Secretary Wilson and Dr. H. W. Wiley , Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry at Washington , upon the work they have done for the country . He termed Secretary Wilson " the greatest Secretary of Agriculture the country has ever known , " and the remark was greeted with enthusiastic cheers . He favored a uniformity in the state and national food laws and finished with an eulogy of Colorado 's growth and development . PRESIDENT EMERY : " We held that if the National Government should indorse benzoic acid it would thus license one of the preservatives which encourages the same conditions in fruit and vegetable manufacture as were abolished in the meat-packing establishments by the national meat inspection law . In view of this position we appealed to President Roosevelt in the latter part of his term to appoint another committee to investigate the findings of the Remsen Board . This request was referred by President Roosevelt to Secre- tary of Agriculture Wilson , who reported back to the President against granting that request . Secretary Wilson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped from the platform President Emery angrily said : " This Referee Board was asked to come to this convention by the executive committee , and the insinuation that it is not to be given fair play comes with poor grace . The report went to the Secretary of Agriculture and he sent it back without comment . We took it that it did not meet his approval . Secretary Wilson asked a moment to answer , and said dryly : " You gentlemen up Mackinac way took it upon yourselves to condemn us down at Washington unheard , and so we figured you were not the material from which judges of the Supreme Court can be made . " R. W. Dunlap , of Ohio , is the only commissioner in the United States who is elected by the people instead of being appointed . Commissioner Dunlap was elected by 12,000 majority , and is one of the most popular officials in Ohio . ( From Denver Republican , Aug. 25 , 1909 . ) After apparently having been whipped upon every question brought up during the pure food convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposers of Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson 's policies developed a remarkable strength in the battle for the election of the association 's officers and put up one of the hottest contests ever seen during a convention meeting in this city . George L. Flanders , of New York , was elected president . New Orleans was chosen as the next place of meeting . The thirteenth annual convention of the National Association of State Food and Dairy Departments developed at its termination yesterday afternoon into a political struggle for the officers for next year , in which the Wilson , or administration , crowd won the presidency by three votes and lost all but one of the other officers . Had not Secretary Wilson been in Denver on the spot the administration would have been badly defeated not only on the election of the president but on many other questions as well . It was his political power and prestige as a member of the President 's Cabinet and his experience in political campaigns  | that won the support of the convention for the administration . He seconded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Charles Reed , of Cincinnati , the opponents of benzoate of soda and of the administration , were quite free to call Secretary Wilson 's crowd a political " ring " and a " clique . " Certainly it was largely by a political trick that the election of George L. Flanders , of New York , was secured and the defeat of A. C. Bird , of Michigan , was encompassed . George P. McCabe , Solicitor of the Department of Agriculture , and director of the battle for Secretary Wilson , was very busy just before the vote was taken and the votes upon the other officers looked as if he had made some advantageous trades for Flanders . This did not prevent Mr. McCabe 's defeat for the office of executive committeeman , A. N. Cook , of South Dakota , winning against him . Field Marshal McCabe became busy in his travels about the convention room , and when the vote was finally taken it was 57 to 54 in favor of Flanders , or the Wilson administration had only one state the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to second Flanders ' nomination personally operated greatly for the latter 's benefit , it is said . When the vote was taken on the other officers the Wilson slate was broken so badly that the pieces could not be found . ( Denver Republican , Aug. 28 , 1909 . ) After one of the stormiest sessions any convention of any kind ever had in Colorado , in which a great national or . ganization at times took the aspect of a bitter political ward meeting , and in which politics was played every moment of the time , Dr. George L. Flanders , of New York , Secretary Wilson 's candidate , yesterday was elected president of the Association of State and National Food and Dairy Departments , adding another point to the Secretary 's sweeping victory in the benzoate of soda battle . The Secretary of Agriculture led the fray in person , Flanders defeated A. C. Bird , State Dairy and Food Commissioner of Michigan , Wiley 's candidate , by a vote of 57 to 54 . Thirty-six states voted , each state having three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bird 18 , but the De .  | partment of Agriculture had three votes , and these three votes went to Flanders . The votes by states on the presidency was as follows Flanders ? Arizona , California , Colorado , District of ' olumbia , Georgia , Idaho , Illinois , Iowa , Louisiana , Massa , . husetts , Missouri , Nebraska , Nevada , New York , Oklahoma , Department of Agriculture , Utah , Washington and Wyoming , three votes each , total 19 ; total votes , 57 . Bird ? Connecticut , Florida , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Michigan , Minnesota , New Jersey , North Carolina , North Dakota , Ohio , South Dakota , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , Wisconsin , total 18 ; total votes , 54 . ( The Daily News , Denver , Colo. , Aug. 28 , 1909 . ) Thus ended that most turbulent exhibition of disreputable politics ever witnessed in a so-called scienfic convention in any country . It was the vote of the opartment of Agriculture that elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this diseditable affair . The Health Office of the District of olumbia through Dr. Woodward cast its three votes favor of the candidate of the food adulterators . The inent members of the Referee Board must have been azed at the character of their enthusiastic admirers . was an astounding apotheosis of the Unholy .  | The Attorney-General of the State of Indiana , Mr. James Bingham , desired to have testimony in favor of the State Board of Health from the Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry and from other employees of the Bureau who had taken an active part in the investigations of benzoic acid and benzoate of soda . A suit had been filed against the State of Indiana in the Federal Court before Judge Anderson on the ground that the ban placed on benzoated foods by the State Board of Health was unconstitutional . Mr. Bingham came to Washington for the purpose of securing permission from the Secretary of Agriculture for these officials to appear before the Federal Court in Indianapolis . The Secretary refused to grant the request of Mr. Bingham on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question and that it would not be in harmony with official etiquette for the employees of the Bureau of Chemistry to appear against the Remsen Board and their assistants and experts who were attending the trial in the interest of the complainant by the executive order and request of the Secretary of Agriculture . In order to secure this testimony Mr. Bingham found it necessary to remove the Federal Court from Indianapolis to Washington . When this was done the Solicitor of the De- partment of Agriculture on the request of the Chief of the Bureau made a ruling that the Federal Court had no right to issue a subpoena for attendance of the employees of the Bureau of Chemistry in the sense that they were compelled to attend and give testimony . He informed the members of the Bureau of Chemistry that it would not be a contempt of court if they should refuse to appear and give testimony on the summons unless they wanted to . I volunteered to give my testimony before the Federal Court . It begins on page 3,212 of the printed record and continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. W. D. Bigelow was called to the stand , after qualifying , in response to the first question asked him , he declined to answer on the ground that his testimony would be of a character not approved by the Department and he availed himself of the privilege given by the Solicitor of refusing to answer ( Page 3,693 of the Record of the Indiana Case ) . Mr. Bingham immediately carried the case to Justice Barnard of the District Supreme Court . Justice Barnard promptly ruled that the employees of the Department of Agriculture were compelled to give their testimony if subpoenaed by the Federal Court and that the statement made by the Solicitor that they were not thus compelled to testify was an error . Under this ruling Dr. Bigelow and other employees of the Bureau gave their testimony . It would not be proper to go into any extended explanations of the nature of this testimony given contrary to the opinion of the Solicitor . A. sufficient explanation of it is found in the fact that Judge Anderson of the Federal District Court of Indiana , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages was placed , with the summary by the master , promptly decided the case in favor of the State of Indiana . He said , in point of fact , that the  | btate 's rights in regard to the regulation of the sale of foods inside the State could not be questioned before the Federal Courts by citizens of other states . This recital shows plainly that although the privilege was denied the Bureau of Chemistry of bringing suit against anyone using benzoic acid , the employees were compelled to testify before the Federal Court . The users of these preservatives lost their case due largely to the testimony of the experts of the Bureau of Chemistry . Thus it appears as if the " big chemists " ? as the Secretary of Agriculture called them ? of ' the Remsen Board , when opposed by the " little chemists " of the Bureau of Chemistry , were defeated . This incident shows the danger of unwise greed . The right to use these preservatives was guaranteed to those manufacturers who felt like doing so by all the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should have been satisfied with that perversion of the law , but they were not . They determined to force benzoated goods upon the citizens of the State of Indiana . Fortunately they did not succeed . More fortunate still is the fact that one of the complainants against the State of Indiana was converted by the evidence adduced at the trial and abandoned the use of these preservatives . Still more fortunate is the fact that manufacturers in general , although this dispensation has now been in full force and authority for twenty-two years , have rarely indulged in the use of these preservatives . The goods manufactured under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture with these preservatives are distinctly inferior in quality and strength . The activities of the Remsen Board were not devoid of doubts as to their wisdom . In a letter dated Sep- tember 9 , 1909 , Dr. Remsen called attention to what might happen ( Page 879 , Moss Committee ) : My Dear Mr. Secretary : The Referee Board is going to be subjected to very severe criticism for testifying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is our desire that we should have from you a written request that we should give this testimony . I hope you will have no objection to sending this request to me . We are to testify at Seal Harbor , Me. , on the 17th . We are all glad to have been at Denver , and we all recognize the soundness of your judgment in asking us to go . Mr. Moss asked the Secretary to explain why the Remsen Board whose usefulness in so large a measure must depend on the respect and confidence which the public have for the high character of its membership should be subjected to severe criticism in order to assist in an effort by private corporations to overthrow the pure food laws of a sovereign state . To which Secretary Wilson replied that it was never in his mind to help overthrow the pure-food laws of a sovereign state , and that he would have been perfectly willing to have the Referee Board go where the people seemed to need information ; but as to an attack upon the State of Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman continued by asking him if he did not know that the suit filed by Curtice Brothers and Williams Brothers was inaugurated before the Referee Board had made its report on benzoate of soda ; to which he replied that he did not know anything about the nature of these proceedings . The Chairman of the committee continued by asking him if he had been requested by Attorney-General Bingham to permit Dr. Wiley to go to Indianapolis and testify in person in the Indiana case on behalf of the State of Indiana ; to which the Secretary responded that he did not think Dr. Wiley had ever asked him whether he could go to Indianapolis or not . Where- upon the chairman submitted a letter dated May 31 , 1910 , which the Hon. James Bingham had written the Secretary in regard to this matter . This letter is so pertinent that it is given in full : Hon. James Wilson , Secretary of Agriculture , Washington , D. C. Dear Mr. Secretary : I am in receipt of a letter from President Taft with copy of your letter attached in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am taking the liberty of writing you personally for the reason that I feel quite sure that you misapprehend the position of the State in this matter . You understand that Dr. Long , of Chicago , and Dr. Taylor , of California , both members of the Referee Board , attended in person here at Indianapolis and testified in this case . The master , who is hearing the evidence , is manifesting considerable interest in the testimony of the different witnesses and personally interrogates them , and it is my desire to give him this opportunity in the case of Dr. Wiley if possible . There is no attempt on my part to make it appear that the Government is not supporting the work of the Referee Board . On the other hand , whatever appears in the record to indicate that the Government has taken sufficient interest to sustain the decision of the board is there at my instance , since I personally asked the witnesses who have testified that they were testifying at your request , at whose request they were testifying in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and learning the facts with reference thereto before asking the questions . My position is that this question is one not capable of scientific demonstration , and this fact , I think , I have pretty thoroughly established by the testimony of the members of the Referee Board themselves . I think , however , that such a test was perfectly proper for whatever value it might have in the investigation of the injurious effects of sodium benzoate , but I feel very certain that the results of such an investigation are not conclusive . Indeed , I would not hesitate to try this question before you or any other fair man regardless of any conclusion you may have  | reached based upon the results of the work of the Referee Board . I attach more importance to an investigation made by Dr. Wiley than I do to that of the Referee Board , in view of his practical experience in such matters and especially in view of the experience of the corps of workers he must have had to assist him . In the case of the Referee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the investigation I have made I am satisfied that many of the results obtained , upon which the Referee Board bases its opinion , are unreliable . That the members of the Referee Board were conscientious and thoroughly capable scientists there can be no doubt , but their conclusion , eased upon a false premise due to inaccuracy in analytical work and want of regularity in habits of living by subjects , would , in my opinion , destroy the value of any such conclusion . In justice to you I can not go into detail , but the evidence is this case shows in some instances variations in duplicate analyses where the same articles were being analyzed under the same conditions , running from 15 per cent . to 1,800 per cent. , when every member of the Board testifies that there should not be a variation to exceed 2 per cent . I am very desirous of having Dr. Wiley appear in person in order that the master may personally interrogate him as to his premises most thoroughly , and I think you will readily appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no interest in this question except to have it decided right , and in this case we are not only availing ourselves of the results obtained by the Referee Board and Dr. Wiley , but of a vast number of other experiments , and especially of the results of practical demonstrations , and it occurs to me that when the evidence is concluded in this ease the court will be in a better position to reach an intelligent conclusion as to what the real effect of benzoate of soda is upon the human system when administered in food than the department was with nothing to depend upon but the result of a scientific investigation standing alone . Thanking you for your courtesy in offering to permit the deposition of Dr. Wiley to be taken , but hoping that you  | will see your way clear to permit him to attend in person . I remain , Very truly yours , ( Signed ) JAMES BINGHAM , Attorney-General . This letter of Mr. Bingham evidently removed every reason to justify , even in the smallest degree , the determined purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remson Board , to break down the Board of Health of Indiana which had placed its ban on food products containing benzoate of soda . Driven to the last extreme the Secretary sought to justify his action against the State of Indiana because the law of Indiana forbade the manufacture of beet sugar within the State ! In answer to the question of the chairman of the committee he said it was his purpose to help every state to the limit of his efforts , but when a state came out and said one could not use beet sugar it gave him pause . He continued as follows : We are making 500,000 tons of beet sugar every year in the United States . Indiana can make all the sugar she needs and supply half a dozen other states . But I have come up square against this law , and I do not want to break the laws of Indiana ; I would not for the world do that . It appears that William Brothers and Curtice Brothers alleged , in their suit to abolish the ruling of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other points in the Indiana law which were likewise unconstitutional , and among these was an expression in the law defining sugar as " cane sugar . " Of course every one knows that cane sugar is frequently used to designate sucrose . Indiana in her Statement for defense against the suit of Curtice Brothors used the following statement : These defendants , further answering , say that they deny that the use of beet sugar is prohibited by law in food  | products in the State of Indiana , or by any rule adopted by these answering defendants , as such State Board of Health of the State of Indiana . Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor , whose absence in Europe had prevented him from taking any active part in the investigations of benzoate of soda , was nevertheless very eager to appear against the State of Indiana in the benzoate trial . Under date of March 1 , 1910 , he made the following report to the Secretary of Agriculture : " I have just been giving testimony in the Indiana sodium benzoate case . I understand it was inferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Referee Board that I was not in agreement . I therefore testified , not as a member of the Board , but as an expert , pure and simple . Since last summer , being engaged on the sulphite question , I have been making a lot of control observations with the purpose of determining the normal variations in the metabolism of nitrogen , sulphur and phosphorus . These data , I believe the best in literature , I wish to use in my evidence , as they support strongly the position of our Board and are in contradiction with the work of Dr. Wiley on the action of benzoate . In a word , these investigations indicate that many of the reported deviations of Dr. Wiley are entirely with ' the range of those to be seen in normal persons on a norm diet , and show that the figures obtained by my colleague are normal figures for normal men . Have I your permi sion to offer these normal charts of normal metabolism the United States Circuit Court in the Indiana Case ? " To which the Secretary replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to Dr. Remsen in the followin words : " I enclose a very interesting letter from Prof. A. E. Tay for which please return to me . I shall leave this mat entirely with you . " Dr. Remsen in his reply to the secretary reco mended that he be given permission to use the da in the manner suggested . The Secretary left no ston unturned in his determined effort by all means , fai p 227 and foul , to secure a declaration from the Federal Court that the Indiana law was unconstitutional . ( Pages 367 , 368 , Moss Report . ) The testimony of Dr. A. E. Taylor in the Indiana ease is found on pages 2137 to 2207 of the printed testimony . He repeated in his testimony that he thought the data he had obtained were the best in iterature . Dr. Taylor in his experiments , which were of made , by the way , on the subject of benzoic acid , employed a plan greatly superior to that followed by e other members of the Referee Board . He emloyed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole force of the California State board of Health . He employed state chemists who ade all the examinations for fertilizers in the state . hen asked on cross-examination in regard to control f the diet of these trained men he stated that their diet was rigidly weighed and apportioned to them . hen attention was called to the fact that the other members of the Referee Board did not control either the quantity or the kind of diet , therefore the results which they obtained could not be comparable to his wn , he replied that he thought his own plan was betr but that the uncontrolled diet might lead to simir results . He was particularly opposed to the use of benzoate of soda in milk . On direct examination he was asked this question : Q. What are the reasons for not using it in milk ? A. For the simple reason that a , large amount of experice has taught us that the bad milk ought to be allowed to oil and that an absolutely harmless preservative , or even refrigeration , or pasteurization ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further ( page 2163 ) in regard to milk , he ys :  | A very minute trace of formaldehyde will keep milk for 48 hours but the tubercular and typhoidal bacilli will not be killed , and it is objectionable on that account . We object to anything that keeps milk without killing those germs , not being of a type to affect the common defects of sourness or souring . That is the reason I guarded myself absolutely in the use of this other substance . I would object to the use of benzoate of soda , of hydrogen peroxide , of the pasteurization of milk , this being the result . Evidently Dr. Taylor was not aware of the fact that pasteurization of milk at 145 ? for thirty minutes would destroy both typhoid and tubercular germs . The spores of germs require a much higher temperature for their destruction . By reading his testimony , the historian of the future will gather valuable information respecting the attitude of Dr. Taylor in general toward preservatives in foods and pasteurization . Dr. Taylor also was particularly opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in milk . H cites the attitude of Hammerstein , the Scandinavia chemist and physiologist . He asked him : Q. Do you use benzoate of soda ? A. No , sir . Q. Is there any law against it ? A. No . Q. Do you use salicylic acid ? A. Yes . Q. Why ? A. It is cheaper . Q. Is it injurious ? A. Possibly it is , but it is so easy we take the chance . FURTHER EXCERPTS FROM THE REPORT OF THE MO COMMITTEE AND THE RECORD OF THE INDIANA CASE Page 878 . THE CHAIRMAN , MR . Moss , of Indiana : Please tell me what sense you regarded the Indiana case as an importa one ?  | SECRETARY WILSON : Simply because it was in the Federal court , and it was taking up the question of whether the decision of the Referee Board was to be sustained . THE CHAIRMAN : That brings me to a question I want to ask you . At that time , what did you understand the issues of this suit at Indianapolis to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whether ? I do not know that I am entirely clear . I think it was an injunction asked by somebody . THE CHAIRMAN : It was by Curtice Bros. and Williams Bros. ? SECRETARY WILSON : Yes ; to require the board that you have there in Indiana to do something they wanted done . THE CHAIRMAN : We have a board of health ; yes , sir . SECRETARY WILSON : That is my recollection . It was something of that kind . But there was benzoate of soda on one Hide and opposition to it on the other . THE CHAIRMAN : Would you mind telling us where you obtained that information ? SECRETARY WILSON : Oh , I could not do that ; I do not remember . THE CHAIRMAN : I have the original complaint here , and your information was so badly apart from what the real issues were that I wanted to find out your source of information . Page 882 . THE CHAIRMAN : YOU did request , both orally and in writing , the members of the Referee Board to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little different basis . THE CHAIRMAN : As the Indiana law expressly permits the sale of food products which are guaranteed under the provisions of the pure food law , how can the defense of this suit by the State or any of its agents be considered as an attack on the decision of the Referee Board ? SECRETARY WILSON : That is an academic question , I think , Mr. Chairman . THE CHAIRMAN : YOU have stated that Dr. Robison in appearing to testify there was opposing your policy ? SECRETARY WILSON : He was a subordinate of the department . THE CHAIRMAN : The question is that inasmuch as the In- diana law expressly permits the sale in Indiana of any food product guaranteed under the pure food law of your department , when you guarantee it , how can a defense against a suit to strike down that law be considered an attack upon the Referee Board ? ( There is no apparent answer to this question , save the following . ) Page 883 . SECRETARY WILSON : I would not be known to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and besides , Mr. Chairman , I find in looking over my behavior toward Indiana that I have a great lot of scientists there , and it might be wise for me to get them back out of there . I have men from nearly all our scientific bureaus there , helping the State of Indiana along these scientific lines , and cooperating with them Pages 31-33-Indiana Record . Q. Well , there was a meeting , was n't there , of chemists , Doctor , recently , out at Denver , Colo. , where a great number of scientific men congregated , was n't there ? A. There was no doubt about it . Q. And you had an election out there at which benzoate of soda was the candidate , did n't you ? A. I do n't know . I had nothing to do with the election . I was n't a member of the association . I was present as an interested spectator , but not a member of the association , had no vote . Q. Now the fact is that of late there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by scientific men throughout the country , has n't there , Doctor ? A. Apparently . I am out of that . I am not at all a part of the excitement . Q. And were you present when the vote was finally taken at Denver on the question ? A. Which vote do you mean ? Q. On the harmfulness of benzoate of soda , the adoption of the resolution ? not vote , but resolution . A. I was present , yes , sir , the resolution approving the action of the board , the report of the board . They approved .  | Q. By what vote ? A. That is too much for me ? 57 to 42 , maybe , I do n't remember exactly what it was ; in the fifties for one and forties for the other ; fifty-odd in favor and forty-odd against ; I could n't remember that , I am sure ; I am near the truth . Q. Now in the talks that you had with the Secretary of Agriculture , did you learn that the plaintiffs , Curtice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. I do not remember that I ever heard them mentioned by the Secretary of Agriculture . Q. When did you first learn that the plaintiffs were interested in this question , Doctor ? A. In this ? you mean in this particular suit ? Q. No , in this question as to whether benzoate of soda as harmful . A. Oh , I remember . I remember it was at a meeting , a ring we gave , our Referee Board gave in New York betore we began our investigation . We sent word to those who were interested in the general problem , not only those who use benzoate but those who do not use benzoate , informing them that we would like to get such information as possible to aid us in our work . And they were represented by a number of large manufacturing interests who appeared before us to state their problems ; mind you , they were not those who use benzoate alone but those who do not use it . We felt that it ss only fair to hear what they had to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sides ? there are sides , Snquestionably , I recognize it . And my recollection is that this is the first that I ever heard of these firms , except so tar as I had become familiar with them through labels that everybody has seen . Q. Well , now , have you met them since that time ? A. Only as ? except at Denver I saw these gentlemen , at Denver ; saw them in passing . I had very little to say to them I think they almost accused me of discourtesy . Q. Did the manufacturers appear out at the Denver convention ? A. These gentlemen were there ? I do not remember , I do not know them sufficiently well to say . Q. Well , when you had this hearing of the Referee Board dl  | at which you heard both sides , did Dr. Wiley appear at the hearing ? A. No . Q. Was he invited ? ( A. No . It was restricted to those who used benzoate of soda . Q. I understood you to say that you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ? but who either use or do not use it , but who are interested in it from the manufacturing point of view , that is what I meant . Q. You mean as confined to manufacturers ? A. Oh , yes , wholly . Q. Now , you also stated that there had been a world of work on the physiological effect of benzoate of soda on the human system . A. That is a question which has perhaps not been very fully investigated , and yet I recall in this connection an investigation which came to my notice when I was a very young man . I went to Gottingen in 1868 . I carried a letter to a distinguished physiologist who was there , Professor Meissner . He had just completed an elaborate series of experiments of the effect of benzoic acid on the human organism . Mr. Charles U. Shepard , an American student , took large doses of benzoic acid , much larger than the quantities that have been used in our experiments . Those large quantities left no permanent effects . Q. Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original research upon the effect of benzoic acid or benzoate of soda upon the human system are referred to in that report , in the bibliography . A. All the important ones . CROSS EXAMINATION OF DR . REMSEN Q. This experiment of Dr. Meissner , about which you have testified is that experiment which is reviewed in the bibliography ? A. It is . Q. I read from exhibit 1 , in which this experiment is re ? ferred to as follows :  | There is no hippuric acid or benzoic acid in the blood of animals which excrete hippuric acid abundantly in the urine . According to the authors ' experiments on man , ingestion of 7.6 grams of benzoic acid as sodium salt in solution after breakfast was followed suddenly , 30 minutes later , by nausea and vomiting . When 5.7 grams were taken after breakfast there was vehement vomiting after about 35 minutes . When vigorous exercise was taken after the same doze ( 5.7 grams ) there was some nausea , but no vomiting . The nausea can be made to disappear by violent exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams , when the subject was kept quiet in a warm room there was no nausea or vomiting . A stronger and heavier person repeatedly took 7.6 grams without these symptoms . The authors conclude from their experiments on animals that the kidney is the only organ where benzoic acid is normally transformed into hippuric acid . When 2 grams of benzoic acid per day were fed to a rabbit during 3 clays there was no decrease in urea output . In a dog of 12 to 13 kilograms , 8 grams of benzoic acid given in solution per os caused vomiting . Later 8 grams were given twice a day as dry powder packed in meat . There was apparently no decrease in urea . After several days a toxic effect was noted ? difficulty in urinating , spasm , attack of rage , attempts to bite , foam at mouth . Benzoic acid was continued 2 days more and the attacks recurred . Appetite remained good . Convulsions occurred the day after the benzoic was stopped , and then they ceased . Similar attacks were observed in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The authors conclude that the continued administration of large amounts of benzoic acid is not without danger , although Keller took 2 grams per day for some time without feeling any ill effects . Hippuric acid is formed from benzoic acid in all animals . Authors conclude that in herbiverous animals the excretion of hippuric acid is dependent on the cuticular substance of plants ingested . The small amount in normal human urine probably derives its origin from metabolism products . Q. Is that a correct review of ? that experiment as you understood it , Doctor ?  | A. Of course I can not positively say that these details are correct , but I believe them to be correct . ( Page 45 and page 46 . ) In the cross examination of Dr. Remsen it was brought out that the reason young men were selected was because they would show the greatest resistance to any pathological effects that were probably produced . Dr. Remsen stated that he did not think the age of the subject would have much to do with the case and to the question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resistance that could be found in the human system he said yes . Nevertheless he made an answer to the following question : " And if there was a tendency of benzoate of soda or sodium benzoate in small quantities to affect the system , it would appear less in a test of young men than it would upon any other character of subjects that you could select , would n't it ? " A. " I am not sure of that . " ( Page 26 . ) On Page 27 Dr. Remsen was asked what are the variations in temperature , what variations in pulse , what variations in the specific gravity of urine , what variations are there in the volume of urine in normal health . Dr. Remsen answered : Those matters are not at all within my ken . I am not an expert in those lines , I have never claimed to be . My medical training is so far remote that I confess that that kind of information is not at my fingers ' ends . Page 30 . Q. Well , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government ? A. Dr. Wiley , I suppose . Q. Were you in touch with him ? A. I had nothing to do with him , sir ; I did n't see him about it at all . Q. Well , he is quite an eminent chemist , is he not ? A. He is very well-known . I may say that he is an eminent chemist . Yes .  | Q. Now he has been devoting a great deal of time to the study of this question , the effect of benzoate of soda upon food products , has he not ? A. Some time , I do n't know about a great deal . Q. Do n't you know that he made an investigation on this subject and got out a report on it ? A. He had the investigation made by others . He did n't do it himself . Q. Well , was he as close in touch with his job as you was in yours ? A. I do n't know the facts , but I know the work was carried out by his assistants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. Well , now , Dr. Wiley reached the conclusion as a result of his investigation to which I have referred that benzoate of soda was harmful when used in foods in what you denominate " small quantities " did n't he ? A. Yes , sir . Q. And all over the country there are scientific men who have been studying this question who agree with Dr. Wiley upon that question , do they not ? A. I do n't know that scientific men all over the country have been studying that question in any scientific way . We have no records of experiments . I wo n't say there are none , but there are very few , if any , and so far as I understand the situation these gentlemen who agree with Dr. Wiley simply agree with him , accept his opinion . Page 32 . Q. Well , when you had this hearing of the Referee Board , at which you heard both sides , did Dr. Wiley appear at that hearing ? A. No . Q. Was he invited ? A. No . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not use it but who are interested in it from the manufacturing point of view ; that is what I meant . Page 35 . Q. Well , do you approve of the result that Dr. Wiley got in investigating this question . A. I ca n't answer that question . I do n't like to .  | Q. Well , I would like to have you do it . A. I do not . Or I should rather put it in this way , that our Board does not . Q. That is to say you reached a different conclusion from Dr. Wiley. ? That is what you mean to say ? A. Yes , sir . Q. You are not criticizing his work . A. Not at all . Q. But you say you approve the work of an expert because it is done by an expert ? A. Yes . Q. Dr. Wiley is an expert , is n't he ? A. Not in physiological work . Q. You think he has had no experience in physiological work ? A. I am unable to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am very sorry to testify in this way but you have pushed me to it . Q. I understand that you yourself are not a physiologic chemist . A. No , I am not . Q. So that is the opinion of one non-physiological chemist upon another ? A. Hardly . My opinion is based upon my experience with a board of men who are thoroughly familiar with that kind of work . Q. What peculiar knowledge now would a chemist have to have in order to conduct an investigation of this kind ? A. He would have to be an expert in physiological work , physiological chemist is really what you would want , a pharmacologist is a form of physiological chemist , a man who studies the effects of substances upon the system , but in order to judge the effects he must have physiological knowledge and must bring that into play at every step . Q. Now you are not a pharmacologist , I believe you cal it , is that correct ? A. That is the name ; I am not a pharmacologist . Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Q. And it is necessary to have both these elements of edu- cation in order to be able to conduct properly this sort of investigation . A. Undoubtedly . Q. Well , if it is necessary that we shall have a pharmacologist and a physiological chemist and you are neither , is n't it a fact that your opinion is influenced by the conclusions reached by those who are pharmacologists and physiological chemists who are on the Board ? I desire at this point to introduce a statement in regard to my personal attention to the work carried on in the Bureau of Chemistry in studying the effect of small quantities of benzoic acid and benzoate of soda on the health of the young men who were undergoing these experiments . I may say that the Referee Board were not the authors of the plan of experiment which they followed . It was copied directly from the plan adopted by the Bureau of Chemistry in all of these investigations , with this exception . All foods used were carefully analyzed by the Bureau of Chemistry , very few foods were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention for five years to all the details of this work . During the winters I rose long before daylight , even before the street cars were running and walked two miles to my laboratory , which I reached by seven o'clock . I supervised the preparation of the breakfast , I weighed , with assistance of others , every article of food which was administered , I supervised the actual analyses of these foods in the laboratory , I studied the condition of the young men every day as a medical man . I saw that their excreta , solid and liquid , were collected and delivered to the laboratory . I dined with the young men except that I did not take the foods to which the preservatives were added . I felt that my continued good health would be at stake if I did , but I ate the same kinds of foods that they ate otherwise . When nine o'clock  | came I went to my office and performed the ordinary duties connected therewith until luncheon time . I then went into the kitchen and supervised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon was over I again went to my duties as Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry . At five o'clock I again went back into the kitchen and supervised the preparation of dinner . I remained in the kitchen and dining room and dined with the young men at dinner . By seven o'clock the dinner was over . This was the routine which I followed for five years winter and summer except at such times as I was called away from Washington . When I was called out of town , Dr. W. D. Bigelow , my first assistant , took my place as supervisor of the experimental work ; yet Dr. Remsen without making any effort to learn the truth about the matter said I took no part in this work , that I was not a physiological chemist . In 1910 I was awarded the Elliot Cresson medal of the Franklin Institute for leading work in physiological and agricultural chemistry . This medal was given me for inaugurating the most extensive investigations ever undertaken in this country in improving the valuable properties of plants . I inaugurated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kansas , experiments in improving the quantity and quality of sorghum for sugar-making purposes carried over a period of many years in which the percentage of sucrose In sorghum was raised from nine to fourteen per cent . These experiments were published in numerous bulletins of the Department of Agriculture extending over a period of many years . In like manner I inaugurated and carried into effect a work extending over several years of ascertaining the factors which would produce the best quality of sugar beet in the  | United States . The results were published in the bulletins of the Bureau of Chemistry and enabled the manufacturers who were intending to go into the sugar-beet industry to locate their plants in those areas in which the best sugar beets were grown . In all some five hundred thousand analyses of sugar beets grown under similar conditions with the same seeds were made . Following this physiological chemical work I originated and carried into effect a series of experiments extending from Maine to Florida of the factors which produce the largest amount of sugar in sweet corn . These results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Department of Agriculture . It was for these far-reaching investigations of physiological chemical problems , and for similar work in studying the effects of preservatives and coloring matters on health , that the directors of the Franklin Institute awarded me the Elliot Cresson medal . The gold medal bears this inscription : For Distinguished Leading and Directive Work in Agricultural and Physiological Chemistry , 1910 Yet Dr. Remsen under oath said I was not a physiological chemist . Pages 112 to 116-Indiana Record . Q. As a matter of fact , you know , do n't you , Doctor , that the very opposite effect to which you testified has been found by other eminent scientists with reference to some of these subjects that you have testified about even in the administration of small doses of benzoate ? A. Well , I do n't believe that I can agree to that . Q. Have you not examined Dr. Wiley 's report of his in-vestigation ? A. I have .  | Q. Well , do you not know that he so found ? A. I do . Q. And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sodium benzoate Q. Well , I know ? what official position does he hold ? A. He is chief of the bureau of chemistry of the Depart ment of Agriculture . Q. What Government ? A. The United States Government . Q. That is rather a responsible position ? A. Very . Q. And Doctor Wiley has occupied that position for many years , has he not ? A. I believe he has . Q. And he conducted quite an extensive investigation on this subject , did he not ? A. I believe that he did . Q. You know , too , do n't you , Doctor , that a number of eminent scientists who have read and studied the report that was published of the work of the so-called Referee Board have reached different conclusions from the board as to the effect of benzoate of soda in foods , even based on the facts included in those published reports , do n't you ? A. I have been told that there has been criticism of the report of the Referee Board , but I have felt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , or wholly , from such sources as lead me not to give great confidence , to place great confidence in those results or in those opinions I should say ? they are not results ? opinions . In general I would say that that is my attitude . Q. Well , you know that Dr. Wiley has criticized this re port and draws a different conclusion from what the Board did from the facts that are published in the report , do you not ? A. I think so . Dr. Wiley told me so himself the other day when he talked with me . Q. Now , you know Dr. Reed of Cincinnati , do you ? A. I had that pleasure at Denver . Q. He is an ex-president of the American Medical Association , is he not ?  | A. I do n't know that of my own knowledge . I will have to answer that on some kind of hearsay . Q. Well , he is an eminent physician , is he not , and a scientist ? A. I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have been told that he was a good gynecologist . Q. Well , do you know what his training is , Doctor ? A. No , I ca n't say that I do . That is a matter of hearsay . Q. You know that he reaches a different conclusion from what the board did ? A. I do . Q. I did n't get my question in ? you know he reaches a different conclusion from what the board did as to the effect of administering benzoate of soda in the foods , based on the facts published in the report of the board , do you not ? A. I had a different idea of what he bases his views on . Q. You know that he does not agree with the conclusions of the board , do you not ? A. I infer that . Q. Now there was some sort of an association of chemists held at Denver recently , was n't there , Doctor ? A. I think that the association contained some chemists . Whether they are all chemists or not , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that association ? A. That is the ? I ought to remember on account of the squabble over the Mississippi , but I have forgotten ? that is the National Pure Food and Dairy Association ? no , that is n't right ? The Association of State and National Food and Dairy Departments ? I think that is what it is . Q. Now that is made up of people who are connected with the study of foods , is it not ? A. Certain aspects . Q. Study and manufacture of foods ? A. Certain aspects of the study of foods . Q. You were present at that association ? A. I was present . Q. Did you address the association ? A. Well , I spoke to the association . Q. What was the subject of your address ? A. It had to do with the action of sodium benzoate on the human organism .  | Q. Did you discuss the work of the Referee Board in that connection any ? A. I referred to it , but I particularly referred to the work done in my laboratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Referee Board there ? A. They were all there . Q. Did any of the other members address that meeting ? A. They all spoke except Dr. Taylor . Q. What were the subjects of their addresses ? A. The same general topic , I should say . Q. That you discussed ? A. Well , for their own reports ? they did for their reports what I did for mine . Q. And were there any other addresses delivered there on this subject of the use of benzoate of soda in foods ? A. Well , I suppose that the chairman 's address might be so regarded and Dr. Reed 's address ; they contained reference to it . Q. Who was the chairman ? A. Mr. or Dr. Emery ? Mr. Emery . Q. Now there was some sort of a report passed upon there by that association with reference to this effect of benzoate of soda upon the human system as administered in the food , and also as to the result of all investigations made on that subject up to the date of that association , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that I have in mind probably the same report that you have in mind , but I am not sure . Q. And that report that was made to the association was a report made by a committee of eleven men , was it not ? A. I believe that there was a committee which reported . Q. I will ask you now if that committee was not composed of chemists entirely ? A. I do n't know , sir ; I do n't think that I had heard the name of any one of the number . Q. And you know that it was reported there by that committee that the investigation of that subject had not been carried to an extent sufficient to determine the question as to whether the use of benzoate of soda in food was or was not injurious to the human system ? do you not ?  | A. I have only a very vague recollection of what was said in the report . Q. You heard the report discussed , did you ? A. I think that I did . My impression is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further investigations . That is my recollection of it . Q. You do know , do n't you , Doctor , that there is now , and has been , a diversity of opinion among scientists upon this very question ? A. Which question , may I ask ? Q. The question as to whether or not the administration of benzoate of soda in foods to the human being is injurious to the human system . A. I know that there has been a diversity of opinion about that . Q. And you know , too , that this diversity of opinion has existed since the Referee Board report was published , do you not ? A. Well , you mean it has existed in spite of the publication , or do you mean that it was initiated then ? MR . BINGHAM : Listen to the question , Doctor ; I think it will explain itself . A. Well , I would n't say since ; it existed before . Q. Well , you know that scientists have criticised it since it was published , do you not , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with you on the question ? A. I have never heard any adverse opinion of the report of the Referee Board from any person that I would class as a scientist . Q. How do you class Dr. Wiley ? A. Well , I do n't know Dr. Wiley very well , and I find it is a rather difficult task to class him . I do n't know what you expect of me . Pages 160-161 . Q. One more question as to Dr. Lucas . ( Dr. Lucas was one of Herter 's squad . ) It is a fact , is it not . Doctor , that Dr. Lucas disagreed with you as to the result of the injurious effect of the use of benzoate of soda in food in small quan-tities ? A. I do not know very accurately what Dr. Lucas ' views are , but I know he has done some work particularly on the  | action of benzoic acid and I judge from the paper that I heard read at Denver that his views are in some respects at least different from mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 165 . Q. Did you know that the Department of Agriculture of the United States Government stood ready to furnish this Referee Board with everything at its command that was necessary for making this experiment that is under consideration ? A. I heard that stated by the President of the United States and by the Secretary of Agriculture more than once . Q. Did you know that the United States Government had a chemical laboratory in the City of New York ? A. I did not . Q. Did you not learn from the Department that it had numerous analytical chemists in its employ at the time and before this experiment was begun , in the City of New York ? A. I was not aware of that fact . Q. Well , you did know that it had a Department of Chem-istry ? A. I did . Q. And you knew , too , that that department was engaged in the administration of pure food laws of the United States , did n't you ? A. So I had heard . Q. And you knew that it had a corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly engaged in the work of analyzing foods and their analytical testing , did you not ? A. I assumed that to be the case . Q. How did it come that you did not secure your analytical chemists and men for doing the routine work from the force of the Department of Agriculture ? A. Because it was intimated to me that it was the desire of the Department of Agriculture and by the President of the United States that in the investigation carried on by me I should be free to use my judgment as to all points connected with the matter of personnel in my laboratory . Q. Why was it that you preferred to select such men as Dr. Lucas and Dr. Ringer and Mr. O'Brien and Dr. Harvey , some of whom at least are neither graduates or chemists and who , according to your own statement , would need instruction , rather than those experienced men in the Department  | of Agriculture who are regularly engaged in that class of work ? A. It never occurred to me that they would be available , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partly for the reason that it never occurred to me that men such as I wanted would be willing to come from the I ) epartment of Agriculture . We canvassed the situation with regard to the universities particularly and if I had known there was a branch department of the Department of Agriculture in New York I certainly should have applied to them . Pages 176-177 . Q. Well , you were impressed at that time , were you not , with the fact that this expenditure of time and money was nut being made as a matter of idle curiosity , but for the purpose of opening the door , if possible , to the use of benzoate of soda for such purpose ? A. I did not hear the case stated so fully nor so eloquently as that , but I got the impression that the manufacturers felt that if they had to give up benzoate of soda ? or at least that some of them felt that if they had to give up benzoate of soda - they would either have to be shown some other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put to financial loss . Page 178 . Q. Who was it that said that this benzoate of soda question was a pressing question ? A. I do not know that anybody said that it was a pressing question ; I may have said it myself . Q. How did you get the impression that that was a pressing question ? A. Well , I said that there were two or three questions , the sulphite question , the benzoate question , the saccharine quest ion , that it was important to act on . The President wanted the saccharine question investigated . Q. Who was it that gave you to understand that these two subjects were the most important ? A. I am unable to answer that question . Q. Did you not get the idea that these questions were pressing because they involved large interests ? A. Yes , I did .  | Q. Yes , I know ; but getting this settled was desired owing to the fact that large interests were involved ? A. That was the general impression of the board . Q. You knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some sort of a chemical preservative , did you not ? A. I knew from the meeting of the manufacturers to which I have referred that many of them desired either to be permitted to continue to use benzoate of soda or requested a substitute for it , and I understood , principally from Or . Taylor , that the question was a very live one in the west : While writing these memoirs I was told that one of the principals in the Indiana case , namely Walter TI . Williams of Detroit , was convinced by the evidence brought before the Federal Court that he was wrong in believing that benzoate of soda should be used in food products . Probably the adverse decisions of Judge Anderson and the Circuit Court of Appeals in confirming it strengthened Mr. Williams ' opinion in regard to the platter . In order to be certain about this matter I addressed a letter to Walter H. Williams on May 7 , 1927 , from which I quote : In some way I have received the impression that the Williams Brothers withdrew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court . They had become convinced that the use of benzoate of soda was either unnecessary or injurious and had taken the position that they could put up their catsup just as well or better without it than they could with it . Before I submit this statement in my autobiography to the printer I should be glad to hear from you in regard to this matter . To this I received a reply under date of May 31 , 1927 . I quote the following , with Mr. Williams ' permission : Your remembrance of the Indiana benzoate case is substantially correct . The Williams Brothers of Detroit did  | join with Curtice Brothers of Rochester , New York , in seeking a Federal Court order in an endeavor to restrain the Health Department of Indiana from enforcing its ruling in regard to the use of benzoate of soda as a preservative in food products . The Williams Brothers Company later came to believe that benzoate , or any other preservative was entirely unnecessary in such food products as ketchup , sweet pickles , preserves , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only did Williams Brothers find that a preservative such as benzoate was unnecessary , but were convinced that permission to use it allowed food manufacturers to be very careless in their methods of manufacture . The writer well remembers the hearing before committees of both houses of Congress and the strong opposition food manufacturers presented against the passage of the national food and drugs act . At that time we all believed we were absolutely and honestly right in our contention , but most of us have since found that we were wrong , and that working under proper factory methods and conditions we can comply with all regulations called for by the national food and drugs act and turn out much better products than under the slip-shod methods generally used before the passage of the act . In the early days of enforcement many of us thought , Dr. Wiley , that you were too radical in your ideas of pure food and felt that you were doing harm to our industry . When I look back over the changes that have come to the food industry during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better that have come to our methods and our products , I wonder why we were all so blindly asleep as we were and why , much sooner than we did , we did not welcome and follow your teaching . I am glad , indeed , Dr. Wiley , that this correspondence between us has started so that I am able to tell you what I have many times said to my friends and competitors in the industry , that Dr. Wiley was many years ahead of us in his thoughts and we had been terribly slow in awakening to the possibilities of pure food manufacture . We should bear in mind that through the illegal creation of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection
