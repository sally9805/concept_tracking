A Czechoslovak spy was arrested in Hungary last week . The incident emptied summer hotels , stopped trains , brought talk of war . <P> The ascertainable facts might have seemed thin in any place but Central Europe . But that part of the world is as full of spies as of flies . Only last fortnight Prague 's Nrodni Politika , commenting absently on the spy situation , observed with interest that Russian spies seemed to be unusually numerous this year . <P> Last week 's episode was this : <P> One Vincent Pecha , Czech railway ticket-agent , was making a comfortable meal of fried veal and beer in the station restaurant at Hidas Nmeti , Hungarian frontier town . <P> Entered some Hungarian gendarmes with drawn pistols , forced Vincent Pecha to throw up his hands , searched him , clapped gyves upon his wrists . In the room next to the station restaurant " a secret military document " was found . Using suitable pressure , the Hungarians got Pecha to admit having hidden it . <P> Spy or ticket-taker , Vincent Pecha was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arrest , Czechoslovak officials halted the Budapest-Kassa train service . Not to be outdone , Hungarian vacationists left Czechoslovak resorts , cancelled reservations at Tatra and Karlsbad , prepared to drink their August sulphur water in Germany instead . Prague newspapers cried for further reprisals to obtain the release of Pecha , talked headily of war . Hungarian authorities , convinced of Pecha 's guilt , did nothing but hold their prisoner , prepared to try him . <P> Prague 's interest in the Pecha incident was modified during the week by the trial and sentence , in Prague , of another Czech spy-a Czech working against his own country . Capt . Jaroslaf Falout , Czechoslovak general staff officer , carelessly left a suitcase in the cabin of a Prague-Berlin airplane . The contents of the suitcase were so interesting that he was immediately arrested , charged with being a German agent , charged also with the more lucrative , more prosaic crime of forging officers ' leave permits . <P> The Czech military court sentenced Falout to 19 years ' imprisonment with the following embroideries : <P> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in solitary confinement . <P> 2 ) One day each month , to live on bread and water. * <P> 3 ) Each Sept. 28 to be spent in a dark cell . <P> *Anniversary of the death of Saint Venclaus ( Bohemia 's " good King Wenceslas " ) , to be nationally celebrated this year as his millennium .
