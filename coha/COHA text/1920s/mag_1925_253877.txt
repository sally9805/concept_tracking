The First National Bank of New York City was founded in 1863 with capital stock of a par value of $200,000 . This capital has been gradually increased to 100,000 shares of $100 par value , or $10,000,000 altogether . <P> But those figures do not begin to tell the remarkable story of the bank 's progress and growth under Mr. George F. Baker 's long and skilful guidance . The First National is one of the largest financial institutions in the country , and also one of the most thoroughly undercapitalized . Its dividends have long climbed nearer and nearer to par value of its shares . Now , by declaring a 25% quarterly dividend , the First National has been put , temporarily at least , on a 100% dividend basis , where disbursements to stockholders are each year equal to the entire nominal capitalization of the institution . As a result , while par of First National shares is still only $100 , the market price is now about $2,600 apiece . <P> Earnings of the First National in 1924 were estimated at $16,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First National stock goes a share of its subsidiary , the First Security Corporation-long one of the leading factors in the security underwriting business of New York City . What proportion of earnings comes from the bank proper , and what proportion from the subsidiary , is known only to Mr. Baker . And , on this subject at least , the veteran banker still deserves his cognomen : " The Sphinx of Wall St. "
