Overstep <P> Sirs : <P> Now you have gone too far . Editorial stunts ( and I speak from an experience of more than 35 years in active newspaper work ) can be carried beyond what is pleasing . TIME 'S new department of FASHIONS is just such an overstep . You know why without my going any further : the " formula . " <P> Do n't bear down on the " formula " idea so hard . It will make your magazine too tricky , I warn you . See how monotonous those Fashion pages are now when you read them over : ' The Idea , the Motive , the Story . The Idea , the Motive , the Story . The Idea , the Motive , the Story . " I was so tired that I had to stop in the middle , go off to p. 26 for a little relief and come back later to finish . <P> Good intentions deserve good counsel . Mine to you is to cut out this latest FASHION department , " formula " and all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheated <P> Sirs : Your new FASHIONS department TIME , Nov. 14 cheats my intelligence , time and purse . I am a businessman ( real estate ) . <P> I pay $5 a year for TIME . I have done three years in succession , besides paying for six other subscriptions as Christmas presents to friends . I read the magazine with the utmost concentration , trying to fix in my memory , during two hours reading each week , the thousands of facts you furnish me in each issue . The mental effort , time and money I have always considered well invested . <P> Now comes your silly , insipid FASHIONS . <P> It steals 3% columns from my TIME ( 5% of the current number ) . And for what good ? To babble about eight trivial topics . Let me criticize them specifically . But first let me praise the pattern of each article . Your summarizing The Idea , The Motive and The Story is as compact an editing method as I can imagine . That is truly TIME 'S selling point and success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen gear is worth at the most a footnote to an ART article on art-in-the-home or a BUSINESS article on department store operations . And are you sure that Macy 's and Wanamaker 's were the first to sell them ? For years I have seen them in " gift shoppes " run by loathsome women with tricky ideas . <P> " Wedding : " The article is written most vapidly and gives no names or other authority . That is damnable in TIME . <P> " Furniture : " Hollow and affected is Fur niture Salesman Frankl 's explanation and gloss for kitchenet apartment furniture . You , TIME , should have milked down his bloated phrases and said prosaically : " Salesman Frankl sells **29;12424;TOOLONG . It is acceptable and esthetic because it fits appropriately those pinched crannies of costly New York apart ments . " Mr. Frankl 's initials made me laugh . His balderdash resembles that of that other P. T. - Barnum . <P> " Rain Coats : " Here are facts , but trivial . ' T would have been better to have reported them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " Hotel Service : " Free buttonhole flowers are corrupters of public morals . Men who wear buttonhole flowers are not greatly to be admired . Worse , you disseminate another trick for use of those hotel parasites , the lavatory men .
