txt When the heirs of Lord Brassey received $600,000 for 400,000 acres of land in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan they were so delighted with the trade that they paid C. W. Wright , an employe of long service , the sum of 660.000 lust as a bonus . Henry Ford , the modern Herod of the West , paid $3,000,000 it is said for the same property a few weeks later and Otto Davidson , mining expert and intimate friend of Mr. Ford , stepped up another notch in the esteem of the Michigan motor man who promises to take a place among the famous characters in the world 's history . Hon. Chase S. Osborn , former governor and also a candidate for United States Senate at the same time Mr. Ford and Mr. Newberry were bidding for the support of the people of Michigan , thought out the trade and though it is supposed that he made a fair commission , the amount . is still a secret . The story is interesting and besides carrying timber lands , iron mines , ships , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " pots of gold " so absolutely essential in all " plays " which have to do with the achievements and vanities of men . In view of the fact that Henry Ford is perhaps the most widely advertised ' man in the world and that his fortune is estimated anywhere from $100,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 , it is only natural that all kinds of stories would be told , many of which are quite as unreliable as some of Mr. Ford 's theories are impracticable , and which , by the way , make him such a curious creature . UNIONS ARE UNIONS Not all of the incidents recited about Mr. Ford are exaggerated or untrue . When the University students and Alumni of " Michigan , " were raising a fund with which to build their Union Assembly building , one of Detroit 's editors was asked to solicit Mr. Ford . After an interview extending over several minutes the editor was forced to retire without a subscription , because he could I not convince Mr. Ford that the " Union " was not a bad I title for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not believe in unions ; notwithstanding the repeated assurance upon the part of the editor that he was not soliciting for a Labor Union , but a Building , where the students might assemble , entertain their friends and relatives ; hold ban- I quets and encourage special education which only an edi7 five of this kind would afford . ? I ANCIENT HISTORY Another incident indicating Mr. Ford 's notions toward history was a short conversation with a famous cartoonist in which Mr. Ford was asked if Bismarck 's forecasts of the future were not proof of a concerted and deliberate plan for war upon the part of Germany ? To which Mr. Ford answered that he had never bothered with ancient history and consequently could not decide . In a statement to E. A. Summers , former Michigan chairman of the Military Training Camps ' Association of the United States , Mr. Ford said : " A man can steal from rile and I will keep him in my employ . If he goes to a training camp I will fire him . " AUTOMOBILES FROM THE GROUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credited in the final conclusion of the " Ford idea , " to " dig automobiles out of the ground direct " and thereby eliminate all middle men 's profit , is of course just as much of a speculation as the ability of Mr. Osborn to think out the plan and sell it to a customer whom he knew could buy . At ' any rate " extraordinary vision " was one of the vital essentials together with the proper selection of principals and speakers as Mr. Osborn knew . ' Salesmen who can suggest to a customer what to buy and at the same time make the customer think that the ideas are creations of his own mind are the best salesmen . In any event Mr. Ford decided to buy the land from which he could take his own timber for his own car bodies . Also from which he could dig his own ore . He could then build his own ships to sail to his own land , load his own ore from his own mine , carry it to his own docks 3n Detrtit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own mills , and finish it up in his own factory . Not only that , he could own his own railroad , hire his own engineers and conductors , dispatch his own trains , haul his own coal , ds ! away with railroad presidents and general managers , etc. , etc . If there were any profits in any of these various en- I terprises he could just as well have them all . Thus he owns the Detroit Toledo &; Ironton Railroad , 400,000 acres of timber and iron lands , the largest single unit smelter in the world and is getting ready to literally " dig automobiles out of the earth . " THOSE ORE LA %DS The land deal was made after Mr. Osborn had se- , cured an option from the Brassey estate on 22,000 shares ' of the Michigan Land &; Iron Co . There were 4,000 shares owned in Boston and though most of these shares had lain in safety boxes so /one ; as to have been almost forgotten , came , there was thor ** which ! usually raises value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to-another ; and before the 4,000 shares were . finally endorsed over to Mr. Osborn , several hundred thousand dollars were tied in the deal . Mr. Otto Davidson was the gentleman selected to present the matter to Mr. Ford who in due course of time wrote out his check for $3,000,000 . However , this was but a small part of the " Greater . Plan . " Millions had to be invested in docks , cranes , smelters and equipment at Detroit . Changes had to he made in the location of the tractor plant . Docks , lumber mills , new towns had to be created on the land in the North . Ships must be built ; bridges made new , over which Ford locomotives and Ford railway cars could pass without danger . ELIMINATING THE MIDDLEMA N It is conservatively estimated that Mr. Ford may , have $200.000,000 invested in equipment in order to eliminate the " middle mall " , which is perhaps the most effective argument to reach Mr. Ford 's pocketbook just now. ! His salesmen have been very successful and loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's greatest genius . Many have advanced the idea that this great venture of the " boss " : was the one thing to meet the days of price cutting . Within the last very few weeks Mr. Ford sent out an order abolishing territorial limits . Men who had dill. ; gently worked up trade in certain territory , putting up the necessary capital to finance a contract with Mr. Ford , find that under the new order there are no districts " owned " by any agent . The Ford people say this will put everyone on his merit and the best man will win . SELLING CARS TO SALESMEN It should not be forgotten that the Parts Department of the Ford buSiness is enormous . One curious thing in ' the way of sales induction was an advertisement in the - Want Columns " that the ** .. igeliss wanted is salosman and when the applicant put in appearance only those ; who could afford to purchase " demonstrators " were taken and on an exclusively commission basis .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
