The money , he testified , was turned over in three payments of $20 , - 000 each and one of $10,000 . He admitted that he had deposited $253,659.12 in the bank , but said the $70,000 was part of a " separate fund . " Mr. Folwell testified that " a group of Pennsylvania citizens " whom he could not identify was expected to make up part of the money which Joseph R. Grundy and himself advanced toward the Pepper-Fisher campaign fund in Eastern Pennsylvania . All efforts to draw from him any names failed , as he positively said he did not know who they were .

Mr. Grundy personally advanced $300,000 in addition . Most of today 's hearing was devoted to an attempt to ascertain whether the SLIM was in fact a " loan " or whether it was a contribution . Mr. Folwell and one of his assistants , Frank J. Gorman , who kept the accounts , were examined in detail concerning apparent changes of entry in the account book showing that the respective sums advanced by Mr. Grundy were marked in each instance as a " loan , " the change being made 1 after , the entry .

Fails-to Name Other Officers . Although Mr. Folwell was Vice President of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers ' Association he could give no names of the other officers except Mr. Grundy , being unable to say who was the Treasurer or the Secretary of the association . He could not tell the kinds of manufacturers who were members . He thought the steel companies might be , but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His answers were cautious at every point , and it was with the greatest difficulty that his questioners broke through his " guard . " At the outset he was asked this question about the manufacturers ' organization : " Has that association ever taken any part in politics ? " " As such ? " he parried . " Well , has it ever sent out letters or done other things in the way of ptdit cal activity ? " " I do n't know very much about it , " Mr. Folwell said . Mr. Folwell said he could not tell of any plans to raise money , at least before he went to Europe . Senator Reed asked him if it was his signature signed as Treasurer to a receipt which the Senator held in his hand . " That is my rubber stamp , " Mr. Folwell said . It took some questioning to ascertain who had authority to use this stamp , which had been used on a receipt to Sir . Grundy for $8,160 .

Mr. Folwell said a few checks had been turned over to him also , but he could not recall whom they were from or what were the amounts . The aggregate , he estimated , would be no more than $1,000 or $1,200 . He authorized Hill to endorse checks also . Hill , it was explained , was connected with his insurance company ? the Manufacturers ' Casualty Insurance Company  --  which was described as a mutual concern on the stock plan . " What is your capital stock , " asked Senator Reed , after Mr. Folwell had said that he himself Was the concern 's President . " I ca n't say , " he replied . " You do n't know the capital stock of your own company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the witness admitted . " Are you in the habit , " Senator Reed asked . " of allowing $300,000 to be bandied in your name like this ? " " No . " " Did you ever do it before . " " I may have done so in the Harding campaign . " Roped " Citizens " Would Pay .  - -  Questions followed about the $90,000 note signed by Folwell and Grundy as a joint note : Senator Reed sought without success to get a clear statement from the witness as to where he hoped to get the money , but it was sifted down to the point where Mr. f ; rundy appeared to be the responsible party , although Mr. Folwell said it was hoped to get the money " from citizens of Pennsylvania . " He was asked why the two signed the note when all the rest of the money had been advanced by Mr. Grundy . " We could get it at the bank , " was the response . " Mr. Grundy was the ' angel ' while you were away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the bank ? " " I do n't know , " said Mr. Folwell . It developed a little later that the money was for paying ' watchers , ' but no details could be obtained . " You ' know . " said Senator Reed , " you did n't sign a note for $90,000 without knowing what it was for . " " It was for campaign expenditures , " the witness said . " Where were you going to get the money to pay the bank ? " his questioner continued . " Were you going to contribute it ? " " Part of it , " said Mr. Folwell . " There was no arrangement as to what part I was to pay . It was understood between Mr. Grundy and myself that it would be eventually collected . We were to get it in the future , from people interested in the election . " " Who were they ? " he was asked . " I/ do n't know , " was his reply . " Do you mean to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $90,000 note and not know what crowd or group it was coming from ? " " I.Vell , no definite group or organization , " said Mr. Folwell . " Tell us all about it , Mr. Falwell , " Senator Reed said , impatiently . Planned to Canvass State . The witness declared that " we had to go about the State and we felt the Republicans would come to our aid . " He admitted that he was not wealthy enough to be able to lose $90,000 . He mid he believed he would get the money from " different citizens of Pennsylvania . " but could not name a single one . He declared however , " I thought if we could not collect it . Mr. Grundy would make good the money . " " You expected to get some from the Manufacturers ' Association , " Senator Bing suggested . " Not as manufacturers , " quickly replied Mr. Folwell . The witness declared that neither Secretary Mellon nor any members of his family were to be among the contributors to the fund . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed any of the $300,000 he advanced , or whether Charles M. Schwab was a member of the Manufacturers ' Association . its membership , he thought , was 1,200 and the dues ranged from $10 to $250 or $300 a year and the association existed for the interests of the members . Mr. Folwell was cautious when he was asked if the meeting of the Republicans on Saturday in Philadelphia ould facilitate the collection of his share of the $90,000 . " I am not a prophet ; 1 can not tell that . " he replied . " Will it facilitate matters ? " " I do n't know . " he replied . " I hope so . I have n't thought about it . " It was brought out from Mr. Folwell that the Manufacturers Association and the Republican Citizens Finance Committee occupied the same building in Philadelphia , five floors apart . Much of Mr. Gorman 's time before the committee was occupied by an examination of his books to get at the facts about the Grundy advances . As the various items were read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money was advanced . Once Mr. Grundy produced $18,240 in cash . " Did he tell you where he got it ? " Senator Reed asked Mr. Gorman . " No " was the reply . arator Reed took the account book traced , each Grundy , advance , pointing out that there appeared the word " loan " in separate writing after the entry . Mr. Gorman could not agree always that the entry seemed to differ . Watson Tells of Vare Funds . At the night session , Thomas F. Watson Sr. confirmed the testimony of Edward M. Kenna , Treasurer of Vare 's Pittsburgh committee , that Mr. Watson and his son , Thomas G. Watson Jr. , gave Kenna a total of $70,000 for the campaign . The money was turned over in three payments of $20,000 each and one of $10,000 . " Who elected you Chairman " Senator Reed asked . " Nobody , " replied Mr. Watson . " Vare just asked me to serve . " Ha had deposited in all $253,659.12 in the bank , but he said the $70,000 was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . " How much more was not in the bank , " - Senator Reed asked the witness . Mr. Watson said the $161,095 , besides the $70,000 , was not put on deposit . " Figure , then . that $484,754.72 was the natal contribution through you , " Senator Goff suggested . " How much money did you contribute . " Senator Reed inquired . " Twenty-five thousand dollars , and I told ' Bill ' Vare if he was a candidate I would give him that much , " was the reply . Contributions to the Vare campaign included $50,000 front Thomas W. Cunningham , Treasurer of the Republican State Committee , of Philadelphia ; Gladys K. Calket , $10,000 , and Jules Mastbaum , the moving picture magnate , $10,000 , Mr. Watson told the committee . " When you sent the money to Mr. Kenna why did n't you put the money in the bank and send a draft ? " Senator Reed queried . " I do n't know , " the witness replied ' . " I just gave it to the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was taking , " he added . " He knew it was money , did n't he ? " " Yes . " " Why did n't you put all the money in the bank ? " asked Senator Reed . " You did not want people to know how much money you paid out did you ? Why did n't you pay out by check ? " " Well , without beating around the bush we did n't know we were coming before a committee like this . That 's the cleanest answer I can make . " Senator Reed laughed and said he saw the Vare people had not wanted everybody to know what they were doing in the campaign . Tells of $1,000 Shortage . Any shortage in the Vare campaign was small , about $1,000 , and a $900 balance in the bank would cover it , Mr. Watson said . " Where did you keep the cash that was not in the bank ? " Senator Reed asked . " In a little iron box . " Thomas F. Watson Jr. , who carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pittsburgh , followed the senior Watson on the stand . He said his father merely handed him an envelope and he did not know how muen money the envelope contained , on any of three occasions . " Do you know anything about the activities of any temporary organizations in the campaign ? " Senator Reed asked . " No sir . " When the witness said some church organizations participated , Senator Reed asked : " Ministers ? " " Yes . " " For your campaign ? " " No . " To Senator Reed he said he knew nothing about anti-prohibition associations aiding the Vare campaign . Senator Reed said Wayne B. Wheeler had said , wet organizations had participated in the campaign . " Surely , " said the Senator , " you do n't think Mr. Wheeler could ever be wrong ? " " I do , " answered young Mr. Watson . The witness said he knew of no contribution from the brewers to the Vare campaign . Senator Goff asked if the recent primary was really a wet and dry issue . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " They were divided , " the witness replied , but he added that not many drys supported Vare . Mr. Watson Jr . said wets and drys voted for Pepper and Pinchot as well as for Vara according to their preferences . He took the ground that the primary was a matter of how the candidates appealed to the voters irrespective of the prohibition issue . Vare lost in Mr. Watson 's ward , the fsiielkd. stocking ward , the witness testi " How much did the silk stockings beat the common people ? " " About 20,000 votes . " Vare Takes Stand Himself . At 10 o'clock Representative Vare took the stand . He described himself as a partner in the Vare Construction Company and a Member ofsCongress for fourteen years . Thinking in February of becoming a candidate for the Senate " my highest ambition , " he sounded out Harry A. Mackey on managing his campaign and then proceeded to make further arrangements , Mr. Vare said . After consultation with various friends he announced his candidacy and " within twenty-four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The support he received from the Republican organization outside of Philadelphia was " nominal , " Mr. Vare declared . " I carried only one county outside of Philadelphia , " he added . Alluding to the coalition between the Vare and Mellon forces in Philadelphia last Saturday , Senator King said the " lion laid down with the lamb , " but Mr. Vare said , " No , there - were more votes for the coalition than there I I were not . " He would not agree that he had been " outwitted by the Mellon forces , " as Senator King put it , " Was Mr. Fisher the representative of the New York railroads ? " Senator King asked . " I did not know it . " Letters Cost Him 6 Cents Each . Representative Vare estimated the cost of the letters at 6 cents each . In no case did he use his Congressional frank , he said . " Know of any money contributed by the wet organizations ? " Senator Reed asked . " Absolutely not ; I am sure there was none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conributed to my campaign he is mistaken . " Asked by Senator Reed if any men ' running in Philadelphia spent money for his campaign , Mr. Vare said he doubted it . " Did n't you . always pay when you were running for Congress ? " Senator King inquired . " Yes , but I paid as an individual . " Senator Reed remarked that Pennsylvania must be a " cheap " State for a Congressman to run in if he did not have to contribute , and Representative Vare replied : " I think it is remarkably cheap . " " If you are backed in Philadelphia by the organization you do n't have to spend much money , but if you are not with the organization you do have to spend money , " Senator Reed suggested . " In unity there is strength , " was Representative Vare 's reply . " About a 6 to 1 proposition , " he put it ? " 6 for Pinchot to 1 for Pepper . " Finding the opposition of the press , his most important step was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on to describe how he tried to reach the farmers . He advised the farmers , he said , of the fact that he originally was a farm boy and of the farm legislation he had sponsored in Congress . " I made an intensive personal campaign , and in it I spent $71,000 , all for letters , stamps , ac. , " he explained . When he reached Philadelphia he found that the majority of the Republican State Committee had " got the jump on us , " and favored the election of W. L. Mellon as Chairman , he said . But that , he said , was before the election of Harry Baker as Secretary . When Representative Vare told of the work of the Republican organization in Philadelphia for schools and public playgrounds , Senator Reed put in : " And occasionally trying to get somebody out of jail . " " I have never called on a prohibition agent or a District Attorney since prohibition went into effect , " Mr. Vare answered . " That is n't what I asked you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice with mercy . " Harry A Mackey , the Vare manager , . who was seated behind Mr. Vare , was sharply called to order by Senator King for putting in side remarks , " You will have a chance to testify , Mr. Mackey , " the Senator said abruptly , and Mr. Mackey subsided . Representative Vare was put through an intensive cross-examination by Senator King , but he denied that anything in the way of corruption had entered into his campaign . The Pittsburgh end of the campaign was taken up by Senator Reed , who made Mr. Vare admit he realized money must be spent there , but Mr. Vare insisted he did not know how much would be required . Senator Reed was boring hard into Mr. Vare endeavoring to make the ! Senatorial nominee admit that he knew , all the details of the money spent in Pittsburgh and implying that he would not reveal them when the hearing ended ' shortly after 11 o'clock tonight .                  @ @ @
