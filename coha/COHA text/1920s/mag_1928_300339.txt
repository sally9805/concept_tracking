MEET GENERAL GRANT-W . E. Woodward-Liveright ( $5.00 ) . <P> The Man . Gruff soldier with heart of gold and will of iron , brilliant in strategy , steadfast in courage-nothing dandified in his uniform , nothing lily-livered in his perpetual cigar , nothing watered about his liquor-such is , and will be , the popular impression of victorious U. S. Grant , modern biographers to the contrary . <P> To begin with , his name was not even the U. S. Grant of fame and fancy , but Hiram Ulysses Grant-the initials proudly etched in brass tacks on the trunk he was to take on his unwilling way to West Point . Suspecting that fellow cadets would guy him for initials H. U. G. , he plucked out the tacks , signed himself reversely Ulysses Hiram . But the registrar had him down as Ulysses Simpson Grant ( an absent-minded senator had assumed the mother 's maiden name ) and refused him admittance without authorization from Washington . Ulysses , characteristically impatient of government red tape , made short shrift by changing his signature to U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at West Point by slovenliness of person , mediocrity of scholarship , hatred of firearms , and a certain girlish squeamishness of profanity and rough jokes . His femininity was emphasized by a callow appearance-indeed , during leisure hours of the Mexican War , Grant took the part , in amateur theatricals , of Desdemona , no less . <P> It was in these same leisure hours that Grant took to " solitary drinking " because ( his present biographer is a disciple of passe Freud ) he had no Mexican mistress , shrank from raucous army companions , refused to attend a second bullfight . Considerable drunkenness was overlooked in those days , but Grant 's must have been more than considerable , for he drank himself out of the army , thereby blundering upon the road to fame . If he had stayed in the army , which he detested and disapproved but had n't the initiative to quit , he would have had a conventional small command in the Civil War . As it happened , he was drifting from farmer pillar to salesclerk post , miserably deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ townsfolk , when the war started . Grant decided he must repay the government for his free , if meager , education at West Point . For months his desultory applications for a command were ignored , but when the need for better generalship grew desperate , a trick of chance politics brought him to the crucial command in Tennessee . <P> His first conspicuous victory was greeted with Union-wide exultation , and curiosity as to this unknown U. S. ( " Unconditional Surrender " ) Grant . Journalists glossed their ignorance with fantastic tales of Grant riding casually to battle , coat un buttoned , cigar in mouth . Immediately the hero was deluged with boxes of cigars - 10,000 in quick order - and though he gave hundreds away , " having such a quantity on hand I naturally smoked more than I would have done under ordinary circumstances , and I have continued the habit ever since . "
