THE steamer Paris arrived with Gloria Swanson and Paderewski , two very famous people , one a musician and the other a moving picture actress . The moving picture actress brings proof that her husband 's people have been in the Marquis class since 1707 . The musician makes no statement concerning his social standing . The inference is that playing the piano better than anybody else and being called the first statesman in Europe by Colonel House has more or less resigned Paderewski to seeing Miss Swanson get ahead of him socially  --  in Hollywood . EVERY once in a while it sweeps i over us what a blot upon our otherwise fair and spotless city is the Sixth Avenue Elevated . Any move to get rid of the thing has the approval of this uncompromising writer . It has no merit , as it stands , in our eyes . On the economic side  --  the property owners of Sixth Avenue could guarantee to furnish free transportation in busses in perpetuity and make money by it . No doubt , the elevated carries people about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seldom are we sorry that New York , unlike Chicago , St. Louis , and the rest of them , has no civic pride . SPEAKING of the Prince of Wales , we desire to say that falling off a horse when he shies and falling with a horse are two very different things . By saying so , we become the only writer in the public prints who knows that much . We know that any THE TOWN man who says he has never had a fall advertises himself as an inexperienced horseman . Therefore , in our wisdom , we do not berate the Prince as a bad rider for his latest somersault . We are convinced , however , that he is a bad horseman ; for the art of horsemanship includes the knack of keeping your horse on his feet .

" Sixty-Six THEpremonitory rumblings con- cerning a repertory theatre at Number 66 Fifth Avenue , once noted in this department , have gained such volume that one hears the opening pro duction is set for the end of this month . The play chosen for the premiere is , of course , by a CzechoSlovakian , whose name in this case is Francis Langer , and the translated tide , which was once " Periphery " is now " Ragged Edge " . There are to be as many as six plays , under the artistic guidance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first offering . The institution itself , we learn , will be known as the " 66 Theatre " . THE unknown patron of the new 66 , whose name TrsE NEW YORKER was constrained not to reveal earlier , has consented , reluctantly , to unmask . He is Mr. A. I. Kaplan , whose power to aid art came through his efficient conduct in the molasses business , about which mellifluous substance he knows more than anyone else in the world . A dark , curly-headed Russian whose small body seems even smaller under a massive head , he is invariably hatless as he walks abroad from his office at 28 Fifth Avenue . He has been considered one of Wall Street 's quiet eccentrics , but he is better known in Cuba where he learned of molasses first hand , and where he was so well observed that a Cuban novelist wrote a book about him . Mr. Kaplan is of molasses affiliations no longer . Since he left the industr ? , his chief interests have been theatrical . He was one of the first backers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent for making money will persist in being effective in Number 66 . There , we have said , will be Mr. Albert Boni 's publishing offices and an unrelated opera school under the tutelage of an Italian impressario , Mr. George De Feo . But Mr. Kaplan , who owns Number 66 , contents himself with his interests in the repertory theatre . In that and in the evasion of publicity and formal evening wear . Warrior IF Mr. Albert Payson Terhune I- should be in need of the nucleus of a plot for a short story with a dog as central character , what follows might serve very well . It has the disadvantage , however , of being true , and whosoever challenges its veracity will be overwhelmed by a series of affidavits assembled by our own Mr. Rea Irvin , one of which is sworn to by his own artistic self . A neighbor of Mr. Irvin 's in the Spuyten Duyvil district owned an Irish terrior , which was named , not unnaturally , Brian Boru . In the course of normal events , the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent . Brian Boru 's owner thereupon bundled his pet into the family car and drove to a veterinary in Yonkers , several miles away , where the dog 's hurts were bound up . Several weeks later the Irish terrier again engaged in conflict , and once again was sorely wounded . Without returning to his home , he set out for Yonkers and arrived at the veterinary 's office , where he scratched at the door until he was admitted . Treatment was administered and the owner advised by telephone to come and get his dog . Twice more exactly the same procedure was followed by Brian Boru . He fought , was hurt , and trotted off to Yonkers to have his wounds bound up . Then , after a fifth battle , he set off for Yonkers once more . Fortuna was against the Irish terrier this time , however . The veterinary was out of town . The dog was found on the doorsteps of his office , having died from loss of blood . Race Problem NE New York club has just be-1.  - -  1 gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has enlivened its halls in many a year . The excitement was produced by the circumstance that one of its members , a physician , quietly but firmly brought a negro to break bread with him in the " Let 's sit down now ! " club dining room . On the arrival of the two at their table , the surrounding membership suddenly took on the outward aspect recently portrayed in these pages in Mr. Irvin 's Tomato Surprise drawing . Sundry of the more outraged stole out in quest of the superintendent , and a few moments later , the doctor was notified that he was wanted at the telephone . Once out in the hall , he found a raging superintendent who assured him that the club would not and could not serve the dusky guest . The doctor replied glacially that the club not only could but would serve his guest . The upshot of the whispered but furious debate was that the negro was served  --  and served handsomely . Since then , the complaints have showered on the house committee , the house committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is barely possible that he will not try it again ? out of consideration , however , for his negro friends whom he is , presumably , loath to subject to embarrassment . IT was , the doctor narrates , one of the most distinguished lawyers in this country who explained to him that he might have known better . " When I ask my negro friends to dine with me , " the old lawyer said , " I am always careful to avoid those clubs made up of men nervous about their social position . I take them instead to such indisputable organizations as the University Club , or the Down Town Club , or St. Botolph 's in Boston . It is quite possible that some of the members there are equally disturbed , but their manners are so good that the negro never finds it out . " Entente VER .

" Might have him over ; looks as though he needs bucking up , " murmured Mr. Coward . He walked over and spoke to Mr. Griffith . " I am Noel Coward , " he began modestly . Mr. Griffith munched on , unimpressed . " Wrote ' The Vortex ' and ' Hay Fever ' and those silly things , " added Mr. Coward hurriedly . Mr. Griffith dipped into the finger bowl . " Surely you know my leading lady , Miss Crews ? " " No , " said Mr. Griffith , examining a crumb minutely . " I was an extra in your ' Hearts of the World ' , Mr. Griffith , I pushed a wheelbarrow . " " There was an army of extras in my ' Hearts of the World ' . Many of them pushed wheelbarrows , " Mr. Griffith observed . " Well , wo n't you come to my opening to-night ?

Bellows could not paint the aesthetic . He would do nothing pretty , neither sentimental . He was antagonized by the smart , the modish , or the rich , in persons or in things . Thus , when a fasionable lady approached him on the matter of a portrait  --  flattering , of course  --  he responded that he would do it , " If it 's definitely understood that I can paint two noses on your face . " He was not , obviously , in demand as a portrait painter . This remunerative field was closed to him by virtue of his sturdy independence and , although he was an artistic success from the conclusion of his student days under Robert Henri , lie earned only twenty thousand dollars in ten years . Recognition of his genius brought him everything except money . In contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fate by which Sir Joseph Duveen missed something good in connection with Bellows . The story has it that Sir Joseph contemplated purchasing , for six thousand dollars , " Emma and Her Children " , but changed his mind . Six months later , after Bellows 's death , the Boston Museum paid twenty-two thousand dollars for the canvas , the record figure , thus far , for the artist 's work . ? THOSE gay dogs of the older generation ! . . . The sexagenarian treasurer of one of the best known Eastern universities was travelling in England this Summer with his wife and another elderly couple , and one day in London passed by a window display of Canadian Club Whiskey . The temptation was too great ; he entered the store and purchased a bottle . Followed the orgy to which the university treasurer , lost to all sense of shame or repentance , has just confessed to one of his younger colleagues .

He has also completed the brief suite called " Circus Days " written for Paul Whiteman  --  a composition with some jazz in it , but not much . The completion of these two pieces clears the deck for the opera which the Metropolitan has commanded , and of which the librettist is supposed to be none other than Edna St. Vincent Millay . The shadow of doubt cast by the word " supposed " has its origins in the fact that Miss Millay is now on the sick list with no likelihood of being able to complete her part of the work by the time Mr. Taylor will presumably be panting to begin . Miss Millay , whu has been dwelling at Austerlitz , New York , on a remote and peculiarly inaccessible farm , has returned to town in the throes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 41 Fifth Avenue are guarding her closely against the ructions and intrusions of New York . IF her convalescence should be protracted , there is , of course , one other person who could write a libretto for a Deems Taylor score and that is Deems Taylor , for that superb musician , composer , critic , cook , typographer , and cabinet-maker is also no mean master of verse . Mr. Taylor has been living at Wynnewood , a suburb of Philadelphia , and the statement made here recently to the effect that he was functioning there as the head of the Curtis Institute of Music ( a statement into which THE NEW YORKER was led in one of its rare spasms of credulity ) caused considerable hilarity in the bosom of Edward W. Bok , whose wife is actually the head of the school .

While the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limousine draw up to the curb and debauch a magnificent lady . His heart leaped to see her THE NEW YORKER most graciously examine the window display , and most graciously enter . After looking about a few minutes , she turned to a shield-back chair of Sheraton design and inquired the price . Forty-five dollars ; it was nut too much , yet she hesitated . The one in the window was the same , was it not ? It was indeed the same , and so she preferred it ; and it was carried to her motor . It was the clerk 's first sale . When the proprietor returned he was given a gushing account of the whole romantic transaction . Glancing at the shield-back chair that remained , he turned ashen . Then he rushed to the show window and looked around the partition . " You idiot ! " he screamed , " the one in the window was the real Sheraton ! " Belles Letters INCE Mr. Frank Munsey ; after I- , a lifetime 's labor , placed both the morning and evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound economic basis , the favorite back parlor sport of journalism has been trying to guess who would start the next newspaper . Among those most frequently mentioned as possible beneficiaries of Mr. Munsey 's amalgamating benevolences have been the Messrs . Patterson and McCormick , publishers of the Chicago Tribune , the Daily News , and Liberty , this last being the weekly which paid twenty thousand dollars for its name . And , of course , the present visit of Mr. Patterson to town has given Life again to the old , old rumors . An evening newspaper this time , they say . Colonel McCormick will have the Chicago field under his control and Mr. Patterson will preside over enlarged activities about New York . This is as it may be . Certainly , Mr. Patterson has had sufficient cares to occupy any man 's time , of late , attending to the affairs of Liberty . For one thing , its editor , Mr. John A. Wheeler , has resigned , deeming the newspaper syndicate he owns more important than any weekly . Mr. ' Wheeler is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has been managing editor of Liberty and who , it is said , has been in the main responsible for that publication 's engaging and lucrative prize contests , in one of which , it will be recalled , Miss Fannie Hurst was a successful competitor . Mr. Duel goes into office backed by a sweeping series of manifestos issued lately to Liberty 's editorial staff by Mr. Patterson . To Mr. Rex Lardner , brother of the genial Ring , it was said : " Get the best fiction written in the English language . Spare no expense , no time , no effort . Have men combing the cities of the United States and Europe . But get the best fiction . " To Mr. Walter Davenport , this edict went forth : " We want the two most sensational articles in the world each week . Finance is unlimited . Get ' em . " And to Mr. Hugh Fullerton instructions were no less explicit : " The greatest weekly sport page in the world . That 's what you 're to deliver . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hop to it .

Not only do all my hostesses have them  --  the tables , I mean  --  but even in my own costly demesne does the gate-leg kick me in the shins . But the antique manufacturers , it seemed to the Honest Man  --  who is exclusively on the payroll of THE NEW YORKER  --  have already made enough gate-leg tables to supply the quaint-at-any-price trade . Now they are going in for quantity production of full-rigged ships and - old maps , framed . Maps of what ? Of the Bronx River Parkway ? Of the Mohawk Trail ? Of Ideal Tour No , 3 ? But not !

And does she know whether Long Island is in New York State ? Not Miss Legion , whose quaint living room contains three full-rigged ships , one ship 's clock that stopped in 1882 at 4:25 a. m. , and three maps of some place or other , beautifully framed .

He has disowned the wanderlust , the vagrant meal , the glowing fire of the hobo 's jungle . Orthodoxy has claimed the rebel . Among other things , he preaches and sedulously practices abstinence from liquor . Thus does our national prosperity envelope our former prophets of the free life . Mr. Harry Kemp grown well-to-do out of his royalties . Mr. Jim Tully reclaimed from the road to hobnob with our princes of the commercial theatre .
