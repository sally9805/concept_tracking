Herr Fritz von Opel , inventor of the famed rocket auto , has been dogged by bad luck . <P> Last week , he was catted by the Association of German Friends of Cats , and by Herr Victor Fraenkl , chairman of the German League for Animal Rights , one of the Association 's principal spokesmen . <P> Inventor von Opel had placed a cat in his rocket car ( TIME , June 4 ) . He wished to test the resistance of a living organism to high speed . But the car never attained high speed . Instead it exploded . The cat was never found . <P> Hence the cat lovers ' ire , the catting of Inventor von Opel , at a mass indignation meeting in Berlin of German Friends of Cats .
