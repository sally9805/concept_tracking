The striking thesis was weightily advanced in Paris , last week , that France has doubled or tripled in economic strength , directly as a result of the War . <P> In a massive 343-page report this conclusion is drawn from a multitude of sources by Commercial Counselor Joseph R. Cahill of the British Embassy at Paris . The report was issued in book form , last week , by the British Department of Overseas Trade and produced an international sensation . One of its major conclusions , that French prosperity is due in large part to the French protective tariff , was promptly taken up in London by the many onetime English free traders who have now turned protectionist . The most potent of these is Baron Melchett , foremost British Chemical and Industrial Tycoon ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) . Speaking in London last week Lord Melchett alluded to the Cahill Report and belligerently said : <P> " The people of other states are not hesitating to defend their position by means of high tariffs . It is time for the Empire to assert itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like myself . But conditions have changed and the traditional free trade sentiment of the British public has changed with them . More iron is wanted in the soul of this country ! We must have the courage to put a high tariff wall around the Empire ! " <P> Returning to the Cahill Report on French Prosperity , observers noted first its unequivocally optimistic tone : " France is at present incalculably stronger industrially than in 1913 . . . . Hers is an enhanced , all-pervading and solidly based economic advance . . . signal prosperity ... an age of industrial expansion unprecedented in French history and of a magnitude unsurpassed by any other European country . " <P> Counselor Joseph Cahill , exhaustively analyzing whole mountains of sources , concludes that present French prosperity rests on four primary bases : 1 ) Stabilization of the franc by Prime Minister Raymond Poincare , an achievement now nearly two years old ( TIME , Feb. 7 , 1927 ) ; 2 ) Protection of French industries by the present tariff ; 3 ) Enlargement of French factories and productive equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical efficiency . <P> In developing the last two and major points of his thesis Counselor Cahill is factually illuminating where most analysts would prove vague . He observes that the capture by Imperial Germany of so many industrial towns in Northern France forced the development of an entire new industrial area around such southern , central and western cities as Marseilles , Bordeaux , Toulouse , Grenoble , Limoges , Tours , Caen , Rouen and even Paris . It is these new and War-born producer areas which Mr. Cahill hails as of paramount significance in the French industrial boom of today . <P> With authentic enthusiasm Counselor Cahill writes : " France has become the greatest iron ore country in Europe ; she has acquired potash concessions far in excess of her consumption ; compared with 1923 , she has increased her coal output by one-sixth , doubled her coke output and more than trebled her electrical capacity .
