COPPER STREAK TRAIL by EUGENE MANLOVE RHODES Author of Stepsons Of Light , Good Men And True , West Is West , etc. 1917 TO THE READER OF THIS BOOK FROM ONE WHO SAW LIFE UNSTEADILY AND IN PART CHAPTER I The stage line swung aside in a huge half-circle , rounding the northern end of the Comobabi Range and swinging far out to skirt the foothills . Mr. Peter Johnson had never been to Silverbell : his own country lay far to the north , beyond the Gila . But he knew that Silverbell was somewhere east of the Comobabi , not north ; and confidently struck out to find a short cut through the hills . From Silverbell a spur of railroad ran down to Redrock . Mr. Johnson 's thought was to entrain himself for Tucson . The Midnight horse reached along in a brisk , swinging walk , an optimistic walk , good for four miles an hour . He had held that gait since three o'clock in the morning , with an hour off for water and breakfast at Smith 's Wells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now hot noon by a conscientious sun -- thirty-six miles . But Midnight did not care . For hours their way had been through a trackless plain of uncropped salt grass , or grama , on the rising slopes : now they were in a country of worn and freshly traveled trails : wise Midnight knew there would be water and nooning soon . Already they had seen little bands of horses peering down at them from the high knolls on their right . Midnight wondered if they were to find sweet water or alkali . Sweet , likely , since it was in the hills ; Midnight was sure he hoped so . The best of these wells in the plains were salt and brackish . Privately , Midnight preferred the Forest Reserve . It was a pleasant , soft life in these pinewood pastures . Even if it was pretty dull for a good cow-horse after the Free Range , it was easier on old bones . And though Midnight was not insensible to the compliment Pete had paid him by picking him from the bunch for these long excursions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been together a long time , the bunch ; Pete had brought them from the Block Ranch , over in New Mexico . They were getting on in years , and so was Pete . Midnight mused over his youthful days -- the dust , the flashing horns , the shouting and the excitement of old round-ups . It is a true telling that thoughts in no way unlike these buzzed in the rider 's head as a usual thing . But to-day he had other things to think of . With Kid Mitchell , his partner , Pete had lately stumbled upon a secret of fortune -- a copper hill ; a warty , snubby little gray hill in an insignificant cluster of little gray hills . But this one , and this one only , precariously crusted over with a thin layer of earth and windblown sand , was copper , upthrust by central fires ; rich ore , crumbling , soft ; a hill to be loaded , every yard of it , into cars yet unbuilt , on a railroad yet undreamed-of , save by these two lucky adventurers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For in the southwest , close upon the Mexican border , in the most lonesome corner of the most lonesome county of thinly settled Arizona , turning back from a long and fruitless prospecting trip , they had paused for one last , half-hearted venture . One idle stroke of the pick in a windworn bare patch had turned up -- this ! So Pete Johnson 's thoughts were of millions ; not without a queer feeling that he would n't have the least idea what to do with them , and that he was parting with something in his past , priceless , vaguely indefinable : a sharing and acceptance of the common lot , a brotherhood with the not fortunate . Riding to the northwest , Pete 's broad gray sombrero was tilted aside to shelter from the noonday sun a russet face , crinkled rather than wrinkled , and dusty . His hair , thinning at the temples , vigorous at the ears , was crisply white . A short and lately trimmed mustache held a smile in ambush ; above it towered such a nose as Wellington loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran from the corners of it , flanking the white mustache , to a mouth strong , full-lipped and undeniably large , ready alike for laughter or for sternness . The nose -- to follow the creases back again -- was fleshy and beaked at the tip ; it narrowed at the level bridge and broadened again where it joined the forehead , setting the eyes well apart . The eyes themselves were blue , just a little faded -- for the man was sixty-two -- and there were wind-puckers at the corners of them . But they were keen eyes , steady , sparkling and merry eyes , for all that ; they were deep-set and long , and they sloped a trifle , high on the inside corners ; pent in by pepper-and-salt brows , bushy , tufted and thick , roguishly aslant from the outer corners up to where they all but met above the Wellingtonian nose . A merry face , a forceful face : Pete was a little man , five feet seven , and rather slender than otherwise ; but no one , in view of that face , ever thought of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint path merged with another and another , the angles of convergence giving the direction of the unknown water hole ; they came at last to the main trail , a trunk line swollen by feeders from every ridge and arroyo . It bore away to the northeast , swerving , curving to pitch and climb in faultless following of the rule of roads -- the greatest progress with the least exertion . Your cow is your best surveyor . They came on the ranch suddenly , rounding a point into a small natural amphitheater . A flat-roofed dugout , fronted with stone , was built into the base of a boulder-piled hill ; the door was open . Midnight perked his black head jauntily and slanted an ear . High overhead , a thicket of hackberry and arrow-weed overhung the little valley . From this green tangle a pipe line on stilts broke away and straddled down a headlong hill . Frost was unknown ; the pipe was supported by forked posts of height assorted to need , an expedient easier than ditching that iron hillside . The water discharged into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small corral of cedar stakes ; through the open gate , as he rode by , Pete saw a long watering-trough with a float valve . Before the dugout stood a patriarchal juniper , in the shade of which two saddled horses stood droop-hipped , comfortably asleep . Waking , as Pete drew near , they adjusted their disarray in some confusion and eyed the newcomers with bright-eyed inquiry . Midnight , tripping by , hailed them with a civil little whinny . A tall , heavy man upreared himself from the shade . His example was followed by another man , short and heavy . Blankets were spread on a tarpaulin beyond them . " ' Light , stranger , " said the tall man heartily . " Unsaddle and eat a small snack . We was just taking a little noonday nap for ourselves . " " Beans , jerky gravy , and bread , " announced the short man , waiter fashion . " I 'll hot up the coffee . " With the word he fed little sticks and splinters to a tiny fire , now almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , to all that ; thank you , " said Pete , slipping off . He loosened the cinches ; so doing he caught from the corner of his eye telegraphed tidings , as his two hosts rolled to each other a single meaningful glance , swift , furtive , and white-eyed . Observing which , every faculty of Pete Johnson 's mind tensed , fiercely alert , braced to attention . " Now what ? Some more of the same . Lights out ! Protect yourself ! " he thought , taking off the saddle . Aloud he said : " One of Zurich 's ranches , is n't it ? I saw ZK burned on the gateposts . " He passed his hand along Midnight 's sweaty back for possible bruise or scald ; he unfolded the Navajo saddle blanket and spread it over the saddle to dry . He took the sudaderos -- the jute sweatcloths under the Navajo -- and draped them over a huge near-by boulder in the sun , carefully smoothing them out to prevent wrinkles ; to all appearance without any other care on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall man . " Now you water the black horse and I 'll dig up a bait of corn for him . Wash up at the trough . " " Puesto que si ! " said Pete . He slipped the bit out of Midnight 's mouth , pushing the headstall back on the sleek black neck by way of lead rope , and they strode away to the water pen , side by side . When they came back a nose-bag , full of corn , stood ready near the fire . Pete hung this on Midnight 's head . Midnight munched contentedly , with half-closed eyes , and Pete turned to the fire . " Was I kidding myself ? " he inquired . " Or did somebody mention the name of grub ? " " Set up ! " grinned the tall man , kicking a small box up beside a slightly larger one , which served as a table . " Nothing much to eat but food . Canned truck all gone . " The smaller host poured coffee . Pete considered the boxes . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prodding the table with his boot-toe to elucidate his meaning . " And yet I did n't see no wheel marks as I come along . " " Fetch ' em from Silverbell . We got a sort of wagon track through the hills . Closer than Cobre . Some wagon road in the rough places ! Snakes thick on the east side ; but they do n't never get over here . Break their backs comin ' through the gap . Yes , sir ! " " Then I 'll just june along in the cool of the evenin ' , " observed Pete , ladling out a second helping of jerked venison . " I can follow your wagon tracks into town . I ai n't never been to Silverbell . Was afraid I might miss it in the dark . How far is it ? About twenty mile , I reckon ? " " Just about . Shucks ! I was in hopes you 'd stay overnight with us . Bill and me , we ai n't seen no one since Columbus crossed the Delaware in fourteen-ninety-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall man coaxingly . " We 'll pitch horseshoes -- play cards if you want to ; only Bill and me 's pretty well burnt out at cards . Fox and geese too -- ever play fox and geese ? We got a dandy fox-and-goose board -- but Bill , he natcherly ca n't play . He 's from California , Bill is . " " Aw , shut up on that ! " growled Bill . " Sorry , " said Pete , " I 'm pushed . Got to go on to-night . Want to take that train at seven-thirty in the morning , and a small sleep for myself before that . Maybe I 'll stop over as I come back , though . Fine feed you got here . Makes a jim-darter of a horse camp . " " Yes , ' t is . We aim to keep the cattle shoved off so we can save the grass for the saddle ponies . " " Must have quite a bunch ? " " ' Bout two hundred . Well , sorry you ca n't stay with us . We was fixin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em a push back to the main range this afternoon . But they 'll keep . We 'll stick round camp ; and you stay as late as you can , stranger , and we 'll stir up something . I 'll tell you what , Bill -- we 'll pull off that shootin ' match you was blowin ' about . " The tall man favored Johnson with a confidential wink . " Bill , he allows he can shoot right peart . Bill 's from California . " Bill , the short man , produced a gray-and-yellow tobacco sack and extracted a greasy ten-dollar greenback , which he placed on the box table at Johnson 's elbow . " Cover that , durn you ! You hold stakes , stranger . I 'll show him California . Humph ! Dam ' wall-eyed Tejano ! " " I 'm a Texan myself , " twinkled Johnson . " What if you are ? You ai n't wall-eyed , be you ? And you ai n't been makin ' no cracks at California -- not to me . But this here Jim -- look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  Say , are you goin ' to cover that X or are you goin ' to crawfish ? " " Back down ? You peevish little sawed-off runt ! " yelped Jim . " I been lettin ' you shoot off your head so 's you 'll be good and sore afterward . I always wanted a piece of paper money any way -- for a keepsake . You wait ! " He went into the cabin and returned with a tarnished gold piece and a box of forty-five cartridges . " Here , stakeholder ! " he said to Johnson . Then , to Bill : " Now , then , old Californy -- you been all swelled-up and stumping me for quite some time . Show us what you got ! " It was an uncanny exhibition of skill that followed . These men knew how to handle a sixshooter . They began with tin cans at ten yards , thirty , fifty -- and hit them . They shot at rolling cans , and hit them ; at high-thrown cans , and hit them ; at cards nailed to hitching-posts ; then at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . The few and hairbreadth misses of the card pips , the few blanks at the longer ranges , fairly offset each other . The California man took a slightly crouching attitude , his knees a little bent ; held his gun at his knee ; raising an extended and rigid arm to fire . The Texan stood erect , almost on tiptoe , bareheaded ; he swung his gun ear-high above his shoulder , looking at his mark alone , and fired as the gun flashed down . The little California man made the cleaner score at the very long shots and in clipping the pips of the playing cards ; the Texan had a shade the better at the flying targets , his bullets ranging full-center where the other barely grazed the cans . " I do n't see but what I 'll have to keep this money . You 've shot away all the cartridges in your belts and most of the box , and it has n't got you anywheres , " observed Pete Johnson pensively . " Better let your guns cool off . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right well , too , both of you . If you 'd only started at it when you was young , I reckon you 'd both have been what you might call plumb good shots now . " He shook his head sadly and suppressed a sigh . " Wait ! " advised the Texan , and turned to confront his partner . " You make out quite tol'lable with a gun , Billiam , " he conceded . " I got to hand it to you . I judged you was just runnin ' a windy . But have you now showed all your little box of tricks ? " " Well , I have n't missed anything -- not to speak of -- no more than you did , " evaded Bill , plainly apprehensive . " What more do you want ? " Jim chuckled . " Pausin ' lightly to observe that it ought to be easy enough to best you , if we was on horseback -- just because you peek at your sights when you shoot -- I shall now show you something . " A chuck box was propped against the juniper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lids from two ten-pound lard pails . He strode over to where , ten yards away , two young cedars grew side by side , and nailed a lid to each tree , shoulder-high . " There ! " he challenged his opponent . " We ai n't either of us going to miss such a mark as that -- it 's like putting your finger on it . But suppose the tree was shooting back ? Time is what counts then . Now , how does this strike you ? You take the lid on the left and I 'll take the other . When the umpire says Go ! we 'll begin foggin '  - -  and the man that scores six hits quickest gets the money . That 's fair , is n't it , Johnson ? " This was a slip -- Johnson had not given his name -- a slip unnoticed by either of the ZK men , but not by Johnson . " Fair enough , I should say , " he answered . " Why , Jim , that ai n't practical -- that ai n't ! " protested Bill uneasily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shot will stop most men , let alone six . What 's the good of shootin ' a man all to pieces ? " " Suppose there was six men ? " " Then they get me , anyway . Would n't they , Mr. Umpire ? " he appealed to Peter Johnson , who sat cross-legged and fanned himself with his big sombrero . " That do n't make any difference , " decided the umpire promptly . " To shoot straight and quickest -- that 's bein ' a good shot . Line up ! " Bill lined up , unwillingly enough ; they stuffed their cylinders with cartridges . " Do n't shoot till I say : One , two , three -- go ! " admonished Pete . " All set ? One -- two -- three -- go ! " A blending , crackling roar , streaked red and saffron , through black smoke : the Texan 's gun flashed down and up and back , as a man snaps his fingers against the frost ; he tossed his empty gun through the sunlight to the bed under the juniper tree and spread out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " shouted the Texan and pointed . Six bullet holes were scattered across his target , line shots , one above the other ; and poor Bill , disconcerted , had missed his last shot ! " Jim , I guess the stuff is yours , " said Bill sheepishly . The big Texan retrieved his gun from the bed and Pete gave him the stakes . He folded the bill lovingly and tucked it away ; but he flipped the coin from his thumb , spinning in the sun , caught it as it fell , and glanced askant at old Pete . " How long ago did you say it was when you began shootin ' ? " He voiced the query with exceeding politeness and inclined his head deferentially . " Or did you say ? " Pete pondered , pushing his hand thoughtfully through his white hair . " Oh , I began tryin ' when I was about ten years old , or maybe seven . It 's been so long ago I scarcely remember . But I did n't get to be what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was puttin ' on your first pair of pants , " he said sweetly . " There was a time , though , before that -- when I was about the age you are now -- when I really thought I could shoot . I learned better . " A choking sound came from Bill ; Jim turned his eyes that way . Bill coughed hastily . Jim sent the gold piece spinning again . " I 'm goin ' to keep Bill 's tenspot -- always , " he announced emotionally . " I 'll never , never part with that ! But this piece of money --  " He threw it up again . " Why , stranger , you might just as well have that as not . Bill can be stakeholder and give us the word . There 's just six cartridges left in the box for me . " Peter Johnson smiled brightly , disclosing a row of small , white , perfect teeth . He got to his feet stiffly and shook his aged legs ; he took out his gun , twirled the cylinder , and slipped in an extra cartridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber -- safer that way , " he explained . He put the gun back in the holster , dug up a wallet , and produced a gold piece for the stakeholder . " You 'd better clean your gun , young man , " he said . " It must be pretty foul by now . " Jim followed this advice , taking ten minutes for the operation . Meantime the Californian replaced the targets with new ones -- old tin dinner plates this time -- and voiced a philosophical regret over his recent defeat . The Texas man , ready at last , took his place beside Pete and raised his gun till the butt of it was level with his ear , the barrel pointing up and back . Johnson swung up his heavy gun in the same fashion . " Ready ? " bawled Bill . " All right ! One -- two -- three -- go ! " Johnson 's gun leaped forward , blazing ; his left hand slapped back along the barrel , once , twice ; pivoting , his gun turned to meet Bill , almost upon him , hands outstretched . Bill recoiled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texan dropped his empty gun and turned . " You win , " said Pete gently . Not understanding yet , triumph faded from the Texan 's eyes at that gentle tone . He looked at the target ; he looked at Bill , who stood open-mouthed and gasping ; then he looked at the muzzle of Mr. Johnson 's gun . His face flushed red , and then became almost black . Mr. Johnson held the gun easily at his hip , covering both his disarmed companions : Mr. Johnson 's eyebrows were flattened and his mouth was twisted . " It 's loaded ! " croaked Bill in a horrified voice . " The skunk only shot once ! " Peter corrected him : " Three times . I fanned the hammer . Look at the target ! " Bill looked at the target ; his jaw dropped again ; his eyes protruded . There were three bullet holes , almost touching each other , grouped round the nail in the center of Pete 's tin plate . " Well , I 'm just damned ! " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " " That 's fannin ' the hammer , Shorty , " drawled Pete . " Ever hear of that ? Well , now you 've seen it . When you practice it , hold your elbow tight against your ribs to steady your gun while you slap the hammer back . For you , Mr. Jim -- I see you 've landed your six shots ; but some of ' em are mighty close to the edge of your little old plate . Poor shootin ' ! Poor shootin ' ! You ought to practice more . As for speed , I judge I can do six shots while you 're making four . But I thought I 'd best not -- to-day . Son , pick up your gun , and get your money from Shorty . " Mr. Jim picked up his gun and threw out the empty shells . He glared savagely at Mr. Johnson , now seated happily on his saddle . " If I just had hold of you -- you benched-legged hound ! Curse your soul , what do you mean by it ? " snarled Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded Pete lightly . " Thinkin ' how helpless I 'd be with you two big huskies , here with my gun empty . Do n't snicker , Bill ! That 's rude of you . Your pardner 's feeling plenty bad enough without that . He looks it . Mr. Bill , I 'll bet a blue shirt you told the Jim-person to wait and see if I would n't take a little siesta , and you 'd get me whilst I was snoozing . You lose , then . I never sleep . Tex , for the love of Mike , do look at Bill 's face ; and Bill , you look at Mr. Jim , from Texas ! Guilty as charged ! Your scheme , was it , Texas ? And Shorty Bill , he told you so ? Why , you poor toddling innocents , you wo n't never prosper as crooks ! Your faces are too honest . " And that frame-up of yours -- oh , that was a loo-loo bird ! Livin ' together and did n't know which was the best shot -- likely ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testifyin ' against you ! Think I 'm blind , hey ? Even your horses give you away . Never batted an eyelash durin ' that whole cannonade . They 've been hearin ' forty-fives pretty reg'lar , them horses have . " " I notice your old black ai n't much gun-shy , either , " ventured Bill . " See here -- you ! " said the big Texan . " You talk pretty biggity . It 's mighty easy to run a whizzer when you 've got the only loaded gun in camp . If I had one damned cartridge left it would be different . " " Never mind , " said Johnson kindly . " I 'll give you one ! " Rising , he twirled the cylinder of his gun and extracted his three cartridges . He threw one far down the hillslope ; he dropped one on the ground beside him ; he tossed the last one in the sand at the Texan 's feet . Jim , from Texas , looked at the cartridge without animation ; he looked into Pete Johnson 's frosty eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em down right here , " he stated firmly . " I like a damned fool ; but you suit me too well . " He stalked away toward his horse with much dignity . He stopped halfway , dropped upon a box , pounded his thigh and gave way to huge and unaffected laughter ; in which Bill joined a moment later . " Oh , you little bandy-legged old son-of-a-gun ! " Jim roared . " You crafty , wily , cunnin ' old fox ! I 'm for you ! Of all the holy shows , you 've made Bill and me the worst -- 'specially me . ' There , there ! ' you says , consolin ' me up like I was a kid with a cracked jug . ' There , there ! Never mind -- I 'll give you one ! ' Deah , oh , deah ! I 'll never be able to keep this still -- never in the world . I 'm bound to tell it on myself ! " He wiped tears from his eyes and waved his hand helplessly . " Take the ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch you if you was solid gold and charges prepaid . " " Oh , do n't make a stranger of me ! " begged Pete . " You was callin ' me by the name of Johnson half an hour ago . Forgot yourself , likely . " " Did I ? " said Jim indifferently . " No odds . You 've got my number , anyway . And I thought we was so devilish sly ! " " Well , boys , thank you for the dinner and all ; but I 'd best be jogging . Got to catch that train . " Knitting his brows reflectively he turned a questioning eye upon his hosts . But Shorty Bill took the words from his mouth . " I 'm like Jim : I 've got a-plenty , " he said . " But there 's a repeating rifle in the shack , if you do n't want to risk us . You can leave it at Silverbell for us if you want to -- at the saloon . And we can ride off the other way , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best -- considerin ' , " said Pete . " I 'll leave the gun . " " See here , Johnson , " said Jim stiffly . " We 've thrown ' em down , fair and square . I think you might trust us . " Pete scratched his head in some perplexity . " I think maybe I might if it was only myself to think of . But I 'm representing another man 's interest too . I ai n't takin ' no chances . " " Yes -- I noticed you was one of them prudent guys , " murmured Jim . Pete ignored the interruption . " So , not rubbin ' it in or anything , we 'd best use Bill 's plan . You lads hike off back the way I come , and I 'll take your rifle and drag it . So long ! Had a good time with you . " " Adios ! " said Bill , swinging into the saddle . " Hold on , Bill ! Give Johnson back his money , " said Jim . " Oh , you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the finish . " " Look here -- what do you think I am ? You take this money , or I 'll be sore as a boil . There ! So long , old hand ! Be good ! " He spurred after Bill . Mr. Johnson brought the repeater from the dugout and saddled old Midnight . As he pulled the cinches tight , he gazed regretfully at his late companions , sky-lined as they topped a rise . " There ! " said Mr. Johnson with conviction . " There goes a couple of right nice boys ! " CHAPTER II The immemorial traditions of Old Spain , backed by the counsel of a brazen sun , made a last stand against the inexorable centuries : Tucson was at siesta ; noonday lull was drowsy in the corridors of the Merchants and Miners Bank . Green shades along the south guarded the cool and quiet spaciousness of the Merchants and Miners , flooded with clear white light from the northern windows . In the lobby a single client , leaning on the sill at the note-teller 's window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Castilian influence had reduced the office force , at this ebb hour of business , to a spruce , shirt-sleeved young man , green-vizored as to his eyes , seated at a mid-office desk , quite engrossed with mysterious clerical matters . The office force had glanced up at Mr. Johnson 's first entrance , but only to resume its work at once . Such industry is not the custom ; among the assets of any bank , courtesy is the most indispensable item . Mr. Johnson was not unversed in the ways of urbanity ; the purposed and palpable incivility was not wasted upon him ; nor yet the expression conveyed by the back of the indefatigable clerical person -- a humped , reluctant , and rebellious back . If ever a back steeled itself to carry out a distasteful task according to instructions , this was that back . Mr. Pete Johnson sighed in sympathy . The minutes droned by . A clock , of hitherto unassuming habit , became clamorous ; it echoed along the dreaming corridors . Mr. Johnson sighed again . The stone sill upon which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience ; but if the patient face had noted its own reflection it might have remarked -- and adjusted -- eyebrows not so patient , flattened to a level ; and a slight quiver in the tip of a predatory nose . The pen squeaked across glazed paper . Mr. Johnson took from his pocket a long , thin cigar and a box of safety matches . The match crackled , startling in the silence ; the clerical person turned in his chair and directed at the prospective customer a stare so baleful that the cigar was forgotten . The flame nipped Johnson 's thumb ; he dropped the match on the tiled floor and stepped upon it . The clerk hesitated and then rose . " He loves me -- he loves me not ! " murmured Mr. Johnson sadly , plucking the petals from an imaginary daisy . The clerk sauntered to the teller 's wicket and frowned upon his customer from under eyebrows arched and supercilious ; he preserved a haughty silence . Before this official disapproval Peter 's eyes wavered and fell , abashed . " I'll -- I 'll stick my face through there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he faltered . The official eyebrows grew arrogant . " You are wasting my time . Have you any business here ? " " Ya-as . Be you the cashier ? " " His assistant . " " I 'd like to borrow some money , " said Pete timidly . He tucked away the unlit cigar . " Two thousand . Name of Johnson . Triangle E brand -- Yavapai County ! Two hundred Herefords in a fenced township . Three hundred and twenty acres patented land . Sixty acres under ditch . I 'd give you a mortgage on that . Pete Johnson -- Peter Wallace Johnson on mortgages and warrants . " " I do not think we would consider it . " " Good security -- none better , " said Pete . " Good for three times two thousand at a forced sale . " " Doubtless ! " The official shoulders shrugged incredulity . " I 'm known round here -- you could look up my standing , verify titles , and so on , " urged Pete . " I could not make the loan on my own authority . " Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gans , then ? " he persisted . " He 's out to luncheon . " " Be back soon ? " " I really could not say . " " I might talk to Mr. Longman , perhaps ? " " Mr. Longman is on a trip to the Coast . " Johnson twisted his fingers nervously on the onyx sill . Then he raised his downcast eyes , lit with a fresh hope . " Is -- is the janitor in ? " he asked . " You are pleased to be facetious , sir , " the teller replied . His lip curled ; he turned away , tilting his chin with conscious dignity . Mr. Johnson tapped the sill with the finger of authority . " Young man , do you want I should throw this bank out of the window ? " he said severely . " Because if you do n't , you uncover some one a grown man can do business with . You 're suffering from delusions of grandeur , fair young sir . I almost believe you have permitted yourself to indulge in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I note any more light-hearted conduct on your part I 'll shake myself and make merry with you till you 'll think the roof has done fell on you . Now you dig up the Grand Panjandrum , with the little round button on top , or I 'll come in unto you ! Produce ! Trot ! " The cashier 's dignity abated . Mr. Johnson was , by repute , no stranger to him . Not sorry to pass this importunate borrower on to other hands , he tapped at a door labeled " Vice-President , " opened it , and said something in a low voice . From this room a man emerged at once -- Marsh , vice-president , solid of body , strong of brow . Clenched between heavy lips was a half-burned cigar , on which he puffed angrily . " Well , Johnson , what 's this ? " he demanded . " You got money to sell ? I want to buy some . Let me come in and talk it up to you . " " Let him in , Hudson , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he listened to Johnson 's proposition . It appeared that Johnson 's late outburst of petulance had cleared his bosom of much perilous stuff . His crisp tones carried a suggestion of lingering asperity , but otherwise he bore himself with becoming modesty and diffidence in the presence of the great man . He stated his needs briskly and briefly , as before . " Money is tight , " said Marsh curtly . He scowled ; he thrust his hands into his pockets as if to guard them ; he rocked back upon his heels ; his eyes were leveled at a point in space beyond Pete 's shoulder ; he clamped his cigar between compressed lips and puffed a cloud of smoke from a corner of a mouth otherwise grimly tight . Mr. Peter Johnson thought again of that unlit cigar , came swiftly to tiptoe , and puffed a light from the glowing tip of Marsh 's cigar before that astonished person could withdraw his gaze from the contemplation of remote infinities . The banker recoiled , flushed and frowning ; the teller bent hastily over his ledger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guileless face . Marsh shook his head and made a bear-trap mouth . " Why do n't you go to Prescott , Johnson ? There 's where your stuff is . They know you better than we do . " " Why , Mr. Marsh , I do n't want to go to Prescott . Takes too long . I need this money right away . " " Really -- but that is hardly our affair , is it ? " A frosty smile accompanied the query . " Aw , what 's wrong ? Is n't that security all right ? " urged Pete . " No doubt the security is exactly as you say , " said the banker , " but your property is in another county , a long distance from here . We would have to make inquiries and send the mortgage to be filed in Prescott -- very inconvenient . Besides , as I told you before , money is tight . We regret that we can not see our way to accommodate you . This is final ! " " Shucks ! " said Pete , crestfallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brim between his hands . " That is final , " repeated the banker . " Was there anything else ? " " A check to cash , " said Pete humbly . He went back into the lobby , much chastened ; the spring lock of the door snapped behind him . " Wait on this gentleman , if you please , Mr. Hudson , " said Marsh , and busied himself at a cabinet . Hudson rose from his desk and moved across to the cashier 's window . His lip curved disdainfully . Mr. Johnson 's feet were brisk and cheerful on the tiles . When his face appeared at the window , his hat and the long black cigar were pushed up to angles parallel , jaunty and perilous . He held in his hand a sheaf of papers belted with a rubber band ; he slid over the topmost of these papers , face down . " It 's endorsed , " he said , pointing to his heavy signature . " How will you have it , sir ? " Hudson inquired with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Pete . Hudson flipped over the check . The sneer died from his face . His tongue licked at his paling lips . " What does this mean ? " he stammered . " Ca n't you read ? " said Pete . The cashier did not answer . He turned and called across the room : " Mr. Marsh ! Mr. Marsh ! " Marsh came quickly , warned by the startled note in the cashier 's voice . Hudson passed him the check with hands that trembled a little . The vice-president 's face mottled with red and white . The check was made to the order of P.W . Johnson ; it was signed by Henry Bergman , sheriff of Pima County , and the richest cowman of the Santa Cruz Valley ; the amount was eighty-six thousand dollars . Marsh glowered at Johnson in a cold fury . " Call up Bergman ! " he ordered . Hudson made haste to obey . " Oh , that 's all right ! I 'd just as soon wait , " said Pete cheerfully . " Hank 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd want to ask about the check . " " He should have notified us before drawing out any such amount , " fumed Marsh . " This is most unusual , for a small bank like this . He told us he should n't need this money until this fall . " " Draft on El Paso will do . Do n't have to have cash . " " All very well -- but it will be a great inconvenience to us , just the same . " " Really -- but that is hardly our affair , is it ? " said Pete carelessly . The banker smote the shelf with an angry hand ; some of the rouleaus of gold stacked on the inner shelf toppled and fell ; gold pieces clattered on the floor . " Johnson , what is your motive ? What are you up to ? " " It 's all perfectly simple . Old Hank and me used to be implicated together in the cow business down on the Concho . One of the Goliad Bergmans -- early German settlers . " Here Hudson hung up and made interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reported . Johnson resumed his explanation : " As I was sayin ' , I reckon I know all the old-time cowmen from here to breakfast and back . Old Joe Benavides , now -- one of your best depositors ; I fished Joe out of Manzanillo Bay thirty year back . He was all drowned but Amen . " Wetting his thumb he slipped off the next paper from under the rubber band . Marsh eyed the sheaf apprehensively and winced . " Got one of Joe 's checks here , " Pete continued , smoothing it out . " But maybe I wo n't need to cash it -- to-day . " " Johnson , " said the vice-president , " are you trying to start a run on this bank ? What do you want ? " " My money . What the check calls for . That is final . " " This is sheer malice . " " Not a bit of it . You 're all wrong . Just common prudence -- that 's all . You see , I needed a little money . As I was tellin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cash just now ; nor any comin ' till steer-sellin ' time . So I come down to Tucson on the rustle . Five banks in Tucson ; four of ' em , countin ' yours , turned me down cold . " " If you had got Bergman to sign with you --  " Marsh began . " Tell that to the submarines , " said Pete . " Good irrigated land is better than any man 's name on a note ; and I do n't care who that man is . A man might die or run away , or play the market . Land stays put . Well , after my first glimpse of the cold shoulder I ciphered round a spell . I 'm a great hand to cipher round . Some one is out to down me ; some one is givin ' out orders . Who ? Mayer Zurich , I judged . He sold me a shoddy coat once . And he wept because he could n't loan me the money I wanted , himself . He 's one of these liers-in-wait you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you till the last , bein ' as Zurich was one of your directors . I studied some more -- and then I hunted up old Hank Bergman and told him my troubles , " said Pete suavely . " He expressed quite some considerable solicitude . ' Why , Petey , this is a shockin ' disclosure ! ' he says . ' A banker is a man that makes a livin ' loanin ' other people 's money . Lots of marble and brass to a bank , salaries and other expenses . Show me a bank that 's quit lendin ' money and I 'll show you a bank that 's due to bust , muy pronto ! I got quite a wad in the Merchants and Miners , ' he says , ' and you alarm me . I 'll give you a check for it , and you go there first off to-morrow and see if they 'll lend you what you need . You got good security . If they ai n't lendin ' , ' he says , ' then you just cash my check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lose the interest for only four days , ' he says -- 'last Monday , the fifteenth , being my quarter day . Hold out what you need for yourself . ' " ' I do n't want any , ' says I. ' The First National say they can fit me out by Wednesday if I ca n't get it before . Man do n't want to borrow from his friends , ' says I. ' Then put my roll in the First National , ' says Hank . That 's all ! Only -- I saw some of the other old-timers last night . " Pete fingered his sheaf significantly . " You have us ! " said Marsh . " What do you want ? " " I want the money for this check -- so you 'll know I 'm not permeated with any ideas about heaping coals of fire on your old bald head . Come through , real earnest ! I 'll see about the rest . Exerting financial pressure is what they call this little racket you worked on me , I believe . It 's a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mull or meddle with my affairs again I 'll turn another check . That 's for your official information -- so you can keep the bank from any little indiscretions . I 'm telling you ! This is n't blackmail . This is directions . Sit down and write me a draft on El Paso . " Marsh complied . Peter Johnson inspected the draft carefully . " So much for the bank for to-day , the nineteenth , " said Pete . " Now a few kind words for you as the individual , Mr. George Marsh , quite aside from your capacity as a banker . You report to Zurich that I applied for a loan and you refused it -- not a word more . I 'm tellin ' you ! Put a blab on your office boy . " He rolled his thumb at young Hudson . " And hereafter if you ever horn in on my affairs so much as the weight of a finger tip -- I 'm tellin ' you now !  - -  I 'll appear to you ! " CHAPTER III The world was palpably a triangle , baseless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range , gateless , on the east ; a gray range on the west , broken , spiked , and bristling . At the northern limit of vision the two ranges closed together to what seemed relatively the sharp apex of the triangle , the mere intersection of two lines . This point , this seemingly dimensionless dot , was in reality two score weary miles of sandhills , shapeless , vague , and low ; waterless , colorless , and forlorn . Southward the central desert was uninhabitable ; opinions differed about the edges . Still in Arizona , the eye wearied ; miles and leagues slid together to indistinguishable inches . Then came a low line of scattered hills that roughly marked the Mexican border . The mirage played whimsical pranks with these outpost hills . They became , in turn , cones , pyramids , boxes , benches , chimney stacks , hourglasses . Sometimes they soared high in air , like the kites of a baby god ; and , beneath , the unbroken desert stretched afar , wavering , misty , and dim . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin , icy , cameo-sharp ; beyond , between , faint golden splotches of broad Sonoran plain faded away to nothingness ; and , far beyond that nothingness , hazy Sonoran peaks of dimmest blue rose from illimitable immensities , like topmasts of a very large ship on a very small globe ; and the earth was really round , as alleged . It was fitting and proper that the desert , as a whole , had no name : the spinning earth itself has none . Inconsiderable nooks and corners were named , indeed -- Crow Flat , the Temporal , Moonshine , the Rinconada . It should rather be said , perhaps , that the desert had no accepted name . Alma Mater , Lungs called it . But no one minded Lungs . Mr. Stanley Mitchell woke early in the Blue Bedroom to see the morning made . He threw back the tarpaulin and sat up , yawning ; with every line of his face crinkled up , ready to laugh for gladness . The morning was shaping up well . Glints of red snapped and sparkled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clean skies . A jerky clatter of iron on rock echoed from the cliffs . That was the four hobbled horses , browsing on the hillside : they snuffed and snorted cheerfully , rejoicing in the freshness of dawn . From a limestone bluff , ten feet behind the bed , came a silver tinkle of falling water from a spring , dripping into its tiny pool . Stan drew in a great breath and snuffed , exactly as the horses snuffed and from the same reason -- to express delight ; just as a hungry man smacks his lips over a titbit . Pungent , aromatic , the odor of wood smoke alloyed the taintless air of dawn . The wholesome smell of clean , brown earth , the spicy tang of crushed herb and shrub , of cedar and juniper , mingled with a delectable and savory fragrance of steaming coffee and sizzling , spluttering venison . Pete Johnson sat cross-legged before the fire . This mess of venison was no hit-or-miss affair ; he was preparing a certain number of venison steaks , giving to each separate steak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying . " Whoo-hoo-oo ! This is the life ! " he proclaimed . Orisons more pious have held less gratitude . He tugged on one boot , reached for the other -- and then leaped to his feet like a jack-in-the-box . With the boot in his hand he pointed to the south . High on the next shadowy range , thirty miles away , a dozen scattered campfires glowed across the dawn . " What the Billy-hell ? " he said , startled . " Stan-ley ! " " I will say wallop ! I wo n't be a lady if I ca n't say wallop ! " quoth Stan rebelliously . " What 's doing over at the Gavilan ? There 's never been three men at once in those fiend-forsaken pinnacles before . Hey ! S'pose they 've struck it rich , like we did ? " " I 'm afraid not , " sighed Pete . " You toddle along and wash um 's paddies . She 's most ripe . " With a green-wood poker he lifted the lid from the bake-oven . The biscuit were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lid and slid it into the glowing heart of the fire ; he raked out a new bed of coals and lifted the little three-legged bake-oven over them ; with his poker he skillfully flirted fresh coals on the rimmed lid and put it back on the oven . He placed the skillet of venison on a flat rock at his elbow and poured coffee into two battered tin cups . Breakfast was now ready , and Pete raised his voice in the traditional dinner call of the ranges : " Come and get it or I 'll throw it out ! " Stanley came back from a brisk toilet at Ironspring . He took a preliminary sip of coffee , speared a juicy steak , and eyed his companion darkly . Mr. Johnson plied knife and fork assiduously , with eyes downcast and demure . Stanley Mitchell 's smooth young face lined with suspicion . " When you 've been up to some deviltry I can always tell it on you -- you look so incredibly meek and meechin ' , like a cat eatin ' the canary , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the sugar ! Now what warlockry is this ? " He jerked a thumb at the far-off fires . " What 's the merry prank ? " Mr. Johnson sighed again . " Deception . Treachery . Mine . " He looked out across the desert to the Gavilan Hills with a complacent eye . " And breach of trust . Mine , again . " " Who you been betrayin ' now ? " " Just you . You and your pardner ; the last bein ' myself . You know them location papers of ours I was to get recorded at Tucson ? " Stanley nodded . " Well , now , " said Pete , " I did n't file them papers . Something real curious happened on the way in -- and I reckon I 'm the most superstitious man you ever see . So I tried a little experiment . Instead , I wrote out a notice for that little old ledge we found over on the Gavilan a month back . I filed that , just to see if any one was keeping cases on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Tucson : You see what 's happened . " He waved his empty coffee-cup at the campfires . " I come right back and we rode straight to Ironspring . But there 's been people ridin ' faster than us -- ridin ' day and night . Son , if our copper claims had really been in the Gavilan , instead of a-hundred-and-then-some long miles in another-guess direction -- then what ? " " We 'd have found our claim jumped and a bunch to swear they 'd been working there before the date of our notices ; that they did n't find the scratch of a pick on the claim , no papers and no monument -- that 's what we 'd have found . " " Correct ! Pass the meat . " " But we have n't told a soul , " protested Stanley . " How could any one know ? We all but died of thirst getting back across the desert -- the wind rubbed out our tracks ; we laid up at Soledad Springs a week before any one saw us ; when we finally went in to Cobre no one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even that we 'd been looking for anything . How could any one know ? " " This breakfast is getting cold , " said Pete Johnson . " Good grub hurts no one . Let 's eat it . Then I 'll let a little ray of intelligence filter into your darkened mind . " Breakfast finished , Stan piled the tin dishes with a clatter . " Now then , old Greedy ! Break the news to me . " Pete considered young Stan through half-closed lids -- a tanned , smooth-faced , laughing , curly-headed , broad-shouldered young giant . " You got any enemies , pardner ? " " Not one in the world that I know of , " declared Stan cheerfully . " Back in New York , maybe ? " " Not a one . No reason to have one . " Pete shook his head reflectively . " You 're dreadful dumb , you know . Think again . Think hard . Take some one 's girl away from him , maybe ? " " Not a girl . Never had but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . " " Ya-as . Back in New York . I 've posted letters to her : Abingdon P.O. Name of Selden . " Stanley went brick red . " That 's her . I 'm her Joe . And when we get this little old bonanza of ours to grinding she wo n't be in New York any more . Come again , old-timer . What 's all this piffle got to do with our mine ? " " If you only had a little brains , " sighed Johnson disconsolately , " I 'd soon find out who had it in for you , and why . It 's dreadful inconvenient to have a pardner like that . Why , you poor , credulous baa-lamb of a trustful idiot , when you let me go off to file them papers , do n't you see you give me the chance to rob you of a mine worth , just as she stands , ' most any amount of money you chance to mention ? Not you ! You let me ride off without a misgivin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tommyrot ! Pickles ! " Pete wagged a solemn forefinger . " If you was n't plumb simple-minded and trustin ' you would ' a ' tumbled long ago that somebody was putting a hoodoo on every play you make . I caught on before you 'd been here six months . I thought , of course , you 'd been doin ' dirt to some one -- till I come to know you . " " I thank you for those kind words , " grinned Mitchell ; " also , for the friendly explanation with which you cover up some bad luck and more greenhorn 's incompetence . " " No greenhorn could be so thumbhandsided as all that , " rejoined Pete earnestly . " Your irrigation ditches break and wash out ; cattle get into your crops whenever you go to town ; but your fences never break when you 're round the ranch . Notice that ? " " I did observe something of that nature , " confessed Mitchell . " I laid it to sheer bad luck . " The older man snorted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you went off by your lonesome and tried cattle . Your windmills broke down ; your cattle was stole plumb opprobrious -- Mexicans blamed , of course . And the very first winter the sheep drifted in on you -- where no sheep had never blatted before -- and eat you out of house and home . " " I sold out in the spring , " reflected Stanley . " I ran two hundred head of stock up to one hundred and twelve in six months . Go on ! Your story interests me , strangely . I begin to think I was not as big a fool as I thought I was , and that it was foolish of me to ever think my folly was --  " Johnson interrupted him . " Then you bought a bunch of sheep . Son , you ca n't realize how great-minded it is of me to overlook that slip of yours ! You was out of the way of every man in the world ; you was on your own range , watering at your own wells -- the only case like that on record . And the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your herder and stampeded your woollies over a bluff . " " Sheep outrages have happened before , " observed Stan , rather dryly . " Sheep outrages are perpetrated by cowmen on cow ranges , " rejoined Pete hotly . " I guess I ought to know . Sheepmen are n't ever killed on their own ranges ; it is n't respectable . Sheepmen are all right in their place -- and hell 's the place . " " Peter ! " said Stan . " Such langwidge ! " " Wallop ! Wallop ! " barked Peter , defiant and indignant . " I will say wallop ! Now you shut up whilst I go on with your sad history . Son , you was afflicted some with five-card insomnia -- and right off , when you first came , you had it fair shoved on you by people usually most disobligin ' . It was n't just for your money ; there was plenty could stack ' em higher than you could , and them fairly achin ' to be fleeced , at that . If your head had n't been attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't figured to be about square , or maybe rectangular , you had a chance to be a poker fiend or a booze hoist . " " You 're spoofing me , old dear . Wake up ; it 's morning . " " Do n't fool yourself , son . There was a steady organized effort to get you in bad . And it took money to get all these people after your goat . Some one round here was managin ' the game , for pay . But't was n't no Arizona head that did the plannin ' . Any Rocky Mountain roughneck mean enough for that would ' a ' just killed you once and been done with it . No , sir ; this party was plumb civilized -- this guy that wanted your goat . He wanted to spoil your rep ; he probably had conscientious scruples about bloodshed . Early trainin ' , " said Mr. Johnson admiringly , " is a wonderful thing ! And , after they found you would n't fall for the husks and things , they went out to put a crimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain by putting you on the blink , huh ? " " No one at all , " said Stan . " You 're seein ' things at night ! What happened on the Cobre Trail to stir up your superstitions ? " " Two gay young lads -- punchers of Zurich's -- tried to catch me with my gun unloaded . That 's what ! And if herdin ' with them blasted baa-sheep had n't just about ruined your intellect , you 'd know why , without asking , " said Pete . " Look now ! I was so sure that you was bein ' systematically hornswoggled that , when two rank strangers made that sort of a ranikiboo play at me , I talked it out with myself , like this -- not out loud -- just me and Pete colloguing : " ' These gentlemen are pickin ' on you , Pete . What 's that for ? ' ' Why , ' says Pete , ' that 's because you 're Stan 's pardner , of course . These two laddie-bucks are some small part of the gang , bunch , or congregation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tryin ' to put over on Stan now ? ' I asks , curiosity getting the better of my good manners . ' Not to pry into private matters any , ' says I , ' but this thing is getting personal . I can feel malicious animal magnetism coursin ' through every vein and leapin ' from crag to crag , ' says I. ' A joke 's a joke , and I can take a joke as well as any man ; but when I 'm sick in my bed , and the undertaker comes to my house and looks into my window and says , " Darlin ' ! I am waitin ' for thee ! "  - -  that 's no joke . And if Stanley Mitchell 's facetious friends begin any hilarity with me I 'll transact negotiations with ' em -- sure ! So I put it up to you , Petey -- square and aboveboard -- what are they tryin ' to work on Stan now ? ' " ' To get his mine , you idjit ! ' says Pete . ' Now be reasonable , ' says I. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Did n't you tote a sample out of that blisterin ' old desert ? ' says Pete . ' We did , ' I admits , ' just one little chunk the size of a red apple -- and it weighed near a couple of ton whilst we was perishin ' for water . But we stuck to it closer than a rich brother-in-law , ' says I. ' You been had ! ' jeers Pete . ' What kind of talk is this ? You caught that off o ' Thorpe , over on the Malibu -- you been had ! Talk United States ! Do you mean I 've been bunked ? ' I spoke up sharp ; but I was feelin ' pretty sick , for I just remembered that we did n't register that sample when we mailed it to the assayer . " ' Your nugget 's been seen , and sawed , and smeltered . Got that ? As part of the skulduggery they been slippin ' to young Stan , your package has been opened , ' says Petey , leerin ' at me . ' Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest mine in Arizona ! ' I says , with my teeth chatterin ' so that I stammers . ' Gosh , no ! Else the coyotes would be pickin ' your bones , ' says Pete . ' They know you 've got some rich ore , but they figure it to be some narrow , pinchin ' , piddlin ' little vein somewheres . How can they guess you found a solid mountain of the stuff ? ' " ' Sufferin ' cats ! ' says I. ' Then is every play I make -- henceforth and forever , amen -- to be gaumed up by a mess of hirelin ' bandogs ? Persecutin ' Stan was all very well -- but if they take to molesting me any , it 's going to make my blood fairly boil ! Is some one going to draw down wages for makin ' me mizzable all the rest of my whole life ? ' ' No such luck , ' says Petey . ' Your little ore package was taken from the mail as part of the system of pesterin ' Stanley -- but , once the big boss-devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he throwed up his employer and his per diem , and is now operating roundabout on his own . They take it you might have papers about you showing where your claim is -- location papers , likely . That 's all ! These ducks , here , want to go through you . Nobody wants to kill you -- not now . Not yet -- any more than usual . But , if you ask me , ' said Petey , ' if they ever come to know as much about that copper claim as you know , they 'll do you up . Yes , sir ! From ambush , likely . So long as they are dependin ' on you to lead them to it , you 're safe from that much , maybe . After they find out where it is -- cuidado ! ' " ' But who took that package out of the mail , Petey ? It might have been any one of several or more -- old Zurich , here at Cobre ; or the postmaster at Silverbell ; or the postal clerks on the railroad ; or the post-office people at El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool , ' says Pete to me ; ' and you lie like a thief . You know who it was , same as I do -- old C. Mayer Zurich , grand champion lightweight collar-and-elbow grafter and liar , cowman , grubstaker , general storekeeper , postmaster , and all-round crook , right here in Cobre -- right here where young Stanley 's been gettin ' ' em dealt from the bottom for three years . Them other post-office fellows never had no truck with Stanley -- never so much as heard of him . Zurich 's here . He had the disposition , the motive , the opportunity , and the habit . Besides , he sold you a shoddy coat once . Forgotten that ? ' " Pete paused to glower over that coat ; and young Mitchell , big-eyed and gasping , seized the chance to put in a word : " You 're an ingenious old nightmare , pardner -- you almost make it convincing . But Great Scott , man ! Ca n't you see that your fine , plausible theory is all built on surmise and wild conjecture ? You have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Whilst I was first a-constructing this ingenious theory your objection might have carried force ; for I did n't have a fact to stand on , as you observe . I conjectured round pretty spry , too . Reckon it took me all of half a second -- while them two warriors was giving me the evil eye . I 'll tell you how it was . " He related the story of the shooting match and the lost bet . " And to this unprovoked design against an inoffensive stranger I fitted the only possible meaning and shape that would make a lick of sense , dovetailin ' in with the real honest-to-goodness facts I already knew . " " But do n't you see , old thing , you 're still up in the air ? Your theory does n't touch ground anywhere . " " Stanley -- my poor deluded boy !  - -  when I got to the railroad I wired that assayer right off . Our samples never reached El Paso . So I wrote out my fake location and filed it . See what followed that filing -- over yonder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fires , Stanley . If they had n't been there we 'd have gone on to our mine . Now we 'll go anywhere else . " " Well , I 'll just be teetotally damned ! " Stanley remarked with great fervor . " Trickling into your thick skull , is it ? Son , get a piece of charcoal . Now you make black marks on that white rock as I tell you , to hold down my statements so they do n't flutter away with the wind . Ready ? Number One : Our copper samples did n't reach the assayer -- make a long black mark ... Therefore -- make a short black mark ... Number Two : Either Old Pete 's crazy theory is correct in every particular -- a long black mark ... Or -- now a short black mark ... Number Three : The assayer has thrown us down -- a long black mark ... Number Four : Which would be just as bad -- make a long black mark . " CHAPTER IV Stanley Mitchell looked hard at the long black mark ; he looked out along the south to the low line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sun peering suddenly over the Comobabi Range . " Well -- and so forth ! " he said . " Here is a burn from the branding ! And what are we going to do now ? " " Wash the dishes . You do it . " " You are a light-minded and frivolous old man , " said Stan . " What are we going to do about our mine ? " " I 've done told you . We -- per you -- are due to wash up the dishes . Do the next thing next . That 's a pretty good rule . Meantime I will superintend and smoke and reflect . " " Do your reflecting out loud , ca n't you ? " said Stan . His smooth forehead wrinkled and a sudden cleft appeared between his eyebrows , witness of an unaccustomed intentness of thought . " Say , Pete ; this partnership of ours is n't on the level . You put in half the work and all the brains . " " ' Sall right , " said Pete Johnson . " You furnish the luck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm pickin ' up some considerable education from you , learning how to pronounce words like that -- pulchritude . I mispronounced dreadful , I reckon . " " I can tell you how to not mispronounce half as many words as you do now , " said Stan . " How 's that ? " said Pete , greatly interested . " Only talk half so much . " " Fair enough , kid ! It would work , too . That ai n't all , either . If I talked less you 'd talk more ; and , talking more , you 'd study out for yourself a lot of the things I tell you now , gettin ' credit from you for much wisdom , just because I hold the floor . Go to it , boy ! Tell us how the affairs of We , Us &; Company size up to you at this juncture . " " Here goes , " said Stan . " First , we do n't want to let on that we 've got anything at all on our minds -- much less a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual mention of discontent that we 've sent off rock to an assayer and not heard from it . Not to say a word would make our conspirators more suspicious ; a careless mention of it might make them think our find was n't such-a-much , after all . Say ! I suppose it would n't do to pick up a collection of samples from the best mines round Cobre -- and inquire round who to write to for some more , from Jerome and Cananea , maybe ; and then , after talking them up a while , we could send one of these samples off to be assayed , just for curiosity -- what ? " " Bear looking into , " said Pete ; " though I think they 'd size it up as an attempt to throw ' em off the trail . Maybe we can smooth that idea out so we can do something with it . Proceed . " " Then we 'll have to play up to that location you filed by hiking to the Gavilan and going through the motions of doing assessment work on that dinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older man 's eyes . Pete nodded approval . " But , Pete , are n't we taking a big chance that some one will find our claim ? It is n't recorded , and our notice will run out unless we do some assessment work pretty quick . Suppose some one should stumble onto it ? " " Well , we 've got to take the chance , " said Pete . " And the chance of some one stumbling on our find by blind luck , like we did , is n't a drop in the bucket to the chance that we 'll be followed if we try to slip away while these fellows are worked up with the fever . Seventy-five thousand round dollars to one canceled stamp that some one has his eye glued on us through a telescope right this very now ! I would n't bet the postage stamp on it , at that odds . No , sir ! Right now things shape up hotter than the seven low places in hell . " If we go to the mine now -- or soon -- we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ el mundo ! " " Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird , " Mitchell quoted soberly . " So you think that after a while , when their enthusiasm dies down , we can give them the slip ? " " Sure ! It 's our only chance . " " Could n't we make a get-away at night ? " " It is what they are hoping for . They 'd follow our tracks . No , sir ! We do nothing . We notice nothing , we suspect nothing , and we have nothing to hide . " " You want to remember that our location notice will be running out pretty soon . " " We 'll have to risk it . Not so much of a risk , either . Cobre is the last outpost of civilization . South of here , in the whole strip from Comobabi to the Colorado River , there 's not twenty men , all told , between here and the Mexican border -- except yonder deluded wretches in the Gavilan ; and none beyond the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one big lonesome needle-in-the-haystack proposition -- and no one has any idea where our find is , not within three days ' ride . But what puzzles me is this : If Zurich really got wise to our copper , he 'd know at once that it was a big thing , if there was any amount of it . Then why did n't he keep it private and confidential ? Why tip it off to the G.P. ? I have always understood that in robbery and murder , one is assisted only by intimate friends . What is the large idea ? " " That , I take it , " laughed Pete , " is , in some part , an acknowledgment that it does n't take many like you and me to make a dozen . You 've made one or two breaks and got away with ' em , the last year or two , that has got ' em guessing ; and I 'm well and loudly known myself . There is a wise old saying that it 's no use sending a boy to mill . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and sanitary . They sized it up that to dispatch only two or three men to adjust such an affair with us would be in no way respectful or segacious . " Also , in a gang of crooks like that , every one is always pullin ' for his buddy . That accounts for part of the crowd -- prudence and a far-reaching spirit of brotherly love . For the rest , when the first ten or six made packs and started , they was worked up and oozing excitement at every pore . Then some of the old prospectors got a hunch there was something doing ; so they just naturally up stakes and tagged along . Always doing that , old miner is . That 's what makes the rushes and stampedes you hear about . " " Then we 're to do nothing just now but to shun mind-readers , write no letters , and not talk in our sleep ? " " Just so , " agreed Pete . " If my saddle could talk , I 'd burn it . That 's our best lay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in the world is to hunt for a man that is n't there ; the next worst is to watch a man that has nothing to conceal . And our little old million-dollar-a-rod hill is the unlikeliest place to look for a mine I ever did see . Just plain dirt and sand . No indications ; just a plain freak . I 'd sooner take a chance in the pasture lot behind pa 's red barn -- any one would . We covered up all the scratchin ' we did and the wind has done the rest . Here -- you was to do the talkin ' . Go on . " " What we really need , " declared Mitchell , " is an army -- enough absolutely trustworthy and reliable men to overmatch any interference . " " The largest number of honest men that was ever got together in one bunch , " said Pete , " was just an even eleven . Judas Iscariot was the twelfth . That 's the record . For that reason I 've always stuck it out that we ought to have only ten men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest , somehow . But suppose we found ten honest men somewheres . It might be done . I know where there 's two right here in Arizona , and I 've got my suspicions of a third -- honest about portable property , that is . With cattle , and the like , they do n't have any hard-and-fast rule ; just consider each case on its individual merits . How the case of automobiles would strike them elder ethics is one dubious problem . Standing still , or bein ' towed , so it might be considered as a wagon , a car would be safe enough ; but proceedin ' from hither to yon under its own power -- I du n no . I 'll make a note of it . Well , you get the right idea for the first thing . Honest men wanted ; no questions asked . And then what ? " " Money . " " You 've said it , kid ! We could quitclaim that hill for a million cash to-morrow --  " " If we had any claim to quit , " interrupted Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rub its nose in our hill . " " That 's the word I was feelin ' for -- capital . It 's capital we want , Stanley -- not money . I could get a little money myself down at Tucson . Them two honest men of mine live there . We used to steal cattle together down on the Concho -- the sheriff and Jose Benavides and me . I aim to feed ' em a slice of my share , anyway -- but what they could put in would n't be a drop in the bucket . We want to go after capital . There 's where you come in . Got any rich friends back East ? " Stan reflected . " My cousin , Oscar Mitchell , is well-to-do , but hardly what you would call rich , in this connection , " he said . " But he is in touch with some of the really big men . We could hardly find a better agent to interest capital . " " Will he take the first steps on your bare word -- without even a sample or an assayer 's report ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , then . Here 's where you come in . I had this in mind , " declared Johnson , " when I first throwed in with you . I knew we could find the mine and you 'd be needed for bait to attract capital . I rustled a little expense money at Tucson . Say , I did n't tell you about that . Listen ! " He recited at length his joyous financial adventures in Tucson . " But wo n't your man Marsh tell Zurich about your unruly behavior ? " said Stan at the finish . " I think not . He 's got too much to lose . I put the fear of God in his heart for fair . I could n't afford to have him put Zurich on his guard . It wo n't do to underestimate Zurich . The man 's a crook ; but he 's got brains . He has n't overlooked a bet since he came here . Zurich is Cobre -- or mighty near it . He 's in on all the good things . Big share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got all the water supply grabbed and is makin ' a fortune from that alone . He runs the store , the post-office , and the stage line . He 's got the freight contracts and the beef contracts . He 's got brains . Only one weak point about him -- he 'll underestimate us . We got brains too . Zurich knows that , but he do n't quite believe it . That 's our chance . " " Just what will you ask my cousin to do ? And when shall I go ? " " Day before to-morrow . You hike back to Cobre and hit the road for all points East , I 'll go over to the Gavilan to be counted -- take this dynamite and stuff , and make a bluff at workin ' , keeping my ears open and my mouth not . Pledge cousin to come see when we wire for him -- as soon as we get possession . If he finds the sight satisfactory , we 'll organize a company , you and me keepin ' control . We 'll give ' em forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want nine percent for my Tucson friends , who 'll put up a little preliminary cash and help us with the first fightin ' , if any . Make your dicker on that basis ; take no less . If your cousin ca n't swing it , we 'll go elsewhere . " Tell him our proposition would be a gracious gift at two millions , undeveloped ; but we 're not selling . Tell him there 'll be a million needed for development before there 'll be a dollar of return . There 's no water ; just enough to do assessment work on , and that to be hauled twenty-five miles from those little rock tanks at Cabeza Prieta . Deep drillin ' may get water -- I hope so . But that will take time and money . There 'll have to be a seventy-five-mile spur of railroad built , anyway , leaving the main line somewhere about Mohawk : we 'd just as well count on hauling water from the Gila the first year . Them tanks will about run a ten-man gang a month after each rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell him one claim , six hundred feet by fifteen hundred , will pretty near cover our hill ; but we 'll stake two for margin . We do n't want any more ; but we 'll have to locate a town site or something , to be sure of our right of way for our railroad . Every foot of these hills will be staked out by some one , eventually . If any of these outside claims turns out to be any good , so much the better . But there ca n't be the usual rush very well -- 'cause there ai n't enough water . We 'll have to locate the tanks and keep a guard there ; we 'll have to pull off a franchise for our little jerkwater railroad . " We got to build a wagon road to Mohawk , set six-horse teams to hauling water , and other teams to hauling water to stations along the road for the teams that haul water for us . All this at once ; it 's going to be some complicated . " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first camp ; another for lawyers ; patentin ' three claims ; haul water seventy-five miles , no road , and part of that through sand ; minin ' machinery ; build a railroad ; smelter , maybe -- if some one would kindly find coal . " We want a minimum of five hundred thousand ; as much more for accidents . Where does this cousin of yours live ? In Abingdon ? " " In Vesper -- seven miles from Abingdon . He 's a lawyer . " " Is he all right ? " " Why , yes -- I guess so . When I was a boy I thought he was a wonderful chap -- rather made a hero of him . " " When you was a boy ? " echoed Johnson ; a quizzical twinkle assisted the query . " Oh , well -- when he was a boy . " " He 's older than you , then ? " " Nearly twice as old . My father was the youngest son of an old-fashioned family , and I was his youngest . Uncle Roy -- Oscar 's father -- was dad 's oldest brother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " I 'm sorry about that , too . I 'd be better pleased if he was round your age . No offense to you , Stan ; but I 'd name no places to your cousin if I were you . When we get legal possession let him come out and see for himself -- leadin ' a capitalist , if possible . " " Oscar 's all right , I guess , " protested Stan . " But you ca n't do more than guess ? Name him no names , then . I wish he was younger , " said Peter with a melancholy expression . " The world has a foolish old saying : ' The good die young . ' That 's all wrong , Stanley . It is n't true . The young die good ! " CHAPTER V Something Dewing , owner of Cobre 's Emporium of Chance , sat in his room in the Admiral Dewey Hotel . It was a large and pleasant room , refitted and over-furnished by Mr. Dewing at the expense of his fellow townsmen , grateful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the tongues of the scurrile , " Something , " as a praise-name and over-name for Mr. Dewing , suffered a sea change to " Surething "  - -  Surething Dewing ; just as the Admiral Dewey Hotel was less favorably known as " Stagger Inn . " Mr. Dewing 's eye rested dreamily upon the picture , much praised of connoisseurs , framed by his window -- the sharp encircling contours of Cobre Mountain ; the wedge of tawny desert beyond Farewell Gap . Rousing himself from such contemplation , he broke a silence , sour and unduly prolonged . " Four o'clock , and all 's ill ! Johnson is not the man to be cheated out of a fortune without putting up a fight . Young Mitchell himself is neither fool nor weakling . He can shoot , too . We have had no news . Therefore -- a conclusion that will not have escaped your sagacity -- something has gone amiss with our little expeditionary force in the Gavilan . Johnson is quite the Paladin ; but he could hardly exterminate such a bunch as that . It is my firm conviction that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good and workmanlike manner . " The Johnson-Mitchell firm is now Johnson , Mitchell &; Company , our late friends , or the survivors , being the Company . " These remarks were addressed to the elder of Mr. Dewing 's two table mates . But it was Eric Anderson , tall and lean and lowering , who made answer . " You may set your uneasy mind at rest , Mr. Something . Suspectin ' treachery comes natural to you -- being what you are . " " There -- that 's enough ! " This was the third man , Mayer Zurich . He sprang up , speaking sharply ; a tall , straight man , broad-shouldered , well proportioned , with a handsome , sparkling , high-colored face . " Eric , you grow more insolent every day . Cut it out ! " Mr. Dewing , evenly enough , shifted his thoughtful gaze upon tall Eric , seemingly without resentment for the outburst . " Well , was n't he insultin ' the boys then ? " demanded Eric . " I guess you 're right , there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of taking so many of them in on this proposition ; but I 'm not afraid of them doin ' me dirt , now they 're in . I do n't see why the three of us could n't have kept this to ourselves -- but Something had to blab it out ! Why he should do that , and then distrust the very men he chose for so munificent a sharing of a confidence better withheld -- that is quite beyond my understanding . Dewing , you would never have clapped an eye on that nugget if I had suspected in you so unswerving a loyalty to the gang . I confess I was disappointed in you -- and I count you my right-hand man . " The speech of the educated man , in Mr. Zurich , was overlaid with colloquialism and strange idiom , made a second tongue by long familiarity . " Your left-hand man ! " Dewing made the correction with great composure . " You come to me to help you , because , though you claim all the discredit for your left-handed activities , I furnish a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegantly phrased it -- because I am far too intelligent to bite a bulldog for a bone . Our friends in the Gavilan pride themselves on their nerve . They are fighting men , if you please -- very fearless and gallant . That suits me . I am no gentleman . Quite the contrary . I am very intelligent , as afore-said . It was the part of prudence --  " " That is a very good word -- prudence . " The interpolation came from tall Eric . " A very good word , " assented the gambler , unmoved . " It was the part of prudence to let our valiant friends and servants pull these chestnuts from the fire , as aforetime . To become the corpse of a copper king is a prospect that holds no attractions for me . " " But why -- why on earth -- did you insist on employing men you now distrust ? you bewilder me , Dewing , " declared Zurich . " What 's the idea -- to swindle yourself ? " " You will do me the justice to remember , " observed Dewing with a thin-lipped smile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a desirable preliminary to our operations , to remove Mr. Peter Johnson from this unsatisfactory world without any formal declaration of war . " " I wo n't do it ! " declared Zurich bluntly . " And -- damn you -- you sha n't do it ! He 's a dangerous old bow-legged person , and I wish he was farther . And I must admit that I am myself most undesirous for any personal bickering with him . To hear Jim Scarboro relate it , old Pete is one wiz with a six-gun . All the same , I 'll not let him be shot from ambush . He 's too good for that . I draw the line there . I 'm not exactly afraid of the little old wasp , either , when it comes down to cases ; but I have great respect for him . I 'll never agree to meet him on a tight rope over Niagara and make him turn back ; and if I have any trouble with him he 's got to bring it to me . You have no monopoly of prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Something Dewing spread out his fine hands . " You made no allowance for my loyalty and I made none for your scruples . As a result , Mr. Johnson has established a stalemate , held a parley , and bought off our warriors . They 've been taken in on the copper find , on some small sharing , while we , in quite another sense of the word , are simply taken in . Such , " observed Mr. Dewing philosophically , " is the result of inopportune virtues . " " Bosh ! I told you all along , " said Anderson heavily , " that there 's no mineral in the Gavilan . I 've been over every foot of it -- and I 'm a miner . We get no news because no man makes haste to announce his folly . You 'll see ! " " Creede and Cripple Creek had been prospected over and over again before they struck it there , " objected Zurich . " Silver and gold ! " retorted Eric scornfully . " This is copper . Copper advertises . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's been no battle , and no treachery , and no mine found . We 've been trapped . That Gavilan location was a fake , stuck up to draw our fire . We 've tipped our hand . Mr. Johnson can now examine the plans of mice or men that your combined sagacities have so obligingly placed face upward before him , and decide his policies at his leisure . If I were in his shoes , this is what I would be at : I 'd tell my wondrous tale to big money . And then I would employ very many stranger men accustomed to arms ; and when I went after that mine , I would place under guard any reasonable and obliging travelers I met , and establish a graveyard for the headstrong . And that 's what Johnson will do . He 'll go to the Coast for capital , at the same time sendin ' young Stanley back to his native East on the same errand . " " You may be right , " said Zurich , somewhat staggered . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cananea , or they would never have taken a precaution so extraordinary as a false location . What on earth can have happened to rouse their suspicions to that extent ? " " Man , I wonder at you ! " said tall Eric . " You put trust in your brains , your money , and your standing to hold you unstained by all your left-handed business . You expect no man to take heed of you , when the reek of it smells to high heaven . Well , you deceive yourself the more . These things get about ; and they are none so unobserving a people , south of the Gila , where ' t is fair life or death to them to note betweenwhiles all manner of small things -- the set of a pack , the tongue of a buckle , the cleat of a mine ladder . And your persecution of young Stanley , now . Was you expectin ' that to go unremarked ? ' T is that has made Peter Johnson shy of all bait . ' T was a sorry business from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in it . And for every thousand of that dirty money we now stand to lose a million . " " ' T was a piker 's game , " sneered Dewing . " Not worth the trouble and risk . We had about three thousand from Zurich to split between us ; little enough . Of course Zurich kept his share , the lion 's share . " " You got the middleman 's chunk , at any rate , " retorted Zurich . " I did the middleman 's work , " said the gambler tranquilly . " Now , gentlemen , we have not been agreeing very well of late . Eric , in particular , has been far from flattering in his estimates of my social and civic value . We are agreed on that ? Very well . I may have mentioned my intelligence ? And that I rate it highly ? Yes ? Very well , then . I shall now demonstrate that my self-appraisal was justified by admitting that my judgment on this occasion was at fault . Eric 's theories as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out ; they prove themselves . The same is true of his very direct and lucid statement as to the nature and cause of the difficulties which now beset us . I now make the direct appeal to you , Eric : As a candid man or mouse , what would you do next ? " Tall Eric bent his brows darkly at the gambler . " If you mean that I fear the man Johnson at all , why do you not use tongue and lips to say that same ? I am not greatly chafed by an open enemy , but I am no great hand to sit down under a mock . " " It was your own word -- the mice , " said Dewing . " But this time you take me wrongly . I meant no mockery . I ask you , in good faith , for your opinion . What ought to be done to retrieve the false step ? " " Could we find this treasure-trove by a painstaking search of the hills ? " asked Zurich doubtfully . " It 's a biggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've prospected out there for fifteen years and I 've scarce made a beginning . If we 're to find Johnson 's strike before Johnson makes a path to it , we have a month , at most . Find it , says you ? Sure , we might find it . But if we do it will be by blind fool-hog luck and not by painstakin ' search . Do you search , if you like . My word would be to try negotiations . Make a compromise with Johnson . And if your prudence does not like the errand , I will even take it upon myself . " " What is there to compromise ? We have nothing to contribute . " " We have safety to sell , " said Eric . " Seek out the man and state the case baldly : ' Sir , we have protection to sell , without which your knowledge is worthless , or near it . Protection from ourselves and all others . Make treaty with us ; allot to us , jointly , some share , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by you . So shall you avoid delay . You may avoid some risk . Quien sabe ? If you refuse we shall truly endeavor to be interestin ' ; and you may get nothing . ' That 's what I would say . " " A share , to be named by Johnson and then be divided between ten ? Well , I guess not ! " declared Zurich . " To begin with , we 'll find a way to stop Kid Mitchell from any Eastern trip . Capital is shy ; I 'm not much afraid of what Johnson can do . But this boy has the inside track . " " With my usual astuteness , " remarked Something Dewing , " I had divined as much . And there is another string to our bow if we make a complete failure of this mine business -- as would seem to be promised by the Gavilan fiasco . When such goodly sums are expended to procure the downfall of Kid Mitchell -- an event as yet unexpectedly delayed -- there 's money in it somewhere . Big money ! I know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown benefactor shall have my every assistance to attain his hellish purpose -- hellish purpose , I believe , is the phrase proper to the complexion of this affair . Then , to use the words of the impulsive Hotspur , slightly altered to suit the occasion , I 'll creep upon him while he lies asleep , and in his ear I 'll whisper -- Snooks ! " " You do n't know where he lives , " said Zurich . " Ah , but you do ! I beg your pardon , Zurich -- perhaps in my thoughtlessness I have wounded you . I used the wrong pronoun . I did not mean to say ' I '  - -  much less ' you '  - -  in reference to who should hollo ' Halves ! ' to our sleeping benefactor . ' We ' was the word I should have used . " Zurich regarded Mr. Dewing in darkling silence ; and that gentleman , in no way daunted , continued gayly : " I see that the same idea has shadowed itself to you . You must consider us -- Eric and I -- equals in that enterprise , friend Mayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have sadly underestimated Eric -- you and I. By our own admission -- and his -- he is a better fighting man than either of us . You would n't want to displease him . " " I think you go about it in an ill way to remedy a mistake , Dewing , " said Zurich . " Do n't let 's be silly enough to fall out over one chance gone wrong . We 've got all we can attend to right now , without such a folly as that . Do n't mind him , Eric . Tell me , rather , what we are going to do about this troublesome Johnson ? Violence is out of the question : we need him to show us where he found that copper . Besides , it is n't safe to kill old Pete , and it never has been safe to kill old Pete . As for the Kid , I 'll do what I have been urged to do this long time by the personage who takes so kindly an interest in his fortunes -- I 'll railroad him off to jail , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond question , lost to us . It is n't wise to let him go East ; he might get hold of unlimited money . If he did , forewarned as he is now , Johnson would fix it so we should n't have a look-in . You turn this over and let me know your ideas . " " And that reminds me , " said Dewing with smooth insolence , equally maddening to both hearers , " that Eric 's ideas have been notably justified of late ; whereas your ideas -- and mine -- have been stupid blunders from first to last . You see me at a stand , friend Mayer , doubtful if it were not the part of wisdom to transfer my obedience to Eric hereafter . " " For every word of that , Johnson would pay you a gold piece , and have a rare bargain of it . " Zurich 's voice was hard ; his eye was hard . " Is this a time for quarreling among ourselves ? There may be millions at stake , for all we know , and you would set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little peevish boy . I 'm ashamed of you ! Get your horse and ride off the sulks . If you feel spiteful , take it out on Johnson . Get yourself a pack outfit and go find his mine . " " I 'm no prospector , " said the gambler disdainfully . " No . I will tell you what you are . " Tall Eric rose and towered above Dewing at the window ; the sun streamed on his bright hair , " You are a crack-brained fool to tempt my hands to your throat ! You will do it once too often yet . You a prospector ? You never saw the day you had the makin 's of a prospector in you . " " Let other men do the work and take the risk while I take the gain , and it 's little I care for your opinion , " rejoined Dewing . " And you would do well to keep your hands from my throat when my hand is in my coat pocket -- as is the case at this present instant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zurich . " Anderson , come back and sit down . Dewing , go and fork that horse of yours and ride the black devil out of your heart . " " I have a thing to say , first , " said Eric . " Dewing , you sought to begowk me by setting me up against Zurich -- or perhaps you really thought to use me against him . Well , you wo n't ! When we want the information about the man that has been harryin ' young Mitchell , Zurich will tell us . We know too much about Zurich for him to deny us our askings . But , for your mock at me , I want you both to know two things : The first is , I desire no headship for myself ; the second is this -- I take Zurich 's orders because I think he has the best head , as a usual thing ; and I follow those orders exactly so far as I please , and no step more . I am mean and worthless because I choose to be and not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " " If you 're quite through , " said Dewing , " I 'll take that ride . " The door closed behind him . " Disappointed ! Had his mouth fixed for a million or so , and did n't get it ; could n't stand the gaff ; made him ugly , " said Zurich slowly . " And when Dewing is ugly he is unbearable ; absolutely the limit . " " Is n't he ? " agreed Eric in disgust . " Enough to make a man turn honest . " CHAPTER VI Stanley Mitchell topped the last rise in Morning Gate Pass in the late afternoon . Cobre Basin spread deep and wide before him , ruddy in the low sun ; Cobre town and mines , on his left , loomed dim and misshapen in the long dark shadows of the hills . Awguan , top horse and foreman of Stanley 's mount , swung pitapat down the winding pass at a brisk fox trot . The gallop , as a road gait , is frowned upon in the cow countries as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Folly , high above the trail -- gray , windowless , and forlorn ; the trail dipped into the cool shadows , twisted through the mazy deeps of Wait-a-Bit Canon , clambered zigzag back to the sunlit slope , and curved round the hillsides to join , in long levels , the wood roads on the northern slopes . As he turned into the level , Stanley 's musings were broken in upon by a sudden prodigious clatter . Looking up , he became aware of a terror , rolling portentous down the flinty ridge upon him ; a whirlwind streak of billowed dust , shod with sparks , tipped by a hurtling color yet unknown to man ; and from the whirlwind issued grievous words . Awguan leaped forward . Bounding over boulders or from them , flashing through catclaw and ocatillo , the appearance swooped and fell , the blend disjoined and shaped to semblance of a very small red pony bearing a very small blue boy . The pony 's small red head was quite innocent of bridle ; the bit was against his red breast , held there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headstall flapped rakishly about the red legs . Making the curve at sickening speed , balanced over everlasting nothingness for a moment of breathless equipoise , they took the trail . Awguan thundered after . Stanley bent over , pelted by flying pebbles and fragments of idle words . Small chance to overhaul the prodigy on that ribbed and splintered hill ; Awguan held the sidelong trail at the red pony 's heels . They dipped to cross an arroyo ; Stan lifted his head and shouted : " Fall off in the sand ! " " Damnfido ! " wailed the blue boy . Sand flashed in rainbow arches against Awguan 's brown face -- he shut his eyes against it ; they turned up the hill beyond . A little space ahead showed free of bush or boulder . Awguan took the hillside below the trail , lowered his head , laid his ears back , and bunched his mighty muscles . He drew alongside ; leaning far over , heel to cantle , Stan threw his arm about the small red neck , and dragged the red pony to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twisted the soft bridle rein once and again to a miraculous double half-hitch about the red pony 's jaw , and tightened it with a jerk . " I 've got him ! " shrieked the blue boy . The red pony turned mild bright eyes upon brown Awguan , and twitched red velvet ears to express surprise , and wrinkled a polite nose . " Hello ! I had n't noticed you before . Fine day , is n't it ? " said the ears . Awguan rolled his wicked eye and snorted . The blue boy shrilled a comment of surprising particulars -- a hatless boy in denim . Stanley turned his head at a clatter of hoofs ; Something Dewing , on the trail from town , galloped to join them . " That was a creditable arrest you made , Mitchell , " he said , drawing rein . " I saw it all from the top of Mule Hill . And I certainly thought our Little Boy Blue was going to take the Big Trip . He 'll make a hand ! " The gambler 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Little Boy Blue , who , concurrently with the above speech , quavered forth his lurid personal opinions of the red pony . He was a lean , large-eyed person , apparently of some nine or ten years -- which left his vocabulary unaccounted for ; his face was smeared and bleeding , scratched by catclaw ; his apparel much betattered by the same reason . He now checked a flood of biographical detail concerning the red pony long enough to fling a remark their way : " Ai n't no Boy Blue -- damn your soul ! Name 's Robteeleecarr ! " Dewing and Mitchell exchanged glances . " What 's that ? What did he say ? " " He means to inform you , " said Dewing , " that his name is Robert E. Lee Carr . " His glance swept appraisingly up the farther hill , and he chuckled : " Old Israel Putnam would be green with envy if he had seen that ride . Some boy ! " " He must be a new one to Cobre ; I 've never seen him before . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a notorious character already . So is Nan-na . " " Nan-na , I gather , being the pony ? " " Exactly . Little Apache devil , that horse is . Robert 's dad , one Jackson Carr , is going to try freighting . He 's camped over the ridge at Hospital Springs , letting his horses feed up and get some meat on their bones . Here ! Robert E. Lee , drop that club or I 'll put the dingbats on you instanter ! Do n't you pound that pony ! I saw you yesterday racing the streets with the throat-latch of your bridle unbuckled . Serves you right ! " Robert E. Lee reluctantly abandoned the sotol stalk he had been breaking to a length suitable for admonitory purposes . " All right ! But I 'll fix him yet -- see if I do n't ! He 's got to pack me back up that hill after my hat . Gim me a knife , so 's I can cut a saddle string and mend this bridle . " These remarks are expurgated . He mended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle back . Stan , dismounting , made a discovery . " I 've lost a spur . Thought something felt funny . Noticed yesterday that the strap was loose . " He straightened up from a contemplation of his boot heel ; with a sudden thought , he searched the inner pocket of his coat . " And that is n't all . By George , I 've lost my pocketbook , and a lot of money in it ! But it ca n't be far ; I 've lost it somewhere on my boy chase . Come on , Dewing ; help me hunt for it . " They left the boy at his mending and took the back track . Before they had gone a dozen yards Dewing saw the lost spur , far down the hill , lodged under a prickly pear . Stanley , searching intently for his pocketbook , did not see the spur . And Dewing said nothing ; he lowered his eyelids to veil a sudden evil thought , and when he raised them again his eyes , which for a little had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tense and hard . Robert E. Lee Carr clattered gayly by them and pushed up the hill to recover his hat . The two men rode on slowly ; a brown pocketbook upon a brown hillside is not easy to find . But they found it at last , just where Stanley had launched his pursuit of the hatless horseman . It had been jostled from his pocket in the first wild rush . Stanley retrieved it with a sigh of relief . " Are you sure you had your spur here ? " asked Dewing . " Maybe you lost it before and did n't notice it . " " Oh , never mind the spur , " said Stan . " I 'm satisfied to get my money . Let 's wait for Little Boy Blue and we 'll all go in together . " " Want to try a little game to-night ? " suggested Dewing . " I could use that money of yours . It seems a likely bunch -- if it 's all money . Pretty plump wallet , I call it . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold in me a reformed character . " " Stick to that , boy , " said Dewing . " Gambling is bad business . " It grew on to dusk when Robert E. Lee Carr rejoined them ; it was pitch dark when they came to the Carr camp-fire at Hospital Springs , close beside the trail ; when they reached Cobre , supper-time was over . At the Mountain House Stanley ordered a special supper cooked for him , with real potatoes and cow milk . Dewing refused a drink , pleading his profession ; and Stanley left his fat wallet in the Mountain House safe . " Well , I 'll say good-night now , " said Dewing . " See you after supper ? " " Oh , I 'll side you a ways yet . Goin ' up to the shack to unsaddle . Always like to have my horse eat before I do . And you 'll not see me after supper -- not unless you are up at the post-office . I 'm done with cards . " " I 'd like to have a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not about cards . Business . I 'm sick of cards , myself . I 'll never be able to live ' em down -- especially with this pleasing nickname of mine . I want to talk trade . About your ranch : you 've still got your wells and water-holes ? I was thinking of buying them of you and going in for the straight and narrow . I might even stock up and throw in with you -- but you would n't want a partner from the wrong side of the table ? Well , I do n't blame you -- but say , Stan , on the level , it 's a funny old world , is n't it ? " " I 'm going to take the stage to-morrow . See you when I come back . I 'll sell . I 'm reformed about cattle , too , " said Stan . At the ball ground he bade Dewing good-night . The latter rode on to his own hostelry at the other end of town . Civilization patronized the Admiral Dewey as nearest the railroad ; mountain men favored the Mountain House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side street to the one-roomed adobe house on the edge of town that served as city headquarters for himself and Johnson . He unsaddled in the little corral ; he brought a feed of corn for brown Awguan ; he brought currycomb and brush and made glossy Awguan 's sleek sides , turning him loose at last , with a friendly slap , to seek pasture on Cobre Hills . Then he returned to the Mountain House for the delayed supper . Meantime Mr. Something Dewing held a hurried consultation with Mr. Mayer Zurich ; and forthwith took horse again for Morning Gate Pass , slipping by dark streets from the town , turning aside to pass Hospital Springs . Where the arrest of the red pony had been effected , Dewing dismounted ; below the trail , a dozen yards away , he fished Mr. Stanley Mitchell 's spur from under a prickly pear ; and returned in haste to Cobre . After his supper Stanley strolled into Zurich's -- The New York Store . Unknown to him , at that hour brown Awguan was being driven back to his little home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . Stanley exchanged greetings with the half-dozen customers who lingered at the counters , and demanded his mail . Zurich handed out two fat letters with the postmark of Abingdon , New York . While Stanley read them , Zurich called across the store to a purchaser of cigars and tobacco : " Hello , Wiley ! Thought you had gone to Silverbell so wild and fierce . " " Am a-going now , " said Wiley , " soon as I throw a couple or three drinks under my belt . " " Say , Bat , do you think you 'll make the morning train ? It 's going on nine now . " " Surest thing you know ! That span of mine can stroll along mighty peart . Once I get out on the flat , we 'll burn the breeze . " " Come over here , then , " said Zurich . " I want you to take some cash and send it down to the bank by express -- about eight hundred ; and some checks besides . I ca n't wait for the stage -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdrawn my account , with my usual carelessness , and I want this money to get to the bank before the checks do . " Stanley went back to his little one-roomed house . He shaved , bathed , laid out his Sunday best , re-read his precious letters , and dropped off to dreamless sleep . Between midnight and one o'clock Bat Wiley , wild-eyed and raging , burst into the barroom of the Admiral Dewey and startled with a tale of wrongs such part of wakeful Cobre as there made wassail . At the crossing of Largo Draw he had been held up at a gun 's point by a single robber on horseback ; Zurich 's money had been taken from him , together with some seventy dollars of his own ; his team had been turned loose ; it had taken him nearly an hour to catch them again , so delaying the alarm by that much . Boots and spurs ; saddling of horses ; Bob Holland , the deputy sheriff , was called from his bed ; a swift posse galloped into the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had retired early , but had been roused by the clamor . They came to Largo Crossing at daybreak . The trail of the robber 's horse led straight to Cobre , following bypaths through the mountains . The tracks showed plainly that his coming had been by these same short cuts , saving time while Bat Wiley had followed the tortuous stage road through the hills . Halfway back a heavy spur lay in the trail ; some one recognized it as Stanley Mitchell's -- a smith-wrought spur , painfully fashioned from a single piece of drill steel . They came to Cobre before sunup ; they found brown Awguan , dejected and sweat-streaked , standing in hip-shot weariness on the hill near his corral . In the corral Stanley 's saddle lay in the sand , the blankets sweat-soaked . Unwillingly enough , Holland woke Stan from a smiling sleep to arrest him . They searched the little room , finding the mate to the spur found on the trail , but nothing else to their purpose . But at last , bringing Stan 's saddle in before locking the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining , and found , between saddle skirt and saddle tree , the stolen money in full , and even the checks that Zurich had sent . They haled Stan before the justice , who was also proprietor of the Mountain House . Waiving examination , Stanley Mitchell was held to meet the action of the Grand Jury ; and in default of bond -- his guilt being assured and manifest -- he was committed to Tucson Jail . The morning stage , something delayed on his account , bore him away under guard , en route , most clearly , for the penitentiary . CHAPTER VII Mr. Peter Johnson 's arrival in Morning Gate Pass was coincident with that of a very bright and businesslike sun . Mr. Johnson had made a night ride from the Gavilan country , where he had spent the better part of a pleasant week , during which he had contrived to commingle a minimum of labor with a joyous maximum of innocent amusement . The essence of these diversions consisted of attempts -- purposely clumsy -- to elude the vigilance of such conspirator prospectors as yet remained to neighbor him ; sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected hours , ending always in the nothing they set out for , followed always by the frantic espionage of his mystified and bedeviled guardians -- on whom the need fell that some of them must always watch while their charge reposed from his labors . Tiring at last of this pastime , observing also that his playfellows grew irritable and desperate , Mr. Johnson had sagely concluded that his entertainment palled . Caching most of his plunder and making a light pack of the remainder , he departed , yawning , taking trail for Cobre in the late afternoon of the day preceding his advent in Morning Gate . He perched on the saddle , with a leg curled round the horn ; he whistled the vivacious air of Tule , Tule Pan , a gay fanfaronade of roistering notes , the Mexican words for which are , for considerations of high morality , best unsung . The pack-horses paced down the trail , far ahead , with snatched nibblings at convenient wayside tufts of grass . Jackson Carr , freighter , was still camped at Hospital Springs . He lifted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , rising , intercepted its coming at the forks of the trail , heading the pack-horses in toward his camp . He walked with a twisting limp , his blue eyes were faded and pale , his bearded face was melancholy and sad ; but as he seated himself on a stone and waited for Johnson 's coming , some of the sadness passed and his somber face lit up with unwonted animation . " Howdy , Pete ! I heard yuh was coming . I waited for yuh . " Pete leaped from his horse and gripped the freighter 's hand . " Jackson Carr , by all that 's wonderful ! Jack , old man ! How is it with you ? " Jackson Carr hesitated , speaking slowly : " Sally 's gone , Pete . She died eight years ago . She had a hard life of it , Pete . Gay and cheerful to the last , though . Always such a brave little trick ... " His voice trailed off to silence . It was long before Pete Johnson broke upon that silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack . Day before yesterday we was boys together in Uvalde an ' Miss Sally a tomboy with us . To-morrow will be no worse , as I figure it . " He looked hard at the hills . " It ca n't be all a silly joke . That would be too stupid ! No jolthead made these hills . It 's all right , I reckon .... And the little shaver ? He was only a yearlin ' when I saw him last . And I have n't heard a word about you since . " " Right as rain , Bobby is . Goin ' on ten now . Of course ' tai n't as if he had his mother to look after him ; but I do the best I can by him . Wish he had a better show for schoolin ' , though . I have n't been prosperin ' much -- since Sally died . Seems like I sorter lost my grip . But I aim to put Bobby in school here when it starts up , next fall . I am asking you no questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ask questions about you since I first heard you were here , four or five days ago . " " By hooky , Jack , I never expected to see you again . Where you been all these years ? And how 'd you happen to turn up here ? " " Never mind me , Pete . Here is too much talk of my affairs and none of yours . Man , I have news for your ear ! Your pardner 's in jail . " " Ya-as ? What 's he been doin ' now ? " " Highway robbery . He got caught with the goods on . Eight or nine hundred . " " The little old skeesicks ! Who 'd have thought it of him ? " said Pete tolerantly . Then his face clouded over . " He might have let me in on it ! " he complained . " Jack , you lead me to your grub pile and tell me all about it . Sounds real interestin ' . Where 's Bob ? He asleep yet ? " " Huh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatherly pride in no small degree . " Not him ! Lit out o ' here at break o ' day -- him and that devil horse of his , wrangling the work stock . He 's a mighty help to me . I ai n't very spry on my pins since -- you know . " To eke out the words he gave an extra swing to his twisted leg . They came to a great freight wagon under a tree , with tackle showing that it was a six-horse outfit . " Here we are ! ' Light down and unsaddle , Petey , and we 'll take off the packs . Turn your horses loose . Bobby 'll look out for them when he comes . No need to hobble . There ! Wash up ? Over yonder 's the pan . I 'll pour your coffee and one for myself . I 've eaten already . Pitch in ! " Pete equipped himself with tinware and cutlery , doubled one leg under and sat upon it before the fire . From the ovens and skillets on the embers Pete heaped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried rabbit , and canned corn fried to a delicate golden brown . Pete took a deep draught of the unsweetened hot black coffee , placed the cup on the sand beside him , and gathered up knife and fork . From the farther side of the fire Carr brought another skillet , containing jerky , with onions and canned tomatoes . " From the recipe of a nobleman in the county , " he said . " Now , then , " said Pete , " tell it to me . " So Carr told him at length the story of the robbery and Stanley Mitchell 's arrest , aided by a few questions from Pete . " And the funny thing is , there 's a lot of folks not so well satisfied yet , for all they found the money and notwithstandin ' the young feller himself did n't make no holler . They say he was n't that kind . The deputy sher'f , ' special , says he do n't believe but what it was a frame-up to do him . And Bull Pepper , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he : ' That money was put there a-purpose to be found ; fixed so it would n't be missed . ' " He looked a question . " Ya-as , " said Pete . Thus encouraged , Carr continued : " And Old Mose Taylor , at the Mountain House -- Mitchell got his hearin ' before him , you know -- he says Mitchell ai n't surprised or excited or much worried , and makes no big kick , just sits quiet , a-studyin ' , and he 's damned if he believes he ever done it . Oh , yes ! Mose told me if I see you to tell you young Mitchell left some money in the safe for you . " " Ya-as , " said Pete . " Here comes your caballada . Likely looking horses , Jack . " " A leetle thin , " said Carr . He took six nose-bags , already filled , and fed his wagon stock . Bobby pulled the saddle from the Nan-na pony , tied him to a bush , and gave him breakfast from his own small morral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over here , " said Bobby 's father . " This is your stepuncle Pete . " Bobby complied . He gave Pete a small grimy hand and looked him over thoughtfully from tip to tip , opening his blue eyes to their widest for that purpose , under their long black lashes . " You Stan Mitchell 's pardner ? " " I am that . " " You goin ' to break him out o ' the pen ? " " Surest thing you know ! " said Pete . " That 's good ! " He relaxed his grip on Pete 's hand and addressed himself to breakfast . " I like Stan , " he announced , with his head in the chuck-box . Pete used the opportunity to exchange a look with Bobby 's father . Bobby emerged from the chuck-box and resumed the topic of Stanley Mitchell . " He 'll make a hand after he 's been here a spell -- Stan will , " he stated gravely . " Oh , you know him , then ? " " I was with him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't steal no money ! " " What makes you think so ? " " Easy ! He 's got brains , hai n't he ? I rode with him maybe a mile , but I could see that . Well ! If he 'd stole that money , they would n't ' a ' found it yet . Them fellows make me tired ! " Pete made a pretext of thirst and brought a bucket for water from the spring , crooking a finger at Jackson Carr to follow . Carr found him seated at the spring , shaking with laughter . " Jack , he 's all there -- your boy ! Could n't any judge size it up better . " " Frame-up , then ? " " Sure ! That part 's all right . " " I see you was n't much taken aback . " " No . We was expectin ' something like that and had discounted it . I 'm just as well pleased Stan 's in jail just now , and I 'm goin ' to leave him there a spell . Safer there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , Hank 's the sheriff here -- and he 'll give us a square deal . Now I 'm goin ' back to interview that boy of yours some more . I reckon you 're right proud of that kid , Jack . " " Yes ; I am . Bobby 's a pretty good boy most ways . But he swears something dreadful . " " Pull a strap off of him , " said Pete warmly . " That 's a damn fine boy , and you want to start him right . That 's half the battle . " Pete returned to the fire for a final cup of coffee . " Young man , " he said , " would you know that brown horse Stan was ridin ' when you met up with him ? " " Awguan ? Sure ! I 'd know him in hell ! " said Bobby . " Well , Stan turned that horse loose to rustle for himself , of course . Do you reckon you could stir round and find him for me -- if your dad can spare you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Awguan , he 's fresh . My horses are tired . " " If you do n't want that horse , " said Bobby , " do n't send me after him . " " Now , Jack , " said Pete after Bobby had departed on the search for Awguan , " you go away and do n't pester me . I want to think . " To the processes of thought , for the space of four pipes , he gave aid by hugging his knees , as if he had called them in consultation . Then he summoned Jackson Carr . " How 're you fixed for work , Jack ? " " None . I reckon to get plenty , though , when I get my teams fitted up . They 're jaded from a lumber job . " " You 're hired -- for a year , month , and day . And as much longer as you like . Suit you ? " " Suits me . " " You 're my foreman , then . Hire your teams the first thing . Make your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big thing . A mine -- a he-mine ; copper . That 's partly why Stan is in jail . And if it comes off , you wo n't need to worry about the kid 's schooling . I aim to give you , extra , five per cent of my share -- and , for men like you and me , five per cent of this lay is exactly the same as all of it . It 's that big . " I 'm askin ' you to obey orders in the dark . If you do n't know any details you wo n't be mad , and you wo n't know who to be mad at ; so you wo n't jump in to save the day if I fail to come through with my end of it on schedule , and get yourself killed off . That ai n't all , either . Your face always gives you away ; if you knew all the very shrewd people I 'm buckin ' , you 'd give ' em the marble eye , and they 'd watch you . Not knowin ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you wo n't act suspicious . " Listen now : You drift out quiet and go down on the Gila , somewhere between Mohawk Siding and Walton . Know that country ? Yes ? That 's good . Leave your teams there and you go down to Yuma on the train . I 'll get a bit of money for you in Tucson , and it 'll be waitin ' for you in Old Man Brownell 's store , in Yuma . You get a minin ' outfit , complete , and a good layout of grub , enough to last six or seven men till it 's all gone , and some beddin ' , two or three thirty-thirty rifles , any large quantity of cartridges , and ' most anything else you see . " Here 's the particular part : Buy two more wagons , three-and-a-half-inch axles ; about twenty barrels ; two pack-saddles and kegs for same , for packing water from some tanks when your water wagons do n't do the trick . Ship all this plunder up to Mohawk . " Here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm comin ' back soon . Me and my friends -- not a big bunch , but every man-jack of ' em to be a regular person -- are goin ' to start from Tucson , or Douglas , and hug the Mexican border west across the desert , ridin ' light and fast ; you 're to go south with water ; and Cobre is to be none the wiser . Here , I 'll make you a map . " He traced the map in the sand . " Here 's the railroad , and Mohawk ; here 's your camp on the Gila . Just as soon as you get back , load up one of your new wagons with water and go south . There 's no road , but there 's two ranges that makes a lane , twenty miles wide , leadin ' to the southeast : Lomas Negras , the black mountain due south of Mohawk , and Cabeza Prieta , a brown-colored range , farther west . Keep right down the middle , but miss all the sand you can ; you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heap . Only , of course , you can straighten it out and better it after you learn the country . It might be a pious idea for you to ship up a mowing machine and a hayrake from Yuma , like you was fixin ' to cut wild hay . It 's a good plan always to leave something to satisfy curiosity . Or , play you was aimin ' to dry-farm . You shape up your rig to suit yourself -- but play up to it . " " I 'll hay it , " said Carr . " All right -- hay it , by all means . Take your first load of water out about twenty-five miles and leave it -- using as little as you can to camp on . You 'll have to have three full sets of chains and whiffle trees for your six-horse team , of course . You ca n't bother with dragging a buckboard along behind to take ' em back with . Go back to the railroad , take a second load of water , camp the first night out at your first wagon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles or so . " Then go back to the Gila and pack the rest of your plunder in this wagon of yours , all ready to start the minute you get a telegram from me . Wire back to me so I 'll know when to start . You will have water for your horses at twenty-five miles and fifty , and enough left to use when you go back for your next trip . After that we 'll have other men to help you . " When you leave the last wagon , put on all the water your horses can draw . You 'll strike little or no sand after that and we 'll need all the water we can get . With no bad luck , you come out opposite the south end of your black mountain the third day . Wait there for us . It 's three long days , horseback , from Tucson ; we ought to get to your camp that night . " If we do n't come , wait till noon the next day . Then saddle up , take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south end of the mountains on your west , about twenty miles . That ought to leave enough water at the wagon for us to camp on if we come later . If you wait for us , your horses will use it all up . " When you come to the south end of your Cabeza Prieta Mountain , right spang on the border , you 'll find a canon there , coming down from the north , splitting the range . Turn up that canon , and when it gets so rough you ca n't go any farther , keep right on ; you 'll find some rock tanks full of water , in a box where the sun ca n't get ' em . That 's all . Got that ? " " I 've got it , " said Carr . " But Pete , are n't you taking too long a chance ? Why ca n't I -- or both of us -- just slip down there quietly and do enough work on your mine to hold it ? They 're liable to beat you to it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , " said Pete earnestly ; " but I am far too intelligent . These people are capable of any rudeness . And they are strictly on the lookout . I do not count myself timid , but I do n't want to tackle it . That mine ai n't worth over six or eight millions at best . " " But they wo n't be watching me , " said Carr . " Maybe not . I hope not . For one thing , you 'll have a good excuse to pull out from Cobre . You wo n't get any freighting here . Old Zurich has got it all grabbed and contracted for . All you could get would be a subcontract , giving you a chance to do the work and let Zurich take the profit . " Now , to come back to this mine : No one knows where it is . It 's pretty safe till I go after it ; and I 'm pretty safe till I go after it . Once we get to it , it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  - -  night and day , till we get legal title . And it 's going to take slews of money and men and horses to get water and supplies to those miners and warriors . Listen : One or the other of two things -- two -- is going to happen . Count ' em off on your fingers . Either no one will find that mine before me and my friends meet up with you and your water , or else some one will find it before then . If no one finds it first , we 've lost nothing . That 's plain . But if my Cobre friends -- the push that railroaded Stan to jail -- if they should find that place while I 'm back in New York , and little Jackson Carr working on it -- Good-bye , Jackson Carr ! They 'd kill you without a word . That 's another thing I 'm going back to New York for besides getting money . There 's something behind Stanley 's jail trip besides the copper proposition ; and that something is back in New York . I 'm going to see what about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come , and you have to strike out for the tanks in Cabeza Mountain , you 'll notice a mess of low , little , insignificant , roan-colored , squatty hills spraddled along to the south of you . You shun them hills , bearing off to your right . There 's where our mine is . And some one might be watching you or following your tracks . That 's all . Now I 'm going to sleep . Wake me about an hour by sun . " * * * * * Mr. Peter Johnson sat in the office of the Tucson Jail and smiled kindly upon Mr. Stanley Mitchell . " Well , you got here at last , " said Stan . " Gee , but I 'm glad to see you ! What kept you so long ? " " Stanley , I am surprised at you . I am so . You keep on like this and you 're going to have people down on you . Too bad ! But I suppose boys will be boys , " said Pete tolerantly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Stan . " Take your time . " " I 'm afraid it 's you that will take time , my boy . Ca n't you dig up any evidence to help you ? " " I do n't see how . I went to sleep and did n't hear a thing ; did n't wake up till they arrested me . " " Oh ! You 're claiming that you did n't do the robbin ' at all ? I see-e ! Standing on your previous record and insistin ' you 're the victim of foul play ? Sympathy dodge ? ... Hum ! You stick to that , my boy , " said Pete benevolently . " Maybe that 's as good a show as any . Get a good lawyer . If you could hire some real fine old gentleman and a nice little old gray-haired lady to be your parents and weep at the jury , it might help a heap .... If you 'd only had sense enough to have hid that money where it could n't have been found , or where it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I suppose you was scared . But it sorter reflects back on me , since you 've been running with me lately . Folks will think I should have taught you better . What made you do it , Stanley ? " " I suppose you think you 're going to get me roiled , you old fool ! You 've got another guess , then . You ca n't get my nanny ! But I do think you might tell me what 's been going on . Even a guilty man has his curiosity . Did you get the money I left for you ? " Pete 's jaw sagged ; his eye expressed foggy bewilderment . " Money ? What money ? I thought they got it all when they arrested you ? " " Oh , do n't be a gloomy ass ! The money I left with Old Man Taylor ; the money you got down here for preliminary expenses on the mine . " " Mine ? " echoed Pete blankly . " What mine ? " " Old stuff ! " Stanley laughed aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't faze me . When you get good and ready to ring off , let me know . " " Well , then , " said Pete , " I will . Here we go , fresh . And you may not be just the best-pleased with my plan at first , son . I 'm not going to bail you out . " " What the hell ! " said Stan . " Why not ? " " I 've thought it all out , " said Pete , " and I 've talked it over with the sheriff . He 's agreed . You have to meet the action of the Grand Jury , anyhow ; you could n't leave the county ; and you 're better off in jail while I go back to New York to rustle money . " " Oh -- you 're going , are you ? " " To-night . You could n't leave the county even if you were out on bond . The sheriff 's a square man ; he 'll treat you right ; you 'll have a chance to get shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in Pima County for you . I want a letter to that cousin of yours in Abingdon . " " ' Tis n't Abingdon -- it 's Vesper . And I 'm not particularly anxious to tell him that I 'm in jail on a felony charge . " " Do n't want you to tell him -- or anybody . I suppose you 've told your girl already ? Yes ? Thought so . Well , do n't you tell any one else . You tell Cousin Oscar I 'm your pardner , and all right ; and that you 've got a mine , and you 'll guarantee the expenses for him and an expert in case they 're not satisfied upon investigation . I 'll do the rest . And do n't you let anybody bail you out of jail . You stay here . " " If I had n't seen you perform a miracle or two before now , I 'd see you damned first ! " said Stan . " But I suppose you know what you 're about . It 's more than I do . Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself bored here . " " I will . Let me outline two of the many possibilities : If I do n't bail you out , I 'm doin ' you dirt , ai n't I ? Well , then , if Zurich &; Gang think I 'm double-crossin ' you they 'll make me a proposition to throw in with them and throw you down on the copper mine . That 's my best chance to find out how to keep you from goin ' to the pen , is n't it ? And if you do n't tell Vesper that you 're in jail -- but Vesper finds it out , anyhow -- that gives me a chance to see who it is that lives in Vesper and keeps in touch with Cobre . And I 'll tell you something else : When I come back I 'll bail you out of jail and we 'll start from here . " " For the mine , you mean ? " " Sure ! Start right from the jail door at midnight and ride west . Zurich &; Company wo n't be expecting that -- seein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this-a-way . " " But my cousin will never be able to stand that ride . It 's a hundred and sixty miles -- more too . " " Your cousin can join us later -- or whoever ever comes along with development money . There 'll be about four or five of us -- picked men . I 'm goin ' this afternoon to see an old friend -- Joe Benavides -- and have him make all arrangements and be all ready to start whenever we get back , without any delay . I wo n't take the sheriff , because we might have negotiations to transact that would be highly indecorous in a sheriff . But he 's to share my share , because he put up a lot more money for the mine to-day .

" Got it all worked out . You do as I tell you and you 'll wear diamonds on your stripes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " CHAPTER VIII The hills send down a buttress to the north ; against it the Susquehanna flows swift and straight for a little space , vainly chafing . Just where the high ridge breaks sharp and steep to the river 's edge there is a grassy level , lulled by the sound of pleasant waters ; there sleep the dead of Abingdon . Here is a fair and noble prospect , which in Italy or in California had been world-famed ; a beauty generous and gracious -- valley , upland and hill and curving river . The hills are checkered to squares , cleared fields and green-black woods ; inevitably the mind goes out to those who wrought here when the forest was unbroken , and so comes back to read on the headstones the names of the quiet dead : Hill , Barton , Clark , Green , Camp , Hunt , Catlin , Giles , Sherwood , Tracy , Jewett , Lane , Gibson , Holmes , Yates , Hopkins , Goodenow , Griswold , Steele . Something stirs at your hair-roots -- these are the names of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lear -- and a lonely French Mercereau ; the rest are unmixed English . Not unnaturally you look next for an Episcopalian Church , finding none in Abingdon ; Abingdon is given over to fiery Dissenters -- the Old-World word comes unbidden into your mouth . But you were not so far wrong ; in prosperous Vesper , to westward , every one who pretends to be any one attends services at Saint Adalbert 's , a church noted for its gracious and satisfying architecture . In Vesper the name of Henry VIII is revered and his example followed . But the inquiring mind , seeking among the living bearers of these old names , suffers check and disillusion . There are no traditions . Their title deeds trace back to Coxe 's Manor , Nichols Patent , the Barton Tract , the Flint Purchase , Boston Ten Townships ; but in-dwellers of the land know nothing of who or why was Coxe , or where stood his Manor House ; have no memory of the Bostonians . In Vesper there are genealogists who might tell you such things ; old records that might prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible cause , with others of the ruling caste who may have some knowledge of these matters . Such grants were not uncommon in the Duke of York , his Province . In that good duke 's day , and later , following the pleasant fashion set by that Pope who divided his world equally between Spain and Portugal , valleys and mountains were tossed to supple courtiers by men named Charles , James , William , or George , kings by the grace of God ; the goodly land , the common wealth and birth-right of the unborn , was granted in princedom parcels to king 's favorites , king 's minions , to favorites of king 's minions , for services often enough unspecified . The toilers of Abingdon -- of other Abingdons , perhaps -- know none of these things . Winter has pushed them hard , summer been all too brief ; life has been crowded with a feverish instancy of work . There is a vague memory of the Sullivan Expedition ; once a year the early settlers , as a community enterprise , had brought salt from Syracuse ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest is silence . Perhaps this good old English stock , familiar for a thousand years with oppression and gentility , wonted to immemorial fraud , schooled by generations of cheerful teachers to speak no evil of dignities , to see everything for the best in the best of possible worlds , found no injustice in the granting of these broad manors -- or , at least , no novelty worthy of mention to their sons . There is no whisper of ancient wrong ; no hint or rankling of any irrevocable injustice . Doubtless some of these land grants were made , at a later day , to soldiers of the Revolution . But the children of the Revolution maintain a not unbecoming unreticence as to all things Revolutionary ; from their silence in this regard , as from the name of Manor , we may make safe inference . Doubtless many of the royalist estates were confiscated at that time . Doubtless , again , our Government , to encourage settlement , sold land in such large parcels in early days . Incurious Abingdon cares for none of these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so singular among citizens ? So unseeing a people ? Consider that , within the memory of men living , the wisdom of America has made free gift to the railroads , to encourage their building , of so much land as goes to the making of New England , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois ; a notable encouragement ! History does not remark upon this little transaction , however . In some piecemeal fashion , a sentence here , a phrase elsewhere , with scores or hundreds of pages intervening , History does , indeed , make yawning allusion to some such trivial circumstance ; refraining from comment in the most well-bred manner imaginable . It is only the ill-affected , the malcontents , who dwell upon such details . Is this not , indeed , a most beautiful world , and ours the land of opportunity , progress , education ? Let our faces , then , be ever glad and shining . Let us tune ourselves with the Infinite ; let a golden thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouches , no scolding -- no , no ! No ingratitude for all the bounties of Providence . Let us , then , be up and doing.  - -  Doing , certainly ; but why not think a little too ? Why is thinking in such disfavor ? Why is thinking , about subjects and things , the one crime never forgiven by respectability ? We have given away our resources , what should have been our common wealth ; we have squandered our land , wasted our forests . " Such trifles are not my business , " interrupts History , rather feverish of manner ; " my duty to record and magnify the affairs of the great . "  - -  Allow me , madam ; we have given away our coal , the wealth of the past ; our oil , the wealth of to-day ; except we do presently think to some purpose , we shall give away our stored electricity , the wealth of the future -- our water power which should , which must , remain ours and our children 's . " Socialist ! " shrieks History . The youth of Abingdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thermopylae , Consul Duilius , or the Licinian Laws ; the more advanced are even as far down as Elizabeth . For the rich and unmatched history of their own land , they have but a shallow patter of that ; no guess at its high meaning , no hint of a possible destiny apart from glory and greed and war , a future and opportunity " too high for hate , too great for rivalry . " The history of America is the story of the pioneer and the story of the immigrant . The students are taught nothing of the one or the other -- except for the case of certain immigrant pioneers , enskied and sainted , who never left the hearing of the sea ; a sturdy and stout-hearted folk enough , but something press-agented . Outside of school the student hears no mention of living immigrant or pioneer save in terms of gibe and sneer and taunt . The color and high romance of his own township is a thing undreamed of , as vague and shapeless as the foundations of Enoch , the city of Cain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time on earth a man made here a home ; though valor blazed the path ; though he laid the foundation of that house in hope and in love set up the gates of it , none knows the name of that man or of his bolder mate . There are no traditions -- and no ballads . A seven-mile stretch of the river follows the outlines of a sickle , or , if you are not familiar with sickles , of a handmade figure five . Abingdon lies at the sickle point , prosperous Vesper at the end of the handle ; Vesper , the county seat , abode of lawyers and doctors -- some bankers , too . Home also of retired business men , of retired farmers ; home of old families , hereditary county officials , legislators . Overarched with maples , the old road parallels the river bend , a mile away . The broad and fertile bottom land within the loop of this figure five is divided into three great farms --  " gentlemen 's estates . " The gentlemen are absentees all . A most desirable neighborhood ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolhouse and the cemetery . Malvern and Brookfield were owned respectively by two generals , gallant soldiers of the Civil War , successful lawyers , since , of New York City . Stately , high-columned Colonial houses , far back from the road ; the clustered tenant houses , the vast barns , long red tobacco sheds -- all are eloquent of a time when lumber was the cheapest factor of living . The one description serves for the two farms . These men had been boys together , their careers the same ; they had married sisters . But the red tobacco sheds of Malvern were only three hundred feet long -- this general had left a leg at Malvern Hill -- while the Brookfield sheds stretched full five hundred feet . At Brookfield , too , were the great racing-stables , of fabulous acreage ; disused now and falling to decay . One hundred and sixty thoroughbreds had sheltered here of old , with an army of grooms and trainers . There had been a race-track -- an oval mile at first , a kite-shaped mile in later days . Year by year now sees the stables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong-built paddocks remain to witness the greatness of days departed . Nearest to Vesper , on the smallest of the three farms , stood the largest of the three houses -- The Meadows ; better known as the Mitchell House . McClintock , a foreigner from Philadelphia , married a Mitchell in ' 67 . A good family , highly connected , the Mitchells ; brilliant , free-handed , great travelers ; something wildish , the younger men -- boys will be boys . In a silent , undemonstrative manner of his own McClintock gathered the loose money in and about Vesper ; a shrewd bargainer , ungiven to merrymakings ; one who knew how to keep dollars at work . It is worthy of note that no after hint of ill dealing attached to these years . In his own bleak way the man dealt justly ; not without a prudent liberality as well . For debtors deserving , industrious , and honest , he observed a careful and exact kindness , passing by his dues cheerfully , to take them at a more convenient season . Where death had been , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further sums for a tiding-over , after careful consideration of needs and opportunities , coupled with a reasonable expectation of repayment ; cheerfully taking any security at hand , taking the security of character as cheerfully when he felt himself justified ; in good time exacting his dues to the last penny -- still cheerfully . Not heartless , either ; in cases of extreme distress -- more than once or twice -- McClintock had both written off the obligation and added to it something for the day 's need , in a grim but not unkindly fashion ; always under seal of secrecy . No extortioner , this ; a dry , passionless , pertinacious man . McClintock bought the Mitchell House in the seventies -- boys still continuing to be boyish -- and there , a decade later , his wife died , childless . McClintock disposed of his takings unobserved , holding Mitchell House only , and slipped away to New York or elsewhere . The rents of Mitchell House were absorbed by a shadowy , almost mythical agent , whose name you always forgot until you hunted up the spidery signature on the receipts given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance connected with Mitchell House , McClintock had been quite forgotten of Vesper and Abingdon . The great house was much in demand as a summer residence ; those old oak-walled rooms were spacious and comfortable , if not artistic ; the house was admirably kept up . It was in the most desirable neighborhood ; there was fishing and boating ; the situation was " sightly . " We borrow the last word from the hill folk , the presentee landlords ; the producers , or , to put it quite bluntly , the workers . As the years slipped by , it crept into common knowledge that not every one could obtain a lease of Mitchell House . Applicants , Vesperian or " foreigners , " were kept waiting ; almost as if the invisible agent were examining into their eligibility . And it began to be observed that leaseholders were invariably light , frivolous , pleasure-loving people , such as kept the big house crowded with youth and folly , to company youth of its own . Such lessees were like to make agriculture a mockery ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a proverb , and an astonishment : a circumstance so singularly at variance with remembered thrift of the reputed owner as to keep green that owner 's name . Nor was that all . As youth became mature and wise , in the sad heartrending fashion youth has , or flitted to new hearths , in that other heartbreaking way of youth , it was noted that leases were not to be renewed on any terms ; and the new tenants , in turn , were ever such light and unthrift folk as the old , always with tall sons and gay daughters -- as if the mythical agent or his ghostly principal had set apart that old house to mirth and joy and laughter , to youth and love . It was remembered then , on certain struggling hill farms , that old McClintock had been childless ; and certain hill babies were cuddled the closer for that . Then , thirty years later , or forty -- some such matter -- McClintock slipped back to Vesper unheralded -- very many times a millionaire ; incidentally a hopeless invalid , sentenced for life to a wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomplaining , unapproachable , and grim , he kept to his rooms in the Iroquois , oldest of Vesper 's highly modern hotels ; or was wheeled abroad by his one attendant , who was valet , confidant , factotum , and friend -- Cornelius Van Lear , withered , parchment-faced , and brown , strikingly like Rameses II as to appearance and garrulity . It was to Van Lear that Vesper owed the known history of those forty years of McClintock 's . Closely questioned , the trusted confidant had once yielded to cajolery . " We 've been away , " said Van Lear . It was remarked that the inexplicable Mitchell House policy remained in force in the years since McClintock 's return ; witness the present incumbent , frivolous Thompson , foreigner from Buffalo -- him and his house parties ! It was Mitchell House still , mauger the McClintock millions and a half-century of possession . Whether this clinging to the old name was tribute to the free-handed Mitchells or evidence of fine old English firmness is a matter not yet determined . The free-handed Mitchells themselves , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married or died , lost their money , gone to work , or otherwise disappeared . Vesper kept knowledge of but two of them : Lawyer Oscar , solid , steady , highly respectable , already in the way of becoming Squire Mitchell , and like to better the Mitchell tradition of prosperity -- a warm man , a getting-on man , not to mention that he was the older nephew and probable heir to the McClintock millions ; and Oscar 's cousin , Stanley , youngest nephew of the millions , who , three years ago , had defied McClintock to his face . Stan Mitchell had always been wild , even as a boy , they said ; they remembered now . It seemed that McClintock had commanded young Stan to break his engagement to that Selden girl -- the schoolma'am at Brookfield , my dear -- one of the hill people . There had been a terrible scene . Earl Dawson was staying at the Iroquois and his door happened to be open a little . " Then you 'll get none of my money ! " said the old gentleman . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed the door . He was always a dreadful boy , my dear ! So violent and headstrong ! Always picking on my poor Johnny at school ; Johnny came home once with the most dreadful bruise over his eye -- Stanley 's work . So young Stan flung away to the West three years ago . The Selden girl still teaches the Brookfield District ; Stan Mitchell writes to her , the mail carrier says . No-o ; not so bad-looking , exactly -- in that common sort of way ! CHAPTER IX " Far be it from me to -- to --  " " Cavil or carp ? " " Exactly . Thank you . Beautiful line ! Quite Kipling . Far from me to cavil or carp , Tum-tee-tum-tee-didy , Or shift the shuttle from web or warp . And all for my dark-eyed lydy ! Far be it from me , as above . Nevertheless --  " " Why , then , the exertion ? " " Duty . Friendship . Francis Charles Boland , you 're lazy . " " Ferdie , " said Francis Charles , " you are right . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of being lazy ? " " Not at all . The calm repose ; that sort of thing -- what ? " Mr. Boland 's face assumed the patient expression of one misjudged . " Laziness ! " repeated Ferdie sternly . " ' T is a vice that I abhor . Slip me a smoke . " Francis Charles fumbled in the cypress humidor at Ferdie 's elbow ; he leaned over the table and gently closed Ferdie 's finger and thumb upon a cigarette . " Match , " sighed Ferdie . Boland struck a match ; he held the flame to the cigarette 's end . Ferdie puffed . Then he eyed his friend with judicial severity . " Abominably lazy ! Every opportunity -- family , education -- brains , perhaps . Why do n't you go to work ? " " My few and simple wants --  " Boland waved his hand airily . " Besides , who am I that I should crowd to the wall some worthy and industrious person ?  - -  practically taking the bread from the chappie 's mouth , you might say . No , no ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my faults , but --  " " Why do n't you go in for politics ? " " Ferdinand , little as you may deem it , there are limits . " " You have no ambition whatever ? " " By that sin fell the angels -- and look at them now ! " " Why not take a whirl at law ? " Boland sat up stiffly . " Mr. Sedgwick , " he observed with exceeding bitterness , " you go too far . Take back your ring ! Henceforth we meet as str-r-r-rangers ! " " Ever think of writing ? You do enough reading , Heaven knows . " Mr. Boland relapsed to a sagging sprawl ; he adjusted his finger tips to touch with delicate nicety . " Modesty , " he said with mincing primness , " is the brightest jewel in my crown . Litter and literature are not identical , really , though the superficial observer might be misled to think so . And yet , in a higher sense , perhaps , it may almost be said , with careful limitations , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , and making meticulous allowance for the personal equation --  " " Grisly ass ! Well , then , what 's the matter with the army ? " " My prudence is such , " responded Mr. Boland dreamily --  " in fact , my prudence is so very such , indeed -- one may almost say so extremely such -- not to mention the pertinent and trenchant question so well formulated by the little Peterkin --  " " Why do n't you marry ? " " Ha ! " said Francis Charles . " Whachamean -- 'Ha ' ? " " I mean what the poet meant when he spoke so feelingly of the "  - -   - -   - -  eager boys Who might have tasted girl 's love and been stung . " " Did n't say it . Who ? " " Did , too ! William Vaughn Moody . So I say ' Ha ! ' in the deepest and fullest meaning of the word ; and I will so defend it with my life . " " If you were good and married once , you might not be such a fool , " said Sedgwick hopefully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest and held himself oratorically erect --  " and my firm nerves shall never tremble ! I have tracked the tufted pocolunas to his lair ; I have slain the eight-legged galliwampus ; I have bearded the wallipaloova in his noisome den , and gazed into the glaring eyeballs of the fierce Numidian liar ; and I 'll try everything once -- except this . But I have known too many too-charming girls too well . To love them , " said Francis Charles sadly , " was a business education . " He lit a cigar , clasped his hands behind his head , tilted his chair precariously , and turned a blissful gaze to the little rift of sky beyond the crowding maples . Mr. Boland was neither tall nor short ; neither broad nor slender ; neither old nor young . He wore a thick mop of brown hair , tinged with chestnut in the sun . His forehead was broad and high and white and shapely . His eyes were deep-set and wide apart , very innocent , very large , and very brown , fringed with long lashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased . Ensued a nose bold and broad , freckled and inclined to puggishness ; a wide and generous mouth , quirky as to the corners of it ; high cheek bones ; and a square , freckled jaw -- all these ill-assorted features poised on a strong and muscular neck . Sedgwick , himself small and dark and wiry , regarded Mr. Boland with a scorning and deprecatory -- but with private approval . " You 're getting on , you know . You 're thirty -- past . I warn you . " " Ha ! " said Francis Charles again . Sedgwick raised his voice appealingly . " Hi , Thompson ! Here a minute ! Should n't Francis Charles marry ? " " Ab-so-lute-ly ! " boomed a voice within . The two young men , it should be said , sat on the broad porch of Mitchell House . The booming voice came from the library . " Must n't Francis Charles go to work ? " In the library a chair overturned with a crash . A startled silence ; then the sound of swift feet . Thompson came through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long shrewd face and a frosted poll . Feigned anxiety sat on his brow ; he planted his feet firmly and wide apart , and twinkled down at his young guests . " Pardon me , Mr. Sedgwick -- I fear I did not catch your words correctly . You were saying --  ? " Francis Charles brought his chair to level and spoke with great feeling : " As our host , to whom our bright young lives have been entrusted for a time -- standing to us , as you do , almost as a locoed parent -- I put it to you --  " " Shut up ! " roared Ferdie . " Thompson , you see this -- this object ? You hear it ? Must n't it go to work ? " " Ab-so-lutissimusly ! " " I protest against this outrage , " said Francis Charles . " Thompson , you 're beastly sober . I appeal to your better self . I am a philosopher . Sitting under your hospitable rooftree , I render you a greater service by my calm and dispassionate insight than I could possibly do by any ill-judged activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or desire , I see things in their true proportion . A dreamy spectator of the world 's turmoil , I do not enter into the hectic hurly-burly of life ; I merely withhold my approval from cant , shams , prejudice , formulae , hypocrisy , and lies . Such is the priceless service of the philosopher . " " Philosopher , my foot ! " jeered Ferdie . " You 're a brow ! A solemn and sanctimonious brow is bad enough , but a sprightly and godless brow is positive-itutely the limit ! " " That 's absurd , you know , " objected Francis Charles . " No man is really irreligious . Whether we make broad the phylactery or merely our minds , we are all alike at heart . The first waking thought is invariably , What of the day ? It is a prayer -- unconscious , unspoken , and sincere . We are all sun worshipers ; and when we meet we invoke the sky -- a good day to you ; a good night to you . It is a highly significant fact that all conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important fact in any one day , and , therefore , the most important fact in the sum of our days . We recognize this truth in our greetings ; we propitiate the dim and nameless gods of storm and sky ; we reverence their might , their paths above our knowing . Nor is this all . A fine day ; a bad day -- with the careless phrases we assent to such tremendous and inevitable implications : the helplessness of humanity , the brotherhood of man , equality , democracy . For what king or kaiser , against the implacable wind --  " Ferdie rose and pawed at his ears with both hands . " For the love of the merciful angels ! Can the drivel and cut the drool ! " " Those are very good words , Sedgwick , " said Mr. Thompson approvingly . " The word I had on my tongue was -- balderdash . But your thought was happier . Balderdash is a vague and shapeless term . It conjures up no definite vision . But drivel and drool -- very excellent words . " Mr. Thompson took a cigar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did you come here for , anyhow ? " demanded Ferdie explosively . " Do you play tennis ? Do you squire the girls ? Do you take a hand at bridge ? Do you fish ? Row ? Swim ? Motor ? Golf ? Booze ? Not you ! Might as well have stayed in New York . Two weeks now you have perched oh a porch -- perched and sat , and nothing more . Dawdle and dream and foozle over your musty old books . Yah ! Highbrow ! " " Little do you wot ; but I do more -- ah , far more !  - -  than perching on this porch . " " What do you do ? Mope and mowl ? If so , mowl for us . I never saw anybody mowl . Or does one hear people when they mowl ? " " Naturally it would n't occur to you -- but I think . About things . Mesopotamia . The spring-time of the world . Ur of the Chaldees . Melchisedec . Arabia Felix . The Simple Life ; and Why Men Leave Home . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our young friend is right , you know . You are not practical . You are booky . You are a dreamer . Get into the game . Get busy ! Get into business . Get a wad . Get ! Found an estate . Be somebody ! " " As for me , I go for a stroll . You give little Frankie a pain in his feelings ! For a crooked tuppence I 'd get somebody to wire me to come to New York at once.  - -  Uttering these intrepid words the brave youth rose gracefully and , without a glance at his detractors , sauntered nonchalantly to the gate.  - -  Unless , of course , you meant it for my good ? " He bent his brows inquiringly . " We meant it --  " said Ferdie , and paused . " for your good , " said Thompson . " Oh , well , if you meant it for my good ! " said Boland graciously . " All the same , if I ever decide to ' be somebody , ' I 'm going to be Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of some celebrated poseur -- I 'll tell you those ! Speaking as a man of liberal -- or lax -- morality , you surprise me . You are godly and cleanly men ; yet , when you saw in me a gem of purest ray serene , did you appeal to my better nature ? Nary ! In a wild and topsy-turvy world , did you implore me to devote my splendid and unwasted energies in the service of Good , with a capital G ? Nix ! You appealed to ambition , egotism , and greed .... Fie ! A fie upon each of you ! " " Do n't do that ! Have mercy ! We appeal to your better nature . We repent . " " All the same , I am going for my stroll , rejoined the youth , striving to repress his righteous indignation out of consideration for his humiliated companions , who now -- alas , too late !  - -  saw their conduct in its true light . For , he continued , with a flashing look from his intelligent eyes , I desire no pedestal ; I am not avaricious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . " * * * * * An hour later Francis Charles paused in his strolling , cap in hand , and turned back with Mary Selden . " How fortunate ! " he said . " Is n't it ? " said Miss Selden . " Odd , too , considering that I take this road home every evening after school is out . And when we reflect that you chanced this way last Thursday at half-past four -- and again on Friday -- it amounts to a coincidence . " " Direction of the subconscious mind , " explained Francis Charles , unabashed . " Profound meditation -- thirst for knowledge . What more natural than that my heedless foot should stray , instinctively as it were , toward the -- the --  " "  - -  old oaken schoolhouse that stood in a swamp . It is a shame , of the burning variety , that a State as wealthy as New York does n't and wo n't provide country schools with playgrounds big enough for anything but tiddledy-winks ! " declared Miss Selden . Her fine firm lip curled . Then she turned her clear gray eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . " " Do n't mention it ! People always have to interrupt me when they want to say anything . And now may I put a question or two ? **31;4286;TOOLONG sort of thing ? " The eyes further considered Mr. Boland . " You are not very complimentary to Mr. Thompson 's house party , I think , " said Mary in a cool , little , matter-of-fact voice . Altogether a cool-headed and practical young lady , this midget schoolma'am , with her uncompromising directness of speech and her clear eyes -- a merry , mirthful , frank , dainty , altogether delightful small person . Francis Charles stole an appreciative glance at the trim and jaunty figure beside him and answered evasively : " It was like this , you know : Was reading Mark Twain 's ' Life on the Mississippi . ' On the first page he observes of that river that it draws its water supply from twenty-eight States , all the way from Delaware to Idaho . I do n't just see it . Delaware , you know -- that 's pretty steep ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect Mr. Clemens of levity , " said Mary . " Could it have been a slip ? " " No slip . It 's repeated . At the end of the second chapter he says this -- I think I have it nearly word for word : ' At the meeting of the waters from Delaware and from Itasca , and from the mountain ranges close upon the Pacific --  ' Now what did he mean by making this very extraordinary statement twice ? Is there a catch about it ? Canals , or something ? " " I think , perhaps , " said Mary , " he meant to poke fun at our habit of reading without attention and of accepting statement as proof . " " That 's it , likely . But maybe there 's a joker about canals . Was n't there a Baltimore and Ohio Canal ? But again , if so , how did water from Delaware get to Baltimore ? Anyhow , that 's how it all began -- studying about canals . For , how about this dry canal along here ? It runs forty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driving Thompson 's car . It must have cost a nice bunch of money . Who built it ? When did who build it ? What did it cost ? Where did it begin ? Where did it start to ? Was it ever finished ? Was it ever used ? What was the name of it ? Nobody seems to know . " " I ca n't answer one of those questions , Mr. Boland . " " And you a schoolmistress ! Come now ! I 'll give you one more chance . What are the principal exports of Abingdon ? " " That 's easy . Let me see : potatoes , milk , eggs , butter , cheese . And hay , lumber , lath and bark -- chickens and -- and apples , apple cider -- rye , buckwheat , buckwheat flour , maple sirup ; pork and veal and beef ; and -- and that 's all , I guess . " " Wrong ! I 'll mark you fifty per cent . You 've omitted the most important item . Abingdon -- and every country town , I suppose -- ships off her young people -- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . That is why Abingdon is the saddest place I 've ever seen . Every farmhouse holds a tragedy . The young folk --  " They are all gone away ; The house is shut and still . There is nothing more to say . " Mary Selden stopped ; she looked up at her companion thoughtfully . Seashell colors ebbed from her face and left it almost pale . " Thank you for reminding me , " she said . " There is another bit of information I think you should have . You 'll probably think me bold , forward , and the rest of it ; I ca n't help that ; you need the knowledge . " Francis Charles groaned . " For my good , of course . Funny how anything that 's good for us is always disagreeable . Well , let 's have it ! " " It may not be of the slightest consequence to you , " began Mary , slightly confused . " And perhaps you know all about it -- any old gossip could tell you . It 's a wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . " Boland made a wry face . " I see ! Exports ? " Mary nodded , and her brave eyes drooped a little . " Abingdon 's finest export -- in my opinion , at least -- went to Arizona . And -- and he 's in trouble , Mr. Boland ; else I might not have told you this . But it seemed so horrid of me -- when he 's in such dreadful trouble . So , now you know . " " Arizona ? " said Boland . " Why , there 's where -- Excuse me ; I did n't mean to pry . " " Yes , Stanley Mitchell . Only that you stick in your shell , like a turtle , you 'd have heard before now that we were engaged . Are engaged . And you must n't say a word . No one knows about the trouble -- not even his uncle . I 've trusted you , Mr. Boland . " " See here , Miss Selden -- I 'm really not a bad sort . If I can be of any use -- here am I. And I lived in the Southwest four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had ! So I would n't be absolutely helpless out there . And I 'm my own man -- foot-loose . So , if you can use me -- for this thing seems to be serious --  " " Serious ! " said Mary . " Serious ! I ca n't tell you now . I should n't have told you even this much . Go now , Mr. Boland . And if we -- if I see where I can use you -- that was your word -- I 'll use you . But you are to keep away from me unless I send for you . Suppose Stan heard now what some gossip or other might very well write to him -- that ' Mary Selden walked home every night with a fascinating Francis Charles Boland ' ? " " Tell him about me , yourself -- touching lightly on my fascinations , " advised Boland . " And tell him why you tell him . Plain speaking is always the best way . " " It is , " said Mary . " I 'll do that very thing this night . I think I like you , Mr. Boland . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touching her hand . He looked after her as she went . " Plucky little devil ! " he said . " Level and straight and square . Some girl ! " CHAPTER X Mr. Oscar Mitchell , attorney and counselor at law , sauntered down River Street , with the cheerful and optimistic poise of one who has lunched well . A well-set-up man , a well-groomed man , as-it-is-done ; plainly worshipful ; worthy the highest degree of that most irregular of adjectives , respectable ; comparative , smart ; superlative , correct . Mr. Mitchell was correct ; habited after the true Polonian precept ; invisible , every buckle , snap , clasp , strap , wheel , axle , wedge , pulley , lever , and every other mechanical device known to science , was in place and of the best . As to adornment , all in good taste -- scarfpin , an unpretentious pearl in platinum ; garnet links , severely plain and quiet ; an unobtrusive watch-chain ; one ring , a small emerald ; no earrings . Mr. Mitchell 's face was well shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves , the smooth clear skin , and the rosy glow that comes from health and virtue , or from good living and massage . Despite fifty years , or near it , the flax-smooth hair held no glint of gray ; his eyes , blue and big and wide , were sharp and bright , calm , confident , almost candid -- not quite the last , because of a roving trick of clandestine observation ; his mouth , where it might or should have curved -- must once have curved in boyhood -- was set and guarded , even in skillful smilings , by a long censorship of undesirable facts , material or otherwise to any possible issue . Mr. Mitchell 's whole bearing was confident and assured ; his step , for all those fifty afore-said years , was light and elastic , even in sauntering ; he took the office stairs with the inimitable sprightly gallop of the town-bred . Man is a quadruped who has learned to use his front legs for other things than walking . Some hold that he has learned to use his head . But there are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not compass : to see , to think , to judge , and to act -- to see the obvious ; to think upon the thing seen ; to judge between our own resultant and conflicting thoughts , with no furtive finger of desire to tip the balance ; and to act upon that judgment without flinching . We fear the final and irretrievable calamity : we fear to make ourselves conspicuous , we conform to standard , we bear ourselves meekly in that station whereunto it hath pleased Heaven to call us ; the herd instinct survives four-footedness . For , we note the strange but not the familiar ; our thinking is to right reason what peat is to coal ; the outcry of the living and the dead perverts judgment , closes the ear to proof ; and our wisest fear the scorn of fools . So we walk cramped and strangely under the tragic tyranny of reiteration : whatever is right ; whatever is repeated often enough is true ; and logic is a device for evading the self-evident . Moreover , Carthage should be destroyed . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of prosperous Mr. Mitchell with the stiffened joints of other men who had climbed those hard stairs on occasion with shambling step , bent backs and sagging shoulders ; with faces lined and interlined ; with eyes dulled and dim , and sunken cheeks ; with hands misshapen , knotted and bent by toil : if image indeed of God , strangely distorted -- or a strange God . Consider now , in a world yielding enough and to spare for all , the endless succession of wise men , from the Contributing Editor of Proverbs unto this day , who have hymned the praise of diligence and docility , the scorn of sloth . Yet not one sage of the bountiful bunch has ever ventured to denounce the twin vices of industry and obedience . True , there is the story of blind Samson at the mill ; perhaps a parable . Underfed and overworked for generations , starved from birth , starved before birth , we drive and harry and crush them , the weakling and his weaker sons ; we exploit them , gull them , poison them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into our money mills ; we deny them youth , we deny them rest , we deny them opportunity , we deny them hope , or any hope of hope ; and we provide for age -- the poorhouse . So that charity is become of all words the most feared , most hated , most loathed and loathsome ; worse than crime or shame or death . We have left them from the work of their hands enough , scantly enough , to keep breath within their stunted bodies . " All the traffic can bear ! "  - -  a brazen rule . Of such sage policy the result can be seen in the wizened and undersized submerged of London ; of nearer than London . Man , by not taking thought , has taken a cubit from his stature . Meantime we prate comfortable blasphemies , scientific or other ; natural selection or the inscrutable decrees of God . Whereas this was manifestly a Hobson 's selection , most unnatural and forced , to choose want of all that makes life sweet and dear ; to choose gaunt babes , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iniquitous decrees are most scrutable , are surely of man 's devising and not of God 's . Or we invent a fire-new science , known as Eugenics , to treat the disease by new naming of symptoms : and prattle of the well born , when we mean well fed ; or the degenerate , when we might more truly say the disinherited . It is even held by certain poltroons that families have been started gutterward , of late centuries , when a father has been gloriously slain in the wars of the useless great . That such a circumstance , however glorious , may have been rather disadvantageous than otherwise to children thereby sent out into the world at six or sixteen years , lucky to become ditch-diggers or tip-takers . That some proportion of them do become beggars , thieves , paupers , sharpers , other things quite unfit for the ear of the young person -- a disconcerting consideration ; such ears can not be too carefully guarded . That , though the occupations named are entirely normal to all well-ordered states , descendants of persons in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant of it -- something handicapped by that haphazard bullet of a lifetime since , fired to advance the glorious cause of -- foreign commerce , or the like . * * * * * Mr. Mitchell occupied five rooms lined with law books and musty with the smell of leather . These rooms ranged end to end , each with a door that opened upon a dark hallway ; a waiting-room in front , the private office at the rear , to which no client was ever admitted directly . Depressed by delay , subdued by an overflow of thick volumes , when he reaches a suitable dejection he is tip-toed through dismal antechambers of wisdom , appalled by tall bookstacks , ushered into the leather-chaired office , and there further crushed by long shelves of dingy tin boxes , each box crowded with weighty secrets and shelved papers of fabulous moment and urgency ; the least paper of the smallest box more important -- the unfortunate client is clear on that point -- than any contemptible need of his own . Cowed and chastened , he is now ready to pay a fee suitable to the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or meekly to accept as justice any absurdity or monstrosity of the law . Mr. Mitchell was greeted by a slim , swarthy , black-eyed , elderly person of twenty-five or thirty , with a crooked nose and a crooked mind , half clerk and half familiar spirit -- Mr . Joseph Pelman , to wit ; who appeared perpetually on the point of choking himself by suppressed chucklings at his principal 's cleverness and the simplicity of dupes . " Well , Joe ? " " Two to see you , sir , " said Joe , his face lit up with sprightly malice . " On the same lay . That Watkins farm of yours . I got it out of ' em . Ho ho ! I kept ' em in different rooms . I hunted up their records in your record books . Doomsday Books , I call ' em . Ho ho ! " Mr. Mitchell selected a cigar , lit it , puffed it , and fixed his eye on his demon clerk . " Now then , " he said sharply , " let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume upon the desk and worried it open at a marker . It had been meant for a ledger , that huge volume ; the gray cloth covers bore the legend " N to Z. " Ledger it was , of a grim sort , with sinister entries of forgotten sins , the itemized strength or weakness of a thousand men . The confidential clerk ran a long , confidential finger along the spidery copperplate index of the W 's : " Wakelin , Walcott , Walker , Wallace , Walsh , Walters ; Earl , John , Peter , Ray , Rex , Roy -- Samuel -- page 1124 . " His nimble hands flew at the pages like a dog at a woodchuck hole . " Here't is -- 'Walters , Samuel : born ' 69 , son of John Walters , Holland Hill ; **30;4319;TOOLONG habits , none ; two years Vesper Academy ; three years Dennison shoe factories ; married 1896 -- one child , b. 1899 . Bought Travis Farm 1898 , paying half down ; paid balance out in five years ; dairy , fifteen cows ; forehanded , thrifty . Humph ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to one side and eyed his employer , fingering a wisp of black silk on his upper lip . " And the other ? " The second volume was spread open upon the desk . Clerk Pelman flung himself upon it with savage fury . " Bowen , Chauncey , son William Bowen , born 1872 -- um -- um -- married Louise Hill 92 -- um -- divorced ' 96 ; married Laura Wing ' 96 -- see Lottie Hall . Ran hotel at Larren ' 95 to ' 97 ; sheriff 's sale ' 97 ; worked Bowen Farm ' 97 to 1912 ; bought Eagle Hotel , Vesper , after death of William Bowen , 1900 . Traded Eagle Hotel for Griffin Farm , 1912 ; sold Griffin Farm , 1914 ; clerk Simon 's hardware store , Emmonsville , Pennsylvania . Heavy drinker , though seldom actually drunk ; suspected of some share in the Powers affair , or some knowledge , at least ; poker fiend . Bank note protested and paid by endorser 1897 , and again in 1902 ; has since repaid endorsers . See Larren Hotel , Eagle Hotel . " " Show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impish clerk cocked his head on one side again and gulped down a chuckle at his own wit . " Bowen , fool ! Jennie Page , his mother 's sister , died last week and left him a legacy -- twelve hundred dollars . I 'll have that out of him , or most of it , as a first payment . " The clerk turned , his mouth twisted awry to a malicious grin . " Trust you ! " he chuckled admiringly , and laid a confidential finger beside his crooked nose . " Ho ho ! This is the third time you 've sold the Watkins Farm ; and it wo n't be the last ! Oh , you 're a rare one , you are ! Four farms you 've got , and the way you got ' em ho ! You go Old Benjamin one better , you do . " Who so by the plow would thrive Himself must neither hold nor drive . " A regular hard driver , you are ! " " Some fine day , " answered Mitchell composedly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you be hanged ! " " No fear ! " rejoined the devil clerk , amiably . " I 'm too useful . I do your dirty work for you and leave you always with clean hands to show . Who stirs up damage suits ? Joe . Who digs up the willing witness ? J. Pelman . Who finds skeletons in respectable closets ? Joey . Who is the go-between ? Joseph . I 'm trusty too , because I dare not be otherwise . And because I like the work . I like to see you skin ' em , I do . Fools ! And because you give me a fair share of the plunder . Princely , I call it -- and wise . You be advised , Lawyer Mitchell , and always give me my fair share . Hang Joey ? Oh , no ! Never do ! No fear ! " A spasm of chuckles cut him short . " Go on , fool , and bring Bowen in . Then tell Walters the farm is already sold . " The door closed behind the useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling fashion . " No ; nor that , either , " said Joseph . He closed the door softly and leaned against it , cocking his head on one side with an evil smile . His employer glanced at him with uninquiring eyes . " You wo n't ask what , hey ? No ? But I 'll tell you what you were thinking of : Dropping me off the bridge . Upsetting the boat . The like of that . Ca n't have it . I ca n't afford it . You 're too liberal . Why , I would n't crawl under your car to repair it -- or go hunting with you -- not if it was ever so ! " " I really believe , " said Mr. Mitchell with surprised eyebrows , " that you are keeping me waiting ! " " That is why I never throw out hints about a future partnership , " continued the confidential man , undaunted . " You are such a liberal paymaster . Lord love you , sir , I do n't want any partnership ! This suits me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , and I get my fair share . Then , if I should ever get caught , you are unsmirched ; you can keep on making money . And you 'll keep on giving me my share . Oh , yes ; you will ! You 've such a good heart , Mr. Oscar ! I know you . You would n't want old Joey hanged ! Not you ! Oh , no ! " CHAPTER XI A stranger came to Abingdon by the morning train . Because of a wide-brimmed gray hat , which he wore pushed well back , to testify against burning suns elsewhere -- where such hats must be pulled well down , of necessity -- a few Abingdonians , in passing , gave the foreigner the tribute of a backward glance . A few only ; Abingdon has scant time for curiosity . Abingdon works hard for a living , like Saturday 's child , three hundred and sixty-five days a year ; except every fourth year . Aside from the hat , the foreigner might have been , for apparel , a thrifty farmer on a trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a soft white shirt with a soft collar , and a black tie , shot with red . But an observer would have seen that this was no care-lined farmer face ; that , though the man himself was small , his feet were disproportionately and absurdly small ; that his toes pointed forward as he walked ; and detraction might have called him bow-legged . This was Mr. Peter Johnson . Mr. Johnson took breakfast at the Abingdon Arms . He expressed to the landlord of that hostelry a civil surprise and gratification at the volume of Abingdon 's business , evinced by a steadily swelling current of early morning wagons , laden with produce , on their way to the station , or , by the river road , to the factory towns near by ; was assured that he should come in the potato-hauling season if he thought that was busy ; parried a few polite questions ; and asked the way to the Selden Farm . He stayed at the Selden Farm that day and that night . Afternoon of the next day found him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Chauncey Bowen , then engaged in Lawyer Mitchell 's office on the purchase of the Watkins Farm ; and he was presently ushered into the presence of Mr. Mitchell by the demon clerk . Mr. Mitchell greeted him affably . " Good-day , sir . What can I do for you to-day ? " " Mr. Oscar Mitchell , is it ? " " The same , and happy to serve you . " " Got a letter for you from your cousin , Stan . My name 's Johnson . " Mitchell extended his hand , gave Pete a grip of warm welcome . " I am delighted to see you , Mr. Johnson . Take a chair -- this big one is the most comfortable . And how is Stanley ? A good boy ; I am very fond of him . But , to be honest about it , he is a wretched correspondent . I have not heard from him since Christmas , and then barely a line -- the compliments of the season . What is he doing with himself ? Does he prosper ? And why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making money is concerned , he stands to make more than he 'll ever need , as you 'll see when you read his letter , " said Pete . " Otherwise he 's only just tol'able . Fact is , he 's confined to his room . That 's why I come to do this business for him . " " Stanley sick ? Dear , dear ! What is it ? Nothing serious , I hope ! " " Why , no-o -- not to say sick , exactly . He just ca n't seem to get out o ' doors very handy . He 's sorter on a diet , you might say . " " Too bad ; too bad ! He should have written his friends about it . None of us knew a word of it . I 'll write to him to-night and give him a good scolding . " " Aw , do n't ye do that ! " said Pete , twisting his hat in embarrassment . " I do n't want he should know I told you . He's -- he 's kind of sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody . " " It 's not his lungs , I hope ? " " Naw ! No thin ' like that . I reckon what 's ailin ' him is mostly stayin ' too long in one place . Nothin ' serious . Do n't ye worry one mite about him . Change of scene is what he needs more than anything else -- and horseback ridin ' . I 'll yank him out of that soon as I get back . And now suppose you read his letter . It 's mighty important to us . I forgot to tell you me and , Stan , is pardners . And I 'm free to say I 'm anxious to see how you take to his proposition . " " If you will excuse me , then ? " Mitchell seated himself , opened the letter , and ran over it . It was brief . Refolding it , the lawyer laid it on the table before him , tapped it , and considered Mr. Johnson with regarding eyes . When he spoke his voice was more friendly than ever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rich mine . " " Mr. Mitchell , " said Pete , leaning forward in his eagerness , " I reckon that mine of ours is just about the richest strike ever found in Arizona ! Of course it ai n't rightly a mine -- it 's only where a mine is goin ' to be . Just a claim . There 's nothin ' done to it yet . But it 's sure goin ' to be a crackajack . There 's a whole solid mountain of high-grade copper . " " Stanley says he wants me to finance it . He offers to refund all expenses if the mine -- if the claim "  - -  Mitchell smiled cordially as he made the correction --  " does not prove all he represents . " " Well , that ought to make you safe . Stan 's got a right smart of property out there . I do n't know how he 's fixed back here . Mr. Mitchell , if you do n't look into this , you 'll be missin ' the chance of your life . " " But if the claim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't understand . This copper is in the roughest part of an awful rough mountain -- right on top , " said Pete , most untruthfully . " That 's why nobody ai n't ever found it before -- because it is so rough . It 'll cost a heap of money just to build a wagon road up to it -- as much as five or six thousand dollars , maybe . Stan and me ca n't handle it alone . We got to take some one in , and we gave you the first show . And I wish , " said Pete nervously , " that you could see your way to come in with us and go right back with me , at once . We 're scared somebody else might find it and make a heap of trouble . There 's some mighty mean men out there . " " Have a cigar ? " said the lawyer , opening a desk drawer . He held a match for his visitor and observed , with satisfaction , that Pete 's hand shook . Plainly here was a simple-minded person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell smoked for a little while in thoughtful silence . Then , with his best straightforward look , he turned and faced Pete across the table . " I will be plain with you , Mr. Johnson . This is a most unusual adventure for me . I am a man who rather prides himself that he makes no investments that are not conservative . But Stan is my cousin , and he has always been the soul of honor . His word is good with me . I may even make bold to say that you , yourself , have impressed me favorably . In short , you may consider me committed to a thorough investigation of your claim . After that , we shall see . " " You 'll never regret it , " said Pete . " Shake ! " " I suppose you are not commissioned to make any definite proposal as to terms , in case the investigation terminates as favorably as you anticipate ? At any rate , this is an early day to speak of final adjustments . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to settle that with Stan . Probably you 'll want to sign contracts and things . I do n't know nothin ' about law . But there 's plenty for all . I 'm sure of one thing -- you 'll be glad to throw in with us on ' most any terms once you see that copper , and have a lot of assays made and get your expert 's report on it . " " I hope so , I am sure . Stanley seems very confident . But I fear I shall have to disappoint you in one particular : I can hardly leave my business here at loose ends and go back with you at once , as , I gather , is your desire . " Pete 's face fell . " How long will it take you ? " " Let me consider . I shall have to arrange for other lawyers to appear for me in cases now pending , which will imply lengthy consultations and crowded days . It will be very inconvenient and may not have the happiest results . But I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will stretch a point in your favor , hoping it may be remembered when we come to discuss final terms with each other . Shall we say a week ? " He tapped his knuckles with the folded letter and added carelessly : " And , of course , I shall have to pack , and all that . You must advise me as to suitable clothing for roughing it . How far is your mine from the railroad ? " " Oh , not far . About forty mile . Yes , I guess I can wait a week . I stand the hotel grub pretty well . " " Where are you staying , Mr. Johnson ? " " The Algonquin . Pretty nifty . " " Good house . And how many days is it by rail to -- Bless my soul , Mr. Johnson -- here am I , upsetting my staid life , deserting my business on what may very well prove , after all , but a wild-goose chase ! And I do not know to what place in Arizona we are bound , even as a starting-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! And I do n't suppose there 's a map of Arizona in town . " " Oh , I 'll make you a map , " said Pete . " Cobre -- that 's Mexican for copper -- is where we 'll make our headquarters . You give me some paper and I 'll make you a map mighty quick . " Pete made a sketchy but fairly accurate map of Southern Arizona , with the main lines of railroad and the branches . " Here 's Silverbell , at the end of this little spur of railroad . Now give me that other sheet of paper and I 'll show you where the mine is , and the country round Cobre . " Wetting his pencil , working with slow and painstaking effort , making slight erasures and corrections with loving care , poor , trustful , unsuspecting Pete mapped out , with true creative joy , a district that never was on land or sea , accompanying each stroke of his handiwork with verbal comments , explaining each original mountain chain or newly invented valley with a wealth of descriptive detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart to see how readily the simple-minded mountaineer became his dupe and tool , and watched , with a covert sneer , as Pete joyously contrived his own downfall and undoing . " I have many questions to ask about your mine -- I believe I had almost said our mine . " The lawyer smiled cordially . " To begin with , how about water and fuel ? " " Lots of it . A cedar brake , checker-boarded all along the mountain . There 's where it gets the name , Ajedrez Mountain -- Chess Mountain ; kind of laid out in squares that way . Good enough for mine timbers , too . Big spring -- big enough so you might almost call it a creek -- right close by . It 's almost too good to be true -- could n't be handier if I 'd dreamed it ! But , " he added with regretful conscientiousness , " the water 's pretty hard , I 'm sorry to say . Most generally is , around copper that way . And it 'll have to be pumped uphill to the mine . Too bad the spring could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been piped down . " Prompted by more questions he plunged into a glowing description of Ajedrez Mountain ; the marvelous scope of country to be seen from the summit ; the beauty of its steep and precipitous canons ; the Indian pottery ; the mysterious deposit of oyster shells , high on the mountain-side , proving conclusively that Ajedrez Mountain had risen from the depths of some prehistoric sea ; ending with a vivid description of the obstacles to be surmounted by each of the alternate projects for the wagon road up to the mine , with estimates of comparative cost . At length it drew on to the hour for Mitchell 's dinner and Pete 's supper , and they parted with many expressions of elation and good-will . From his window in the Algonquin , Pete Johnson watched Mitchell picking his way across to the Iroquois House , and smiled grimly . " There , " he confided to his pipe --  " there goes a man hotfoot to dig his own grave with his own tongue ! The Selden kid has done told Uncle McClintock about Stan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written to Cousin Oscar about no jail , and that I was n't to tell him either . Now goes Cousin Oscar on a beeline to tell Uncle how dreadful Stanley has went and disgraced the family ; and Uncle will want to know how he heard of it . ' Why , ' says Oscar , ' an old ignoramus from Arizona , named Johnson -- friend of Stanley's -- he told me about it . He came up here to get me to help Stanley out ; wanted me to go out and be his lawyer ! ' " And , right there , down goes Cousin Oscar 's meat-house ! He 'll never touch a penny of Uncle 's money . Selden , she says Uncle Mac was all for blowing him up sky-high ; but she made him promise not to , so as not to queer my game . If I get Oscar Mitchell out to the desert , I 'll almost persuade him to be a Christian .... She 's got Old McClintock on the run , Mary Selden has ! " Shucks ! The minute I heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . I wonder what makes Stan such a fool ! He might ' a ' knowed ! ... This Oscar person is pretty soft .... Mighty nice kid , little Selden is ! Smart too . She 's some schemer ! ... Too smart for Oscar ! ... Different complected , and all that ; but her ways -- she sort of puts me in mind of Miss Sally . " CHAPTER XII Mr. Oscar Mitchell was a bachelor , though not precisely lorn . He maintained an elm-shaded residence on Front Street , presided over by an ancient housekeeper , of certain and gusty disposition , who had guided his first toddling steps and grieved with him for childhood 's insupportable wrongs , and whose vinegarish disapprovals were still feared by Mitchell ; it was for her praise or blame that his overt walk and conversation were austere and godly , his less laudable activities so mole-like . After dinner Mr. Mitchell slipped into a smoking jacket with a violent velvet lining and sat in his den -- a den bedecorated after the manner known to the muddle-minded as artistic , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To this den came now the sprightly clerk , summoned by telephone . " Sit down , Pelman . I sent for you because I desire your opinion and cooperation upon a matter of the first importance , " said the lawyer , using his most gracious manner . Mr. Joseph Pelman , pricking up his ears at the smooth conciliation of eye and voice , warily circled the room , holding Mitchell 's eyes as he went , selected a corner chair for obvious strategic reasons , pushed it against the wall , tapped that wall apprehensively with a backward-reaching hand , seated himself stiffly upon the extreme edge of the chair , and faced his principal , bolt upright and bristling with deliberate insolence . " If it is murder I want a third , " he remarked . The lawyer gloomed upon this frowardness . " That is a poor way to greet an opportunity to make your fortune once and for all , " he said . " I have something on hand now , which , if we can swing it --  " " One-third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visible effort . He swallowed hard and began again : " If we can carry out my plan successfully -- and it seems to be safe , and certain , and almost free from risk -- there will be no necessity hereafter for any of us to engage in any crooked dealings whatever . Indeed , to take up cleanly ways would be the part of wisdom . Or , young as you are , you will be able to retire , if you prefer , sure of every gratification that money can buy . " " Necessity does n't make me a crook . I 'm crooked by nature . I like crookedness , " said Pelman . " That 's why I 'm with you . " " Now , Joey , do n't talk --  " " Do n't you ' Joey ' me ! " exploded the demon clerk . " It was ' fool ' this afternoon . I 'm Pelman when there 's any nerve needed for your schemes ; but when you smile at me and call me Joey , what I say is -- one-third ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Try it ! I 'll stab your black heart with a corkscrew ! I 've studied it all out , and I 've carried a corkscrew on purpose ever since I 've known you . Thirty-three and one-third per cent . Three-ninths . Proceed ! " Mitchell paced the floor for a few furious seconds before he began again . " You remember Mayer Zurich , whom we helped through that fake bankruptcy at Syracuse ? " " Three-ninths ? " " Yes , damn you ! " Joey settled back in his chair , crossed his knees comfortably , screwed his face to round-eyed innocence , and gave a dainty caress to the thin silky line of black on his upper lip . " You may go on , Oscar , " he drawled patronizingly . After another angry turn , Mitchell resumed with forced composure : " Zurich is now a fixture in Cobre , Arizona , where my Cousin Stanley lives . I had a letter from him a week ago and he tells me -- this is in strict confidence , mind you -- that poor Stanley is in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deprecatory hand . " Save your breath , Oscar dear , and pass on to the main proposition . Now that we are partners , in manner of speaking , since your generous concession of a few minutes past -- about the thirds -- I must be very considerate of you . " As if to mark the new dignity , the junior partner dropped the crude and boisterous phrases that had hitherto marked his converse . Mitchell recognized the subtle significance of this change by an angry gesture . " Since our interests are now one , " continued the new member suavely , " propriety seems to demand that I should tell you the Mitchell-Zurich affair has no secrets from me . If young Stanley is in prison , it is because you put him there ! " " What ! " " Yes , " said Joey with a complacent stroke at his upper lip . " I have duplicate keys to all your dispatch boxes and filing cabinets . " " You fiend ! " " I wished to protect you against any temptation toward ingratitude , " explained Joey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much entertained by your correspondence . There was much chaff -- that was to be expected . But there was also some precious grain which I have garnered with care . For instance , I have copies of all Zurich 's letters to you . You have been endeavoring to ruin your cousin , fearing that McClintock might relent and remember Stanley in his will ; you have succeeded at last . Whatever new villainy you have to propose , it now should be easier to name it , since you are relieved from the necessity of beating round the bush.  - -  You were saying --  ? " " Stanley has found a mine , a copper deposit of fabulous richness ; so he writes , and so Zurich assures me . Zurich has had a sample of it assayed ; he does not know where the deposit is located , but hopes to find it before Stanley or Stanley 's partner can get secure possession . Zurich wants me to put up cash to finance the search and the early development . " " Well ? Where do I come in ? I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am eating husks . " " You listen . Singularly enough , Stanley has sent his partner up here to make me exactly the same proposition . " " That was Stan 's partner to-day -- that old gray goat ? " " Exactly . So , you see , I have two chances . " " I need not ask you , " said Joey with a sage nod , " whether you intend to throw in your lot with the thieves or with the honest men . You will flock with the thieves . " " I will , " said Mitchell grimly . " My cousin had quite supplanted me with my so-called Uncle McClintock . The old dotard would have left him every cent , except for that calf-love affair of Stan 's with the Selden girl . Some reflections on the girl 's character had come to McClintock 's ears . " " Mitchell , " said Joey , " before God , you make me sick ! " " What 's the matter with you now , fool ? " demanded Mitchell . " I never so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . " " Trust you ! " said the clerk . " You 're a slimy toad , you are . You 're nauseatin ' . Pah ! Ptth ! " " McClintock repeated these rumors to Stan , " said the lawyer gloatingly . " Stan called him a liar . My uncle never liked me . It is very doubtful if he leaves me more than a moderate bequest , even now . But I have at least made sure that he leaves nothing to Stan . And now I shall strip his mine from him and leave him to rot in the penitentiary . For I always hated him , quite aside from any thought of my uncle 's estate . I hate him for what he is . I always wanted to trample his girl-face in the mire . " " Leave your chicken-curses and come to the point , " urged the junior member of the firm impatiently . " It is no news to me that your brain is diseased and your heart rotten . What is it you want me to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in some way to meddle with this mine . If I but had your head for my very own along with the sand in my craw , I 'd tell you to go to hell . Having only brains enough to know what I am , I 'm cursed by having to depend upon you . Name your corpse ! Come through ! " " You shut your foul mouth and listen . You throw me off . " " Give me a cigar , then . Thanks . I await your pleasure . " " Zurich warned me that Stanley 's partner , this old man Johnson , had gone East and would in all probability come here to bring proposals from Stan . He came yesterday , bearing a letter of introduction from Stan . The fear that I would not close with his proposition had the poor old gentleman on needles and pins . But I fell in with his offer . I won his confidence and within the hour he had turned himself wrong side out . He made me a map , which shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am to go to Arizona with him in a week -- poor idiot ! Instead , you are to get him into jail at once . " " How ? " " The simplest and most direct way possible . You have that Poole tribe under your thumb , have you not ? " " Bootlegging , chicken-stealing , sneak-thieving , arson , and perjury . And they are ripe for any deviltry , without compulsion . All I need to do is to show them a piece of money and give instructions . " " Get the two biggest ones , then -- Amos and Seth . Have them pick a fight with the man Johnson and swear him into jail . They need n't hurt him much and they need n't bother about provocation . All they need to do is to contrive to get him in some quiet spot , beat him up decently , and swear that Johnson started the row without warning ; that they never saw him before , and that they think he was drunk . Manage so that Johnson sees the inside of the jail by to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you and I will take the afternoon train for Arizona -- with my map . I have just returned from informing my beloved uncle of Stanley 's ignominious situation , and I told him I could go to the rescue at once , for the sake of the family honor . I thought the old fool would throw a fit , he was so enraged . So , good-bye to Nephew Stanley ! " " Look here , Mr. Oscar ; that 's no good , you know , " remonstrated Pelman . " What 's the good of throwing Johnson into jail for five or ten days -- or perhaps only a fine ? He may even have letters from Stan to some one else in Vesper , some one influential ; he may beat the case . He 'll be out there in no time , making you trouble . That old goat looks as if he might butt . " Mitchell smiled . " That 's only half my plan . The jailer is also one of your handy men . I 'll furnish you plenty of money for the Pooles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Contrive a faked rescue of Johnson . The jailer can be found trussed up and gagged , to-morrow about midnight . Best have only one of the Pooles in it ; take Amos . He shall wear a mask and be the bold rescuer ; he shall open the cell door , whisper ' Mitchell ' to Johnson , and help him escape . Once out , without taking off his mask , Amos can hide Johnson somewhere . I leave you to perfect these details . Then , after discarding his mask , Poole can give the alarm . It is immaterial whether he rouses the undersheriff or finds a policeman ; but he is to give information that he has just seen Johnson at liberty , skulking near such-and-such a place . Such information , from a man so recently the victim of a wanton assault at Johnson 's hands , will seem a natural act . " " Mr. Mitchell , you 're a wonder ! " declared Joey in a fine heat of admiration . As the lawyer unfolded his plan the partner-clerk , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworth ; with every sentence he deported himself less like Pelman the partner , shrank more and more to Joey the devil clerk . " The first part of your programme sounded like amateur stuff ; but the second number is a scream . Any mistreated guy would fall for that . I would , myself . He 'll be up against it for jail-breaking , conspiracy , assaulting an officer , using deadly weapons -- and the best is , he will actually be guilty and have no kick coming ! Look what a head that is of yours ! Even if he should escape rearrest here , it will be a case for extradition . If he goes back to Arizona , he will be nabbed ; our worthy sheriff will be furious at the insult to his authority and will make every effort to gather Mr. Johnson in . Either way you have Johnson off your shoulders . " " Stanley is off my shoulders , too , and good for a nice long term . And I have full directions for reaching Stanley 's mine . You and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our little way about ; we will be wholly dependent upon Zurich ; and , therefore , we must share our map with him . But , on the whole , I think I have managed rather well than otherwise . It may be , after this bonanza is safely in our hands , that we may be able to discover some ultimate wizardry of finance which shall deal with Zurich 's case . We shall see . " CHAPTER XIII Mr. Francis Charles Boland , propped up on one elbow , sprawled upon a rug spread upon the grass under a giant willow tree at Mitchell House , deep in the Chronicles of Sir John Froissart . Mr. Ferdinand Sedgwick tip-toed unheard across the velvet sward . He prodded Frances Charles with his toe . " Ouch ! " said Francis Charles . " You 'll catch your death of cold . Get up ! Your company is desired . " " Go ' way ! " " Miss Dexter wants you . " " Do n't , either . She was coiled in the hammock ten minutes ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slept ; I heard her snore . " " She 's awake now and wants you to make a fourth at bridge ; you two against Elsie and me . " " Botheration ! Tell her you could n't find me . " " I would hush the voice of conscience and do your bidding gladly , old thing , if it lay within the sphere of practical politics . But , unfortunately , she saw you . " " Tell her to go to the devil ! " Ferdie considered this proposition and rejected it with regret . " She would n't do it . But you go on with your reading . I 'll tell her you 're disgruntled . She 'll understand . This will make the fourth day that you have n't taken your accustomed stroll by the schoolhouse . We 're all interested , Frankie . " " You banshee ! " Francis withdrew the finger that had been keeping his place in the book . " I suppose I 'll have to go back with you . " He sat up , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned you down hard , old boy , " murmured Mr. Sedgwick sympathetically . " My own life has been very sad . It has been blighted forever , several times . Is she pretty ? I have n't seen her , myself , and the reports of the men-folks and the young ladies do n't tally . Funny thing , but scientific observation shows that when a girl says another girl is fine-looking -- Hully Gee ! And vice versa . Eh ? What say ? " " Did n't say anything . You probably overheard me thinking . If so , I beg your pardon . " " I saw a fine old Western gentleman drive by here with old man Selden yesterday -- looked like a Westerner , anyhow ; big sombrero , leather face , and all that . I hope , " said Ferdie anxiously , " that it was not this venerable gentleman who put you on the blink . He was a fine old relic ; but he looked rather patriarchal for the role of Lochinvar . Unless , of course , he has the money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I met them on the Vesper Bridge , " replied Boland absently , ignoring the banter . He got to his feet and spoke with dreamy animation . " Ferdie , that chap made me feel homesick with just one look at him . Best time I ever had was with that sort . Younger men I was running with , of course . Fine chaps ; splendidly educated and perfect gentlemen when sober -- I quote from an uncredited quotation from a copy of an imitation of a celebrated plagiarist . Would go back there and stay and stay , only for the lady mother . She 's used to the city .... By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept . " " Hi ! " said Ferdie . " Party yellin ' at you from the road . Come out of your trance . " Francis Charles looked up . A farmer had stopped his team by the front gate . " Mr. Boland ! " he trumpeted through his hands . Boland answered the hail and started for the gate , Ferdie following ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , and drove on . " Oh , la , la ! The thick plottens ! " observed Ferdie . Francis Charles tore open the letter , read it hastily , and turned with sparkling eyes to his friend . His friend , for his part , sighed profoundly . " Oh Francis , Francis ! " he chided . " Here , you howling idiot ; read it ! " said Francis . The idiot took the letter and read : DEAR MR . BOLAND : I need your help . Mr. Johnson , a friend of Stanley's -- his best friend -- is up here from Arizona upon business of the utmost importance , both to himself and Stanley . I have only this moment had word that Mr. Johnson is in the most serious trouble . To be plain , he is in Vesper Jail . There has been foul play , part and parcel of a conspiracy directed against Stanley . Please come at once . I claim your promise . Mary Selden Ferdie handed it back . " My friend 's friend is my friend ? And so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite ' em -- that sort of thing -- what ? Does that let me in ? I seem to qualify in a small-flealike way . " " You bet you do , old chap ! That 's the spirit ! Do you rush up and present my profound apologies to the ladies -- important business matter . I 'll be getting out the buzz wagon . You shall see Mary Selden . You shall also see how right well and featly our no-bel and intrepid young hero bore himself , just a-pitchin ' and a-rarin ' , when inclination jibed with jooty ! " Two minutes later they took the curve by the big gate on two wheels . As they straightened into the river road , Mr. Sedgwick spread one hand over his heart , rolled his eyes heavenward and observed with fine dramatic effect : " ' I claim your pr-r-r-r-omise ' ! " Mr. Johnson sat in a cell of Vesper Jail , charged with assault and battery in the nth degree ; drunk and disorderly understood , but that charge unpreferred as yet . It is no part of legal method to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the judicial mind may see for itself . By this capital arrangement , the justly intoxicated may be acquitted for lack of convincing evidence , after they have had time to sober up ; while the unjustly accused , who should go free on sight , are at the mercy of such evidence as the unjust accuser sees fit to bring or send . The Messrs . Poole had executed their commission upon Vesper Bridge , pouncing upon Mr. Johnson as he passed between them , all unsuspecting . They might well have failed in their errand , however , had it not been that Mr. Johnson was , in a manner of speaking , in dishabille , having left his gun at the hotel . Even so , he improvised several new lines and some effective stage business before he was overpowered by numbers and weight . The brothers Poole were regarded with much disfavor by Undersheriff Barton , who made the arrest ; but their appearance bore out their story . It was plain that some one had battered them . Mr. Johnson quite won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He accepted the situation with extreme composure , exhibiting small rancor toward his accusers , refraining from counter-comment to their heated descriptive analysis of himself ; he troubled himself to make no denials . " I 'll tell my yarn to the judge , " he said , and walked to jail with his captors in friendliest fashion . These circumstances , coupled with the deputy 's experienced dislike for the complaining witnesses and a well-grounded unofficial joy at their battered state , won favor for the prisoner . The second floor of the jail was crowded with a noisy and noisome crew . Johnson was taken to the third floor , untenanted save for himself , and ushered into a quiet and pleasant corner cell , whence he might solace himself by a view of the street and the courthouse park . Further , the deputy ministered to Mr. Johnson 's hurts with water and court-plaster , and a beefsteak applied to a bruised and swollen eye . He volunteered his good offices as a witness in the moot matter of intoxication and in all ways gave him treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . " You ca n't get a hearing until to-morrow ; the justice of the peace is out of town . Do you know anybody here ? Can you give bail ? " " Ya-as , I reckon so . But I wo n't worry about that till to-morrow . Night in jail do n't hurt any one . " " If I can do anything for you , do n't hesitate to ask . " " Thank you kindly , I 'll take you up on that . Just let me think up a little . " The upshot of his considerations was that the jailer carried to a tailor 's shop Johnson 's coat and vest , sadly mishandled during the brief affray on the bridge ; the deputy dispatched a messenger to the Selden Farm with a note for Miss Mary Selden , and also made diligent inquiry as to Mr. Oscar Mitchell , reporting that Mr. Mitchell had taken the westbound flyer at four o'clock , together with Mr. Pelman , his clerk ; both taking tickets to El Paso . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Algonquin , clean bedding , cigars , magazines , and a lamp -- the last item contrary to rule . He chatted with his prisoner during supper , cleared away the dishes , locked the cell door , with a cheerful wish for good night , and left Pete with his reflections . Pete had hardly got to sleep when he was wakened by a queer , clinking noise . He sat up in the bed and listened . The sound continued . It seemed to come from the window , from which the sash had been removed because of July heat . Pete went to investigate . He found , black and startling against the starlight beyond , a small rubber balloon , such as children love , bobbing up and down across the window ; tied to it was a delicate silk fishline , which furnished the motive power . As this was pulled in or paid out the balloon scraped by the window , and a pocket-size cigar clipper , tied beneath at the end of a six-inch string , tinkled and scratched on the iron bars . Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationary . " This , " said Pete , grinning hugely , " is the doings of that Selden kid . She is certainly one fine small person ! " Pete turned the lamp low and placed it on the floor at his feet , so that it should not unduly shape him against the window ; he pulled gently on the line . It gave ; a guarded whistle came softly from the dark shadow of the jail . Pete detached the captive balloon , with a blessing , and pulled in the fishline . Knotted to it was a stout cord , and in the knot was a small piece of paper , rolled cigarette fashion . Pete untied the knot ; he dropped his coil of fishline out of the window , first securing the stronger cord by a turn round his hand lest he should inadvertently drop that as well ; he held the paper to the light , and read the message : Waiting for you , with car , two blocks north . Destroy MS . Pete pulled up the cord , hand over hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminently suited for cutting bars ; he drew in the slack again and this time came to the end of the cord , to which was fastened a strong rope . He drew this up noiselessly and laid the coils on the floor . Then he penciled a note , in turn : Clear out . Will join you later . He tied this missive on his cord , together with the cigar clipper , and lowered them from the window . There was a signaling tug at the cord ; Pete dropped it . Pete dressed himself ; he placed a chair under the window ; then he extinguished the lamp , took the saw , and prepared to saw out the bars . But it was destined to be otherwise . Even as he raised the saw , he stiffened in his tracks , listening ; his blood tingled to his finger tips . He heard a footstep on the stair , faint , guarded , but unmistakable . It came on , slowly , stealthily . Pete thrust saw and rope under his mattress and flung himself upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , with one careless arm under his head , just as if he had dropped asleep unawares . A few seconds later came a little click , startling to tense nerves , at the cell door ; a slender shaft of light lanced the darkness , spreading to a mellow cone of radiance . It searched and probed ; it rested upon the silent figure on the bed . " Sh-h-h ! " said a sibilant whisper . Peter muttered , rolled over uneasily , opened his eyes and leaped up , springing aside from that golden circle of light in well-simulated alarm . " Hush-h ! " said the whisper . " I 'm going to let you out . Be quiet ! " Keys jingled softly in the dark ; the lock turned gently and the door opened . In that brief flash of time Pete Johnson noted that there had been no hesitation about which key to use . His thought flew to the kindly undersheriff . His hand swept swiftly over the table ; a match crackled . " Smoke ? " said Pete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " snarled the visitor , and struck out the match . But Pete had seen . The undersheriff was a man of medium stature ; this large masked person was about the size of the larger of his lately made acquaintances , the brothers Poole . " Come on ! " whispered the rescuer huskily . " Mitchell sent me . He 'll take you away in his car . " " Wait a minute ! We 'd just as well take these cigars , " answered Pete in the same slinking tone . " Here ; take a handful . How 'd you get in ? " " Held the jailer up with a gun . Got him tied and gagged . Shut up , will you ? You can talk when you get safe out of this . " He tip-toed away , Pete following . The quivering searchlight crept along the hall ; it picked out the stairs . Halfway down , Pete touched his guide on the shoulder . " Wait ! " Standing on the higher stair , he whispered in the larger man 's ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Give ' em to me . I 'll let all the prisoners go . If there 's an alarm , it 'll make our chances for a get-away just so much better . " The Samaritan hesitated . " Aw , I 'd like to , all right ! But I guess we 'd better not . " He started on ; the stair creaked horribly . In the hall below Pete overtook him and halted him again . " Aw , come on -- be a sport ! " he urged . " Just open this one cell , here , and give that lad the keys . He can do the rest while we beat it . If you was in there , would n't you want to get out ? " This appeal had its effect on the Samaritan . He unlocked the cell door , after a cautious trying of half a dozen keys . Apparently his scruples returned again ; he stood irresolute in the cell doorway , turning the searchlight on its yet unawakened occupant . Peter swooped down from behind . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the same time lunging forward with head and shoulders , with all the force of his small , seasoned body behind the effort . The Samaritan toppled over , sprawling on his face within the cell . With a heartfelt shriek the legal occupant leaped from his bunk and landed on the intruder 's shoulder blades . Peter slammed shut the door ; the spring lock clicked . The searchlight rolled , luminous , along the floor ; its glowworm light showed Poole 's unmasked and twisted face . Pete snatched the bunch of keys and raced up the stairs , bending low to avoid a possible bullet ; followed by disapproving words . At the stairhead , beyond the range of a bullet 's flight , Peter paused . Pandemonium reigned below . The roused prisoners shouted rage , alarm , or joy , and whistled shrilly through their fingers , wild with excitement ; and from the violated cell arose a prodigious crash of thudding fists , the smashing of a splintered chair , the sickening impact of locked bodies falling against the stone walls or upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rattling of iron doors , hoots , cheers and catcalls from the other cells . Authority made no sign . Peter crouched in the darkness above , smiling happily . From the duration of the conflict the combatants seemed to be equally matched . But the roar of battle grew presently feebler ; curiosity stilled the audience , at least in part ; it became evident , by language and the sound of tortured and whistling breath , that Poole was choking his opponent into submission and offering profuse apologies for his disturbance of privacy . Mingled with this explanation were derogatory opinions of some one , delivered with extraordinary bitterness . From the context it would seem that those remarks were meant to apply to Peter Johnson . Listening intently , Peter seemed to hear from the first floor a feeble drumming , as of one beating the floor with bound feet . Then the tumult broke out afresh . Peter went back to his cell and lit his lamp . Leaving the door wide open , he coiled the rope neatly and placed it upon his table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the light ; and so lay down to pleasant dreams . CHAPTER XIV Mr. Johnson was rudely wakened from his slumbers by a violent hand upon his shoulder . Opening his eyes , he smiled up into the scowling face of Undersheriff Barton . " Good-morning , sheriff , " he said , and sat up , yawning . The sun was shining brightly . Mr. Johnson reached for his trousers and yawned again . The scandalized sheriff was unable to reply . He had been summoned by passers-by , who , hearing the turbulent clamor for breakfast made by the neglected prisoners , had hastened to give the alarm . He had found the jailer tightly bound , almost choked by his gag , suffering so cruelly from cramps that he could not get up when released , and barely able to utter the word " Johnson . " Acting on that hint , Barton had rushed up-stairs , ignoring the shouts of his mutinous prisoners as he went through the second-floor corridor , to find on the third floor an opened cell , with a bunch of keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , Mr. Johnson 's neatly folded clothing on the chair , and Mr. Johnson peacefully asleep . The sheriff pointed to the rope and saw , and choked , spluttering inarticulate noises . Mr. Johnson suspended dressing operations and patted him on the back . " There , there ! " he crooned benevolently . " Take it easy . What 's the trouble ? I hate to see you all worked up like this , for you was sure mighty white to me yesterday . Nicest jail I ever was in . But there was a thundering racket downstairs last night . I ai n't complainin ' none -- I would n't be that ungrateful , after all you done for me . But I did n't get a good night 's rest . Wish you 'd put me in another cell to-night . There was folks droppin ' in here at all hours of the night , pesterin ' me . I did n't sleep good at all . " " Dropping in ? What in hell do you mean ? " gurgled the sheriff , still pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter ? Are n't you a little mite petulant this A.M. ? What have I done that you should be so short to me ? " " That 's what I want to know . What have you been doing here ? " " I ai n't been doing nothin ' , I tell you -- except stayin ' here , where I belong , " said Pete virtuously . His eye followed the sheriff 's pointing finger , and rested , without a qualm , on the evidence . The sheriff laid a trembling hand on the coiled rope . " How 'd you get this in , damn you ? " " That rope ? Oh , a fellow shoved it through the bars . Wanted me to saw my way out and go with him , I reckon . I did n't want to argue with him , so I just took it and did n't let on I was n't comin ' . Was n't that right ? Why , I thought you 'd be pleased ! I could n't have any way of knowin ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in through a third-story window ? " Pete 's ingenuous face took on an injured look . " I reckon maybe he stood on his tip-toes , " he admitted . " Who was it ? " " I do n't know , " said Pete truthfully . " He did n't speak and I did n't see him . Maybe he did n't want me to break jail ; but I thought , seein ' the saw and all , he had some such idea in mind . " " Did he bring the keys , too ? " " Oh , no -- that was another man entirely . He came a little later . And he sure wanted me to quit jail ; because he said so . But I would n't go , sheriff . I thought you would n't like it . Say , you ought to sit down , feller . You 're going to have apoplexy one of these days , sure as you 're a foot high ! " " You come downstairs with me , " said the angry Barton . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your heart out of you . " " All right , sheriff . Just you wait till I get dressed . " Peter laced his shoes , put on his hat , and laid tie , coat , and vest negligently across the hollow of his arm . " I ca n't do my tie good unless I got a looking-glass , " he explained , and paused to light a cigar . " Have one , sheriff , " he said with hospitable urgency . " Get out of here ! " shouted the enraged officer . Pete tripped light-footed down the stairs . At the stairfoot the sheriff paused . In the cell directly opposite were two bruised and tattered inmates where there should have been but one , and that one undismantled . The sheriff surveyed the wreckage within . His jaw dropped ; his face went red to the hair ; his lip trembled as he pointed to the larger of the two roommates , who was , beyond doubting , Amos Poole -- or some remainder of him . " How did that man get here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Him ? Oh , I throwed him in there ! " said Pete lightly . " That 's the man who brought me the keys and pestered me to go away with him . Say , sheriff , better watch out ! He told me he had a gun , and that he had the jailer tied and gagged . " " The damned skunk did n't have no gun ! All he had was a flashlight , and I broke that over his head . But he tole me the same story about the jailer -- all except the gun . " This testimony was volunteered by Poole 's cellmate . Peter removed his cigar and looked at the " damned skunk " more closely . " Why , if it ai n't Mr. Poole ! " he said . " Sure , it 's Poole . What in hell does he mean , then -- swearin ' you into jail and then breakin ' you out ? " " Had n't you better ask him ? " said Peter , very reasonably . " You come on down to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of this or have the heart out of some one . " He rolled a dancing eye at Poole with the word , and Poole shrank before it . " Breakfast ! Bring us our breakfast ! " bawled the prisoners . " Breakfast ! " The sheriff dealt leniently with the uproar , realizing that these were but weakling folk and , under the influence of excitement , hardly responsible . " Brooks has been tied up all night , and is all but dead . I 'll get you something as soon as I can , " he said , " on condition that you stop that hullabaloo at once . Johnson , come down to the office . " He telephoned a hurry call to a restaurant , Brooks , the jailer , being plainly incapable of furnishing breakfast . Then he turned to Pete . " What is this , Johnson ? A plant ? " Pete 's nose quivered . " Sure ! It was a plant from the first . The Pooles were hired to set upon me . This one was sent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I figure it , I was to be betrayed back again , to get two or three years in the pen for breaking jail . Nice little scheme ! " " Who did it ? For Poole , if you 're not lying , was only a tool . " " Sheriff , " said Pete , " pass your hand through my hair and feel there , and look at my face . See any scars ? Quite a lot of ' em ? And all in front ? Men like me do n't have to lie . They pay for what they break . You go back up there and get after Poole . He 'll tell you . Any man that will do what he did to me , for money , will squeal on his employer . Sure ! " Overhead the hammering and shouting broke out afresh . " There , " said the sheriff regretfully ; " now I 'll have to make those fellows go without anything to eat till dinner-time . " " Sheriff , " said Pete , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should do me one more favor . It will be the last one ; for I sha n't be with you long . Give those boys their breakfast . I got ' em into this . I 'll pay for it , and take it mighty kindly of you , besides . " " Oh , all right ! " growled the sheriff , secretly relieved . " One thing more , brother : I think your jailer was in this -- but that 's your business . Anyhow , Poole knew which key opened my door , and he did n't know the others . Of course , he may have forced your jailer to tell him that . But Poole did n't strike me as being up to any bold enterprise unless it was cut-and-dried . " The sheriff departed , leaving Johnson unguarded in the office . In ten minutes he was back . " All right , " he nodded . " He confessed -- whimpering hard . Brooks was in it . I 've got him locked up . Nice doings , this is ! " " Mitchell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . What was the reason ? " " There is never but one reason . Money.  - -  Who 's this ? " It was Mr. Boland , attended by Mr. Ferdie Sedgwick , both sadly disheveled and bearing marks of a sleepless night . Francis Charles spoke hurriedly to the sheriff . " Oh , I say , Barton ! McClintock will go bail for this man Johnson . Ferdie and I would , but we 're not taxpayers in the county . Come over to the Iroquois , wo n't you ? " " Boland , " said the sheriff solemnly , " take this scoundrel out of my jail ! Do n't you ever let him step foot in here again . There wo n't be any bail ; but he must appear before His Honor later to-day for the formal dismissal of the case . Take him away ! If you can possibly do so , ship him out of town at once . " Francis Charles winked at Peter as they went down the steps . " So it was you last night ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much for you sometime . " " Thank us both . This is my friend Sedgwick , who was to have been our chauffeur . " The two gentlemen bowed , grinning joyfully . " My name 's Boland , and I 'm to be your first stockholder . Miss Selden told me about you -- which is my certificate of character . Come over to the hotel and see Old McClintock . Miss Selden is there too . She bawled him out about Nephew Stan last night . Regular old-fashioned wigging ! And now she has the old gentleman eating from her hand . Say , how about this Stanley thing , anyway ? Any good ? " " Son , " said Pete , " Stanley is a regular person . " Boland 's face clouded . " Well , I 'm going out with you and have a good look at him , " he said gloomily . " If I 'm not satisfied with him , I 'll refuse my consent . And I 'll look at your mine -- if you 've got any mine . They used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hassayampa , he can never tell the truth again . And you 're from Arizona . " Pete stole a shrewd look at the young man 's face . " There is another old saying about the Hassayampa , son , " he said kindly , " with even more truth to it than in that old dicho . They say that whoever drinks of the waters of the Hassayampa must come to drink again . " He bent his brows at Francis Charles . " Good guess , " admitted Boland , answering the look . " I 've never been to Arizona , but I 've sampled the Pecos and the Rio Grande ; and I must go back ' Where the flyin ' - fishes play on the road to Mandalay , where the dawn comes up like thunder '  - -  Oh , gee ! That 's my real reason . I suppose that silly girl and your picturesque pardner will marry , anyhow , even if I disapprove -- precious pair they 'll make ! And if I take a squint at the copper proposition , it will be mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he ca n't tear himself away from little old N'Yawk . This is his first trip West -- here in Vesper . Myself , I 've got only two coppers to clink together -- or maybe three . We 're rather overlooking Ferdie , do n't you think ? Must n't do that . Might withdraw his backin ' . Ferdie , speak up pretty for the gennulmun ! " " Oh , do n't mind me , Mr. Johnson , " said Sedgwick cheerfully . " I 'm used to hearin ' Boland hog the conversation , and trottin ' to keep up with him . Glad to be seen on the street with him . Gives one a standing , you know . But , I say , old chappie , why did n't you come last night ? Deuced anxious , we were ! Thought you missed the way , or slid down your rope and got nabbed again , maybe . No end of a funk I was in , not being used to lawbreakin ' , except by advice of counsel . And we felt a certain delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about the big ructions at the jail . Come over to McClintock 's rooms -- ca n't you ?  - -  where we 'll be all together , and tell us about it -- so you wo n't have to tell it but the one time . " " No , sir , " said Pete decidedly . " I get my breakfast first , and a large shave . Got to do credit to Stan . Then I 'll go with you . Big mistake , though . Story like this gets better after bein ' told a few times . I could make quite a tale of this , with a little practice . " CHAPTER XV " You 've got Stan sized up all wrong , Mr. McClintock , " said Pete . " That boy did n't want your money . He never so much as mentioned your name to me . If he had , I would have known why Old Man Trouble was haunting him so persistent . And he do n't want anybody 's money . He 's got a-plenty of his own -- in prospect . And he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without what he has n't got . " " You say he has proved himself a good man of his hands ? " demanded McClintock sharply . " Yessir -- Stanley is sure one double-fisted citizen , " said Pete . " Here is what I heard spoken of him by highest authority the day before I left : ' He 'll make a hand ! ' That was the word said of Stan to me . We do n't get any higher than that in Arizona . When you say of a man , ' He 'll do to take along , ' you 've said it all . And Stanley Mitchell will do to take along . I 'm thinkin ' , sir , that you did him no such an ill turn when your quarrel sent him out there . He was maybe the least bit inclined to be butter-flighty when he first landed . " It was a queer gathering . McClintock sat in his great wheeled chair , leaning against the cushions ; he held a silken skull-cap in his hand , revealing a shining poll with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little red ferret eyes , fiery still , for all the burden of his years , looked piercingly out under shaggy brows . His attendant , withered and brown and gaunt , stood silent behind him . Mary Selden , quiet and pale , was at the old man 's left hand . Pete Johnson , with one puffed and discolored eye , a bruised cheek , and with skinned and bandaged knuckles , but cheerful and sunny of demeanor , sat facing McClintock . Boland and Sedgwick sat a little to one side . They had tried to withdraw , on the plea of intrusion ; but McClintock had overruled them and bade them stay . " For the few high words that passed atween us , I care not a boddle -- though , for the cause of them I take shame to myself , " said McClintock , glancing down affectionately at Mary Selden . " I was the more misled -- at the contrivance of yon fleechin ' scoundrel of an Oscar . ' I 'm off to Arizona , to win the boy free , ' says he -- the leein ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that my heart warmed to the lad at the very time of it -- that he had spunk to speak his mind . I have seen too much of the supple stock . Sirs , it is but an ill thing to be over-rich , in which estate mankind is seen at the worst . The fawning sort cringe underfoot for favors , and the true breed of kindly folk are all o'erapt to pass the rich man by , verra scornful-like . " He looked hard at Peter Johnson . " I am naming no names , " he added . " As for my gear , it would be a queer thing if I could not do what I like with my own . Even a gay young birkie like yoursel ' should understand that , Mr. Johnson . Besides , we talk of what is by . The lawyer has been ; Van Lear has given him instructions , and the pack of you shall witness my hand to the bit paper that does Stan right , or ever you leave this room . " Pete shrugged his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softied it up to you . And he 's a stiff-necked one -- Stan ! " McClintock laughed with a relish . " For all ye are sic a fine young man , Mr. Johnson , I 'm doubtin ' ye 're no deeplomat . And Stan will be knowin ' that same . Here is what ye shall do : you shall go to him and say that you saw an old man sitting by his leelane , handfast to the chimney neuk ; and that you are thinking I will be needin ' a friendly face , and that you think ill of him for that same stiff neck of his . Ye will be having him come to seek and not to gie ; folk aye like better to be forgiven than to forgive ; I do , mysel ' . That is what you shall do for me . " " And I did not come to coax money from you to develop the mine with , either , " said Pete . " If the play had n't come just this way , with the jail and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " I am thinkin ' that you are one who has had his own way of it overmuch , " said McClintock . His little red eyes shot sparks beneath the beetling brows ; he had long since discovered that he had the power to badger Mr. Johnson ; and divined that , as a usual thing , Johnson was a man not easily ruffled . The old man enjoyed the situation mightily and made the most of it . " When ye are come to your growth , you will be more patient of sma ' crossings . Here is no case for argle-bargle . You have taken yon twa brisk lads into composition with you "  - -  he nodded toward the brisk lads --  " the compact being that they were to provide fodder for yonder mine-beastie , so far as in them lies , and , when they should grow short of siller , to seek more for you . Weel , they need seek no farther , then . I have told them that I will be their backer at need ; I made the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . You are ill to please , young man ! You come here with a very singular story , and nowt to back it but a glib tongue and your smooth , innocent-like young face -- and you go back hame with a heaped gowpen of gold , and mair in the kist ahint of that . I think ye do very weel for yoursel ' . " " Do n't mind him , Mr. Johnson , " said Mary Selden . " He is only teasing you . " Old McClintock covered her hand with his own and continued : " Listen to her now ! Was ne'er a lassie yet could bear to think ill of a bonny face ! " He drew down his brows at Pete , who writhed visibly . Ferdie Sedgwick rose and presented a slip of pasteboard to McClintock , with a bow . " I have to-day heard with astonishment -- ahem !  - -  and with indignation , a great many unseemly and disrespectful remarks concerning money , and more particularly concerning money that runs to millions , " he said , opposing a grave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to present you my card , Mr. McClintock , and to assure you that I harbor no such sentiments . I can always be reached at the address given ; and I beg you to remember , sir , that I shall be most happy to serve you in the event that --  " A rising gale of laughter drowned his further remarks , but he continued in dumb show , with fervid gesticulations , and a mouth that moved rapidly but produced no sound , concluding with a humble bow ; and stalked back to his chair with stately dignity , unmarred by even the semblance of a smile . Young Peter Johnson howled with the rest , his sulks forgotten ; and even the withered serving-man relaxed to a smile -- a portent hitherto unknown . " Come ; we grow giddy , " chided McClintock at last , wiping his own eyes as he spoke . " We have done with talk of yonder ghost-bogle mine . But I must trouble you yet with a word of my own , which is partly to justify me before you . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flitting , I set it down in black and white that he was to halve my gear wi ' Oscar , share and share alike . I aye likit the boy weel . From this day all is changit ; Oscar shall hae neither plack nor bawbee of mine ; all goes to my wife 's nephew , Stanley Mitchell , as is set down in due form in the bit testament that is waiting without ; bating only some few sma ' bequests for old kindness . It is but loath I am to poison our mirth with the name of the man Oscar ; the deil will hae him to be brandered ; he is fast grippit , except he be cast out as an orra-piece , like the smith in the Norroway tale . When ye are come to your own land , Mr. Johnson , ye will find that brockle-faced stot there afore you ; and I trust ye will comb him weel . Heckle him finely , and spare not ; but ere ye have done wi ' him , for my sake drop a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When all 's said , the man is of my wife 's blood and bears her name ; I would not have that name publicly disgracit . They were a kindly folk , the Mitchells . I thought puirly of theem for a wastrel crew when I was young . But now I am old , I doubt their way was as near right as mine . You will tell him for me , Mr. Johnson , to name one who shall put a value on his gear , and I shall name another ; and what they agree upon I shall pay over to his doer , and then may I never hear of him more -- unless it be of ony glisk of good yet in him , the which I shall be most blithe to hear . And so let that be my last word of Oscar . Cornelius , bring in the lawyer body , and let us be ower wi ' it ; for I think it verra needfu ' that the two lads should even pack their mails and take train this day for the West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Boland ? And gie him a bit word of counsel from time to time , should ye see him temptit to whilly-whas and follies ? I fear me he is prone to insubordination . " " I 'll watch over him , sir , " laughed Boland . " I 'll keep him in order . And if Miss Selden should have a message -- or anything -- to send , perhaps --  " Miss Selden blushed and laughed . " No , thank you ! " she said . " I'll -- I 'll send it by Mr. Johnson . " The will was brought in . McClintock affixed his signature in a firm round hand ; the others signed as witnesses . " Man Johnson , will ye bide behind for a word ? " said McClintock as the farewells were said . When the others were gone , he made a sign to Van Lear , who left the room . " I 'm asking you to have Stanley back soon -- though he 'll be coming for the lassie 's sake , ony gate . But I am wearyin ' for a sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man . " And yoursel ' , Mr. Johnson ; if you visit to York State again , I should be blithe to have a crack with you . But it must be early days , for I 'll be flittin Man , I 'll tell ye a dead secret . Ye ken the auld man ahint my chair -- him that the silly folk ca ' Rameses Second in their sport ? What think ye the auld body whispert to me but now ? That he likit ye weel -- no less ! Man , that sets ye up ! Cornelius has not said so much for ony man these twenty year -- so my jest is true enough , for all ' t was said in fleerin ' ; ye bear your years well and the credentials of them in your face . Ye 'll not be minding for an old man 's daffin ' ? " " Sure not ! I 'm a great hand at the joke-play myself , " said Pete . " And it 's good for me to do the squirmin ' myself , for once . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll be thinkin ' of you , nights , and your wild life out beyont . I 'll tell you somethin ' now , and belike you 'll laugh at me . " He lowered his voice and spoke wistfully . " Man , I have ne'er fought wi ' my hands in a ' my life -- not since I was a wean ; nor yet felt the pinch of ony pressin ' danger to be facit , that I might know how jeopardy sorts wi ' my stomach . I became man-grown as a halflin ' boy , or e'er you were born yet -- a starvelin ' boy , workin ' for bare bread ; and hard beset I was for't . So my thoughts turned all money-wise , till it became fixture and habit with me ; and I took nae time for pleasures . But when I heard of your fight yestreen , and how you begawked him that we are to mention no more , and of your skirmishes and by-falls with these gentry of your own land , my silly auld blood leapit in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , I do think truly that once I might hae likit weel to hae been lot and part of siclike stir and hazard , and to see the bale-fires burn . " Bear with me a moment yet , and I 'll have done . There is a hard question I would spier of you . I thought but ill of my kind in my younger days . Now , being old , I see , with a thankful heart , how many verra fine people inhabit here . ' T is a rale bonny world . And , lookin ' back , I see too often where I have made harsh judgings of my fellows . There are more excuses for ill-doings to my old eyes . Was't so with you ? " " Yes , " said Pete . " We 're not such a poor lot after all -- not when we stop to think or when we 're forced to see . In fire or flood , or sickness , we 're all eager to bear a hand -- for we see , then . Our purses and our hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cases -- the telephone girls and the elevator boys . Do n't sound heroic much , do they ? But , by God , when the floods come , the telephone girls die at their desks , still sendin ' out warnings ! And when a big fire comes , and there are lives to save , them triflin ' cigarette-smoking , sassy , no-account boys run the elevators through hell and back as long as the cables hold ! Every time ! " The old man 's eye kindled . " Look ye there , now ! Man , and have ye noticed that too ? " he cried triumphantly . " Ye have e'en the secret of it . We 're good in emairgencies , the now ; when the time comes when we get a glimmer that all life is emairgency and tremblin ' peril , that every turn may be the wrong turn -- when we can see that our petty system of suns and all is nobbut a wee darkling cockle-boat , driftin' ' and tossed abune the waves in the outmost seas of an onrushing universe -- hap-chance we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll tak ' hands for comfort in the dark . ' T is good theology , yon wise saying of the silly street : ' We are all in the same boat . Do n't rock the boat ! ' " * * * * * When Peter had gone , McClintock 's feeble hands , on the wheel-rims , pushed his chair to the wall and took from a locked cabinet an old and faded daguerreotype of a woman with smiling eyes . He looked at it long and silently , and fell asleep there , the time-stained locket in his hands . When Van Lear returned , McClintock woke barely in time to hide the locket under a cunning hand -- and spoke harshly to that aged servitor . CHAPTER XVI Before the two adventurers left Vesper , Johnson wired to Jose Benavides the date of his arrival at Tucson ; and from El Paso he wired Jackson Carr to leave Mohawk the next day but one , with the last load of water . Johnson and Boland arrived in Tucson at seven-twenty-six in the morning . Benavides met them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a grizzled beard . " So this is Francis Charles ? " said Stanley . " Frank by brevet , now . Pete has promoted me . He says that Francis Charles is too heavy for the mild climate , and unwieldy in emergencies . " " You ought to see Frankie in his new khaki suit ! He 's just too sweet for anything , " said Pete . " You know Benavides , Stan ? " " Joe and I are lifelong friends of a week 's standing . Compadres -- eh , Joe ? He came to console my captivity on your account , at first , and found me so charming that he came back on his own . " " Ah , que hombre ! Do not beliefing heem , Don Hooaleece . He ees begging me efery day to come again back -- that leetle one , " cried Joe indignantly . " I come here not wis plessir -- not so . He is ver ' triste , thees boy -- ver ' dull . I am to take sorry for heem -- sin vergueenza ! Also , perhaps a leetle I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bes ' dinners , lak now . " " Such a care-free life ! " sighed Francis-Frank . " Decidedly I must reform my ways . One finds so much gayety and happiness among the criminal classes , as I observed when I first met Mr. Johnson -- in Vesper Jail . " " Oh , has Pete been in jail ? That 's good . Tell us about it , Pete . " That was a morning which flashed by quickly . The gleeful history of events in Vesper was told once and again , with Pete 's estimate and critical analysis of the Vesperian world . Stanley 's new fortunes were announced , and Pete spoke privately with him concerning McClintock . The coming campaign was planned in detail , over another imported meal . Stanley was to be released that afternoon , Benavides becoming security for him ; but , through the courtesy of the sheriff , he was to keep his cell until late bedtime . It was wished to make the start without courting observation . For the same reason , when the sheriff escorted Stanley and Benavides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pete did not go along . Instead , he took Frank-Francis for a sight-seeing stroll about the town . It was past two when , in an unquiet street , Boland 's eye fell upon a signboard which drew his eye : THE PALMILLA THE ONLY SECOND-CLASS SALOON IN THE CITY Boland called attention to this surprising proclamation . " Yes , " said Pete ; " that 's Rhiny Archer 's place . Little old Irishman -- sharp as a steel trap . You 'll like him . Let 's go in . " They marched in . The barroom was deserted ; Tucson was hardly awakened from siesta as yet . From the open door of a side room came a murmur of voices . " Where 's Rhiny ? " demanded Pete of the bartender . " Rhiny do n't own the place now . Sold out and gone . " " Shucks ! " said Pete . " That 's too bad . Where 'd he go ? " " Do n't know . You might ask the boss . " He raised his voice : " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the summons , Something Dewing appeared at the side door ; he gave a little start when he saw Pete at the bar . " Why , hello , Johnson ! Well met ! This is a surprise . " " Same here , " said Pete . " Did n't know you were in town . " " Yes ; I bought Rhiny out . Tired of Cobre . Want to take a hand at poker , Pete ? Here 's two lumberjacks down from up-country , and honing to play . Their money 's burning holes in their pockets . I was just telling them that it 's too early to start a game yet . " He indicated the other two men , who were indeed disguised as lumberjacks , even to their hands ; but their faces were not the faces of workingmen . " Cappers , " thought Pete . Aloud he said : " Not to-day , I guess . Where 's Rhiny ? In town yet ? " " No ; he left . Do n't know where he went exactly -- somewhere up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you if you want to write to him . " " Oh , no -- nothing particular . Just wanted a chin with him . " " Better try the cards a whirl , Pete , " urged the gambler . " I do n't want to start up for a three-handed game . " Pete considered . It was not good taste to give a second invitation ; evidently Dewing had strong reasons for desiring his company . " If this tinhorn thinks he can pump me , I 'll let him try it a while , " he reflected . He glanced at his watch . " Three o'clock . I 'll tell you what I 'll do with you , Dewing , " he said : " I 'll disport round till supper-time , if I last that long . But I ca n't go very strong . Quit you at supper-time , win or lose . Say six o'clock , sharp . The table will be filled up long before that . " " Come into the anteroom . We 'll start in with ten-cent chips , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join us ? " " Not at first . Later , maybe . Come on , Frankie ! " Boland followed into the side room . He was a little disappointed in Pete . " You see , it 's like this , " said Pete , sinking into a chair after the door was closed : " Back where Boland lives the rules are different . They play a game something like Old Maid , and call it poker . He can sit behind me a spell and I 'll explain how we play it . Then , if he wants to , he can sit in with us . Deal ' em up . " " Cut for deal -- high deals , " said Dewing . After the first hand was played , Pete began his explanations : " We play all jack pots here , Frankie ; and we use five aces . That is in the Constitution of the State of Texas , and the Texas influence reaches clear to the Colorado River . The joker goes for aces , flushes , and straights . It always counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you 've got a four-card straight and the joker , then the joker fills your hand . Here ; I 'll show you . " Between deals he sorted out a ten , nine , eight , and seven , and the joker with them . " There , " he said ; " with a hand like this you can call the joker either a jack or a six , just as you please . It is usual to call it a jack . But in anything except straights and straight flushes -- if there is any such thing as a straight flush -- the cuter card counts as an ace . Got that ? " " Yes ; I think I can remember that . " " All right ! You watch us play a while , then , till you get on to our methods of betting -- they 're different from yours too . When you think you 're wise , you can take a hand if you want to . " Boland watched for a few hands and then bought in . The game ran on for an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " lumbermen " bucked each other furiously , bluffing in a scandalous manner when they fought for a pot between themselves . Each was cleaned out several times and bought more chips . Pete won ; lost ; bought chips ; won , lost , and won again ; and repeated the process . Red and blue chips began to appear : the table took on a distinctly patriotic appearance . The lumbermen clamored to raise the ante ; Johnson steadfastly declined . Boland , playing cautiously , neither won nor lost . Dewing won quietly , mostly from the alleged lumbermen . The statement that nothing particular had occurred is hardly accurate . There had been one little circumstance of a rather peculiar nature . Once or twice , when it came Pete 's turn to deal , he had fancied that he felt a stir of cold air at the back of his neck ; cooler , at least , than the smoke-laden atmosphere of the card room . On the third recurrence of this phenomenon Pete glanced carelessly at his watch before picking up his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall behind him -- a small horizontal panel , tilted transomwise , and a peering face . Pete scanned his hand ; when he picked up his watch to restore it to his pocket , the peering face was gone and the panel had closed again . Boland , sitting beside Johnson , saw nothing of this . Neither did the lumbermen , though they were advantageously situated on the opposite side of the table . Pete played on , with every sense on the alert . He knocked over a pile of chips , spilling some on the floor ; when he stooped over to get them , he slipped his gun from his waistband and laid it in his lap . His curiosity was aroused . At length , on Dewing 's deal , Johnson picked up three kings before the draw . He sat at Dewing 's left ; it was his first chance to open the pot ; he passed . Dewing coughed ; Johnson felt again that current of cold air on his neck . " This must be the big mitt , " thought Pete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in passing up three kings for a raise -- that is good poker . But Dewing wants to be sure I 've got ' em . Are they going to slide me four kings ? I reckon not . It is n't considered good form to hold four aces against four kings . They 'll slip me a king-full , likely , and some one will hold an ace-full . " Obligingly Pete spread his three kings fanwise , for the convenience of the onlooker behind the panel . So doing , he noted that he held the kings of hearts , spades , and diamonds , with the queen and jack of diamonds . He slid queen and jack together . " Two aces to go with this hand would give me a heap of confidence , " he thought . " I 'm going to take a long chance . " Boland passed ; the first lumberman opened the pot ; the second stayed ; Dewing stayed ; Pete stayed , and raised . Boland passed out ; the first lumberman saw the raise . " I ought to lift this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumberman . " I want to get Scotty 's money in this pot , and I might scare him out . " Scotty , the second lumberman , hesitated for a moment , and then laid down his hand , using language . Dewing saw the raise . " Here 's where I get a cheap draw for the Dead Man 's Hand -- aces and eights . " He discarded two and laid before him , face up on the table , a pair of eights and an ace of hearts . " I 'm going to trim you fellows this time . Aces and eights have never been beaten yet . " " Damn you ! Here 's one eight you wo n't get , " said Scotty ; he turned over his hand , exposing the eight of clubs . " Must n't expose your cards unnecessarily , " said Dewing reprovingly . " It spoils the game . " He picked up the deck . " Cards ? " Pete pinched his cards to the smallest compass and cautiously discarded two of them , holding their faces close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . " Dewing complied . " Cards to you ? " he said . " Next gentleman ? " The next gentleman scowled . " I orter have raised , " he said . " Only I wanted Scotty 's money . Now , like as not , somebody 'll draw out on me . I 'll play these . " Dewing dealt himself two . Reversing his exposed cards , he shoved between them the two cards he had drawn and laid these five before him , backs up , without looking at them . " It 's your stab , Mr. Johnson , " said Dewing sweetly . Johnson skinned his hand slowly and cautiously , covering his cards with his hands , clipping one edge lightly so that the opposite edges were slightly separated , and peering between them . He had drawn the joker and the ace of diamonds . He closed the hand tightly and shoved in a stack . " Here 's where you see aces and eights beaten , " he said , addressing Dewing . " You ca n't have four eights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lumberman raised . " What are you horning in for ? " demanded Pete . " I 've got you beat . It 's Dewing 's hide I 'm after . " Dewing looked at his cards and stayed . Pete saw the raise and re-raised . The lumberman sized up to Pete 's raise tentatively , but kept his hand on his stack of chips ; he questioned Pete with his eyes , muttered , hesitated , and finally withdrew the stack of chips in his hands and threw up his cards with a curse , exposing a jack-high spade flush . Dewing 's eyes were cold and hard . He saw Pete 's raise and raised again , pushing in two stacks of reds . " That 's more than I 've got , but I 'll see you as far as my chips hold out . Wish to Heaven I had a bushel ! " Pete sized up his few chips beside Dewing 's tall red stacks . " It 's a shame to show this hand for such a pitiful little bit of money , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ? " Dewing made no move to turn over his cards . " If you feel that way about it , old-timer , " he said as he raked back his remainder of unimperiled chips , " you can go down in your pocket . " " Table stakes ! " objected Scotty . " That 's all right , " said Dewing . " We 'll suspend the rules , seeing there 's no one in the pot but Johnson and me . This game , I take it , is going to break up right now and leave somebody feeling mighty sore . If you 're so sure you 've got me beat -- dig up ! " " Cash my chips , " said Scotty . " I sat down here to play table stakes , and I did n't come to hear you fellows jaw , either . " " You shut up ! " said Dewing . " I 'll cash your chips when I play out this hand -- not before . You 're not in this . " " Hell ; you 're both of you scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dast put up a cent . " " Well , Johnson , how about it ? " jeered Dewing . " What are you going to do or take water ? " " Wo n't there ever be any more hands of poker dealt ? " asked Pete . " If I thought this was to be the last hand ever played , I 'd sure plunge right smart on this bunch of mine . " " Weakening , eh ? " sneered Dewing . " That 's enough , Pete , " said Boland , very much vexed . " We 're playing table stakes . This is no way to do . Show what you 've got and let 's get out of this . " " You let me be ! " snapped Pete . " No , Dewing ; I 'm not weakening . About how much cash have you got in your roll ? " " About fourteen hundred in the house . More in the bank if you 're really on the peck . And I paid three thousand cash for this place . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . You see how it is , " said Pete . " But I 've got a good ranch and a bunch of cattle , if you happen to know anything about them . " " Pete ! Pete ! That 's enough , " urged Boland . Pete shook him off . " Mind your own business , will you ? " he snapped . " I 'm going to show Mr. Something Dewing how it feels . " The gambler smiled coldly . " Johnson , you 're an old blowhard ! If you really want to make a man-size bet on that hand of yours , I 'll make you a proposition . " " Bet on it ? Bet on this hand ? " snarled Pete , clutching his cards tightly . " I 'd bet everything I 've got on this hand . " " We 'll see about that . I may be wrong , but I seem to have heard that you and young Mitchell have found a copper claim that 's pretty fair , and a little over . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk that you 'll keep your word . I 'll shoot the works on this hand -- cash , bank roll , and the joint , against a quarter interest in your mine . " " Son , " said Johnson , " I would n't sell you one per cent of my share of that mine for all you 've got . Come again ! " The gambler laughed contemptuously . " That 's easy enough said , " he taunted . " If you want to wiggle out of it that way , all right ! " Pete raised a finger . " Not so fast . I do n't remember that I 've wiggled any yet . I do n't want your money or your saloon . In mentioning my mine you have set an example of plain speaking which I intend to follow . I do hereby believe that you can clear Stanley Mitchell of the charge hanging over him . If you can , I 'll bet you a one-quarter interest in our mine against that evidence . I 'll take your word if you 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start before I make your confession public.  - -  Boland , you mind your own business . I 'm doing this.  - -  Well , Dewing , how about it ? " " If you think I 've got evidence to clear Stanley --  " " I do . I think you did the trick yourself , likely . " " You might as well get one thing in your head , first as last : if I had any such evidence and made any such a bet -- I 'd win it ! You may be sure of that . So you 'd be no better off so far as getting your pardner out of trouble is concerned -- and you lose a slice of mining property . If you really think I can give you any such evidence , why not trade me an interest in the mine for it ? " " I 'm not buying , I 'm betting ! Who 's wiggling now ? " " You headstrong , stiff-necked old fool , you 've made a bet ! I 've got the evidence . Your word against mine ? " " Your word against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What have you got ? I called you . " " I 've got the Dead Man 's Hand -- that 's all ! " Dewing spread out three aces and a pair of eights , and smiled exasperatingly . " You 've got what you were looking for ! I hope you 're satisfied now ! " " Yes , " said Pete ; " I 'm satisfied . Let 's see you beat this ! " He tossed his cards on the table . " Look at ' em ! A royal straight flush in diamonds , and a gun to back it ! " The gun leaped up with a click . " Come through , Dewing ! Your spy may shoot me through that panel behind me ; but if he does I 'll bore you through the heart . Boland , you 've got a gun . Watch the wall at my back . If you see a panel open , shoot ! Hands on the table , lumbermen ! " " Do n't shoot ! I 'll come through , " said Dewing , coolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil ! Where did you get those cards ? " " Call your man in from that panel . My back itches and so does my trigger finger . " " What do you think I am -- a fool ? Nobody 's going to shoot you . " Dewing raised his voice : " Come on in , Warren , hands up , before this old idiot drills me . " " Evidence , " remarked Johnson softly , " is what I am after . Evidence ! I have no need of any corpses . Boland , you might go through Mr. Warren and those other gentlemen for guns . Never mind Dewing ; I 'll get his gun , myself , after the testimony . Dewing might play a trick on you if you get too close . That 's right . Pile ' em in the chair . Now , Mr. Dewing -- you were to give some testimony , I believe . " " You 'll get it . I robbed Wiley myself . But I 'm damned if I tell you any more till you tell me where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cards I dealt you . I never took my eyes off of you . " " Your eyes are all right , son , " said Johnson indulgently , " but you made your play too strong . You showed an ace and two eights . Then , when Mr. Scotty obliged by flashing another eight , I knowed you was to deal me two aces for confidence cards and two more to yourself , to make out a full hand to beat my king-full . So I discarded two kings . Turn ' em over , Boland . I took a long chance . Drew to the king , queen , and jack of diamonds . If one of the aces I got in the draw had been either hearts or black , I 'd have lost a little money ; and there 's an end . As it happened , I drew the diamond ace and the joker , making ace , king , queen , jack , and ten -- and this poker game is hereby done broke up . I 'm ready for the evidence now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . I told you I 'd not implicate any one but myself , and I wo n't . I robbed Wiley so I could saw it off on Stan . You know why , I guess , " said Dewing . " If you 'll ask that little Bobby kid of Jackson Carr 's , he 'll tell you that Stan lost his spur beyond Hospital Springs about sunset on the night of the robbery , and did n't find it again . The three of us rode in together , and the boy can swear that Stan had only one spur . " I saw the spur when we were hunting for it ; I saw how it would help me get Stan out of the way ; so I said nothing , and I went back that night and got it . I dropped it near where I held Wiley up , and found it again , very opportunely , when I came back to Cobre with the posse . Every one knew that spur ; that was how the posse came to search Stan 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was sure to be found . That 's all I am going to tell you , and that 's enough . If it will make you feel any better about it , though , you may be pleased to know that Bat Wiley and most of them were acting in good faith . " " That is quite satisfactory . The witness is excused , " said Pete . " And I 'll give you twelve hours to leave Tucson before I give out the news . " " Twelve minutes is quite enough , thank you . My address will be Old Mexico hereafter , and I 'll close out the shop by mail . Anything else ? " " Why , yes ; you might let me have that gun of yours as a keepsake . No ; I 'll get it , " said Pete kindly . " You just hold up your hands . Well , we got ta be going . We 've had a pleasant afternoon , have n't we ? Good-bye , gentlemen ! Come on , Boland ! " They backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between ten and eleven , Stanley Mitchell came forth from Tucson Jail . Pete Johnson was not there to meet him ; fearing espionage from Cobre , he sent Boland , instead . Boland led the ex-prisoner to the rendezvous , where Pete and Joe Benavides awaited their coming with four saddle horses , the pick of the Benavides caballada , and two pack-horses . Except for a small package of dynamite -- a dozen sticks securely wrapped , an afterthought that Pete put into effect between poker game and supper-time -- the packs contained only the barest necessities , with water kegs , to be filled later . The four friends were riding light ; but each carried a canteen at the saddle horn , and a rifle . They rode quietly out through the southern end of the town , Joe Benavides leading the way . They followed a trail through Robles ' Pass and westward through the Altar Valley . They watered at the R E Ranch at three in the morning , waking Barnaby Robles ; him they bound to silence ; and there they let their horses rest and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . Then they pushed on , to waste no brief coolness of the morning hours . Pete kept word and spirit of his promise to Dewing ; not until day was broad in the sky did he tell Stanley of Dewing 's disclosure , tidings that displeased Stanley not at all . It was a gay party on that bright desert morning , though the way led through a dismal country of giant cactus , cholla and mesquite . Pete noted with amusement that Stanley and Frank-Francis showed some awkwardness and restraint with each other . Their clipped g 's were carefully restored and their conversation was otherwise conducted on the highest plane . The dropping of this superfluous final letter had become habitual with Stanley through carelessness and conformance to environment . With Boland it was a matter of principle , practiced in a spirit of perversity , in rebellion against a world too severely regulated . By ten in the morning the heat drove them to cover for sleep and nooning in the scanty shade of a mesquite motte . Long before that , the two young gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once more comfortably dropped . But poor Boland , by this time , was ill at ease in body . He was not inexperienced in hard riding of old ; and in his home on the northern tip of Manhattan , where the Subway goes on stilts and the Elevated runs underground , he had allowed himself the luxury of a saddle horse and ridden no little , in a mild fashion . But he was in no way hardened to such riding as this . Mr. Peter Johnson was gifted with prescience beyond the common run ; but for this case , which would have been the first thought for most men , his foresight had failed . During the long six-hour nooning Boland suffered with intermittent cramps in his legs , wakeful while the others slept . He made no complaint ; but , though he kept his trouble from words , he could not hold his face straight . When they started on at four o'clock , Pete turned aside for the little spring in Coyote Pass , instead of keeping to the more direct but rougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first planned . Boland promised to be something of a handicap ; which , had he but known it , was all the better for the intents of Mr. Something Dewing. * * * * * For Mr. Dewing had not made good his strategic retreat to Old Mexico . When Pete Johnson left the card room Dewing disappeared , indeed , taking with him his two confederates . But they went no farther than to a modest and unassuming abode near by , known to the initiated as the House of Refuge . There Mr. Dewing did three things : first , he dispatched messengers to bring tidings of Mr. Johnson and his doings ; second , he wrote to Mr. Mayer Zurich , at Cobre , and sent it by the first mail west , so that the stage should bring it to Cobre by the next night ; third , he telegraphed to a trusty satellite at Silverbell , telling him to hold an automobile in readiness to carry a telegram to Mayer Zurich , should Dewing send such telegram later . Then Dewing lay down to snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his Eastern friend were foregathered with Joe Benavides , they reported ; there were horses in evidence -- six horses . Mr. Dewing rose and took station to watch the jail from a safe place ; he saw Stanley come out with Boland . The so-called lumbermen had provided horses in the meanwhile . Unostentatiously , and at a safe distance , the three followed the cavalcade that set out from the Benavides house . Dewing posted his lumbermen in relays -- one near the entrance of Robles ' Pass ; one beyond the R E Ranch , which they circled to avoid ; himself following the tracks of the four friends until he was assured , beyond doubt , that they shaped their course for the landmark of Baboquivari Peak . Then he retraced his steps , riding slowly perforce , lest any great dust should betray him . In the burning heat of noon he rejoined Scotty , the first relay ; he scribbled his telegram on the back of an old envelope and gave it to Scotty . That worthy spurred away to the R E Ranch ; the hour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewing followed at a slowed gait . Scotty delivered the telegram to his mate , who set off at a gallop for Tucson . Between them they covered the forty miles in four hours , or a little less . Before sunset an auto set out from Silverbell , bearing the message to Cobre. * * * * * At that same sunset time , while Pete Johnson and his friends were yet far from Coyote Pass , Mayer Zurich , in Cobre , spoke harshly to Mr. Oscar Mitchell . " I do n't know where you get any finger in this pie , " he said implacably . " You did n't pay me to find any mines for you . You hired me to hound your cousin ; and I 've hounded him to jail . That lets you out . I would n't push the matter if I were you . This is n't New York . Things happen providentially out here when men persist in shoving in where they 're not wanted . " " I have thought of that , " said Mitchell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth your while to know that I have copies of all your letters and reports . I brought them to Arizona with me . I have left them in the hands of my confidential clerk , at a place unknown to you , with instructions to place them in the hands of the sheriff of this county unless I return to claim them in person within ten days , and to proceed accordingly . " Zurich stared at him and laughed in a coarse , unfeeling manner . " Oh , you did , hey ? Did you think of that all by yourself ? Did it ever occur to you that I have your instructions , over your own signature , filed away , and that they would make mighty interesting reading ? Your clerk can proceed accordingly any time he gets good and ready . Go on , man ! You make me tired ! You 've earned no share in this mine , and you 'll get no share unless you pay well for it . If we find the mine , we 'll need cash money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can get all the money we want without yours . Go on away ! You bother me ! " " I have richly earned a share without putting in any money , " said Mitchell with much dignity . " This man Johnson , that you fear so much -- I have laid him by the heels for several years to come , and left you a clear field . Is that nothing ? " " You poor , blundering , meddling , thick-headed fool , " said Zurich unpleasantly ; " ca n't you see what you 've done ? You 've locked up our best chance to lay a finger on that mine . Now I 'll have to get your Cousin Stanley out of jail ; and that wo n't be easy . " " What for ? " " So I can watch him and get hold of the copper claim , of course . " " Why do n't you leave him in jail and hunt for the claim till you find it ? " demanded lawyer Mitchell , willing to defer his triumph until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Yes ; we might find it in a million years , maybe , or we might find it in a day . Pima County alone is one fourth the size of the State of New York . And the claim may be in Yuma County , Maricopa , or Pinal -- or even in Old Mexico , for all we know . We feel like it was somewhere south of here ; but that 's only a hunch . It might as well be north or west . And you do n't know this desert country . It 's simply hell ! To go out there hunting for anything you happen to find -- that 's plenty bad enough . But to go out at random , hunting for one particular ledge of rock , when you do n't know where it is or what it looks like -- that is not to be thought of . Too much like dipping up the Atlantic Ocean with a fountain pen to suit me ! " " Then , by your own showing , " rejoined Mitchell triumphantly , " I am not only entitled to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the biggest share . I met this ignorant mountaineer , of whom you stand in such awe , took his measure , and won his confidence . What you failed to do by risk , with numbers on your side , what you shrink from attempting by labor and patience , I have accomplished by an hour 's diplomacy . Johnson has given me full directions for finding the mine -- and a map . " " What ? Johnson would never do that in a thousand years ! " " It is as I say . See for yourself . " Mitchell displayed the document proudly . Zurich took one look at that amazing map ; then his feelings overcame him ; he laid his head on the table and wept . Painful explanation ensued ; comparison with an authentic map carried conviction to Mitchell 's whirling mind . " And you thought you could take Johnson 's measure ? " said Zurich in conclusion . " Man , he played with you . It is by no means certain that Johnson will like it in jail . If he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near your cousin , he may grow suspicious . And if he ever gets after you , the Lord have mercy on your soul ! Well , there comes the stage . I must go and distribute the mail . Give me this map of yours ; I must have it framed . I would n't take a fortune for it . Tinhorn Mountain ! Dear , oh , dear ! " He came back a little later in a less mirthful mood . Had not the crestfallen Mitchell been thoroughly engrossed with his own hurts , he might have perceived that Zurich himself was considerably subdued . " It is about time for you to take steps again , " said Zurich . " Glance over this letter . It came on the stage just now . Dated at Tucson last night . " Mitchell read this : DEAR MISTER : Johnson is back and no pitch hot . Look out for yourself . He over-reached me ; he knows who got Bat Wiley 's money , and he can prove it . He thinks I am doing a dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him . I think he means to make a dash for the mine to-night , and I 'm going to follow him till I get the direction . Of course he may go south into Mexico . If he does he 'll have too big a start to be caught . But if he goes west , you can head him off and cut sign on him . Slim is at Silverbell , waiting with a car to bring you a wire from me , which I 'll send only if Johnson goes west , or thereabouts . If I send the message at all , it should follow close on this letter . Slim drives his car like a drunk Indian . Be ready . Johnson is too much for me . Maybe you can handle him . D. " I would suggest Patagonia , " said Zurich kindly . " No ; get yourself sent up to the pen for life -- that 'll be best . He would n't look for you there . " * * * * * Zurich found but three of his confederacy available -- Jim Scarboro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse camp and the shooting match -- and Eric Anderson ; but these were his best . They made a pack ; they saddled horses ; they filled canteens -- and rifles . Slim 's car came to Cobre at half-past nine . The message from Dewing ran thus : For Fishhook Mountain . Benavides , S. , J. , and another . Ten words . * * * * * Five minutes later the four confederates thundered south through the night . At daylight they made a change of horses at a far-lying Mexican rancheria , Zurich 's check paying the shot ; they bought two five-gallon kegs and lashed them to the pack , to be filled when needed . At nine in the morning they came to Fishhook Mountain . Fishhook Mountain is midmost in the great desert ; Quijotoa Valley , desolate and dim , lies to the east of it , gullied , dust-deviled , and forlorn . The name gives the mountain 's shape -- two fishhooks bound together back to back , one prong to the east , the other to the west , the barbs pointing to the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook ; three miles west , on the main shank , an all but impassable trail climbed to Hardscrabble Tanks . At the foot of this trail , Zurich and his party halted . Far out on the eastern plain they saw , through Zurich 's spyglass , a slow procession , heading directly for them . " We 've beat ' em to it ! " said Eric . " That country out there is washed out something terrible , for all it looks so flat , " said Jim Scarboro sympathetically . " They 've got to ride slow . Gee , I bet it 's hot out there ! " " One thing sure , " said Eric : " there 's no such mine as that on Fishhook . I 've prospected every foot of it . " " They 'll noon at Sweetwater , " said Zurich . " You boys go on up to Hardscrabble . Take my horse . I 'll go over to Sweetwater and hide out in the rocks to see what I can find out . There 's a stony place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unsaddle and water . Leave the pack here , you 'd better , and my saddle . They are not coming here -- nothing to come for . You can sleep , turn about , one watching the horses , and come on down when you see me coming back . " It was five hours later when the watchers on Hardscrabble saw the Johnson party turn south , up the valley between barb and shank of the mountain ; an hour after that Zurich rejoined them , as they repacked at the trail foot , and made his report : " I could n't hear where they 're going ; but it is somewhere west or westerly , and it 's a day farther on . Say , it 's a good thing I went over there . What do you suppose that fiend Johnson is going to do ? You would n't guess it in ten years . You fellows all know there 's only one way to get out of that Fishhook Valley -- unless you turn round and come back the way you go in ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been down this way before . " " You can get out through Horse-Thief Gap , ' way in the southwest . There 's a place near the top where there 's just barely room for a horse to get through between the cliffs . You can ride a quarter mile and touch the rocks on each side with your hands . Johnson 's afraid some one will see those tracks they 're makin ' and follow ' em up . I heard him tellin ' it . So the damned old fool has lugged dynamite all the way from Tucson , and after they get through he 's going to stuff the powder behind some of those chimneys and plug Horse-Thief so damn full of rock that a goat ca n't get over , " said Zurich indignantly . " Now what do you think of that ? Most suspicious old idiot I ever did see ! " " I call it good news . That copper must be something extraordinary , or he 'd never take such a precaution , " said Eric . Zurich answered as they saddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would have lost forty miles . As it is , they gain twenty miles on us while we ride back round the north end of the mountain , besides an hour I lost hoofing it back . " " I do n't see that we 've lost much , " said Jim Scarboro . " We 've got their direction and our horses are fresh beside of theirs . We 'll make up that twenty miles and be in at the finish to-morrow ; we 're four to four . Let 's ride . " Tall Eric rubbed his chin . " That Benavides , " he said , " is a tough one . He is a known man . He 's as good as Johnson when it comes to shooting . " " I 'm not afraid of the shooting , and I 'm not afraid of death , " said Zurich impatiently ; " but I am leery about that cussed old man . He 'll find a way to fool us -- see if he do n't ! " * * * * * A strong wind blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from the sagebrush country to avoid the worst sand , and bent north to a long half-circle , through a country of giant saguaro and clumped yuccas ; once they passed over a neck of lava hillocks thinly drifted over with sand . The heat was ghastly ; on their faces alkali dust , plastered with sweat , caked in the stubble of two days ' growth ; their eyes were red-rimmed and swollen . Boland , bruised and racked and cramped , suffered agonies . It was ten in the morning when Joe touched Pete 's arm : " Que cosa ? " He pointed behind them and to the north , to a long , low-lying streak of dust . " Trouble , Don Hooaleece ? I think so -- yes . " They had no spyglass ; but it was hardly needed . The dust streak followed them , almost parallel to their course . It gained on them . They changed their gait from a walk to a trot . The dust came faster ; they were pursued . That was a weird race . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot that jarred poor Boland to the bone . After an hour , during which the pursuers gained steadily , Pete called a halt . They took the packs from the led animals and turned them loose , to go back to Fishhook Mountain ; they refilled their canteens from the kegs and pressed on . The pursuit had gained during the brief delay ; plainly to be seen now , queer little bobbing black figures against the north . They rode on , a little faster now . But at the end of half an hour the black figures were perceptibly closer . " They 're gaining on us , " said Boland , turning his red-lidded eyes on Stan . " They have better horses , or fresher . " " No , " said Stan ; " they 're riding faster -- that 's all . They have n't a chance ; they ca n't keep it up at the rate they 're doing now . They 're five miles to the north , and it is n't far to the finish . See that huddle of little hills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the south ? That 's our place , and we ca n't be caught before we get there . Pete is saving our horses ; they 're going strong . These fellows are five miles away yet . They 've shot their bolt , and they know it . " He was right . The bobbing black shapes came abreast -- held even -- fell back -- came again -- hung on , and fell back at last , hopelessly distanced when the goal was still ten miles away . Pete and his troop held on at the same unswerving gait -- trot , trot , trot ! The ten miles became nine -- eight -- seven --  Sharp-eyed Benavides touched Pete 's arm and pointed . " What 's that ? By gar , eet is a man , amigo ; a man in some troubles ! " It was a man , a black shape that waved a hat frantically from a swell of rising ground a mile to the south . Pete swerved his course . " You 've got the best horse , Joe . Gallop up and see what 's wrong . I 'm afraid it 's Jackson Carr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benavides ; the Mexican turned and swung his hat ; the three urged their wearied horses to a gallop . " Trouble ? " said Pete , leaping down . " Bobby . I tied up his pony and hobbled the rest . At daylight they was n't in sight . Bobby went after ' em . I waited a long time and then I hobbled off down here to see . Wagon 's five or six miles north . One of my spans come from down in Sonora , somewhere -- Santa Elena , wherever that is -- and I reckon they 're dragging it for home and the others have followed , unless -- unless Bob 's pony has fallen , or something . He did n't take any water . He could follow the tracks back here on this hard ground . But in the sand down there -- with all this wind --  " His eye turned to the shimmering white sandhills along the south , with the dust clouds high above them . " Boland , you 'll have to give Carr your horse , " said Pete . " It 's his boy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light a big blaze when we find him , and another on this edge of the sandhills in case you do n't see the first . We 'll make two of ' em , a good ways apart , if everything is all right . You take a canteen and crawl under a bush and rest a while . You need it . If you feel better after a spell , you can follow these horse tracks back and hobble along to the wagon ; or we can pick you up as we come back . Come on , boys ! " " But your mine ? " said Carr . He pointed to a slow dust streak that passed along the north . " I saw you coming -- two bunches . Ai n't those fellows after your mine ? ' Cause if they are , they 'll sure find it . You 've been riding straight for them little hills out there all alone in the big middle of the plain . " " Damn the mine ! " said Pete . " We 've been playing . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no use splitting up and sending one or two to the mine . That mine is a four-man job . So is this ; and a better one . We 're all needed here . To hell with the mine ! Come on ! " * * * * * They found Bobby , far along in the afternoon , in the sandhills . His lips were cracked and bleeding ; his tongue was beginning to blacken and swell ; his eyes were swollen nearly shut from alkali dust , and there was an ugly gash in the hair 's edge above his left ear ; he was caked with blood and mire , and he clung to the saddle horn with both hands -- but he drove six horses before him . They gave him , a little at a time , the heated water from their canteens . A few small drinks cheered him up amazingly . After a big soapweed was touched off for a signal fire , he was able to tell his story . " Naw , I ai n't hurt none to speak of ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and catched up with them in the aidge of the sandhills , " he said . " I got ' em all unhobbled but old Heck ; and then that ornery Nig horse kicked me in the head -- damn him ! Knocked me out quite a spell . Sun was middlin ' high when I come to -- horses gone , and the cussed pony trailed along after them . It was an hour or two before I caught sight of ' em again . I was spitting cotton a heap . Dad always told me to carry water with me , and I sure was wishing I 'd minded him . Well , I went ' way round and headed ' em off -- and , dog-gone , they up and run round me . That Zip horse was the ringleader . Every time , just as I was about to get ' em turned , he 'd make a break and the rest would follow , hellity-larrup ! Old Heck has cut his feet all to pieces with the hobbles -- old fool ! I headed ' em four or five times -- five , I guess -- and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stopped and went to grazing . After a while the pony snagged his bridle in a bush and I got him . Then I dropped my twine on old Heck and unhobbled him , and come on back . Give me another drink , Pete . " They rode back very slowly to the northern edge of the sandhills and lighted their two signal fires . An answering fire flamed in the north , to show that Boland had seen their signals . " I reckon we 'll stop and rest here a while till it gets cooler , " observed Pete . " Might as well , now . We can start in an hour and get in to the wagon by dark . Reckon Frank Boland was glad to see them two fires ! I bet that boy sure hated to be left behind . Pretty tough -- but it had to be done . This has been a thunderin ' hard trip on Frankie and he 's stood up to it fine . Good stuff ! " He turned to the boy : " Well , Bobby , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em , did n't you , son ? " " That 's what I went after , " said Bobby . * * * * * Boland stiffened after his rest . He made two small marches toward the wagon , but his tortured muscles were so stiff and sore that he gave it up at last . After he saw and answered the signal fires he dropped off to sleep . He was awakened by a jingling of spurs and a trampling of hoofs . He got to his feet hurriedly . Four horsemen reined up beside him -- not Pete Johnson and his friends , but four strangers , who looked at him curiously . Their horses were sadly travel-stained . " Anything wrong , young man ? We saw your fire ? " " No -- not now . " Boland 's thoughts were confused and his head sang . He attributed these things to sleepiness ; in fact , he was sickening to a fever . " You look mighty peaked , " said the spokesman . " Got water ? Anything we can do for you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well played out . And I 've been anxious . There was a boy lost , or hurt -- I do n't know which . But it 's all right now . They lit two fires . That was to be the signal if there was nothing seriously wrong . I let the boy 's father take my horse -- man by the name of Carr . " " And the others ? That was Pete Johnson , was n't it ? He went after the boy ? " " Yes . And young Mitchell and Joe Benavides . " Zurich glanced aside at his companions . Dorsey 's back was turned . Jim Scarboro was swearing helplessly under his breath . Tall Eric had taken off his hat and fumbled with it ; the low sun was ruddy in his bright hair . Perhaps it was that same sun which flamed so swiftly in Zurich 's face . " We might as well go back , " he said dully , and turned his horse 's head toward the little huddle of hills in the southwest . Boland watched them go with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * " Jackson , " said Pete in the morning , " you and Frank stay here . I reckon there 'll be no use to take the wagon down to the old claim ; but us three are going down to take a look , now we 've come this far . Frank says he 's feeling better , but he do n't look very peart . You get him to sleep all you can . If we should happen to want you , we 'll light a big fire . So long ! " " Don Hooaleece , " said Benavides , very bright-eyed , when they had ridden a little way from camp , " how is eet to be ? Eef eet is war I am wis you to ze beeg black box . " " Joe , " said Pete , " I 've dodged and crept and slid and crawled and climbed . I 've tried to go over , under , and around . Now I 'm going through . " They came to the copper hill before eight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments scattered on all the surrounding hills , and a big monument on the highest point of the little hill they had called their own . " They 've gone , " said Stan . " Very wise of them . Well , let 's go see the worst . " They dismounted and walked to the hilltop . The big monument , built of loose stones and freshly dug slabs of ore , flashed green and blue in the sun . Stan found a folded paper between two flat stones . " Here 's their location notice , " he said . He started to unfold it ; a word caught his eye and his jaw dropped . He held the notice over , half opened , so that Pete and Joe could see the last paragraph : And the same shall be known as the Bobby Carr Mine . WITNESSES Jim Scarboro William Dorsey Eric Anderson C. Mayer Zurich LOCATORS Peter Wallace Johnson Stanley Mitchell " Zere is a note , " said Joe ; " I see eet wizzinside . " Stanley unfolded the location notice . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it aloud : Pete : We did not know about the boy , or we would have helped , of course . Only for him you had us beat . So this squares that up .
