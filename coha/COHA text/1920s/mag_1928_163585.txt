Oh yes , said Senator Fess , who is to keynote at the Republican convention , President Coolidge would accept the nomination if , to escape deadlock , the convention should draft him . <P> Oh yes , said Vermont , the Vermont delegates were not merely uninstructed but reserved for President Coolidge . <P> Oh yes , said Connecticut , the Connecticut delegation would go uninstructed . <P> In Chicago , the Coolidge movement was permitted to continue at the Mayor William Hale Thompson headquarters . In Manhattan , the same movement was kept alive in a suaver fashion by G. O. Politicians Charles Dewey Hilles and George Morris . <P> And then , the primary in Massachusetts approached . The same thing that was happening elsewhere began to happen in Massachusetts . This time President Coolidge wrote a note to Chairman Francis Prescott of the Republican State Committee and to him said : " Report has come to me that some persons in Massachusetts are proposing to write in my name as a candidate for President at the primaries on April 24 . Such action would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment that is intended , I request that it not be done . <P> " My name is being used in other States in a way that is contrary to my wishes . I have heard that in New York it has gone so far as to be claimed such use is with my tacit consent . <P> " In my own State to give any countenance to such a movement would tend to compromise me and lend color to the misrepresentations that apparently are being made in other States . <P> " I am , therefore , sending you this public declaration of my position and requesting that such attempts be discontinued . " <P> Mr. Prescott and many another read the note , read it again . <P> It referred specifically only to New York .

No , because like all other Coolidge statements on the subject it omitted the final renunciation , the I-will-not-accept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hilles and Morris of New York . <P> His Massachusetts note , said most observers , was simply a repetition of his original choice , coupled with a patient request to the G. O. P. not to come running to him before it had gotten hurt . His silence beyond this seemed to assure the party-and no statesman 's silence was ever more eloquent-that if the party was really about to get hurt , he would be there , of course . <P> <P> Apropos the resurgence of Coolidge-Anyway , on the very morning that President Coolidge 's note to Massachusetts was released , the New York World , whose interest in Democrat Smith might be expected to make it help the nomination of the least formidable Republican candidate , published one of its bold uncompromising editorials , entitled " The Candidacy of Mr. Hoover . " The World said : <P> " . . . The Republican leaders know that as against Gov . Smith their local tickets in the cities all the way from Boston to Chicago are going to be dangerously threatened . Naturally they are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert this danger .
