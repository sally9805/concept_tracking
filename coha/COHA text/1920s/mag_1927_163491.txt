Trevor and Charlotte are clever but a little disagreeable . They take after their father , Charles Frobisher , one of the solemn critics whom Norman Crowne despised . <P> The Crownes soon get used to hearing people speak as if some hereditary tragedy were certain to overtake them . After the war they live together in London where they are regarded as twin comets of disaster . Their charm is sufficient to make everybody want to know them , sufficient also to make everyone want to be in at the death of their airy and desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as romantic as a soap bubble , and that 's the most romantic thing I can think of . ... You see it drifting into all sorts of dangers and just missing them , till it seems an absolute marvel it can last so long . The whole romance of it is that you know it must come to grief .

Restraining a last minute eagerness to run away from the country wedding , Emily waits until she reaches London on the first night of her honeymoon to dodge Philip and go back to her brother . But at the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his loneliness . So Emily goes back to Philip . <P> William and Tilli go down to Monk 's Hall , where Trevor at his cousin 's expense has organized an asylum for greedy and communistic artists . Tilli 's purpose has a great deal to do with Trevor , whose casual desertion of her in London has moved her to the effort of retaliation . Monk 's Hall is swept by the draughts of a thousand petty enmities , jealousies , hungers , hatreds . When William finds Trevor in his wife 's bedroom he does the natural thing , the thing that was expected of him . He takes a shotgun and follows him into the woods that surround Monk 's Hall .
