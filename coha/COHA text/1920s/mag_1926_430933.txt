CARDINAL GASQUET Dean of the College of Cardinals and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church , under whose supervision the work of revising the Latin Bible is now going forward See page 198 INCE the United States is contemplating a conversion of its State Laws for divorce into one Federal Law on the subject it is worth while inquiring into the purposes served by that institution . First of all , it must be borne in mind that the terms on which divorces are granted in any country have no bearing whatsoever on the chastity of its inhabitants . That can be proved by contrasting the moral conditions of Ireland and Spain . In both these countries there is no divorce at all . But in Ireland there is a lack of interest in sexual relations which makes young people submit without impatience to marriages of convenience and keeps the illegitimate birthrate down to nearly nothing at all ; and in Spain there is such an excessive interest in sexual relations that it is embarrassing for a woman of anything under middle age to walk through a  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction of all the men to her charms . The political consequences of these two attitudes are , by the way , effective illustrations of the difficulty that lies before humanity in choosing its ideals . It is true that in this sphere unchastity has in Spain as in Italy brought its punishment on itself . While the Spaniards and the Italians were annoying women in the streets and the railway trains , Mussolini and Primo de Rivera got their chance to abolish civil liberty and establish dictatorships . But the virtue of Ireland is also heavily punished . For since it is impossible to enjoy the pleasure of the sexual act without the aid of another person , and since that is the most intense pleasure we know , passion is a faint argument for altruism which no people can afford to neglect in view of certain cruel human tendencies ; and that is almost certainly the cause of the barbarities of Irish civil warfare . These examples alone should be sufficient to warn the Puritan that divorce is not an effective instrument of his aims ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no reason to suppose that a person who lives in a permanent monogamous marriage is enjoying less sexual intercourse with fewer mates than one who has been divorced once or twice or more often . It is true that since the first found it convenient and possible to enter into such a contract he must be living in a society dominated by the conception of whole-wheat monogamy ; but we have only to look at what Prohibition has done to the American nation to realize what the demand of this society , that he shall have relations with only one woman , does to him . And though the second plainly believes in a change of partners , and lives in a society sympathetic with that belief , he will soon , in view of the necessity of paying alimony and the likelihood that every lady whom he courts will make the demand that what he has undergone for other ladies he should undergo for her , find himself involuntarily leaning towards monogamy . It would indeed be curious if divorce had any bearing on the chastity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancellation of the marriage contract ; and the institution of marriage has nothing to do with chastity . The Church services of matrimony lay great stress on the duty of eternal fidelity in the bride  | and bridegroom who are being united , but that is because like all liturgies they are restating in beautiful language what is already in the hearts of the participants . Few people present themselves to be married unless they are in a state of mind when they find it easy to promise to be faithful to each other until death , and find it difficult to believe that they could ever turn to other mates . They therefore find such pleasure in taking vows of fidelity as the followers of any religion find in public confession of their faith . They get a further flush of excitement if it is put to them that in undertaking this duty , which at the time they feel they can perform with perfect ease , they are doing something noble and onerous . But in fact the institution of marriage can have no effect on the chastity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsive powers . It might aspire to them if it made adultery legally punishable , but almost every experienced society abandons the attempt to do so because ? and again a comparison with Prohibition is instructive ? the effort to punish a crime which can be committed easily and with little risk of detection is bound to lead to the romanticization of that particular crime and the encouragement of all crimes by the ridicule it casts upon the law . Society has tried to get round this difficulty by making the adulterer pay for his offense in cash ; but as that results in making adultery one of the available luxuries of the rich it also is unsatisfactory , particularly in any state of civilization where the class war is acute . It is true that the institution of marriage can at least form a social conviction in favor of monogamy . But there are so many loopholes in modern civilization through which a person can crawl out of the keep of legal marriage and indulge in illicit intercourse that that conviction is no longer effective . But though marriage does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very valuable functions . It renders a public psychological sanitary service by giving those who know of a union between a man and a woman a symbol to distract them from the thought of the physical aspect of that union . Anybody who has been the central figure in a scandal is bound to be shocked and nauseated by the signs of excitement of a degraded sort that they detect on the part of any individual of a low type whom they may encounter . That Miss So-and-so and Mr. This-and-that  | are lovers brings the mind right up to the stark fact of the sexual relationship between the two . That Miss So-and-so and Mr. This-and-that have been married starts the mind on a sedate trip starting with a wedding ceremony and ending in a social life in a common home . This function of marriage is like the shades of a white man 's house in the tropics let down at night between his life and the chattering natives in the darkness outside . The other uses of marriage are for the protection of children . There is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple method of ensuring that a man shall support his children . This is an enforceable matter , as chastity is not . But it renders the child another service which is hardly less im portant . It makes complete a relationship which nature has left incomplete . Few of us have cut ourselves so free from the an thropocentric attitude towards creation that we can admit without reluctance that there are disharmonies in the destiny of man , that sometimes nature implants needs which she makes no adequate effort to satisfy ; but there can be no doubt that there is a discrepancy between fatherhood and its function . A child needs a loving and beloved father to whom it can transfer some of the affection which at first it concentrates upon its mother , and thus start on its journey away from her to adult life . There is no question but that nature has not gone the best possible way about it to provide children with such fathers . The preposterously slight and momentary nature of the physical tie between father and child is not an adequate basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be reenforced by powerful psychic means . This has been done to a considerable extent by the later developments of human sexual passion , by which a man 's tenderness for his wife extends towards the child she has borne and loves ; but that is subject to ebb and flow , since a man who loves his child because he loves its mother is apt to lose his love for it if anything wrecks his relations with her . It is also done by the growth of comradeship between a father and his children when he plays and talks with them ; but the demands which education makes on the children , and industry and com merce make on the father , conspire against this nowadays . But a very powerful reenforcement is provided by the institution of marriage in that it links up a father 's feeling for his child with his  | sense of property . As a man 's children are borne of his accredited woman and tagged with his name and lodged in his home they become extensions of his personality through which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has won from it . This principle , very beautifully , operates exactly where it is most needed in society . The poor man has opportunities for becoming familiar with his children which are denied to the rich man who is distracted by a thousand interests . But the rich man is anxious to reaffirm his position in society by putting up his sons for the same school that he went to , the same college , club , regiment , or profession , and training his daughters to become the most attractive possible specimens of their class . In the course of doing this and recognizing or pretending to recognize that his children are acquitting themselves worthily , he acquires the same infatuated interest , in them that their mother does more simply during their prenatal physical relationship with her . Thus do the children get their required sense of a loving father ; and , apparently , another sense which is as vitally necessary but which it is almost impossible to state in a positive form . It can only be indicated when one comes to consider how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such consideration is sufficiently disconcerting for the determined radical who intends to regard divorce as calmly as if it were on the same level of social importance as the dissolution of business partnerships . It is plain that in certain respects divorce does the community a great deal of harm . That psychological benefit which is conferred by marriage is spectacularly revoked by divorce . It is obviously undesirable that any human beings should be powerfully affected by thoughts of sex unless they concern persons known to them with whom it is possible for them to enter into sexual relations , whether of an actual physical or a substitutionally idealist nature . Marriage , by screening the physical life of a man and woman in love with one another behind a series of symbols , takes heed of this ; but divorce , by its sweeping away of these symbols , cares not what damage it does to the public imagination . Proof of the extent of that damage is given by the false proportions which divorce assumes in the common mind , particularly among persons living  | a restricted life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chance to denounce his times , will expatiate on the prevalence of divorce . In actual fact divorce is quite uncommon . In England ninety-nine out of every hundred marriages remain undissolved . Even in America , with the immense temptations to play general post with the affections which arise out of the no madic existence that the unsettled industrial conditions impose on such a large part of its population , nine out of ten stay put . Moreover it must be remembered that many of these cases ? where there are no children or where the children are grown up , are purely private matters of no social significance whatsoever . That anything so infrequent should bulk so large in the public mind must be due not to objective but to subjective reasons ; not to the concrete effects of divorce on the community but to the nature and intensity of the fantasies that are engendered by those who read reports of divorces . But this is no encouragement to the Puritan , for oddly enough this indubitably evil effect of divorce varies in direct ratio to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exaggerated if divorce is made difficult , and diminished if it is made easy . For example : an American couple who slip over to Paris and go through the divorce mill do very little to corrupt the public imagination ; but a great deal was done to that end by the Stillmans , who had submitted themselves to a court which refused to free them unless they proved certain indecorous points about each other . ( It is a further dis couragement for the Puritan that they increased this mischief rather than undid it by their reconciliation . ) It is useless to attempt to circumvent this by prohibiting the publication of the reports of divorce cases . That would be unfair to persons cited on flimsy grounds , would enable lawyers to lay before the courts stories which if they were published would evoke a cloud of disproving witnesses , and would cause all sorts of other trouble . In fact the overwhelming arguments in favor of open courts apply to this class of case as much as to every other . The fact that all divorce is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , has to be faced . But that is a minor point compared with the harm that divorce does by its cancellation of the benefits marriage secures for the child . It does not cancel all such benefits . It does not destroy the  | financial protection given them by marriage . It is curious to reflect how much better off , so far as nutrition and education are concerned , one may be sure , are two children whose father has other two children by a wife he has married after he has been divorced by their mother and submitted to the financial decrees of a court , than they would have been had they been born a hundred years before to a permanently yoked couple who gave rein to their philoprogenitiveness and had a family of nine or ten . Divorce is perilously likely to frustrate the psychical uses of parenthood . It weakens or destroys that reenforcernent of the tie between father and child which is contrived by association with the sense of property . A man does not feel the same pride of possession in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the time and enters the sphere of another man 's possessions ; while the other man , belonging to a sex not naturally infatuated with child and possibly prejudiced against this particular one by sexual jealousy of its origin , is not likely to compensate it for this loss . There could be multiplied without end examples of the way that divorce leaves a child a parent short . It will be claimed that such calamities happen only when people do not behave as well as they might , and that no doubt is true . But even if all such difficulties were eliminated by superhuman excellence of behavior on the part of everybody concerned , the plight of the child of divorced parents would still often be tragic , because of its need of a certain mysterious benefit it would have received from the marriage of its parents had that continued : a benefit which is hard to define but necessary to believe in when one has seen the consequences of the lack of it . For there is apparently something repulsive and disturbing to the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something so repulsive and disturbing that it can paralyze all normal growth . This is a real fact . Whatever one may think of the theory of psychoanalysis one must regard as valuable the immense amount of material psychoanalysts have collected concerning the circumstances which produce neuroticism and that material shows that the step-child suffers from a very special liability to become neurotic . This is confirmed by the experience of workers among delinquent children all over the world , who find that the ungovernable and criminal child has frequently been thrown off its balance  | by the mere fact that it has a step-parent . There is nothing beautiful about this disposition of childhood . It is not a recoil from adult impurity ; it is just as likely to operate against a step-parent whose predecessor was removed not by divorce but by death . It is frequently stupid and unjust ; the other day a social worker told me a tragic story of a schoolgirl who was breaking the hearts of her decent and kindly father and stepmother because of her obstinate attempts to run away from home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her when they were together . It is utterly careless of the happiness of others ; the conventional picture of a goldenhaired tot joining the hands of its alienated parents is a grotesque prettyfication of what in real life is often a demand that would be considered preposterously cruel if it were made by an adult . It is a curious phase of insanity to which the immature mind is subject . Unfortunately , adults must humor it if they want the mature mind to be sane and healthy . Therefore persons with children who divorce merely to legitimize their sexual inclinations towards other persons ought to realize that they are in no way more admirable than they would be if in order to approach their beloveds they exposed their children to the risk of catching some dangerous infectious disease . They are playing ducks and drakes with their children 's future . They ought not to do it . One would be tempted to say that they ought not to be allowed to do it , were it not for the plain fact that it is unthinkable to deny a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruption of being familiarized by his unworthy partner with drunkenness or vice or cruelty . That must not be forgotten . There is a curious human tendency , when faced with the spectacle of a person who has had to choose between two courses of action and has been led to disaster by the one he has chosen , to assume that the choice of the other alternative would have led him to perfect happiness . This has been the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church towards divorce . Seeing that persons faced with the alternatives of remaining married or getting divorced frequently land themselves in painful situations if they choose to get divorced , it has said , " Very well , we will force our people to accept the other alternative ( by devices such as refusing both the guilty and the innocent parties  | in a suit permission to remarry ) and stay married , and then all will be well . " But there is a certain number of marriages so terrible that the effects of their continuance are worse for the children born of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of a case , well known in England , where a woman refrained from divorcing her villainous husband because of her children , with the result that before her eldest daughter was out of her teens her father had taught her to drink and induced her to become the mistress of a man who was useful to him in his business schemes . The conditions do not have to be as gross as that to produce lasting and dreadful results . I can think of a family of four sisters who have all grown up unhappy neurotics because of the terror of sex they conceived during their childhood as a result of a confused sense that their parents ' marriage was miserable . There are such tight places as these , and to deny parents the right to get themselves and their children out of them is inhuman . It may be said that the Roman Catholic attitude perfectly meets such cases ; since it gives such parents the right to free their children but not to saddle them with step-parents . But this prohibition of the remarriage of divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whose children are grown up or too young to resent the transition from parent to step-parent . It does harm to as many human beings as it benefits . Divorce , then , presents certain real problems even to the most broad-minded . It is an institution generally recognized by modern communities as necessary , but it is foolish to deny that it has certain effects which are pernicious and not easily to be rectified . In view of the enormous preference which humanity shows for not being divorced it is probable that it will never do society any formidable amount of damage . But it is unfortunate that just the very sort of people who ought to stay married , decent people who could make good homes for their children , are more and more resorting to ? the divorce courts . It is evident that there is some prevailing error of thought which prevents people from realizing what they are doing when they get divorced ; and that error is almost certainly the Puritan delusion that marriage and divorce are in some way concerned with chastity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average citizen feels  | that he must be ranged on its side . A man who is married to one woman and falls in love with another feels ( quite rightly ) that he is sinning against the ideal of chastity . If he is a victim of the Puritan delusion he works out that he can get back on to good terms with this virtue by getting divorced , if possible on fictitious grounds which have nothing to do with sex , and dragging his new lady into the sanctuary of a second marriage . It would do much to abolish the evils of divorce if he and his community were to realize that as marriage has nothing to do with chastity , but only with the decorum of society and the care of children , he has done something as irrelevant to the occasion as going and buying a dog-license ; and that any injury he has inflicted on his family in the process must be written down on the debit side of his moral account with no entry whatsoever on the credit side to offset it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will leave him faced with the problem whether he would not have been more moral if he had stayed at home and had illicit relations with the woman whom he loves instead of breaking up his home to legitimize his relations with her . It is a problem intensely disagreeable for the modern Anglo-Saxon mind to contemplate . To concede the point is to do away with the hope that one can have the fun of adultery and keep respectable by adhering to an easy formula , and it invokes working out a code of manners within marriages which are being kept going for the sake of the family which it will not be easy to devise or follow . But it is a problem that must be faced if the useful purposes of marriage are to be served .  |
