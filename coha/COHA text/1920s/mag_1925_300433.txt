Last week the sheetlets of Madrid exploded into scareheads . " SPANIARDS CAPTURE AJDIR , CAPITAL OF ABD-EL-KRIM , " they trumpeted . To the heads of Spanish patriots rushed a hot , sweet surge of triumph . <P> At a window of his palace appeared King Alfonso , to receive a frenzied ovation from his people . The roars of shirtless . peons and the cheers of hidalgos forgetful of their dignity drowned his Majesty 's words in praise of General Primo de Rivera , " the Conqueror of Ajdir . " <P> Flushed with triumph , Alfonso declared privately : " Morocco is the keystone to the prestige of the white race and of the Christian civilization in North Africa ... Spain 's war is not merely ' a little African war , as so many people seem to think ... Its consequences can be world-wide in effect ! " <P> Astute observers then went quietly away and reflected that Spain , after having poured out millions of pesetas during a desultory struggle with 25,000 Riffians which has lasted seven years , is now celebrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riff-land . Belgians , Serbians and Rumanians , they pointed out , found it quite possible to do a deal of heavy fighting after Brussels , Belgrade and Bucharest had fallen to the Central Powers . Abd-el-Krim is still at large . And the Spanish attack of last week , crowned by the fall of his " capital " though it be , represents an actual advancement of the Spanish front by a scant four miles . <P> <P> Concurrently with Spain 's spectacular nibbling at the Riff from the north , the French forces under Marshal Petain made an advance , near Kifane on the southern war front , into virgin sloughs of Riffland never before occupied by Europeans . It was announced that last week 's French offensive had gained all its objectives in record time . Then French officers discovered that their airmen , who had hastily made for them the only available maps , had mapped too optimistically . The French lines , when exactly plotted , proved to be a couple of miles short of the advance that had been claimed . A few piles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and announced to be " Aknout , ' was discovered to be something and somewhere else . None the less , the recent French advance topped heights which form the watershed of Morocco . From now on they and the torrential rains of autumn will be moving down toward the sea . Despatches indicate that authoritative mappings placed the French and Spanish forces but 25 miles apart . <P> <P> Last week Sidi Muhammad , brother of the indomitable Abd-el-Krim , called for foreign intervention in Morocco affairs . Said he : " To continue war means ruin , although we can stand another year at this rate ... Is there nobody-America , England or Italy-who is ready to speak for peace ? " <P> The U. S. airmen , Capt . L. C. Holden of New York and Dr. V. Sparks of Indianapolis , both members of the " Sheriflan Escadrille " ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) , were ambushed by Riffians and very nearly killed when they left their planes one day last week and ventured on a little pedestrian fighting .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
