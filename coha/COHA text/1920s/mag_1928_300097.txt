Smart U. S. citizens who have been fooled when attempting to pronounce the name of Baron Dalziel commonly suppose that most Englishmen utter it correctly . No supposition could be more false . <P> Florid , big-boned Baron Dalziel of Kirkcaldy , kinsman of Europe 's late Sleeping Car Tycoon Baron Dalziel of Wooler ( TIME , April 30 ) , has now said : " I have long ago given up trying to get English people to pronounce ' Dalziel ' correctly . . . . The late Lord Dalziel also accustomed himself to let the wrong pronunciation pass uncorrected . . . . He ceased to maintain the tradition that ' Dalziel ' should be pronounced ' Dee-el . ' " <P> Village folk of Kirkcaldy in Scotland and of Wooler , on the Scottish border , were discouraged last week by this Triumph of Wrong , and vexed that the fine old name of " Dee-el " has been citified and Londonized into " Dal-zeel . " <P> <P> The second most mispronounced British peer is perhaps " Lord Chumly , " spelled Cholmondeley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves " Chumly . " Last week their daughter , Lady Aline " Chumly , " presided over a charity rummage sale at Houghton Hall in Norfolk , while their youngest man child , Lord John " Chumly " donned a " cowboy suit " ( imported from the U. S. ) and took sixpences from people who wanted to dip into a bran tub for prizes of doubtful value .
