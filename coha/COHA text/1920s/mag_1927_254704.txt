The commencement program of Kentucky Military Institute at Lyndon , Ky. , near Louisville , carried the name of Mark A. Hanna III . His high marks , averaging 93% , had won him the highest honors of the 1927 class ; he was to make the valedictory address . When , later , he rose to speak , an 18-year-old oval-cheeked boy , he reminded auditors of an able man whom he had never seen-the late U. S. Senator Marcus Alonzo Hanna , his great grandfather , who died in 1904 . <P> Next fall Mark A. Hanna III will matriculate at Brown University , Providence .
