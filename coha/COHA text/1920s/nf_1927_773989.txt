txt OLIVER CROMWELL the lessons and the occasions of the first years of the Long Parliament to show men , Oliver among them , how the full impact of the revolt was to be organised and delivered . In the meantime there seemed to be no prospects of anything but civic staunchness , patient farming , an amiable domestic routine , and a devout preparation of the spirit for any call that might come . That the call if it came would be a spectacular one was in no way probable ; it was unlikely that it would ever come at all . In 163o Oliver was serving as a Justice of the Peace for the Borough of Huntingdon , but we get no glimpse of him dealing with such trespassers or suits as may have come before him . In the next year he sold his Huntingdon property and moved with his family to St. Ives where he became tenant of grazing lands lying along the banks of the Ouse at the east end of the town . Here he lived for five years , still destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bearing as might be the injustices that were so freely distributed from Whitehall among his friends and countrymen . Occasions for such fortitude were plentiful . He had heard how on the breaking of Parliament the more active promotors of Sir John Eliot 's resolution , its author among them , had been put into prison by the sentence of intimidated judges . 8o PREPARATIONS He had heard how Eliot , a man in the young prime of his life , refusing to admit that his action had been treasonable , had slowly wasted into a decline in the foul air of his cell in the Tower . And then he had doubtless heard much more of the matter from John Hampden , for Hampden held Eliot 's affection to be " a noble purchase , " and wrote many and touching letters to his friend in captivity , full of solicitude and offers of family service , now " searching my study for a booke to send you , " now offering by " this bearer . . . a buck out of my paddock . " Shameful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of them for Oliver when they met . He would be able to tell how this subject , who loved England with single-minded heroism , being grievously sick in lonely confinement , sent a request to the King , not for pardon or remission of his sentence , but that he might be set at liberty , " that for the recovery of my health I may take some fresh ayre " ; how that when the King replied that this was by no means humble enough in tone , Sir John Eliot explained that he was only asking for a temporary respite , so that " when I have recovered my health I may returne back to my prison there to undergoe such punishment as God hath allotted unto me " ; how that when the King further told the dying man that he must // acknowledge his fault and plead for pardon before any consideration could be shown him , Sir John Eliot told the King , in whatever words suited his Puritan decorum , to go to the devil ; how that his family asking that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgence was refused ; and , finally , how that when Sir John had duly died of consumption in the Tower at the age of forty , and his son begged leave to take away the body for burial , the King with a pretty wit endorsed the note , " Lett Sir John Eliot 's body be buried in the Churche of that parish where he dyed . " Then there was William Laud , who at the age of sixty became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 . He had piety and a genuine zeal for his church , but he could not endure that anyone should refuse to conform to his own doctrine and practice . A long tale of religious persecution might seem to him a sufficient example for whatever experiments in that line he might choose to make himself , but he unluckily chose to make them at a time when the people of England were suddenly determined to stand no more of it from one persuasion or another . On his elevation to the primacy Laud proceeded to hunt " lecturers " with a most diligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preacher of abominable heresies in Huntingdon . Some- // times the victim was merely suppressed , sometimes his history became obscured in the enfolding mists of the Star Chamber . It should be noted here that between Laud 's persecution of the Puritans and the general instinct in England for persecuting popery , there was this important distinction . A Roman England meant , in the minds of the people at large , an England in political bondage and finally deprived of liberty . The opposition to Catholicism was not profoundly a religious movement at all , but inspired by dread of foreign domination . Laud 's tyranny was exercised against his own countrymen , and aimed at imposing his ecclesiastical will on a conscience that rejected it . Englishmen said to Rome , " Keep away : we suspect your theology of political designs , and you smell of the Inquisition ; if you insist on coming where you are not wanted , we will drive you out relentlessly . " Laud said to Englishmen , " Acknowledge my ritual , or be outlawed . " He said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had the chance . Anti-papist demonstrations were not an attempt to make Catholics change their opinions , but a precaution against what were with very good reason believed to be Catholic intentions of making other people change theirs . The answer to Rome was the penal code against popery : the // answer to Laud was to be the Puritan Revolution . Very quietly the Puritans somehow contrived to keep a few ministries in operation , but one by one they were detected and uprooted by Laud 's consecrated enterprise . To Oliver and men of his mind the privation had a double edge ; it frustrated their spiritual needs , and it challenged on a new ground the personal liberty that was a living article of their faith . That in the time to come the Puritans became heady like other people in success and fell into extravagant follies in denial of their own gospel , does not alter the fact that these were at worst the lamentable defects of a temper that in its proper character was represented by the Petition of Right . Every great constructive movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its own " lunatic fringe , " and before the Puritan revolution had been accomplished it had some rather ugly scores to its debit account . But many cheerful censors of obvious crudities in the later Puritan reign forget that they would have had very much less reason in our modern world to be cheerful at all if Cromwell and his fellows had not once fought a despotic throne with an equal determination to serve God and keep their powder dry . It was this resolve that made Laud 's tyranny , often a // ferocious tyranny , so intolerable and finally brought Laud himself to a dismal end . When in 1636 the trustees of funds that provided lecturers in such places as they could visit with safety , suspended payment to the minister of St. Ives , Cromwell wrote to one of them urging that " surely , Mr. Stone , it were a piteous thing to see a Lecture fall , in the hands of so many able and godly men , as I am persuaded the founders of this are , in these times , wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and violence , by the enemies of God his Truth . . . . I beseech you therefore in the bowels of Jesus Christ , put it forward , and let the good man have his pay . The souls of God 's children will bless you for it ; and so shall I ; and ever rest , Your Loving Friend in the Lord , Oliver Cromwell . " That phrase , " in the bowels of Jesus Christ , " is of peculiar appositeness to our theme . Considered unhistorically , it has a musty , antiquated flavour . How fantastically would it divert the town if Mr. Ramsay MacDonald were to beseech Mr. Baldwin to do something " in the bowels of Jesus Christ . " But the levity , we think , would be uncomfortably sobered if it could be confronted by the very presence of Pym , or Hampden , or Eliot , or Cromwell testifying in such terms . We do not speak in that // way now , but we can never understand the Puritans until we realise that they spoke so out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . When Cromwell besought his correspondent thus , he did it without intending any special effect or emphasis , taking up his pen without deliberation as he came in from the crew-yard or cattle-market , to practice in the Lord who was as familiarly present to him as his own shadow in the streets of St. Ives . The idiom in which his plea was made was as far from cant as it was from profanity . Other incitements to thought were provided by the King with continued ingenuity . Irregular collection of tonnage and poundage , the imposition of levies for the militia made with open disregard of pledges , shameless traffic in monopolies , heavy penalties for anyone who refused to accept the honour of knighthood when offered it at what was considered to he a reasonable price , the revival of obsolete forest laws , these and other such abuses were the commonplaces of Charles 's policy under improvised proclamations of the Privy Council . Resistance was answered by perfunctory trial , if any , and imprisonment without hope of appeal . Blind and deaf to popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles and his advisers fondly believed that their con- // trol of the state was now firmly and , for them , prosperously established . They formed a resolution that this happy condition of affairs should never again be endangered by the importunities of Parliament . Charles Rex , said Wentworth and Laud , was a sufficient and satisfactory instrument for the government of England , and court sycophants of every kind loudly expressed their approval of so profitable a doctrine . When disobedient or critical persons were astute enough to keep outside the very pliable process of an illegal law , there were other ways of dealing with them . A suspect country gentleman could be warned to retire to his place in the shires , with a hint that his return to London would be inconvenient , chiefly to himself . A merchant of doubtful character could be ruined by being forbidden such ports as afforded him any chance of successful competition with favoured rivals . Commodities of daily use , soap , grain , wine , leather , the staple metals , glass , were given over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a liberal margin for Court dues . Oliver and his friends , then , had much upon which to reflect in the years of his farming at St. Ives . What might come of their reflection no one could foresee ; it was difficult to see how anything could come of it at all . But the Court , // emboldened by its apparent security , was by increasing excesses to provide the answer . Provocation was steadily moving to a point when the long-tried anger of the people must kindle into a terrible flame of power and purpose . Moderation in Charles and his council during the years 163o to 1635 might have altered the whole course of English history and have left us today with institutions such as our minds can hardly conceive . But moderation was unknown to them , and by follies that could he cured only by reforms as violent as they were profound , they made the Puritan Revolution inevitable . 88 VIII THE STAR CHAMBER . SHIP MONEY VIII THE STAR CHAMBER . SHIP MONEY IN 1637 new evidence of Catholic influences at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puritan champions continued to show little discrimination between the Pope at Rome and the Archbishop at Lambeth , and Laud determined upon exemplary measures . Once and for all Englishmen were to be shown that revolt against the Establishment was not to be tolerated . Three men of good birth and standing were summoned before the Star Chamber , and accused of publishing tracts subversive of episcopal authority . They were Henry Burton , aged sixty , minister of a city church ; John Bastwick , aged forty-four , a physician who had graduated at Cambridge and Padua ; and William Prynne , aged thirty-seven , a barrister of Lincoln 's Inn , and a graduate of Oriel College , Oxford . Burton and Prynne had both come into conflict with their judges before , the former in 1629 , on account of his Histriomastix , the latter in 1634 , and both had suffered imprisonment . Prynne had further had his ears // cut off in the pillory , but had found a friendly surgeon to sew them on again . It was for utterances made in prison that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All three defendants were found guilty , and on June 3oth the sentence of the Chamber was executed in Palace Yard outside Whitehall . A sullen crowd watched these three men led out and placed in the pillory , saw what then went forward , and broke out into cries of indignation that the Royal Guard was powerless to suppress . Each of the convicted men had his ears cut off , Prynne for the second time , and each was branded on the cheek with the letters S.L. , to show for ever that he was a Seditious Libeller . As he was released , Bastwick fell fainting into the arms of his wife , who somehow had bought or pleaded her way to the dreadful scene . And then the three , with the blood streaming down their faces , were led away to the completion of their sentences , which was solitary confinement for life . Soon afterwards , John Lilburne , a young man of twenty-one , was brought before the Star Chamber for being concerned in the publication of the offending pamphlets , given his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of London , and sent to reflect upon his indiscretions in one of His Majesty 's gaols . And as news of these things travelled through // England , thousands of sturdy Puritan hearts cursed Charles for a beastly and abominable King , and Laud for a beastly and abominable prelate , and swore to themselves in the bowels of Jesus Christ that a reckoning should be made . This was in 1637 . In the preceding year , Oliver had inherited his Uncle Thomas Stewart 's property at Ely , and had removed thither with his family . While he had been at St. Ives his mother had continued to live at Huntingdon , but she now rejoined her son in the home of her own childhood . The little that we know of the household leaves a faint but secure impression of domestic peace as Oliver , now approaching forty , cared for his mother , his wife and his children . Turbulent thoughts were rising in his mind as these tidings of infamous happenings in London came down to his new fenland home , but within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his bishops in Scotland at about the same time that he showed Prynne and the others what was what . At least , he tried to do so , but on the first attempt to read the Liturgy in an Edinburgh church a certain Jenny Geddes flung a historical stool at the episcopal head and defied any Pope to say mass in that company . News of this also may have reached Oliver , as certainly did the account of // yet another shocking display of indocility from one very well qualified to speak . The growing opposition to the Court at home found the credit of the country abroad sunk to its lowest ebb . The wars with France and Spain had come to an ignominious end , their very uncertain purposes having been wholly unachieved . The English seas were openly raided by African pirates , Holland trespassed on our fishing rights , and no foreign power troubled so much as to enquire what was the opinion of Whitehall . The successes of the King were over the laws and liberties of his own subjects , but nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought fitting to extend the sphere of operations at home , and turn the screws yet a little tighter . That the resistance to illegal taxation was daily growing more stubborn and explicit did not discourage men who were by now in a permanent state of political intoxication . One Richard Chambers , being fined two thousand pounds for disputing a levy made upon some of his merchandise , and sent to prison until he should sign a form of submission , wrote instead , " All the above said contents and submission , I , Richard Chambers , do utterly abhor and detest , as most unjust and false ; and never till death will acknowledge any part thereof . " Prynne and Bastwick and // Burton had likewise , in an extreme agony , never ceased to protest that the damnable iniquity was not theirs but the Court 's . More and more freely , in fact , men were following the example of Sir John Eliot in telling the King and his accomplices , in an expressive range of idiom , to go to the devil , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreditable condition of the country 's honour at sea suggested that fresh supplies could be raised , with some show of reason and some hope of public acquiescence , on the pretext of mending this decline . And so the expedient of Ship Money was devised . Richard Chambers , who in 1635 had somehow got out of prison after six years of confinement , now showed that the lesson had been lost on him by again resisting the King 's officers , whereupon he was again removed to gaol as incorrigible . At first the new tax met with some success , being levied only in sea-port towns that might hope for direct enjoyment of its benefits . But when Charles thereupon proposed to enforce it on all inland shires and towns , the revolt was immediate and uncompromising . The very natural suspicion that the money would not be used for its avowed purpose at all was eclipsed by a far more fundamental objection . Had nothing more than the misappropriation of public funds been involved , // the matter could have been dealt with by the ordinary processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means for the first time , but at length with critical directness , was not how the public funds were to be used but how they were to be raised ; whether , in fact , money illegally exacted could in any sense be said to be public funds at all . The general and open campaign for the levying of Ship-Money was to give the country an opportunity of declaring its mind on the policy of loot ; and presently , in decisive terms , upon the character of the looters . In 1636 a writ was issued requiring the county of Buckingham to supply a warship of four hundred and fifty tons and a hundred and eighty men and appertaining cannon , muskets , gunpowder , etc. , etc. , and to deliver the said ship fully equipped in Portsmouth harbour on an appointed date . And if ( as was likely enough ) the loyal subjects of Buckinghamshire should be unable to build and furnish such a ship , then they were forthwith to pay a sum of four thousand and five hundred pounds into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Sheriff of the country with this demand were very coldly received , and were presented with a list of persons who proclaimed themselves as intending defaulters . And fore- // most upon this role of honour was inscribed the name of John Hampden . By popular consent Hampden 's was at once accepted as a test case . He was a man of wealth , and the amount at which his personal liability was assessed was trifling ? no more than a few shillings . There could , therefore , be no question of any motive for his action other than that of public spirit . The King took counsel with his judges , being careful in his charge to let it be plainly known that any judge who valued the King 's favour would carefully consider the King 's wishes . The judges thereupon dutifully pronounced the levying of ShipMoney to be legal , and Hampden was summoned to show cause why he should not pay his lawful dues . Hampden appeared , and with his advisers flatly denied that there was anything lawful in any of these proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was judiciously called to order by the bench . Through the Hilary , Easter , and Trinity terms the case went on , not because the issue was ever in doubt , but in order to produce an effect of scrupulous forbearance and impartiality . But such was the weight of Hampden 's appeal , that even the judges were divided . One by one they gave their findings , and it was not until June 9th , 1638 , that the last judgment was delivered , // when eight of the judges had decided for the King and four for Hampden. * It is , no doubt , due to lack of vigilance on my own part , but I have nowhere been able to dis cover what happened in the matter of actual payment as a result of the decision against Hampden . It is , however , a matter of small consequence . Whether he accepted the judg ment of the Court or not , we know that he abated nothing of his opposition to the principle that had been thus inconclusively tested . The fact that four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own interests , had de fied the crown , gave heart to the Puritan party throughout the country . On the other hand , knowledge that the judgment had in fact gone against him , in spite of arguments that nobody would hear without being persuaded in his con-science , showed Hampden and the other leaders of the movement how seemingly desperate were the odds against which they had to contend . In such a condition of mind we can imagine Oliver and his cousin to have met in these times . While John 's trial had been going forward , Oliver // himself had conducted a process of his own in the name of freedom . A local problem of great importance to the people of his neighbourhood was the draining of the fens . Enlightened opinion was favourable to the scheme in so far as it concerned land improvement , but decidedly opposed to it in so far as it proposed to grant certain advantages to be derived therefrom to the Bedford family by royal favour . To improve the land for public use was one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Cromwell led the opposition , and at a mass meeting in Huntingdon presented the people 's case not against the draining but against the private exploitation of the Bedford Level . The incident enhanced his reputation in the district for liberality and fearlessness ; marked him as a man whom others might safely follow if there should be yet a bolder bid made in the cause of ancient liberties . We can not question the literal simplicity of a confession made by Oliver in a letter to a friend at this time : " If here I may honour my God either by doing or by suffering , I shall be most glad . " For the moment , however , the way to effective national action remained obscure . Large numbers of Puritans , hopeless of repairing their condition in England , were emigrating to the New World . It is said that Hampden and Cromwell were // themselves preparing to follow this example , had , indeed , actually embarked , when an order of the King in Council forbade any man to leave the country without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so , with incomparable irony of circumstance , Cromwell was detained to do his work in England by Charles 's intervention . Ioo IX THE SHORT PARLIAMENT IX THE SHORT PARLIAMENT SUDDENLY the situation cleared . Scotch resistance to Laud 's attempt at imposing his ritual on the Kirk roused the country to a high pitch of excitement . People of all ranks joined in a Covenant to preserve the Presbyterian faith . Orders from Whitehall and from Lambeth were alike ignored , and any attempt to read the new service produced rioting in the churches . At length Charles decided on active measures ; but he had no means of carrying them out . Scraping together some semblance of an army with money raised by further forced loans under the authority of the Privy Council , he set out for the north to bring the insurgents to their senses . On his arrival he found them presenting far too formidable a front to encourage a trial by arms , and the terms of an agreement were hastily improvised . Returning to London from this abortive expedition , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vindicated . But how ? The answer was extremely mortifying , but it was the only one . Io3 OLIVER CROMWELL Clearly a real army must be organised , and as clearly this could not be done without ample and regular supplies . These , on the necessary scale , could only be obtained by popular consent , which deplorably meant the calling of the vipers back to Westminster . Early in 164o Parliament was summoned after an interval of eleven years , and assembled on April 13th . It represented the fine flower of English character . The King 's party was itself fortunate in the allegiance of men who sought to restore honour to a corrupt cause , Lucius Cary Lord Falkland , Sir Bevill Grenvil and others , among them Edward Hyde , now a young man of thirty , who did not allow his royalist sympathies to condone the grave and dangerous practices of the Court . The opposition of such men gave an added sense of responsibility to the Puritan members who met with the consciousness that their duty was not to make a hightempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and weighty expression of the people 's will . And their sessions were in fact distinguished for the most part by an equable steadiness and restraint , by a refusal either to be provoked or to be intimidated . Oliver Cromwell was returned as one of the members for Cambridge . As soon as the King presented his demands // for subsidies , the House let it be clearly understood that while every consideration would be shown for contracted liabilities , and a disposition to forget past irregularities , nothing at all could be done in the matter of supplies until a sufficient guarantee was given against grievances in the future . This meant a definition of the grievances , which would take time , and the King was in a hurry . Also it meant that the House was dictating methods of procedure instead of doing as it was told , and the King was as obstinate as ever . Before any business could be done , this question of " supplies before grievances " or " grievances before supplies " had to be settled . In vain Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give any guarantees they asked . The royal word had been tried too often and found wanting . The Puritan majority would not concede an inch of ground . Pym and Hampden , moderate in speech and inflexible in temper , led the Puritan debate . Hyde made ingenious attempts to effect a compromise , and failed . The Commons would vote not a penny until security of and personal freedom was assured ; they even went further , and suggested that instead of making war on the Scots , Charles should make a rational peace with them . Wentworth told the King that to yield on the one point meant a IO5 OLIVER CROMWELL definite surrender of his prerogative , and Laud told him that . to yield on the other meant the coming of ecclesiastical anarchy . The counsel on both hands was as infatuated as it could be , but Charles , with his unerring instinct for doing the wrong thing , followed it . On May 5th , he summoned the Commons to the bar of the House of Lords , and in a speech of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sat for three weeks . But contempt could no longer serve Charles 's turn . The following months were to see his last desperate effort to govern by arbitrary enactment ; and then the breach was to be irreparable . The King 's conduct on the termination of the Short Parliament was marked by what can only be termed demoniac stupidity . Nothing could be more legible than the writing that was inexorably tracing itself on the wall , and yet he could not or would not read it . Mobs assembled in the streets murmuring imprecations ; placards were paraded denouncing Laud as anti-Christ ; the gates of Lambeth were threatened ; ballad-singers offended the precincts of Whitehall with most unkingly burdens ; strange drums broke the silence of the city nights . And in face of it all , with a courage too gross for sanity , Charles again placed some of the banished members under arrest , caused the persons io6 THE SHORT PARLIAMENT of suspect noblemen to be searched for treasonable papers , issued an edict expressly declaring that he was " accountable to God alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of Ship Money and other imposts , and made bemused preparations to follow the grotesque Scotch adventure of the preceding year with another Bishop 's War . The second exploit ended even more ingloriously than the first . The Scots were neither to be coerced by episcopal argument , nor defeated in the field by Charles 's exceedingly ragged regiments . The King of England returned to London with all his boasting quelled in public derision ; and in the meantime the Puritan leaders made no effort to conceal the fact that they were negotiating with commissioners from Scotland . The leaders of these conventions let it be known that the King was discredited in all parts of his kingdom . In the last extremity of autocratic power , Charles was reduced to what he had irretrievably made the indignity of summoning Parliament once more . Not to do this was to be left utterly impotent in his own country ; to do it was to sanction his own destruction . In November 164o the Long Parliament met at Westminster . It was to survive unexampled passions and crises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG PARLIAMENT . THE REPRESENTATIVE PURITAN WHAT happened during this period was that a King , his chief Minister of State , and the head of his Church , were brought to the scaffold ; that the blood of many thousands of eminent and obscure Englishmen was spilt in the midst of English fields that are familiarly and lovingly known to us all to-day , often with son met against father , and brother against brother ; and that the theory of government in England was with tragic severity revised to the account of all coming generations . But the way in which these things happened is a tale of infinitely complex policy and action . The events upon which history generalises , sometimes significantly and sometimes not , were composed of innumerable and intimate particulars that are now and for ever beyond particularisation . In those years , every town and hamlet and acre knew its own version of a conflict that made the remotest bridle path a likely place of ambush . Out of the vortex certain cardinal results emerged as III OLIVER CROMWELL memorable , but the chronicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for investigation . Our business is to attempt such a summary as will best exhibit Oliver 's character . ? There are in this respect two considerations of the highest importance to be borne in mind . The first is that Oliver Cromwell was , in a very special sense , the product of his age , a Representative Man . His was no remote and lonely genius , patiently bringing to maturity the fruits of its own speculation , satisfied in the pursuit of truth that others might or might not see . Nor was his career inspired by the personal desire for eminence , the zest for directing vast energies with reference to no particular purpose , the joy of subjecting empires to his power and caprice . He was neither poet nor adventurer . In his public life , by which he is remembered , while he gave official employment to Milton , whom he revered , he was as incapable of emulating Milton 's sublime detachments , as he was of sharing such restless ambitions as those that made and broke Napoleon , who he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific necessities at a specific time . He did not make the Puritan revolution , but was its most significant expression . He used no ingenuity to contrive the conditions under which he came into the world 's notice , but was II2 THE LONG PARLIAMENT himself an effect of those conditions as he was in the end their chief instrument . If Charles and Wentworth and Laud had been able and willing to compromise with the spirit that they so continually incited to revolt , it is almost certain that Cromwell would have remained an obscure farmer taking an inconspicuous place in public affairs . It was only when the principles for which he stood as the private member of a party were in the last extremity of danger , that he began to assert his unequalled powers of leadership . For unequalled , in the sense that they knew no reverses , they were . At the assembling of the Long Parliament he was a man of forty , with no more experience of statesmanship than had been afforded by three brief sessions at Westminster in the political ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management of a few farm hands , a small estate , and his colleagues on local committees , and with no practical knowledge whatever of arms . Within less than ten years he had.translated the conscience of a people into terms of terrible but disciplined authority , was directing the national diplomacy , and had led an army of his own making through a succession of desperate campaigns without once suffering defeat . All this he accomplished directly as the representative Puritan . It is , therefore , impossible to disso- // ciate him at any moment of his story from the beliefs and , passions and circumstances upon which Puritanism was founded . It was in the personal example of Cromwell that the movement achieved its most coherent mastery , but without the movement Cromwell could have had no meaning . It is for this reason that , although in 164o he had done nothing to suggest his coming ascendency , it has been necessary to trace with some care the progress of events in which he was but a subordinate agent . The development of Puritanism up to 164o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of other undistinguished citizens , though as it happened in his case with signal consequences . We can only realise the essential features of his earlier years by realising the conditions under which he matured and the aspirations that he was taught to cherish . Our very limited knowledge of his personal life at Huntingdon and St. Ives and Ely , leaves us none the less certain as to the kind of man he was when he first began to be a noted public influence . We know clearly the Puritan temper and faith , and the occasions by which they had been tested , and knowing them we know Cromwell as he was when he came up to London for the second time as member for Cambridge . The other consideration to be remembered // always in approaching Cromwell , is that first and last he was a man of action . Capable as he was of deep intellectual reserve , hungry for lonely communings of the spirit , and often weary of the conflict that gave him no respite , his life , once he had forsaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incessant doing . Violent and incalculable political crises , necessitating ever fresh improvisation and renewed tenacity , in themselves kept the string sufficiently taut . But Cromwell was not only a chief participator in these ; he conceived a new army model , turned recruiting officer , raised one of the most efficient fighting forces known to military history , made himself a master of strategy and tactics , and himself fought in command from one victorious field to another . Utterly insensible to the appeal of conquest for its own sake , and profoundly inspired by an ideal , he was yet called upon to vindicate it in years of unremitting action . It is by action , at Westminster , under arms , in council , and finally as the executive head of the state , that the whole definition of his character is governed . To remember this is important for this reason . No man is in his action infallibly consistent , logical , prudent . The creative processes of art and philosophy are such that by them a man may hope to give nothing of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can labour , often with success , to keep his imperfections out of the work by which he is revealed to us . It is a poor curiosity that asks whether the artist in his life is better or worse than his fellows ; the more so as in any case we may be sure that he is neither . All that we need to know is that he is allowed , for his comfort and ours , to purge some part of himself of its grossness and save it from mortality . No great artist may hope to equal the perfection of his own art , and it is his happy fortune that by his art he is known . When , however , a man with the arresting quality of genius , expresses himself not in art but in action , he invites and has to endure a much more intimate scrutiny . His whole life is put forward for our analysis , and no life can survive that ordeal with an unblemished account . The man of action can effect no concealments , make no perfect abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not merely by his good and great and generous ones , and some will inevitably do his reputation no good . It is true that sometimes our interest is confined to the action of such a man in a limited range , as in the case of the soldier or sailor whose martial exploits alone are of any interest to the world . But when the man of action comes prominently into national affairs , and influences policy as I16 THE LONG PARLIAMENT well as the fortunes of the field , he has to abide the larger audit . And Cromwell , more perhaps than any other figure in our history , is subject to this most searching of all standards . He was a man phenomenally engaged in action , and since he was a presiding force not merely in policy , but in the spiritual and domestic life of a nation critically beset , no phase or turn of that action can escape attention . We shall find that Cromwell sometimes did things that it would be difficult to defend , if it were our place to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but things that lend some colour to his own protestations of insufficiency . And what then ? We do not find in Cromwell the man who , alone among men , had no cause to ask to be forgiven his trespasses . We merely find in him a man who on the whole did more memorably great and beneficent things for his country , who was better able to bear the burden of his acknowledged and not inconsiderable trespasses , than any other Englishman who has proved his faith in his deeds .

THE GRAND REMONSTRANCE ON April Ilth , 1640 , the royalist John Eve-lyn wrote in his diary , " I went to London to see the solemnity of his Majesty 's riding through the city in state to the Short Parlia-ment , which began the 13th following ? a very glorious and magnificent sight . The King cir-cled with his royal diadem and the affections of his people . . . . Upon May the 5th follow-ing , was the Parliament unhappily dissolved . " Seven months later , on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was his practice ) , " I saw his Majesty , coming from his Northern expedition , ride in pomp and a kind of ovation , with all the marks of a happy peace , restored to the affections of his people , being conducted through London with a most splen-did cavalcade ; and on the 3rd November fol-lowing ( a day never to be mentioned without a curse ) to that long ungrateful , foolish , and fatal Parliament , the beginning of all our sor-row for twenty years after , and the period of I2I OLIVER CROMWELL the most unhappy monarch in the world . " How sincerely , how tragically , do the words of the gentle diarist drift down to us from those times . How eagerly could we have pressed with him to see the splendid cavalcade , if that had been all . And how tarnished and ashen does that splendour seem when we know more than Evelyn wished to know . A fatal Parliament indeed , if the word means charged with fate . But the splendour of that cavalcade could not co-exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And let us be clear as to what the splendour really was . It is part of the technique of anti-Puritan writers to represent the cavaliers as standing , with all their faults , for a liberal and cultured way of life against the darkness of fanaticism . It may be remarked that no rational being would for a moment tolerate the mouthing bigots who , by the report of these enthusiasts , were the progenitors of English Puritanism . One concrete example may serve to illuminate the common confusion . It is asked by the cavaliers , how can a liberal modern mind protest in the name of a party that opposed Laud 's very enlightened introduction ? or re-introduction ? of the measure sanctioning , or indeed enjoining , Sunday sports ? The answer is to be found in the actual terms of the proclamation , which do not always seem to have I22 EXECUTION OF STRAFFORD been consulted . There is revealed the fact that only such people were enjoined , or even al-lowed , to take these pleasures of a Sunday , as had attended divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference . Cromwell seems to have come into no prom inence during the first months of the Long Par liament . At the time of the passing of the Grand Remonstrance , in November 1641 , Clarendon refers to him as being then " little taken notice of . " But there is evidence that he was attending closely to the business of the House , if at present with no great celebrity . A few days after Parliament had met he was put in charge of the petition of John Lilburne , of whose treatment by the Star Chamber we have already heard , and on this occasion he makes a first and graphic appearance in the memoirs of the time . The passage from Sir Philip War-wick 's * journal is well known , but not too well for repetition here : " The first time I ever took notice of Mr. Cromwell . . . I came into the House . . . and perceived a gentleman speak ing , whom I knew not , very ordinarily appar elled ; for it was a plain cloth suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country-tailor ; his linen was plain , and not very clean ; I23 OLIVER CROMWELL and I remember a speck or two of blood upon his little band , which was not much larger than his collar . . . . His stature was of a good size ; his sword stuck close to his side ; his countenance swoln and reddish , his voice sharp and untuneable , and his eloquence full of fervour . For the subject matter would not bear much of reason ; it being on behalf of a servant of Mr. Prynne 's Lilburne who had dispensed libels ; I sincerely profess , it lessened much my reverence unto that Great Council , for this gentleman was very much hearkened unto . " It was the hearkening unto these homespun , argumentative , ignorant gentlemen that had for so long been distasteful to Wentworth , now Lord Strafford . So distasteful , indeed , that for years he had persuaded his master not to hearken unto them at all , and with cold and uniform insolence had let it be known that he did not consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance to anybody . Their part was a becoming docility towards their betters who knew the arts of government . Wentworth had done a very bad job with considerable efficiency . His vision was fatally narrow in that it wholly disregarded the rising spirit of the age , but within that vision he worked shrewdly , disinterestedly , and with uncommon application . Apart from his fundamental misconcep-I24 EXECUTION OF STRAFFORD tions , what he designed he was in general able to carry out . So that while men had hated and despised Buckingham , they hated and feared Strafford . So long as it was possible to ignore the gathering storm , he could deceive the Court and himself that they were equal to all emergencies . But now the storm had broken . These loutish fellows from the country , with untuneable voices and no administrative qualifications , had thrust themselves again into the places of authority . And the first measure to which they 2 Jdressed themselves , after some ecclesiastical skirmishing , was the impeachment of the man who had defied them and repudiated the claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal ground had to be shifted before the Commons accomplished their purpose , and a Bill of Attainder against Strafford was substituted for the process of impeachment by law . The attack was determined , but Strafford defended himself with great courage and resource , and had not the mood of the Commons been stiffened in the closing stages of the trial by the discovery of the Army Plot , it is possible that he would have escaped . When , however , it was found that Charles was intriguing with certain army leaders to rescue Strafford and place him at the head of a military rising I25 OLIVER CROMWELL against Parliament , Pym and his colleagues pushed on the Bill with irresistible energy . On May 8th , 1641 , it was forced through the Lords . For two days the King , in an agony of inde cision , withheld the royal assent , while popular clamour round the palace demanded retribu tion . It is pleaded in Charles 's behalf that his position was one of extreme difficulty and dan ger . It was . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could tell what the consequences might be if Charles refused to sacrifice the man who had at least been mag nificently loyal to him . He dared not face the risk , and late on Sunday evening , May 9th , he signed his friend 's death warrant . On May 12th , Strafford was executed on Tower Hill , within a few yards of the cell where Arch-bishop Laud was already waiting against the day four years later when he should be led out , a brave foolish old man , to meet a similar fate with no less intrepidity . At the time of Strafford 's death Charles was compelled to accept a further drastic limitation of his powers . A Bill was passed whereby Par liament could not henceforward be dissolved without its own consent , and became law . Thus with his only capable Minister of State gone , with his most effective ecclesiastical adviser out of reach , and his control over Parliament an-I26 EXECUTION OF STRAFFORD nulled , there was nothing left for him but to seize any chance opportunities that occasion might offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to embarrass the Puritan party itself . Once Laud 's power was curtailed , the nonconformist sects found themselves occupied with distracting differences of their own . By concentrating attention on these , Charles might look for a rally of royalist and High Church forces that would enable him to hold his own yet . It was a forlorn expedient , but there was no other left . The Parliament leaders were by now in constant communication with the Scotch presbyterians . In August Charles went north again , to see what crumbs of comfort he also might pick up in that quarter , leaving the Puritans in daily debate at Westminster , united in a common offensive on Bishops , divided on a dozen problems of Church establishment and government . Cromwell and Vane were responsible for the introduction of a bill for the total abolition of episcopacy ? the Root-and-Branch . When asked what he would put in the place of bishops , Cromwell replied that he was not sure what he wanted , but he knew what could no longer be endured . The King 's departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call for harmony reasserted itself , and the Bill was dropped . In Sep- // tember the House went into recess , and for six weeks Cromwell was back at Ely again . On October 2oth Parliament re-assembled , and learnt that Charles had found a few crumbs . The Scots were not , it seemed , too satisfied with the promises of their new friends at Westminster , and some of them were inclined to negotiate again with a king who was at all times ready to promise anything . Also news came of a Catholic insurrection in Ireland , in which some thousands of Protestants were massacred . Charles issued another of his manifestos , admonishing the Lords not to encourage the Commons in any tampering with Church discipline , and numbers of Episcopalian sympathisers who had hitherto been politically neutral , openly declared themselves Royalist . Alarmed by all these symptoms of a decline in their newly won privileges , the Commons decided to make another demonstration of popular rights , and in November the Grand Remonstrance was laid before the House . In it were recited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament to English liberty , and proposals for lasting reform . The instrument was an elaboration of the Petition of Right , supported by an immensely increased authority . But its passage through the House was by no means easy , a further indication that I28 EXECUTION OF STRAFFORD the King was recovering lost ground . Strafford had been condemned in May by two hundred and four votes to fifty-nine ; it was only after desperate advocacy that in November the Grand Remonstrance was passed by one hundred and fifty-nine votes to one hundred and forty-eight . The scene was one of the most violent ever witnessed in the House , and as it closed , Cromwell is reported by Clarendon to have said to Falkland , " If the Remonstrance had been rejected , I would have sold all that I have to-morrow morning , and never have seen England more ; and I know that there are many other honest men of the same resolution . " Upon which Clarendon observes , " So near was the poor Kingdom at that time to its deliverance . " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , Charles returned from Scotland , and the Remonstrance was presented to him . He took such stock as he could of public feeling , and the result , in the City especially , was not too discouraging . He affected to treat the Remonstrance as negligible , and started clandestine shufflings with the defences of London . Thoroughly alarmed , Parliament sought to strengthen its hand by ejecting the Bishops from the Lords , and succeeded in getting thirteen of them impeached and locked up . It was rumoured that the next mark of Puritan attack // was to be no less a person than the Queen , who not without reason was suspected of regarding the tragic plight of her Protestant subjects in Ireland with some satisfaction , and of tampering with the army . Charles retaliated by an act of stark folly . On January 3rd , 1642 , the Attorney General rose in the House at his bidding , and named five members , Pym , Hampden , Hazlerigg , Holies and Strode , on a charge of high treason . The general stupefaction deepened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an unwarrantable delay in getting forward with the business , sent his Sergeant-atArm to arrest the accused members . Lords and Commons alike sent an indignant protest to Whitehall against this frantic proceeding . Whereupon Charles became more frantic still , and the next day rode down in his coach to Westminster at the head of four hundred soldiers to effect the arrest himself . His men were not there , and he walked out of a House ringing with cries of " Privilege . " And even as he was leaving he had the sublime audacity to " assure them , " as Clarendon tells us , " in the word of a King , that he never intended any force , but would proceed against them in a fair and legal way . " A week later he had left London , and preparations for the Civil War had begun . 13o XII THE FIRST CIVIL WAR . EDGEHILL . THE EASTERN ASSOCIATION XII THE FIRST CIVIL WAR . EDGEHILL . THE EASTERN ASSOCIATION THROUGH a lo'ng term of years the issues upon which the war was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . The distribution of forces was a slow and incalculable process ; the nearest ties of kinship were broken , and discord was set between interests that had worked together for generations . Often during the struggle , as is the case in every war , the aims of both parties became confused , and sometimes demoralised . Narrow-minded pedants , ignorant coxcombs , quacks , canteen sharpers , political dodgers , place-seekers and time servers , were plentiful on both sides . But we have not to judge the Royalist and Puritan causes by their disreputable elements . For the King , as against him , were many thousands of staunch , chivalrous , and incorruptible men drawn from all classes . It was because the Puritans laboured the more exactingly to encourage and discipline their finer qualities and to purify their morale , that they in the end drove their // no less gallant but far less resolute enemies from the field . Roughly speaking , the King 's army and supporters consisted of those sections of the nobility and gentry that were not politically minded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their estates ; members of the Episcopalian Church ; Catholics who hoped , in any new settlement that should follow the King 's victory , for many favours by the influence of Henrietta Maria ; certain vested interests of office ; and a considerable train of freelance adventurers who had no particular principles , but had learnt in Continental wars and elsewhere a code of honour that made them trustworthy enough once their allegiance had been given . The purposes for which this somewhat invertebrate association fought were the establishment of the theory of divine right , of the King 's absolute control over the machinery of government , and of the arbitrary subjection of all political and religious opinion to the person of the Crown and the courts of the State Church respectively . The Puritan party consisted of a majority in both houses of Parliament ; the chief influences in the City , which meant most of the traders throughout the country ; such of the nobility as had been convinced by recent experience of public affairs that the freedom of the average citizen was their free- // dom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the professional classes outside Crown employment ; the squirearchy almost to a man and by far the greater part of the artisans and yeomen . They stood for political rights of the people expressed through Parliament , and for liberty of opinion in religion . Often in the heat of conflict they betrayed their own faith , but this faith it was that was the mainspring of their action , and that they finally vindicated as an enduring principle of English life . When the King fled from London , Parliament at once proceeded to organise its forces for the field . Already in February it is the " Commonwealth " to which " Mr. Cromwell offers to lend three hundred pounds " for such measures of defence or offence as may seem necessary . Hampden 's contribution on this occasion is a thousand pounds . In July , Cromwell is raising two volunteer companies in Cambridge , and lends another hundred pounds to that end . A month later he has seized the Magazine in the castle of that town , and stopped some twenty thousand pounds worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's uses . The parliamentary army is placed under the command of the Earl of Essex , whose general of horse , the new Earl of Bedford , is appointing many captains of troops ; in September // Oliver Cromwell is given such a commission , his troop being number sixty-seven , and consisting of sixty men . In troop number eight his eldest son is a cornet . In the meantime the King also was assembling his arms . Not just now favouring the neighbourhood of London , he journeyed north again , gathering some momentum as he went . At Hull he was refused entrance to the city by a parliamentarian governor , and there on July 15th the first skirmishing of the war took place . On August 22nd the royal standard was raised at Nottingham , and after two months of manoeuvring on both sides the battle of Edgehill in Warwickshire was fought , October 23rd , 1642 . The result was indecisive . Each army numbered about fourteen thousand men , and each claimed the victory . Cromwell was there with his troop . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late into the action from Stratford-on-Avon with his Buckinghamshire green coats helped to head off one of Rupert 's charges . The Parliament had the advantage in arms and equipment , the King in cavalry . The losses were variously computed , but the total casualties seem to have amounted to not less than four thousand . As night fell upon this calamity that had shaken the pastoral peace of the low-lying midland hills , a Puritan X36 THE FIRST CIVIL WAR trooper lit a fire on Beacon Hill by Burton Dassett , a pre-arranged signal that the King 's progress had been checked . It is said that some shepherds at Ivinghoe saw the distant point of light thirty miles away , and signalled in turn to sentinels at Harrow-on-the-Hill , whence the news was taken by waiting horsemen to London . But of all the men in that battle , none knew better than Cromwell that there was as yet no victory to celebrate . It was then that he told Hampden that if they were to succeed against the quality and courage of the King 's arms they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Puritan manhood . He would have such men alone as would in the name of God discover such a spirit as their enemies had that day shown in the name of the King . Hampden agreed , but with some scepticism . It was a right policy , but practicable ? However , he believed in this cousin of his . Not so long since , a friend had enquired in the House , " Pray , Mr. Hampden , who is that man ? For I see he is on our side by his speaking so warmly to-day . " And according to his biographer , Hampden replied , " That sloven whom you see before you hath no ornament in his speech , but if we should ever come to a breach with the King ? which God forbid ? that sloven will be the greatest man in England . " Now , at the end // of 1642 , after Edgehill , Oliver began to show by unsleeping enterprise , unerring fixity of aim , an inspired sense of vocation , that Hampden 's confidence was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal . All moral considerations apart , Cromwell 's achievement of this purpose is one of the romantic wonders of history . Nothing more stirring is to be found in the legendary chronicles . County Associations were formed for the raising and training of troops . In the Eastern Association Cromwell , burning with the lessons of Edgehill , at once took a prominent place ; very rapidly the most prominent . He pleaded , exhorted , threatened , prayed , challenged , and rewarded . Also he worked incessantly to learn all he could of military theory and practice . His promotion to a colonelcy widened his authority , and gave him greater scope . In 1643 he was yet again advanced in service , being appointed Governor of the Isle of Ely by Parliament . Throughout this year , while the main movement of the war was going on in the southwest , lower midlands , and north of England , Cromwell was occupied in organising the forces of the Eastern Association , intermittently engaged in outlying actions on a small scale , at Grantham , Stamford , Gainsborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Deputy-Lieutenants , Mayors , and other competent authorities , for pay due to his troops . " I beseech you hasten to supply to us : forget not money . . .. Lay not too much upon the back of a poor gentleman , who desires , without much noise , to lay down his life , and bleed the last drop to serve the Cause and you . I ask not your money for myself : if that were my end and hope , viz. the pay of my place ? I would not open my mouth at this time ? I desire to deny myself ; but others will not be satisfied . Forget not your prayers . Gentlemen , I am yours , Oliver Cromwell . " Sometimes he had to meet the claims of destitute soldiers out of his own pocket . On one occasion he explained that he could do no more , having already laid out between eleven and twelve hundred pounds in thiq way , and " my estate is little . " But in face of all difficulties , he managed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere for discipline , efficiency , equipment , and zeal . He encouraged support from all quarters , providing only that the givers were " honest godly men " ; or women either for the matter of that , there being a touching little letter of his to some nameless chairman or what not of a group of " Young Men and Maids " who desired to subscribe Twelve-score Pounds towards raising a company of musketeers ; he advises that the // money be spent towards a troop of horse instead . In those Lincolnshire skirmishes Cromwell was often in command of the small Puritan forces engaged , and already he was noted for the success that was never once in the coming years to fail his leadership in the field . His discipline was severe ; but easily imposed , since his men were of the same mind as himself . They learnt now by personal contact that the reputation of Mr. Cromwell of Huntingdon and St , Ives and Ely , as a fearless and honest Puritan and a man very hard to beat or brow-beat , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their organisation going with clear vision and a thoroughly firm hand on themselves , they could say with simple confidence , in his words , " There is nothing to be feared but our own sin and sloth . " In September Oliver could write , " I have a lovely company ; you would respect them did you know them . " Throughout 1643 the war followed an indeterminate course , the armies drifting about the shires waiting on each other 's movements and seldom coming to grips , and then , as at Newbury , with inconclusive results . The King made overtures to Parliament , much to the apprehension of the army in which the real Puritan power was now concentrating . Not again un- // til terms could be dictated were terms to be discussed . On an early morning in mid-June , as Rupert and a small parliamentary force fought among the standing corn across the broad unenclosed farmlands known as Chalgrove Field , by the little town of Watlington in Oxfordshire , John Hampden received the wound of which six days later he died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level in the dust those who would rob the people of their liberty . " In December John Pym , ten years older , the greatest parliamentarian statesman that the new order had seen , and a leader whom every Puritan revered , followed Hampden , wasted by disease and worn out by ardours that he could never subdue . His last act was to induce Parliament to sign the Solemn League and Covenant , whereby Presbyterianism was to become the religion of " the three Kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland , " on the understanding that the Scots were to support the parliamentary arms . The consequences of this agreement were later to reverberate in the clash between an Independent army and a Presbyterian House , but at present the new Independents , Cromwell among them , had not advanced beyond the common distrust of Popes and Bishops , and when orders were given that all Laudian and such-like practices in the Church were to be abolished , I41 OLIVER CROMWELL Oliver was all for obeying them . As we have suggested before , the mood had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life when Cromwell would not have been perfectly content to let any man burn as many candles and say as many masses as he wished , if that had been all . But these things went with a policy of which the results were already sufficiently disastrous . When , therefore ; early in 1644 , the incumbent of Ely Cathedral was found to be conducting the proscribed forms , Cromwell as governor of the town sent him a polite but unequivocal note inviting him to desist . This producing no effect , Cromwell took the first opportunity of walking into the cathedral during service with a military guard , and announcing that he was authorised to dismiss the congregation . Having done so , he stood aside to allow a quiet dispersal , and the Reverend Mr. Hitch taking this to be a sign of irresolution , returned to his ritual , whereupon with no irresolution at all Oliver cried out , " Leave off your fooling and come down , Sir . " As Mr. Hitch then decided to do . 142 XIII THE IRONSIDES . MARSTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRONSIDES . MARSTON MOOR AND NASEBY . FIRST CIVIL WAR ENDS THE new year , 1644 , found Cromwell still employed in training his troops under the Eastern Association , adding to their numbers , bettering their condition , and learning with them something of active warfare . All that had been asked of them hitherto they had given without stint , and Cromwell was daily growing more confident that no demands would ever find them wanting . He is now Lieutenant-General , and can tell a Major-General who has suspended a Lieutenant-Colonel for holding religious views that he , the Major-General , did not esteem , that " the State , in choosing men to serve it , takes no notice of their opinions " ; further , that his correspondent should " take heed of being sharp . . . against those to whom you can object little but that they square not with you in every opinion concerning matters of religion . " Here is a sufficient answer to any who may regard the scene in Ely cathedral as nothing but a display of bigotry. // As summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters upon a point in Yorkshire . The Puritans were now in touch with the Scots , who had crossed the border early in the year . At the end of June the city of York , holding out for the King and now invested , was relieved by Rupert at the head of his undefeated cavalry . The besiegers drew off and joined the main parliamentary army at Long Marston , eight miles west of the city . On Tuesday , July 2nd , the Royalists , under William Cavendish , Marquis of Newcastle , now liberated from York , with Rupert in command of the horse , gathered over against them on the moor in the hot morning . Through the day the two armies watched each other , a long dyke between them , preparing their order of battle , the lines flowing and receding in trial formations . In the late afternoon Newcastle decided that there would be no action that day , and withdrew to his coach . But the parliamentary leaders decided otherwise , and at seven o'clock in the evening the assault was delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty thousand of whom were infantry ; the King 's but eighteen thousand , with eleven thousand infantry . Thus on each side the cavalry , on whom in those days the fortune of battle chiefly depended , numbered seven // thousand . The Puritan horsemen were as yet untried in any major action ; Rupert 's had made themselves feared by a succession of dashing exploits that had never yet failed to retrieve the King 's misfortunes in the field . But an unknown factor was here to prove itself for the first time . The Puritan left and centre broke at the first impact , and something like two-thirds of their force was reduced to what threatened to become a rout . But on the right two thousand five hundred men from the Eastern Association under Cromwell withstood every onset of Rupert 's brilliant courage . They did more . Yard by yard they turned defence into attack , and beat Rupert back into the first reverse he had ever known . As the summer night fell the prince was in flight with six thousand of his hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle in the centre . Almost at the moment of defeat Rupert exclaimed in the face of his vanquisher " Ironsides l " and gave a name to English history . By ten o'clock Cromwell had recovered all the lost positions , broken the last efforts at resistance , scattered the King 's army , and ruined his cause forever in the north . " God made them as stubble to our swords . " Cromwell 's men had become veterans in a day . Henceforward the // presence of the Ironsides in the field was an ever mounting terror to all cavalier pretensions . Cromwell 's one purpose now was to secure an absolute ascendency in arms . To this he applied his genius with an energy that swept aside all opposition . Having struck his decisive blow in the north , he looked towards the south and west , where Royalist hopes , though gravely impaired by news of Marston Moor , were still finding encouragement . There he read nothing but inert mismanagement in the Puritan command , and his dissatisfaction with the state of the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Newbury , late in October , Essex from the west and Manchester from the victory that he had done little to gain in the north , contrived by bad strategy and worse tactics ( Essex was not present at the battle ) to lose an opportunity that Cromwell and the other more enterprising leaders were eager to take . At the end of November Cromwell , returning for a brief appearance in the House , formally charged Manchester with neglect and inefficiency . He did not press the case to an issue , fearing to involve the party in fresh personal disputes at a moment when unity was imperative , but the protest had been made and he knew that it could not be unheeded . The outcome was that on December 9th the Self-Denying Ordinance // passed both Houses , Cromwell speaking twice during the debate in support of the measure . By its provision all members of Parliament , Lords and Commons , were to resign their commissions , and the army was to be officered according to the New Model that had come into being under Cromwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way available of clearing out Essex , Manchester , and their like without unfairness to men who after all had not sought positions for which they were unqualified . Incidentally , it involved the dismissal of many able men from the service , Cromwell himself among them , but by general agreement the removal of incompetents from the highest places was worth even that sacrifice . Had this opinion held , the consequences might well have been fatal ; but this was not to be . While the new ordinance was being put into effect , Cromwell was employed on a western expedition , at the successful conclusion of which , in April 1645 , he was preparing to take leave of Fairfax , the new commander-in-chief , at Windsor , when he received orders from the Committee of Both Kingdoms to remain in the field . Parliament in fact had no intention of losing their ablest officer , and were keeping the post of cavalry commander-in-chief open until such time as they could exempt him from // the ordinance without seeming to be conspiring with its originator . In May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking Royalist positions along the Thames country , now back in the Isle of Ely calling in recruits , establishing lines of communication , perfecting his New Model . Fairfax was besieging Oxford , and the King marching about the midlands with nobody knew what objective . Early in June it seemed that he was likely to move against the Eastern Association , and Cromwell at Cambridge joined in proclamations for defence , seeing to it himself that they were duly obeyed . On the 6th , word came that the royal army was at Market Harborough in Leicestershire , fifty miles away , and advancing eastwards . An appeal was sent to Fairfax for help . In response Fairfax left Oxford in pursuit of the King , and through Parliament instructed Cromwell to come westward to meet him . The vacant post was filled , and the Ironsides moved towards their rendezvous . There were six hundred of them , six hundred , that is , of Cromwell 's Own . On June 12th , Fairfax drew up behind the King at the village of Naseby in Northamptonshire . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of the entire Puritan horse , six thou- // sand of them all told . On the morning of the 14th Charles attacked . As at Marston Moor , the Roundheads had a considerable advantage in numbers : eight thousand foot and six thousand horse against three thousand five hundred foot and four thousand horse . But the King 's army , especially in its cavalry , many of whom had seen foreign service , were picked and experienced men , while the Puritans had in their ranks some thousands of raw untrained troops . The New Model had as yet affected but a small part of the army . As at Marston Moor , one wing and the centre broke before the Royalist dash ; and as at Marston Moor one wing , this time the right , stood unshakably under the example of Cromwell and his Ironsides . In three hours these men had once again turned the whole fortune of battle , and the King 's army was scattered in irreparable confusion . He was never again to face his enemies in action . As an offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to exist , but there was still much for the Puritans to do before the last resistance was quelled . For nearly another year Cromwell was engaged in breaking up the remaining opposition in the south-west , and in reducing such cavalier strongholds as Winchester , Bristol and Basing . He did the // work thoroughly , grimly even , but he never allowed severity to become undisciplined . Honourable terms and safe conduct were given when the enemy would accept them , as at Langford House near Salisbury . His storming was terrible , but never delivered until repeated offers of peaceable negotiations had been made . At Winchester , for example , he summoned the castle to surrender , and was denied . He trained his guns , and after one round , sent a second summons , with the same result . He then effected a breach , and the governor thereupon , before the assault , asked for a parley . Cromwell consented , and articles were agreed upon . When the club-men , irregular bands of countrymen armed with clubs professedly as a protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royalist organisation , hovered round his army two or three thousand strong and indulged in what by the modern equivalent would be sniping by civilians , he had three hundred of them arrested , and having scolded them soundly , sent them home . Licence among his own troops he would never tolerate . On one occasion some of his prisoners complained of unlawful plundering . He sent six accused men to trial by court martial . All were found guilty , and one by lot was hanged , the others being handed over to the Royalist Governor of Oxford : who , however , I.52 FIRST CIVIL WAR ENDS sent them back . Occasions for such rigour in his camp were rare , but he did not shrink from them when they arose . Or we may believe that he did indeed shrink from them , for Cromwell adored his soldiers , truly his brothers-in-arms . But shrinking , he steeled himself nevertheless . The servants of God must be not only above fear but above reproach . By the spring of 1646 the last Royalist had been driven from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered at Oxford . The King had already escaped in disguise to the north and placed himself in the hands of the Scots . The young Prince of Wales had left the country . The triumph of the Parliament was complete , and the first civil war was over . 153 XIV THE ARMY AND THE PARLIAMENT AND yet the triumph was not the Parliament 's , but the army 's . In a directly personal sense it was Cromwell 's , for his above all others had been the genius that had given the army its character and power . And already the tension between Parliament and army was becoming acute . After Naseby , Oliver had written to the Speaker of the House , " Honest men served you faithfully in this action . Sir , they are trusty ; I beseech you , in the name of God , not to dis courage them . " Do not , for example , impose a Presbyterian covenant on men who have a conscience against it . After Bristol , he wrote again to the Speaker , " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of whose valour so much mention is made .... It is their joy that they are instruments of God 's glory and their country 's good . . . Presbyteri ans , Independents , all here have the same spirit of faith and prayer . . . pity it is it should be otherwise anywhere . " A pity , that is to say , that Presbyterian busybodies in high places I 57 OLIVER CROMWELL could not take a hint from honest Presbyterian soldiers , and keep their Presbyterianism to themselves . And again , to an acquaintance in Norfolk whose intervention in some local squall he was soliciting , " Sir , this is a quarrelsome age ; and the anger seems to me to be the worse , where the ground is difference of opinion . " The first civil war was over , but this question of opinion had now to be fought out in the coun-cils of the victors . In the dispute , Cromwell 's Independence found a valuable ally in a new son-in-law that he had recently acquired . In April 1645 , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served notably under Oliver at Naseby and elsewhere . He was now thirty-four , and his bride twenty-one . In the middle of this year Cromwell was back at his business in the House . There he watched the rising jealousy between the Commons and the army with growing anxiety and impatience . " Never were the spirits of men more embittered than now , " he exclaims sadly enough in a letter to Fairfax . " Sir , it 's good the heart be fixed against all this . " Then , loyal to his hope after four years of bloody campaigning , " The naked simplicity of Christ . . . will overcome all this . " That , and nothing else ; if men would only re-turn to it . For months the differences smoul-dered at the point of kindling into conflagra-158 ARMY AND PARLIAMENT tion . The Presbyterians in Parliament were backed by the City , which wanted peace for economic reasons , and saw the surest way to this in disbanding the army and patching up some sort of a treaty with the King . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Model they had not to deal with hordes of hired mercenaries or even conscribed soldiers , but with the flower of the thinking youth and middle-aged manhood of the nation , who had taken up arms for a definite purpose . That purpose was liberty , and at present there was no assurance of it . Until there was the army had no intention whatever of being sent home by their obliged and humble servants . And in the background of this confusion flitted the shadowy figure of the fugitive King of England himself . Not that he was in fact fugitive any longer , being a prisoner . When he first placed himself , as he put it , under the protection of the Scots early in 1646 , they had stated their terms . He was to take the Covenant , and return to the throne pledged to the Presbyterian Church for England . This he declined to do , and thereby laid the foundation for the legend of his martyrdom . That Charles would never accept Presbyterianism in place of his own Church is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tated by that loyalty , is not . To have accepted the Scotch proposals would have been a final defiance of the New Model army , and he had had a great deal more than enough of that . Moreover , in spite of all his experience , he could still persuade himself that he was a necessary part of the State , and that if he could only hold his hand long and astutely enough the State would presently come to him cap in hand . He saw , what everyone saw , that the Presbyterians and Independents in England were at dangerous odds , and might at any moment proceed to destroy each other . That , he conceived , would be his opportunity . In the meantime , he would wait with the Scots , and say nothing . A nimble device , but reckoning without his Scots , who grew tired of waiting , and told their friends at Westminster that if arrears of army pay were forthcoming , they , the Scots , would be very happy to part with their uninvited guest . The Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent of Puritan England , accepted the offer , and sent commissioners to pay the money and bring his Majesty back to London . But the New Model had different views . The King , they thought , would be safer in their keeping than in Parliament 's , and on June 3rd , 1647 , one Cornet Joyce visited Holmby House in Northamp-16o ARMY AND PARLIAMENT tonshire , and in the name of the army relieved the commissioners of their royal charge . Presbyterian Westminster was furious , but impotent . A powerful minority of the House , led by Cromwell , supported the army 's action ; was , indeed , by Cromwell 's authority , chiefly responsible for it . The story of the next eighteen months is one of overstrained nerves and passions , tormented by the incurably shifting and shiftless mind of Charles . There is every reason to believe and none to doubt that at this time Cromwell 's one desire was to effect a settlement that should compose all differences , avoid further bloodshed , and restore the Monarchy on a constitutional basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end could only be achieved by a spirit of tolerance in the Presbyters , commonsense in the politicians , and candour in the King . None of these conditions was to be found . The Commons ? the majority of the Commons , that is ? continued to resist the army 's demands for liberty of conscience ; the Home and War Offices , or whatever they then were , persisted in treating the veterans of Marston Moor and Naseby as naughty rabble ; and Charles played out the lamentable farce of supposing that he could hoodwink men of Cromwell 's or any other kind of genius . In August // ? still 1647 ? the smouldering embers broke into flame . The army ordered Parliament to suspend eleven of its members . It further announced the conditions upon which it would accept the King 's government . These were magnificent in temper . Religious opinion was to be unconditionally free , an exception , for reasons that have already been discussed , being made against Romanism . Presbyterianism was to be free , even Episcopalianism , and if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . But magnificent as the proposals were , they were as yet beyond the grasp of English policy . Cromwell and Ireton , who were very practical saints , saw this , and counselled their friends not to assume powers of legislation . Hoping to find yet a way of escape from the threatened rupture , they entered into close negotiations with Charles , seeking to persuade him that by accepting a reformed theory of monarchy he could save himself and his people . The main body of the army viewed these approaches with something like savage suspicion . Their captain , they believed , was betraying them . But the betrayal was not his . While Charles was professing favourable and even grateful consideration of the proposals laid before him by Cromwell and Ireton , he was newly in communication with the Scots and constructing a // plot for the fresh invasion of England from the north . Suddenly the generals learnt the truth , and the King was warned . In November the prisoner slipped by his guard at Hampton Court and made good his escape to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last reckoning . But first the Scotch menace had to be met . In the late spring of 1648 , Ironsides was at the head of his troops again , and the second Civil War had begun . XV THE EXECUTION OF THE KING EVEN in this extremity the King thought that his star was rising . What could be more desirable than that the New Model and their late allies the Scots should thus break or be broken ? The old infatuation had never so tragically overreached itself . Cromwell moving northwards was veritably a fury of the Lord upon earth . At Preston in August he met the invaders , twenty-one thousand in numbers , swarming down from Scotland under the Duke of Hamilton . He had but nine thousand men in his own command . But he and they were ablaze with an apocalyptic wrath , and in a battle that lasted three days they annihilated the King 's last hope . Hamilton fell to utter ruin before a ferocity of attack that has never been excelled in warfare . " Surely , Sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commons , " this is nothing but the hand of God . " And that hand , divine or East Anglian , was now inexorably upon the person of Charles Stuart . In the meantime the Presbyterian members // had been carrying on negotiations of their own with the King at Carisbrooke . They too had found him incapable of even-handed dealing , but clung to the hope of an accommodation as the only alternative to army rule . Whether they succeeded in the project or failed in reality mattered little , since Cromwell and his men were now returning from Preston and the subsequent northern campaign with an authority that was prepared to abide no question . Charles was removed to other quarters under a strong army guard . This was at the end of November . On December 4th , the Presbyterians of the House in desperation proposed that the King 's offers were a sufficient ground of settlement . The debate went on through the night until five o'clock the following morning , when the " Yeas " had it . On the 6th , Thomas Pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , placed musketeers at all the entrances to Westminster with orders to allow no one to enter whose name was on the list that he carried in his hand as he walked in and out of the Hall and kept up a continuous round of inspection . On the evening of that day Cromwell arrived in town , and on the 7th Pride 's Purge was continued . Over a hundred members were excluded ; and the Rump Parliament was left to do the army 's will . X68 EXECUTION OF THE KING Cromwell had sworn that if he returned from the field again it should be to judgment . While he had displayed incomparable military genius , and superb personal heroism , he was in his heart nothing of a soldier and all patriot . The first civil war had been to him a very terrible necessity , and he believed , with sufficient reason , that Charles ' duplicity and nothing else had been responsible for the second . He felt now , and the whole of independent Puritanism together with a large body of Presbyterians in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fatally to imperil everything for which Marston and Naseby and Preston had been fought and won . To us , who can share the passions and dangers of those days only in imagination , to whom the liberties then at stake seem a natural and easy inheritance , the execution of a King appears as an event of tragic horror . But at the time the events necessitating the tragedy were even more shocking . It is difficult for us to hear Cromwell saying , " We will cut off his head with the crown upon it , " without wincing as at a cold brutality ; but unless we overcome the difficulty , we must miss the meaning of Cromwell and Puritanism altogether . We have to realise that the words were said from the white heat of a soul that had struggled out of the toils of a triple betrayal . And // it was not merely Oliver Cromwell 's soul , but England 's . The report of the King 's trial makes lamentable reading . The terrible judgment , we feel , is being delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel also an almost anguished desire somehow to modify the finding of the Court . This may be sentimental , but sentimental impulses are always cutting across men 's affectation of logic . The great crises of history are wrought in passion , and it is as futile to look for logic in the spectators as it is to look for it in the actors themselves . But even the logic in this scene of tremendous passion can not finally be disputed . In a play that I wrote on Cromwell , I make his mother say of the King 's death , " If this be wrong , all was wrong , " and that I think is the inescapable truth . Charles had shown that he could not , or would not , adjust himself to the new conditions of English thought and liberty , and it was plain that he could live only as a constant and dangerous repudiation of those conditions . His death was a solution from which the instinct recoils , but the reason casts about in vain for any other . The trial began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Bradshaw being Lord President of the Court . Charles refused to acknowledge the authority of his judges , and offered no other defence to the // charge of Treason ? " subverting the ancient and fundamental laws and liberties of this nation . " Cromwell attended the sittings , which lasted until the following Saturday , but took no other part in the proceedings . On the 27th sentence of death was pronounced , on the 29th the Warrant was signed by Bradshaw , Thomas Grey , and , third on the list , Oliver Cromwell , and fifty-six others . The next day the sentence was carried out at Whitehall ; Oliver , it is said , witnessing the scene from a window in the palace . To see in this , as detraction had been eager to do , a gross insensibility , is strangely to misapprehend his character . 171 XVI // WHILE , however , the death of the King set the seal , and for ever , upon the principles that had sent the Puritans into many desperate fields , its immediate effect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion . It was not till more than a generation later that the real lessons of the civil war and of the overthrow of despotic monarchy began to emerge clearly from the political , social , and religious welter that marked the Commonwealth and the reigns of the later Stuarts . Never has the din of sects and factions risen in shriller confusion than it did in the ' fifties of seventeenth-century Britain , and of those old and bitter quarrels it is chiefly the confusion that has survived . Our loss is trifling . In the twenty years between 1629 and 1649 the character of our country made one of those manifestations that are a story for ever . In those years the objects for which men strove were defined with a black-and-white precision . But once that clean-cut issue had been decided , the disputants fell into an infinite vari- // ety of vain and petty brawls . Up to the date of the King 's execution the contest had been between heroes ; men of the Shakespearean stature , whether for good or evil intent . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it fell into a squabble between fishwives . Our interest is only with the emphasis that the chaos of settlement gave to the nature of the man who had made the settlement possible . It is , perhaps , a rash conclusion , but we believe that Cromwell in his secret reflections knew that in 1649 his real work had been accomplished . It would , he must have believed , take more years than he would see to bring the nation to serene enjoyment of the privileges for which he had fought . He may even have suspected that his desires would finally be realised in conditions quite alien to those of his present moulding . On the death of the King , monarchy was abolished by Parliament in terms that were intended to establish the new order in permanence , but it is not unlikely that even then Cromwell saw the shadow of the restoration as he certainly saw it before his death less than ten years later . One thing , however , was sure in the midst of these or other doubts ; a word had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England firmly in control of popular rights 176 // against any tyranny . How soon or how late could not at the moment be told , but the consummation was from that moment inevitable , and Cromwell knew it . In the meantime , he had little leisure for speculation . For the rest of his life he was engaged in preserving such unity as he could in a great national party that after a supreme effort had fallen exhausted into a fever of internal discord . In doing this he displayed infirmities to which he freely confessed . When he spoke of his burden as too great to be borne and of himself as a poor worm , the words were no lip-service to an occasion , but the cries of a passionate and suffering spirit deeply toiled in circumstance . History down to our own time is rich in examples of the spectacle . A man leads his people up to and through a crisis with superb vision and heroism , and when the achievement comes later to be organised on the ebb of the consuming impulse he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind . It was so with Cromwell . Up to 1649 there is little in his career that does not wholly compel our admiration . He was now fifty years of age . He had throughout his manhood been steadfast in mind and speech to the most liberal form of Puritan doctrine ; he had given his cause authority by fearless example and by military // genius of a unique character ; and he had been chiefly responsible for the vindication of English freedom in a victory that , however ruthless it may have been , was nobly disinterested . At this point he stands before us , the patriot without blemish ; the subtlest and most intelligent patriot , perhaps , by whom the action of English history has been dignified . The nine years that he had yet to live brought him to yet greater world eminence , but they belonged essentially to an occasion of diminished splendour , and they betrayed him into lapses that we recognise without presuming to blame . His immense capacity for statesmanship was , indeed , fully tried only in these later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and invention as a leader of men . The successes of his government at home and abroad were largely his personal successes , and they afforded constant proof that he was immeasurably the ablest administrator in the country at the time . Nor were the native qualities of his heart ever seriously obscured . Vexed in soul as he often was , he continued always to care above all for the well-being of England , which for him meant the individual liberty and enlightenment of the English people . But once the meridian of effort had been passed , and inspiration had to be tested in endless details of policy and interest , the trouble 178 // was that even he could not always see how that well-being was to be effected . And sometimes he chose questionable means for his purpose . Once or twice he allowed his perplexity to betray him into actions that may be explained but which even affection does not seek to excuse . The Puritan Revolution was an event infinitely valuable to the life of all coming generations in England ; but also it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this violence that Cromwell 's government of England was founded . Here was a condition for which the price had inevitably to be paid . Cromwell and his men stood for right as clearly as any party has ever stood in this country , but they held power without legal sanction , and were in consequence subject to a formal insecurity that no moral justification could remove . They might , and indeed did , make their own legal sanction , but it was bound to be hotly disputed at every step , and utterly denied by a large body of opinion . The execution of Charles may have been necessary and just , but no ingenuity could make it lawful . It was , in fact , contrived by a minority assembly at the orders of a dominant army . That army was , we know , composed of the best that England then could very proudly boast , but it literally took the law into its own hands , with results that were a daily menace to the Common- ' 79 OLIVER CROMWELL wealth and Oliver 's Protectorate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not deny that Cromwell was the usurper that he was so bitterly styled . And the usurper , however sure his claims may be by equity and reason and the common good , has discarded peace of mind for ever . Inescapably he is drawn into the way of despotism , and step by step , in his dealings with Parliament , with the army , and with national policy , Cromwell became as despotic as the monarchy that he had destroyed . Between the two despotisms there was a vital difference . Charles 's despotism was leading the nation into captivity , Cromwell 's was the prelude to the deliverance for which he had fought but for which he could not yet discover the practical formula . But despotism , no matter how benevolent it may be , is inseparable from excesses , and of such excesses Cromwell 's rule can not be absolved . We may , however , ask that they should be kept duly in perspective . Few despots of Oliver 's power and circumstance have so little need to ask the indulgence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's death the government passed into the hands of a Council of State , of which Cromwell was a member and the first President . There was , however , urgent business to be dealt with outside the council chamber , and almost at once Oliver was back with the army , leaving the Presidency to Bradshaw . Two matters of high importance claimed his attention . Foremost of these was a Royalist movement in Ireland . But before this could be arrested , it was necessary to see that the discipline and temper of the army had not fallen out of repair during the months of inactivity . Disorder of a very formidable kind was immediately apparent . Numbers of men who had fought with pure zeal for Puritanism fondly believed that with the new government would be inaugurated their veritable kingdom of heaven on earth . They had risked all for freedom , and now freedom , absolute and elysian , should surely be their reward . This had been a war for the establish- // ment of the perfect state , with every man unhindered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and yet here were army leaders still enforcing discipline and soldierstatesmen suggesting that there was a long and rough road to travel yet . Brave men , but refusing to realise that the millennium was no more within their grasp than the moon . The Levellers preached to their comrades in the ranks that nothing now stood between them and Utopia but the self-esteem of a few jacks-in-office . In short , they were openly inciting to mutiny , and Cromwell found himself for the first time in the tragically false position that is so often the fate of practical evangelists . He , the heart and right arm of liberty 's cause in England , was now called upon to correct men whose demand was for nothing but freedom and yet more freedom . The claimants were not loosely aiming at mere license ; they sincerely believed that the material and spiritual worlds could there and then be parcelled out in terms of liberty , equality , and fraternity . In demonstration of their theories they annexed certain lands at Cobham in Surrey , started community agriculture , proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighbouring park and appropriating the enclosures , and promised anyone who would join them the current equivalent of // three acres and a cow . Cromwell may very well have sympathised with their ambitions . But he was in command of an army that was under orders for duty across the Irish Channel , and it was in this army that the Levellers were most active . At such a moment there was no room in his nature for philosophic doubt . Either he must act strongly or resign from public office . Warnings and entreaties were of no avail . The levelling ringleaders persisted in their propaganda , and suddenly the unpractical saints found themselves sharply in conflict with the saint who was disconcertingly practical . A few swift descents on the scenes of disaffection were followed by the processes of court-martial , and firing-parties did their lamentable work in the full gaze of London traffic at St. Paul 's and in the seclusion of a country churchyard at Burford in Oxfordshire . As the executed body of a young trooper named Lockyer , who at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , was carried away from St. Paul 's for burial , a great crowd followed the coffin through the London streets , deeply shaken with emotion but in an orderly silence broken only by the sound of " six trumpets sounding a soldier 's knell . " But Cromwell needed no such spectacle to convince him how dreadful the occasion was . Perceiving that something must be // done , he believed also that the only merciful svay was to do it decisively . The pretensions of the Levellers as he saw them were in no sense ignoble ; but as things were they meant anarchy in the State and ruin to the country . There was nothing for it but to crush them , and for this the two relentless strokes of St. Paul 's and Burford sufficed . Under those terrible examples , Cromwell persuaded the malcontents to mend their ways ; and he persuaded them with an eloquence that rose above intimidation . They could face the rifles of a firing-squad without flinching , but when old Ironsides of Marston and Naseby stood before them pleading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthreatening appeal . The smoking barrels were indeed an earnest of his inflexible will , but that alone could not have won them . It was when they realised that the man who had never failed them in battle was still of an uncorruptible spirit that they succumbed . Cromwell 's army was whole again . But he had been driven to his first act of despotism ; for it was something more than a military insurrection that he had suppressed . Cromwell 's Irish campaign is the dark shadow upon his fame ; with what justice we shall enquire . History has a two-fold function : to collect facts , and to interpret them . The his- // torian who confines himself to the accurate assembling of data is our creditor even though he resolutely refrains from offering any observations upon the material that he arranges . He is readily dubbed dryasdust by writers who are willing enough to borrow from his archives , perhaps without acknowledgment , but he is in reality often an honour to scholarship and greatly facilitates our understanding of mankind . But the historian who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible figures of humanity has a definite responsibility , which too often he ignores . If beyond recording an event he seeks to invest it with motive and character , it is his duty to do so in terms that do not violate a common knowledge of human nature . In my book about Charles II , I suggested that the usual interpretation of his treatment of Montrose was not plausible in the light of psychology or common sense . Critics who in their moral prejudice are prepared to believe any ill of Charles , accept without question the view that he abandoned a loyal gallant servant in a mood of craven and cynical treachery . I showed that , having due regard for the circumstances and Charles 's character in all its aspects , this was a view that made no sense . My explanation of the affair may or may not have been the true one , but at least it squared the actors in the drama // with some possible code of conduct based on experience of men and their ways . And so with Cromwell in Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been forgotten . It is not our business to excuse or palliate them . But it is our business to see as exactly as we can how and why he came to do them , and not to accept the fulminations inspired by a general prejudice against a Cromwell in effigy bearing no resemblance to the original . When we hear that drunk with power and pride of place Oliver abandoned himself in Ireland to a frenzy of hideous brutality , deranged at last in an unbridled lust for destruction , we know that animosity has lost control of itself . And yet , if we refuse this explanation , we have to find another . For Cromwell 's severities in Ireland were , and are , staggering , and some explanation is needed . Our only clue to the right one must , as always , be a consideration of his character in relation to the known circumstances . We have seen the temper in which Cromwell approached his northern campaign when he learnt that Charles was keeping faith at no step in the negotiations between them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make any further appeal to the sword impossible , and he had carried the task through implacably to the scaffold at Whitehall . // There remained before him the further and infinitely difficult task of reconstruction . To that he was now preparing to devote all his energies , addressing himself to problems that might have daunted any man , and with one sole assurance to support him , that the final trial by battle had been made . And at that moment news came from Ireland that a dozen contending factions had been composed by the unwearying policy of the Marquis of Ormond into a new and formidable Royalist army . Catholics , Episcopalians , covenanting Presbyterians , refugee Cavaliers , Parliament troops quartered in Ireland but with no very strong affections for Parliament in these later days and susceptible to the prestige of Ormond , stragglers from the defeated Scots army , and Protestant colonists who distrusted the upstart Commonwealth even more than they did their Catholic neighbours , all these suddenly became reconciled at Ormond 's bidding into a compact and very formidable front . Very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , the young Charles in exile was debating whether he should join the Ormondites in Ireland or the Covenanters in Scotland , and extensive preparations were forward for a further challenge at arms in the King 's name . The effect of this intelligence on Cromwell // can readily be imagined . Always a resolute fighter , his resolution was now stung to fury , and he turned upon Ireland in avenging wrath . On March 1sth , 1649 , he was made Commander of the Irish Forces and Lord Lieutenant ; on the same day Milton was appointed Latin Secretary to the Council of State . We get glimpses of Oliver 's domestic concerns while he is preparing for Ireland . He marries his son Richard , the future Protector , to Dorothy Mayor , conducting a scrupulous correspondence with " my very loving brother Richard Mayor , Esquire , at Hursley " about the marriage settlement , complaining that his loving brother is being rather close : " I received your Paper ... I desire your leave to return my dissatisfaction therewith .. . I have two young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity . According to your offer , I have nothing for them ; nothing at all in hand . " An amicable agreement was made , however , and towards the end of July he writes from Bristol to Hursley that he is " very glad to hear that our children have so good leisure to make a journey to eat cherries , " adding that he is expecting his wife at Bristol and that she will doubtless call on them by the way . In August he was at Milford Haven , and on the 13th sailed for Ireland , arriving at Dublin two days later . // He was in the country nine months , and when he left in May r65o , his son-in-law Ireton , who succeeded him in command , had only isolated risings in remote parts of the west to deal with , Ormond 's main forces having been destroyed . The succession of events in this military campaign need not be given here , adding as for the most part they do nothing to our knowledge of Cromwell . After October 1649 , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disease in Cromwell 's ranks being neutralised by desertion from Ormond 's , until Cromwell 's superior discipline and generalship wore down the last opposition . But before that date Drogheda and Wexford had been stormed , and it is by Drogheda and Wexford that Cromwell 's conduct in Ireland has been measured . The facts may be stated briefly . On his arrival at Dublin Cromwell at once issued a proclamation imposing the strictest restraint on his troops in their dealings with the civil population , defining very exactly the offences for which they would be answerable . As though already conscious of the extreme rigours to which he was shortly to put the interpretation of martial law , he spared no pains at the outset to let it be known precisely what that law forbade . This was on August 24th , 1649 . A week later , " after some refreshment taken for // our weather-beaten men and horses , " he was at Drogheda ( Tredah in those times ) some thirty miles north of Dublin . It was a stronghold of great strategic importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its reduction was a capital necessity to Cromwell 's designs , and as his army lay before it on September 2nd his determination burnt in a steady incandescence . He took a week to " frame his batteries , " and on the 9th they began to play . Simultaneously , he sent a summons to the Governor requiring him to " deliver the Town to the use of the Parliament of England , " with an offer of safe conduct to the garrison . No satisfaction being returned , the bombardment proceeded . On the loth the storm was made , and was repulsed with heavy loss . This was not to be endured . Rallying his men , Cromwell , Lieutenant General , Lord-lieutenant , Commander-in-chief , and what not besides , placed himself at their head and in person led a second assault . This time the breach was entered , and as defence by defence was broken the defendants were slain without quarter . Nearly three thousand of them perished . There is no doubt that in the chaos of that slaughter a number of civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is no reliable evidence to show that this was with // Cromwell 's sanction or by any deliberation . The ethics of civilian immunity in warfare , so drastically tested in our own time , were in any case an inconsiderable element in the sack of Drogheda , It is enough that the garrison was annihilated . The town was in Cromwell 's hands , and it would not have been the less so had he shown mercy . He showed none . It does not make pretty reading , but we have yet to learn from any page of history that the invasion of a country has ever been a pretty business . Mildness was no part of Cromwell 's soldiering , and he was convinced that never could mildness be more misguided than now . Ireland was to know that resistance meant ruin , and it was the fate of Drogheda to bear the first tragic witness to the inexorable condition . The garrisons of Dundalk and Trim asked for no further example , and laid down their arms forthwith . Three weeks later Cromwell was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On October 3rd the summons to deliver the town " to the use of the State of England " was made . The Governor asked for time in which to consult with his officers and the Mayor , and for a cessation of hostilities in the meantime . To which Oliver replied , " Sir , I am contented to expect your resolution by twelve of the clock to-morrow morning . Because our tents are not so good a cover- // ing as your houses , and for other reasons , I can not agree to a cessation . I rest , Your servant , Oliver Cromwell . " The next day the Governor proposed a conference , and was told that he was being asked not to negotiate but surrender , but that if he had anything to say he could send his messengers to Cromwell within an hour . A further extension of time was granted , and on the sth the Governor announced that his conditions were drawn up . Cromwell sent a safe-conduct for four envoys . At that moment a relieving force obtained entry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument , and told Cromwell he must wait a little longer . Cromwell instantly withdrew the safe-conduct , and prepared to assault the castle . On the i Ith the batteries opened , and after a hundred shots had been fired " the Governor 's Stomach came down " and he asked for a renewal of the safeconduct , which was given . Two field-officers , an alderman , and the Captain of the Castle , brought out the specified propositions , " which , " says Cromwell in writing to the Speaker of the Commons , " for their abominableness , manifesting also the impudency of these men , I thought fit to present to your view . " The conditions , which need not be enumerated here , amounted to a confirmation of the civic rights of the town to the existing corporation , and leave for such // citizens as chose to depart from the town with their property ; full acknowledgment of the Roman establishment in the town and its franchises ; and permission for the entire garrison with its " artillery , ordnance , ammunition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what else belongs to them " to march under flying colours with a convoy provided by Cromwell to escort them to a destination of their own choosing in Ormond 's country . Cromwell might well see in this an " impudency " seldom equalled . His answer was brief , but still admirable in its moderation . " I have had the patience to peruse your Propositions ; to which I might have returned an Answer with some disdain . But , to be short ? I shall give the Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers quarter for life , and leave to go to their several habitations , with their wearing clothes ; they engaging themselves to live quietly there , and to take up arms no more against the Parliament of England . And the Commissioned Officers quarter for their lives , but to render themselves Prisoners . And as for the Inhabitants , I shall engage myself that no violence shall be offered to their goods , and that I shall protect the Town from plunder . " The letter was not delivered ; while Cromwell was writing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of betrayal in the town gave the besiegers // sudden entry . The scene that followed was none of Cromwell 's ordering ; but he did not disown it . The extremity was by a few hours out of his reckoning , but it was one to which he was prepared to go . Again there is no evidence of violence done outside the severest imposition of military law , apart from the inevitable excesses of individual soldiers ; and again the destruction of the garrison was complete . As to the effect that Drogheda and Wexford had on the future of the Irish campaign each student of history must form his own conclusions . Opinions vary between far extremes . The Cambridge Modern History ( Professor Dunlop ) considers that the violence was useless , " because after the first terror had passed away it did not serve to weaken the resistance of a single garrison . " At the other extreme there is Carlyle 's " that it did save much effusion of blood ' ( Cromwell 's own words ) we and all spectators can very readily testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of the Irish War . . . there was no other storm or slaughter needed in that Country . " Carlyle goes too far , but he is , we think , a good deal nearer the truth than the more recent historian . Stubborn resistance was still offered here and there , but as we read the records of this and of many bloodless capitulations , we are persuaded that it would have been far // more stubborn and far more general if Cromwell had mitigated his first blows . In May 165o , he left Ireland with the famous " Cromwellian Settlement " already well in view . The conditions of the settlement were to be a stormcentre of bitterness and contention for nearly three centuries ; but without them it is by no means unlikely that Great Britain would long since have become a third rate power . The moralities of the matter may be left to anyone who feels competent to pronounce on them ; but that is the fact . On reaching London Cromwell was conducted in triumph through the streets by Parliament , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone exclaimed on the size of the multitude assembled to meet him , and Oliver replied that a much greater would come out any day to see him hanged . // DUNBAR AND WORCESTER THE Scotch War , arising out of circumstances that necessitated Cromwell 's return from Ireland , throws no new light on his character , but touches his military character with its last strong note of genius . The Scotch Covenanters , tired of waiting on the English Parliament for favours that never advanced beyond polite assurances , opened negotiations with the pathetic little court of Charles to be the Second that was dodging about the Continent in search of any alms or hospitality that it could come by . After long hesitation as to whether he should ally himself to the Montrose Royalists or the Covenanting Presbyters , and after vain efforts by Hyde and others to unite those irreconcilables in one cause , Charles at the age of twenty landed in Scotland under the equally distasteful auspices of Argyll 's low cunning and Kirk pedantry . He had already been preached into taking the Covenant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach him out of his five wits . And while they preached Cromwell was crossing the 20I OLIVER CROMWELL border with his Ironsides , in the field again to meet yet another challenge against the England of his dreams . On the way he writes to Richard Mayor , " I should be glad to hear how the little Brat doth . I could chide both Father and Mother for their neglects of me : I knew my son is idle , but I had better thoughts of Doll . I doubt now her husband hath spoiled her ; pray tell her so from me . . . I hope you will discharge my duty and your love ; you see how I am employed . I need pity . I know what I feel . Great place and business in the world is not worth looking after . . . I have not sought these things . " On September 3rd , a year and a day after his fateful appearance before Drogheda , he engaged the army of the Covenant at Dunbar . He had eleven thousand men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployed on chosen ground , and with ample lines of communication , Cromwell 's being cut off . At six o'clock in the morning , hoping to snatch an advantage by not waiting to be attacked , Oliver moved his whole force into action , his word for the day being " The Lord of Hosts . " Within an hour the Puritan arms had achieved one of the most astounding victories known to the chronicles of war . The Scotch army became a total rout , scattered in a pursuit of eight miles . Three thousand were killed , and ten thousand // prisoners were taken , together with the entire baggage and artillery . And then , in Cromwell 's despatch to the Speaker , comes the amazing passage , " I do not believe we have lost twenty men . " It was a long road now that had been covered from the Eastern Association . The Ironsides campaigns were soon to be at an end , Through the winter of 1650-51 Cromwell spent his time and his eloquence attempting to convince the Scots who had fought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of Stuart was a monstrous folly . But , speaking in the name of England , he would have none of their Covenant , and short of that they would listen to no proposals . The establishment of a Presbyterian Church in the Kingdom of Great Britain was too rich a prize to be lost , if it could in any way be secured . The only hope still seemed to be in the restoration of Charles to the throne , and so in spite of Dunbar the Scots laboured with him in sermons and promises . On New Year 's day , 1651 , they crowned him King at Scone , a week after Edinburgh Castle had yielded to Oliver 's persuasions ? very pacific but very determined , with batteries waiting to supplement the argument ? and placed itself in his hands . There Cromwell waits some four months , still arguing and still hoping ; troubled not a little by the exploits of // Moss-troopers , a kind of wilder Scotch equivalent to the English Clubmen ; asking the Army Committee in London that " you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be struck in honour of Dunbar ; accepting the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford , after explaining his many disqualifications for that high honour , and marking the occasion by a request that a doctor who had done well by his troops in Ireland should be given a Degree ; desiring the Commons to extend all friendly consideration to the project for founding a college at Durham , " as that which , by the blessing of God , may much conduce to the promoting of learning and piety in those poor rude and ignorant parts " ; lying at one time in a " fit of sickness " of which he thought to have died ; and exchanging letters of lovely domestic tenderness with his wife ? " I have not much to write : yet indeed I love to write to my Dear , who is very much in my heart . " And Richard , who now at the age of twenty-four , might in these busy times have found , we should have supposed , some worthy employment , " hath , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . " If anyone should doubt the gentleness that lay in the depths of our great Puritan 's heart , let him consider these words of paternal fondness ; they are written to Richard Mayor : " I desire it to be understood // that I grudge him not laudable recreations , nor an honourable carriage of himself in them , . . Truly I can find in my heart to allow him not only a sufficiency but more , for his good ... Truly I love him , he is dear to me ; so is his wife ; and for their sakes so I thus write . They shall not want comfort nor encouragement from me , so far as I may afford it . " And then , with visions of Marston and Naseby and Drogheda and Dunbar before him , " But indeed I can not think I do well to feed a voluptuous humour in my Son , if he should make pleasures the business of his life , in a time when some precious Saints are bleeding , and breathing out their last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nobler for that . In July 1651 the Scotch army , re-organised and nominally commanded by Charles , was again broken by Cromwell , this time at Inverkeithing , and the young prince with such salvage as he could collect resolved on the last desperate expedient of marching into England in the hope that his presence would rally the Royalists there to some effective strength . Cromwell , leaving Monk to do what remained to be done in Scotland , followed at high speed , and on the first anniversary of Dunbar the Ironsides fought their last battle , in the streets of Worcester . The result was decisive , and now // the Kirk and Royalism knew that it was decisive . Charles escaped to France . And to " the Honourable William Lenthall , Esquire , Speaker of the Parliament of England " Cromwell wrote , " It is , for aught I know , a crowning mercy . " We may recall his words to Hampden after Edgehill , now nearly ten years ago . Never , perhaps , has such a boast as they implied been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an army of his own making , had fought innumerable skirmishes and at last six capital actions , had never once been put to terms , and now his soldiering was done . 206 XIX LORD PROTECTOR THE ideals for which Cromwell and his men had for nine years been more or less continuously in the field have , I hope , been made sufficiently clear . Order in the State under regularised parliamentary control , freedom of the subject within the law , and liberty of conscience , were the main issues . They had been now trebly vindicated by the appeal to arms , and Cromwell left his troops for the last time to see that they should be realised in the administration of peace . The difficulty of his task has already been indicated . It had not diminished during his absence in Ireland and Scotland . The Rump of the Long Parliament had slowly subsided into a torpor in which it now drowsed supinely through a time-table of formalities . It was perfectly plain to any candid observer that the government of the country was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the headquarters of Cromwell 's army . Oliver himself could very truly protest that he did not desire this ? " I have not sought these things . " // He was far too clear-headed and clear-souled a patriot to trifle in his mind for a moment with the situation . So long as there were battles still to be won , Parliament could do little but watch and wait , but now that the last battle was over Cromwell knew well enough that there could be no hope of a settlement in the country until the real authority had passed back again from the army to the Commons . The first thing to be done was to replace the quite unrepresentative and now discarded Rump by a full and nationally elected Parlia-ment . For nearly two years after Worcester Cromwell persevered in debate to this end . He was already much worn in body and spirit . " My Lord , " said a friend in Scotland , " is not sensible that he is grown an old man . " But the iron will did not allow his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariness to weariness . The sitting members of the Rump had no mind to do anything , but they had less mind to depart in peace . Their chief pretext for remaining where they were was a Dutch War . Holland had never taken kindly to the new Commonwealth of England ; had indeed refused it any diplomatic respect . It was the army again that took the matter in hand , this time at sea under Blake , but the members at Westminster argued with some plausibility that 210 LORD PROTECTOR they must not be disturbed in their business of securing necessary supplies . In the meantime the progress towards reconstruction was precisely nil . Complaints of every kind poured in from men in all ranks of life with legitimate grievances . They were obligingly placed on the file for reference . Veterans of Marston Moor and Naseby , long versed now in the dual responsibility of praising God and keeping their powder dry , asked with growing impatience if anyone could tell them what they had been fighting for . Cromwell could , but his daily care was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And the Rump slept on , rousing itself at intervals to expound theories of new possible forms of government . On the whole the feeling was " that a Settlement with somewhat of Monarchical power in it would be very effectual . " These were Cromwell 's words ; and rumour , confidently misinformed as usual , whispered that he aimed at making himself King . He did not even trouble to contradict the grossness , but continued in his efforts to galvanise the Rump into enough life to replace itself by a responsible assembly . His public and private affections were darkened at the time by the loss of Ireton , who died of a fever in Ireland at the end of 1651 . Ireton was succeeded by Charles Fleetwood , one of Crom-2I1 OLIVER CROMWELL well 's generals , who later also became his son-in-law , marrying Ireton 's widow , Bridget . Slowly the Rump elaborated a device where-by it should add to its numbers and make itself into a representative assembly without the haz ardous necessity of going to the country . It was speedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any of the Westminster sleepers wanted to keep his bench , he must get himself re-elected . The sleepers began to take serious notice at last . They would not get re-elected . They would stay together , if they pleased , until death did them part ; and , further , they would reserve to themselves the right of rejecting , on grounds of public interest , any newly elected member of whom they did not approve . This went on until April 1653 , when a Bill embodying these provisions was actually before the House , and likely to be passed . Cromwell 's patience was exhausted , and his sense of national danger at length startled into action . After a conference with the army of ficers , his decision was made . On April 2oth , while the Bill was being debated , " the Lord General Cromwell came into the House , clad in plain black clothes and grey worsted stock ings , and sat down , as he was wont to do , in an ordinary place . " The question was put , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver " rose 2I2 LORD PROTECTOR up , put off his hat , and spake . " Never have honourable members been so shocked to hear the truth about themselves . Very wide awake now , one of them expressed deep pain that language so unusual should be heard in those walls , and from an honourable member , too , himself so much respected . A sharp echo as from Ely Cathedral cut him short as Cromwell walked on to the floor of the House exclaiming , " Come , come ! We have had enough of this . I will put an end to your prating . " An outer door opened , to admit a body of armed musketeers , who stood at attention while Oliver proceeded . " You call yourselves a Parliament ? You are no Parliament ? I say you are no Parliament . . . Corrupt unjust persons . . Depart , I say , and let us have done with you . In the name of God ? go l " Seizing the mace and crying out " What shall we do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Speaker Lenthall was led from his chair and out of the House , and the Long Parliament after twelve years of many and memorable glories had slumbered itself into an ignominious end . On June 6th , Cromwell issued a summons to a hundred and forty men nominated by himself and the Council of Officers , calling them to London on immediate business of State . A fur- // ther act of despotism , but in its choice of men very liberal and discriminating . The Little Parliament , otherwise designated also after one of its members , Mr. Praisegod Barebones , was scrupulously representative of the best elements in national Puritanism both in and out of the army . It met in the Council-chamber at Whitehall , and on July 4th Cromwell opened its proceedings with a long speech reviewing the history of the past twenty years , defining the purposes that had inspired the revolution , tracing the events of the war , and reciting the misdemeanours of the recently expelled Rump . The enemies of truth had been vanquished in the field ; it was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just Government in peace . A new Executive Council of State , they were informed , had been chosen , " eight or nine of them being Members of the House that late was . " This Council was to sit only at the bidding of his hearers . And so they parted on the first day : " I say , you are called with an high calling . And why should we be afraid to say or think , that this may be the door to usher in the things that God has promised ? " But it was not to be . The Little Parliament did not slumber ; it attended diligently to business , and did much useful work in clearing out the pigeon-holes of some dust and rubbish . But // the praisegods began to get the upper hand , and wanted to introduce inquisitorial practices in the Church not at all in keeping with the new independent doctrines . Also some members proposed to abolish the Court of Chancery , as being an intolerable nuisance to everyone but the lawyers , who promptly became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than six months , a minority of the House by a snap vote declared that this Parliament was of no further use to the State , and resigned its powers to Cromwell as president of the Council . What was really happening was that the Puritan revolution had now passed into its last and least impressive phase . At first there had been the sublimely mysterious stirring of popular conscience seeking to enfranchise itself . Then had come such a compact between the Bible and the sword as can be found nowhere else in history , a compact made possible only by the unique disposition of the Puritan character . And now the heroic days were dwindling into the shabby scuffles of politics . The liberal heart and mind of England could form no party that was not teased at every turn by craft and envy from without , and by irresolution within . The vision was unabated with the power in one man alone , and Cromwell was now to accept a responsibility under which he would have reason // enough to cry out in wearier moods that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament disbanded on December 2nd , 1653 . On the 12th the Council of State met to consider what was to be done , and on the 16th Oliver Cromwell was publicly proclaimed Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England , Scotland and Ireland . At the installation in Westminster Hall , he wore " a rich but plain suit ; black velvet , with cloak of the same ; about his hat a broad band of gold . " 216 XX PROTECTORATE PARLIAMENT XX FIRST PROTECTORATE PARLIAMENT IN the first charter of the Protectorate , it was ordained that a full and free Parliament should be summoned on the third of September following , the date being fixed in commemoration of Dunbar and Worcester . Until it sat Cromwell was given powers to enact such laws as he thought necessary for the government of the country . He was thus for eight months a more absolute ruler than ever Charles T had aspired to be . He did not abuse his privileges , but he was not long in learning that the position of an elected head of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could not , indeed , for long be a tenable one . From the beginning plots were to be found under any and every Royalist , Leveller , or Anabaptist bush . Many of them aimed directly at the life of the Protector . Of these Oliver took little or no notice , proceeding in extreme cases as far as a conviction , and then telling the conspirators to be off and find some better occupation , until at last examples had to be made in self-defence . 2I9
