Throughout the U. S. last week , many a musical citizen trilled on the keyboards of a Chickering , of a Knabe , of a Mason &; Hamlin piano , all products of American Piano Co. factories . The Knabe is the official piano of the Metropolitan Opera Company ; Jeritza , Ponselle , Titta Ruffo use it . Moiseiwitsch , Bauer , Ravel endorse Mason &; Hamlin . The Chickering advertises itself as " essentially a piano for the home , " is the oldest in the U. S .. was the favorite of Franz Liszt. * And almost all great pianists have made music rolls for the Ampico reproducing grands , which are also an American Piano Co. product . None would therefore deny ( although they might prefer others ; that American Piano Co. pianos are good pianos . <P> But that did not prevent the American Piano Co. last week from suffering a sudden glissando into the hands of receivers ( Manhattan 's Irving Trust Co. , appointed by Judge Alfred C. Coxe ) . The petitioners were W. D. Byrnes , Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $7,000 , declared that the company 's property was valued at $3,689,000. that its current and unpaid liabilities were $1,200,000 , that its property assets could not be immediately realized without great sacrifice . <P> American Piano ( chartered in 1908 ) had a long and successful business career until 19-27 , when common dividends were first passed . In 1928 the last preferred dividends were paid and the year ending March 31 , 1929 , showed a deficit of $235,235 . Last July President George Urquhart reported that " decline in demand for pianos which started in 1927 continued through 1928 , and in the present year to date . " <P> Long has it been common knowledge that the phonograph and the radio were proving themselves formidable rivals to the piano . Long has American Piano unsuccessfully attempted to fight this rivalry . At the height of phonograph popularity in 1922. they bought the J. &; C. Fisher Co. and Amphion Co. , manufacturers of player-piano actions . Following acquisition Amphion perfected the Ampico reproducing attachments and although the manufacture of player-pianos has been practically discontinued , Ampicos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlin for installation in their most pretentious grands . This year American Piano added a complete line of radios to their sales list in the twelve American retail stores , in the hope that dwindling piano sales might be offset . But the high price of pianos has not been able to compete with the comparatively low price of radios and phonographs . Since 1924 when total U. S. shipment of pianos was 300,000 , sales have steadily decreased . Estimated sales for 1929 are but 115,000 . <P> More immediate cause of American Piano 's difficulty however , is installment buying , which while it has helped to sell pianos has not added any appreciable amount to their working capital . <P> The Irving Trust Co. has announced that the company will continue to operate so that the Metropolitan will still be Knabe equipped , the Chickering will go to many a home and artists will continue to use Mason &; Hamlin . And stockholders were somewhat cheered by the assurance in the receivership petition that although the company at present was " unable to meet its matured debts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish adequate means to borrow money . " American Piano is " still solvent . "
