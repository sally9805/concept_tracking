W HY does any one want a " collected edition " of anything ? That is a question I often ask myself when I turn from the shelves in my library where the collected editions , each in the full panoply and monotony of its uniform binding , stand in august and unsympathetic splendour , to those other shelves , crowded with faded and alluringly well-read volumes , the first , or at least the early , unpretentious editions before the halo of " collected " was wrapped about the author 's head . And yet , even as I leave the half-calf , seventeen volume Browning for Paracelsus in boards and Men and Women in faded green cloth , I know full well the answer ; for all of us are not sentimental book-collectors or connoisseurs of literary vintages , and even those of us who are , at times , these reprehensible things , may be , at other times , critics and students , and to critics and students the " collected edition " is a handy tool . Still , if a critic wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means ignore the earlier issues of his author 's books . So book-collectors are of some use other than the sentimental , after all . Lazy readers like collected editions because , in buying them , they are sure of getting all of an author 's books without the trouble of knowing their titles beforehand . Impecunious readers ( by far the largest class everywhere at all times ) get much for little , and this last is reason enough to account for the fondness of publishers for this particular article . Yet I can never help feeling that a " collected edition " is something like a tombstone set at the head of its author 's " six feet of earth . " Of course , there is really nothing to prevent an author 's adding new books to those already collected , nothing at all . But the very fact of their being a collection proclaims to the world not only that a man has done something , but that that something will , in all probability , be the major part of his production . If to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going a bit far , we can at least consider that with it the " six feet " are at any rate pre-empted , and the tombstone designed , with nothing lacking but the inscription .  | Mr Robinson 's Collected Poems does not intimidate by its voluminousness as Browning 's seventeen volumes certainly do . But , as I heave its weight off the table beside me and strain my eyes over its narrow-spaced type , I sigh for the charming little volumes in which I am wont to read him ; and , having collated the contents of this big book with the eight little ones , I put it down and read the poems for their poetry in the smaller volumes . This Collected Poems is valuable only for its cheapness , it costs less than the eight separate volumes put together , but there its value stops , unless we take it in some measure as accolade ? an accolade by no means needed by the poet ? and it is a little jarring to find a tombstone preparing for so very much alive and active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not written out , he is producing more rapidly every year . As to accolade , is it possible for any man to receive a greater tribute from his contemporaries than the spontaneous appreciations printed by the New York Times on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday , two years ago ' ? Mr Robinson has always been extremely reticent in , what I may call , propria persona . He writes poems for publication , never prose . He has given us no hint in any paper or review of his opinions of his fellow poets or himself , he has never put on record in ordinary speech his reactions to the literature of the past . He places no prefaces before his books ; he and his poetry are indivisible , what we make of him is what we make of that , if we are the public . But it is just because of this that the collected edition becomes of real value to the student , for his exclusions and inclusions in the matter of poems do open up a certain insight into his mind . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully-fledged and fully armed , that , to continue my extremely mixed metaphor , he has grown very few new feathers in the course of years , and that his sword has not only not been stropped since the beginning , it has not needed stropping . There are various ways of collecting poems . The horrible way of the Browning editors has been to group together poems of a species , thus losing all the aesthetic value of the juxtaposition of a poem of one type with a poem of another type . Wise authors compose their books to obviate weariness . In a grouping by types there is no escape for a reader but to close the book . Another way of collecting is the quasi-chronological , followed by Buxton-Forman in his Keats editions ? the early poems come first and each book is given intact in  | the order of its first appearance . Still another way is the strictly chronological , in which separate books are entirely ignored and the poems are placed in the order in which they were written . Mr Robinson 's plan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection published in the poet 's lifetime , the method he has adopted is excellent . He has kept his books intact throughout , but he begins with The Man Against the Sky and follows it with his first volume , The Children of the Night . After this , the books succeed one another in the sequence of their publication , except that Merlin is interpolated between Captain Craig and The Town Down the River , for no reason that I can see unless to separate it from Lancelot . Here we are at once at a bit of personal criticism . For it is evident that Mr Robinson agrees with the majority of his critics in considering The Man Against the Sky his best book . He has made no changes in it , no changes in the order of the poems , that is . I have not sought for textual changes in many of the poems , but in those I have examined minutely there are none . In fact , the only volumes he has felt called upon to edit are The Children of the Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant that he has dropped thirteen of the original poems from The Children of the Night and only one from The Town Down the River . A man who shows himself not averse to excisions on occasion , and yet who finds all he wishes to make ( with one exception ) in his earliest published work , proves his artistic career to have been singularly of a piece . This fact is evidence that if he and his creative faculty started together , his power of self-criticism has grown , for he has made no mistake in his excisions . The poems he has left out need cause no reader regret , except possibly the title poem of The Children of the Night , and that is not so important as poetry as it is as revelation . Without it , the critic must begin with Mr Robinson in mid-air . Four years ago , I wrote an article on Mr Robinson which was afterwards reprinted as the first chapter of my Tendencies in Modern American Poetry , and nothing since has caused me to alter the opinions I there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps by which I reached my conclusions , but I can write nothing on Mr Robinson without stating as a point of departure the main theme of my argument . Let us begin at once by acknowledging that Mr Robinson is the most finished and settled of the poets alive in America to-day . By  | " finished , " I mean accomplished , polished , master of his medium ; by " settled , " I mean fixed and oriented in his own point of view and expression . If a contemporary dare to say that any living writer is sure to rank among the most important poets of his nation , I dare to say this of Mr Robinson . Granting that , then , and admitting that contemporary judgement is a hazardous undertaking , let us see how and why he is what he is , and briefly consider that he is ? what ' ? The main theme by which I set such store is that Mr Robinson is a sort of temporal Colossus of Rhodes ; he straddles a period . It seems to me almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society into which he was born . Recollect what Puritanism has meant to America , the good and the bad . Remember how long it held sway , and realize that this sway persisted much longer in the small towns and country districts than it did in the large cities . l2r Robinson grew up in the ' seventies and ' eighties , and if any reader can recall from personal experience country New England in the ' seventies and ' eighties , no more need be said . This growing up of Mr Robinson 's took place in Gardiner , a most charming little town on the Kennebec River in Maine . I love Gardiner myself , but I can imagine what it must have been like in the ' seventies and ' eighties . How Mr Robinson could have started , as he did , in the heart of Gardiner , we can not even conceive until we know more of him and his antecedents than we know now . From Gardiner he went to Harvard , and Harvard in the early ' nineties I do remember . Need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forcing bed for Mr Robinson 's genius , but still it must have been an improvement on Gardiner . Now Mr Robinson is a dyed-in-the-wool New Englander , and that must never be forgotten . His tenacity of purpose is thoroughly New England , so is his austerity and his horror of exuberance of expression . His insight into people is pure Yankee shrewdness , as is also his violent and controlled passion . He is absolutely a native of his place , the trouble was that he was not a native of his time . He was twenty years ahead of his time , and that advance has set the seal of melancholy upon him ; or , to speak in the cant of the day , it has wound him in inhibitions which he has been unable to shake off . This is why The Children of the Night ( the poem , not the book ) is so important . It shows Mr Robinson avowing a creedless religion . I say a creedless religion advisedly , for I do not imagine Mr Robin- son to be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gardiner must have made the holder of it feel as though branded with the mark of Cain . Now evolution , in religion as in other things , is a sane and salutary process which leads to no bitterness and is merely the door to freedom . Revolution , on the other hand , is the bread of sorrow and the wine of despair . To be called upon to do in oneself in a few years what nations take centuries in bringing about , means a severe wrenching of intellect and emotion . Read Matthew Arnold 's Dover Beach and see what the admitting of a creedless religion means to a man brought up to a formal order , or , indeed , read The Children of the Night . There is gain , of course , but that is dim ; there is loss , and that is present and overwhelming . Mr Robinson could by no means be Gardiner , he could by no means be America at that moment . He began to see life with a touch of irony because it was not his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ; he withdrew more and more , but he would not compromise . He would be himself regardless of consequences , but that self was an outsider . And , all the time , the old order was holding him , shackling him ; again and again he escaped , but it was one continuous fight between himself and himself , between the old Puritan atavism and the new , free spirit . Every poem that Mr Robinson writes is his dual self personified . If he thought his own thoughts , he could in no wise control the form in which he set them ; if he spoke his own direct speech , he could put it to no unrestrained or novel music . The luxuriance he innately feared , he drove away ; to him , it was an intellectual scarlet woman . He could not be happy , but he could be strong . He could mutter " Courage ! " and nerve himself to endurance . He looked to no future , he had no time to build a new order and never guessed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his point of view , above water , and he strove magnificently . This is what we read in The Children of the Night , Captain Craig , and The Town Down the River . He raised for himself an altar ? the success of failure ? and at this he warmed his heart . It is a meagre flame , but it has sufficed him , and we must not quarrel that the pedestal is gaunt and severe . Then , suddenly , in 1912 , a new interest in poetry began to manifest itself . Mr Robinson very likely did not think of himself as a part of it , at first ; and I am sure that with much that has come to pass since he has been heartily out of sympathy . But , whatever he may  | have thought , he was its forerunner ; he was even more than that , he was its oldest and most respected exemplar . And however the " new poetry " may have affected Mr Robinson , it brought his audience in its train . He had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many . It is good for an artist to be admired , and The Man Against the Sky , published six years after its predecessor , The Town Down the River , shows a heightening of power in every direction . Before , he had written almost defiantly , now he is satisfied to write , now he has the contact of an audience to spur him on . There is no new departure in The Man Against the Sky ? Mr Robinson struck his gait in The Children of the Night and he has scarcely varied it since ? but there is a greater ease and abundance . Flammonde is one of the most beautiful poems in stanza form that Mr Robinson has done , Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford probably the best of his monologues . The Man Against the Sky itself , an advance over The Children of the Night . That poem was a cry , this is a question . The excellence of his early vignettes , John Evereldown , Cliff Klingenhagen , Richard Cory , could hardly be surpassed , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Poor Relation , an extraordinary weirdness and horror in Stafford 's Cabin . Captain Craig contained Isaac and Archibald and Aunt Imogen , and nothing could be better in their kinds than these , but John Gorham far outdoes The Woman and the Wife and The Book of Annandale . Mr Robinson is always at his best in contemporary scenes , and among contemporary people , with the brilliant exception of Ben Jonson . His historical monologues are seldom apt as portraiture . An Island , in which the dying Napoleon is the speaker , is false to its original in every line . Saint Paul addressing the Romans in The Three Taverns is a daring attempt which utterly fails . Lazarus lacks everything except its excellent execution . In Rahel to Varnhagen , Mr Robinson has been able to feel that his characters are contemporary , and to deal with them as though he had created them , and the result is a triumph of two people and an atmosphere . Two people and an atmosphere is Mr Robinson 's forte . Crowd his stage as in Captain Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his edge becomes blunted . It may be objected that Captain Craig is virtually a monologue , but we can never forget the chorus of young men who are talked at , and the shadowy recorder who is occasionally  | permitted to speak . Mr Robinson needs to feel his characters in intimate contact , which is very natural . Emotions run deeper and higher between two people who are in close relations with each other than they do in any other sort of grouping except that of a mob swayed by some over-mastering impulse . Mr Robinson is too selective and secret to find inspiration in a mob . We can not imagine his poems become the marching cry of a multitude . He builds his poetic world out of a series of poignant incidents , and by the deftest of little touches . The crumbling of Merlin 's world is shown more vividly in the old man 's appreciative dalliance with Vivian than in his weary reception of the king 's agonized questions . In Lancelot , the hopeless fate of King Arthur 's realm does not lie for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in the king 's chamber at dawn , where Arthur , Gawaine , and Bedivere await the first stroke of what all are aware is doom ; it is not even in the conversation between Lancelot and the dying Gawaine . It is in the meeting of Lancelot and Guinevere in the garden , in their terrible interview by fire-light with the rain streaming over the deserted battlefields outside . It should be also in the final parting of Lancelot and Guinevere in the convent parlour , but it is not , for the single reason that the poem is already spent emotionally before the end is reached . This chill finale Mr Robinson surely expected to be an epitome of the whole tragic tale , but the parting of the lovers is too cool in its outward aspect to rouse his invention , and the final scene is a succinct , but rather stereotyped , winding up . In spite of Mr Robinson 's fine gift of irony , he has a real liking for the melodramatic . Where the human element is very powerful , this urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutters like a coming storm outside the scene on which the event is staged ; but where the human element is , for any reason , weakened to the poet 's mind , melodrama runs foaming over the story . The worst example of this is Avon 's Harvest , but there are many other cases in which the same thing happens in a greater or lesser degree : London Bridge , for example , or The Valley of the Shadow , or The Return of Morgan and Fingal . There is not the slightest objection to melodrama as such , but when Mr Robinson can skate the edge of it so successfully as he often does , to plunge in seems a lowering of technique . I believe that the reason for this sensation of lowering is because the poet 's peculiar tenderness and pity are drowned out when mere event becomes too strenuous . For melodrama is circumstance due to exter- nal happening ; tragedy is circumstance due to human emotion . A melodramatic occurrence such as Macbeth 's murder of Banquo may rise to tragedy through its result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the spark to light his tragedy , but with Mr Robinson melodrama , when he indulges in it , is itself alone . Perhaps I should qualify this , as Stafford 's Cabin , Richard Cory , and many other poems skirt melodrama all the time by virtue of their subjects , but in these cases it is so obviously subordinate to the human scheme as scarcely to deserve its name . I have spoken of Mr Robinson 's feeling for atmosphere . Never were pictures drawn with more economy than those he gives us , but they are unforgettable . Since the first day I read it , I have never forgotten how " The cottage of old Archibald appeared . Little and white and high on a smooth round hill It stood , with hackmatacks and apple-trees Before it , and a big barn-roof beyond ; And over the place ? trees , house , fields and all ? Hovered an air of still simplicity And a fragrance of old summers . " Again , take the house in Fragment : " Faint white pillars that seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees Of his house where it hides and dies in a shade Of beeches and oaks and hickory trees . " Merlin is full of pictures , and they are no longer of New England ; we feel the difference at once , not only in the scenes themselves , but in the more elaborate wording with which they are presented : " Gay birds Were singing high to greet him all along A broad and sanded woodland avenue That led him on forever , so he thought , Until at last there was an end of it ; And at the end there was a gate of iron , Wrought heavily and invidiously barred .  | He pulled a cord that rang somewhere a bell Of many echoes , and sat down to rest , Outside the keeper 's house , upon a bench Of carven stone that might for centuries Have waited there in silence to receive him . The birds were singing still ; leaves flashed and swung Before him in the sunlight ; a soft breeze Made intermittent whisperings around him Of love and fate and danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly as they touched him . " People are sketched quite as briefly and inevitably as places . Mr Robinson has the gift of epigrammatic expression . Flammonde comes from " . . . God knows where , With firm address and foreign air , With news of nations in his talk And something royal in his walk . " Richard Cory " glittered when he walked . " Aaron Stark 's " . . . thin , pinched mouth was nothing but a mark ; And when he spoke there came like sullen blows Through scattered fangs a few snarled words and close , As if a cur were chary of its bark . " Mr Robinson is a master of brevity and exact , straight-forward speech in his poems , and that makes his frequent habit of circumlocution appear not a little odd and contradictory . It almost seems as though Mr Robinson were , at times , afraid of his own theory of straight-forward speech . He refers to the characteristics of a certain gentleman as " his index of adagios , " he speaks of billiard balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls a hypodermic syringe " a slight kind of engine . " I believe this sort of verbal juggling is an atavistic impulse ; the same fear of the commonplace which produced the old poetical jargon which Mr Robinson has done so much to banish from present-day poetry .  | Allied to this tendency is the cryptic quality of much of his work . Although I do not believe for a moment that he realizes it , this cryptic quality is merely a poetic trick . All poets have their technical tricks , and all good poets make use of suggestion , but suggestion which has to be worked out like a puzzle , and half-statements confused in their own windings , are tricks carried a little too far . Browning was obscure because of a certain difficulty of expression ; he triumphed in spite of it , not because of it . But Browning was crystal clear compared to Mr Robinson in these cases . And Mr Robinson has never the slightest difficulty in expressing himself . No , this is a poetic manner due to atavism , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already spoken . Edwin Arlington Robinson is a man of stark and sheer vision . He found his voice at a time when America was given over to prettyprettinesses of all kinds . Some curious instinct for a harsher diet turned him to Crabbe . That alone would show how solitary a thing his development has been , for few poets have been more persistently neglected than George Crabbe . Mr Robinson 's sonnet on him begins by admitting the neglect : " Give him the darkest inch your shelf allows , Hide him in lonely garrets , if you will , But his hard , human pulse is throbbing still . " It is just the " hard , human pulse " that Mr Robinson craved for his own work . He is a far better poet than ever Crabbe was , because Crabbe saw only what is , while Mr Robinson has a deep insight into why it is . In this , he is more akin to Thomas Hardy , whom he has celebrated in another poem in The Children of the Night , omitted in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as longing " to feel once more a human atmosphere " and this he finds in the " grand sad song " which is Hardy 's , given under the figure of a river . The poem ends : " Across the music of its onward flow I saw the cottage lights of Wessex gleam . " The hard , human pulse in Thomas Hardy is mellowed and deepened by a poetry of soul which Crabbe had not . Mr Robinson has this  | poetry of soul to a far greater extent than Crabbe , but he has not yet attained to the reach of Thomas Hardy . Hardy is no such poetical technician as Mr Robinson , but he has a more probing understanding . Hardy touches his characters reverently , even as he dissects them ; Mr Robinson is not reverent , his nearest approach to it is a dry-eyed pity . Mr Robinson has resisted life ; Hardy has submitted to life as to a beloved master . Hardy is a great architect of tales and poems , The Dynasts is monumental in conception and arrangement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare craftsman of detail , but his vision is pointillistic . I have dwelt so long upon the juxtaposition of these two poets because such a juxtaposition makes clear what Mr Robinson has and what he lacks . Thomas Hardy is a product of evolution , Mr Robinson of revolution . His own lines in Lancelot sum up his position not too badly : " God , what a rain of ashes falls on him Who sees the new but can not leave the old . " Mr Robinson has left the old , but the dust of it on his shoes still impedes him at times ; and he has struggled laboriously out of the rain of ashes , although the white powder lingers on his coat . Some critics have professed to find in Mr Robinson 's work the beating of the knell of doom . I think that is to mistake his attitude and the subtlety of his thought . Doom there may be , but it is an adjunct , not a preoccupation . His preoccupation is with the unanswered question : Is the Light real or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbolstered by logic an act of cowardice or an expression of unconscious , pondering intellectuality ? There are poems of his to illustrate all these angles of vision . He doubts himself into cynicism , and rises from it through the conception of unexplained beauty . He seeks below life for the undercurrents by which he may discover its meaning . Sometimes he finds one thing , sometimes another ; but , whatever he finds , the innate Puritan fortitude and spirituality keep him to his quest . He has not reached his goal nor found his Grail , but he never turns aside from the search , continuing it always with a wistful nobility of purpose which our literature has not seen before . The arrival of a belated admiration has had a twofold effect upon the poet . It has induced a more abundant creation , and it has urged  | his ambition to attempt things of larger scope . Here I think we can say that Mr Robinson has possibly not been wise . The technique of the short or semi-long poem , he has mastered completely ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek models . Merlin as a series of intervals ( particularly lyric intervals ) is excellent . As a whole long poem , it is inchoate and without direction or climax . These faults do not appear in Lancelot , but something else does . Mr Robinson himself abdicates in favour of many masters of the past . The poem is built , not after a pattern , but to a pattern . It is fine , moving , dramatic , but it is so in just the manner hallowed by time . Mr Robinson does manage to creep in here and there , but , as a rule , some one else takes his place , not any particular person , Mr Robinson does not plagiarize , but a fusion of dramatic poets all speaking at once . Mr Robinson 's old gospel of failure serves him again in Lancelot . The " Light " he has always believed in shines somberly across the poem , but , more than in Merlin , it seems a will-o ' - the- wisp gleam . The only hint of poignance in the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to emit any warm glow . Lancelot riding away , seeking to comfort himself by this wan flame , is a pathetic figure . Mr Robinson 's poetry is pathetic , even when it is most vigorous . There is infinite pathos in the lot of the pioneer . Mr Robinson is rather more an outcast from an old order than an enthusiastic adherent of a new . He is preoccupied with the effort and pain of escape . Recognition has come too late for him to experience the sharp joy which lies in conscious upbuilding . It is almost as though he regarded his achieved position with something akin to wonder . He has always believed in his work , but it is a new sensation to believe in the public , and he seems scarcely to dare to surrender himself to the thought of success . Success is a heady wine . In Mr Robinson 's case , fearful a he is to find himself sipping it , it has induced both a greater desire to write and a greater self-consciousness , but it has also lulled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beverage . Would he have written Avon 's Harvest ten years ago ? Avon 's Harvest appears to be a mere tale . A " detective story , " as Mr Robinson has called it , told for the pleasure of the telling . In many other poets , this would be enough , but it is not enough where Mr Robinson is concerned . If the poem could be taken as a psychological study of fear , it might justify its existence ? as far as theme  | is concerned , its execution is , of course , admirable ? but the evidence of the very tangible dagger on the dictionary , and the presence of the man passing before the house , are too obviously real to leave the fear in the realm of psychology . No , Mr Robinson 's bugbear has fairly got him in this book . It is melodrama pure and simple , and , no matter how well it is done , melodrama shorn of suggestion is not worthy of Mr Robinson . I may point out what melodrama can do when used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent a book as Mr Aiken 's Punch . I have already cited Macbeth as an example , Faust is another , but there are so many examples they have only to be thought of . I believe that Avon 's Harvest is the direct result of Mr Robinson 's deserved success . Some poets thrive best on lack of recognition ; let us hope that Mr Robinson is not one of these , for of all living poets he is the one most assured of his future . He can never again compose in a sympathetic seclusion , but he must shut his ears to plaudits and censures , he must forget his assured public and seek again the silence of his own personality which seems the only condition under which his genius can freely create . Mr Robinson 's is not a wide or inclusive art ; it is narrow and deep . He has almost no early failures to look back upon with regret . His later work shows no marked advance over his earlier , even in the matter of technique . More than any other poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably young , and we can scarcely expect any considerable increase of cubits to come . Mr Robinson is a poet of extraordinary , if restricted , achievement , he is at the fulness of his power , and that he will add many more to these collected poems is certain , but , more or not , he has won a high and permanent place in American literature .  |
