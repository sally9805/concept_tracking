txt Willium P. Ferguson , archeologist and author of Franklin , Pa. , was on his way east today after announcing here yeserday : hat he had discovered the ruins of an anti . r.t . city , inhabited probably 1,000 to 200 years ago , on Isle Royale , off : he ti th shore of Lake Superior . Isle Royale is a part of the state of IfilchiTait . Mt . Ferguson announced he would return next summer with another expedi ! iOn to conduct further explorations of Ill , city , which was situated , he said , on thn southerly side of the island and consisted of a series of semi-underground dwellings . Copper Mined There Long Ago . " Most every one knows , " Mr. Ferguson said in making known his discovery , " that copper was mined on Isle Royale . many years ago on land now covered with pine trees . The island is covered with traces of these mines , and yet almost nothing has been done to explore the workings . " No one has found any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many stories of finding tempered copper.weapons . I have found several stone hammers , each supplied with thongs , and have been interested for the last three years in establishing reports that a town existed on the south of the island . " A writer named Gilman was authority for this report fifty years ago , but his description and location were so vague that it was impossible for any one to make anything out of them . " Waterfall Is Clew . Mr. Ferguson told of his first trip in the region at the outlet of Stskiwitt lake , which he said he thought tallied with Gilman 's data , but there was no trace of a town . Last year he found a waterfall which he thought was the one mentioned in Gilman 's report . Because of the lateness of the season , however , the explorer was unable to finish itis work , he said , and so made a third trip this season with a party of five assistants , but their first efforts failed to locate the town . A length Mr. Ferguson concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer a certain description of the topography of the country as given by the writer of a half century ago . He continued his search , he said , and finally was rewarded by finding what he considers unmistakable traces of a town between tiny hay and the waterfall on the south side of Isle Royale.
