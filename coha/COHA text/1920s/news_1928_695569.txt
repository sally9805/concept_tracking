txt Great Britain intends to go slowly in naval construction and has no intention of building in competition with the United States , Premier Baldwin told 10,000 cheering auditors at the Albert Hall tonight at a great meeting celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the British League of Nations Union . The Prime Minister expressed profound regret at the " temporary failure to come to an agreement with America on naval matters " and deplored those reports which have crossed the ocean indicating " deep suspicion " of Great Britain in the minds of many Americans . The Premier seized the occasion to deny charges that the Conservative Government had departed from the policy of Locarno in favor of a renewed Anglo-French entente . " We have made no new engagements , " the Premier said . " There is no change in the orientation of our policy . Our interests and inclinations alike prompt us to preserve and even to strengthen the cordiality of our relations with Germany as well as France . We can justly claim that we have played some part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hail Kellogg Treaty . The Kellogg treaty for the outlawry of war was hailed not only by Mr. Baldwin but also by Viscount Grey of Fallodon as an advance on the road to peace , surpassing the realization of most people at the present time . Lord Grey , thanking America for giving this treaty to the world , declared that he believed the treaty was " more serviceable to the cause of peace than if the United States had joined the League of Nations as a hesitant and reluctant member . " The statesman who threw the weight of Britain into the World War in August , 1914. now nearly blind and speaking but rarely in public , received a great ovation as he took his place on the platform beside Viscount Cecil of Chelwood , J. R. Clynes , representative of the Labor Party , and other prominent political leaden= doing homage to b Leaeme ideas . But the obvious hero of the League of Nations Union , which staged the great rally , was Viscount Cecil , who made his first appearance on the same platform with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva Naval Conference . It was Lord Cecil who moved the vote of thanks on behalf of the League of Nations Union to the Premier for his oration . Viscount Grey referred directly to the fifteen-cruiser bill now pending before the United States Congress . " I understand the United States is likely to pass a measure for building fifteen more cruisers , " he said . " After that they will look overseas to see what we are going to do . The Prime Minister has just given us an assurance that we shall not keep up with them . " King George Praises Union . The Premier read a message of greeting to the meeting from King George , congratulating the Union on its tenth anniversary and declaring that he appreciated " the efforts of the members to educate public opinion in support of the League , where- in lies our chief hope for the future peace of the world . " At the start of his address Mr. Baldwin recalled the origin of the League as not only Wilsonian but partly French , partly British . In Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office drafted the Phillimore report for the consideration of the War Cabinet , " which became the foundation of the League 's Constitution . " The Prime Minister reviewed the work of the League of Nations during eight years of its existence , declaring that its record of settlement of disputes had been ample to an ? swer skeptics of its efficacy . He noted the settlement of the Aaland Island controversy between Sweden and Finland ; boundary sett'ements involving Serbia , Greece and Albania ; the conciliation of Germany and Poland over Silesia , and a settlement between Britain and Tur key over Iraq . He cited seventeen awards and sixteen advisory opinions of the League 's Court at the Hague in seven years of its career . He praised the League 's handling of the question of Greek refugees from Asia Minor , numerous humanitarian conventions it had been able to get nations to sign , and its financial aid to war-stricken countries . He then turned to current international politics . " This is a great record of the League 's , " he said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive Governments , has played in it . We are not a vindictive or a rancorous people . Stresses Friendly Relations . " I doubt if any people has subdued the war spirit more than we have . While we have maintained , indeed improved . our close relations with France , we have established completely friendly relations with the most powerful of our former enemies . " I must contradict the idea which has gained currency in some quarters and for which there is no shadow of foundation , that we have to some extent abandoned our position of impartiality and conciliation be ? we assumed at the time of the Locarno pact . That is not so . We have made no new commitments and there is no new orientation of our policy . " The Premier 's words on AngloAmerican relations follow : " I regret profoundly the temporary failure to come to an agreement with the United States on naval matters . T ' . e only negotiations which I have taken part in with America were negotiations concerning the debt five and a half years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat difficult subject nothing could have exceeded the frankness displayed on both sides . There was no suspicion of any kind in the minds of the Americans with whom I negotiated and a settlement was reached which has been regarded rightly as fair and honorable by both sides . I say that because I must add , to my profound regret , that such speeches as I have been able to read from America lead me to believe that on most subjects , far different from my experience , there is a deep suspicion where this country is concerned and where the actions of this country are concerned . " There is no echo in this country of that . Our policy in naval building is to go slow . We have no intention of building in competition with the United States . We had come to that decision and we built slowly long before we were asked and signed the Kellogg pact , and I should like to express my pleasure at this time that the pact has been signed . We have deliberately turned our back on war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . We are grateful to Mr. Kellogg for bringing this treaty with him to Europe . It gives us all what in our private spiritual life we should all be grateful for  --  a fresh start . " One word as to what that pact means . We are trying to regulate and govern primeval instincts which are older than the nations that are trvin ' themselves to govern them . " Absolutism in monarchies is dead , and absolutism in States is going . " Grey Hails Our Attitude . Viscount Grey , acting as Chairman of the meeting , remembered that " the League received a great blow ? and some people thought a fatal blow ? when the United States of America , whose President had so much to do in founding it , decided not to join . " In spite of that the League had prevented more than one war , he said , and had become more and more recognized as the established institution through which international affairs should be conducted . Concerning America 's present attitude toward the League . Lord Grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the world was so impressed by the last war that it determined to have an instrument which would prevent war in the future . That determination has existed not only among members of the League , but it has also found expression , and particular expression in the United States of America . The United States has shown no inclination to join the League of Nations . So far as we can judge they are as far away as ever . But they have shown a desire to take parallel action in the world in the same direction as the League . The fact that the United States should have taken the initiative in parallel action to that of the League of Nations in establishing a new barrier , additional to the covenant of the League , against aggressive war is , I believe , more favorable to the cause of peace than even if the United States had joined the League as a reluctant and hesitating member . " That shows there is a sort of inflluence in the world wl 1.1/1 seems to be working generally to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work equally to make the pact for the renunciation of war a vital ti-ing as an instrument to be used to prevent future wars .
