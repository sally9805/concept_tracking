Washington , where visiting shows are thoroughly appreciated , was entertained last week by a one-man act which gained fame on European circuits last summer and on the Southern circuit last month . <P> The act opened at a hotel breakfast table . James J. Walker , the dapper , glib , little mick who is Mayor of New York , was pleading with photographers and newsgatherers . He held up his coffee cup . " I really want to drink it , " he said . <P> The telephone rang and said , " Secretary Mellon will wait 15 minutes longer for you . " Mayor Walker eased into his modish overcoat and observed : " I am happy wherever I am . That 's why I hate to leave . " <P> Photographers begged for one more picture , on the hotel steps with the manager . Mayor Walker , letting Secretary Mellon wait , obliged . Then he motored to the Treasury Department . The chauffeur wanted to stop at the Secretary 's private entrance but Mayor Walker wisecracked : " Better go in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better places than that . " <P> Treasury stenographers crowded out to see the visiting comedian . " Just like the City Hall , " he chirped . " Nobody works here . " <P> Secretary Mellon , waiting inside with Attorney General Sargent and Postmaster General New , at last received the Mayor , who thereupon had to be photographed for 15 minutes more . While the cameras ticked , Postmaster General New remarked : " It 's a hell of a long time for a New Yorker to be still . " <P> The New Yorker piped back : " What we ca n't cure we have to endure . " <P> The cabinet gentlemen then heard his arguments about a new Federal building in Manhattan and moving a New York postoffice . When the Mayor emerged it was 12.25 p.m . He had been due at the White House at noon . <P> Secretary Everett Sanders , knowing the chronic Walker tardiness , had reserved no definite portion of President Coolidge 's time , but the latter would ordinarily have gone to lunch before 12.32 p.m. when Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Mayor . " <P> " Glad to meet you , Mr. President . " <P> " What luck are you having here ? " <P> " I hope to succeed . " <P> Newsgatherers asked later what the two had talked about . " About three minutes , " grinned the Mayor . He said President Coolidge was " a peach ; " Postmaster General New , " all to the good ; " Attorney General Sargent , " pretty hard-boiled ; " Secretary Mellon , " one of the most delightful personalities I ever met . I can see why people who know him like Mr. Mellon . I liked him first rate . " <P> At the Senate office building , Mayor Walker rapped with his cane on the door of a fellow Tammany-man , Senator Wagner . After cheers and handshaking , the party rode to the Capitol on the " subway " ( a small , electric , underground train connecting the Senators ' offices with their clubroom ) . <P> Hearing that Senator Heflin had the floor , Mayor Walker riposted : " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House end of the Capitol were Speaker Longworth 's pink face and chubby smile . <P> Mayor : " You told me the best joke I ever heard . " <P> Speaker : " There 's a lady present . " <P> Mayor : " Oh , I 'm not going to tell it . "
