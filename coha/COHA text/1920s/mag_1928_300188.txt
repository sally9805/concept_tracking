Tennis Tycoon William Tatem Tilden II must have been pleasantly surprised that despite the ban placed upon his tennis playing activities by the U. S. Lawn Tennis Association and extended last week by the International Lawn Tennis Federation , he could still play as an amateur in Russia or in Abyssinia . In the 35 principal tennis-playing countries of the world , including Cuba , Japan and Monaco , he will be considered a professional , because last summer he wrote reports of British tournaments for U. S. news-sheets.
