More than one Mexican spectator stood up and yelled : " We would rather lose than watch that gringo play . " <P> The gringo in question was Robert Kinsey , of U. S. birth , but a member of the Mexican Davis Cup Team . His play last week in the tennis matches against the U. S. was indifferent , almost sour . William Tatem Tilden II ran him razzle-frazzle in three straight sets . That was the beginning of a clean sweep for the U. S. at Mexico City . John Hennessy conquered Ricardo Tapia , schoolboy , and later , with less trouble , Gringo Kinsey . Wilmer Allison won a tough match from Alfonso Unda . In the doubles , Captain Tilden and Arnold N. Jones disposed of Unda and Kinsey . <P> U. S. Ambassador to Mexico Dwight Whitney Morrow watched some of the matches . Mexicans enjoyed the sizzling exhibition battles between U. S. players more than the Davis Cup walkaway.
