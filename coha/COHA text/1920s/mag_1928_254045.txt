WINTERSMOON-Hugh Walpole-Doubleday , Doran ( $2 ) . <P> " The Duchess of Wrexe " was dead , but London 's aristocracy remained , despite postwar cocktail sets and dole-fed Lower Classes . There were still the flower women at the fountain in Piccadilly Circus , still the lions and Nelson , still the fireplace sanctum under the stairs in St. James 's Club , still Big Ben and Curzon Street , still the higgledy piggledy of Shepherds Market . There was still Mrs. Beddoes , charwoman these many years to that kind Miss Janet and her beautiful sister Miss Rosalind , poor and snobbish . And today , being the wedding , was a holiday , for Mrs. Beddoes was going inside , inside St. Margaret 's , and not to watch as usual from outside the railings . No , " The Duke and Duchess of Romney request the pleasure of the company of Mrs. Beddoes on the occasion of the marriage of their son Wildherne Francis Poole to Janet , daughter of the late . . . . " Thus Janet was plunged irrevocably into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability for her adored sister . Unfortunately Rosalind had no use for such stability . She found Janet 's reception rather a dowdy party ; the room was very fine with its white walls , shining background to the family pictures , " . . . but nobody was very smartly dressed . Very few young people . No naked people at all . A great many old men with ribbons and orders . The Prime Minister , the Archbishop of Canterbury . Of course there would be lots of clergy . . . . " <P> Janet had married not only this house in Halkin Street , but also Wintersmoon with its Minstrel 's Gallery , and Queen Elizabeth 's bed , its three ghosts , its Spanish walk . But to Rosalind , Wintersmoon was merely the depths of Wiltshire : old house half shut up , woods , ponds , peacocks , Salisbury Plain in the distance . So Janet lost Rosalind ; and all that remained was a great emptiness . She could indeed have filled it with the traditional affairs of her mother-in-law the duchess-soup kitchens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was too modern for that kind of thing . So she fell miserably in love with her husband , although all he had asked , and still asked , of her was that she bear him companionship-and an heir . This she did . <P> But she found therein the more loneliness because her husband , passionately devoted to their small son , needed her less than ever . There was still Zanti , of the little curiosity shop , who dispensed philosophy to Janet much as he did , volumes ago ( Fortitude , published 1913 ) , to Peter Wescott . There was Peter himself , young and successful novelist . There was old John Beamister-Zoffany Club at a quarter to one precisely-who approved Janet 's quiet dignity . More important , there was the Duke , benevolently white-haired , who knew the bitterness of Janet 's love for his son . But none of these were enough-none of them needed her . Then suddenly the death of her child pitched Wildherne into depths of morbidity from which only Janet could save him . And at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , summoned her sister . At last Janet was needed ; had , indeed , to choose between the two needs .
