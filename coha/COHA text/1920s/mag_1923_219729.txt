A " micro-vivisection " apparatus so delicate that it enables scientists to dissect living cells has been perfected by Professor C. E. Tharaldsen , of the Department of Zoology , Northwestern University . It consists of a brass lever moved by three finely adjusted screws , manipulating special glass needles which can be brought to bear upon a cell suspended in a drop of nutrient fluid under the lens of the microscope . The needles , the essential part of the machine , are finer than hairs and are formed like a " J " or an " L. " The apparatus is superior to similar devices now in use , in that it is steadier . It requires much practice , however , to get a cell to lie still while a needle is being forced through it . The machine will make possible the study of the fundamental unit of living human protoplasm and its functions-a goal at which biologists have been aiming for years . Experiments are being conducted with minute eggs cut in two , to see whether each half will grow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be investigated with far-reaching significance to human welfare .
