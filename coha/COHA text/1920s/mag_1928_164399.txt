It was fearfully mixed up with politics but two things became apparent : 1 ) the President was against it ; 2 ) the Senate was for it . <P> It was a bill by Senator Charles Linza McNary of Oregon designed to meet the objections of President Coolidge and at the same time retain the favor of citizens who think that a thing called the Equalization Fee spells emancipation for Honest John Farmer . Just exactly what Honest John Farmer thinks about it is hard to tell , because he raises such a variety of crops with such various success that his attitude toward national farm relief legislation varies greatly and his many spokesmen often disagree . But the new McNary Bill , not to be confused with the oldtime McNary-Haugen Bill of which this was a 1928 model not yet hyphenated , applied to all farm products except meats , vegetables and fruits . In general , Honest John Farmer could be said to favor it . Hence the politics in Congress . <P> As passed , the McNary Bill provided : <P> 1 ) A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might borrow at 4% . <P> 2 ) A Federal Farm Board , composed of the Secretary of Agriculture and a member from each of the twelve U. S. Land Bank districts , appointed by the President . This Board was to administer the loan fund and help co-operative marketing associations to cope with surplus crops . <P> 3 ) Advisory councils for each farm commodity would be appointed by the Board . These councils would hold a veto power over the Board . <P> 4 ) Surveys would be made by the Board and its advisors to determine if and when a surplus of any commodity is on hand . <P> 5 ) To control such a surplus , the Board , through the co-operative marketing associations , would first loan money from the fund to help withhold the crop until domestic demand increased , or to " dump " the surplus abroad . In effect , the Government would thus be a buyer and seller of grain . <P> 6 ) Then , if the loan fund should be exhausted , the Board would fall back on the Equalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a surplus crop . The fairness of this scheme has never been questioned , since when a surplus crop occurs , all who have grown the crop have contributed to the surplus and helped drive the price down . The difficulties foreseen are in determining when a surplus exists and in deciding what is a " fair price . " <P> The McNary Bill passed the Senate 53 votes to 23 . Only seven Senators from west of the Mississippi voted or paired against it-Borah , Phipps , Shortridge , Warren , Smoot , Walsh , King . Of the Senate 's eight Presidential possibilities , the Messrs , Borah , Goff and Walsh were the only ones who stood against what Honest John Farmer is said to want . <P> At length , the new McNary Bill went from the Senate to the House , there to be wedded , if possible , to a new Haugen Bill and redebated . Many a non-believer in the bill would vote for it , observers guessed , if they felt sure the President was going to use his veto . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunists will make sure that the veto is not overridden by a two-thirds vote . Such has been McNary-Haugen history in the past .
