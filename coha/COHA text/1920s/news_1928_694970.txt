txt Major James Fitzmaurice , co-pilot of the German transatlantic airplane Bremen , which is derelict in the ice of Greenely Tsland , landed at Lake Ste. Agnes , twelve miles from here , at 3:28 this afternoon in a monoplane piloted by C. A. ( Duke ) Schiller . A mishap marked the arrival of : Tunes - Wide World .

Had the monoplane been going faster tragedy might well have marked the incident , but it was taxiing when the tail skid , cleaving the mush on the surface , penetrated the thin first layer of ice below and swung the plane around with the wind . It came to a dead stop , and mechanics had to shove it safely ' home . Miss Junkers Meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant , that the Irish aviator came today , bringing with him the first detailed story of the Bremen 's dramatic fight against storm and snow and fog , and the further information that , fat from abandoning his companions he had been sent out by them to brir 0 . back parts to repair the ship and then to fly it on again , perhaps first to Quebec , but ultimately to New York . Awaiting Major Fitzmaurice was Miss Herta Junkers , daughter of the builder of the Bremen . She had come up from New York especially to meet and talk with the Irish companion of the German fliers and to discuss with him the damage to the ship . Their meeting cleared up the fact that neither the messages from the fliers nor those from Miss Junkers had been transmitted successfully , leaving both sides puzzled and occasioning the long delay to the Bremen 's repair . Tonight Major Fitzmaurice is sleeping in a room in the office of the Transcontinental Airways at Lake St. Agnes , while the telephone is ringing incessantly for him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coy // Among the telegrams were many that puzzled and distressed him . One was from Grover Whalen , representing Mayor Walker of New York , saying that Major Fitzmaurice should not come on to New York alone and should not talk or write for the press . There were many others of similar purport . " I 'm not a swine , " Major Fitzmaurice exploded , aroused , first , that such a report should have been circulated , and , secondly , that it should have been believed . " I have n't abandoned my companions , as these correspondents seem to think . I have come out for necessary parts and I will take them back to the ship and help to fly her on again . " I came out because I was sent out , and I was sent out , first , because we could not get answers to our messages , and , second , because I could speak English and order a great many necessary things , such as shirts and soap socks Further reproduction prohibited without permission . CAPT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much with mud as it is with melting snow , taking batches of telegrams that already have begun to shower in upon him from both sides1 of the Atlantic . Army of Reporters There . Arrival of the Irish aviator was expected long before he came . Be- ! fore sunrise the army of reporters and photographers encamped here had started a long cavalcade over the snow-clad hills and the jingle of sleigh bells resounded through the wooded ravines and brought the wondering habitants of the countryside to their windows with amaze . But the morning passed without news of " Duke " Schiller and his distinguished companion , and this was puzzling to all , for the sun had risen clear above the broken line of humpbacked hills that rim the rounded lake . Here was ideal flying weather and with no word of any storm at Seven Islands it was not understood how and why the fliers were delayed . Noon still found no news of them , , although once one arriving newspaper plane aroused false hopes . Sighted Seventy-five Miles Away . But officials of tl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junkers when the telephone rang and word came from Seven Islands that Schiller would take off in the early afternoon . But 1 o'clock passed and then 2 , and sthi no word . At 2:20 a remote telephone operator flashed the news that the plane had been sighted over Millevache , seventy-five miles away . And from that point on it was followed up river until at last it became certain that only minutes would pass before he landed . It was exactly 3:25 when Schiller 's plane was seen above the tallest spruce upon the hills to the east of the lake . He circled once , examining the ice upon which lie hoped to land . Satisfied that it would hold him far out , although all the edge had melted and water there was visible , he came down with a swoop , skimmed the half-melted surface and turned to taxi in . It was just then that the accident happened that , had it occurred a few moments earlier , might have ended disastrously . Plane Fouled in Ice Crust . Seeing the airplane motionless out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics rushed across and , finding it fouled in the thin ice crust , cleared it and pushed it in . Out there on the ice , dressed in high , laced hiking boots that reached almost to her knees and wearing khaki riding breeches and white silk shirt , her hands thrust in the pockets of her long fur coat , Miss Junkers waited with Louis Couture , President , and Robert Cannon , director of the airways . She ran up to the plane , the men behind her , and then out stepped Major Fitzmaurice , wearing a scarlet flying jacket over his khaki uniform . He is a debonair man , still less than 30 , this air venturer , good-looking , about five feet five inches tall , slim and soldierly , and smiling . The greetings over and the inevitable picture making done , Major Fitzmaurice walked with Miss Junkers and the airways officials to the hangar and there went into conference with them , while blue coated policemen guarded the door . Several hours passed , and then Major Fitzmaurice announced that his business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the press . Fitzmaurice Adds to Story . To the representative of THE NEW YORK TIMES Major Fitzmaurice disclosed further details of his flight . " I 'm not a journalist but I 've tried to write down the story of our flight as I saw it , " he said producing from his tunic pocket almost bashfully , as an author might , his first effort . " This article , however , does n't tell it all . I hope to have others . Major Fitzmaurice 's story referred to is on Page 1 of THE TIMES . " Not only did we have an exciting take-off at Baldonnel , but 400 miles out from the Irish coast the engine sputtered . " Fortunately , this was due to no fault of its own , but owing to the gas mixture , and it kicked over and functioned perfectly thereafter . In fact , I have never flown a better ship or sat behind a better engine . " I want to speak of the wonderful hospitality shown by every one everywhere . I used to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a lesson from Canada . Starting with the old lighthousekeeper at Greenely Island , every one has opened their homes or offered to assist . " Miss Junkers Tells Plans . " What are your immediate plans ? " he was asked . " That I do n't know , " he replied . " Perhaps Miss Junkers can tell you . I have only just arrived , you know . " He turned , and Miss Junkers , happy now after days of anxiety ' or exact news of the Bremen and Byron von Huenefeld and Captain Koeh/ , said she had good news at last . " I learn from Major Fitzmaurice , to my great relief , " she said , " that the damage to the Bremen is less than I feared from the early , indefinite reports . " All the parts necessary to repair the ship are already on their way from New York . They should reach Murray Bay tomorrow night . Then they will be shipped by airplane to Greenely Island . There the damage to the Bremen will be repaired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to New York . I think the repairs to the Bremen will take only two days , " Burst Tire Caused Damage . Again Major Fitzmaurice took up the story . " The damage to the Bremen occurred in landing , " he said . " It was caused when a tire , cut by the broken ice , burst . This threw the ship down on her nose somewhat , and the propeller was bent and the under-carriage slightly damaged . " Our course , after we repair the ship , will depend largely on the weather . If we have to use skis it will be necessary for us to fly , probably to Quebec , to change them there for wheels that we may continue to New York . " We have had a wonderful reception in Canada . Last night at Clarke City the Irish residents there  --  and I was surprised how many of them there were  --  had out an Irish Republic flag , and in the clubhouse and cigarettes , of which we are in need . " But Major Fitzmaurice is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegrams of con-1 gratulation from Irish clubs and Irish people and from many officials ! of State . where they gave a reception to me was a streamer with the motto ' Erin Go Bragh . ' " No less expressive has been the assistance by the Canadian Transcontinental Airways , particularly by Mr. Couture and by Mr. Cannon . " I woule also like to pass on a word of congratulation from us to Costes and Lebrix . " Gladdened by Parents ' Greeting . Tonight felicitations began to pour in upon Major Fitzmaurice . Word came from T. A. Smiddy , the Irish Minister to the United States , that he had made his headquarters at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Montreal an : expected to take the flier on by special train to Washington . Major Fitzmaurice 's plan , however , will not make that possible . Most precious of the early greetings vn .. this : " Congratulations and love . We are proud of our gallant son . " FATHER AN ' ) MOTHER . " " That 's awfully decent , " Major Fitzmaurice said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without letting them know . " He said his father is Michael Fitzmaurice of Dublin . Another telegram was from " Cousin May . " Her name used to be May Reilly , the Major recalled , but she was married now , he thought , and living in Brooklyn .
