A PREFACE TO MORALS-Walter Lippmann-Macmillan ( $2.50 ) . <P> MID-CHANNEL-An American Chronicle-Ludwig Lewisohn-Harpers ( $3.50 ) . <P> In the chorus of U. S. philosophizing , somewhere between the deep notes of John Dewey and the loud guggling of the Menckens , two voices are raised-Walter Lippmann 's , young and clear , Ludwig Lewisohn 's , old and sad . The two have much in common . As Jews , both men can claim rich philosophical heritage . As conscious Americans , both incline to intense modernism . As intellectuals , both prescribe an adaptation of Greek philosophy . <P> " I want God-the absolute , " says Mr. <P> Lewisohn . " There is none . Very well . <P> Then something to take his place : permanent values somehow embodied and so to be served . " Embodied in Hellenism . <P> Lewisohn has found " all knowledge and worldly wisdom " ; embodied in Hebraism , " righteousness , humanity , and peace . ' ' These are the permanent values he has resolved to serve , believing that a synthesis of Hellenism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no place-Pauline Christianity which Mr. Lewisohn identifies with the divorce laws of New York and therefore with the root of his troubles . " My country and its Christian laws have no regard for love or virtue or the creative mind but give their support to legalized malignity and moral foulness if only these mouth the moral saws of the market-place . " <P> In Up Stream , Mr. Lewisohn began the spiritual autobiography of a Jew who , conventionally educated in South Carolina , flung his religious ardor into Methodism , progressed miraculously into free thought , attained at last an understanding of his Jewishness . Immersed for seven years in the cause of Zionism , he resumes in Mid-Channel the intimate personal chronicle of himself as a Jew wandering over the face of Europe . <P> Mr. Lewisohn 's meaning is often obscure , his message occasionally fanatical , but the consistent dignity and rhythm of his prose are hypnotic . Mr. Lippmann 's meaning , on the contrary , is always clear , his message pragmatic , his diction incisive , effective . <P> Says Lippmann : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the debacle of idealism at the end of the War is not their rebellion against the religion and moral code of their parents , but their disillusionment with their own rebellion . It is common for young men and women to rebel , but that they should rebel sadly and with out faith in their own rebellion , that they should distrust the new freedom no less than the old certainties-that is something of a novelty . " <P> In A Preface to Morals he analyzes that debacle in religion , in politics , art . He demonstrates that the humanism of the disillusioned sages tallies with modern psychology ; he predicates the elastic sort of humanism that will fit a changing age .
