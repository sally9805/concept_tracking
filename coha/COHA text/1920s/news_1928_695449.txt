txt In his talk of last Thursday to the Indiana bankers , the Governor of the Federal Reserve brought back to the controversy over its policies an atmosphere of common sense which had of late been conspicuously absent . When speculation in stocks became rampant last Spring and borrowings by stock brokers from the banks increased nearly $900 , - 000,000 within three months , the New York Reserve Bank made three successive advances in its official discount rate . It also sold $420,000,000 United States Government securities , thereby naturally taking up from the open market an equivalent sum which might otherwise have been placed in ordinary loans . While this was being done , the rate at which money could be borrowed on the Stock Exchange advanced from the January figure of 3% per cent . for demand loans and 4 for thirty days to the 10 per cent . call-loan rate of last July and this past week 's 7Y4 per cent . for threemonth loans . The high rates brought a considerable downward reaction in stocks , and Wall Street rushed at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock market . " When , therefore , speculation for the rise in stocks began again , the word was passed about that the Federal Reserve had been defeated , followed by confident declarations that the system 's hostile attitude had been perforce abandoned , and that thereafter it would cease to " meddle with the market . " This interpretation of the Reserve Board 's policies was of a piece with the Wall Street attitude of 1919 , when a fractional advance in the New York bank rate , during the climax of another excited speculation , caused angry talk of the need for Congressional inquiry into the system 's interference . Responsible Reserve Board authorities have repeatedly explained , but without making much impression on their critics , that the raising of the official rates was consequence and not cause of a tightening credit situation . Mr. MILLER of the Reserve Board publicly stated during a similar episode of 1925 that , while the Federal Reserve " was not established to provide a lifepreserver for the speculator , " nevertheless it never undertakes to " regulate stock or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve Bank 's board has lately declared with equal positiveness that control of the stock market is " the last thing that enters into its consideration " ; adding , however , that " when it becomes apparent that " Federal Reserve credit is being prin " cipally used for speculative purposes , " then it becomes the duty of the Fed " eral Reserve to limit that credit to our " commercial needs . " Governor YOUNG put the case with equal emphasis . A year ago , he points out , the structure of banking credit had already been expanded on the " inverted pyramid principle " with relation to the country 's gold reserve . Since then , that reserve had decreased $500,000,000 , yet bank credit was heavily increased ' and the private banks , as a result , enlarged by $500,000,000 , or more than 200 per cent. , their borrowings from the Federal Reserve . Citing these well-known facts , Mr. YOUNG stressed the absurdity of the assertion that the Reserve banks have created the present situation in credit . The Federal Reserve adjusted its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system had no control . " The result of the present wholly abnormal rates for loans on Stock Exchange collateral he did not prophesy , except to say that the Federal Reserve is in shape to protect commercial borrowers at reasonable rates for money , and that " unsound practices " which have been pursued in other quarters of the credit market " will in time correct themselves , " with possible damage to those who have indulged in them . Yet such disparity can hardly continue indefinitely . All past experience demon . strates that , in the long run , either the high rate must come down or the low rate must advance . Since , however , the abnormal rate for loans on Stock Ex. change collateral has had causes quit ( outside the policies of the Federal Re . serve , it is reasonable to suppose that correction of the unwholesome situatica in that branch of the credit market wit depend on removal of the influence ( making for credit inflation on Wal Street , not on a " change of policy " al the Reserve banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils whicl the Federal Reserve has been cora ? bating.
