 | WE LEFT Arusha for " the blue , " as they say out there , in February , our faces toward the unknown . This was our great day ! We were starting , full of hope and excitement , on our long trek into the deepest wilds of Tanganyika , formerly German East Africa , but now one of the mandated districts under the Versailles Treaty . Our objective was big game ? elephants , rhinos , hippos , and buffaloes ? and our hearts beat high .  | I have hunted our American big game in the Rockies and Labrador , but this was my first African adventure , and my nerves were atingle with excitement . Perhaps I might even bag an elephant ! Our party of five , three men and two women , was accompanied by one hundred and seventy servants , all natives . Even a single hunter does not go into the African jungle without dozens of porters , for everything has to be carried on human backs or heads ? food , tents and beds , guns , ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gari led off the march . The gari , a single-wheeled bush cart of the natives , was a frequent refuge for us during our journey across the veldt . It was exciting sport to be trundled bumpily along by our fierce-looking but really amiable porters , and even more so to be carried over the streams and through the swamps on their glistening black backs . It took me a day or two to become accustomed to the strangeness of it all , and to the barbaric appearance of our entourage . Often I smiled at fleeting thoughts of what the people at home would think could they see us treking along , five khakiclad figures in the midst of almost naked , grotesque-looking savages . Like every one else who travels in strange lands I soon learned to discard many preconceived ideas as to the manners , customs and dress of these African natives . With their gaily painted shields and spears and bows and arrows they are magnificent , rather than terrifying . They are honest according to their lights , willing workers , and amiable even under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blankets or hides ? those curious prints in our old geographies always showed them so . Instead , the native flings his blanket % hide carelessly ? or not at all ? over one . houlder to fall as it will . Some of them are content with a hat , others with a waist-deep smock ; anything so long as they have a patch of covering somewhere about them for adornment . In spite of their lack of attention to clothes , they give much thought to decorating themselves , and will spend hours smearing their bodies with red clay and castor oil in intricate patterns . When it rains they wear skull caps of skins tied under their chins in the vain hope of keeping this prized and expensive clay from being washed off , and on treks they wear beautifully beaded belts from which hang , in the back , little heart-shaped skins which serve as sofa cushions when they sit down to rest . The adornment of their ears is a life work ; distended with blocks of wood from birth , and hung with everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grotesque . Our men were fully armed with spears and bow and arrows and , comical indeed , dashing little swagger sticks such as the British army officer carries . As their loads grew heavier , the spears and bows were flung aside , but nothing could separate them from their swagger sticks . Watching them , during the first stages of our journey , when we were crossing a flat , uninteresting country , was an unfailing amusement . Willing and good-natured , they sang , laughed , and chattered in their soft tongue , very like Italian , as they plodded their fifteen miles a day , carrying from fifty to seventy pounds on their heads . The day we reached the banks of Lake Manyara , we knew that the second chapter of our adventure had begun . Here , at last , we had come to the jungle , one of the most gloriously beautiful places in the world . We rested under palm and baobab trees , those giants of biblical fame , often measuring fifteen feet in diameter . Our carpets were white lilies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimosa and flowering tropic bushes , stirring under the flutterings of the startled parrots , gay in their feathery coats of scarlet , orange and green . And near by the blue waters of the lake were bordered with flocks of the pink flamingo . Having been warned that the forests here were filled with rhinos and other big game we marched with much circumspection from the lake toward our next camp on t ? e Lembolve River . But the only creatures we saw for all our care were quaint , painted giraffes , and ostriches , marabou , storks ,  | egret , pure white and dazzling , and flashes of the great , crimson-crested cranes . Through the air flew hundreds of birds gay in color , far different from the painted orange and scarlet imitations on sale in our cities . And monkeys ! Every kind and size , from the tiniest , chattering fur ball to great troops of baboons with their huge ruffs of hair and their fierce , doglike faces . I shrank from these creatures at first ; death , and a horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . But it seems they never attack a traveler unless molested . I fell asleep , that night , under the shadow , of the great Escarpment . This gigantic rock cliff , towering thousands of feet above the veldt , cuts . through the heart of Central Africa and helps to form the Eastern Rift Valley . And we were to climb to its very top . THE sun was barely visible next morning when we broke camp and started on our steep and narrow , trail , up the well-nigh unclimbable sides of sheer rock . It led us round jagged corners close to the overhanging edges of deep precipices down which we did not dare to look , and on past masses of boulders placed just where they meant the greatest danger . It was amazing to see how dexterous our porters were in carrying their loads over this heartbreaking trail . Four thousand feet above our starting point we had our breakfast , looking down on a view of surpassing grandeur . There , thousands of feet below us , was the deep blue of Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains we had spent the last week in crossing , and in the distance the peaks of Essimingor and Meru , the massive summit of Toolmalasin , and still farther away , the great dome of Kilimanjaro ( the Devil Mountain ) floating like a snow island in the deep azure of the sky . Big game or not , this view was indeed worth all the hazards of the climb . Some of us would have liked to remain a day or two in this inspiring spot , but we were : - ' headed for Ngoro-Ngoro , the greatest extinct volcano in the world , and must be on our way . The jungle again claimed us , and for two days we tramped down trails worn by countless generations of jungle animals . We had chosen our time well , for we were in the season between the big and little rains , and every plant and flower had reached its absolute perfection . Tramping steadily on through tangled fields and down paths barely discernible under the low-branched trees an arm 's length above our heads , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bean trees and purple veronica . We walked for hours walled in on both sides by these fragrant blooms . It was difficult to realize that we were really hunters of big game ! Flowering trees and bushes , and the sweet , heady fragrance of lilies and forget-me-nots did not fit into the picture with hippos and rhinos . During these wondrous days we were nearing our journey 's end . The hour came when our trail brought us at last to the big , open plains in the center of the extinct volcanic region ? the Highlands of the Great Craters . Here , nearly eight thousand feet in the air , we made our camp , and bitterly cold it was ! Here , also , we got our first rhino , and I shot at an old bull eland ? but missed him . This first taste of blood thrilled and excited us all , and we were full of expectancy as we started next day , shivering in an icy Scotch mist , for the crater of Ngoro-Ngoro , the goal of our expedition . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crater 's rim . No one spoke . We were thousands of feet above the sea , and as far as the eye could reach stretched this tremendous mass of volcanic formation . An unbroken ring of precipitous cliffs formed a complete circle , the far ones lost in the pinkish blue haze twelve miles distant from where we stood . The sides of @# these cliffs , which once held the huge lake of boiling lava , were green with verdure and forest trees , and down , far down at the bottom , instead of fire , was a wonderful plain of emerald green with the gleaming waters of Lake Magad as its center jewel . The scene of all this beauty was to be our happy hunting-ground for a fortnight . To tell the truth , we were somewhat sceptical about game when we saw the glories of this crater spread before us . So much beauty and game , too ! Impossible , we thought . Back in Arusha the natives claimed that herds of vildebeest gnu ) , 75,000 strong , hartebeest , zebras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaming round this crater . As our eyes grew accustomed to the view and we looked intently toward the great plain , our scepticism died . All these animals and more were standing literally in masses before us ! It seemed as though the whole plain was peopled with these wild creatures , standing side by side . Seldom has such a sight been seen by the eager el-es of any hunter . Making our way down the sides of the crater , we crossed the open spaces surrounded by these thousands and thousands of almost fearless creatures , who went on feeding , scampering : and playing regardless of us . It was uncanny . On our crossing , we discovered the reason for the throngs of animals ? the bottom of the crater was one solid carpet of luxuriant clover . No wonder it was such a popular feeding ground ! We had been staging one-night camps throughout our journey , but Ngoro-Ngoro was to be our home for some fourteen nights , and our camp became a thing of wonder and comfort . It is extraordinary how comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the course of an hour or two , a little model village sprang up . There were cook houses and shelters for the natives , and shambas or native huts of reed for each one of us , all thatched a foot deep with grass , under which we could sit bare-headed at noonday in a cool and perfect shade . . Our personal servant , having unpacked our belongings and arranged them to be ready to our hands at a moment 's notice , now appeared in snow-white garments that might have been nightgowns . Atop their kinky , black heads they wore turbans of beautiful gold and colored Indian brocades . And the food ! From very good but simple fare , we now had elaborate dinners of many courses and delightful surprises . Our wily old cook , whom we could bribe to any form of excess by the promise of a cigarette , gave us most wonderful roasts and stews of all kinds of game , cold buffalo and rhino tongue , and , as great delicacies , steaks of ostrich or slices of elephant trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be remembered . The next morning , as two of us were crossing the crater of NgoroNgoro with several Massai warriors as guides , my gun-bearer stopped us and pointed to the plain below . There , in solemn grandeur , walking in single file , were three monster lions , splendidly maned . Nothing more magnificent could be imagined than those fearless beasts , their heads held high and their bodies rigidly erect as they moved steadily on their way . Instantly we were all excitement . Here was our first opportunity to bring down a monarch of the jungle . Our guides stepped into the background to give us free range , and my companion fired . His shot was a telling one , for it killed the leading lion instantly . As the creature crumpled downward , a second shot laid low another of the trio , wounded but full of fight and resistance . The lion fell near a clump of bushes , and before we could get another shot at him , he had dragged himself into the thicket . We could hear him thrashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . No experienced hunter will follow any wounded animal into heavy underbrush where he would be atthe mercy of a maddened beast at bay , and so strategy must take the place of recklessness . Being a woman , and this being my first experience , Iwas ordered to a spot on the side of the cliff where I could watch operations and keep my gun trained on one side of the thicket . In the meantime the men crept cautiously up to the edge of the lion 's hiding place , each one a few paces from the other ; and fired steadily into the bushes until all growling ceased . Then , waiting a few moments to be sure that danger was over , the guides rushed in and brought forte our second trophy . As might have been expected , while all this was going ' on , the third lion made good his escape ! THE Massai are wonderful lion hunters , using only their shields and spears , and the chiefs promised us an organized hunt the next day . So while we wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase , we forced ourselves to keep jungle hours , which are early ones . Wakened before dawn by the noisy chattering of our natives , we were on our way just as the sun tipped the eastern edge of the crater with a luminous glow . We were headed , of course , toward danger , for during the day the lion hides in the deep ravines that tear apart the walls of the cliffs , and to bring one down we must first draw them from their secret sanctuaries . These gorges , rock strewn , overgrown with tangled undergrowth , and roofed with impenetrable vines and foliage , are the result of the terrific rain storms that visit this country . Torrents of water pouring down the cliffs wear away the rock and form , in time , ideal hiding places for these ferocious beasts . Past ravine after ravine we followed our experienced guides , and oh , how I wanted eyes in the back of my head , for my very skin tingled with a sense of the danger , and my elbows twitched . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his lair at our defenseless backs ? Our suspense , far from ending , was increased when our Massai slowed down and pointed to the darkest , most dangerous ravine of all . Here we prepared ourselves for a battle royal . The thirty hunters , stalking stealthily up the sides of the cliff , formed a circle round the den . Singing and chanting their war songs , screaming and whistling , crashing their spears on their shields and jangling pieces of metal they had strung around their knees , the Massai slowly closed in the circle , beating up the bushes as they went . As the circle narrowed in , two lionesses plunged out from a deep gully . One bolted up a slender trail winding up the cliff . There she encountered a wall of shields and spears , as the warriors stood their ground against her . With superb courage she threw herself against this wall of spears , only to be beaten off ; then followed the most frightful yelling , roaring , and hissing , and a crash and thud of fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came wildly tearing down the cliff and disappeared into the bushes . We now turned to hunt the other one , who had made off . into one of the ravines . The warriors beat around through the bushes for some time , but with no success , when suddenly there was a deafening roar , a rush and hiss , and with a great leap the lioness charged full at one of our party who was standing only a few yards away . It was all over in a second , for he jumped to one side just in time . There was not a moment to shoot , and she missed him by only a few inches . The Massai could not follow her into the underbrush , as they can use their nine-foot spears only in the open , where they have the full swing of their arms , so all we could do was to keep up firing . A moment later she tried to bolt for the open , but was shot down instantly . We were crowding forward to see our dead heroine when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose presence we had been entirely ignorant . Fortunately the men were ready , and she was shot dead before she could turn to attack us . The lure of the lions proved too much for us , so we changed our comfortable camping place for one on the western side of the crater , to be nearer them ? and we were ! They roared so close to us all night that even the fires seemed little protection , and when I wakened in the morning I found eight of the Massai hunters sleeping on the floor round my bed ! These bold warriors had crept into my tent for safety ! But our stay in the crater was not all devoted to lion hunting ; there were other animals to be considered , and of them all the rhinos kept us most busy . One morning , left at home to rest and darn my stockings while the others went off eager for another lion , I had an exciting experience . Sitting on a knoll under -a tree , busily mending a jagged heel , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my gun-bearer rushed to me , crying : " Memsahab , rhino over there . " He pointed to a spot about a half-mile away . Jumping up and grabbing my rifle , I followed the excited bearer . Beyond a little rise in the ground we saw the huge and ugly creature wandering aimlessly across the plain . There was not a bush nor a tree of any kind to hide behind , and I felt an intense sense of helplessness , not having the slightest idea of how much killing such a creature would require . Recalling that the sight of a rhinoceros is poor , although his senses of smell and hearing are particularly acute , I crept up slightly from behind , and when within about eighty yards of him fired at his heart . To my amazement he spun round two or three times and fell to the ground . But this did not satisfy me , forI had been fed for many weeks on tales of hunters killed by wounded rhinos . So even with my rhino lying before me I took no chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great , hulking body . Examination later proved that my first shot killed him . This first rhino was a tremendous event to me , but as time passed we became so accustomed to these great creatures that we hardly noticed them ! And they apparently accepted us , for frequently they would walk out on the slopes just beyond our camp site and disport themselves in the light of the setting sun in the most amusing fashion . Like all jungle animals , the rhino comes to life as the day dies . OUR return journey was crowded with adventure . In the first place our food ran low , and to avert disaster we sent porters on to Mbulu for supplies , while we followed slowly after them to a camp on the Matete river . The day came when our own food and the Pocho ( corn for the natives ) was completely exhausted , and we faced a serious situation . There was but one thing to do , go after hippopotami , for with two hundred natives to feed , the smaller animals are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous in the black pools around the lake , and naturally expected to bring in at least one . But this was not so easily done , for during the war the German army stationed in this district killed them so incessantly for food that they had become very shy , and though we stalked them with the greatest care we did not even get a shot . Fortunately we did get an antelope or two , which helped to save the day . In spite of our anxiety , we reveled in the beauty of our surroundings . The pools , themselves , made a veritable paradise with their wealth of palm trees and moss and creepers of every kind . Feathery papyrus twenty feet high waved gracefully in the @#  | breezes with a delicacy and elegance greater than that of any plant I know . Here the jungle was well-nigh impassable , for monkey vines and moss garlands bound the trees and bushes so tightly together that only the labyrinth of hippo trails from three to four feet wide made it possible for us to get about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little streams smothered in dense plants and verdure and filled with little parrokeets and monkeys . It was cool and dark with the mystery of the dense jungle over all . In fact , everything was there but the hippos . Food we must have , and so we moved our camp the next day further down the Matete river to the lake shores . Of course there were brush bucks and ostriches around us , but these do not go far among two hundred savages who can consume a ton of meat with no trouble at all . OUR first night on the lake brought us luck . Driven by our need we cove he ground for miles , and finally , ten miles from camp , one of our party shot a hippopotamus in a stream . As the stream was shallow , the hippo rose in about an hour . Waiting for it to rise was somewhat tedious , but when the great , dark hulk came to the surface , we were ready with our ropes , and all lent a hand at pulling it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I left them to return to the main camp , they were a savage sight , sitting around the dead animal , cutting off hunks of flesh with the knives they wore on their belts , and toasting them on the ends of sticks in the fires which they had built in a circle around them to keep off the beasts of prey . In my innocence I imagined that when I returned the following morning with extra porters to carry back meat for the rest of us , there would be plenty left . But at dawn on my return there was not an ounce left on that hippo , though it must have weighed nearly a ton ! We learned our lesson , and that afternoon , when we shot four hippos down the river , we brought our own meat back most carefully . For three or - four days we had nothing to eat but hippo steaks which , though delicious in flavor , were so tough that it was difficult to swallow them . Our joy can be imagined when we saw the porters filing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt now took us along trails tunneled under trees and creepers by animals going from water hole to water hole for hundreds of years-trails through which we often had to crawl on our hands and knees . At one point , as we were proceeding for the time in upright fashion , the native guide ran back to tell us that there was an old cow rhino with a " tote " ( baby ) lying on the trail , but as she had a poor horn , we probably would not care to shoot her unless from necessity . The leader of the expedition went on ahead , and I stayed behind at a fork of the trail , while he tried to put her out of the way . Suddenly there was a shot and , as I stood rifle in hand with my gun-bearers listening intently for what might happen , a huge giraffe came galloping by , missing me by a foot . Then , without warning , as we stood in supposed safety , we heard a crash among the trees but a yard or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhino to be charging down the trail , for this is their habit , but unfortunately , whether she saw me or merely from a desire to get into the thick forest , she swerved from the trail . She and I met behind the bush . Luckily she struck me only with her shoulder , flinging me back into the scrub . I was badly torn and scratched , as every bush and tree and plant in Africa bears a thorn of some kind , but otherwise unhurt . My face was streaming with blood , and when my two savages picked me up with the greatest tenderness and care , they insisted on washing my face with my handkerchief and the water from the drinking bottle . It all happened in a-second . There had never been a moment in which to realize the beast was on me , or time to shoot . Later she was killed by one of the party . This experience brought home more forcefully than any preceding happening the dangers surrounding us every step of our way , and added to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all had the feeling that anything might happen at any moment . The following morning , as we were making our way inch by inch through the tangled undergrowth we heard a loud snort , an entirely new variety to me , that meant buffalo . The man in the lead disappeared from sight , and the rest of us held back to give him full opportunity to shoot alone . Soon came a shot and a great crashing through the - timber as the buffalo herd came rushing madly toward me . I climbed a tree which , luckily , was near , and they passed to one side , but I then and there came to the conclusion that the form of hunting hardest on the nerves is that of staying back in the density of the forest where you can not possibly see what is going on , while some one else goes on ahead to shoot ! All this happened between breakfast and lunch , but there was more to follow . As we were eating , a great noise between a bellow and a - shriek sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tembo , Tembo . " At last I had heard an elephant trumpet , a sound I had come so far to hear . We paid no attention to the interruption but - resumed luncheon , for man must be fed . But again the native rushed in to tell us that there was a whole herd of elephants drinking just below us in the river . No more food for us ! We left everything and crept as stealthily as mortal can down toward the ravine , for the elephant , though the largest and most powerful of all the animals , is the most shy and easily scared . One whiff of a human being or one crack of a twig in an unknown manner , and they are off instantly , leaving that district for good . Down in the very bottom of a beautifully wooded ravine were twenty or thirty happy elephants , drinking and throwing the water with their trunks over themselves and their companions , playing just like school-boys in a water hole . We were not more than eighty yards from them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fairly safe , and we watched them for hours . At last , toward evening , they wound slowly and majestically up the opposite side , feeding and tearing up the trees with their trunks as they went , until they disappeared in single file over the edge of a hill . We did not shoot , because though there were several whose tusks we thought weighed sixty to eighty pounds apiece , we had only a license for one elephant each . At that time we innocently supposed it would not be too hard to get a hundred-pound tusker . CAMP life in the African wilds speedily one to expect the unexpected . Unconsciously one 's nerves become very tense , for crawling cautiously through labyrinths of trees and undergrowth , with the thought that death may lurk behind every bush , is no joke . And the dark hours of the night are the worst , for the blazing camp fire or the lanterns placed in the tent doorway do not always terrify the creatures . There was the night when , awakening with a start , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an uncanny terror . Looking out through the open flaps of my tent , the air seemed filled with great , gray , moving shapes passing phantom-like before my eyes . This silent , moving wall completely obscured the sky . Of a sudden there was a frightful crashing sound , the earth shook , and the air was rent with a wild screaming and trumpeting . Breathless , I realized that a herd of elephants , scenting our mules , was stampeding in terror  | through the camp . They rushed through trees and undergrowth , annihilating everything before them . That no one was killed was one of those miracles that sometimes happens . The next morning we measured their tracks and found that the maddened animals had missed my tent by a bare twenty feet . One of our party slept all through the racket and was much annoyed next morning when he heard what he had missed ! At the . end of several days of nerve-racking strain , during which we had neither eaten a meal nor slept undisturbed a night through , I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For days we had lived so continuously with our loaded rifles in our hands or across our knees that for one , I felt the effects ! Deserted by every one , peace seemed my portion as I sat in my pajamas and dressing gown thinking of my children . Peace ? It could not last . My first letter was barely started when several natives hurried to my tent with tales of a huge rhino bearing down on the camp . As we were now in the elephant country our camp was cowpletely hidden in a hollow of the ground amoFg a clump of shrubs . We had no fire on account of smoke , and our natives were commanded to keep as quiet as possible . Evidently the rhino knew nothing of our presence , and was out just for pleasure . I did not want to shoot him , having already killed the two allowed on my license , but the camp must be defended . Crawling out , I sat behind an ant hill , and soon the great monster came in view , strolling along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing his head about and whisking his tail . For an hour he played about the camp , wandering up to within fifty yards of the tents , then away a little bit as though hesitating about what to do . This he did time and again until finally he wandered off entirely and I returned to my letters . PEACE ? Rest ? Only a few minutes later the natives came in to tell me that another rhino was heading down the trail toward us . Again I took my place behind the ant hill and , rifle in hand , waited for another hour while this second visitor browsed around and amused himself . Every moment I feared I would have to shoot , but he , too , changed his mind and made off down the trail . Surely this is the end of them , I said to myself , once more returning to my letters . But rhinos evidently believe in the rule of three , for within ten minutes I was called out the third time to face the most progressive rhino of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to within ten yards of the bushes where we stood . My gunbearers urged me to shoot him at once . so great is the fear of the natives for these animals , but I was determined to do so only in the last extremity . Once he came so near that the moment seemed to have come , . when my mule , who was also hidden in the bushes , suddenly brayed long and hard . I do not think that that poor rhino had ever heard such a sound before , for he certainly had the scare of his life . Jumping his whole four or five thousand pounds at once into the air and uttering terrified squeals ; he ran toward the forest as hard as his little , short legs would carry him . Needless to say , it was with a feeling of real relief on my part that we left the elephant camp in the great virgin forest of Oldeani the following day to go down to the lower and safer plains . Our trek led us to mountains where we hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its ferocity and for being one of the most difficult animals to kill . On our way one of the party shot a magnificent rhino with a horn twenty-eight inches long , and two giant forest hogs . This was , of course , exciting and satisfactory in a way , but we wanted to add at least one buffalo to our bag . At dawn one morning we came upon a large herd sleeping in a little clearing in a swamp . I shot one , only wounding it , however , and it made off into the forest with the herd . We crept along inch by inch looking for the wounded animal , for he could not go far , we thought . We tried to pierce every thicket , for the buffalo , when wounded , has the vicious habit of circling round and coming up back of the hunter . Rounding a clump of bushes , one of the gun-bearers pointed hastily behind us . There , within fifteen feet of us , were two glittering , ferocious eyes , the body of the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation ? we all fired at once , and the animal fell dead . Our last thrill came several days out from Arusha . We had several uneventful days until one afternoon we came to a group of excited natives pointing to some black spots on the ground . A gruesome tale they told . The spots were human blood . Just a few hours before our arrival a man-eating lion had carried off one of their friends while he was cooking his food over a great fire among his companions . This was a daring and hungry lion , indeed . He did the three things lions are supposed never to do : to attack unprovoked in the daytime , to approach a fire , or to attack any one in a group of men . This lion , leaping on the man from behind , had seized him by the neck and borne him off into the bushes . There had been nothing but a sudden streak , a shriek , and that was all . We determined to camp on the spot and get the man-eater that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bushes for bait , sat up in a tree until daylight watching for the lion 's return . Toward morning he worked his way to the bait , but it was such a black night they never got a shot , and we left the spot next day with no man-eater to our credit . SAFELY arrived in Arusha , my mind dwelt continually on those highly prized creatures , the black-maned lions of British East Africa , and I laid plans to get one before leaving for home . In the meantime one of the men suggested that we try our luck at the elephants which were said to be heading in great numbers along the Mara River . As our time was limited and the hunting of this wily beast is an art entirely in itself , we took Mr. Judd , a white hunter , who was also on Colonel Roosevelt 's expedition , with us , and induced our friends , the Massai , to act as trackers to locate the best bulls in the shortest space of time . It was not until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tusker we were looking for . The law of the land of Africa is that the man who draws first blood claims the animal , as every one is supposed to shoot immediately at wounded beasts , for they are so terribly dangerous . There had been many discussions in the camp as to who should draw the first blood of the first elephant , and being the only woman hunter , the men insisted that this honor should be mine . " The big tusker scented us as we came near him , and started lumbering off . I got two shots into his hindquarters , but he continued his trip into the dense jungle . The other hunters and the Massai followed after him , leaving me to await results . An hour later they sent me a note asking me to come and bring some food , for when you are once following a wounded elephant the chase may go on for days . Coming up with them after a two-hour hike , they told me the wounded animal was somewhere within a few yards of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet on any side . It was imperative , if we were to get our beast , to work our way into the thickets . Again I had to remain in the background while the others crept forward on their hands and knees for perhaps twenty yards . A shot and a terrific crashing of timber told me the elephant was off again , and evidently in the other direction from where I stood . It seemed to me that ten or-fifteen minutes had passed when my gun-bearer touched me on the arm and pointed in front .  | There , not fifteen feet away , frightfully wounded by four or five shots , stood the great animal , , not moving a muscle , but savagely rolling his little eyes in every direction trying to locate the danger . Evidently he had scented me and then , circling round , drifted back through the forest without making a sound . It was a ticklish moment , and I did not know whether or not to shoot . Then , too , the hunters might be right behind him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang out , the tusker turned , and with raised trunk in air and his great ears forward , he charged madly at the men coming up on the other side . Another shot and he fell dead a yard or two from their feet . Our natives and the Massai were wild with delight , and in a moment hundreds of natives seemed to emerge from ground , the trees , and every other spot . It is a great event in the lives of these people when one of the big animals is killed . They are their natural enemies , and from the time a man is born until he dies there is never a moment when he is not apprehensive of being killed by one of them , or having his cattle , which are his wealth , destroyed . Not being allowed guns , they use arrows and spears poisoned with a paste , they distill from the bark of a tree . This is so deadly that it kills a man in a few moments , a buffalo or rhino in fifteen or twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The astonishing thing is that while the heart is paralyzed , the flesh remains unharmed and fit to eat . However , killing at such close range as this is a precarious job and seldom attempted except as an absolute necessity and in selfdefense . Therefore it is with the greatest joy that they see one of these fierce monsters lying dead before them . Of course , the elephant was nominally mine , and so they decorated me with grass and flowers and lifted me on their shoulders , and while a circle of warriors stood round dancing and chanting my praises , they carried me round and round the dead beast . ? Then began the arduous task of cutting out the seventy-six pound tusks , which meant a very fine elephant , for nowadays the average hunter is satisfied with tusks of fifty or sixty pounds . When we left the spot the natives had already lit their fires and started preparations for eating the animal . We were most anxious to get another elephant , but though we hunted for days and days , those few shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we did not get another chance . AT LAST the day came when my longed-for black-maned trophy promised to become a reality . Following our experience with the tuskers , the rest of the party returned to Arusha , and , taking the necessary natives , I journeyed further down the Mara river to the lion country . Camping in a favored spot , my guides prepared for a night killing , or rather several nights of waiting . The first step was to build a little platform in a thorn tree about fifteen feet from the ground , planned so that the limbs and leafy branches would hide me from view . On this platform I was to remain from sunset to daylight , for no one dares leave the tree after dark comes and the forest creatures begin their own hunt . Then came the bait . For this I killed a zebra , which our oxen dragged around in a circle of perhaps five miles to entice the lions from their lairs . At the end , we chained the dead beast securely to stakes driven into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon about five o'clock I would climb into the tree with many warm coats and provisions enough for a light supper , prepared to spend the night . These nights in the treetop gave me a better knowledge of the African jungle than anything else had done . Watching the great-maned lions , lionesses and their cubs , the little jackals , and the packs of hyenas from my vantage point was the most enthralling experience of my whole trip . The nights were almost as bright as day , for the moon gave a wondrous white light , and I could see animals of many sorts approach from quite a distance . Studying their idiosyncrasies and habits made the hours of waiting pass quickly , but what I wanted was a good shot and a " kill . " Of all the thrills of the trip , there was something peculiarly different in the thrill that coursed through me when my first black-mane fell before my shot . Lying on my platform , every nerve taut , strai$ing to hear the faint grunts of an approaching lion , my nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly below me . The beast had come up from the other side without my seeing him . When I fired at him , he fell , but whether dead or only wounded , I did not know . And assuredly I did not descend from my safe perch to find out ! LIGHTING a kerosene lantern attached to a long rope , I hung it from the tree over the lion , to scare away the hyenas . This is a necessary part of lion-hunting , for the hyenas , hideous creatures , wait eagerly for their chance at any dead or wounded animal . The light is supposed to frighten them and other animals away . But not always ; the night when , after several false alarms , I succeeded in killing my second lion , his mate came boldly out of the forest and jumped over the dead beast , knocking the lantern over ; then , roaring defiantly , she made off into the bushes . My lamp proved a potent power , however , that first night , for when day came and I climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unmutilated before me . But I was not always so successful . The fourth night of my vigil three great beasts stood for fifteen minutes under my platform , roaring so continuously that I felt I never would hear again . The sound was so appalling that I feared my ear drums would crack . And when they ceased , the hyenas started in , and their " laughing " was the most horribly bloodcurdling sound I had ever heard . The next night no lion came near me , and these cowardly scavengers came out in force to attack my bait . After it had been completely eaten to the last vestige of bone , they continued to surge round and round my tree until morning . Their eyes glittered in the moonlight like strings of marvelous emeralds and no words can describe their cackles and shrieks . The last touch that froze my blood was their satanical way of grinding their teeth and looking up at me , which told me that I was the bait they were waiting for ! Each night in my tree-top perch held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the tragic night when , unable to fire a shot because of the distance , I was forced to look on at a battle to the death between a wounded lion and two hyenas . There was nothing to be done but sit gripping my hands and praying for the end to come quickly . For a terrible hour and a half battle raged and then came silence . This ghastly experience taught me one lesson ; never would I shoot at a lion unless I was absolutely sure of hitting a vital spot . Better miss a beast entirely than run the chances of his being wounded and so falling a prey to the cowards of the jungle . In the end my bag included seven of the jungle monarchs , one having a beautiful allblack mane , while the others were well streaked with black . Each of these man-killing creatures had fallen to my shot from my tree platform , and they spelled many nights of terror on my part . But it was well worth the price ! The morning following the seventh " kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much tension and excitement , we broke camp and trekked toward Nairobi . And so ended my African adventure .
