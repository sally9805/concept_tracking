Naval Building <P> Sirs : <P> I can not refrain from expressing to you my satisfaction at the eminently fair and understanding manner in which the naval building program was presented to your readers in your issue of Feb. 20 , 1928 . ( Slight errors in the biographical paragraph concerning Admiral Hughes are of course of no consequence . ) <P> J. D. MOORE <P> Lt. Comdr . U. S. N. <P> Hydrographic Office <P> Navy Department <P> Washington , D. C. <P> Let Lt. Comdr . Moore specify the " slight errors . " - ED . <P> Bruce Barton School <P> Sirs : <P> In your Feb. 6 issue , under " Religion " you find fault with a certain miner for the feeling he evinces towards ministers and their enviable financial position . <P> The miner sang : " How much money does a clergyman need , for reading out the gospel and mumbling the creed ? He lives at home and he does n't pay rent-if he gets a plugged nickel , he 's a very lucky gent . " - ED . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by dentists and other professional men as compared with that of ministers . <P> I am afraid that , in the minds of many readers , this attitude will place TIME in the ranks of Philistines and others of the Bruce Barton school who interpret the world 's most cherished illusions in the light of their pragmatical souls . <P> Christ , during his entire ministry , so continuously insisted that his disciples should give up the things of this world that there can be no reasonable doubt entertained as to his meaning . <P> And what , pray , has the excellence of Dr. Jefferson 's preaching and his freedom " from garbled sensationalism " got to do with the remuneration he receives . Did St. Paul , St. Francis , St. Ignatius claim return from their saintliness ? <P> Of course not . . . . No , this miner you quote may not have been actuated by the highest principles , but in the light of the four gospels , I confess , he 's not so far wrong . <P> K. OLIPHANT <P> Los Angeles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Having been an interested reader of TIME for several years I feel sure that you will be glad to correct an erroneous statement made on p. 30 your issue for Feb. 13 , 1928 , wherein you state under caption " Bank Robbers , " that two innocent Mexicans were shot in front of a Bank at Midland for the sake of the rewards offered by the T. B. A. <P> These Mexicans were shot in Stanton , Texas , 20 miles east of Midland and their assailants are now under indictment for murder . This press statement has given our town some rather unwelcome publicity , your part of which I am sure you will be glad to rectify . <P> I am a former subscriber but for the past year have been buying TIME at the newsstand and sometimes I often get there too late to get a copy . I enclose my check for $5.00 for a year 's subscription . <P> D. L. HUTT <P> Midland , Texas . <P> Prescient <P> Sirs :             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
