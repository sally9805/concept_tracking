HAVE you joined the Frankenstein chorus ? It is quite the thing to do nowadays . From pulpit , rostrum , editorial chair , the cadence comes , in swelling volume ; and the burden of the song is to the effect that man has become the slave of his machines , even as Doctor Frankenstein was overwhelmed by the monster he created . Here , for example , is the Rev. Henry P. Frost : " In this age of the machine , the shadow of the Frankenstein monster that we have made falls with sinister menace across the upward - reaching pathway of the race . We are all classified , standardized , regimented ; while our human life and individuality are stifled and dwarfed . " Professor Harry Elmer Barnes , while not a member in good standing , nevertheless foregathers with the boys from time to time : " Machines ... either the greatest boon to humanity thus far achieved , or a Frankenstein monster ultimately destined to confuse and finally destroy his baffled creator . " Mr. Austin Freeman holds that man without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loses independence and self-reliance ; he is readily subjected to regimentation ; his sense of personal liberty is abated , while his aesthetic sensibilities are blunted and debased . Mr. J. B. S. Haldane , with his usual charming originality , will have nothing to do with the Frankenstein choir as such , but instead trots out for our inspection a Demogorgon : " Has mankind released from the womb of matter a Demogorgon which is already beginning to turn against him , and may at any moment hurl him into the bottomless void ? " Sir Philip Gibbs allows us only the difficult choice between killing all scientists and completely reforming man 's moral and intellectual nature . I am not a machine tender , but first and last I encounter a good many mechanisms in a day 's march . As the chorus swells , it occurs to me that , before beginning to analyze serfdom in the general body politic , it might be well to determine how far I am myself a slave . The first thing that I hear in the morning is a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obey . But if I do not feel like obeying I touch its back , and it relapses humbly into silence . Thus we bully each other , with the clock normally leading by a wide margin . ( Once , however , I threw a clock out of the window . and it never bullied anyone again . ) I arise and go into the bathroom . Here I take up a second mechanism and , after inserting a piece of leather between its rollers , move it briskly up and down before proceeding to scrape my face with it . I turn various handles , and a nickel dial studded with small holes showers me with water . Downstairs , if it chances to be either the first or the fifteenth day of the month , I take a can with a very long nose and oil an electric motor which blows petroleum into my furnace , a motor which runs the washing machine , and a motor which operates my refrigeration engine . Meanwhile an electrical range is cooking my breakfast , and on the table slices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buzzing sound in its vitals and then suddenly splits open when the correct shade of brown has been attained . Before I leave the house the whine of the vacuum cleaner is already in my ears . I go to the garage , start explosions in six cylinders of an internal-combustion engine , and proceed to pilot it to the station , passing or halting before three sets of automatic signal lights as I go . At the station I cease operating machinery and resign myself to another man 's operation of an enormous secondary mover , fed by a third rail from a water turbine at Niagara Falls . Arrived at the metropolitan terminal , I buy a package of cigarettes by depositing a coin in a machine which hands me matches and says , " Thank you ; it 's toasted . " I then spend ten minutes walking just three blocks . If I tried to shorten this time appreciably I should most certainly be killed by a machine . Instead , I look down into an enormous pit where the day before yesterday , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brownstone house . Now it is an inferno of swarming men , horses , trucks , pile drivers , rock drills run by pneumatic secondary movers , steam shovels , clacking pumps , and preparations for erecting a gigantic steel derrick . From across the street comes the deafening rat-tat-too of a score of riveters . I enter my office building , and a machine shoots me vertically towards the roof . I step into a large room , stopping for a moment on the threshold to sort out the various machine noises that greet me , that lend a never-ending orchestral accompaniment to all my working days in town . The sputter of typewriters , the thud as the carriage is mapped back , the alternate rings and buzzes of the telephone switchboard , the rhythmic thumps of adding machines , the soft grind of a pencil sharpener , the remorseless clack of the addressograph . To go downtown I use one of the three horizontal levels of transportation which the city affords . As a profound melancholia always accompanies a trip on the lowest , I endeavor to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , particularly since a score of them were killed at Times Square the other day . Killed in the rush hour , like beeves in the Chicago stockyards , except that the packers put no more animals into a pen than can go in . In the evening I reverse the morning process . At home , I may sit for a few moments beneath a machine which gives off ultra-violet rays , or I may dance to strains of a machine which runs a steel needle over a circular , corrugated disc , and for the governor of whose delicate mechanism we are indebted to James Watt . During the days I spend at home , my direct contact with machines is limited to running the motor car , making minor repairs upon it , answering the telephone , and using , hearing , and tinkering with the various household so-called labor savers particularly the plumbing sys-tem . In the summer , by way of contrast , I may spend weeks iu a mountain camp , where the only mechanisms are the motor car , the telephone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , year in year out , I doubt if my direct contact with machines averages much over two hours a day . When I go to town the ratio runs considerably higher ; when I stay at home an hour would certainly cover it ; in the summer an hour would be too much . So far as I am aware , no permanently evil effects befall me by virtue of these two mechanical hours . I suffer from no prolonged monotonies , fatigues , or repressions . The worst moments are dodging street traffic and hearing its roar , riding in the subway , changing tires , and cleaning out the incinerator . All the depressions that I suffer from are certainly compensated for by the helping-hand machinery holds out to me ? a calculator for figuring percentages , an oil heater which requires no stoking , a reading lamp which does not have to be trimmed and filled , an ocean liner in which to go to Europe ( and I go ) , and a car for errands , together with the genuine thrill which often comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a slave , though , of course , I may be one all the same . Clocks and watches are hard masters but so they have always been ? they worried many good men before the days of James Watt . No individual living in a social group is ever free , but I wonder if these two mechanized hours have put more chains on me than were to be found on the Roman citizen two thousand years ago , or an inland Chinaman to-daycultures innocent of engines both . As I look about the United States , the most mechanized nation under the sun , I have reason to believe ? and will shortly adduce the statistical proof ? that the number of those bound intimately to the rhythm of the machine is a small percentage of the total population ; while there are probably more people whose contacts are slenderer than mine , than there are those whose contacts are more pronounced . What with my household engines , my commuting , and my continual sorties along the sidewalks of New York , I am more mechanized than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far less mechanized than a minority thereof . Furthermore , let it be specifically understood that in this article I am analyzing direct contacts with machines ? operating , touching , seeing , hearing , smelling , using them ; rather than the more nebulous , though possibly more important , indirect effects of the power age on the general social structure . James Watt is certainly guilty of doing something to the divorce rate , but just what , nobody clearly knows . For the moment I prefer to cling to more objective phenomena . II While it is impossible to count all the common machines ( there are about seventy common varieties , running into an aggregate of hundreds of millions of units ? all the way from a watch the size of a dime , to a **31;858;TOOLONG turbine ) it is evident that atremendous mass of metal is forever around us ? a wall , which grows higher every day . But that it imprisons us tightly is not even open to question . It certainly does not , and can not , for decades to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be readily jumped over . If my average daily contact with machines is two hours , the average for children and housewives is most certainly less . For farmers , store-keepers , office workers ( except typists and calculating-machine operators ) , professional workers , and the bulk of unskilled construction and transportation workers , it is presumably about the same ; leaving a higher ratio only in the case of factory employees and of certain groups , largely skilled , among the transportation , mine , and construction workers . If I am not undone by contacts with my quota , it stands to reason that most people are not undone . But at this point it is necessary to probe deeper into the meaning of direct contact . I go from Times Square to Yonkers ; in one case in the subway , in the other driving my own car . In both cases I am in direct contact with a machine , employing it over an identical area for transportation purposes . Are the psychological effects the same ? Indeed they arc not . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discomfort , and control by somebody else . My role is entirely passive . In the other case , I dominate my own mechanism , guide it through complicated traffic patterns , speed it up along the fine vistas of Riverside Drive , My role is active and psychologically stimulating . To say , then , that one confronts a machine , is to say something but not very much . The kind of behavior which results from that contact is a far more important consideration and , as an instant 's thought will disclose , all manner of reactions are possible . Despite the diversity , it is possible to reduce these reactions to seven basic classes . 1 . Operating machines with a large measure of individual responsibility in guidance and control . ( Running a mofor car , an airplane , or a locomotive. ) 2 . Operating stationary machines with responsibility only for speed or direction control . ( Running a turret lathe , a vacuum cleaner , the engines of an ocean liner. ) 3 . Tending machines with no responsibility for control . Complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mending yarn on a loom , tightening bolts on an assembly line. ) 4 . Inventing , designing , repairing and inspecting machines . ( The work of the planning and inspecting staffs of any large factory ? say Ford 's ; the day by day work of a good garage man. ) 5 . Playing with machines . ( A child with an electric train ; his father tinkering with a radio ; playing the saxophone , trap shooting. ) 6 . Being carried by a machine with no responsibility for its control . ( Riding in a train , an elevator , a Ferris wheel. ) 7 . Submitting to a machine in someone else 's control ? a variation of 6 . ( Sitting in a dentist 's chair , facing an enemy 's barrage , dodging traffic . ) We touch here the roots of the whole problem of machinery and man . It is obvious that certain machine contacts are as lethal as others are wholesome and invigorating . To control a powerful mechanism such as a locomotive or an automobile is to give the ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even to operate a stationary contrivance like a derrick , a steam shovel , or pneumatic rock drill , is often a stimulating experience . The chief engineer of the Mohawk Trail told me that " every man who comes on the job wants to go on the jack drills . " To make sweeping conclusions about any process so varied is downright nonsense . The Frankenstein chorus does not hesitate to make them , but we can not share their certainties . The most devastating effects are undoubtedly found in category number seven , when men face the mechanisms of modern warfare . In the piping times of peace , however , the category of the most dubious aspect , humanly considered , is certainly number three ? machine tending . In this class falls the regimented factory worker , the robot whose " sinister shadow " has been following us ever since the word was coined by a German dramatist . III Let us concentrate for the moment upon the case of this factory worker , for it is here if anywhere that the gloomy chorus is merited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing relative to the total . population ? What is happening to them physiologically and psychologically ? Is a race of sub-men really being created ? Neither I , nor anyone else , can answer all these questions , because nobody has taken the trouble to collect the basic data ; but I can answer some of them and suggest the available evidence in respect to others . First , as to the number of robots in America . According to the 1920 Census of Occupations , the total persons gainfully employed were 41,615,000 . Of this number , there were 7,972,000 in factories , not including officials . Outside of factories , theoretical robots are to be found in such occupations as running office machines , minding telephone switchboards , cutting coal with machinery , firing locomotives and stationary engines , running elevators , and so forth . The total of men and women in these outside jobs foots up to 827,000 . If we add this figure to the factory workers , we have an aggregate of almost 9 , - 000,000 potential robots ? but we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the opinion of various engineers whom I have consulted , it is probable that less than one-half the factory workers are potential robots , in the sense that they are submitting to the rhythm of machines outside their own control , and hence , by implication , slaves . In other words , more than half of all factory employees are either not operating machines at all ? but rather cleaning , carpentering , painting , handling materials , minding stock ? or they are operating machines under their personal control ? turning the lathe or the grinder on and off , speeding it up and slowing it down BA they shape the wood or metal upon which they are working ? or they are repairing and inspecting machines , which is a skilled and reasonably independent process . If we allow one-half the factory workers as an outside figure for possible robots , and then add the non-factory occupations , we reach a total of a little over 5,000,000-5,338,000 , to be exact . The population of the United States in 1920 was 105,711,000 , and so our possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men , women , and children , and about thirteen per cent of those gainfully employed . Greece in her great days had 5,000,000 freemen standing on the backs of 12,000,000 slaves . I dare you to conclude that a population seventy per cent slave is more wholesome than one possibly five per cent slave to the machine . There are important additional considerations . The United States is more mechanized than Western Civilization generally and , therefore , we should expect to find the proportion of so-called robots at its maximum in this country ( unless possibly in England or Germany ) . Second , factory population ? our biggest item ? has been steadily declining since 1920 . There were 1,250,000 fewer employees in factories in 1928 than there were in 1923 . Third , the whole course of modern technical development is in the direction of more automatic machinery . Mr. Televox now operates power stations with no living man inside of them . The automatic function relentlessly replaces machine tenders and feeders with skilled inspectors , and thus , together with a decline in numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robot class . My guess would be that the ratio to-day is less than four per cent of the total population , and that as the automaticfunction grows , the ratio will steadily decline . The fact that the robot ratio is small , and growing smaller , is not encouraging to the case of the gloomy philosophers , but it does not dispose of the case . Far from it One does not need to be a sentimentalist to recoil from the thought of working in the stokehole of a liner , or of knotting broken threads in a textile mill all day ; and five million human beings in chains remains a ghastly total if it can be established . Can it ? Mr. Ralph Borsodi gives us an excellent illustration of the many robot occupations which still surround us . In one of the great establishments manufacturing automobiles , he tells us , there is a room filled with punching machines . In front of each stands a worker , feeding it pieces of steel by hand . A lever is geared to the mechanism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked to his wrist . As the punch comes down the lever moves back , taking the hand with it . To look down the long room is to see machines , levers , and men in unison ? feed , punch , jerk back ; feed , punch , jerk back . ( Yet these workers were handcuffed partly out of pity for their flesh and blood . Before the articulated levers were installed , they were continually losing their fingers and their hands under the down thrust of the punch . ) It has been estimated that sixty-five per cent of all workers in automobile factories are on the assembly Iine or submitting to mechanical control . The percentage of potential robots is undoubtedly high in this industry ? although a large mill for manufacturing motor-car frames has just been built which is completely automatic , the only labor employed being that of the skilled inspector . But are all machine-tenders thus handcuffed , actually or figuratively ? Here , on the other hand , is a " steel bird . " He is the man who rivets skyscrapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gay . He earns big money , is a mighty spender , and a sporty dresser . He may be killed , but while he lives , he lives ? and swaggers . The power age exalts his personality . Here is a locomotive engineer , indefatigably ministering to a vast black monster . The control of this beast is not always good for his health , but no finer body of men in the sense of character and dependability was ever grown in any culture than locomotive engineers . And here is Charles Lindbergh , minding a machine over three thousand miles of ocean . So closely was he bound to it , that be spoke of himself and it as " we . " In a sense he loved it , and all the world loved him for that affection . I have not heard him called a robot . Nor yet such machine tenders as Chukhnovsky and Commander Byrd . For countless centuries stone was cut with the chisel and the hammer . In 1880 the stone planer was invented , and by 1895 was in wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , but for the men who remained , wages were increased , hours decreased , working conditions greatly improved ? particularly in respect to dust , that greatest of all industrial killers . Because the machines were expensive , better sheds than any hitherto known were erected over them , which they magnanimously shared with the men ? who found themselves working a power-driven planer in light , heat , and comfort instead of driving a chisel in a cold , dreary barn . Or let us take another example . The linotype came in 1887 . By 1903 , 7,500 machines were in use in the United States and Canada , and the industry was completely revolutionized . Hours of labor were cut from ten to eight ; wages were increased some twenty per cent , regularity of employment was greatly increased ? the old " tramp printer " disappeared , shop conditions were improved . The machine brought greater strain , but not of the repetitive variety . " The amount produced on a linotype is directly proportional to the skill of the operator . . . hemust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased the intelligence of printers and so lifted them farther from the robot class . V It is alleged that the modern industrial worker of the class we are considering suffers from injuries to the body and to the mind . The robot , we are told , is the victim of industrial diseases and accidents , and is subject to a growing burden of mental maladjustments resulting in nervous breakdowns , neuroses , and psychoses . He is becoming a sub-man , incapable of taking an intelligent interest in public affairs , and thus a liability upon the community . In respect to his health , the available facts seem to be these . There is little question that the initial stages of the industrial revolution in England and elsewhere were lethal in their effects upon the workers . Robots were made and slain by the thousands . There was relatively far more machine tending , as the automatic process was unheard of , while shop conditions were universally bad . But in about 1850 in England , and with the turn of the century in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of the present-day worker is improving with that of the rest of the population . Take New Haven for instance ? where pretty nearly everybody who does not go to Yale goes to work in the metal shops . In 1880 , the New Haven death rate was 18.2 per thousand ; in 1925 it had fallen to 12.5a decrease of over 30 per cent . During the past half century , says Mr. C. E. A. Winslow , over one-third the total burden of disease and early death has been lifted from human life in the Western nations . We know from other studies that the health of certain industrial groups , particularly those where the factor of dust is high , does not measure up to the community average ; but there is no evidence that industrial workers as a class are going backward in this respect , and a good deal of evidence that they are going forward . Consider the single factor of the great improvement in factory air , light , heat , and sanitation in the past few decades . The healthiest occupations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manure manufacturing ? " an interesting commentary on the widely held theory that bad smells cause bad health . " Electrical workers and machine compositors , he finds , are also very healthy , with death rates less than 50 per cent of average . Then follow clergymen , gardeners , farm laborers , teachers , doctors , and lawyers . Lithography and soap making are very wholesome indoor trades . In respect to industrial accidents , an exhaustive study just published by the American Engineering Council indicates that since 10 ' 20 , while the accident rate per unit of output is declining , total accidents have increased . Production is growing faster than accidents , but more men are being hurt . The Council believes , however , that this is a temporary phenomenon , brought about by the new industrial revolution through which we are now passing ( i.e. mass production ) , and that adjustment will presently be made . Meanwhile it cites many industries and plants in which organized safety work has greatly reduced the number of accidents , and argues for a great increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much because it means less men in the hospital , as because it means more profit to the employer . The Clark Thread Company has a record of ten million man-hours without an accident . If employers generally can get it through their heads that accident prevention pays them in dividends ? and it will not be the fault of the Council if this does not happen ? we may expect a sharp decline in the accident rate in the next decade . In brief , I can see no support for the claim that modern industry is progressively ruining the bodies of its workers . Many are ruined , but as the longer life-span tables show , even more are saved . We turn now to the central charge of the Frankenstein chorus ? the injurious effects of the machine upon the worker 's mind . Here the evidence is scantier and less conclusive . Psychology is still an infant science , and as Professor W. F. Ogburn points out , we know little about what is happening to the central nervous system of the modern machine tender . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crying needs of the times is for more . The amount of sheer undocumented nonsense in this category is colossal . I have read most of it . To begin with , nobody seems to know whether mental diseases are on the increase for the total population , let alone the machine workers as a class . What every medical man is agreed upon is that mental cases now require as many hospital beds as all other cases combined . This looks , and is , serious , but it tells us little about trend . Modern health practice insists more and more upon the segregation of the insane and the mentally defective . In past ages they mumbled in the chimney corner or begged upon the streets . Society now takes care of them ? which speaks well for society , but gives no evidence that there are more to be nursed . Of all men examined for the American army in 1917 , 1.5 per cent were found to be afflicted with mental diseases ? while no less than 1Q per cent were afflicted with bad feet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top . That great numbers of our fellow-citizens are slightly mad is only too painfully apparent ; but how many were in similar sad condition in the Middle Ages , when the only engines were perpetual motion toys that would not work ? When monks and nuns , cut off from the most normal of all human relations , filled their own asylums and overflowed upon the countryside ? When the Roly Office was frightening the world out of its wits ; and saints , devils , witches , magicians were as popular as the movies ? When " all the forms of lunacy thrived , talking poetical moonshine about Doctor Frankenstein , the time has come to throw a bridle around such of these horses as are over-careless where they step . Not around phantom steeds , if you please , but over specific prime movers , and their entourage of tool machines . We ought to know where they are hurting us , how much they are hurting us , and whether or not the hurt is growing . So far as the above analysis has value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nonsense . Talk about machinery enslaving the whole body of the industrial workers is nonsense . Talk about the workers losing their health as a class is unfounded . Talk about the workers losing their minds is very dubious ? the day dreamers have n't any minds to lose , and an increase in mental diseases generally can not be proved . The real dangers , as against the phantom ones , lie in the fact that altogether too many workers are being needlessly hurt in accidents by improperly controlled machines , and that an unknown number , in the absence of fatigue curves or other tests , are doing repetitive work for which they are temperamentally unfitted , and so tearing themselves to pieces . Rather than wail about machinery the enslaver , I suggest the creation of a strong-arm squad to deport any manufacturer who permits machines to mangle his workers , or who puts workers upon them without first testing their ability to stand the rhythm . All machines which by their basic design are over-dangerous either to body or to mind , should forthwith be melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , they are too costly for society to tolerate .
