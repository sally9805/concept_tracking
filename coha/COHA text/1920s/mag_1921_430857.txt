A DEAR , elderly widower had married a fussy , exacting body who demanded many things , completely upsetting his quiet habit of life and stability of income , and terribly agitating his adult children . Now she was insisting upon a small electric runabout just for herself . Sons and daughters uttered vociferous protest : " But , Pad , you ca n't afford it ! " " Mother never had a car of her own ! " " It 's absurd when you just got through building her a new house ! " And as a final unanswerable argument the son blurted out . " Why , Dad , get her that car , and she 'll never be at home ! " And Dad , looking deeper , came back with a sly twinkle in his eye , " Perhaps that 's the best thing about it . " It seems to me that this perfectly exemplifies a larger situation of our times : Men have cried out in alarm , " With all this suffrage , with all this entering of professions . with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women will rush out of the homes ! " And I want to answer , " Perhaps that is the best thing about it " ? only they wo n't cease their clamoring long enough to get it . We know ? we women ? that in all time there have been those in homes who did not belong there : women who would have honored a judge 's bench , thrilled an audience , cleaned up cities and towns and straightened out governments , written books , painted pictures , or modeled in clay , but who never while the sun shone down could make a home . And homes have been hells , and women 's hearts torture chambers , and children 's lives embittered , and needed work in the world left undone , all because of a mistaken idea that all women should be shoved , drummed , crowded , pushed , coerced into homes . Perfectly satisfied with their reading of the law , never getting down to fundamentals , men have considered that the only failure was the failure of the woman to adapt herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every woman knows it and no man ? that many women are gifted for motherhood , for homemaking. for wives in the highest sense , and many have no more gift for this most social and most sacred of all vocations than they have wings to carry them to the moon ! And when you have n't the gift , you ca n't properly mother , any more than you can sing if you have n't a voice . You may learn the technique of motherhood , you may be an expert in baby clothes and fresh air and feeding , but if no fundamental , instinctive mother-gift is there , you can not rise to the full possibilities of the calling . You 've got to be a God-made mother first . And so I say . the best thing about the throwing wide of the doors of the world is the calling of women out of homes , for in the general outpouring those who do n't belong will rush out and find their rightful places , and the home-job will eventually fall to those who should hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these you could n't keep out ? you could n't drive out ! Hold up a baby 's sock , and the mother-hearted woman will turn to it from everything else . Bring a baby into the room , and she will see nothing else , hear nothing else , know nothing else . Her heart , her soul , her whole being is aflame with creation ; her deep secret fires are fires of reproduction ; her life is keyed to this one end , and no counter-attraction can sway her from it . What men do n't know ? and women do ? is that the mother-hearted woman ca n't be steered out of the home . and the nonmother-hearted woman ca n't be steered into it . You may steer her body there , her labors , her daily routine , but you ca n't get her soul , her spirit , there . No house was ever made into a home by a chained personality . by one fighting inwardly to spread her wings and fly to other spaces . " When my youngest child starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll he free ! " And her eyes shone with the hope that was in her . Another woman was discovered weeping as if her heart would break , and on inquiry as to the cause . sobbed out , " I just got to thinking that when baby is six , she will have to start to school and be away from me all day ! " That is just the difference : one finds the child a tiresome tie to distasteful routine , the other finds the child a source of delight , a miracle , a glory-thing , child of her heart , shedding brightness on all her tasks ; no matter how exacting the duties . there is always in the background the consciousness of that wonder-child of hers . Hers ? hers ? she can not quite believe it , the experience is so glory-filled . Have n't you watched these mothers ? You will see them on street cars , in stores , here and there and everywhere . and sometimes with a choking in the throat , for you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never born into life . . . A little child comes near ; instinctively her fingers slip into the rose-petal clasp ; her face lights up with a light that was never on sea or land . A physician told me that the most wearing strain in his life came from dealing with mother-hearted women who for one cause or another were denied children ? how they would come to him , willing to undergo any torment , willing to risk death , only that they might have their own child . It is as a thirst in the desert , as the hunger of the famine-cursed . True mother love is fundamental ; it goes down deep underneath everything else ; it awakens into expression when the babe is conceived . Suddenly this woman loves divinely ; she forgives ; she becomes tender toward all humankind ; she thinks sympathetically of all mothers ; she is all at once akin . linked with the whole human race . As the new little life develops , as it comes more distinctly into her mind as a separate individual , she becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pain is nothing , discomfort is nothing , coming agony is nothing ? the love-light quenches all darkness . And when at last the baby is brought to her , is laid in her arms , she knows that heaven itself has no more to offer her . She draws the soft little form to her , and nestles the tender little head at her breast , and says , " My baby ! " And God is with her , and love makes a halo above her head . Did you ever hear one of these other women talk ? these non-maternal mothers ? A well-to-do , tenderly-cared-for mother of four nice girls told me she had not experienced one solitary feeling of anything but the discomfort of the situation , a sort of repugnance to the whole affair , in bringing her babies into the world . She did n't want them , did n't care about children , did n't see why she should go through all that self-denial , staying in and missing all the good times , just to put children into the world ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lots of women did n't , and why should she ? She could n't wish a more terrible curse on her worst enemy than that she would have a baby ! Wretched , little , puling things ! Fortunately , a mother-hearted relative came to the rescue and mothered the little things . but even so , they are not notably softened into the finer sentiments of life , not especially fond of their mother . Oh , the good fortune of that plastic little being that comes into consciousness on a wave of love that rushes out to meet it ? loved into life , loved into maturity . Can there ever afterward be anything that will compensate for the loss of this experience ? Love has so many languages ; it speaks from eyes ,  | from lips , from songs , from words , from hastening feet . Technique can meet the physical needs , but it can not supply the velvet comfort of a deep maternal love . Children ? little sensitive plates recording everything feel the difference poignantly . A middle-aged woman eminent in world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was the first time any one called her " dear . " She was one of a large , well-do-do family , but she had never been called a pet name , never been kissed save at formal leavetakings. never once been drawn to her mother 's breast in tenderness . Her earliest memory was of being ordered with the other children into the garden to play and told to " keep out of my sight till dinner-time ! " But she had two playmates who had a wonderful mother , a mother who watched over her children , beaming on them like some guardian angel . How she loved that woman who looked at little children with love in her eyes ! Her heart ached with an unconquerable aching . Often , far down in the garden " out of sight , " she would throw herself on the ground and sob herself weak and ill , just from loneliness . And then , one wonderful day when she was playing with the little neighbor girls , something she did ? she always wondered what it was , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her arms ? some little thing caught the love-mother 's attention . Looking up , the child met her eyes bent on her with the same beaming look she bent on her own children , and heard her say , almost under her breath , " You dear ! " The woman told me she ran home charged with joy . She said the words over and over to herself , and when she went to bed that night , she lay wide-eyed , staring up into the dark and recalling the beaming face , the words , " You dear ! " No lover 's words were ever so thrilling ; no after experience was ever so sweet . Just a little , starved child-thing throbbing up to God in the immensity of the night , quivering back to him in joy , because His love had flooded all her being through the lips of a mother-woman . Why , bless your soul , this is what mothers are for , why God made mothers ? to put His love into the little , new life , to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If reproduction had been the sole idea , there would have been better ways ? as fish spawn ? as seeds come in a pod . This individual mother way was not the only way to reproduce , but it was the only way to charge each new , little life with a living love . The Real Mother I used often to watch a certain group of children playing lustily on a green lawn where fireflies winked and blinked their lantern-lights , and a huge old tree was " base . " With the coming of darkness , the children , at last tired out , would run to the wide veranda where mothers sat visiting together . From one of these would come sharply , " Now , Jimmy , do n't you dare lie down there and go to sleep , just for me to undress ! " From the other , tenderly , in a low voice , " Come , Bobby , come to mother ! " And Bobby would run to mother , and settle down beside her on a hassock , and pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspiration from his moist , flushed face , and pat his cheek , and work her fingers through his tousled curls , till by and by he would drop off ; then she would get up to take him in to bed . There would come heated protests : " You are just spoiling that child ! You are making a slave of yourself . I never put a child of that age to bed , and I never will ! " But she would only smile hack , apologetic for her weakness , and go on in and help undress the little boy , bathe his warm body , slip him between fresh sheets , then sit beside  | him and sing softly while his lids grew heavier and heavier . Some way there was always a beautiful look in her face when she came back ? not at all a martyred look ? not nearly so martyred a look as her friend wore . I visited the same group not long ago . The far-away children are grown-ups now , married and doing well , but I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pay " to have children : they forgot you , forgot all you had " sacrificed " for them , were gone , off on their own ends . If she had it to do over again , she would n't have children , she 'd live her own life . I found that she had almost no contact with her son , rarely heard from him in his absences . But the other mother ! Flowers were on her reading table ; it seemed Bobby kept a standing order at a florist 's . He wrote her daily when absent ; he needed her , missed her , wanted her ; and he was just as manly ? did just as fine serN ice overseas ? as the son of the other woman . Expressed love had not made him a " sissy " ; it had only given him an understanding heart and the power to be with his mother through all the days growing for her ever more wintry . She is a contented woman with no complaints as to the ingratitude of children . The avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unless travel over it begins soon and continues steadily , the way closes and it can hardly ever be reopened . The Real Father The difference between men in this thing of instinctive parental love is just as notable as it is between women . I have seen a young father choke up past control when his first baby was brought to him , overcome with the wonder of it all , and I have seen a father turn on his heel in disgust because it was a girl when he expected a boy , or vice versa , with no feeling whatever save of egoistic disappointment . The race in this matter can not be divided into male and female , but in those born to be parents and those not . A distinguished elderly gentleman had just been crowned with the highest honor of his life . All day people surged in , congratulating him . One woman arrived late after the others had gone . He sat there alone , gazing out the window . a look of life-sadness on his worn face . His friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverie . " My dear , " he said , " my secretary was just called to the telephone with the message that his daughter wished to speak to him . Do you see that mountain against the sky ? If it were all mine . and solid gold , I would give every ounce of it to exchange places with him ? to hear from a young girl 's lips , as he just heard , Papa , is that you ? ' " The old poignancy had swept in by way of an ordinary domestic flash to cloud his joy in his greatest earthly hour . The scientists quite a while ago discovered the way of the bees ? how some were marked for parenthood and some for other callings ? but they have seen no better way for the human species than for all to reproduce , then let nature reduce the over-plus of population by way of war and pestilence . Dull , it seems , of the scientists ! And in what cruelties this misunderstanding has resulted ! What tragedies for the woman doomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else God has planted in her for expression is calling with a fury that renders all her days and nights poignant with regret . Panting to . escape ! Praying for release ! Nature pulling at her , tugging at her , demanding her for other fields ! Nature is inexorable : she never ceases her calling . It 's the true call , not of the wild , but of the real ? which is perhaps the same thing , the call of that which God planted there , the thing He needed in his world to make it go ? and now that thing is all unattended to , because of a blind adherence to the idea that all women were meant to be mothers . God knew how his world would have to be run ? like a great orchestra ? and some must finger violins , and some blow on horns , and some beat drums . He organized it  | so and gave to each his part ? and then the poor , stupid , old orchestra lost sight of the Director and went all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever watch one of these non-maternal mothers in her home-nest ? Even when she does her best , lashes herself to her job , how all at sea she is , never knowing the right thing to do , never thinking of the right thing to say , never having on tap suitable advice or direction ? Muddled , puzzled , forever harassed , she stirs with jaded spirit amid chaotic disorder . Maybe she has a gift for housekeeping and runs the house for the sake of itself , never for the sake of human happiness . Maybe she has no gift for housekeeping ; nothing is ever put to rights , meals are never on time or made interesting with happy variations , all is at loose ends without head or heart or administration . Let disaster come , the death of the bread-winner. financial losses , and she deadens herself to her problem with the opiate of books or clubs or what not ? anything to forget ? while her empire sways and swings and totters to ruin . But suddenly release such a woman , lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to freedom , let her do even a little of the thing for which Nature gifted her ? among flowers , or stars , or stones , or sea-shells , or germs ? anything at all that is non-social , that requires no direction of human lives , no home management , no philosophy ? and instantly she becomes organized in all her being . poised , all intelligent response . A new glory and a new youth come to her . Oh , she is never a woman to censure , this misplaced woman ? but to pity . But that other woman , that instinctive mother . Let disaster threaten her brood , and like a tigress she springs to their defense , every faculty awake , every cell and fiber mobilized . every instinct aquiver . She thinks , plans . works , with magic concentration for their protection . for their present happiness and future well-being . Oh , it 's never the situation , it 's the motherheart at the helm that makes the difference . the mother-devotion , the mother-instinct for her own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow Parental Instinct and Genius But ? I can understand some objector in sisting by selective parenthood you would breed all great gifts out of the race ? music . poetry , art , oratory , science , invention . Well , that is where you are wrong , for the most profound parental instinct more often than not accompanies these gifts . Look at Madame Curie. who has given the century its greatest gift ? radium ? and also well-mothered daughters . Look at Schumann-Heink , with her great voice and her great heart and her great family . Many of the finest types of actresses are the most devoted mothers . A poet who would . be named poet-laureate of America ? if we had poets laureate ? is all father-heart , his poem on his four-year-old son being one of the most understanding e pressions of fatherhood in the English Ianguage . An artist whose fame has circled the globe is so intensely father-hearted that he can never go away on the most fascinating of expeditions without taking his six children along with him . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race ? but , oh ; " I would breed love into it ' Breed children who knew from the first opening of their eyes to the last closing that love enveloped all their being . I would breed hardness out of the race , and loneliness , and unwantedness , and repression . and rebellion . I would breed sharp words out of the race , and harsh commands , and slapping , and snatching and jerking . I would breed callousness out of the race , and coldness , and unresponsiveness and indifference . I would breed out of the race the tendency to crime , the cruel  | flowering of thwarted designs in helpless little children . I would divert from motherhood the woman whose soul is bent on polishing mahogany ? I would relieve her of children and send her where she might polish mahogany all her days . I would divert from motherhood that woman so obsessed with a book that her child 's voice , coming up to her out of the wilderness of his young ignorance , is forever an unwelcome interruption . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a world of books . 1 would divert from motherhood that woman so absorbed in flowers that the face of her child appearing before her is only a signal for an order ? another package of seed , a trowel , more fertilizer ; whose eyes are so filled with flowerfaces that they never take in the little human face hungrily asking for love . . . I would free her of child-faces forever and send her to work among flower-faces only . The most unloved ? and later the most unfortunate ? children known to my own childhood were those of a woman to whom all other women went with their plant problems . Consumed with this one mania , she never had time to make her children pretty dresses , to remember their birthdays or note their comings and goings . One became an illegitimate mother ; one married wretchedly and died young ; one went into the army , became a deserter , and paid the penalty . I would divert from motherhood that woman with an antipathy to the intimate ways , who never expresses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles . I would divert these walled-in , self-contained women from motherhood and send them to work in laboratories where matter has no feeling , and feeling is not needed to penetrate the mysteries of matter . Women Who Should Not Be Mothers I would divert all stiff , cold , purely careerminded , purely housekeeping-minded , purely student-minded , purely pleasure-minded , purely go-minded women ? I would divert all women who lack the passion for human set. , ice ? for love implies human service ? I would , in brief , divert every woman in whom the maternal instinct is not the dominating instinct . And I would take chances on any loss to the race by reason of this diversion being more than made up by the coming into existence of a crop of universally loved ? expressively loved -- babies and homes and households . The slow progress of the world is all because there is not enough love in it . and there is not enou h love in it because the real mothers have n't done all the mothering ; and the real mothers have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marriage was the only honorable calling for a woman , and all women rushed into it . But life today offers many honorable callings ? a calling for every gift . Then let me implore you , you women at the turning of the ways , in the interest of unborn humanity , of more love in the world , of peace on earth , unless the maternal instinct dominates you ? unless you crave your own babies , crave a home , feel eager to begin feathering a nest with the softest , gentlest down of pure , high love ? unless all this is paramount with you , stay out of marriage . Turn your steps toward science , to the laboratories , but keep your hands off this sacred human problem ! Perhaps the maternal instinct dominates the majority of women : I do not know ; I am no statistician . But I do know there are enough who do not have it to botch the job , well-nigh to wreck the world . Then leave maternity ? with self-respect and understanding . Leave it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling . But you who have the gift , oh , you most sacredly gifted among women , you first violins in God 's great orchestra ? accept the call of nature , find your mate , and do this greatest of all earthly work . Find in the knowledge that it is God 's greatest work your unbending staff and stay , your reason for being . The child puts you in the race , into the future ; makes you of the long , unending stream . Then go up to God , its hand in yours !  |
