A nanny goat 's baggy profile decorated one newspaper advertisement last week , and a billy goat 's shaggy profile another during the same week . The billy goat invited attention to the versatility of the Seaboard National Bank , whose officers constantly dealt with matters as far away and , as far separated as Oregon and Texas , where goats abound . The nanny goat 's business was more intimate . She " was pertly stating in type that a concern across the continent from the billy 's bank was selling canned goat milk " for babies , delicate children and invalids . . . who can not assimilate cows ' milk . " Her company was Meyenberg Laboratories Inc. , and its home Salinas , Calif . <P> The nanny flicked her beard at a paragraph : " Goat milk is recognized by medical authorities as the ideal food for babies , or adults with weakened digestive powers . The American Medical Journal says ' Goats ' milk is the purest , most healthful and complete human food known . ' Alpure is 100% goats ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains all nutritive elements . " <P> No longer need families tether goats in backyards . No longer need they endure the caprice stench . <P> Yet many a family will retain its comical pet , at once entertainer of children and purveyor to their thirsts . A healthy common nanny can produce 4 Ibs. of milk a day , or about 1,500 Ibs. a year . If she is a well-bred milker the year 's tally may be around 2,200 Ibs . <P> Of course a cow produces far more milk than that . A good one will give bout 25,000 Ibs. a year and feel proud . Yet Segis Pietertje Prospect , property of Carnation Stock Farm at Oconomowoc , Wis. , might well boo at such normalcy . She has filled the pails with 37,381.4 Ibs. of milk in a single year-the world 's record . She is a Holstein . <P> However , let nanny goats feel no humility . They give each year 15 times their weights in milk , whereas cows niggardly produce only six times their weights .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
