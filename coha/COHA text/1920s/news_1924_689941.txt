txt Efforts to get any expression of Southern Railway 's probable dividend action from officers of the company in Washington and New York are fruitless . The Dow-Jones publication Monday should not be interpreted as setting forth the views of Fairfax Harrison , president of the company , and at the office of the Southern it is officially stated that so far as is known , there is absolutely no difference of opinion among the members of the board concerning the dividend policy . So far as can be learned , President Harrison has not expressed or authorized anyone else to express his views on the dividend question . Mr. Harrison 's only expression was at the annual meeting of the company in October last year , when he stated that common stockholders should be entitled to returns on their investment if the company 's earnings continued good , the only question being as to the time of the first payment . Southern 's directors meet in New York March 13 and the Street is full of rumors as to what may be expected at that time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directors remain non-committal.
