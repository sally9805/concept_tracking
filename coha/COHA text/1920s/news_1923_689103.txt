txt Amending an Amendment . To the Editor of The Nett , York Times : In your editorial of Saturday last , entitled " The Volstead Limit : " you at least twice suggested that a law may be passed by the next Congress making it lawful for foreign vessels to transport within the territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes . We . the people , through our duly elected representatives , having written a legislative provision into the Constituticm making such transportation unlawful , can Congress make It lawful ? Are we not In a real dilemma ? The amendment left it to Congress to define intoxicating liquors , but did not leave it to Congress to define " the territory subject to " the jurisdiction of the United States . " It is true that Congress has put the Panama Canal Zone out of this category , so far as transportation is concerned , but that is only another illustratfon of the absurdities born of prohibitory legisle.tion of this character through constitutional amendment . If the Eighteenth Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provision giving Congress power to regulate or prohibit the manufacture , sale or transportation of ittoxicating liquors , we would not now be in this absurd position before the world  --  and ourselves . CLIFTON P. WILLIAMSON . New York . July 2 , 1923.
