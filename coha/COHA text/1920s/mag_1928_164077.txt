Even pinch-dollar voyagers who count the cost of a first class passage must admit that last week the S. S. Majestic gave surplus value for her $265 minimum first class fare . The bonus was in the form of a spry though greying couple who appeared on the passenger list as " Mr. and Mrs , John Robinson . " On the third night out John Robinson mounted the Majesties concert platform and cried genially : " Look here , you people , I am Henry Ford and I will show you how to amuse yourselves in the proper way . What about old-fashioned dances ? " <P> Among those who heard this enticing question was Cinemactor Adolphe Menjou , he of the cynically lifted eyebrow and curling , sophisticated lips . Would exquisite Mr. Menjou respond to you-folksy Mr. Ford ? Fortunately Cinemasophisticate Menjou has such wholesome tastes as a penchant for garlic . Therefore , when Henry and Mrs. Ford led off in a lancers , Mr. Menjou followed , with his fiance , Cinemactress Kathryn Carver , whom he will shortly espouse in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead of Motor Man Ford when he proceeded to waltz , polka , mazurka and Virginia reel . Tales of these dancings and prancings flashed ahead of the Majestic and spiced English comment and curiosity about Celebrity Ford , until his arrival became London 's most toasting-hot teatime news . <P> Debarking at Southampton , Mr. and Mrs. Ford were met by local Mayor Mrs. L. M. Welch who had come to urge that the Motor Man should build a factory on a site which he already owns in Southampton . <P> Gushed Mrs. Welch , " You know , Mrs. Ford , we women must stand together .

Asked whether he would motor through England in a Ford , he replied : " The last time I traveled in this country I went about in a Rolls Royce . What 's more , I took it back to the United States and used it for some years .
