txt Timely Letters to the Editor From Readers of The Times on Topics in the News ARE MEN LOST WITH THE ITALIA AWAITING RESCUE IN THE ARCTIC ? Writer Familiar With Polar Exploration Believes Seven Who Were on Dirigible When It Fell COuld Have Survived To the Editor of The New York Times : The time for the return of day beyond the Polar Circle is approaching . It will not therefore be wasted breath to speak of those seven men , lost with the dirigible Italia , who may stm be alive in a world of blackness and who , knowing well they are not seen , stretch forth their arms toward that world of men to which they long to return ; who , without hope of being heard , cry out their agony to men a feeling , and , withot* hope a returning , live in the illusion of a return . I am firmly convinced that they landed safely and are still alive . My conviction is based partly on my acquaintance with several of them and partly from the testimony of known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expressed that they might have perished in the burning up of the bag , I wrote to THE TIMES that such a statement could not be considered . Today , when the stories of the rescued allow us to visualize the whole of the terrible drama , my belief becomes certainty . Behounek Saw Smoke . As will be remembered , the doubt over the burning of the bag started from the declaration of the only eyewitness , Professor Behounek . He said that , after the fall of the dirigible , he saw rising from the sams spot a faint cloud of smoke . This and the hopeless result of the slight research work possible at the time were enough to lead people to believe that the bag had taken fire and that all the men had perished . While any doubt about Professor Behounek 's declaration must be excluded , as his reputation is sufficient guarantee for the truth of his statement , it is because of this declaration itself that we must exclude the possibility a an explosion of the bag . Professor Behounek said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air only a few seconds . Please follow my reasoning : Shortly before the drop , during one of the periodic inspections , General Nobile had ascertained that there still remained . more than a ton of benzine in the fuel tanks . When any substance of high inflammability explodes it forms a thick black cloud of characteristic shape which stays in the air for a long time and is visible at a great distance . In addition to that ton of benzine there were also in the bag not less than 20,000 cubic meters of hydrogen gas , which at the first spark would have exploded with a roar , comparable only to that of a hundred large , runs But not one of the six survivors of the red tent heard any explosion and no one saw a column of smoke rising . Was Smoke a Signal ? Nobile and his companions give thirty miles as their approximate distance frOm the bag at the time it fell . He who has done any hunting in polar regions knows how keenly the report of a gun penetrates those icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard . It must then necessarily be deduced that the smoke seen by Professor Behounek was not due to the bursting into flame of the bag but that it was a signal from the survivors in the hope of pointing out to the cabin group the exact spot of their descent . There are other things to be taken under consideration . Among the seven left in the bag was Arduino , whose rare ability as an aerial navigator I was able to appreciate on the flight of the Norge . Arduino , a cold , self-possessed individual , would not fail even at such a tragic moment . Nobile , Mariano and others assert that Arduino , looking out from the gash in the side of the bag , cast upon them a glance of despair , but this only for an instant . Then they saw him bend over the supply bundles and hurl them down upon the ice . The man proved himself there . At the height of the tragedy , when every human faculty seem turned to stone , he was able to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to provide them with what they needed as the bag dashed away . Supplies Were Found . The precious bags of supplies were discovered by Malmgren the day after the fall along the path taken by the bag . A man able to do this at such a time must have thought also of those with him , as he alone could save them . To Arduino it could not have been a difficult task to arrest the bag 's flight and control its descent . He was a master in the management of the valves . The fact that Nobile and his companions saw the dirigible come down slowly about thirty miles away proves that the bag was under control . The fire therefore did not occur before the descent . If it had taken place at the moment of landing on the ice , those who were following the fate of the bag with eyes of despair could not have missed either smoke or flame or sound of explosion . But the smoke was seen later , which fact confirms the deductions that it came from a signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be said , six months have passed since the tragedy . For six months the lost men have been wrapped up in the darkness of the polar night and subjected to the rigors of the Arctic Winter . Still , it would have been possible for them to survive. - Former polar expeditions have demonstrated the easy adaptability of man in the Arctic Circle . He has lived in ice huts and fed himself by hunting and fishing . Add to this that if we admit the safe descent of the bag , it represents for lost men something better and safer than an ice hut in which to sheiter themselves from the rigors of Winter . Add also that they were amply provided with fuel for keeping themselves warm and for cooking ; that they had a quantity ' of food and much clothing , fur bags , medicines , and arms and ammunition . But , above all , they were provided , as men who had voluntarily lent themselves to a. polar enterprise of the most dangerous kind , with a will to live , with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold death back and to await patiently the hour of rescue .

URGES PATERNALISM FOR ALL Crossroads Philosopher , Irked by Shipping Loan , Clamors for His Own Share To the Editor of The New York Times : I seen a piece in your paper recently what got my goat . This here piece told all about how the Shipping Board intended loaning government funds , at a low rate of interest , to a certain steamship corporation to finance operations . In other words , an appointive government board intends to hand over to few . favorites to play with funds partly wrung in taxes from us farmers who had to earn said taxes through most awful drudgery and misery . However , let 's get down to cases on this here proposition . For years I 've been hollering my head off almost against any form of farm relief legislation . I 've said we farmers did n't need it , did n't deserve it , did n't desire it , and should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embark in no paternalistic ventures . Besides , I contended , all such special legislation only meant government executives who would require countless subordinates , all to be retired , eventually , on a pension . Logic Thrown to the Winds . I contended it was n't the province of the government to loan no money to anybody . No siree , said I. No helping folks . Every washboiler on its own bottom , I yelled . Less government in business and more practical work at Washington . And was n't I logical , Mr. Editor ? But now I 'm through hollering , as I am out for any old kind of farm relief . Of course , I well know that any such legislation , like that proposed last Winter at Washington , will necessarily enhance the price of eats to your city slickers , but what do I care ? Ai n't self preservation a fundamental law ? If it 's right for one set of men to hog it , why should n't I try a whack at the game ? Ai n't I just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gent hen good for the lady variety ? Paternalism for All . If it 's right for one coterie of men to have the government give them every other section of the land , besides cash , to build railroads across the plains to the Pacific Coast ; if it 's right for the strong arm of Uncle Sam to entwine itself around them infant industries so them birds will be protected against pauper labor elsewhere ; if it 's right for our legislators to build government irrigating ditches ( extravagant and seldom self sustaining ) so one section may prosper and if it 's right and proper that our representatives shall spend our hard earned taxes in other paternalistic ways , its perfectly feasible , logical and fair that us farmers , the producing class , shall have government aid . ' Cause ai n't we now raising eats for all you non-producers at a loss ? I 'll say we are right now . Naturally , you may casually remark if we do n't like our present avocation we can pull up stakes and run down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other less arduous and highly paid occupation . But that 's all tommyrot , as we are tied . We have all our money spread out here in houses , machinery and land . And if we did desire to sell , who would buy ? Why , none but some city halfwit with spare cash now purchases farm property . The Handicapped Native Born . It is unnecessary for me tonight to rave any more over this matter . But before I quit I just want to tell you a few things . With nearly 300 acres of wonderfully productive land here I am now going behind financially . So is every other native-born farmer hereabouts , who has to hire labor . No one but a foreigner , with a husky wife and a slew of kids what can and will help him with the drudgery. subsisting without any of the luxuries of life , can make a living off mother earth around these parts . Of course , you could recount how you know a feller in the backwoods somewhere what cleared $500 off strawberries last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 300 times that acreage I should net $150,000 . But there ai n't nothing to all that baloney . And you know it as well as I do . However , you city folks may continue your indifference to the crying needs of agriculture . You may overlook and fail to grasp the deplorable situation we farmers are now in . You may condone the actions of this here Shipping Board and you may laff at these here hollers of mine . But such complacency is making a lot of good men everlastingly peevish and willing to take a chance with that there Soviet form of government . And when I say all this I ai n't kidding as usual , either . by . heck . HOMER M. GREEN . Middletown , N. Y. , Feb. 26 , 1929 . SLAVERY IN ABYSSINIA To the Editor of The New York Times : The inference which the uninformed might draw regarding conditions in Abyssinia from THE Tams article , " Finds Open Slave Trade , " would be most unfair to that remarkable nation . For centuries Abyssinia has ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is one of fae oldest Christian nations on earth , having adopted the Coptic form of faith about 300 A. D. This it still maintains . That the priests use unwarranted efforts attempting to control the political situation in Abyssinia is a complaint which might be made of other nations . Conditions surrounding slavery in Abyssinia are difficult for the American mind to comprehend . The greatest outcry against the abolition of slavery would probably come from the slaves themselves . Their condition compares favorably with those in other areas in Africa now dominated by European nations . It is well known , however , that his Majesty Tafari Makonnen Is making Intelligent and able efforts to solve the slave problem so that it will be eliminated eventually with a minimum of hardship to all concerned . It would seem proper to quote from a communication from his Majesty to the League of Nations in which he said : " The people of Abyssinia are anxIOUS to do right , and we have every intention of guiding them along the path of improvement and progress ; but throughout their history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to possess themselves of Abyssinian territory and to destroy their independence . With God 's help , and thanks to the courage of our soldiers , we have always , come what might , stood proud and free upon our native mountains . " It is well known that the attitude of his Majesty to viriting Americans is most cordial and that he desires the existing friendship between the United States and Abyssinia to be always maintained .

DEFINING DIPLOMACY To the Editor of The New York Times : There appeared a witty definition of what a diplomat is by Will Rogers in THE TIMES recently which recalled one or two witticisms by Henry Labouchere , the late editor of London Truth , bearing on the . same subject , which I heard him mutter some 35 years ago in the House of Commons . Diplomacy , in his opinion , consisted In " spending one 's life to explain to others that which you do not understand yourself .

COORDINATED EFFORT NEEDED IN A PATRIOTIC ENTERPRISE Development of Original Washington Estate at Wakefield Calls for Cooperation by Federal and Private Interests To the Editor of The New York Times : The recent purchase of a large portion of the original Washington estate at Wakefield , Va. , by Mr. Rockefeller and his offer of it to the Wakefield National Memorial Association on condition that $115,000 be raised before Jan. 7 , 1930 , has attracted public attention to this historic place . May I offer a few remarks to throw light upon the situation ? Last year , when in the employ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for developing the Wakefield property and thus to become acquainted with the place and its history . ? The site of the house in which George Washington was born is on a beautiful promontory overlooking the junction of Pope 's Creek and . the Potomac River . It comprises about forty acres and belongs to the government . The custody a this reservation is vested in the engineer office of the War Department . Adjoining this government property is another promontory , formerly a part of the Washington estate , on which the Wakefield National Memorial Association owns nearly seventy acres . The Washington family burial plot and the supposed site of the family 's first American homestead , near Bridge 's Creek , are about a mile distant . At present the burial plot is in a sadly neglected state . It is this latter tract , I understand , that Mr. Rockefeller 's offer would add to the Wakefield Association 's holdings . The whole area , including the government reservation , which contains the focus of interest , ought to be developed as a single unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born was burned in 1780 . The Wakefield Association has retained Edward W. Donn Jr. , an architect who is an authority ? on early American architecture , to draw plans for a manor house true to the period to replace the one that burned . The association will provide funds for building it , but the land where it should be put is government property . At present there exists some difference of opinion as to where it is best to place the restored manor house . All traces of the ruins have long since disappeared . George Washington Parke Custis , son of George Washington 's stepdaughter , identified the approximate location of the bedroom in which George Washington was born and in 1913 a stone marker was placed . on this spot . In 1895 this marker was replaced by a tall granite obelisk . At the time this monument was erected some traces of the house foundations were found . Recently the association , under permit from the War Department , employed an engineer to explore the site . He excavated trenches around the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every trace he found of the foundations and all relics he came upon there . Then he backfilled his trenches . Authentic Data Lacking . These investigations were not extensive or systematic enough to expose the full extent , dimensions or complete outline of the foundations . Hence , the exact size and shape of the house is not shown by this evidence . No authentic plans or pictures of the house are known to exist . So any reproduction of the manor house can only be an approximate restoration . Only an inventory Indicating the number of its rooms and their furniture is extant to serve as a suggestive guide to the restorers . Yet it is proposed by some persons to build the new house on the old foundations and to call it a replica of the house in which George Washington was born . It ie felt by other persons that to do this would be an unfortunate perversion of patriotic interest and zeal . Moreover , it would conceal from view all that really is authentic  --  namely , the ruins of the foundations . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uncover the ruins completely , to be an object of veneration by pil- grims . It is their desire further that the manor house shall be reproduced close by . It would then be a visual setting in which one 's imagination could conjure back the home life of the boy Washington . ? It would serve also as a repository for WashingtonJana . A more extended account of Wakefield and the proposed ' plans for its development , together with I photographs , was publiahed by the I writer in the January issue of Current History . It is to be hoped that these incomr patible but equally patriotic ? interests may be reconciled in time to make possible the development of a national shrine at Wakefield before the bicentennial in 1932 . The recent appeal of Mrs. Harry Lee Rust Sr. president of the Wakefield National Memorial Association , for funds to meet Mr. Rockefeller 's offer and to develop the property deserves the heartiest support of every patriot and admirer of George Washington . E. EUGEDTE BARKtR . Bronxville , N. Y. , Feb. 27 , 1929 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New York Times : At a time when the government is spending millions of dollars annually for prohibition enforcement , the question suggests itself why it is , that the Harrison anti-drug law has produced such excellent results without the employment of the degrading methods to which the government has been driven by the Vo/stead law ? Disregarding entirely the well-established fact that a law the people do not want can never be properly enforced and considering only the material side , recently elicited statements should be of Interest and some value . The head of one of the largest manufacturing and wholesale drug houses in the Middle West states that the sale of morphine has declined more than 95 per cent since 1913 , owing to the efficient nonhabit-forming drugs which have taken its place . He also stated , incidentally , that these substitute drugs , together with the sale a paregoric and many so-called " tonics " of high alcoholic content , had served to draw the users from morphine . A leading druggist says that drug stores now carry only very small quantities of morphine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two a month . A well-known physician stated that morphine is no longer prescribed ; that it is administered by the physician in person and is now used almost exclusively in surgical cases . Physicians are agreed thatsubsti-. tutes for opium , &c.,; are most valuable in that they are not habit-forming , and addicts can be taken off the more violent drugs with substitutes and much more easily cured . From the foregoing it appears that the grand mistake was made in taking away from the people all alcoholic drink in a moment and giving no substitute therefor . The strictest prohibitionist does not question his doctor 's right to administer opiates in such quantities and at such times as he sees fit , but he insists that the same doctor shall prescribe a limited amount of whisky only , and . at specified intervals . If substitutes and . an ? intelligent ministration of the laws have done so much in the case of " dope , " why not with " booze " ?

Spratt of the State Tax Department takes exception to my criticism of the department in allowing the assessors in the rural sections to place an excessively high valuation on farm properties , thereby leaving them suitject to an excessively high bonded indebtedness . Mr. Spratt writes : " The State Tax Commission has only advisory and supervisory power over the local assessors , and of itself Is absolutely without power or authority to either lower or raise any valuations made by local assessors . " I do not possess the power or the authority to either lower or raise the amount of milk from my dairy . That is carried on by the chemical action and the internal machinery of each cow ' in the dairy . But it is plainly within my power so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk . The supervision of the assessors by the Tax Commission has been in vogue at least since 1880 . At that time my father was supervised as an assessor , and I know of no time since then when the State Tax Commission has not met with the assessors at the various county seats for the ? purpose of instructing them in their duties . These assessors are plain average citizens , not claiming scientific knowledge of the business , who come at the call of the Tax Commission at an expense to the county of about $9 per day per man . They are , as they see it , being instructed by men who are experts in the work , who receive their tax rolls and return them for correction if found incorrect . Therefore I hold that when farm properties are assessed for sums so large that the tax can not be met by their gross incomes and that farms are being given away to avoid the burden of taxes and others are taxed so high that no one will accept them as gifts , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.

MAN AND THE UNIVERSE Exception Is Taken to Mr. Garbedian 's Philosophy and Dr. Banner 's Theories To the Editor of Thc New Thee Times : " Our Universe Bares Its Heart " is the type of the articles that delight readers of THE Tans . To one , at least , there is a fly in the ointment that Mr. Garbedian might easily have kept out with a corresponding improvement . That is his fifth paragraph , in which he quotes a truthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect by his own comment which precedes it . He says , " Dr. Shapley 's work has reduced man to such utter insignificance in the cosmos that he is now less than a pebble on the celestial beach . " He is naave enough to take the force out of his own statement by adding Shapley 's answer to Harry E. Barnes 's recent ebullition , namely , " The effect of his own work should be to ' lend a greater dignity to roan 's existence and cosmic performance . ' Questioning Statements . How can both statements be true ? Man can not be reduced and magnified at the same time . Barnes 's logic is about as compelling as Mr. Garbedian 's . " A new concept of God " because the dimensions of the universe have been lengthened ! How can one extend this concept : God is a spirit , infinite , eternal and unchangeable in His being ? With all our increased knowledge of the starry world , in what respects has David 's religion been changed where he says " The heavens declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with all the extension of knowledge God 's glory and our worship of Him to truly devout and noble minds has been only intensified . " The undevout astronomer is mad ! " The man who looks and learns and reads may fill himself with figures of expansion and be what Carlyle well proclaimed him to be , " A pair of spectacles behind which there is no eye . " The ancient psalmist has exactly the same reaction to the greatness of the universe that we have today . He asks , as he considers the heavens , the work of God 's hands , the moon and the stars , " What is man ? " Neither is he swallowed up by his own conceits but gives the eternal answer that ? will keep the psalms alive when Barnes Slid all his tribe of materialistic thinkers have been buried never to be resurrected .

That 's the reaction of the religious mind to all glorified conceptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He compares this insignificant bit of material substance in. which man dwells for a while with the great material mass . The comparison is absolutely unscientific and unphilosophic . How can mind be compared to matter ? They exist in two different categories . Who has made possible the wonderful knowledge contained in Mr .. Garbedian 's article ? Man . Man is not small . He has an eye which no optician or oculist ever beheld ; It is as far-seeing as the longest telescope . Professor Shapley is a man . Others like him have weighed the stars , stolen their secrets from the far-distant suns , gathered the unseen thoughts of the eternal Creator . and God of all of us up into a plot , and demonstrateu absolutely that man is God in a small way and truly His son . Christ never saw a telescope and did not need to see one . He had the dignity of heaven on His brow , and proclaimed to the world he would save from materialism and utilitarianism that a man is measured by his soul . New Concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul to be dismayed and run to a corner because a few more suns are added to the material world . One man is bigger than Betelgeuse when that man has Shapley 's or Osborne 's or Einstein 's mind in his little bit of human flesh and bone . What is Betelgeuse ? Nothing but a material combination pulled apart and whirled around by cosmic forces . What is man ? A mind handling cosmic forces ; ? molding and building and bossing and learning and worship- ing . Give us all the facts you can , Mr. Garbedian , but keep your philosophy back . Your facts stimulate , but your comments just aggravate . We are not " pebbles on any celestial beach . " We are workers together with God and workers unafraid . What we need is not it new concept of God , as Mr. Barnes so weakly concludes , but a little more real fiber in our souls .

This would increase . the sale of writing paper and incidentally of waste baskets made of paper pulp . Another good way in which the public could use more writing paper is in notifying the various city departments of needed improvements that might not otherwise come under their notice or be taken care of with sufficient promptness . I have often done this and the matter has always been taken care of promptly , such as dangerous openings along sidewalks , unwarranted obstructions on the sidewalks , dangerous holes in pavements , removing unsanitary and fire-hazard refuse , putting refuse boxes on the slot machines in the subway , &c.; Several tons of paper could be used in this way each year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Feb. 26 , 1929 .

May I call attention to the fact that the word " ferronniere " is the French for the band which the lady wears around her hair ? This seems to have given the picture its title . I quote from Le Petit Larousse Illustre : " ferronniere . . . chaine ceignant le front et retenue en son milieu par un joyau ( comme dans le portrait de la Belle Ferronniere , par Leonard de Vinci ) , " which may be translated : " Coronet ( or headdress ) chain binding the forehead and held in place by a jewel ( as in the portrait of la Belle Ferronniere by Leonardo da Vinci ) .

FREE TRADE WOULD OBVIATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regarded as Call of Special Privilege and Therefore Out of Order To the Editor of The New York Time 8 : In reference to the expected special session of Congress to be called for the purpose of affording some measure of farm relief , it should be understood by the American people that the demand for this is no more in order than is any other measure of ' special privilege . It will be found that this demand is universally based upon protective tariff and upon the assumption that the government , having already favored Eastern man- ufacturers with this tariff . Ehould now favor Western farmers with similar class legislation . It may be true , and there is ample evidence to sustain this contention , that the farmers were grossly discriminated against in the regulation of the price of farm products during the war , but this does not justify any special privilege at the present time . The farming industry is like any other . In every one . of the agricultural States there are master farmers who within a comparatively few years have attained to affluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , it will have to be conceded that these master farmers are exceptional and have succeeded in spite of adverse conditions which have caused the existing depression in agriculture . Natural Law Operates . The natural law of supply and demand should operate properly to regulate the farming industry as every other industry . If a farmer finds agriculture unprofitable it is his privilege to go into something else . In this connection it is interesting to recall the experience of the farmers of Denmark during the ' 80s . The influx of low-cost American grain caused the farmers of most of the European nations to demand and to receive relief in the shape of protective tariffs . But the farmers of Denmark were more progressive . They did not ask for protection , but instead made use of the low-cost cereals from America and gave up the raising of wheat and corn , turning instead to the raising of cattle , swine and poultry and the establishment of extensive dairy production . The one factor which , more than anything else , interferes with the prosperity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land has been " kited " so many times that it is now inflated to many times what it should be and he has to make a profit based upon this inflated land value .

In those days wheat sold for $1 a bushel , and today the price is little above that figure , notwithstanding the fact that labor-saving machinery has enormously reduced the cost of wheat raising . This great advantage of labor-saving machinery , including transportation facilities , should naturally have greatly reduced the selling price of wheat . But this advantage has , instead , been transmuted into inflated land values . As a result of the inflated price of farming lands the would-be farmer today is compelled to pay a tribute to land speculation that involves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation ago was secured for only a fraction of that amount , and as a result of this he finds it necessary to borrow a large portion of the necessary price .

This in itself is in the nature of an enormous tax that has to be paid before other taxes are paid . Our Canadian cousins have adopted the wiser plan of eliminating all taxes upon farm buildings , machinery , stock and improvements , collecting the revenue instead from the proper source , land values .
