If your little boy calls your neighbor a naughty name , you can spank the urchin , wash out his mouth with soap and water and not let him ride his bicycle for a week . That usually pacifies the neighbor . But if you run a newspaper and some cub reporter decorates a story with opprobrious epithets , either invented by himself or repeated after a third person , you are , if the epithets get published , responsible for their accuracy to the person described by them . If the injured one sues you , it will do you no good to discharge the cub reporter . You have a libel suit on your hands . You have to prove that he is , as the case may be , " an itchy old toad , " " a tool of profiteers , " " a damaged-goods chap . " Following is a glossary , compiled last week by Editor and Publisher , of words and phrases each one of which has figured in a libel action won by the plaintiff : <P> Anarchist ; bankrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; crooked ; damaged-goods chap ; destitute ; extreme poverty . <P> Felon ; fraud ; frozen snake ; gambler ; henchman of a notorious character ; humbug ; hypocrite ; impending insanity ; impostor . <P> Infernal villain ; insane ; insolvent ; insulting to ladies ; ironical praise ( such as to call an attorney " an honest lawyer " when the opposite is implied ) ; itchy old toad ; liar ; mere man of straw ; obituary of a living person . <P> Packing a jury ; pseudo scientist ; rascal ; rogue ; scoundrel ; slacker ; suicide fiend ; syphilis ; thief ; tool of profiteers ; unfit to be trusted with money ; and villain .
