To New Orleans last week went the delegates of U. S. trade unionism to attend the 48th annual convention of the American Federation of Labor . Justly they felt important , for they represented more than 3,000,000 of the citizenry . The convention opened with overtones of optimism . Labor had heard about President-Elect Hoover 's scheme to prevent unemployment , as outlined by Maine 's Brewster at the New Orleans conference of Governors ( see p. 13 ) . Of this scheme William Green , President of the A. F. of L. , had said : " It is the first definite movement to systematize wages &; employment . . . the first important announcement on wages made for a decade . " <P> President Green was also jubilant at the progress made with labor 's policy of the five-day , 40-hour week . Said he : " A total of 165,029 members of organized labor have won this new advance . " <P> Secretary of Labor James John Davis reminisced of iron-puddling , mule driving . The color of his speech was roseate : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead as a dodo . . . . Prosperity is not the product of the classes ; it is the product of the masses . . . labor-saving machines are rapidly becoming leisure-producing machines . " <P> Resolutions , many in number , varied in purport , were sent to committees , including : <P> Several proposals to extend the immigration quota to the entire Western hemisphere , especially Canada , Mexico , the Philippines . <P> A proposal to exclude Filipinos altogether . <P> A proposal to eliminate private profit in the production of munitions &; warships . <P> But by far the most striking gesture of labor was made outside the A. F. of L. convention . Also in New Orleans met delegates of newly-formed Labor Association , the American Wage-Earners protective conference representing 17 international unions with 250,000 members . The venerable bugaboo of tariff was their concern . They contended that present tariff rates were flooding the country with imported merchandise , that thousands of U. S. laborers were therefore out of work . This claim naturally hinged on statistics . There was a fat volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . Figures showing the increase of imported wares between 1920 and 1927 were copious and astonishing . Glass products had mounted from $14,000,000 to $30,000,000 ; clay products from $15,000,000 to $23,000,000 ; boots and shoes from $700,000 to $5,000,000 . Photo-Engravers , Tobaccomen , Hatters , Metal workers . Bookbinders , Lithographers and many others studied similarly distressing data . Finally they issued a manifesto of principles and purposes . Among them : Labor demands representation on the Tariff Commission . The Commission should consist of experienced industrialists . Duties should be levied according to U. S. rather than foreign values . Immediate tariff revision is necessary . The President-Elect shall be requested to convene a special session of Congress for this purpose .
