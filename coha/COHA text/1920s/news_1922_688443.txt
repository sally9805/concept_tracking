It is a pleasure to respond to so reasonable a request , and the fact that most of the factors entering into the index point to improving conditions , makes the tusk doubly agreeable .

In this index the average of prices in 1913 is taken as 100 for the base upon which the computations are made : Between May , 1920 , and April , 1922 , is a difference of 118 points in all commodities . But those wild fluctuation : of the deflation period are now over and the course of prices since April continues to show stability .
