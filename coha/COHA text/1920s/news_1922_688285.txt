txt The pressing need of investigation and constructive suggestion in the matter of the Cook county jail offers an issue for candidates in the approaching county election which we believe is not being fully realized . The subject is brought forward again through an address by Amos W. Butler , an Indiana authority on penology , before the City club . Our present county jail is a long standing disigrace to Chicago and the county . As lung ago as 1510 it was publicly condemned by the international prison congress . It has been inadequate for twenty years , according to Mr. Butler . Proposals for improvement or ' replacement with a modern structure have been made repeatedly , but never in such form as to bring constructive action . It is high time that were changed .

It is necessary to.have t jail near the criminal " courts to house prisoners awaiting trial . The old jail , if uncrowded , could ? . ) e used for that . It could be so used if unother jall were constructed On cheaper ground , on the mtskirts of the city , to house offenders serving Mt their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should lave a definite program for this important improvetient to which incoming county officers would be leflnitely committed .
