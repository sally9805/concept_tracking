" T HE American people does not think . " Very well , no mass of 120,000,000 people ever has thought ; it takes but the most rudimentary knowledge of crowd-psychology , unanimism , etc. , to know that thought does not occur in such aggx-egates . Why expect our nation to surpass , ) all so easily and so undesigningly ; ) the records of the past and " great nations of antiquity " ? " The American peopledoes not remember . " Another age-old quality or defect of the populace , the traditional populace . Americans under thirty do not remember prewar Europe , for the natural reason that they mostly never saw it ; and in consequence they can not be expected to become especially enraged over particular imbecilities that have developed in Europe since 1914 or 1918 . Elder American tourists have not all of them been in Europe before ; and we are , let us suppose , the most patient and nebulous race of beings that have ever moved on this planet . The majority of tourists appear to believe that European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their historic perspective does not reach back to , let us say , the causes of Wilson 's first election . We are , as a nation , educated to look not to the past but the future ; as the simple-minded freshman is told to look up  --  while you slip a , bit of ice down the front of his collar . The post-war annual exodus to Europe is divisible roughly into three or four parts : ( 1 ) The studious , I mean the young , actively acquisitive explorers ; ( 2 ) the cultural , I mean the patient old ladies who have been saving up for some time ; ( 3 ) the drunks ( a post-war phenomenon  --  this in any such quantity as to demand special treatment ) , and ( 4 ) the shoppers . I suppose these are all particularly patient classes . The old ladies have learned patience ; the young are still accustomed to being interfered with by college deans and other such formenifera ; the drunks are so relieved by the prevalence of certain facilities that they are ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiots , and besides they usually have attendants to take trouble for them . ( So also have the envoys of the Standard Oil and other legendary monsters with whom the bureaucracy distinctly does not monkey . ) While Europe still " groaned under tyranny " I wandered about the face of this continent , I went on foot into its by-ways for sixteen years with no " papers , " that is to say with no brass checks , no government 's petty officials ' , permission , nothing in fact , but for one year ( 1911 , I think it was ) an unstamped membership card to the Touring Club de France , and a tin button of that fraternity which helped me to get into a small inn at Chalus when covered with twenty miles of mud . ? This comfortable period is " over " ; not- permanently , if I can help it , but at any rate suspended ; and this suspension has continued for six or eight years too long . To trace the remote causes of any ill odor is a thankless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , sources of civic pride as the late Bryan , the late Wilson , and the unfortunately still extant personnel of the United States Department of State . It- is ; alas , almost wholly forgotten that Bryan gave Wilson to America ; and that Wilson subsequently introduced into international affairs an academic mind ; a mind used not to dealing with adults , but to administering petty formalities to an adolescent scholastic body . And whatever ultimately be said by Mr. Wilson 's apologists , and whatever final praise be given to his aims and aspirations , there remains at least one private-conviction that during his rule the civic organization of America - suffered very great damage ; that the individual welfare of the citizen went by the board ; that the powers of all classes of officials were extended beyond the limits of decency , and beyond limits- compatible with the permanent safety of the commonwealth . Yes , these are very large words . Let ' em stand . What , gentle reader , are bureaucrats ? Hired janitors who think they own the whole building . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently produced several students of bureaucracy , severa/ authors who have studied the fonctionnaire as one studies other poisonous insects , and even tried to explain and account for his actions ; his inhibitions . The result is not encouraging . One can sympathize with a tyrant , led- on by some megalomania. or some dream of ultimate benefit to the race or some decoration of his own personal glory ; - one can sympathize with the crook who does it for excitement , or the poor devil who steals to feed himself or his family ; but for the rond-de-cuir who sits in an office devising , in perfect safety , some inane means of annoying others , one can have no tolerance . Mr. Wilson might have made a fairly successful Emperor of Byzantium ; in the year 853 few of his habits would have greatly annoyed the populace of that city . But a President who exceeds his functions naturally encourages the small fry to follow suit . There had been , before Wilson 's election , very few Democrats ; the supply for normal appointees was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter . The war produced , if not a new ruling class , at least a- new zealous bossiness . I had my first meeting with the new civic order during the armistice . I was living in London . I was told that-I --  " could not go toFrance unless I had business . " I naturally had business . I received a lot of other improbable information from the under-sub-vice-assistant . My wife could not - possibly accompany me unless she were ill. -I naturally produced doctors ' certificates . I could not-move about in France ; I must go to one place and stay there. - At this - point I was rescued by an elderly intelligent official from - another department who took two hours off and swore to several contradictory statements in a manner showing great familiarity with the mind-ersatz of-officialdom . I went to France . When I got to Toulouse I found , as I had suspected , that the **26;27;TOOLONG information was false . The young chap at the mairie told me I could do as I liked , and that I was free to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border an officer on horseback rode up behind me - and asked where was I going . I said " Mt . Segur . " He said " All right , go there . I am looking for French deserters . " This was , you perceive , before the so-called Peace of Versailles , and before all Europe had gone crazy over formalities . I had no trouble till I got back to Paris and entered the American consulate . There the vice-assistantsecond-sub categorically forbade me to return to my home in London . I said : " I live there , " and suggested that he ask the assistant-first-vice or some one higher up concerning the regulations . He disappeared behind a partition , and returned with a request that I " get a letter " from my employer , evidently knowing no strata of life save one where everyone has an employer . It was next suggested that I find some sort of " reference " - for myself . Every American I had- known in Paris before the war had left . I knew no one save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought vaguely that he might have other things to do  --  at that particular time  --  than look after passports . However , I stepped into a taxi and drove round to the embassy . The embassy dealt with the consulate , and I proceeded about my lawful occasions . That was 1919 , and Europe was , confessedly , in a mess , and errors might be exceptions . But what in heaven 's name has that temporary confusion to do with 1924 , 1925 , 1926 , 1927 ? What has it to do with the unending boredom of waiting an hour , a half-hour , - three hours , in countless bureaus , for countless useless visas , identities , - folderols ? England is not richer than we are ; England is not less exposed to the immigration of undesirable units . The British passport costs seven shillings , sixpence ( less than two dollars ) ; - it is good for seven years . Visas to other countries have either been mutually abolished or their cost reduced to a trifle . - - The American official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American indi- . vidual . And what is more , we have one of the clumsiest systems of communication between individuals , and unorganized groups of individuals , that exists in any allegedly representative government . Apart from our tendency to put up with anything , and our instilled duty to be humorous instead of taking action , the normal American has no idea whatsoever as to how he should or can deal with any executive infamy . That , I take it , is part of the price we pay for having our national capital tucked away in a corner . The English who do- most things badly are at least able to get at- their rulers. - Someone takes little Whiff or old Jiblet out on a golf-links and wrings his figurative neck ; someone knows so-and-so and the matter gets a few moments ' attention. - . Anything causing inconvenience to ten or - twenty thousand literate people can - be got on the- floor of the House of Commons in , I should say , forty-eight hours . In - the United States this could only happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Our ideal public servant was given a one-column-wide , four-inch newspaper boost some months ago : " Aged 70 and a bachelor , has not taken a vacation for 20 years , has never indulged . in sports or other games , but occasionally enjoyed a goo4 cigitr : " ' - I have left out the international aspects of the passport nuisance . The mass- of mutual irritation between individuals of one state and officials of another ought to be weighed ; but for the space of this article I have tried to consider only the relation of the American to his own gov-ernment , and more particularly the government 's attitude to the individual , as summed up let us say by a little dia-logue between one American ( not myself ) and his consul . The American , gently : " Forty dollars is a bit heavy for ( passport and visa fees for ) a little trip of six weeks . " Consul : " Aw ! We dun ' care wether yuh trevul er not . " In the Driftway D URING one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steppe beside the muddy river Kuma , when he saw a red rooster for the first time . If he were pressed the Drifter would have to admit that he had seen the species red rooster at other times and places ; yet he repeats that he saw it that day for the first time , displayed against its right and inevitable background . It was in the mud season between winter and spring , after the snow had left the steppe and before the tulips have sprung up among the wheat , when the great plain is a flat sea of sticky , black ooze . Here and there rise out of it villages consisting of rows of identical huts , also made of mud . Occasionally a peasant is to be seen moving about on it , but not unless his errand is unavoidable , for the task of lifting a foot from the ground is too painful to repeat often . ghe peasants sit by their stoves at this season and make toys and embroideries and look out of their doorways , or if they are very rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cloud-ceiling shows signs of lifting . And they might look out to see a neighbor or a red rooster. * * * T HE tail of the rooster which the Drifter saw for the first time was curved like a fountain , and made of long , supple feathers in a rusty shade of red . His throat was sleekly furred with tiny feathers overlaid like tiles , in a proud arched line . His rose-red crest- made a dissonance with the russet which was arresting and oddly pleasing , always against the neutral monotone of the steppe . He strutted along beside the winding fissure of the Kuma , on slender red feet that hardly pricked the mud , arrogantly conscious of dominating the landscape and of being the father of Russian art . * * * I OOKING around for something beautiful to reproduce , 4 the first mujik artist might have seen mountains and waterfalls , but not unless he lived in the Caucasus . He might have seen flowers and birds , but he would have had no time to paint their pictures , seeing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the season when he had most time to spare for kustarni or handicraft , he would not have found a bit of life anywhere except his own domestic animals , and the only spot of color in his existence would have been his red rooster . So he painted the rooster on his wooden boxes , and his wife embroidered the rooster on her towels and iron-pieces in various poses  --  parading the ridgepole of the cottage , extending a foot in a commanding gesture , wings spread in flight . All this was in crude scarlet and black  --  it was peasant art . , ? ; ? N OW mount a few degrees in the scale of evolution . Look at the paintings of sophisticated Russian artists . What distinguishes them most strikingly from their counterparts in other countries ? Their frequent juxtaposition of orange-red and rose , their swirling curves and spirals  --  the colors of the rooster on the steppe and the lines of his plumage . Other subjects by this time have taken their share of the field , but the rooster motif recurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'Or symbolized nothing less than the sun ; the related fable of the Firebird ran through stories and songs before it became Strawinski 's famous ballet . Other countries , too , have roosters , the Drifter admits ; there are French national emblems and chanteclers and Spanish cock-fights . But there is something thrifty and domestic about a French chantecler , something brutal and perverted about a fighting-cock . Nowhere else does the bird dominate with such pomp and dignity , yes , majesty , as in Russia . THE DRIFTER Correspondence The New Pacifism To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : A few days ago Dr. D. P. Barrows , president of the University of California , spoke openly in a newspaper here in support of intervention in Mexico . He is the man who has been chosen by the Carnegie Foundation to go to South America as a peace emissary next year . Berkeley , California , November 1 PETER GULDBRANDSEN On Irish Films To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Mr. Broun condemns the protest against screen caricatures of the Irish race because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow that , because my neighbor refrains from protesting against damage done his property by ruffians , I must be condemned when I protest against damage to mine ? He condemns the protest because Irishmen of a past generation seemed to enjoy the sentimental , totally unreal stage Irishman of the Chauncey Olcott type , preferring it to the drunken pig-in-the-parlor stage-Irishman of an earlier period , now being revived on the screen in such productions as " The Callahans and the Murphys . " But the Olcott characters were a decided improvement upon their predecessors . Finally , Mr. Broun condemns the protest on the ground that Irish-Americans protested violently against " The Playboy of the Western World , " pronounced by the critics a masterpiece , upon its first presentation and then did not protest when the play was revived . But this is not unusual in the history of literature . The critics might even flatter themselves that they had educated public taste ! Mr. Broun has overlooked the salient feature of this protest . While our writers may , at times , depict other nationalities as vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented as being abnormal or subnormal . They may be sentimental fools or vicious fools , but , never normal human beings . What popular writer would depict his Irish characters otherwise than eccentric , asinine , ignorant , or vulgar ? If by their protest this committee can rid the stage and screen of even a modicum of the banalities , vulgarities , and indecencies with which a tame , submissive public has too long been flooded it deserves the heartfelt gratitude of every American who seeks entertainment not filth in the theater .
