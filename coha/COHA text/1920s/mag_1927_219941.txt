THE WIND OF COMPLICATION- Susan Ertz-Appleton ( $2 ) . Once upon a time one furnished one 's overnight guest with fiddlers to lull him to sleep . Now it is considered sufficient if guest-rooms contain a reachable reading-in-bed-lamp and , better than a novel , a book of short stories . The author of Madame Claire and After Noon now supplies a collection to which no hostess need hesitate to call attention before saying at the door , " Well , goodnight . " <P> Miss Ertz will send people off to sleep ( but not before they firmly decide to go ) with a sense of emotional security and superiority . She is a knowing lady and very cool . Scarcely anyone can handle emotional characters with her legerity and yet not be trifling . Two of her lovely ladies , for example , tour France with a charming philanderer . They find him out in time to save their friendship and in a manner that saves their self-respect . Yet just before the climax , tragedy impends . In another story , the mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing her own work under his name . The son 's character does not change , but the mother is much happier . Again : A dullish Mr. Mellish , given to heroine-worship , is taught his wife 's heroism . An over-intense beauty kills two husbands with her love and ambition for them . . . . The normal living pitch implied by Miss Ertz reminds one of Bertrand Russell 's " good life . " But just to show what she can imagine , a horror story is also included , blacker than bats .
