txt There is a general idea that William Allen White of Emporia , Kan , is n't afraid of rinything . But Miss Lorraine Elizabeth Wooster , former superintendent of the Kansas schools , yesterday declared Mr. White is , or at least was , afraid of two things : ciipireL EUTIOKer4 .. Second , that some one might call him a sissy . Bliss Waster spoke yesterday at a meeting of the Advisory Council of the Boys and Girls ' Anti-Cigaret league held at the Union League club . Her league is engaged in the task of calling attention to " the rapidly growing menace of the cigaret habit among boys and girls . " In 1921 Miss Wooster called on Mr. White to say a word in favor of enforcement of tho Kansas antl  --  cigdret law , Which since has been repealed . She was then trying to stop the boot-1 leggers of smokes from doing business . As she quoted the journalist , his reply was : " I do n't want to do that I do n't want to be termed a sissy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason for Mr. White 's defeat when running for governor three years later , she intimated that it cost him a great many votes . " When the man who was too cowardly to Stand for obedience of our statutes ran for governor , " she said , " I determined that he should not carry his own county . He lost the county , he lost nearly every precinct in his town , Emporia. , and he would have lost his oWn precinct if I had hat " more time to work . Never again , while I live , will he run for governor , of Kansas . " Besides Mr. White , the medical profession caught the most bitter of the criticisms made by the council . Er . Bertha Van Hoosen , professor of obstetrics at Loyola university , declared that physicians often told prospective mothers they would n't be harmed by moderate smoking . She added that any woman who smoked cigarets could poison her baby as well as herself . A demonstration of the chemical components of tobacco smoke was given by Alice Hyatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three drops of liquefied smoke held eighteen poisons and would kill a snake in sixty seconds , While a guinea pig , having been given only a few drops , could survive only an hour and a half .
