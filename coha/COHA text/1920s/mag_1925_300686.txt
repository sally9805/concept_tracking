Dr. Peter Ainslie , head of the Christian Temple in Baltimore , received a letter inviting him to become a trustee of the Bryan Memorial University , to be erected by an association of the same name at Dayton , Tenn. , scene of the Commoner 's last struggle . He replied refusing the nomination : <P> " I feel that his closing days could have been better spent than in the field to which he unreservedly gave himself . <P> " I feel that in the matter of education it is as unfortunate to have schools such as that which your community is planning to start as it is to have denominational schools . Neither has a place in modern education . "
