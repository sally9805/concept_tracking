TO RETURN to a sore subject , the pay-as-you-enter bus regulation gets more disagreeable as time goes on . Any one who approves of the idea should try getting on a bus on a rainy day . The vehicle is practically empty . The platform is crowded . You wait in the mud while a man gets a five-dollar bill changed . Everybody grumbles . In the press the conductor is unable to see if everybody is safely aboard and rings the bell , leaving you in the street , or dragging you forward , half on and half off . If you manage to get on you say to him that you think the arrangement unpleasant . He says , " Well , it 's easier for us . " Only when you sit down do you see a ray of hope . A placard says the company intends to let patrons vote for or against pay-as-you-enter . It is to be hoped that , if this is not a bluff , the conductors will not be the ones who collect and turn in the ballots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first night with the seats priced at a hundred dollars has become a memory . How many people , if any , bought seats we do not know , but we do know that a great , great many go free to openings , being editors , critics , politicians , or friends . We have one of those $100 tickets . It looks like gold , but we have bitten it and found it is only pasteboard . While we were wondering why Mr. Carroll did n't mark his tickets a thousand dollars , we learned that the Marx Brothers had announced ten thousand as the price of their next opening . THERE is always something new under the sun . This time it is a new reason for not keeping an engagement . We encountered the lady concerned some while afterward and asked the inevitable question .

" PROGRESS continues . They are putting through a state road along the top of the Palisades and down to Nyack , cutting down magnificent trees as they go with a ruthlessness that arouses indignation . This is unfortunate enough , but there is a worse evil attacking this particular bit of rurality . One of the oldest inhabitants , to whom it was observed that the quiet was refreshing , shrugged his shoulders dubiously . " It used to be , but now there 's so many aeroplanes going up the Hudson ? " It is worth a thought that this complaint about flying machines overhead is likely to he a general one within a decade or so .

ASTORY IS TOLD of an amia- ble fellow named Mahlon Blaine , sailor , artist , and man about the world , THE NEW YORKER and of his adventures in hunting the now famous New Jersey leopard . At once , on the announcement of the leopard 's escape , Blaine went to Columbia and obtained the services of two Malay students there , experienced " beaters " on their native peninsula . Then he went to Bridgeport and got two Sumatran gazelle hounds ; then to a certain tramp schooner in dock where he obtained some big-game rifles . And thus , completely equipped , he entered the Jersey jungles . Preceded by the Malay boys , beating gongs in the traditional manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild meat , and followed by two men with elephant guns , he set forth , confident that his methods could not fail . ' THEIR first encounter was with a THEI of forty East Siders , busily strewing the landscape with near-beer bottles . Next they got into difficulties with a regiment or two of troops , also looking for the canny leopard . All of a Saturday night they pressed forward , circling trees carefully , beating the gongs . After one interval of four or five hours following a fresh trail , they eventually treed an animal , let fire with an elephant gun , and killed a house cat . A few more hours were spent with the hounds hot on another scent  --  ending up at a fox 's earth . Finally the professionals gave up and put their money on the amateurs . Contact WITH the National Aeronautical V V Exhibit resuscitating the SesquiCentennial these weeks , we have renewed our inquiries as to where all the airplanes are going which seem to use the Hudson as a " green line . " And our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York has at its disposal an air-taxi service . All you have to do is call Garden City 1580 and a Curtiss amphibian will meet you at any pier on the Hudson by the time you can get to that pier in a mere land taxi . At least fifty planes are operated in the vicinity by fifteen companies , so it is no wonder that we are wakened every morning by the hum of propellers . The Curtiss Flying Service alone , with a fleet of sixteen planes , carries approximately 4,000 passengers a year , with a mileage of 170,000 , according to that amiable and well informed organization the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce over on Madison Avenue , which , we discovered , has been for years fostering the strenuous art of flying all over these States . The Curtiss-Metropolitan Airplane Company , they say , operates the amphibians and seaplanes which pick up passengers or freight at piers and take them to the nearest landing field , where the transfer is made to land machines . Two enterprising firms , in fact , advertise this service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAlpin Hotel . The Columbia Yacht Club pier at Eighty-second Street is the favorite landing space on the Hudson . DURING August the Curtiss amphibians were operated daily between Port Washington and Saratoga , up the Hudson . In addition to racing forms , etc. , passengers were carried at fifty dollars a head ( each way ) , the plane leaving West Eighty-second Street at six A.M. Otherwise the rate is approximately a dollar a mile , although " hops , " equivalent to a turn around the park in a land taxi , are five dollars . Generally the trip must he made to the nearest landing field ( Garden City or Westbury , Long Island ) by car or train ; but no other preparation is necessary , since the proper equipment of flying suit , goggles , and the like , is always available at the hangars for extended trips . The General Airways System is another leader , operating with seven planes : and one of them alone , Sikorsky 's huge sixteen-passenger twinmotored plane Yorktown , carried 4,000 passengers during the last year ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freight . If you want a ride on this big bird , call Circle 10177 and make a reservation . RESIDES these private commercial 1-A lines , three daily mail routes operate out of the city : the Transcontinental , leaving Hadley Field , New Brunswick , New Jersey , every morning for Chicago and the West Coast ; the Overnight to Chicago every evening ; and the Colonial , which has been in operation only a month , and carries mail from New York to Boston . Fifteen red-whiteand-blue striped special air-mail boxes , scattered all the way from Broadway and Wall Street to the Grand Central Station , facilitate this service , but we have never yet seen any one put a letter into one of them . However , we are told that any mail box will do , although the service may not be so expeditious . A letter which requires two cents in the ordinary mail , goes for twenty-five cents through the air  --  and a special air-mail stamp is not necessary any more than a special delivery stamp , if " Air Mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hit by a 1 truck was carried into an uptown drug store and after receiving first-aid treatment still showed signs of being in pain .

" Mr. Taft 's Murray Bay AS HE has done for twenty-five out of the last thirty-five years , Mr. William Howard Taft has been spending the summer at Murray Bay in Quebec . His sixty-ninth birthday on September 15 will find him looking some years less than that , a little less stout than he once was , but as jovial and as much a part of the Canadian colony as ever . Earlier in the summer he was ill , but now one again sees him on the golf course , which skirts the St. Lawrence River , and hears him laughing easily and heartily at a good shot , exclaiming " Piffle " or " Posh " at a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW YORKER 9 as his brother 's , is between the railroad on the shore and the highway higher up the side of the hill . The porch overlooks the river , which is twelve miles wide at Pointe au Pic . The Chief Justice is almost an unofficial mayor of Murray Bay . His interest is deep in this smaller scale Newport of Canada . One realizes it when seeing him stroll with Mrs. Taft down the main street and past the two general merchandise stores . His stops to chat about this and that are numerous , but it is noteworthy that they are almost exclusively with the older generation . A great many of the younger generation do not recognize the only living ex-President of the United States . As a matter of fact he has but to return to his cottage to be very much in the younger set . Almost always one or more of his three children are there and most of his ten grandchildren . His life is quite simple ; in his establishment there are his secre tary and a few well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Governor General Byng 's equipage . Canada 's ruler is no. believer in President Coolidge 's theory of traveling in a compartment . He comes to Murray Bay in his private train of six or seven cars , with a staff of twenty-six , ranging from his First Secretary to the vice-assistant door-opener . Train and staff are parked on a siding while he removes to his cottage . THE Governor General 's entour- age is a gem in the modest crown of Murray Bay . The colony has changed little in his time , or in ex-President Taft 's . One of the few social fortresses remaining on the continent , it is an unassuming stronghold , its arms an almost arrant simplicity , its chief breastwork its inaccessibility . Week-ends are unknown ; guests come for fortnights , each household carefully scheduling its summer . Canadians and Americans are numerically almost equal . There is an old-school air about the place . The gentle custom of picnics is preserved ; so also the dogcart . On the porch of each house overlooking the golf-course , hangs a telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and master when luncheon is on the table . There are polite dances at the hotel which last only until midnight . The two trains a day and the river steamer 's stop are events . Conversation is easy , intimate , and usually about golf . Biting the Hand f LEWELYN POWYS , in " The I  --  d Verdict of Bridlegoose , " charmingly refers to the Century Club as a " fortress of senile Philistines " and a place " where everybody is trying to live up to some objective standard of deportment which has its origin in the fussy , exacting taste of some wretched head-waiter . " Those English authors ! There is a sequel . A sister of the Powys brothers had asked a certain New Yorker to be nice to Llewelyn at a time when he had just returned from Africa . The gentleman was  --  dinners , etc. ? and one day had him to lunch at the Century Club , where he listened to Mr. Powys ' talk of himself and his books and finally suggested he 'd like to have Powys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " signed . Powys left and about fifteen minutes later a messenger came with not only this title but three books , and a bill for them : two by Llewelyn and one by his brother . Notes SO far as can he made out , Italians are of the happy minority who thoroughly enjoy Manhattan in summer . Every one in Little Italy spends his days and nights in the street and loves it . Business , sport , social calls , politics , love-making , quarrels , meals , rest , everything goes on in the streets or the gutters , on the sidewalks and curbs , in doorways or in windows as far out as possible . And a fiesta is held every few weeks . The most recent of the fiestas , we were fortunate enough to catch at its height on a Sunday - night . It was in honor of Santa Filomena . There was a parade of automobiles in which several red-fire pieces flared from each car . There were firecrackers and come-back balls and ticklers and confetti and serpentine . Houston Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with brilliant whorls of electric lights . Flags and Bunting decked the street above and gay booths lined both sides . . A male opera singer in a sailor hat which he removed two inches from his bead each time there was an ex- . ceptiorial burst of applause from the crowd that blocked the street , sang arias from " Fra Diavolo " with all the accepted gestures , as rivulets of perspiration coursed down from under the skimmer and ran into his eyes . A jazz band dispensed dance music on one side street where a " block party " had been going on for three nights ; a military band played frantically on another side street ; a ri d a brilliantly lighted shrine contained a resplendent figure of Filomena in tinsel robes reclining at full length upon a Parisian chaise-longue . FIRE escapes , made into oriental balconies by the use of lanterns , flowers and streamers of paper , were crowded with gayly clad celebrants as far up as six stories  --  with the intervening windows holding from one to three " leaners " each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic was completely blocked by the coatless crowd on the street . And when a miniature merry-go-round on a wagon drew up to a curb , there was a scramble and a fight for position such as no Marion Talley ever drew on an opening night at the Metropolitan . We thought this scramble was for first rides , but not at ail the little boys of the neighborhood were accepting black eyes cheerfully for the honor of turning the crank which made the merry-go-round go around ! In short , a periodic excursion into this section of the city almost always proves diverting and it is especially so now that roasting ears are steaming in enormous street kettles and wine presses of every size crowd the sidewalks in front of various shops and harvest festivals are due almost any moment . Old Order NCOUNTERING a friend fum-ing over his frustrated efforts to see a certain millionaire acquaintance even though he had an appointment , we were interested in his recollection of a visit in 1906 to Russell Sage 's office , only two blocks away from the labyrinthine and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found Sage in a dusty corner washing off the rim of a prehistoric derby with an old toothbrush . Russell Sage , the millionaire 's confidant went on , began his business life as an errand boy in his brother 's grocery store in Troy and finished it as president or other prominent officer of twenty-two railway and telegraph companies in New York City yet he used to ride downtown in one of the busses which went down Broadway to the foot of Wail Street . These busses were like big round beetles , drawn by two horses . Scorbutic drivers sat high in front and peered down through a hole to see that passengers paid their nickel fare . You could get six-fare tickets for a quarter . Russell Sage used to buy a quarter 's worth and frequently , it is said , he would sit near the deposit box and take the nickels from the passengers as they entered and then deposit tickets , thus profiting a nickel on every five fares . ANOTHER tale of the eccentric millionaire concerns his Elevated riding . We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former city editor of the Evening World . Sage and Chapin were going downtown together . They mounted the platform abreast , but at the gate Sage dashed ahead , showed a pass to the gateman and went on through . Chapin was left to fish for a nickel and buy a ticket . Afterward Sage explained , " I could have taken you in on my pass , too , but I did n't think it would be fair to the stockholders. " oasis APPARENTLY the eccentricities of our local construction jags are in a fair way toward setting up another oasis of private residences ; this newer Murray Hill being on the crest of the Park Avenue hill from Sixty-seventh to Seventieth . Below , the Seventh Regiment Armory shuts it off and , above , the prospect of a fortyTHE NEW YORKER 11 story apartment house on the old Presbyterian Hospital site seems about to provide a northern barrier . Mr. James T. Lee , who acquired fame by building the Shelton Hotel , is a member of the syndicate arranging this latter project . The crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the memory of those born since the McKinley era , associated always with substantiality . Nurse-maids patrolling the street were ever gorgeously uniformed and infant equipage glorious . As why not since the residents of the neighborhood include Percy R. Pyne , Judge Morgan J. O'Brien , the Honorable J. S. Frelinghuysen , Mrs. William Sloane , and similar puissant persons . obit ON a rainy day last week , when the newspapers belonged to Valentino , there was a seven-line notice in one newspaper which announced the simultaneous decease in New York , also through peritonitis , of Milton Feasley , another young man in his thirties , whose audience had been perhaps twice the size of the screen star 's . Mr. Feasley was the youthful father of halitosis . Also he was perhaps the most successful advertising man in this country . Once upon a time he graduated from a Chicago newspaper to write ads for Listerine , which excellent product nobody seemed particularly anxious to buy in those days . So Mr. Feasley spoke thus to his gaping sales force : " If you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have invited you to tea the next day except for your halitosis , would n't that be a good reason to use Listerine ? " The sales force agreed with him that it would . Whereupon , it is said , was horn the principle of advertising through fear , of telling people disagreeable truths about themselves . " Always a bridesmaid  --  never a bride . " " Even your best friend will not tell you . " Then down in the corner just one insidious little word  --  halitosis . Mr. Feasley celled it " whisper copy . " MILTON FEASLEY was of Polish extraction , a brother of Newton Fuessle , the novelist . Originally his name was Fuessle . He was a slender , immaculately tailored man , with prematurely gray hair . Possessing a strong dash of cynicism , the father of halitosis had a secret ambidon to write a novel . His private office was furnished rather as a drawing room , hut  --  despite this luxury  --  his firm last year did a business of five million dollars . Mr. Feasley 's cynicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wont solemnly to read aloud halitosis ads before parties at his partner 's home in Princeton , N. J. , where frequently a good laugh was had by all . Fear and vanity and such human emotions he played on , but it must be said that he persuaded millions to rinse their mouths and introduced sanitation where it had never been thought of before . Once Mr. Feasley was summoned before a censorship committee of advertising agencies . They accused him in a perfume advertisement of inventing the amorous successes of a certain young girl . The committee demanded that he produce an affidavit from the fair one to the effect that she actually had enslaved men by using this perfume . " You are quite right , gentlemen , " replied Mr. Feasley , " hut I too have a similar affidavit to demand . In another advertisement passed by you all I wish an affidavit from the ladies mentioned , to the effect that they are really contented . " He turned to the well known ad : " Milk from contented cows . " Misnomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago , we were happy to see , as we crossed Eleventh Avenue , horsemen still riding up and down and waving red lanterns in front of the slow-moving trains that puff up and down the river front . Each time we journey back we are afraid they will have been done away with , for they arc vestiges of an earlier day , the legislature 's arbitration between the interests of the railroads and the interests of safety . Being romantic , we hope they will continue until that far day when the tracks are elevated above the street . It is to Mr. Hearst , it will be remembered , that Eleventh Avenue owes its misnomer of " Death Avenue . " This as a result of innumerable dismal cartoons depicting the river-front street as a thoroughfare populated by demoniac locomotives bent on running over unhappy little babies . As a matter of fact , the locomotives are far from being the monsters Mr. Hearst depicted . Meek and slowly puffing , they go about their business with all the decorum of a middle-aged clerk . The mystei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight , into prosaic men on shaggy , plodding ponies , dutifully waving red flags . THE river front that they traverse continues to be one of Manhattan 's pleasantest strolling grounds . The brown wall of buildings to the east cuts off the city and gives one a feeling of isolation , the cobbled way is broad and the life of the water front , despite the efficient bleakness of the transatlantic docks , diverting . One can indulge in such adventures as boarding a liner about to sail , without the excuse of seeing a friend off , and promenade on the boat deck until the stewards ' gongs sound . Farther north , above Twenty-third Street , the way lies by less pretentious , and messier , nautical activities  --  freighters unloading , a windjammer or two , tugboats , lighters . The consciousness that New York is a seaport becomes more intense . Also the isolation . It is not until one emerges at Forty-second Street that he is re-enveloped by the thunderous bustle of traffic .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
