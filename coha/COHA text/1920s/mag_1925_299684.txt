In the remote fastnesses of Tennessee , where a high-school professor is arraigned under that state 's new anti-evolution law for having " taught evolution " from a biologic text-book previously approved by the state authorities ( TIME , May 18 ) , the forces of light and darkness ranged themselves for conflict . George W. Rappelyea , Dayton coal man and evolutionist , who preferred charges against Prof. Scopes to test the law 's constitutionality , marshaled funds for the defense , announced that , in addition to many eminent scientists who had offered assistance and testimony , the services of Herbert George Wells , British outliner of history , would be sought . Counsel for Prof. Scopes accepted offers of legal aid from Lawyers ' Dudley Field Malone ( suave Manhattan lawyer ) and Clarence Darrow ( Chicago criminal extricator ) . <P> The prosecution found a voluble champion in William Jennings Bryan , " great commoner . " Last week , Mr. Bryan was going the rounds of Eastern lecture platforms , emotionally crying that evolution is the arch foe , not only of Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to make the trial , at which he will speak , an onslaught on that system of education " that destroys the religious faith of our children . " <P> On this question , he seemed likely to debate alone . The issue of the trial as taken by the defense was not to be the futile question : " Is evolution true ? " but : " Can the human mind be limited by law in its inquiry after truth ? May freedom of teaching and freedom of learning be forbidden by law ? "
