The Curtain lifts on a place that is dark , save for a shaft of light from below which comes up through an open trap door in the floor . This slants up and strikes the long leaves and the huge brilliant blossom of a strange plant whose twisted stem projects from right front . Nothing is seen except this plant and its shadow . A violent wind is heard . A moment later a buzzer . It buzzes once long and three short . Silence . Again the buzzer . Then from below  --  his shadow blocking the light , comes Anthony , a rugged man past middle life ;  --  he emerges from the stairway into the darkness of the room . Is dimly seen taking up a phone . ANTHONY Yes , Miss Claire ?  --  I 'll see . He brings a thermometer to the stairway for light , looks sharply , then returns to the phone . It 's down to forty-nine . The plants are in danger  --  With great relief and approval . Oh , that 's fine ! Hangs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairway , closing the trap-door upon himself , and the curtain is drawn upon darkness and wind . It opens a moment later on the greenhouse in the sunshine of a snowy morning . The snow piled outside is at times blown through the air . The frost has made patterns on the glass as if  --  as Plato would have it  --  the patterns inherent in abstract nature and behind all life had to come out , not only in the creative heat within , but in the creative cold on the other side of the glass . And the wind makes patterns of sound around the glass house . The back wall is low ; the glass roof slopes sharply up . There is an outside door , a little toward the right . From outside two steps lead down to it . At left a glass partition and a door into the inner room . One sees a little way into this room . At right there is no dividing wall save large plants and vines , a narrow aisle between shelves of plants leads off . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the usual workshop for the growing of them , but a place for experiment with plants , a laboratory . At the back grows a strange vine . It is arresting rather than beautiful . It creeps along the low wall , and one branch gets a little way up the glass . You might see the form of a cross in it , if you happened to think it that way . The leaves of this vine are not the form that leaves have been . They are at once repellent and significant . Anthony is at work preparing soil  --  mixing , sifting . As the wind tries the door he goes anxiously to the thermometer , nods as if reassured and returns to his work . The buzzer sounds . He starts to answer the telephone , remembers something , halts and listens sharply . It does not buzz once long and three short . Then he returns to his work . The buzzer goes on and on in impatient jerks which mount in anger . Several times Anthony is almost compelled by this insistence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , after a particularly mad splutter , to which Anthony longs to make retort , the buzzer gives it up . Anthony goes on preparing soil . A moment later the glass door swings violently in , snow blowing in , and also Mr. Harry Archer , wrapped in a rug . p. 3 ANTHONY Oh , please close the door , sir . HARRY ARCHER Do you think I 'm not trying to ? He holds it open to say this . ANTHONY But please do . This stormy air is not good for the plants . HARRY ARCHER I suppose it 's just the thing for me ! Now , what do you mean , Anthony , by not answering the phone when I buzz for you ? ANTHONY Miss Claire  --  Mrs. Archer told me not to . HARRY ARCHER Told you not to answer me ? ANTHONY Not you especially  --  nobody but her . HARRY ARCHER Well I like her nerve  --  and yours . ANTHONY You see , she thought it took my mind from my work to be interrupted when I 'm out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once long and  --  Well , she buzzes her way , and all other buzzing  --  HARRY ARCHER May buzz . ANTHONY Nodding gravely . She thought it would be better for the flowers . HARRY ARCHER I am not a flower  --  true , but I too need a little attention  --  and a little heat . Will you please tell me why the house is frigid ? p. 4 ANTHONY Miss Claire ordered all the heat turned out here . Patiently explaining it to Miss Claire 's speechless husband . You see the roses need a great deal of heat . HARRY ARCHER Reading the thermometer . The roses have seventy-three . I have forty-five . ANTHONY Yes , the roses need seventy-three . HARRY ARCHER Anthony , this is an outrage ! ANTHONY I think it is myself ; when you consider what we paid for that heating plant  --  but as long as it is defective  --  Why , Miss Claire would never have done what she has if she had n't looked out for her plants in just such ways as this . Have you forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHER And where 's my breakfast about to flower  --  that 's what I want to know . ANTHONY Why Miss Claire got up at five o'clock to order the heat turned off from the house . HARRY ARCHER I see you admire her vigilance . ANTHONY Oh , I do . Fervently . I do . Harm was near , and that woke her up . p. 5 HARRY ARCHER And what about the harm to  --  Tapping his chest . Do roses get pneumonia ? ANTHONY Oh , yes  --  yes indeed they do . Why , Mr. Archer , look at Miss Claire herself . Has n't she given her heat to the roses ? HARRY ARCHER Pulling the rug around him , preparing for the blizzard . She has the fire within . ANTHONY Delighted . Now is n't that true ! How well you said it . With a glare for this appreciation , Harry opens the door . It blows away from him . Please do close the door ! HARRY ARCHER Furiously . You think it is the aim of my life to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things need an even temperature . While saying this he gets the man out into the snow . Anthony consults the thermometer , not as pleased this time as he was before . He then looks minutely at two of the plants  --  one is a rose , the other a flower without a name because it has not long enough been a flower . Peers into the hearts of them . Then from a drawer under a shelf , takes two paper bags , puts one over each of these flowers , closing them down at the bottom . Again the door blows wildly in , also Hattie , a maid with a basket . p. 6 ANTHONY What do you mean  --  blowing in here like this ! Mrs. Archer has ordered  --  HATTIE Mr. Archer has ordered breakfast served here . She uncovers the basket and takes out an electric toaster . ANTHONY Breakfast  --  here ? Eat  --  here ? Where plants grow ? HATTIE The plants wo n't poison him , will they ? At a loss to know what to do with things , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose leaves lift up against the glass which has frost leaves on the outer side . ANTHONY Snatching it away . You  --  you think you can cook eggs under the Edge Vine ? HATTIE I guess Mr. Archer 's eggs are as important as a vine . I guess my work 's as important as yours . ANTHONY There 's a million people like you  --  and like Mr. Archer . In all the world there is only one Edge Vine . HATTIE Well , maybe one 's enough . It do n't look like nothin ' anyhow . ANTHONY And you 've not got the wit to know that that 's why it 's the Edge Vine . p. 7 HATTIE You want to look out , Anthony . You talk nutty . Everybody says so . ANTHONY Miss Claire do n't say so . HATTIE No , because she 's  --  ANTHONY You talk too much ! Door opens , admitting Harry , with a thermos bottle . ANTHONY Please close  --  Harry halts his attempt at closing the door to give Anthony a look . Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best place to eat breakfast , moves a box of earth from the table . HARRY ARCHER Just give me a hand , will you , Hattie ? They bring it to the open space and he and Hattie arrange breakfast things , Hattie with triumphant glances at the distressed Anthony . ANTHONY Deciding he must act . Mr. Archer , this is not the place to eat breakfast ! HARRY ARCHER Dead wrong , old boy . The place that has heat is the place to eat breakfast . To Hattie . Tell the other gentlemen  --  I heard Mr. Demming up , and Mr. Edgeworthy , if he appears , that as long as it is such a pleasant morning , we 're having breakfast outside . To the conservatory for coffee . Hattie giggles , is leaving . And let 's see , have we got everything ? Takes the one shaker , shakes a little pepper on his hand . Looks in vain for the other shaker . And tell Mr. Demming to bring the salt . p. 8 ANTHONY Mr. Archer , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a bulb and attaching the toaster . Then why do you ? ANTHONY But Miss Claire will be very angry . HARRY ARCHER I am very angry . Did I choose to eat my breakfast at the other end of a blizzard ? ANTHONY An exclamation of horror at the thermometer . The temperature is falling . I must report . He punches the buzzer , takes up the phone . Miss Claire ? It is Anthony . A terrible thing has happened . Mr. Archer  --  what ? Yes , a terrible thing  --  Yes , it is about Mr. Archer  --  No  --  no , not dead . But here . He is here . Yes , he is well , he seems well , but he is eating his breakfast . Yes , he is having breakfast served out here  --  for himself , and the other gentlemen are to come too  --  Well , he seemed to be annoyed because the heat had been turned off from the house . But the door keeps opening  --  this stormy wind blowing right over the plants . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you would want to come . Anthony opens the trap door and goes below . Harry looks disapprovingly down into this openness at his feet , returns to his breakfast . Anthony comes up , bearing a box . p. 9 HARRY ARCHER Turning his face away . Phew ! What a smell . ANTHONY Yes . Fertilizer has to smell . HARRY ARCHER Well it does n't have to smell up my breakfast ! ANTHONY With a patient sense of order . The smell belongs here . He and the smell go to the inner room . The outer door opens just enough to admit Claire  --  is quickly closed . With Claire in a room another kind of aliveness is there . CLAIRE ARCHER What are you doing here ? HARRY ARCHER Getting breakfast . All the while doing so . CLAIRE ARCHER I 'll not have you in my place ! HARRY ARCHER If you take all the heat then you have to take me . CLAIRE ARCHER I 'll show you how I have to take you . With her hands begins scooping upon him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , pinning down her arms , putting his arms around her . Claire  --  be decent . What harm do I do here ? p. 10 CLAIRE ARCHER You pull down the temperature . HARRY ARCHER Not after I 'm in . CLAIRE ARCHER And you told Tom and Dick to come and make it uneven . HARRY ARCHER Tom and Dick are our guests . We ca n't eat where it 's warm and leave them to eat where it 's cold . CLAIRE ARCHER I do n't see why not . HARRY ARCHER You only see what you want to see . CLAIRE ARCHER That 's not true . I wish it were . No ; no , I do n't either . She is disturbed  --  that troubled thing which rises from within , from deep , and takes Claire . She turns to the Edge Vine , examines . Regretfully to Anthony , who has come in with a plant . It 's turning back , is n't it ? ANTHONY Can you be sure yet , Miss Claire ? CLAIRE ARCHER Oh yes  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be  --  what has n't been . HARRY ARCHER Who has turned at this note in her voice . Speaks kindly . Do n't take it so seriously , Claire . Claire laughs . p. 11 CLAIRE ARCHER No , I suppose not . But it does matter  --  and why should I pretend it does n't , just because I 've failed with it ? HARRY ARCHER Well , I do n't want to see it get you  --  it 's not important enough for that . CLAIRE ARCHER In her brooding way . Anything is important enough for that  --  if it 's important at all . To the rine . I thought you were out , but you 're  --  going back home . ANTHONY But you 're doing it this time , Miss Claire . When Breath of Life opens  --  and we see its heart  --  Claire looks toward the inner room . Because of intervening plants they do not see what is seen from the front  --  a plant like caught motion , and of a greater transparency than plants have had . Its leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not seen . This plant stands by itself in what , because of the arrangement of things about it , is a hidden place . But nothing is between it and the light . CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , if the heart has a little laugh held its own , then Breath of Life is alive in its otherness . But Edge Vine is running back to what it broke out of . p. 12 HARRY ARCHER Come have some coffee , Claire . Anthony returns to the inner room , the outer door opens , Dick is hurled in . CLAIRE ARCHER Going to the door , as he gasps for breath before closing it . How dare you make my temperature uneven ! She shuts the door and leans against it . DEMMING Is that what I do ? A laugh , a look between them , which is held into significance . HARRY ARCHER Who is not facing them . Where 's the salt ? DEMMING Oh , I fell down in the snow . I must have left the salt where I fell . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the temperature ? We do n't need salt . HARRY ARCHER You do n't need salt , Claire . But we eat eggs . CLAIRE ARCHER I must tell you I do n't like the idea of any food being eaten here , where things have their own way to go . Please eat as little as possible , and as quickly . HARRY ARCHER A hostess calculated to put one at one 's ease . p. 13 CLAIRE ARCHER With no ill-nature . I care nothing about your ease . Or about Dick 's ease . DEMMING And no doubt that 's what makes you so fascinating a hostess . CLAIRE ARCHER Was I a fascinating hostess last night , Dick ? Softly sings . " Oh , night of love  --  " From the Barcarole of Tales of Hoffman . HARRY ARCHER We 've got to have salt . He starts for the door . Claire slips in ahead of him , locks it , takes the key . He marches off right . CLAIRE ARCHER Calling after him . That end 's always locked . DEMMING Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . You do get away with it , but I confess it gives me a shock  --  and really , it 's unwise . CLAIRE ARCHER Have n't you learned that the best place to hide is in the truth ? As Harry returns . Why wo n't you believe me , Harry , when I tell you the truth  --  about doors being locked ? HARRY ARCHER Claire , it 's selfish of you to keep us from eating salt just because you do n't eat salt . p. 14 CLAIRE ARCHER With one of her swift changes . Oh , Harry ! Try your egg without salt . Please  --  Please try it without salt ! An intensity which seems all out of proportion to the subject . HARRY ARCHER An egg demands salt . CLAIRE ARCHER " An egg demands salt . " Do you know , Harry , why you are such an unseasoned person ? " An egg demands salt . " HARRY ARCHER Well , it does n't always get it . CLAIRE ARCHER But your spirit gets no lift from the salt withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his breakfast . CLAIRE ARCHER And pleased  --  so pleased with itself , for getting no lift . Sure it is just the right kind of spirit  --  because it gets no lift . More brightly . But , Dick , you must have tried your egg without salt . DEMMING I 'll try it now . He goes to the breakfast table . CLAIRE ARCHER You must have tried and tried things . Is n't that the way one leaves the normal , and gets into the byways of perversion . p. 15 HARRY ARCHER Claire . DEMMING Pushing back his egg . If so , I prefer to wait for the salt . HARRY ARCHER Claire , there is a limit . CLAIRE ARCHER Precisely what I had in mind . To perversion too there is a limit . So  --  the fortifications are unassailable . If one ever does get out , I suppose it is  --  quite unexpectedly , and perhaps  --  a bit terribly . HARRY ARCHER Get out where ? CLAIRE ARCHER With a bright smile . Where you , darling , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , had better beat it . CLAIRE ARCHER I wish I could . To herself . No  --  no I do n't either . Again this troubled thing turns her to the plants . She puts by themselves the two which Anthony covered with paper bags . Is about to remove these papers . Harry strikes a match . CLAIRE ARCHER Turning sharply . You ca n't smoke here . The plants are not used to it . p. 16 HARRY ARCHER Then I should think smoking would be just the thing for them . CLAIRE ARCHER There is design . HARRY ARCHER To Dick . Am I supposed to be answered ? I never can be quite sure at what moment I am answered . They both watch Claire , who has uncovered the plants and is looking intently into the flowers . From a drawer she takes some tools . Very carefully gives the rose pollen to an unfamiliar flower  --  rather wistfully unfamiliar , which stands above on a small shelf near the door of the inner room . DEMMING What is this you 're doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEMMING It 's all rather mysterious , is n't it ? HARRY ARCHER And Claire does n't make it any less so . CLAIRE ARCHER Can I make life any less mysterious ? HARRY ARCHER If you know what you are doing , why ca n't you tell Dick ? DEMMING Never mind . After all , why should I be told ? He turns away . At that she wants to tell him . Helpless , as one who can not get across a stream , starts uncertainly . p. 17 CLAIRE ARCHER I want to give fragrance to Breath of Life  --  Faces the room beyond the wall of glass.  --  the flower I 've created that is outside what flowers have been . What has gone out should bring fragrance from what it has left . But no definite fragrance , no limiting enclosing thing . I call the fragrance I am trying to create  --  Reminiscence . Her hand on the pot of the wistful little flower she has just given pollen . Reminiscent of the rose , the violet , arbutus  --  but a new thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what has n't been . Perhaps some day I can give it reminiscence . DEMMING I see , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER I wonder if you do . HARRY ARCHER Now , Claire , you 're going to be gay today , are n't you ? These are Tom 's last couple of days with us . CLAIRE ARCHER That does n't make me especially gay . HARRY ARCHER Well , you want him to remember you as yourself , do n't you ? CLAIRE ARCHER I would like him to . Oh  --  I would like him to ! HARRY ARCHER Then be amusing . That 's really you , is n't it Dick ? p. 18 DEMMING Not quite all of her  --  I should say . CLAIRE ARCHER Gayly . Careful , Dick . Are n't you indiscreet ? Harry will be suspecting that I am your latest strumpet . HARRY ARCHER Claire ! What language you use ! A person knowing you only by certain moments could never be made to believe you are a refined woman . CLAIRE ARCHER True , is n't it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lark to let them listen in at times  --  then tell them that here is the flower of New England ! CLAIRE ARCHER Well , if this is the flower of New England , then the half has never been told . DEMMING About New England ? CLAIRE ARCHER I thought I meant that . Perhaps I meant  --  about me . HARRY ARCHER Going on with his own entertainment . Explain that this is what came of the men who made the laws that made New England , that here is the flower of those gentlemen of culture who  --  DEMMING Moulded the American mind ! p. 19 CLAIRE ARCHER Oh ! It is pain . HARRY ARCHER Now what 's the matter ? CLAIRE ARCHER I want to get away from them ! HARRY ARCHER Rest easy , little one  --  you do . CLAIRE ARCHER I 'm not so sure  --  that I do . But it can be done ! We need not be held in forms molded for us . There is outness  --  and otherness . HARRY ARCHER Now , Claire  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; you never mean to do that . I want to break it up ! I tell you , I want to break it up ! If it were all in pieces , we 'd be A little laugh shocked to aliveness  --  To Dick would n't we ? There would be strange new comings together  --  mad new comings together , and we would know what it is to be born , and then we might know  --  that we are . Smash it . Her hand is near an egg . As you 'd smash an egg . She pushes the egg over the edge of the table and leans over and looks , as over a precipice . HARRY ARCHER With a sigh . Well , all you 've smashed is the egg , and all that amounts to is that now Tom gets no egg . So that 's that . p. 20 CLAIRE ARCHER With difficulty , drawing herself back from the fascination of the precipice . You think I ca n't smash anything ? You think life ca n't break up , and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form in which you found yourself , you think that 's all there is to the whole adventure ? And that is called sanity . And made a virtue  --  to lock one in . You never worked with things that grow ! Things that take a sporting chance  --  go mad  --  that sanity may n't lock them in  --  from life untouched  --  from life  --  that waits . She turns toward the inner room . Breath of Life . She goes in there . HARRY ARCHER Oh , I wish Claire would n't be strange like that . Helplessly . What is it ? What 's the matter ? DEMMING It 's merely the excess of a particularly rich temperament . HARRY ARCHER But it 's growing on her . I sometimes wonder if all this  --  Indicating the place around him. is a good thing . It would be all right if she 'd just do what she did in the beginning  --  make the flowers as good as possible of their kind . That 's an awfully nice thing for a woman to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  changing things into other things  --  putting things together and making queer new things  --  this  --  p. 21 DEMMING Creating ? HARRY ARCHER Give it any name you want it to have  --  it 's unsettling for a woman . They say Claire 's a shark at it , but what 's the good of it , if it gets her ? What is the good of it , anyway ? Suppose we can produce new things . Lord  --  look at the old ones we 've got . Looks outside ; turns back . Heavens , what a noise the wind does make around this place . But now it is not all the wind , but Tom Edgeworthy , who is trying to let himself in at the locked door , their backs are to him . I want my egg . You ca n't eat an egg without salt . I must say I do n't get Claire lately . I 'd like to have Charlie Emmons see her  --  he 's fixed up a lot of people shot to pieces in the war . Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would irritate her ? DEMMING She 'd probably get no little entertainment out of it . HARRY ARCHER Yes , dog-gone her , she would . Tom now takes more heroic measures to make himself heard at the door . Funny  --  how the wind can fool you . Now by not looking around I could imagine  --  why I could imagine anything . Funny , is n't it , about imagination ? And Claire says I have n't got any ! p. 22 DEMMING It would make an amusing drawing  --  what the wind makes you think is there . First makes forms with his hands , then leveling the soil prepared by Anthony , traces lines with his finger . Yes , really  --  quite jolly . Tom , after a moment of peering in at them , smiles , goes away . HARRY ARCHER You 're another one of the queer ducks , are n't you ? Come now  --  give me the dirt . Have you queer ones really got anything  --  or do you just put it over on us that you have ? Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , I guess you 're wise there . If you keep mum  --  how we going to prove there 's nothing there ? DEMMING I do n't keep mum . I draw . HARRY ARCHER Lines that do n't make anything  --  how can they tell you anything ? Well , all I ask is , do n't make Claire queer . Claire 's a first water good sport  --  really , so do n't encourage her to be queer . DEMMING Trouble is , if you 're queer enough to be amusing , it might  --  open the door to queerness . HARRY ARCHER Now do n't say things like that to Claire . DEMMING I do n't have to . p. 23 HARRY ARCHER Then you think she 's queer , do you ? Queer as you are , you think she 's queer . I would like to have Dr. Emmons come out . After a moment of silently watching Dick , who is having a good time with his drawing . You know , frankly , I doubt if you 're a good influence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I do n't worry a bit about  --  things a husband might worry about . I suppose an intellectual woman  --  and for all Claire 's hate on her ancestors , she 's got the bug herself . Why she has times of boring into things until she does n't know you 're there . What do you think I caught her doing the other day ? Reading Latin . Well  --  a woman that reads Latin need n't worry a husband much . DEMMING They said a good deal in Latin . HARRY ARCHER But I was saying , I suppose a woman who lives a good deal in her mind never does have much  --  well , what you might call passion . Uses the word as if it should n't be used . Brows knitted , is looking ahead , does not see Dick 's face . Turning to him with a laugh . I suppose you know pretty much all there is to know about women ? DEMMING Perhaps one or two details have escaped me. p. 24 HARRY ARCHER Well , for that matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and not know much about Claire . But now about  --  does not want to say passion again  --  oh , feeling  --  Claire has a certain  --  well , a certain  --  DEMMING Irony ? HARRY ARCHER Which is really more  --  more  --  DEMMING More fetching , perhaps . HARRY ARCHER Yes ! Than the thing itself . But of course  --  you would n't have much of a thing that you have irony about . DEMMING Oh  --  would n't you ! I mean  --  a man might . HARRY ARCHER I 'd like to talk to Edgeworthy about Claire . But it 's not easy to talk to Tom about Claire  --  or to Claire about Tom . DEMMING Alert . They 're very old friends , are n't they ? HARRY ARCHER Why  --  yes , they are . Though they 've not been together much of late years , Edgeworthy always going to the ends of the earth to  --  meditate about something . I must say I do n't get it . If you have a place  --  that 's the place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  best kind of family connections , and it was a very good business his father left him . Publishing business  --  in good shape , too , when old Edgeworthy died . I would n't call Tom a great success in life  --  but Claire does listen to what he says . p. 25 DEMMING Yes , I 've noticed that . HARRY ARCHER So , I 'd like to get him to tell her to quit this queer business of making things grow that never grew before . DEMMING But are you sure that 's what he would tell her . Is n't he in the same business himself ? HARRY ARCHER Why he does n't raise anything . Tom is again at the door . DEMMING Anyway I think he might have some idea that we ca n't very well reach each other . HARRY ARCHER Damn nonsense . What have we got intelligence for ? DEMMING To let each other alone , I suppose . Only we have n't enough to do it . Tom is now knocking on the door with a revolver . Harry half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY ARCHER Do n't tell me I 'm getting nerves . But the way some of you people talk is enough to make even an aviator jumpy . Ca n't reach each other ! Then we 're fools . If I 'm here and you 're there why ca n't we reach each other ? DEMMING Because I am I and you are you . HARRY ARCHER No wonder your drawing 's queer . A man who ca n't reach another man  --  Tom here reaches them by pointing the revolver in the air and firing it . Dick digs his hand into the dirt . Harry jumps to one side , fearfully looks around . Tom , with a pleased smile to see he at last has their attention , moves the handle to indicate he would be glad to come in. p. 26 HARRY ARCHER Why  --  it 's Tom ! What the  --  ? Going to the door . He 's locked out . And Claire 's got the key . Goes to the inner door , tries it . And she 's locked in ! Trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the outer door . Claire 's got the key  --  and I ca n't get to Claire . Makes a futile attempt at getting the door open without a key , goes back to inner door  --  peers , pounds . Claire ! Are you there ? Did n't you hear the revolver ? Has she gone down cellar ? Tries the trap door . Bolted ! Well I love the way she keeps people locked out ! DEMMING And in . HARRY ARCHER Getting angry , shouting at the trap door . Did n't you hear the revolver ? Going to Tom . Awfully sorry , old man , but  --  In astonishment to Dick . He ca n't hear me . Tom , knocking with the revolver to get their attention makes a gesture of inquiry with it . No  --  no  --  no ! Is he asking if he shall shoot himself ? Shaking his head violently . Oh , no  --  no ! Um  --  um ! p. 27 DEMMING Hardly seems a man would shoot himself because he ca n't get to his breakfast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ! Tom is making another inquiry with the revolver . No ! not here . Do n't shoot yourself . Trying hard to get the word through . Shoot yourself . I mean  --  do n't . Petulantly to Dick . It 's ridiculous that you ca n't make a man understand you when he looks right at you like that . Turning back to Tom . Read my lips . Lips . I 'm saying  --  Oh damn . Where is Claire ? All right  --  I 'll explain it with motions . We wanted the salt . . . . Going over it to himself. and Claire would n't let us go out for it on account of the temperature . Salt . Temperature . Takes his egg-cup to the door , violent motion of shaking in salt . But  --  no  --  Shakes his head . No salt . He then takes the thermometer , a flower pot , holds them up to Tom . On account of the temperature . Tem-per-a  --  Tom is not getting it . Oh  --  well , what can you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be preparing the revolver for action . Harry pounds on the inner door . Claire ! Do you want Tom to shoot himself ? As he looks in there , the trap door lifts , and Claire comes half-way up. p. 28 CLAIRE ARCHER Why , what is Tom doing out there , with a revolver ? HARRY ARCHER He is about to shoot himself because you 've locked him out from his breakfast . CLAIRE ARCHER He must know more interesting ways of destroying himself . Bowing to Tom . Good morning . From his side of the glass Tom bows and smiles back . Is n't it strange  --  our being in here  --  and he being out there ? HARRY ARCHER Claire , have you no ideas of hospitality ? Let him in ! CLAIRE ARCHER In ? Perhaps that is n't hospitality . HARRY ARCHER Well , whatever hospitality is , what is out there is snow  --  and wind  --  and our guest  --  who was asked to come here for his breakfast . To think a man has to say such things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though I like his looks out there . She takes the key from her pocket . HARRY ARCHER Thank heaven the door 's coming open . Somebody can go for salt , and we can have our eggs . CLAIRE ARCHER And open the door again  --  to let the salt in ? No . If you insist on salt tell Tom now to go back and get it . It 's a stormy morning and there 'll be just one opening of the door . p. 29 HARRY ARCHER How can we tell him what we ca n't make him hear ? And why does he think we 're holding this conversation instead of letting him in ? CLAIRE ARCHER It would be interesting to know . I wonder if he 'll tell us ? HARRY ARCHER Claire ! Is this any time to wonder anything ? CLAIRE ARCHER Give up the idea of salt for your egg and I 'll let him in . Holds up the key to Tom to indicate that for her part she is quite ready to let him in . HARRY ARCHER I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salt . It 's quite simple . Harry goes through another pantomime with the egg cup and the missing shaker . Claire , still standing half way down cellar , sneezes . Harry growing all the while less amiable , explains with thermometer and flower pot that there can only be one opening of the door . Tom looks interested , but unenlightened . But suddenly he smiles , nods , vanishes . HARRY ARCHER Well , thank heaven Exhausted that 's over . CLAIRE ARCHER Sitting on the top step . It was all so queer . He locked out on his side of the door . You locked in on yours . Looking right at each other and  --  p. 30 HARRY ARCHER In mockery . And me trying to tell him to kindly fetch the salt ! CLAIRE ARCHER Yes . HARRY ARCHER To Dick . Well , I did n't do so bad a job , did I ? Quite an idea , explaining our situation with the thermometer and the flower pot . That was really an apology for keeping him out there . Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching and sees Tom coming . Now there he is , Claire . And probably pretty well fed up on weather . Claire goes to the door , stops before it . She and Tom look at each other through the glass . Then she lets him in . EDGEWORTHY And now I am in . For a time it seemed I was not to be in . But after I got the idea , that you were keeping me out there to see if I could get the idea  --  it would be too humiliating for a wall of glass to keep one from understanding . Taking it from his pocket . So there 's the other thermometer . Where do you want it ? Claire takes it . CLAIRE ARCHER And where 's the pepper ? EDGEWORTHY Putting it on the table . And here 's the pepper . p. 31 HARRY ARCHER Pepper ? EDGEWORTHY When Claire sneezed I knew  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , I knew if I sneezed you would bring the pepper . EDGEWORTHY Funny , how one always remembers the salt , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg without pepper ? HARRY ARCHER Nastily . There 's your egg , Edgeworthy . Pointing to it on the floor . Claire decided it would be a good idea to smash everything , so she began with your egg . EDGEWORTHY Looking at his egg . The idea of smashing everything is really more intriguing than an egg . HARRY ARCHER Nice that you feel that way about it . CLAIRE ARCHER Giving Tom his coffee . You want to hear something amusing ? I married Harry because I thought he would smash something . HARRY ARCHER Well , that was an error in judgment . CLAIRE ARCHER I 'm such a naive trusting person  --  Harry laughs  --  Claire gives him a surprised look , continues simply . Such a guileless soul that I thought flying would do something to a man . But it did n't take us out . We just took it in. p. 32 EDGEWORTHY It 's only our own spirit can take us out . HARRY ARCHER Whatever you mean by out . CLAIRE ARCHER After looking intently at Tom , and considering it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose . Mine is n't . It has something to do with what I do . To fly . To be free in air . To look from above on the world of all my days . Be where man has never been ! Yes  --  would n't you think the spirit could get the idea ? The earth grows smaller . I am leaving . What are they  --  running around down there ? Why do they run around down there ? Houses ? Houses are funny lines and down-going slants  --  houses are vanishing slants . I am alone . Can I breathe this rarer air ? Shall I go higher ? Shall I go too high ? I am loose . I am out . But no ; man flew , and returned to earth the man who left it . HARRY ARCHER And jolly well likely not to have returned at all if he 'd had those flighty notions while operating a machine . CLAIRE ARCHER Oh , Harry ! Not lightly asked . Ca n't you see it would be better not to have returned than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have some regard for human life . p. 33 CLAIRE ARCHER Why no  --  I am the one who has the regard for human life . More lightly . That was why I swiftly divorced my stick-in-the-mud artist and married  --  the man of flight . But I merely passed from a stick-in-the-mud artist to a  --  DEMMING Stick-in-the-air aviator ? HARRY ARCHER Speaking of your stick-in-the-mud artist , as you romantically call your first blunder , is n't his daughter  --  and yours  --  due here today ? CLAIRE ARCHER I knew something was disturbing me . Elizabeth . A daughter is being delivered unto me this morning . I have a feeling it will be more painful than the original delivery . She has been , as they quaintly say , educated ; prepared for her place in life . HARRY ARCHER And fortunately Claire has a sister who is willing to give her young niece that place . CLAIRE ARCHER The idea of giving anyone a place in life . HARRY ARCHER Yes ! The very idea ! CLAIRE ARCHER Yes ! As often , the mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The war . There was another gorgeous chance . p. 34 HARRY ARCHER Chance for what ? I call you , Claire . I ask you to say what you mean . CLAIRE ARCHER I do n't know  --  precisely . If I did  --  there 'd be no use saying it . At Harry 's impatient exclamation she turns to Tom . EDGEWORTHY Nodding . The only thing left worth saying is the thing we ca n't say . HARRY ARCHER Help ! CLAIRE ARCHER Yes . But the war did n't help . Oh , it was a stunning chance ! But fast as we could  --  scuttled right back to the trim little thing we 'd been shocked out of . HARRY ARCHER You bet we did  --  showing our good sense . CLAIRE ARCHER Showing our incapacity  --  for madness . HARRY ARCHER Oh , come now Claire  --  snap out of it . You 're not really trying to say that capacity for madness is a good thing to have ? CLAIRE ARCHER In simple surprise . Why yes , of course . DEMMING But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a gleam of hope . p. 35 CLAIRE ARCHER Not the madness that  --  breaks through . And it was  --  a stunning chance ! Mankind massed to kill . We have failed . We are through . We will destroy . Break this up  --  it ca n't go farther . In the air above  --  in the sea below  --  it is to kill ! All we had thought we were  --  we are n't . We were shut in with what was n't so . Is there one ounce of energy has not gone to this killing ? Is there one love not torn in two ? Throw it in ! Now ? Ready ? Break up . Push . Harder . Break up . And then  --  and then  --  ! But we did n't say  --  " And then  --  " The spirit did n't take the tip . HARRY ARCHER Claire ! Come now  --  Looking to the others for help . Let 's talk of something else . CLAIRE ARCHER Plants do it . The big leap  --  it 's called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've gone as far as they can go . Something in them knows they 're shut in to just that . So  --  go mad  --  that life may not be prisoned . Break themselves up  --  into crazy things  --  into lesser things , and from the pieces  --  may come one silver of life with vitality to find the future . How beautiful . How brave . EDGEWORTHY As if he would call her from too far  --  or would let her know he has gone with her . Claire ! p. 36 CLAIRE ARCHER Her eyes turning to him . Why should we mind lying under the earth ? We who have no such initiative  --  no proud madness ? Why think it death to lie under life so flexible  --  so ruthless and ever-renewing ? ANTHONY From the door of the inner room . Miss Claire ? CLAIRE ARCHER After an instant . Yes ? She goes with him , as they disappear his voice heard , " show me now . . . want those violets bedded . " HARRY ARCHER Oh , this has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop to it some way . Why Claire used to be the best sport a man ever played around with . I ca n't stand it to see her getting hysterical . EDGEWORTHY That was not hysterical . HARRY ARCHER What was it then  --  I want to know ? EDGEWORTHY It was  --  a look . HARRY ARCHER Oh , I might have known I 'd get no help from either of you . Even you , Edgeworthy  --  much as she thinks of you  --  and fine sort as I 've no doubt you are , you 're doing Claire no good  --  encouraging her in these queer ways . p. 37 EDGEWORTHY I could n't change Claire if I would . HARRY ARCHER And would n't if you could . EDGEWORTHY No . But you do n't have to worry about me . I 'm going away in a day or two . And I shall not be back . HARRY ARCHER Trouble with you is , it makes a little difference whether you 're here or away . Just the fact of your existence does encourage Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a smile . But you would n't ask me to go so far as to stop my existence ? Though I would do that for Claire  --  if it were the way to help her . HARRY ARCHER By Jove , you say that as if you meant it . EDGEWORTHY Do you think I would say anything about Claire . I did n't mean ? HARRY ARCHER You think a lot of her , do n't you ? Tom nods . You do n't mean  --  A laugh letting him say it. that you 're  --  in love with Claire ? EDGEWORTHY In love ? Oh , that 's much too easy . Certainly I do love Claire . HARRY ARCHER Well , you 're a cool one ! p. 38 EDGEWORTHY Let her be herself . Ca n't you see she 's troubled ? HARRY ARCHER Well , what is there to trouble Claire ? Now I ask you . It seems to me she has everything . EDGEWORTHY She 's left so  --  open . Too exposed . As Harry moves impatiently . Please do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying it . You see Claire is n't hardened into one of those forms she talks about . She 's too  --  aware . Always pulled toward what could be  --  tormented by the lost adventure . HARRY ARCHER Well , there 's danger in all that . Of course there 's danger , Tom . But you ca n't help that . HARRY ARCHER Claire was the best fun a woman could be . Is yet  --  at times . EDGEWORTHY Let her be  --  at times . As much as she can and will . She does need that . Do n't keep her from it by making her feel you 're holding her in it . Above all , do n't try to stop what she 's doing here . If she can do it with plants , perhaps she wo n't have to do it with herself . HARRY ARCHER Do what ? EDGEWORTHY Low , after a pause . Break up what exists . Open the door to destruction in the hope of  --  a door on the far side of destruction . p. 39 HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in irritation , troubled . To Anthony , who is passing through with a sprayer . Anthony , have any arrangements been made about Miss Claire 's daughter ? ANTHONY I have n't heard of any arrangements . HARRY ARCHER Well , she 'll have to have some heat in her room . We ca n't all live out here . ANTHONY Indeed you can not . It is not good for the plants . HARRY ARCHER I 'm going where I can smoke . Goes out . DEMMING Lightly , but fascinated by the idea . You think there is a door on the  --  hinter side of destruction ? EDGEWORTHY How can one tell  --  where a door may be . One thing I want to say to you  --  for it is about you . Regards Dick and not with his usual impersonal contemplation . I do n't think Claire should have  --  any door closed to her . Pause . You know , I think , what I mean . And perhaps you can guess how it hurts to say it . Whether it 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the wild hope of that door through , it 's  --  Suddenly all human . Be good to her ! After a difficult moment , smiles . Going away forever is like dying , so one can say things . p. 40 DEMMING Why do you do it  --  go away forever ? EDGEWORTHY I have n't succeeded here . DEMMING But you 've tried the going away before . EDGEWORTHY Never knowing I would not come back . So that was n't going away . My hope is that this will be like looking at life from outside life . DEMMING But then you 'll not be in it . EDGEWORTHY I have n't been able to look at it while in it . DEMMING Is n't it more important to be in it than to look at it ? EDGEWORTHY Not what I mean by look . DEMMING It 's hard for me to conceive of  --  loving Claire and going away from her forever . EDGEWORTHY Perhaps it 's harder to do than to conceive of . DEMMING Then why do it ? EDGEWORTHY It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm like Harry now . I do n't get you . EDGEWORTHY I suppose not . Your way is different . With calm , with sadness  --  not with malice . But I shall have her longer . And from deeper . p. 41 DEMMING I know that . EDGEWORTHY Though I miss much . Much . The buzzer . Tom looks around to see if anyone is coming to answer it , then goes to the phone . Yes ? . . . I 'll see if I can get to her . To Dick . Claire 's daughter has arrived . Looking in the inner room  --  returns to phone . I do n't see her . Catching a glimpse of Anthony off right . Oh , Anthony , where 's Miss Claire ? Her daughter has arrived . ANTHONY She 's working at something very important in her experiments . DEMMING But is n't her daughter one of her experiments ? ANTHONY After a baffled moment . Her daughter is finished . EDGEWORTHY At the phone . Sorry  --  but I ca n't get to Claire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap door . I did speak to Anthony , but he says that Claire is working at one of her experiments and that her daughter is finished . I do n't know how to make her hear .  --  I took the revolver back to the house . Anyway you will remember Claire does n't answer the revolver . I hate to reach Claire when she does n't want to be reached . Why of course  --  a daughter is very important , but oh , that 's too bad . Putting down the receiver . He says the girl 's feelings are hurt . Is n't that annoying ? Gingerly pounds on the trap door . Then with the other hand . Waits , Anthony has a gentle smile for the gentle tapping  --  nods approval as Tom returns to the phone . She does n't come up . Indeed I did  --  with both fists  --  Sorry . p. 42 ANTHONY Please , you wo n't try again to disturb Miss Claire , will you ? DEMMING Her daughter is here , Anthony . She has n't seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got along without a mother for a year  --  Goes back to his work . DEMMING Smiling after Anthony . Plants are queer . Perhaps it 's safer to do it with pencil  --  Regards Tom . Or with pure thought . Things that grow in the earth  --  EDGEWORTHY Nodding . I suppose because we grew in the earth . DEMMING I 'm always shocked to find myself in agreement with Harry , but I too am worried about Claire  --  and this . Looking at the plants . EDGEWORTHY It 's her best chance . DEMMING Do n't you hate to go away to India  --  forever  --  leaving Claire 's future uncertain ? EDGEWORTHY You 're cruel now . And you knew that you were being cruel . DEMMING Yes , I like the lines of your face when you suffer . p. 43 EDGEWORTHY The lines of yours when you 're causing suffering  --  I do n't like them . DEMMING Perhaps that 's your limitation . EDGEWORTHY I grant you it may be . They are silent . I had an odd feeling then that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that we were plants . And you were a beautiful plant , and I  --  I was a very ugly plant . I confess it surprised me  --  finding myself so ugly a plant . A young girl is seen outside . Harry gets the door open for her and brings Elizabeth in . HARRY ARCHER There 's heat here . And two of your mother 's friends . Mr. Demming  --  Richard Demming  --  the artist  --  and I think you and Mr. Edgeworthy are old friends . Elizabeth comes forward . She is the creditable young American  --  well built , poised , " cultivated , " so sound an expression of the usual as to be able to meet the world with assurance  --  assurance which training has made rather graceful . She is about seventeen  --  and mature . You feel solid things behind her . EDGEWORTHY I knew you when you were a baby . You used to kick a great deal then . p. 44 ELIZABETH Laughing , with ease . And scream , I have n't a doubt . But I 've stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was you who gave me the idol . EDGEWORTHY Proselyting , I 'm afraid . ELIZABETH I beg  --  ? Oh  --  yes . Laughing cordially . I see . she does n't . I dressed the idol up in my dolls ' clothes . They fitted perfectly  --  the idol was just the size of my doll Ailine . But mother did n't like the idol that way , and tore the clothes getting them off . To Harry , after looking around . Is mother here ? HARRY ARCHER Crossly . Yes , she 's here . Of course she 's here . And she must know you 're here . After looking in the inner room he goes to the trap door and makes a great noise . ELIZABETH Oh  --  please . Really  --  it does n't make the least difference . HARRY ARCHER Well , all I can say is , your manners are better than your mother 's . ELIZABETH But you see I do n't do anything interesting , so I have to have good manners . Lightly , but leaving the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turning cordially to Dick . My father was an artist . p. 45 DEMMING Yes , I know . ELIZABETH He was a portrait painter . Do you do portraits ? DEMMING Well , not the kind people buy . ELIZABETH They bought father 's . DEMMING Yes , I know he did that kind . HARRY ARCHER Still irritated . Why , you do n't do portraits . DEMMING I did one of you the other day . You thought it was a milk-can . ELIZABETH Laughing delightedly . No ? Not really ? Did you think  --  How could you think  --  As Harry does not join the laugh . Oh , I beg your pardon . I  --  Does mother grow beautiful roses now ? HARRY ARCHER No , she does not . The trap door begins to move . Claire 's head appears . ELIZABETH Mother ! It 's been so long  --  She tries to overcome the difficulties and embrace her mother . CLAIRE ARCHER Protecting a box she has . Careful , Elizabeth . We must n't upset the lice . p. 46 ELIZABETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh  --  yes . You take it  --  them  --  off plants , do n't you ? CLAIRE ARCHER I 'm putting them on certain plants . ELIZABETH Weakly . Oh , I thought you took them off . CLAIRE ARCHER Calling . Anthony ! He comes . The lice . He takes them from her . Claire , who has not fully ascended , looks at Elizabeth , hesitates , then suddenly starts back down the stairs . HARRY ARCHER Outraged . Claire ! Slowly she re-ascends  --  sits on the top step . After a long pause in which he has waited for Claire to open a conversation with her daughter . Well , and what have you been doing at school all this time ? ELIZABETH Oh  --  studying . CLAIRE ARCHER Studying what ? ELIZABETH Why  --  the things one studies , mother . p. 47 CLAIRE ARCHER Oh ! The things one studies . Looks down cellar again . DEMMING After another wait . And what have you been doing besides studying ? ELIZABETH Oh  --  the things one does . Tennis and skating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELIZABETH Yes . All the things . The  --  the things one does . Though I have n't been in school these last few months , you know . Miss Lane took us to Europe . EDGEWORTHY And how did you like Europe ? ELIZABETH Capably . Oh , I thought it was awfully amusing . All the girls were quite mad about Europe . Of course , I 'm glad I 'm an American . CLAIRE ARCHER Why ? ELIZABETH Laughing . Why  --  mother ! Of course one is glad one is an American . All the girls  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Turning away . O  --  h ! A moan under the breath . p. 48 ELIZABETH Why , mother  --  are n't you well ? HARRY ARCHER Your mother has been working pretty hard at all this . ELIZABETH Oh , I do so want to know all about it ? Perhaps I can help you ! I think it 's just awfully amusing that you 're doing something . One does now-a-days , does n't one ?  --  if you know what I mean . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do something . DEMMING Slyly . And you thought , Claire , that the war was lost . ELIZABETH The war ? Lost ! Her capable laugh . Fancy our losing a war ! Miss Lane says we should give thanks . She says we should each do some expressive thing  --  you know what I mean ? And that this is the keynote of the age . Of course , one 's own kind of thing . Like mother  --  growing flowers . CLAIRE ARCHER You think that is one 's own kind of thing ? ELIZABETH Why of course I do , mother . And so does Miss Lane . All the girls  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Shaking her head as if to get something out . S  --  hoo . p. 49 ELIZABETH What is it , mother ? CLAIRE ARCHER A fly shut up in my ear  --  " All the girls ! " ELIZABETH Laughing . Mother was always so amusing . So different  --  if you know what I mean . Vacations I 've lived mostly with Aunt Adelaide , you know . CLAIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY ARCHER Well , somebody has to do it . ELIZABETH And I do love Aunt Adelaide , but I think it 's going to be awfully amusing to be around with mother now  --  and help her with her work . Help do some useful beautiful thing . CLAIRE ARCHER I am not doing any useful beautiful thing . ELIZABETH Oh , but you are , mother . Of course you are . Miss Lane says so . She says it is your splendid heritage gives you this impulse to do a beautiful thing for the race . She says you are doing in your way what the great teachers and preachers behind you did in theirs . CLAIRE ARCHER Who is good for little more . Well all I can say is , Miss Lane is stung . ELIZABETH Mother ! What a thing to say of Miss Lane . From this slipping into more of a little girl manner . Oh , she gave me a speil one day about living up to the men I come from . Claire turns and regards her daughter . p. 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I do n't know . Quite a job , I 'll say . Of course , I 'd have to do it in my way . I 'm not going to teach or preach or be a stuffy person . But now that  --  She here becomes the product of a superior school. values have shifted and such sensitive new things have been liberated in the world  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Low . Do n't use those words . ELIZABETH Why  --  why not ? CLAIRE ARCHER Because you do n't know what they mean . ELIZABETH Why of course I know what they mean ! CLAIRE ARCHER Turning away . You 're  --  stepping on the plants . HARRY ARCHER Hastily . Your mother has been working awfully hard at all this . ELIZABETH Well , now that I 'm here you 'll let me help you , wo n't you , mother ? CLAIRE ARCHER Trying for control . You need n't  --  bother . p. 51 ELIZABETH But I want to . Help add to the wealth of the world . CLAIRE ARCHER Will you please get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealth of the world ! ELIZABETH But , mother  --  of course you are . To produce a new and better kind of plants  --  CLAIRE ARCHER They may be new . I do n't give a damn whether they 're better . ELIZABETH But  --  but what are they then ? CLAIRE ARCHER As if choked out of her . They 're different . ELIZABETH Thinks a minute , then laughs triumphantly . But what 's the use of making them different if they are n't better ? HARRY ARCHER A good square question , Claire . Why do n't you answer it ? CLAIRE ARCHER I do n't have to answer it . HARRY ARCHER Why not give the girl a fair show ? You never have , you know . Since she 's interested , why not tell her what it is you 're doing ? CLAIRE ARCHER She is not interested . ELIZABETH But I am , mother . Indeed I am . I do want awfully to understand what you are doing , and help you . p. 52 CLAIRE ARCHER You ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try ? CLAIRE ARCHER Why do you ask me to do that ? This is my own thing . Why do you make me feel I should  --  Goes to Elizabeth . I will be good to you , Elizabeth . We 'll go around together . I have n't done it , but  --  you 'll see . We 'll do gay things . I 'll have a lot of beaus around for you . Anything else . Not  --  this is  --  Not this . ELIZABETH As you like , mother , of course . I just would have been so glad to  --  to share the thing that interests you . Hurt borne with good-breeding and a smile . HARRY ARCHER Claire ! Which says , " How can you ? " CLAIRE ARCHER Who is looking at Elizabeth . Yes , I will try . EDGEWORTHY I do n't think so . As Claire says  --  anything else . ELIZABETH Why of course  --  I do n't at all want to intrude . HARRY ARCHER It 'll do Claire good to take someone in . To get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving at . p. 53 CLAIRE ARCHER Oh  --  Harry . But yes  --  I will try . Does try , but no words come . Laughs . When you come to say it it 's not  --  One would rather not nail it to a cross of words  --  Laughs again. with brass tacks . HARRY ARCHER Affectionately . But I want to see you put things into words , Claire , and realize just where you are . CLAIRE ARCHER Oddly . You think that 's a  --  good idea ? ELIZABETH In her manner of holding the world capably in her hands . Now let 's talk of something else . I had n't the least idea of making mother feel badly . CLAIRE ARCHER Desperately . No , we 'll go on . Though I do n't know  --  where we 'll end . I ca n't answer for that . These plants  --  Beginning flounderingly. perhaps they are less beautiful  --  less sound  --  than the plants from which they diverged . But they have found  --  otherness . Laughs a little shrilly . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  stop this ! To Harry . This is wrong . CLAIRE ARCHER Excitedly . No ; I 'm going on . They have been shocked out of what they were  --  into something they were not ; they 've broken from the forms in which they found themselves . They are alien . Outside . That 's it , outside ; if you  --  know what I mean ? ELIZABETH Not shocked from what she is . But of course , the object of it all is to make them better plants . Otherwise , what would be the sense in doing it ? CLAIRE ARCHER Not reached by Elizabeth . Out there  --  Giving it with her hands. lies all that 's not been touched  --  lies life that waits . Back here  --  the old pattern , done again , again and again . So long done it does n't even know itself for a pattern  --  in immensity . But this  --  has invaded . Crept a little way into  --  what was n't . Strange lines in life unused . And when you make a pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then you know that anything may be  --  if only you know how to reach it . This has taken form , not easily , but with great struggle between feeling and words . p. 55 HARRY ARCHER Cordially . Now I begin to get you , Claire . I never knew before why you called it the Edge Vine . CLAIRE ARCHER I should destroy the Edge Vine . It is n't  --  over the edge . It 's running back to  --  " all the girls . " It 's a little afraid of Miss Lane . Looking somberly at it . You are out , but you are not alive . ELIZABETH Why it looks all right , mother . CLAIRE ARCHER Did n't carry life with it from the life it left . Dick  --  you know what I mean . At least you ought to . Her ruthless way of not letting anyone 's feelings stand in the way of truth . Then destroy it for me ! It 's hard to do it  --  with the hands that made it . DEMMING But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHER Impatiently . I 've told you . It can not create . DEMMING But you say you can go on producing it , and it 's interesting in form . CLAIRE ARCHER And you think I 'll stop with that ? Be shut in  --  with different life  --  that ca n't creep on ? After trying to put destroying hands upon it . It 's hard to  --  get past what we 've done . Our own dead things  --  block the way . p. 56 EDGEWORTHY But you 're doing it this next time , Claire . Nodding to the inner room . In there ! CLAIRE ARCHER Turning to that room . I 'm not sure . EDGEWORTHY But you told me Breath of Life has already reproduced itself . Does n't that show it has brought life from the life it left ? CLAIRE ARCHER But timidly , rather  --  wistfully . A little homesick . If it is less sure this time , then it is going back to  --  Miss Lane . But if the pattern 's clearer now , then it has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELIZABETH You know , something tells me this is wrong . CLAIRE ARCHER The hymn-singing ancestors are tuning up . ELIZABETH I do n't know what you mean by that mother , but  --  CLAIRE ARCHER But we will now sing , " Nearer my God to Thee ; Nearer to  --  " ELIZABETH Laughingly breaking in . Well , I do n't care . Of course you can make fun of me , but something does tell me this is wrong . To do what  --  what  --  p. 57 DEMMING What God did ? ELIZABETH Well  --  yes . Unless you do it to make them better  --  to do it just to do it  --  that does n't seem right to me . CLAIRE ARCHER Roughly . " Right to you ! " And that 's all you know of adventure  --  and of anguish . Do you know it is you  --  world of which you 're so true a flower  --  makes me have to leave ? You 're there to hold the door shut ! Because you 're young and of a gayer world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? Do you know why you 're so sure of yourself ? Because you ca n't feel . Ca n't feel  --  the limitless  --  out there  --  a sea just over the hill . I will not stay with you ! Buries her hands in the earth around the Edge Vine . But suddenly steps back from it as she had from Elizabeth . And I will not stay with you ! Grasps it as we grasp what we would kill , is trying to pull it up . They all step forward in horror . Anthony is drawn in by this harm to the plant . ANTHONY Miss Claire ! Miss Claire ! The work of years ! CLAIRE ARCHER May only make a prison ! Struggling with Harry , who is trying to stop her . You think I too will die on the edge ? She has thrown him away , is now struggling with the vine . Why did I make you ? To get past you ! As she twists it . Oh yes , I know you have thorns ! The Edge Vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep roots , she has it up . As she holds the torn roots . Oh , I have loved you so ! You took me where I had n't been . p. 58 ELIZABETH Who has been looking on with a certain practical horror . Well , I 'd say it would be better not to go there ! CLAIRE ARCHER Now I know what you are for ! Flings her arm back to strike Elizabeth with the Edge Vine . HARRY ARCHER Wresting it from her . Claire ! Are you mad ? CLAIRE ARCHER No , I 'm not mad . I 'm  --  too sane ! Pointing to Elizabeth  --  and the words come from mighty roots . To think that object ever moved my belly and sucked my breast ! Elizabeth hides her face as if struck . HARRY ARCHER Going to Elizabeth , turning to Claire . This is atrocious ! You 're cruel . He leads Elizabeth to the door and out . After an irresolute moment in which he looks from Claire to Tom , Dick follows . Anthony can not bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . Claire 's gesture stops him . He goes into the inner room . CLAIRE ARCHER Kicking the Edge Vine out of her way , drawing deep breath , smiling . O  --  h . How good I feel ! Light ! A movement as if she could fly . Read me something , Tom dear . Or say something pleasant  --  about God . But be very careful what you say about him ! I have a feeling  --  he 's not far off . Curtain @x Late afternoon of the following day . Claire is alone in the tower  --  a tower which is thought to be round but does not complete the circle . The back is curved , then jagged lines break from that , and the front is a queer bulging window  --  in a curve that leans . The whole structure is as if given a twist by some terrific force  --  like something wrung . It is lighted by an old-fashioned watchman 's lantern hanging from the ceiling ; the innumerable pricks and slits in the metal throw a marvelous pattern on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . There are no windows at back , and there is no door save an opening in the floor . The delicately distorted rail of a spiral staircase winds up from below . Claire is seen through the huge ominous window as if shut into the tower . She is lying on a seat at the back looking at a book of drawings . To do this she has left the door of her lantern a little open  --  and her own face is drawing clearly seen . A door is heard opening below ; laughing voices , Claire listens , not pleased . ADELAIDE Voice coming up . Dear  --  dear , why do they make such twisting steps . HARRY ARCHER Take your time , most up now . Harry 's head appears , he looks back . Making it all right ? p. 61 ADELAIDE I ca n't tell yet  --  Laughingly . No , I do n't think so . HARRY ARCHER Reaching back a hand for her . The last lap  --  is the bad lap . Adelaide is up , and occupied with getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , Claire , we thought we 'd come up . ADELAIDE As Claire does not greet her . I 'm sorry to intrude , but I have to see you , Claire . There are things to be  --  arranged . Claire volunteering nothing about arrangements , Adelaide surveys the tower . An unsympathetic eye goes from the curves to the lines which diverge . Then she looks from the window . Well , at least you have a view . HARRY ARCHER This the first time you 've been up here ? ADELAIDE Yes , in the five years you 've had the house I was never asked up here before . CLAIRE ARCHER Amiably enough . You were n't asked up here now . ADELAIDE Harry asked me. p. 62 CLAIRE ARCHER It is n't Harry 's tower . But never mind  --  since you do n't like it  --  it 's all right . ADELAIDE Her eyes again rebuking the irregularities of the tower . No , I confess I do not care for it . A round tower should go on being round HARRY ARCHER Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of it . Going over and sitting by her , his hand on her ankle . Did n't you , old girl ? She says she 'd like to have known the architect . ADELAIDE Probably a tiresome person too incompetent to make a perfect tower . CLAIRE ARCHER Well , now he 's disposed of , what next ? ADELAIDE Sitting down in a manner of capably opening a conference . Next , Elizabeth , and you , Claire . Just what is the matter with Elizabeth ? CLAIRE ARCHER Whose voice is cool , even , as if herself is not really engaged by this . Nothing is the matter with her . She is a tower that is a tower . ADELAIDE Well , is that anything against her ? p. 63 CLAIRE ARCHER She 's just like one of her father 's portraits . They never interested me . Nor does she . Looks at the drawings which do interest her . ADELAIDE A mother can not cast off her own child simply because she does not interest her ! CLAIRE ARCHER An instant raising cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it would be monstrous ! CLAIRE ARCHER And why ca n't she be monstrous  --  if she has to be ? ADELAIDE You do n't have to be . That 's where I 'm out of patience with you , Claire . You are really a particularly intelligent , competent person , and it 's time for you to call a halt to this nonsense and be the woman you were meant to be ! CLAIRE ARCHER Holding the book up to see another way . What inside dope have you on what I was meant to be ? ADELAIDE I know what you came from . CLAIRE ARCHER Well , is n't it about time somebody got loose from that ? What I came from made you , so  --  ADELAIDE Stiffly . I see . p. 64 CLAIRE ARCHER So  --  you being such a tower of strength , why need I too be imprisoned in what I came from ? ADELAIDE It is n't being imprisoned . Right there is where you make your mistake , Claire . Who 's in a tower  --  in an unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  free , busy , happy . Among people . I have no time to think of myself . CLAIRE ARCHER No . ADELAIDE No . My family . The things that interest them ; from morning till night it 's  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , I know you have a large family , Adelaide ; five , and Elizabeth makes six . ADELAIDE We 'll speak of Elizabeth later . But if you would just get out of yourself and enter into other people 's lives  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Then I would become just like you . And we should all be just alike in order to assure one another that we 're all just right . But since you and Harry and Elizabeth and ten million other people bolster each other up , why do you especially need me ? ADELAIDE Not unkindly . We do n't need you as much as you need us . CLAIRE ARCHER A wry face . I never liked what I needed . p. 65 HARRY ARCHER I am convinced I am the worst thing in the world for you , Claire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking her head . I 'm afraid you 're not . I do n't know  --  perhaps you are . ADELAIDE Well , what is it you want , Claire ? CLAIRE ARCHER Simply . You would n't know if I told you . ADELAIDE That 's rather arrogant . HARRY ARCHER Yes , take a chance , Claire . I have been known to get an idea  --  and Adelaide quite frequently gets one . CLAIRE ARCHER The first resentment she has shown . You two feel very superior , do n't you ? ADELAIDE I do n't think we are the ones who are feeling superior . CLAIRE ARCHER Oh , yes , you are . Very superior to what you think is my feeling of superiority , comparing my  --  isolation with your " heart of humanity . " Soon we will speak of the beauty of common experiences , of the  --  Oh , I could say it all before we come to it . HARRY ARCHER Adelaide came up here to help you , Claire . p. 66 CLAIRE ARCHER Adelaide came up here to lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ADELAIDE Gently . But ca n't you see that one may do that to one 's self ? CLAIRE ARCHER Thinks of this , looks suddenly tired  --  then smiles . Well , at least I 've changed the keys . HARRY ARCHER " Locked in . " Bunkum . Get that out of your head . Claire . Who 's locked in ? Nobody that I know of , We 're all free Americans . Free as air . ADELAIDE I wish you 'd come and hear one of Dr. Morley 's sermons , Claire . You 're very old-fashioned if you think sermons are what they used to be . CLAIRE ARCHER With interest . And do they still sing " Nearer my God to Thee ? " ADELAIDE They do , and a noble old hymn it is . It would do you no harm at all to sing it . CLAIRE ARCHER Eagerly . Sing it to me , Adelaide . I 'd like to hear you sing it . ADELAIDE It would be sacrilege to sing it to you in this mood . CLAIRE ARCHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not so sure God would agree with you . That would be one on you , would n't it ? p. 67 ADELAIDE It 's easy to feel one 's self set apart ! CLAIRE ARCHER No , it is n't . ADELAIDE Beginning anew . It 's a new age , Claire . Spiritual values  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Spiritual values ! In her brooding way . So you have pulled that up . With cunning . Do n't think I do n't know what it is you do . ADELAIDE Well , what do I do ? I 'm sure I have no idea what you 're talking about . HARRY ARCHER Affectionately , as Claire is looking with intentness at what he does not see . What does she do , Claire ? CLAIRE ARCHER It 's rather clever , what she does . Snatching the phrase  --  A movement as if pulling something up. standing it up between her and  --  the life that 's there . And by saying it enough .  --  " We have life ! We have life ! We have life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be  --  " Just so ! We are that . Right this way , please  --  " That , I suppose , is what we mean by needing each other . All join in the chorus , " This is it ! This is it ! This is it ! " And anyone who wo n't join is to be  --  visited by relatives . Regarding Adelaide with curiosity . Do you really think that anything is going on in you ? p. 68 ADELAIDE Stiffly . I am not one to hold myself up as a perfect example of what the human race may be . CLAIRE ARCHER Brightly . Well , that 's good . HARRY ARCHER Claire ! CLAIRE ARCHER Humility 's a real thing  --  not just a fine name for laziness . HARRY ARCHER Well Lord A'mighty , you ca n't call Adelaide lazy . CLAIRE ARCHER She stays in one place because she has n't the energy to go anywhere else . ADELAIDE As if the last word in absurdity has been said . I have n't energy ? CLAIRE ARCHER Mildly . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you keep so busy . ADELAIDE Well  --  Claire 's nerves are in a worse state than I had realized . CLAIRE ARCHER So perhaps we 'd better look at Blake 's drawings . Takes up the book . ADELAIDE It would be all right for me to look at Blake 's drawings . You 'd better look at the Sistine Madonna . Affectionately , after she has watched Claire 's face a moment . What is it , Claire ? Why do you shut yourself out from us ? p. 69 CLAIRE ARCHER I told you . Because I do not want to be shut in with you . ADELAIDE All of this is not very pleasant for Harry . HARRY ARCHER I want Claire to be gay . CLAIRE ARCHER Funny  --  you should want that . Speaks unwillingly , a curious , wistful unwillingness . Did you ever say a preposterous thing , then go trailing after the thing you 've said and find it was n't so preposterous ? Here is the circle we are in . Describes a big circle . Being gay . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later  --  gayety all gone , and you looking through that little hole the gayety left . ADELAIDE Going to her , as she is still looking through that little hole . Claire , dear , I wish I could make you feel how much I care for you . Simply , with real feeling . You can call me all the names you like  --  dull , common-place , lazy  --  that is a new idea , I confess , but the rest of our family 's gone now , and the love that used to be there between us all  --  the only place for it now is between you and me . You were so much loved , Claire . You ought n't to try and get away from a world in which you are so much loved . To Harry . Mother ,  --  Father  --  all of us , always loved Claire best . We always loved Claire 's queer gayety . Now you 've got to hand it to us for that , as the children say . p. 70 CLAIRE ARCHER Moved , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of you  --  once  --  looked with me through the little pricks the gayety made  --  never one of you  --  once , looked with me at the queer light that came in through the pricks . ADELAIDE And ca n't you see , dear , that it 's better for us we did n't ? And that it would be better for you now if you would just resolutely look somewhere else ? You must see yourself that you have n't the poise of people who are held  --  well , within the circle , if you choose to put it that way . There 's something about being in that main body , having one 's roots in the big common experiences , gives a calm which you have missed . That 's why I want you to take Elizabeth , forget yourself , and CLAIRE ARCHER I do want calm . But mine would have to be a calm I  --  worked my way to . A calm all prepared for me  --  would stink . ADELAIDE Less sympathetically . I know you have to be yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to hurt other people . HARRY ARCHER I think Claire and I had better take a nice long trip . ADELAIDE Now why do n't you ? p. 71 CLAIRE ARCHER I am taking a trip . ADELAIDE Well , Harry is n't , and he 'd like to go and wants you to go with him . Go to Paris and get yourself some awfully good-looking clothes  --  and have one grand fling at the gay world . You really love that , Claire , and you 've been awfully dull lately . I think that 's the whole trouble . HARRY ARCHER I think so too . ADELAIDE This sober business of growing plants  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Not sober  --  it 's mad . ADELAIDE All the more reason for quitting it . CLAIRE ARCHER But madness that is the only chance for sanity . ADELAIDE Come , come , now  --  lets not juggle words . CLAIRE ARCHER Springing up . How dare you say that to me , Adelaide . You who are such a liar and thief and whore with words ! ADELAIDE Facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course not , Claire . You have the most preposterous way of using words . p. 72 CLAIRE ARCHER I respect words . ADELAIDE Well , you 'll please respect me enough not to dare use certain words to me ! CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , I do dare . I 'm tired of what you do  --  you and all of you . Life  --  experience  --  values  --  calm  --  sensitive words which raise their heads as indications . And you pull them up  --  to decorate your stagnant little minds  --  and think that makes you  --  And because you have pulled that word from the life that grew it you wo n't let one who 's honest , and aware , and troubled , try to reach through to  --  to what she does n't know is there . She is moved , excited , as if a cruel thing has been done . Why did you come up here ? ADELAIDE To try and help you . But I begin to fear I ca n't do it . It 's pretty egotistical to claim that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after looking intently at Adelaide , slowly , smiling a little , describes a circle . With deftly used hands makes a quick , vicious break in the circle which is there in the air . HARRY ARCHER Going to her , taking her hands . It 's getting close to dinner time . You were thinking of something else , Claire , when I told you Charlie Emmons was coming to dinner tonight . Answering her look . Sure  --  he is a neurologist , and I want him to see you . I 'm perfectly honest with you  --  cards all on the table , you know that . I 'm hoping if you like him  --  and he 's the best scout in the world , that he can help you . Talking hurriedly against the stillness which follows her look from him to Adelaide , where she sees between them an " understanding " about her . Sure you need help , Claire . Your nerves are a little on the blink  --  from all you 've been doing . No use making a mystery of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and naturally I want you to get a move on yourself and be happy again . p. 73 CLAIRE ARCHER Who has gone over to the window . And this neurologist can make me happy ? HARRY ARCHER Can make you well  --  and then you 'll be happy . ADELAIDE In the voice of now fixing it all up . And I just had an idea about Elizabeth . Instead of working with mere plants , why not think of Elizabeth as a plant and  --  Claire , who has been looking out the window now throws open one of the panes that swings out  --  or seems to and calls down in great excitement . CLAIRE ARCHER Tom ! Tom ! Quick ! Up here ! I 'm in trouble ! HARRY ARCHER Going to the window . That 's a rotten thing to do , Claire ! You 've frightened him . CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , how fast he can run . He was deep in thought and I stabbed right through . HARRY ARCHER Well , he 'll be none too pleased when he gets up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wait for his footsteps , Harry annoyed , Adelaide offended , but stealing worried looks at Claire , who is looking fixedly at the place in the floor where Tom will appear .  --  Running footsteps . p. 74 EDGEWORTHY His voice getting there before he does . Yes , Claire  --  yes  --  yes  --  As his head appears . What is it ? CLAIRE ARCHER At once presenting him and answering his question . My sister . EDGEWORTHY Gasping . Oh ,  --  why  --  is that all ? I mean  --  how do you do ? Pardon , I Panting. came up  --  rather hurriedly . HARRY ARCHER If you want to slap Claire , Tom , I for one have no objection . CLAIRE ARCHER Adelaide has the most interesting idea , Tom . She proposes that I take Elizabeth and roll her in the gutter . Just let her lie there until she breaks up into  --  ADELAIDE Claire ! I do n't see how  --  even in fun  --  pretty vulgar fun  --  you can speak in those terms of a pure young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth . CLAIRE ARCHER Oh , I 've thought that all along . ADELAIDE And I 'm also beginning to suspect that  --  oddity may be just a way of shifting responsibility . p. 75 CLAIRE ARCHER Cordially interested in this possibility . Now you know  --  that might be . ADELAIDE A mother who does not love her own child ! You are an unnatural woman , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER Well , at least it saves me from being a natural one . ADELAIDE Oh  --  I know , you think you have a great deal ! But let me tell you , you 've missed a great deal ! You 've never known the faintest stirring of a mother 's love . CLAIRE ARCHER That 's not true . HARRY ARCHER No . Claire loved our boy . CLAIRE ARCHER I 'm glad he did n't live . HARRY ARCHER Low . Claire ! CLAIRE ARCHER I loved him . Why should I want him to live ? HARRY ARCHER Come , dear , I 'm sorry I spoke of him  --  when you 're not feeling well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 'm seeing something , it does n't mean I 'm sick . HARRY ARCHER Well , let 's go down now . About dinner time . I should n't wonder if Emmons were here . As Adelaide is starting down stairs . Coming , Claire ? p. 76 CLAIRE ARCHER No . HARRY ARCHER But it 's time to go down for dinner . CLAIRE ARCHER I 'm not hungry . HARRY ARCHER But we have a guest . Two guests  --  Adelaide 's staying , too . CLAIRE ARCHER Then you 're not alone . HARRY ARCHER But I invited Dr. Emmons to meet you . CLAIRE ARCHER Her smile flashing . Tell him I am violent tonight . HARRY ARCHER Dearest  --  how can you joke about such things ! CLAIRE ARCHER So you do think they 're serious ? HARRY ARCHER Irritated . No , I do not ! But I want you to come down for dinner ! ADELAIDE Come , come , Claire ; you know quite well this is not the sort of thing one does . CLAIRE ARCHER Why go on saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To Tom . Will you stay with me a while ? I want to purify the tower . Adelaide begins to disappear . p. 77 HARRY ARCHER Fine time to choose for a tte -- tte . As he is leaving . I 'd think more of you , Edgeworthy , if you refused to humor Claire in her ill-breeding . ADELAIDE Her severe voice coming from below . It is not what she was taught . CLAIRE ARCHER No , it 's not what I was taught . Laughing rather timidly . And perhaps you 'd rather have your dinner ? EDGEWORTHY No . CLAIRE ARCHER We 'll get something later . I want to talk to you . But she does not  --  laughs . Absurd that I should feel bashful with you . Why am I so awkward with words when I go to talk to you ? EDGEWORTHY The words know they 're not needed . CLAIRE ARCHER No , they 're not needed . There 's something underneath  --  an open way  --  down below the way that words can go . rather desperately . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is there . CLAIRE ARCHER Then why do we never  --  go it ? p. 78 EDGEWORTHY If we went it , it would not be there . CLAIRE ARCHER Is that true ? How terrible , if that is true . EDGEWORTHY Not terrible , wonderful  --  that it should  --  of itself  --  be there . CLAIRE ARCHER With the simplicity that can say anything . I want to go it , Tom , I 'm lonely up on top here . Is it that I have more faith than you , or is it only that I 'm greedier ? You see you do n't know  --  Her reckless laugh. what you 're missing . You do n't know how I could love you . EDGEWORTHY Do n't , Claire ; that is n't  --  how it is  --  between you and me . CLAIRE ARCHER But why ca n't it be  --  every way  --  between you and me ? EDGEWORTHY Because we 'd lose  --  the open way . The quality of his denial shows how strong his feeling for her . With anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the only one I want . The only one  --  all of me wants . EDGEWORTHY I know ; but that 's the way it is. p. 79 CLAIRE ARCHER You 're cruel . EDGEWORTHY Oh , Claire , I 'm trying so hard to  --  save it for us . Is n't it our beauty and our safeguard that underneath our separate lives , no matter where we may be , with what other , there is this open way between us ? That 's so much more than anything we could bring to being . CLAIRE ARCHER Perhaps . But  --  it 's different with me . I 'm not  --  all spirit . EDGEWORTHY His hand on her . Dear ! CLAIRE ARCHER No , do n't touch me  --  since  --  Moving. you 're going away tomorrow ? He nods . For  --  always ? His head just moves assent . India is just another country . But there are undiscovered countries . EDGEWORTHY Yes , but we are so feeble we have to reach our country through the actual country lying nearest Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plants ' country ? CLAIRE ARCHER My country ? You mean  --  Outside ? EDGEWORTHY No , I do n't think it that way . p. 80 CLAIRE ARCHER Oh , yes , you do . EDGEWORTHY Your country is the inside , Claire . The innermost . You are disturbed because you lie too close upon the heart of life . CLAIRE ARCHER Restlessly . I do n't know ; you can think it one way  --  or another . No way says it , and that 's good  --  at least it 's not shut up in saying . She is looking at her enclosing hand , as if something is shut up there . EDGEWORTHY But also , you know , things may be freed by expression . Come from the unrealized into the fabric of life . CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , but why does the fabric of life have to  --  freeze into its pattern ? It should  --  doing it with her hands. flow Then turning like an unsatisfied child to him . But I wanted to talk to you . EDGEWORTHY You are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was before  --  your Breath of Life ? CLAIRE ARCHER I 'll know tomorrow . You 'll not go until I know ? EDGEWORTHY I 'll try to stay . p. 81 CLAIRE ARCHER It seems to me , if it has  --  then I have , integrity in  --  Smiles , it is as if the smile lets her say it. otherness . I do n't want to die on the edge ! EDGEWORTHY Not you ! CLAIRE ARCHER Many do . It 's what makes them too smug in all-ness  --  those dead things on the edge , died , distorted  --  trying to get through . Oh  --  do n't think I do n't see  --  The Edge Vine ! A pause , then swiftly . Do you know what I mean ? Or do you think I 'm just a fool , or crazy ? EDGEWORTHY I think I know what you mean , and you know I do n't think you are a fool , or crazy . CLAIRE ARCHER Stabbed to awareness !  --  no matter where it takes you , is n't that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply despite the pattern of pain in her voice . Anguish may be a thread  --  making patterns that have n't been . A thread  --  blue and burning . EDGEWORTHY To take her from what even he fears for her . But you were telling me about the flower you breathed to life . What is your Breath of Life ? p. 82 CLAIRE ARCHER An instant playing . It 's a secret . A secret ?  --  it 's a trick . Distilled from the most fragile flowers there are . It 's only air  --  pausing  --  playing ; except , far in , one stab of red , its quivering heart  --  that asks a question . But here 's the trick  --  I bred the air  --  form to strength . The strength shut up behind us I 've sent  --  far out . Troubled . I 'll know tomorrow . And I have another gift for Breath of Life ; some day  --  though days of work lie in between  --  some day I 'll give it reminiscence . Fragrance that is  --  no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises wet eyes . We need the haunting beauty from the life we 've left . I need that . He takes her hands and breathes her name . Let me reach my country with you . I 'm not a plant . After all , they do n't  --  accept me . Who does  --  accept me ? Will you ? EDGEWORTHY My dear  --  dear , dear , Claire  --  you move me so ! You stand alone in a clearness that breaks my heart . Her hands move up his arms . He takes them to hold them from where they would go  --  though he can hardly do it . But you 've asked what you yourself could answer best . We 'd only stop in the country where everyone stops . p. 83 CLAIRE ARCHER We might come through  --  to radiance . EDGEWORTHY Radiance in an enclosing place . CLAIRE ARCHER Perhaps radiance lighting forms undreamed . Her reckless laugh . I 'd be willing to  --  take a chance , I 'd rather lose than never know . EDGEWORTHY No , Claire . Knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose . CLAIRE ARCHER Would n't men say you were a fool ! EDGEWORTHY They would . CLAIRE ARCHER And perhaps you are . He smiles a little . I feel so desperate , because if only I could  --  show you what I am , you might see I could have without losing . But I 'm a stammering thing with you . EDGEWORTHY You do show me what you are . CLAIRE ARCHER I 've known a few moments that were life . Why do n't they help me now ? One was in the air . I was up with Harry  --  flying  --  high . It was about four months before David was born  --  the doctor was furious  --  pregnant women are supposed to keep to earth . We were going fast  --  I was flying  --  I had left the earth . And then  --  within me , movement , for the first time  --  stirred to life far in air  --  movement within . The man unborn , he too , would fly . And so  --  I always loved him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many flights . I never told anyone about the last one . His little bed was by the window  --  he was n't four years old . It was night , but him not asleep . He saw the morning star  --  you know  --  the morning star . Brighter  --  stranger  --  reminiscent  --  and a promise . He pointed  --  " Mother , " he asked me , " what is there  --  beyond the stars ? " A baby , a sick baby  --  the morning star . Next night  --  the finger that pointed was  --  Suddenly bites her own finger . But , yes , I am glad . He would always have tried to move and too much would hold him . Wonder would die  --  and he 'd laugh at soaring . Looking down , sidewise . Though I liked his voice . So I wish you 'd stay near me  --  for I like your voice , too . p. 84 EDGEWORTHY Claire ! That 's  --  Choked. almost too much . CLAIRE ARCHER One of her swift changes  --  canny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . How can I make it more ? But what she sees brings its own change . I know what it is you 're afraid of . It 's because I have so much  --  yes , why should n't I say it ?  --  passion . You feel that in me , do n't you ? You think it would swamp everything . But that is n't all there is to me . EDGEWORTHY Oh , I know it ! My dearest  --  why it 's because I know it ! You think I am  --  a fool ? CLAIRE ARCHER It 's a thing that 's  --  sometimes more than I am . And yet I  --  I am more than it is . EDGEWORTHY I know . I know about you . CLAIRE ARCHER I do n't know that you do . Perhaps if you really knew about me  --  you would n't go away . EDGEWORTHY You 're making me suffer , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER I know I am . I want to . Why should n't you suffer ? Now seeing it more clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think about you ? You 're afraid of suffering , and so you stop this side  --  in what you persuade yourself is suffering . Waits , then sends it straight . You know  --  how it is  --  with me and Dick ? As she sees him suffer . Oh , no , I do n't want to hurt you ! Let it be you ! I 'll teach you  --  you need n't scorn it . It 's rather wonderful . p. 85 EDGEWORTHY Stop that , Claire ! That is n't you . CLAIRE ARCHER Why are you so afraid  --  of letting me be low  --  if that is low ? You see  --  Cannily . I believe in beauty . I have the faith that can be bad as well as good . And you know why I have the faith ? Because sometimes  --  from my lowest moments  --  beauty has opened as the sea . From a cave I saw immensity . My love , you 're going away  --  Let me tell you how it is with me ; I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Let me tell you how it is with me . I do not want to work , I want to be ; Do not want to make a rose or make a poem  --  Want to lie upon the earth and know . Closes her eyes . Stop doing that !  --  words going into patterns ; They do it sometimes when I let come what 's there . Thoughts take pattern  --  then the pattern is the thing . But let me tell you how it is with me . It flows again . All that I do or say  --  it is to what it comes from ,  --  A drop lifted from the sea . I want to lie upon the earth and know . But  --  scratch a little dirt and make a flower ; Scratch a bit of brain  --  something like a poem . Covering her face . Stop doing that . Help me stop doing that ! p. 86 EDGEWORTHY And from the place where she had carried him . Do n't talk at all . Lie still and know  --  And know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are so weak we have to talk ; To talk  --  to touch . Why ca n't I rest in knowing I would give my life to reach you ? That has  --  all there is . But I must  --  put my timid hands upon you , Do something about infinity . Oh , let what will flow into us , And fill us full  --  and leave us still . Wring me dry , And let me fill again with life more pure . To know  --  to feel , And do nothing with what I feel and know  --  That 's being good . That 's nearer God . Drenched in the feeling that has flowed through her  --  but surprised  --  helpless . Why , I said your thing , did n't I ? Opened my life to bring you to me , and what came  --  is what sends you away . EDGEWORTHY No ! What came is what holds us together . What came is what saves us from ever going apart . Brokenly . My beautiful one . You  --  you brave flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a flower . I am too torn . If you have anything  --  Help me . Breathe .

Breathe  --  Let me know in calm . Then  --  trouble me , trouble me  --  for other moments  --  in father calm . Slow , motionless , barely articulate EDGEWORTHY As she does not move he lifts his head . And even as he looks at her , she does not move , nor look at him . Claire  --  His hand out to her , a little afraid . You went away from me then . You are away from me now . CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , and I could go on . But I will come back . It is hard to do . She brings much with her . That , too , I will give you  --  my by-myself-ness . That 's the uttermost I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But let us do it  --  the great sacrilege ! Yes ! Excited , she rises ; she has his hands , and brings him up beside her . Let us take the mad chance ! Perhaps it 's the only way to save  --  What 's there . How do we know ? How can we know ? Risk . Risk everything . From all that flows into us , let it rise ! All that we never thought to use to make a moment  --  let it flow into what could be ! Bring all into life between us  --  or send all down to death ! Oh , do you know what I am doing ? Risk , risk everything . Why are you so afraid to lose ? What holds you from me ? Test all . Let it live or let it die . It is our chance  --  our chance to bear  --  what 's there . My dear one  --  I will love you so . With all of me .

That 's nothing . This is n't that . Fearing . I tell you  --  it is n't that . Yes , I know  --  that 's amorous  --  enclosing . I know  --  a little place . This is n't that . Her arms going around him  --  all the lure of " that " while she pleads against it as it comes up to them . We will come out  --  to radiance  --  in far places . Admitting , using .

EDGEWORTHY Drenched in her passion , but fighting . It 's you . In anguish . You rare thing untouched  --  not  --  not into this  --  not back into this  --  by me  --  lover of your apartness . She steps back . She sees he can not . She stands there , before what she wanted more than life , and almost had , and lost . A long moment . Then she runs down the stairs . p. 89 CLAIRE ARCHER Her voice coming up . Harry ! Choke that phonograph ! If you want to be lewd  --  do it yourselves ! You tawdry things  --  you cheap little lewd cowards  --  A door heard opening below . Harry ! If you do n't stop that music , I 'll kill myself . Far down , steps on stairs . HARRY ARCHER Claire , what is this ? CLAIRE ARCHER Stop that phonograph or I 'll  --  HARRY ARCHER Why of course I 'll stop it . What  --  what is there to get so excited about ? Now  --  now just a minute , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs , dragging steps , face ghastly . The amorous song still comes up , and louder now , that doors are open . She and Tom do not look at one another . Then , on a langorous swell the music comes to a grating stop . They do not speak or move . Quick footsteps  --  Harry comes up . HARRY ARCHER What in the world were you saying , Claire ? Certainly you could have asked me more quietly to turn off the Victrola . Though what harm was it doing you  --  way up here ? A sharp little sound from Claire ; she checks it , her hand over her mouth . Harry looks from her to Tom . Well I think you two would better have had your dinner . Wo n't you come down now and have some ? p. 90 CLAIRE ARCHER Only now taking her hand from her mouth . Harry , tell him to come up here  --  that insanity man . I  --  want to ask him something . HARRY ARCHER " Insanity man ! " How absurd . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLAIRE ARCHER Is there ? Anyway , ask him to come up here . Want to  --  ask him something . EDGEWORTHY Speaking with difficulty . Would n't it be better for us to go down there ? CLAIRE ARCHER No . So nice up here ! Everybody  --  up here ! HARRY ARCHER Worried . You 'll  --  be yourself , will you , Claire ? She checks a laugh , nods . I think he can help you . CLAIRE ARCHER Want to ask him to  --  help me . HARRY ARCHER As he is starting down . He 's here as a guest tonight , you know , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER I suppose a guest can  --  help one . EDGEWORTHY When the silence rejects it . Claire , you must know , it 's because it is so much , so  --  p. 91 CLAIRE ARCHER Be still . There is n't anything to say . EDGEWORTHY Torn  --  tortured . If it only were n't you ! CLAIRE ARCHER Yes ,  --  so you said . If it were n't I. I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up below  --  keeps looking at the place where they will appear . Harry is heard to call , " Coming , Dick ? " and Dick 's voice replies , " In a moment or two . " Adelaide comes first . ADELAIDE As her head appears . Well , these stairs should keep down weight . You missed an awfully good dinner , Claire . And kept Mr. Edgeworthy from a good dinner . CLAIRE ARCHER Yes . We missed our dinner . Her eyes do not leave the place where Dr. Emmons will come up . HARRY ARCHER As he and Emmons appear . Claire , this is  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , I know who he is . I want to ask you  --  ADELAIDE Let the poor man get his breath before you ask him anything . He nods , smiles , looks at Claire with interest . Careful not to look too long at her , surveys the tower . p. 92 DR . EMMONS Curious place . ADELAIDE Yes ; it lacks form , does n't it ? CLAIRE ARCHER What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her agitation ; she is backed against the curved wall , as far as possible from them . Harry looks at her in alarm , then in resentment at Tom who takes a step nearer Claire . HARRY ARCHER Trying to be light . Do n't take it so hard Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER To Emmons . It must be very interesting  --  helping people go insane . ADELAIDE Claire ! How preposterous . DR . EMMONS Easily . I hope that 's not precisely what we do . ADELAIDE With the smile of one who is going to " cover it . " Trust Claire to put it in the unique and  --  amusing way . CLAIRE ARCHER Amusing ? You are amused ? But it does n't matter . To the doctor . I think it is very kind of you  --  helping people go insane . I suppose they have all sorts of reasons for having to do it  --  reasons why they ca n't stay sane any longer . But tell me , how do they do it ? It 's not so easy to  --  get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 DR . EMMONS I 'd like immensely to have a talk with you about all this some day . ADELAIDE Certainly this is not the time , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER The time ? When you  --  ca n't go any farther  --  is n't that  --  ADELAIDE Capably taking the whole thing into matter-of-factness . What I think is , Claire has worked too long with plants . There 's something  --  not quite sound about making one thing into another thing . What we need is unity . From Claire something like a moan . Yes dear , we do need it  --  To the doctor . I ca n't say that I believe in making life over like this . I do n't think the new species are worth it . At least I do n't believe in it for Claire . If one is an intense , sensitive person  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Is n't there any way to stop her ? Always  --  always smothering it with the word for it ? DR . EMMONS Soothingly . But she ca n't smother it . Anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLAIRE ARCHER Looking at him with eyes too bright . Then you do n't see it either . Angry . Yes , she can hurt it ! Piling it up  --  always piling it up  --  between us and  --  What there . Clogging the way  --  always  --  To Emmons . I want to cease to know ! That 's all I ask . Darken it . Darken it . If you came to help me , strike me blind ! p. 94 DR . EMMONS You 're really all tired out , are n't you ? Oh , we 've got to get you rested . CLAIRE ARCHER They  --  deny it saying they have it ; and he  --  half looks at Tom  --  quickly looks away others , deny it  --  afraid of losing it . We 're in the way . Ca n't you see the dead stuff piled in the path ? Pointing . DEMMING Voice coming up . Me too ? CLAIRE ARCHER Staring at the path , hearing his voice a moment after it has come . Yes , Dick  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come up . What is there any more than you are ? DEMMING Embarrassed by the intensity , but laughing . A question not at all displeasing to me . Who can answer it ? CLAIRE ARCHER More and more excited . Yes ! Who can answer it ? Going to him , in terror . Let me go with you  --  and be with you  --  and know nothing else ! ADELAIDE Gasping . Why  --  ! p. 95 HARRY ARCHER Claire ! This is going a little too  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Far ? But you have to go far to  --  Clinging to Dick . Only a place to hide your head  --  what else is there to hope for ? I ca n't stay with them  --  piling it up ! Always  --  piling it up ! I ca n't get through to  --  he wo n't let me through to  --  what I do n't know is there ! As Dick would help her regain herself . Do n't push me away ! Do n't  --  do n't stand me up , I will go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and remember  --  what we 've tried to forget ! ADELAIDE It 's time to stop this by force  --  if there 's no other way . The doctor shakes his head . CLAIRE ARCHER All I ask is to die in the gutter with everyone spitting on me . Changes to a curious weary smiling quiet . Still , why should they bother to do that ? HARRY ARCHER Brokenly . You 're sick , Claire . There 's no denying it . Looks at Emmons , who nods . ADELAIDE Something to quiet her  --  to stop it . p. 96 CLAIRE ARCHER Throwing her arms around Dick . You , Dick . Not them . Not  --  any of them . DEMMING Claire , you are overwrought . You must  --  HARRY ARCHER To Dick , as if only now realizing that phase of it . I 'll tell you one thing , you 'll answer to me for this ! He starts for Dick  --  is restrained by Emmons , chiefly by his grave shake of the head . With Harry 's move to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Keep me . You have mercy ! You will have mercy . Anything  --  everything  --  that will let me be nothing ! Curtain @x In the greenhouse , the same as Act I. Anthony is bedding small plants where the Edge Vine grew . In the inner room the plant like caught motion glows as from a light within . Hattie , the Maid , rushes in from outside . ANTHONY Turning angrily . You are not what this place  --  HATTIE Anthony , come in the house . I 'm afraid . Mr. Archer , I never saw him like this . He 's talking to Mr. Demming  --  something about Mrs. Archer . ANTHONY Who in spite of himself is disturbed by her agitation . And if it is , it 's no business of yours . HATTIE You do n't know how he is . I went in the room and  --  ANTHONY Well , he wo n't hurt you , will he ? HATTIE How do I know who he 'll hurt  --  a person 's whose  --  Seeing how to get him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then smiles . No ; he wo n't hurt Miss Claire . p. 98 HATTIE What do you know about it ?  --  out here in the plant house ? ANTHONY And I do n't want to know about it . This is a very important day for me . It 's Breath of Life I 'm thinking of today  --  not you and Mr. Archer . HATTIE Well suppose he does something to Mr. Demming ? ANTHONY Mr. Demming will have to look out for himself , I am at work . Resuming work . HATTIE Do n't you think I ought to tell Mrs. Archer that  --  ANTHONY You let her alone ! This is no day for her to be bothered by you . At eleven o'clock  --  Looks at watch.  --  she comes out here  --  to Breath of Life . HATTIE With greed for gossip . Did you see any of them when they came downstairs last night ? ANTHONY I was attending to my own affairs . HATTIE They was all excited . Mr. Edgeworthy  --  he went away . He was gone all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the milkman woke me up . Now he 's packing his things . He wanted to get to Mrs. Archer too  --  just a little while ago . But she wo n't open her door for none of them . I ca n't even get in to do her room . p. 99 ANTHONY Then do some other room  --  and leave me alone in this room . HATTIE A little afraid of what she is asking . Is she sick , Anthony  --  or what ? Vindicating herself , as he gives her a look . That doctor he stayed here late . But she 'd locked herself in . I heard Mr. Archer  --  ANTHONY You heard too much ! He starts for the door , to make her leave , but Dick rushes in . Looks around wildly , goes to the trap door , finds it locked . ANTHONY What are you doing here ? DEMMING Trying not to be shot  --  if you must know . This is the only place I can think of  --  till he comes to his senses and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ignominious  --  but better be absurd than be dead . HATTIE Has he got the revolver ? DEMMING Gone for it . Thought I would n't sit there till he got back . To Anthony . Look here  --  do n't you get the idea ? Get me some place where he ca n't come . ANTHONY It is not what this place is for . p. 100 DEMMING Any place is for saving a man 's life . HATTIE Sure , Anthony . Mrs. Archer would n't want Mr. Demming shot . DEMMING That 's right , Anthony . Miss Claire will be angry at you if you get me shot . He makes for the door of the inner room . ANTHONY You ca n't go in there . It 's locked . Harry rushes in from outside . HARRY ARCHER I thought so ! He has the revolver . Hattie screams . ANTHONY Now Mr. Archer , if you 'll just stop and think , you 'll know Miss Claire would n't want Mr. Demming shot . HARRY ARCHER You think that can stop me ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dog that  --  ANTHONY Keeping squarely between Harry and Dick . Well , you ca n't shoot him in here . It is not good for the plants . Harry is arrested by this reason . And especially not today . Why , Mr. Archer , Breath of Life may flower today . It 's years Miss Claire 's been working for this day . p. 101 HARRY ARCHER I never thought to see this day ! ANTHONY No , did you ? Oh , it will be a wonderful day . And how she has worked for it . She has an eye that sees what is n't right in what looks right . Many 's the time I 've thought  --  Here the form is set  --  and then she 'd say " We 'll try this one , " and it had  --  what I had n't known was there . She 's like that . HARRY ARCHER I 've always been pleased , Anthony , at the way you 've worked with Miss Claire . This is hardly the time to stand there eulogizing her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know she is . ANTHONY Proudly . Oh , I know that ! You think I could work with her and not know she 's more than I know she is ? HARRY ARCHER Well if you love her you 've got to let me shoot the dirty dog that drags her down ! ANTHONY Not in here . Not today . More than like you 'd break the glass . And Breath of Life 's in there . HARRY ARCHER Anthony , this is pretty clever of you  --  but  --  ANTHONY I 'm not clever . But I know how easy it is to turn life back . No , I 'm not clever at all , Claire has appeared and is looking in from outside but I do know  --  there are things you must n't hurt . He sees her . Yes , here 's Miss Claire . She comes in . She is looking immaculate . p. 102 CLAIRE ARCHER From the gutter I rise again , refreshed . One does , you know . Nothing is fixed  --  not even the gutter . Smilingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you like the way I entertained the nerve specialist ? HARRY ARCHER Claire ! You can joke about it ? CLAIRE ARCHER Taking the revolver from the hand she has shocked to limpness . Whom are you trying to make hear ? HARRY ARCHER I 'm trying to make the world hear that pointing there stands a dirty dog who  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Listen , Harry . Turning to Hattie , who is over by the tall plants at right , not wanting to be shot but not wanting to miss the conversation . You can do my room now , Hattie . Hattie goes . If you 're thinking of shooting Dick , you ca n't shoot him while he 's backed up against that door . ANTHONY Just what I told them , Miss Claire . Just what I told them . CLAIRE ARCHER And for that matter , it 's quite dull of you to have any idea of shooting him . p. 103 HARRY ARCHER I may be dull  --  I know you think I am  --  but I 'll show you that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make yourself ridiculous ? If I ran out and hid my head in the mud , would you think you had to shoot the mud ? DEMMING Stung out of fear . That 's pretty cruel ! CLAIRE ARCHER Well , would you rather be shot ? HARRY ARCHER So you just said it to protect him ! CLAIRE ARCHER I change it to grass . Nodding to Dick . Grass . If I hid my face in the grass , would you have to burn the grass ? HARRY ARCHER Oh , Claire , how can you ? When you know how I love you  --  and how I 'm suffering ? CLAIRE ARCHER With interest . Are you suffering ? HARRY ARCHER Have n't you eyes ? CLAIRE ARCHER I should think it would  --  do something to you . HARRY ARCHER God ! Have you no heart ? The door opens . Tom comes in. p. 104 CLAIRE ARCHER Scarcely saying it . Yes , I have a heart . EDGEWORTHY After a pause . I came to say good-bye . CLAIRE ARCHER God ! Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick is shot ? EDGEWORTHY Claire ! Now sees the revolver in her hand that is turned from him . Going to her . Claire ! CLAIRE ARCHER And even you think this is so important ? Carelessly raises the revolver , and with her left hand out flat , tells Tom not to touch her . Harry thinks it important he shoot Dick , and Dick thinks it important not to be shot , and you think I must n't shoot anybody  --  even myself  --  and ca n't any of you see that none of that is as important as  --  where revolvers ca n't reach ? Putting revolver where there is no Edge Vine . I shall never shoot myself . I 'm too interested in destruction to cut it short by shooting . After looking from one to the other , laughs . Pointing . One  --  two  --  three . You-love-me . But why do you bring it out here ? ANTHONY Who has resumed work . It is not what this place is for . p. 105 CLAIRE ARCHER No . This place is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is eleven . At eleven we are to go in and see  --  CLAIRE ARCHER Whether it has gone through . But how can we go  --  with Dick against that door ? ANTHONY He 'll have to move . CLAIRE ARCHER And be shot ? HARRY ARCHER Irritably . Oh , he 'll not be shot . Claire can spoil anything . Dick steps away from the door ; Claire takes a step nearer it . CLAIRE ARCHER Halting . Have I spoiled everything ? I do n't want to go in there . ANTHONY We 're going in together , Miss Claire . Do n't you remember ? Oh  --  Looking resentfully at the others.  --  do n't let any little thing spoil it for you  --  the work of all those days  --  the hope of so many days . CLAIRE ARCHER Yes  --  that 's it . ANTHONY You 're afraid you have n't done it ? p. 106 CLAIRE ARCHER Yes , but  --  afraid I have . HARRY ARCHER Cross , but kindly . That 's just nervousness , Claire . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying . CLAIRE ARCHER Curiously grateful . You have , Harry ? HARRY ARCHER Glad enough to be back in a more usual world . Sure . I 've been afraid to know , and almost as afraid of having done it as of not having done it . Claire nods , steps nearer , then again pulls back . CLAIRE ARCHER I ca n't go in there . She almost looks at Tom . Not today ANTHONY But Miss Claire , there 'll be things to see today we ca n't see tomorrow . CLAIRE ARCHER You bring it in here ! ANTHONY In  --  Out from its own place ? She nods . And  --  where they are ? Again she nods . Reluctantly he goes to the door . I will not look into the heart . No one must know before you know . In the inner room , his head a little turned away , he is seen very carefully to lift the plant which glows from within . As he brings it in , no one looks at it . Harry takes a box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the newcomer may have a place . p. 107 ANTHONY Breath of Life is here , Miss Claire . Claire half turns , then stops . CLAIRE ARCHER Look  --  and see  --  what you see . ANTHONY No one should see what you 've not seen . CLAIRE ARCHER I ca n't see  --  until I know . Anthony looks into the flower . ANTHONY Agitated . Miss Claire ! CLAIRE ARCHER It has come through ? ANTHONY It has gone on . CLAIRE ARCHER Stronger ? ANTHONY Stronger , surer . CLAIRE ARCHER And more fragile ? ANTHONY And more fragile . CLAIRE ARCHER Look deep . No  --  turning back ? ANTHONY After a searching look . The form is set . He steps back from it . CLAIRE ARCHER Then it is  --  out . From where she stands she turns slowly to the plant . You were n't . You are . p. 108 ANTHONY But come and see , Miss Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER It 's so much more than  --  I 'd see . HARRY ARCHER Well I 'm going to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before ! There seems something alive  --  inside this outer shell . DEMMING He too looking in and he has an artist 's manner of a hand up to make the light right . It 's quite new in form . It  --  says something about form . HARRY ARCHER Cordially to Claire , who stands apart . So you 've really put it over . Well well ,  --  congratulations . It 's a good deal of a novelty , I should say , and I 've no doubt you 'll have a considerable success with it  --  people always like something new . I 'm mighty glad  --  after all your work , and I hope it will  --  set you up . CLAIRE ARCHER Low  --  and like a machine . Will you all  --  go away ? Anthony goes  --  into the other room . HARRY ARCHER Why  --  why , yes . But  --  oh , Claire ! Ca n't you take some pleasure in your work ? As she stands there very still . Emmons says you need a good long rest  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't this help you , Claire ? Let this be release . This  --  breath of the uncaptured . CLAIRE ARCHER And though speaking , she remains just as still . Breath of the uncaptured ? You are a novelty . Out ? You have been brought in . A thousand years from now , when you are but a form too long repeated , Perhaps the madness that gave you birth will burst again , And from the prison that is you will leap pent queernesses To make a form that has n't been  --  To make a prison new . And this we call creation . Very low , her head not coming up . Go away ! Tom goes ; Harry hesitates , looking in anxiety at Claire . He starts to go , stops , looks at Dick , from him to Claire . But goes . A moment later , Dick moves near Claire ; stands uncertainly , then puts a hand upon her . She starts , only then knowing he is there . CLAIRE ARCHER A slight shrinking away , but not really reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer her creation . She looks into what has n't been . With her breath , and by a gentle moving of her hands , she fans it to fuller openness . As she does this Tom returns and from outside is looking in at her . Softly he opens the door and comes in . She does not know that he is there . In the way she looks at the flower he looks at her . p. 110 EDGEWORTHY Claire  --  She lifts her head . As you stood there , looking into the womb you breathed to life , you were beautiful to me beyond any other beauty . You were life and its reach and its anguish . I ca n't go away from you . I will never go away from you . It shall all be  --  as you wish . I can go with you where I could not go alone . If this is delusion , I want that delusion . It 's more than any reality I could attain . As she does not move . Speak to me , Claire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speak to you ? Pause . Do I know who you are ? EDGEWORTHY I think you do . CLAIRE ARCHER Oh , yes . I love you . That 's who you are . Waits again . But why are you something  --  very far away ? EDGEWORTHY Come nearer . CLAIRE ARCHER Nearer ? Feeling it with her voice . Nearer . But I think I am going  --  the other way . EDGEWORTHY No , Claire  --  come to me . Did you understand , dear . I am not going away . p. 111 CLAIRE ARCHER You 're not going away ? EDGEWORTHY Not without you , Claire . And you and I will be together . Is that  --  what you wanted ? CLAIRE ARCHER Wanted ? As if wanting is something that harks far back . But the word calls to her passion . Wanted ! A sob , hands out , she goes to him . But before his arms can take her , she steps back . Are you trying to pull me down into what I wanted ? Are you here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I love you because it is not in you to stop . CLAIRE ARCHER And loving me for that  --  would stop me ? Oh , help me see it ! It is so important that I see it . EDGEWORTHY It is important . It is our lives . CLAIRE ARCHER And more than that . I can not see it because it is so much more than that . EDGEWORTHY Do n't try to see all that it is . From peace you 'll see a little more . CLAIRE ARCHER Peace ? Troubled as we are when looking at what we can not see clearly . What is peace ? Peace is what the struggle knows in moments very far apart . Peace  --  that is not a place to rest . Are you resting ? What are you ? You who 'd take me from what I am to something else ? p. 112 EDGEWORTHY I thought you knew , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER I know  --  what you pass for . But are you beauty ? Beauty is that only living pattern  --  the trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , Claire . I never thought you doubted that . CLAIRE ARCHER Beauty is  --  She turns to Breath of Life , as if to learn it there , but turns away with a sob . If I can not go to you now  --  I will always be alone . Tom takes her in his arms . She is shaken , then comes to rest . EDGEWORTHY Yes  --  rest . And then  --  come into joy . You have so much life for joy . CLAIRE ARCHER Raising her head , called by promised gladness . We 'll run around together . Lovingly he nods . Up hills . All night on hills . EDGEWORTHY Tenderly . All night on hills . CLAIRE ARCHER We 'll go on the sea in a little boat . EDGEWORTHY On the sea in a little boat . p. 113 CLAIRE ARCHER But  --  there are other boats on other seas . Drawing back from him , troubled . There are other boats on other seas . EDGEWORTHY Drawing her back to him . My dearest  --  not now , not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would love those hours with you . I want them . I want you ! They kiss  --  but deep in her is sobbing . Reminiscence . Her hand feeling his arm as we touch what we would remember . Reminiscence . With one of her swift changes steps back from him . How dare you pass for what you 're not ? We , are tired , and so we think it 's you . Stop with you . Do n't get through  --  to what you 're in the way of . Beauty is not something you say about beauty . EDGEWORTHY I say little about beauty , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER Your life says it . By standing far off you pass for it . Smother it with a life that passes for it . But beauty  --  Getting it from the flower . Beauty is the humility breathed from the shame of succeeding . p. 114 EDGEWORTHY But it may all be within one 's self , dear . CLAIRE ARCHER Drawn by this , but held , and desperate because she is held . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why must I distrust you now ? When I love you  --  with all of me , why do I know that only you are worth my hate ? EDGEWORTHY It 's the fear of easy satisfactions . I love you for it . CLAIRE ARCHER Over the flower . Breath of Life  --  you here ? Are you lonely  --  Breath of Life ? EDGEWORTHY Claire  --  hear me ! Do n't go where we ca n't go . As there you made a shell for life within , make for yourself a life in which to live . It must be so . CLAIRE ARCHER As you made for yourself a shell called beauty ? EDGEWORTHY What is there for you , if you 'll have no touch with what we have ? CLAIRE ARCHER What is there ? There are the dreams we have n't dreamed . There is that long and flowing pattern  --  She follows that but suddenly and as if blindly , goes to him . I am tired . I am lonely . I 'm afraid . He holds her , soothing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lonely  --  and afraid , we stop with you . Do n't get through  --  to what you 're in the way of . p. 115 EDGEWORTHY Then you do n't love me ? CLAIRE ARCHER I 'm fighting for my chance . I do n't know  --  which chance . Is drawn to the other chance , to Breath of Life . Looks into it as if to look through to the uncaptured . And through this life just caught comes the truth she chants . I 've wallowed at a coarse man 's feet , I 'm sprayed with dreams we 've not yet come to . I 've gone so low that words ca n't get there , I 've never pulled the mantle of my fears around me And called it loneliness  --  And called it God . Only with life that waits have I kept faith . With effort raising her eyes to the man . And only you have ever threatened me . EDGEWORTHY Coming to her , and with strength now . And I will threaten you . I 'm here to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're trying what we ca n't do . CLAIRE ARCHER What else is there worth trying ? EDGEWORTHY I love you , and I will keep you  --  from fartherness  --  from harm . You are mine , and you will stay with me ! Roughly . You hear me ? You will stay with me ! p. 116 CLAIRE ARCHER Her head on his breast , in ecstacy of rest . Drowsily . You can keep me ? EDGEWORTHY Darling ! I can keep you . I will keep you  --  safe . CLAIRE ARCHER Troubled by the word , but barely able to raise her head . Safe ? EDGEWORTHY Bringing her to rest again . Trust me , Claire . CLAIRE ARCHER Not lifting her head , but turning it so she sees Breath of Life . Now can I trust  --  what is ? Suddenly pushing him roughly away . No ! I will beat my life to pieces in the struggle to  --  EDGEWORTHY To what , Claire ? CLAIRE ARCHER Not to stop it by seeming to have it . With fury . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never stop myself  --  or any one  --  with the thought it 's what I have . I 'd rather be the steam rising from the manure than be a thing called beautiful ! With sight too clear . Now I know who you are . It is you puts out the breath of life . Image of beauty  --  You fill the place  --  should be a gate . In agony . Oh , that it is you  --  fill the place  --  should be a gate ! My darling ! That it should be you who  --  Her hands moving on him . Let me tell you something . Never was loving strong as my loving of you ! Do you know that ? Oh , know that ! Know it now ! Her arms go around his neck . Hours with you  --  I 'd give my life to have ! That it should be you  --  He would loosen her hands , for he can not breathe . But when she knows she is choking him , that knowledge is fire burning its way into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 117 EDGEWORTHY Words coming from a throat not free . Claire ! What are you doing ? Then she knows what she is doing . CLAIRE ARCHER To his resistance . No ! You are too much ! You are not enough . Still wanting not to hurt her , he is slow in getting free . He keeps stepping backward trying , in growing earnest , to loosen her hands . But he does not loosen them before she has found the place in his throat that cuts off breath . As he gasps . Breath of Life  --  my gift  --  to you ! She has pushed him against one of the plants at right as he sways , strength she never had before pushes him over backward , just as they have struggled from sight . Violent crash of glass is heard . EDGEWORTHY Faint smothered voice . No . I 'm  --  hurt . CLAIRE ARCHER In the frenzy and agony of killing . Oh gift ! Oh gift ! There is no sound . Claire rises  --  steps back  --  is seen now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know where she is , she moves into the room  --  looks around . Takes a step toward Breath of Life , turns and goes quickly to the door . Stops , as if stopped . Sees the revolver where the Edge Vine was . Slowly goes to it . Holds it as if she can not think what it is for . Then raises it high and fires above through the place in the glass left open for ventilation . Anthony comes from the inner room . His eyes go from her to the body beyond . Harry rushes in from outside . p. 118 HARRY ARCHER Who fired that ? CLAIRE ARCHER I did . Lonely . Seeing Anthony 's look , Harry 's eyes follow it . HARRY ARCHER Oh ! What ? What ? Dick comes running in . Who ? Claire ! Dick sees  --  goes to Tom . CLAIRE ARCHER Yes . I did it . MY  --  Gift . HARRY ARCHER Is he  --  ? He is n't  --  ? He is n't  --  ? Tries to go in there . Can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position being changed  --  then Dick reappears . DEMMING His voice in jerks . It 's  --  it 's no use , but I 'll go for a doctor . HARRY ARCHER No  --  no . Oh , I suppose  --  Falling down beside Claire  --  his face against her . My darling ! How can I save you now ? CLAIRE ARCHER Speaking each word very carefully . Saved  --  myself . ANTHONY I did it . Do n't you see ? I did n't want so many around . Not  --  what this place is for . p. 119 HARRY ARCHER Snatching at this but lets it go . She would n't let  --  Looking up at Claire  --  then quickly hiding his face . And  --  do n't you see ? CLAIRE ARCHER Out . A little like a child 's pleased surprise . Out . Dick stands there , as if unable to get to the door  --  his face distorted , biting his hand . ANTHONY Miss Claire ! You can do anything  --  wo n't you try ? CLAIRE ARCHER Reminiscence ? Speaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles a little . Anthony takes Reminiscence , the flower she was breeding for fragrance for Breath of Life  --  holds it out to her . But she has taken a step forward , past them all . CLAIRE ARCHER Out . As if feeling her way . Nearer , Her voice now feeling the way to it . Nearer  --  Voice almost upon it .  --  my God . Falling upon it with surprise . To Thee , Breathing it . Nearer  --  to Thee , E'en though it be  --  A slight turn of the head toward the dead man she loves  --  a mechanical turn just as far the other way . a cross That Her head going down . raises me ; Her head slowly coming up  --  singing it . Still all my song shall be Nearer my  --  Slowly the curtain begins to shut her out . The last word heard is the final Nearer  --  a faint breath from far .
