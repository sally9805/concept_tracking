txt Day of Prayer to Stop Crime . On the front page of Tun Taus of Oct. 4 this bit of good news appeared : " No crime on Saturday night in Manhattan and the Bronx . " This is very unusual In that it is the first time in the history of the Bronx that a " no crime " report was sent In to the Pollee Department for Saturday night and Sunday morning . We believe this is a direct result of our all day of prayer which took place Friday . Oct. 1 , and in which thousands of people living in Harlem , Washington Heights and the Bronx took part . This may be a good idea for other communities who have tried to settle the crime wave In almost every other way than by prayer . We believe that this is the first time In the history of church work in the Bronx or Manhattan where a day of prayer was set apart for the purpose of solving crime conditions . THOMAS B.
