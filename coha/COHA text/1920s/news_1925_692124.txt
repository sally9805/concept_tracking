txt Wall Street paid the penalty yesterday of . its stock market excesses ' of . recent months . Frightened by the . spectre of higher money rates and a ? generiir t ! ghtening up of Federal Reserve ilitzik credits , speculators and holders of stock , alike poured stocks into the market in such tremeiadaus avalanChe of gelling as to exceed all ' previous records and - to-  bring about a debacle ' - on the ? Stock Exchange . Representative ' Issues lie .. tilifed from 5 to as much as 24% points , knii= " titti " itik , ' the ' entire day the market sins in- a iritatre of chhos such as has not been witnessed in the memory of even the oldest trader . For the fourth day in the history of the Exchange the record of more than A000,000 shares of-stock passed under the wheel of the tickers . Total sales were 3,448,747 shares , the largest number in- any single day in the history of the Exchange . The decline in the induatrial ' shares of 6.74 was the greatest ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and at the close of the market there was a virtual collapse of many of ' the issues which were recent speculative favorites . Many records were smashed , yesterday in Walt Street . One was that of a single hour 's trading . The turnover in the hour between 2 and 3 o'clock was 1,051,500 shares , , the , heaviest turnover in one hour since the Northern Pacific panic of May 9 , 1901 when the turnover ( the nearest comp/arable ) was 1 ; 034,100 shares . The decline In the industrial stocks of 6.74 also was entirely unprecedented . Worst Break on Record . There are few days with which yesterday 's hectic session on the Stock Exchange may be compared . One was the Northern Pacific panic in 1901 , In which two powerful banking groups attempted to gain control of a single railroad . Another was the " peace leak " market . in which the possibility of immediate peace threatened to put an end to the boom in the excited market for " war brides , " that is ; corporate stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allied Governments . Their breaks , however , were small and insignificant compared with the damage done In yesterday 's market , which came out of a clear sky . It Is axiomatic in Wall Street that its most important news comes unexpectedly . For many weeks the financial district feared an advance in the rediscount rate of the Federal Reserve Bark of New York , harking back to the days in 1919 when the Federal Reserve rate wall advanced as an out and out brake to speculation , which , had literally Inni wild . T is possibility has caused a reaction-every Thursdays when the New York board meets , in recent weeks . The likelihood of an exterior bank of the Reserve system raising its rate had not eveii been dreamed of in speculative quarters . New York had heretofore usually taken the lead . Therefore , when . the Boston Federal Reserve Bank raised its rediscount rate from , 31/4 to 4 per cent. , effective yesterday , occurring after the close of the Market on Monday , - when stocks were at approximately - ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial district as a signal by too Federal Reserve Board to the speculators that they bad gone too far and too fast , Beason for Bate ... Advance . Special reasons existed , it was pointed out , for the advance in the rate of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank . Nevertheless ; Wall Street as . a.  - -  whole , having in mind 1910 , construed this ' advance as a warning and probably as a , prophecy that an advance in the New York rate was to be anticipated . ? ' The market of the previous day had been a nervous None . All eyes Were centred onthe opening yesterday morning and the reaction of speculative sentiment to the . overnight - developments . Probably more eyes were ' - ifixed on -- the ticker at the opening than ever before . Stocks were moderately lower at the start , but the reactions at that time were not extensive and gave no hint of the panic which was to take place later in the day . After the opening there was a brief rally . Then the heavy selling started , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 to 5 points . There was a brief respite between 12 and 1 o'clock . Pressure increased as the day progressed and the market 's weakest point , when the most stock was offered for sale " at the market . " occurred between 2 and 3 o'clock . Final prices of the day were in many cases the lowest not only for the day but for many weeks . In a single fivehour trading period the gains which had been laboriously built up in many market leaders were suddenly wiped out . Record of Some Trading . The record of trading in yesterday 's market and the declines , which ranged from 4% points in Steel to 24% points in Chrysler Motors , is shown in the following table of the high , low . closing prices and net change in the fifteen stocks which have been ? the market leaders during the last few weeks : Net High .

What occurred was that the morning selling reached any number of stop-loss orders and these in turn touched off further orders , causing many of the speculative issues to collapse like a house of cards . Each new sale overlapped the preceding one and caused a weakening of the entire structure on which the bull market was built . Motor stocks , which have been the leaders of the present upward movement , were the hardest hit . Sales of these shares appeared at intervals on the tape in tremendous volume , and at such receding prices that Wall Street as a whole was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual market value of the shares of most of the motor companies of the country . Frequently there was as much as 10 points difference between the Prices current on the Stock Exchange tor any particular shares and the price appearing currently on the tape . Tickers Far Behind . Stock Exchange facilities were entirely inadequate to handle the business which rolled in during the afternoon , and at the close the ticker was exactly thirty minutes behind the market . At one time Chrysler Motors was selling on the floor of the Exchange at 207. when its last ticker sale was.215 . The same was true of United States Steel . . American Cant United States Cast Iron Pipe and other stocks in which there has been big speculation . Under such circumstances trading during the afternoon was chaotic . Under this tremendous wave of selling , pools which had been supporting shares and marking them up , either had to stand in the breach , take all the stock offered and probably hold up their quotations , or step aside and allow the stocks to seek their own levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bids which have been so evident during the last few weeks , were entirely absent at the close , and stocks were allowed to go the entire distance which the persistent selling forced them The havoc created in customers ' accounts by the unexpected decline in the stock market was the greatest ever wrought in such a short period . During the last few weeks a large public participation has been attracted to the market by advancing prices . innumerable market calls went out from Wall Street last night , and as the financial district viewed it at the close , this may prove a factor in the opening today , because of the fact that many of the margin calls are bound to be unanswered , which will mean stock sold " at the market . " Rush to Get Out of Market . The decline in stocks occurred in the face of the best news the market has had this week from an industrial standpoint . This was an increase of 391,886 tons in the unfilled orders of the United States Steel Corporation , bringing the total to 4,109,183 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Steel Corporation In any single month this year , and bore out the prediction that steel operations were on the increase . In the Lace of this , United States Steel common , the market 's bellwether , was forcefully sold throughout most of the- day , - and in fact , lost all of the advantage it bad gained marketwise during the last fortnight . No one in the financial district appeared to pay much attention to the news of the day . The market was too fast and furious . The main idea was to get out of the market and at the best possible price . Directors of New York Federal Reserve Bank will meet on Thursday , but there is a well defined opinion in Wall Street , that no change will be made in the New York rate immediately , because of the fact that a tacit understanding exists between the New York Bank and Governors of the Bank of England on the rediscount rate problem . It is felt that any change in the existing rafes of discount of these two banks might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two institutions which also involves the question of sterling . Loans by all of the banks on Stock Exchange collateral increased by $37 , - 000,000 last week . These loans have increased . by $167,000,000 in a month and are up approximately 8206,000,000 since the end of August , as compared with an increase of some $75,000,000 for the same period last year . Wail Street 4n Doubt . Great interest centres in the probable market movements of the next two or three days . The bull market really started with the election of President Coolidge last year , and prices of stocks have advanced almost perpendicularly since that time , with an intermittent period of dullness during the late Summer . Wall Street now wonders whether the " bull market " is over , or whether this is merely a drastic reaction such as usually occurs when market 's work themselves into an unhealthy technical position .
