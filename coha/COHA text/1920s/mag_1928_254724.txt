President Coolidge spent the last afternoon of 1927 assembling facts and ideas , and words and phrases to express them , for the Pan-American Congress in Havana , whither the officers and crew of the battleship Texas expect to ferry him from Key West , Fla. , next week . <P> When 1927 had but a few minutes to live , some buglers were stationed on the White House roof under a spotlight . Holding their instruments at the ready , they could look down into a pool of illumination which spread out from the mansion across the lawn to the iron fence and sidewalk . In the pool swam thousands of white ovals with dark spots on them-Washingtonian faces waiting to " see " an annual phenomenon . As 1927 expired , the buglers played " Taps , " switching into " Reveille " on the stroke of midnight . Then a band played " Your Land and My Land . " The crowd sang , cheered , tooted horns , went home . . . . This program had been arranged by Mrs. Coolidge , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , societies and the body public trooped 3,291 strong into the White House for the annual New Year Reception . <P> The bill by Senator Walsh of Montana re-amending the statute of limitations to its pre-War form , providing legal immunity for a conspiracy more than three years old , designed to force reluctant testimony in the Fall-Sinclair oil trials , received the President 's signature . <P> " MEXICAN VICE RESORTS APPEAL TO COOLIDGE TO STOP RINGING CURFEW AND KEEP OPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT . " So headlined a Scripps-Howard newspaper . The gist of the matter was that Representative Philip David Swing of California had petitioned the State and Treasury Departments to close the California-Mexico border at 6 p.m. daily . Businessmen in Tijuana and other Mexican towns hoped to invoke the spirit of Lindbergh to keep their best customers from being locked out in the evenings . President Coolidge , with many a more vital Mexican matter on his mind ( see p. 9 ) , made no statement on " vice resorts " or " curfews . " <P> An exchange of letters between Secretary Mellon and Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy had altered through force of circumstance . President Coolidge explained that such was not the case ( see p. 9 ) . <P> Outclassing all other White House callers of the week in point of ceremony was Halvard Huntfeldt Bachke , Norway 's new Minister to the U. S. , who came bearing letters of credence .
