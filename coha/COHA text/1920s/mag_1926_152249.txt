The most significant financial incident last week was the quiet withdrawal of the $100,000,000 bankers ' loan to Italy . J. P. Morgan &; Co. last fall headed a syndicate of 1,000 banks to float this loan , which was made immediately upon the arrangement of the Italian debt settlement . Enthusiasts oversubscribed the bonds at 94% , but their subsequent sale has been most lethargic . Last week the bankers withdrew their support , and the quotations dropped at once to around 89 with very little turnover . <P> The significance lies , not especially in a general distrust of European government bonds , but rather in the spreading reluctance of chattel and security holders against expanding their credit obligations . In accordance with this picture , loans and discounts of Federal Reserve member banks continued to decline .
