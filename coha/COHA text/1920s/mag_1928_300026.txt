" What Devil is riding Briand ? " <P> " Double Faced Briand shows his true /ace . " <P> " A knife in Germany 's back from Briand . " <P> " Evil Briand " <P> These comments , and others like them , sizzled from the sanctums of foremost Berlin editors , last week-even from such editors as urbane Georg Bernhard* and mild Henrich Rippler. . . . + <P> The rest of the Teuton press simply bellowed SCHWEINEHUND ! ! at M. Aristide Briand , French Foreign Minister , old , baggy-trousered , shaggy-headed , and perhaps Europe 's smartest statesman . <P> What may someday be remembered as " Briand 's Schweinehund Speech " was delivered last week before the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva . The presence of the Assembly was immaterial . Briand was talking straight to World Public Opinion , defending himself , France and the Allies , thrusting hard at a certain German and at Germany . <P> Mullet 's Barbs . The certain German is Hermann Muller , Chancellor of the German Reich . Last fortnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 ) , and thrust three barbs . <P> Barb One : Germany is now disarmed . <P> Therefore , contended Herr Mller , the Allies are morally obligated to disarm , too . But they are not disarming . <P> Barb Two : Germany is scrupulously fulfilling her Versailles Treaty obligations . Therefore , reminded Herr Mller , the Allies are reciprocally obligated ( by a clause in the Treaty ) to reward German good behavior with some such concession as early evacuation of the Rhineland . <P> Barb Three : Herr Mller implied that M. Briand is a hyprocrite , just talks peace , disarmament , etc. , etc. , etc . <P> Briand 's Thrusts . Never before has Peace Apostle Aristide Briand addressed the League in such militant , 100% French fashion as last week . Usually he exhales the grand hymn of International Concord . Last week he snapped like an angry Frenchman at enemy Germans : " It is very easy to make fine speeches about peace , and I know I have been reproached by my political enemies for producing words instead of deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these reproachers . His speech was very eloquent . Still I could not help feeling that some such reproach underlay it . <P> " We have been asked why , seeing that Germany is disarmed , all other countries are armed , especially France . But Germany is not completely disarmed. ** She has 100,000 men , and what men ! Fine men-officers and non-commissioned officers-and behind them enormous numbers who have shown in the late War what heroes they were . You can not say that if another call to arms sounded they would not , for eight or ten years at least , be ready to come forward and fight . " <P> So much for Germany 's potential might . Next M. Briand implied that the Reich has a still mightier potential ally , Soviet Russia . Of the reds M. Briand said with heavy innuendo :
