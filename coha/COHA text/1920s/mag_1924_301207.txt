Certain parts of the U. S. have a high incidence of goitre . Dr. H. H. Skinner of Yakima , Wash. , one of the districts with an extremely large proportion of goitres , noted that little had been said relative to babies born with goitre . In his own practice during one year , twelve babies were born with this condition . The goitre of the child is apparently caused by a deficiency of iodin in the diet of the mother . It may be prevented by giving the pregnant woman small doses of iodin regularly during the prenatal period .
