BRYAN-THE GREAT COMMONER-J . C. Long-Appleton ( $3.50 ) . <P> The Man . " A cross between St. George and Don Quixote " - one might add P. Y. Barnum to Author Long 's analysis , and so justify Asquith in diagnosing Bryan as " a peculiar product of your country . " If by peculiar he meant curious , there are those in this country who would agree ; if , which is more likely , he meant typical , there are those who would cavil . Not so Author Long , who writes a sympathetic though by no means fanatic account of the loves and hates , works and troubles , of the peculiar product . <P> Bryan moved from Illinois to Nebraska intending to practice law and steer clear of politics , but " he could no more keep out of politics than the Old Soak could pass the swinging door . " Elected to Congress at the age of 30 , he was immediately conspicuous for his violent eloquence . Six years later ( 1896 ) he , a shrewd politician , achieved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he canonized free silver . <P> Such was the fame of his eloquence that he gave up the law for the bigger Chatau-qua money . Incessantly he spoke on the small tradesman and farmer , and wrote about them in The Commoner , weekly journal of one man 's opinion , which endured through 22 years in spite of its spotty journalism and shortage of advertisements . For on principle Bryan refused to accept advertising of trust-made goods , though his sheet " reeked with patent medicine advertising . " Indifferent to his meagre advertising columns , he reveled in belaboring the Republicans for their sins , championed religious freedom ( the Dayton trial was 22 years later ) , applauded T. R. 's trustbusting , deplored his inviting Booker T. Washington to dine . <P> Bored , he traveled abroad . In England he studied oratory , and municipal ownership . In Russia he communed with Tolstoy , and also lectured the handsome young Tsar on free speech . In Japan he took a bath which fascinated a large audience . In six countries he observed government ownership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America . <P> He was a third time defeated in presidential campaign . Then turning rabidly on wetness , bulwark of the Democratic platform , he made straight the way for the 18th amendment . In 1912 he dominated yet another convention , in spite of furious yells : " I will give $25,000 to anyone who will kill him ! " , and " Why does n't somebody hang him ? " Bryan 's part in the <P> Wilson victory was rewarded with the highest Cabinet post . The reward bristled with trouble . His first struggle secured government rather than banker control of the Federal Reserve . Then , as Prince of Peace , he effected anti-war pacts with 30 nations , but his Tolstoian principles were put severely to the test by the Mexican situation , by the California-Japan dispute over property ownership , and finally by the Great War . His influence over Wilson was early supplanted by Colonel House , who pulled strings , machinated quietly , buzzed around in one department after the other . <P> When the administration failed to deal as severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine violations , Bryan resigned his post .
