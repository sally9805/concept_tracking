The business of advertising is to define appetites and to encourage their satisfaction . Hence it is reasonable to suppose that when advertising men hold a convention they will be sensitive to the wants of their delegates and quick to supply them . They will be , one should suppose , gay and business-like at the same time : " nothing too much ' will be their motto and tired of the exaggerations which it is sometimes their business to invent , they will be happy in normal fashion , without drums and songs and blatant rallies . <P> Delegates to the 24th annual convention and first international exposition of the International Advertising Association were met , upon their arrival in Detroit last week , by twelve beautiful girls , known as " The Fisher Body Girls . " These presented the publicists with keys . The city of Detroit , close to Canada , had taken steps to provide in every way for the comfort and convenience of its visitors. * On the first day of the convention the delegates visited " Cranbrook , " the manorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sweltering heat , they admired the cool lawns , the shade under the trees , the pellucid depths of a large swimming pool . On the next evening , as guests of the Detroit Free Press , News &; Times , the advertising men enjoyed an almost miraculous party . <P> When they were not having fun , the delegates to the convention were indulging in busy conclaves . Steelmen , druggists , Zionists and Rotarians , when they hold such sessions , are prone to be strident in praise of themselves , their ideals , the progress they have made and their importance to the well-being of the world at large . Not so advertising men . Since their business is that of horn-blowing and drumbeating , they prefer not to roll their own . R. H. Grant , vice president of Chevrolet Motor Car Co. , accused them of doing so , asserting that " the advertising man " too often annoys the world by the share he claims in the success of various businesses . This incrimination was received with applause by the humble and clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the convention held its sessions , the exposition was placed on the ground floor . Here could be seen , in 300 booths , the result of the enterprise of 225 individual exhibitors . Newssheets , manufacturers , magazines , cinema companies , mechanical contrivances were brought to the attention of the advertising men . Upstairs the convention functioned , deciding among other things , that despite the advantages of radio advertising , newspaper and magazines were still the best mediums for comprehensive campaigns ; next to newspapers , magazines . On the last day of their convention , they selected Minneapolis , after many words in favor of Berlin , as the scene of next year 's convention ; and they unanimously elected Charles Clark Younggreen , vice president &; general manager of the Milwaukee advertising firm of **35;12670;TOOLONG , Inc. , as president of the International Advertising Association . <P> Charles Clark Younggreen is 37 , stocky , with the beginning of a paunch , affable , shrewd ; he is ready to talk about anything , but whatever he talks about he is talking business .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
