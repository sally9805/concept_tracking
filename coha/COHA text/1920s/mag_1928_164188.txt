The Metropolitan Opera Company enjoys many unique advantages , none more noticeable than the prestige and humility which greets every pronouncement made by its Giulio Gatti-Casazza . Last week he announced plans for the coming year . There would be several premieres including : Strauss 's already famous Die Aegyptische Helena , in German , with presumably Rethberg or Jeritza , both of whom have sung the role in Europe , singing Helen ; Fra Gherardo , Ildebrando Pizzetti 's new opera which was sung for the first time a month ago in Milan ; and Jonny Spielt Auf , by Ernst Krenek , which is called a " jazz " opera , by Europeans who use the word to describe anything peculiarly modern or bizarre , rather than to indicate with idiomatic precision a certain distribution of rhythm in music . <P> The roster of re-engaged singers attracted , as usual , tremulous attention . It listed 34 sopranos , 12 mezzo-sopranos and contraltos , 16 tenors , 15 baritones , 14 bassos and five conductors . With less important names deleted , the roster reads as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Lucrezia Bori Grace Moore <P> Florence Easton Nina Morgana <P> Editha Fleischer Maria Mueller <P> Amelita Galli-Curci Rosa Ponselle <P> Nanette Guilford Elizabeth Rethberg <P> Maria Jeritza Marie Sundelius <P> Gertrude Kappel Marion Talley <P> Mary Lewis Marie Tiffany <P> Mezzo-Sopranos and Contraltos <P> Louise Homer Ernestine Schumann-Heink Margarete Matzenauer Henriette Wakefield <P> Tenors <P> Angelo Bada Giacomo Lauri-Volpi <P> Max Bloch Giovanni Martinelli <P> Rafaelo Diaz Lauritz Melchoir <P> Beniamino Gigli Alfio Tedesco <P> Edward Johnson Armand Tokatyan <P> Walter Kirchoff <P> Baritones <P> Louis D'Angelo Antonio Scotti <P> Giuseppe Danise Lawrence Tibbet <P> Giuseppe De Luca Clarence Whitehill <P> Titta Ruffo <P> Bassos <P> Michael Bohnen Pompilio Malatesta <P> Feodor Chaliapin Leon Rothier <P> Adamo Didur James Wolfe <P> Conductors <P> Giuseppe Bamboschek Louis Hasselmans Vincenzo Bellezza Tullio Serafin Artur Bodanzky <P> Six new voices will be added to the Metropolitan 's census . It was interesting to speculate upon which one of these the fierce light of publicity would beat , during the white winter , causing utterances like the " divine spark " speech of Grace Moore , and bringing from far haunts rude , related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marek Windheim was not in line for these honors : had he been a soprano even , he would still have been a Pole and the Poles are too remote for human interest stories . Aida Doninelli , a Central American diva , would be likewise unsatisfactory . Grace Divine and Pearl Besuner ( a tobacconist 's daughter ) , are , by a lamentable coincidence , citizens of the same city , Cincinnati . Both have recently won fellowships in Dresden and refused them for Metropolitan premieres whose sameness must in some measure darken whatever advertising glory they might otherwise have possessed . Clara Jacobo owes her upbringing to Lawrence , Mass. , a small town ; she is the daughter of a humble merchant ; she has already sung in choirs and with the San Carlo Company . There is no reason why she should not be well touted .
