" All the sins I have committed in this life and previous lives are now destroyed as I walk step by step around this sacred fire . " <P> So said , last week , famed Miss Nancy Ann Miller of Seattle , as she proceeded to embrace Hinduism , in order to become the third wife of the abdicated Maharaja of Indore , Sir Tukoji Rao Holkar ( TIME , March 8 , 1926 ) . <P> Slowly she paced around a fire blazing upon the bank of the esteemed Godavari River , at Gangapur , India . Priests invoked in her behalf the whole pantheon of Hindu deities . At the conclusion of the ceremony she approached the potent High Priest Jagadgur Shankarcharva , touched his feet , received his blessing , and walked away no longer Nancy Ann Miller but the Hindu Maiden Devi Sharmista . <P> Interviewed she said : " My new name was that of an Indian Queen born centuries before Christ . ... I am now a Hindu , but I hope that the true spirit of Christianity will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maiden Devi Sharmista journeyed to Barwaha , a seat of the semi-royal family of her fiance . There she was welcomed by a retinue of swarthy nobles riding upon elephants . Deep and throbbing came the pulse of heavy drums . <P> No less than 17 separate rituals were required to transform the Maiden into a Maharani ( courtesy title ) . The first ceremonies admitted her to Sir Tukoji 's caste , and made her the adopted daughter of his potent kinswoman , the Princess Tara-bai . With her social status thus assured , she became by a second adoption the daughter of a Court functionary , Colonel Lam Bhate , whose duty it became to give her in marriage . <P> The wedding rites now rapidly ensued , and Colonel Lam Bhate explicitly declared : " For the God of Love , for Wealth , and for the Blessing of Procreation , to you I offer Devi Sharmista . " When news of these words reached the bride 's grandfather , Mr. Louis Schaefer , in Seattle , he exclaimed : " I 'm sorry I was n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman 's job . " <P> Meanwhile , at Barwaha , the nuptials had been completed by the ceremony of withdrawing a veil from between the lovers , a fire ceremony , and a rite which consisted in winding around the bodies of the bride and bridegroom a single symbolic , yellow cord . Lastly , the wedded couple descended from their marriage pavilion into the open and called to witness that they are man and wife some 500 wedding guests and the Stars , Moon and Sun .
