( See front cover ) <P> Long before the first golden-rod grows bright in far away fields , the yellow lights of the new season are raised above Broadway . By September , usually , the first hit has arrived in town ; the streets off Times Square are crammed with stage folk who hope this winter not to play Des Moines ; the dramatic critics , yellow and sick from uncustomary contact with the sun , are once more being kittenish on the keys . At the centre of all this glittering activity are the producers ; it depends upon them whether the new year shall be tawdry or delightful . <P> There are in New York only about a dozen really important producers . Their names remain fixed while those of actors shine and grow dark . David Belasco , Lee Shubert and his brother Jake , Sam Harris , " Ziggy , " the Selwyns , George M. Cohan , Winthrop Ames , William A. Brady , A. H. Woods , George White , Dillingham-everyone who sees plays or reads about them has heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-line producers . Younger than the rest but equally successful , he took it easy last week while others were in a ferment of excitement , getting their new offerings ready for the stage . Having already supplied Broadway with the first success of the season , The Front Page , he stated erroneously that he was through producing plays , went to the country , and contemplated not the future but the past . <P> His past , as such , was pleasant . Jed Harris , n Jacob Horowitz , could not remember when his family came from Vienna to live in Newark , N. J. But he could remember living there , in a small and hideous house , and going to high school to get ready for college . Of Yale , too , he had pleasant memories . Not the nostalgic memories of a college hero but the more delicious , spiteful recollection of unpopularity among those whom he has since surpassed . At Yale , Jake Horowitz was not the type . After two years , he left Yale and went to Europe . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sending money from the U. S. to certain states in the interior of Europe . To insure safety , people who wanted to do so entrusted their currency to travelers rather than the mails . Jake Horowitz got the notion that it might be profitable to act as a paid courier for this purpose and set out , with several companions , to do so . By the time the party reached Paris , they were broke . When they drew lots to see which one should stay in Paris instead of going further , Horowitz got the short straw . Paris , he knew , was no place for a Yale French scholar to live in , so he went to London and stayed there among the chop suey dishes and Chinese laundries of the Limehouse district . When he came back to the U. S. , he was a stowaway in the stoker 's forecastle of a tramp ship .
