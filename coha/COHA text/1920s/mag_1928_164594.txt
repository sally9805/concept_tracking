Sirs : <P> If the Republicans have Onward Christian Soldiers for their campaign song , as Mr. Fort says TIME , July 9 , I shall lose my last vestige of hesitancy and vote against Herbert Hoover the Quaker and for Governor Smith the Roman Catholic . Perhaps in the Quaker Church , with its lack of ritual , there is inculcated a disdain for the ritual of others . Brought up in the worship of silence , Mr. Hoover will not mind making a fine old hymn of our fathers into a catch-tune of the hustings . I have been a Republican , if that is what it is to vote for Taft , Hughes , Harding and Coolidge , but I am observant and , I hope reverent . Politics is a trade and a business nowadays . There is no place in it now for holy hymns . My promise to vote for Smith should reassure you that I am not fanatical about the separation of church and state . My protest is simply against what seems to me a particularly crass bit of blasphemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " indeed ! Faugh ! <P> <P> MEREDITH WIGTON <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> Hoover Wedding <P> Sirs : <P> Because I want accurate , authoritative information I am referring my query to you ... <P> Some time ago ( perhaps in TIME ) I read that Herbert Hoover and Lou Henry were married in California by a Catholic priest . This ordinarily means that one or both of the contracting parties profess the Catholic faith . Is it possible to obtain exact information as to the time , place , name of Church and name of priest performing the ceremony ? <P> <P> MRS . WILLIAM G. BARRY <P> Subscriber <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> <P> Herbert Clark Hoover and Lou Henry were married in January , 1899 , in the Henry house at Monterey , Calif. , by Father Ramon Mestrec , a Roman Catholic missionary priest with a dispensation permitting him to perform a civil wedding ceremony for non-Catholics. - ED . <P> <P> Hoover Drinks ? Sirs : <P> <P> Now that you have told us just how wet Al Smith is , let us hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to Borah 's questionnaire there seems to be a groping for vagueness . I wonder if Hoover has always held to the teachings of his Quaker fathers ' during all these years with the British . <P> <P> J. M. BENSON <P> Jefferson , Ohio . <P> <P> Following Secretary Hoover 's answer to the Borah questionnaire , Lawyer Clarence Darrow said : " I do n't think Hoover is any drier than I am . I ought to know . I have had a drink with him " ( TIME , March 5 ) . Last week , questions were submitted asking Nominee Hoover to confirm or deny the Darrow statement and also to record : 1 ) whether Mr. Hoover has taken a drink since Prohibition ; 2 ) whether Mr. Hoover would take a drink now if assured the liquor was legally possessed . Nominee Hoover 's secretary , chubby George Akerson , refused to transmit the questions to his chief . Vexed , he cried : " A lot of foolish nonsense !
