txt In a talk with Mr. Harrimant he once spoke to me of the lack of personal touch in modern business . Said he , " Formerly , at the mill , or in the store , they were working for the old man . Benny Altman , for instance , used to know every girl in his employ . He used to move among them every day , evidencing an interest in every one . It was the same with Ogden Armour , and many another . The old man knew everybody and they in turn : looked to him as to a father . With such a family feeling , ' they would not think of calling a strike . " Now , with great corporations , it is quite different . The personal touch is gone , and with it that former unity that bound the old man to his workers . That personal touch is what we 're needing now .

Last year , 1 visited a steel plant at North Tonawanda . The chief there was a young man who had the ideal of applying humanity to business . I had a talk with one of his superintendents , who declared , " The chief here sure is a prince . When I first got hack from the war . I was working fur another concern , the kind that treats you as if yitiu were wood or stone . Well , I might have put up with that stuff before the war , but not after . I went to the boss and told him I was through . Then . as luck would have it . I got a job here . and say , the chief here is the right kind , he 's a prince . He can get 2-1 hours ' enthusiasm out of us at any time .

A great strike once threatened the Anaconda Copper Co . To a committee . that called upon him . Marcus Daly frankly stated : " I can not accede to your demands . It would he unjust to my company , " " In that case , " replied the chairman , " we will strike . " " Very well , " was Mr. Daly 's answer , " that is your privilege . But remembfr , it will not be ' long until there will be real suffering among your men who have saved no money .

" HEART THROBS FOR CLASS AND MASS This word being reported to the miners , it was decided to call off the strike , because it would be bad business to strike against a man like Marcus Daly . We need a few more right now of the same type as Marcus Daly . Heart power , rather than head power , gives cohesion . There are cases aplenty of businesses that have fallen asunder , because the man at the head represented only cold efficiency . There must be those in command , and those under command .

With such disparity , distinctions are inevitable . These distinctions become invidious when the man on top forgets that human touch that makes the whole world kind . No organization can ignore the human element . The army is perhaps the most rigid , and yet even there is the human qualities , other things being equal , that make the best officer . I had this brought home to me in an experience with two generals . I was forward observing officer in a front line trench . Early in the morning , a Canadian brigadier , peremptorily demanded to see a cer tain target . After his request had been complied with , he grunted , and wheeled off as-if all subalterns were dogs , leaving behind a subaltern whose feelings were not warm toward brigadiers . In the afternoon , along came a corps commander . He addressed me with a deference that might have been expected toward the Prince of Wales , and after several pleasantries , inquired if he might see the target , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a smile , he vanished , leaving behind a subaltern muttering , " What splendid fellows are these generals ! " Arrogance in high places is the badge of the " cheap and nasty . " Sir Walter Scott . driving home at night , was wont to climb upon the box beside the cabby . This was the quality in Sir Walter that made him for his cabby , not merely " the mt.ster , " but " the beloved master . " In the family where Jelin Ruskin grew up , he was trained to regard the servants not as servants , but as friends . Thus Ruskin attained a kinship with Lincoln . MEN WHOM SUCCESS OBSCURES " He 's too big for the place he came from . " A certain magazine devoted to claptrap success had recently told what a wonderful fellow he was , and then that friend of boyhood , remaining on the farm , dismissed it all with that remark of tragic portent .

" He was never so far away but that he could still hear the note of the evening bird in the groves of his nativity . " Lincoln was one of those t are ones who could " talk with kings , nor lose the common touch . " That " common touch " is what we are homesick for today . It is time to challenge the selfsufficiency of those who have gotten too big for the place they came from . Void is the success of the boy from the country who can no longer take his place with the elect around the cracker-barrel in the general store . In the midst of so much machinery , it 's time to emphasize the need of that priceless element of humanity . Many a good organizaticn has gone to the devil through a mistaken idea of efficiency .

KITCHENER AND BOTHA  --  BR011'HERS At the close of the South African War , a friendly clasp on the shouldei- did more to bridge the gulf between Britain and Boer than endless argument . The peace sitting had come to a dead-lock . Lord Milner had started to dig in his heels . General Botha likewise . Neither would bulge . It looked like failure . Just then Kitchener , who realized the horror of prolonged guerilla warfare , clapped one of the Boers on the shoulder , exclaiming , " Let 's come outside for a minute , Smuts . " Outside , walking together , aria in arm , the two rival generals fixed up the peace . It was not as pompous plenipotentiaries , but as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This fact was bOrne home to me at the time of the steel strike . I went to Youngstown to inquire into the situation .

One evening I was taken by a friend to visit this union leader in his home . THE POWER OF A LITTLE CHILD I found him in the kitchen with a little baby on his knee . The other children were playing about the floor . I came to see " a dirty agitator . " I found instead , a loving-hearted father , a poor , earnest man , who was giving himself , to spend and be spent , for the cause of labor . We never discussed the issues of the strike . But when I went away , at the end of the evening , my bitterness against that union leader had vanished . Intellectually , we disagreed the same as ever .
