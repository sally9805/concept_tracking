T HE GREAT DINNER given to Owen D. Young in New York on December 11 , in recognition of his services in Europe as a member of the Dawes Commission , was a well-merited honor . Giving high praise to General Dawes for his work , which he described as the " selling end " of this business operation as opposed to the " manufacturing " in which he and the others labored , Mr. Young made no extravagant claims for the plan itself . He stated frankly that he took a middle ground as to its merits , between the extreme views in favor of or against the plan . " The members of our committee , " he said , " well knew that human minds are too small to comprehend such great forces and to make a plan which , unchanged , would be permanently effective to control them . " That is altogether refreshing . The Nation has never taken the view that the plan reduced the German people to slavery , but it has feared that it put undue burdens upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan is very much of a compromise . But it has started things going in Europe , averted bankruptcy and social disintegration , removed much ended the Franco-German deadlock , and done away ( for the time , at least ) with the threat of European war . We are profoundly indebted to Mr. Young for making it clear that the Dawes Plan can not endure unchanged . That merely adds to the debt which not only America but the world owes him . In saying that , we do not abate a jot of our belief that the worst feature of the . Dawes Plan is that it gives American financiers a domination over Europe which may have the most serious consequences . S O THE SENATE has voted the House bill appropriating $110,000,000 for the " modernization " of the navy . Congress might better throw this vast sum into the Atlantic Ocean . There it would create no while doing the country as much good as will its expenditure on the fleet . The bill now goes to Mr. Coolidge for his signature , and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say that he was for an adequate army and navy , although warning the country against listening to stories that other countries were arming against us ? Our jingoes have not listened to his admonitions . Mr. William B. Shearer , our latest " naval expert , " has solemnly and publicly warned the inimitable Solomon Stanwood Menken and his National Security League that Japan is preparing for war with us ; the Navy League has impugned the truthfulness of a statement issued by the Japanese Navy Department ; and the fleet maneuvers in Hawaii are not to be stopped although Japan is the theoretic " enemy " against whom we are to maneuver . On top of this comes this criminally wasteful and dangerous expenditure of $110,000,000 more on the navy . This will have its prompt echo in England and Japan , our only possible antagonists on the sea . If we do not have war with Japan within the next five years it will not be the fault of the preparedness advocates . They , by the way , are very indignant when peace-lovers refuse to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to flout the admonitions of the President to desist from war-creating propaganda . Loyalty to officialdom is , in their view , the duty of the other fellow . T REASON IS SPREADING so rapidly in our army and navy that we heartily wish our navy and security leagues would devote themselves to ferreting it out , leaving the condition of the navy alone  --  no two experts have ever yet agreed on that . Here is General Robert Lee Bullard , one of our three commanders of armies in France , quoted as saying that one German soldier equaled three Allied . That is going too far . Coming as it does on top of the clean bill of health which Admiral Sims gave the German submarine officers , we must ask where this will stop . What is to become of our cherished belief that the cowardly German had to be driven to the front and chained to his machine-guns , and that any American sergeant could kill twenty squareheads single-handed ? Perish the thought ! Keep all the old fictions alive , or there may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its honesty , the relative moral positions of the adversaries , the worthwhileness of its outcome . The old tone rings in the dispatches now coming out of Spain charging the Moroccans with mutilating the bodies of the Spanish prisoners and Spanish dead , with subjecting their captors to torture , with chaining them to stakes , blinding them by confinement in dungeons and starving them to death , etc. , etc . That has the familiar ring of world-war days ; that is the patriotic way to talk of one 's enemies and to keep alive the fighting qualities . Let us have lies and then again lies , for henchmen of the war-god can carry on in no other way . M R. MELLON COMES back to his muttons in his annual report : that is , the reduction of the income taxes , especially the surtaxes of the very rich , of whom he is one of the richest . Naturally he rejoices in the defeat of the La Follette forces , since they were particularly opposed to his policies and attacked him personally with a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the inheritance taxes and to abolish the gift tax which has only just been passed . With some reason he declares it to be unworkable . With his reasoning that it " handicaps business " we can not at all agree . The one object and purpose of Mr. Mellon 's official existence is to " free " business . He isnpposed to income-tax publicity because he thinks it hurts business , and to tax-exempt securities because they keep money out of business . He wants income-tax rates down because  --  according to Mr. Mellon  --  they hamper business , and when the facts go dead against him he is just a little more eager than ever to cut the rates . We wonder if he is able to sleep at all when he thinks of the perils that menace business . But we cheerfully admit that when he lies awake nights he can take solid satisfaction in the excellent work the Treasury has done under him in refunding our obligations , in helping to reduce expenses , and generally to put our public finances in order . H ULLABALOOING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political pastime in Great Britain as it has long been in the United States . Winston Churchill is now making loud noises about the impropriety of letting any of England 's debtors off . The Nation knows no good reason why France should pay her debt to the United States any sooner than she pays her prior debt to Great Britain , and if our Mr. Mellon were getting away with any such magic it might be well for England 's Mr. Churchill to stop it . Mr. Churchill , however , is not content to demand that France pay England as soon as she pays us . He wants her to pay everybody , in particular to pay England as well as England is paying us . But political speeches do not produce money where money does not exist , and some of Winston Churchill 's speeches seem more likely to dry up the sources than to increase them . An intelligent creditor naturally adjusts terms of payment in accordance with the conditions of his bankrupt debtor , and it does not help much if sound debtors cry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that France should not get better terms than England did . In fact , she will  --  because she is less able to pay . If he objects to France paying on terms which might be possible , the result will probably be to stop France paying anything at all  --  either to the United States or to Great Britain . T HAT ZINOVIEV LETTER refuses to stay out of the news . England 's Tory Government says its members have no doubt of its authenticity , but they refuse to explain the reasons for their faith . This is the famousletter , alleged to have been signed by Zinoviev , the president of the Third Internationale , and Arthur McManus , leader of the British Communists , last October , virtually appealing for armed revolution . Four days before the election it was printed in the English newspapers and it undoubtedly cost the Labor Party hundreds of thousands of votes . Ramsay MacDonald , away from London campaigning , at first accepted the word of the permanent officials of the Foreign Office that it was genuine ; he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the letter before the Government , and the British Government has admitted that it has never had in its possession , or even seen , the original of the letter . All it has ever had is an alleged photostat copy , and Mr. Austen Chamberlain has hinted in the House of Commons that he doubted the authenticity of McManus 's signature . Both McManus and Zinoviev have denounced it as a forgery . The Soviet Government has suggested reference of the question of its authenticity to neutral experts . Mr. Chamberlain replies that his mind is made up and he will do nothing more . That leaves the British Government in as cowardly a position as the French Government was in when the Dreyfus case began . T HERE IS A NEW MAGAZINE for people to buy before they board the train . But its contents will never be new . Doubtless many a commuter will glance at a cover of the Golden Book and , seeing in the usual fashion there the names of a dozen or so star contributors , never realize that most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the grave . The first number of the Golden Book , just published , contains serials by Stevenson , Gaboriau , and , Maupassant ; short stories by Tolstoi , 0 . Henry , Kipling , Bret Harte , Mark Twain , and H. C. Bunner ; a play by Anatole France ; an essay by Montaigne ; travel sketches by Sir Richard Burton and Sir Harry Johnston ; and poems by Burns , Villon , William Dunbar , Christina Rossetti , and Emily Dickinson . It is to be hoped that the commuter will read on . For he will make the acquaintance of Mark Twain 's jumping frog , of Anatole France 's man who married a dumb wife , of Bunner 's Hector , and of Gaboriau 's Lecoq , to mention no more . The experiment is a bold one , the outcome of which will be awaited with some eagerness by those who have always suspected that tons of older literature went unread because unseen . The place for a classic may be in a bound book ; yet numerous unprofessional readers do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers have to admit sometimes that they have no text of " The Notorious Jumping Frog " ? for instance  --  about them . The editors of the Golden Book are particularly to be envied , however . All of their contributions will be worth reading ; there will be no painful letters to write , and no rejection slips . E VEN THOUGH WE have not yet been included among the 500 members of the Monday Opera Club , or even among its 2,500 invited guests , we have our opinions . Alexandra Feodorovna is a grand duchess and the sister of a queen and the wife of a pretender , and she doubtless exudes the dignity and good breeding which New York society intends to import from Europe . For aught we care she may rejoice in all the presidential suites and special trains that society ladies wish to engage for her . All we object to is the philosophy lurking behind this expensive importation . The committee of the Monday Opera Club has this to say : If dignity and good breeding are not restored " there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So the grand duchess was invited to come to America . Now there are two things at least which help revolutions along : the flaunting of social differences by pretentiousness and pomp and the intriguing of discredited royalist ? migr  --  s . The husband of this grand duchess thinks he is the Czar of Russia , and since Russia inconveniently thinks otherwise he has set up a little private Russian court in Coburg . But even Bavaria doubts if the Grand Duke Cyril 's court should be maintained in a country at friendly peace with Russia and may ask him to move to more monarchical shores  --  perhaps the United States . At a New York reception to the grand duchess the other day Russian royalists knelt at her feet and Boris Brasol hailed her as the Czarina . If we were worried lest a French or a Russian revolution were lurking under the plush sofas of New York society , we would not seek to avert it by hiring an unemployed Russian grand duchess . H AS THE PRACTICAL JOKE passed from the American scene ? Regretfully we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of humor still survives , at least in such parts of the country as have not been too much disturbed by progress . But in our cities public opinion and the police have pretty nearly done it to death . New York City has just lost its last notable practical joker at the age of seventy-five , and we do not look to see him replaced . Some of the pranks of Brian G. Hughes were simple horse-play , as when he put up signs on his land : " Not for Sale , B. G. Hughes , America , " or when he set all Asbury Park to digging in the sand by pretending to have found $50,000 . At other times he came close to satire , as when he " dolled up " an alley cat purchased for ten cents , hired a uniformed valet to attend it , and won a blue ribbon at a cat show . Later he just missed doing as well with a worn-out street-car nag which he entered in the horse show . The practical joke is part of the individualistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an era when our humor was amateur  --  when everyone rolled his own or his neighbor beat him to it . It dies of loneliness or fright as our fun-making and humor are professionalized and syndicated . W HEN A WOMAN decides to keep her name after marriage she is frequently criticized for making so much ado about nothing ; but when she seeks later to obtain a passport under her own name , or open an account in a conservative bank , or draw her pay from a government job , her name suddenly becomes of the utmost importance to all the authorities ; the State Department refuses her a passport , the president of the bank will not honor her signature , the government department will not make out a check to so misguided and miscalled a female . Precedent has been upset , however , in the case of Miss Helena Normanton , English barrister , who was admitted as a member of the Middle Temple in 1919 , a few hours after the enactment of the Sex Disqualification Removal Act . She was married in 1921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , a year later , she was called to the bar , bitter opposition arose among serious legal authorities . The Joint Council of the Four Inns of Court solemnly sat upon the question for eight months or so and finally decided that Miss Normanton had a right to use her own name if she , chose . Last September she applied , under her hard-won name , to the British Foreign Office for a passport . It was refused on grounds of public policy . She submitted a brief citing the arguments and precedents that had convinced the jurists of the Inns of Court . The Foreign Office considered the evidence and granted the passport . This will not , of course , alter the attitude of the American State Department which has refused passports in like cases , apparently for reasons of tender sentiment without reference to any law . But American precedent has been broken none the less , for the American consul in London has given Miss Normanton a visa and thus has planted the seal of the State Department of the United States on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATRICK SWEENEY , cut down in his early thirties , had all the Irishman 's love of a good time , zest for a fight , and capacity for spending himself without measure in a cause in which his heart was enlisted .

He had many adversaries but few enemies . When this country entered the World War Mr. Sweeney left the Philadelphia Public Ledger and was attached first to the Committee on Public Information and then to the War Labor Board . Later he investigated working-class education in Europe for the Department of Labor . Upon his return to the United States he did publicity work for the Irish Republic and Farmer-Labor Party , and put before the country the report of twelve distinguished lawyers condemning Attorney General Palmer 's illegal drive against radicals ; in 1921 he went to the New York World , where he did notable work in the exposure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent and valued contributor to the columns of The Nation , and in his death the liberal cause loses a valiant and lovable champion . M USSOLINI AND KING GEORGE have this in common : they both collect stamps . King George is known to have one of the finest stamp collections in the world , and Mussolini must be a philatelist , else why should he have made his name so beloved to the stamp fanatic ? When Italian troops landed in Corfu Mussolini rushed to order new postage stamps . The fact that his troops were out of Corfu before the stamps were off the printing-presses did not disturb him ; collectors bought the stamps just as eagerly . Now he has a new trick . Instead of advertising , military training camps in the cancelations , as is the wont of the peace-loving American post-office department , Mussolini has cannily enlarged the size of his stamps and taken to selling advertising space on them . The Italian fiftycentesimi stamps now cross the water with all sorts of gay additions to the sober face of Victor Emmanuel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratis , " say some of them in easily translatable Italian ; and another advertises a white-goods sale in Rome . If only King George had equal dictatorial powers what a boon he might be to his subjects  --  they must grow weary of his somber Windsor visage repeated eternally on stamps of every denomination .
