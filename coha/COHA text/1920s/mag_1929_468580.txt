IN 1841 , the editor of The Daily Aurora of New York City was a rather debonair young man from Brooklyn , a Mr. Walter Whitman , twenty-two years old , who " usually wore a frock coat and a high hat , carried a small cane " and had " the lapel of his coat almost invariably ornamented with a boutonniere . " A contemporary de ? scribed him as " tall and graceful in appearance , neat in attire , and possessed of a very pleasing and impressive eye and a cheerful and happy-looking coun ? tenance . " It is also recorded that he was a success with the blue-stockings of the day . " I have been with him often in the society of ladies , " a friend wrote , " and I never knew of any woman young or old but thought him a most agreeable gentleman of great culture . " It was a brave day for blue-stockings and gentlemen of great culture . A diarist of the time observes , " Walked down Broadway with all the fashion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a blue satin cloak and a white muslin dress . I looked to see if she had on blue stock ? ings , but I think not . I suspect that her stockings were pink , and she wore low slippers . They say that she dreams in Italian and quotes French verses . " She was the same age as the editor of The Daily Aurora , having been born , like him , in May , 1819 . And walking down Broadway , " with all the fashion , " she may have seen him ? tall and grace ? ful , in his high hat and his frock coat , swinging his small cane ? since he prome ? naded on Broadway , in those days , as devotedly as Thoreau roamed his woods . He was more professional in literature than she ; he was trying to make his living by writing , and she did not need to ; but they both produced the same kind of verse ? the kind that was fashion ? able in the literary journals of the moment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous hall of pride , Where tears fall thick and loved ones sigh , Wished he , when the dark hour approach 'd , To drop his veil of flesh and die . In spite of his buttonhole bouquet and his high hat , he really much preferred to end Amid the thunder-clash of strife , Where hovers War 's ensanguined cloud , And bright swords flash and banners fly Above the wounds and groans and blood . As elegant sad verse , this would seem to compare favorably with Julia Ward 's stanza from her poem " On Looking Over a Diary Kept While I Was Under Serious Impressions " : Oh ! Happy days , gone , never to return , At which fond memory will ever burn , Ohl Joyous hours , with peace and gladness blest , When hope and joy dwelt in this careworn breast . which she had written , seven years before , at the careworn age of fifteen . Although they were both made famous , twenty years later , by their poems about the Civil War ? he by his " 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Battle Hymn of the Republic " ? I do not know of any record that they ever met . Cer ? tainly not in the 1840 's . They were worlds apart socially . As the daughter of Mr. Samuel Ward , the rich New York banker , she was " a frequenter of fashion ? able society , " to quote her own subse ? quent description of herself , " a musical amateur , a dilettante in literature . " He , in spite of his fashionable appear ? ance , was the son of a Long Island farmer-carpenter , and he had worked his way up to the office of The Daily Aurora as a lawyer 's errand boy , a doctor 's office boy , a typesetter , and a country school-teacher . He had a rather meager education , and if any lady mistook him for " a gentleman of great culture " she must have been hypnotized by his pleasing and impressive eye . In the 1860 's and 70 's he could still write to his mother , from Washington , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I was very sorry you was n't able to come on to see the Review . " All he had of the fashionable gentle ? man were the clothes and the taste for idleness . The proprietor of the Aurora thought him " the laziest fellow who ever undertook to edit a city paper . " It was his habit to arrive at his office " between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morn ? ing , " according to one of his editorial associates , and after looking over " the daily and exchange papers , " he always strolled down Broadway to the Battery , spent " an hour or two amid the trees , enjoying the water view , " and returned " to the office location at about two or three o'clock in the afternoon . " Ap ? parently , these leisurely habits lost him his position on the Aurora , and he be ? came what is called a free-lance . As a free-lance , he wrote a quantity of verse and prose that was mostly worse than mediocre . The prose espe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the faintest glint of artistic conscience , and faked in imita ? tion chiefly of Edgar Allan Poe and James Fenimore Cooper . In November , 1842 , he put out an anonymous novel , Franklin Evans ; ur The Inebriate , dedi ? cated to the Temperance Societies of the day . It was published in a weeklystory paper called The New World , and ballyhooed as written " expressly for The New World by one of the best novelists in this country , with a view to aid the great work of reform and rescue young men from the demon of Intem ? perance . " It was really written , one of his friends records , " mostly in the read ? ing room of Tammany Hall , which was a sort of Bohemian resort , and he after ? wards told me that he frequently in ? dulged in gin cocktails , while writing it , at the ' Pewter Mug , ' another resort fur Bohemians around the corner in Spruce Street . " Copies of Franklin Evans are now so extremely rare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his biographers upon it as " chaotic , " " ill-. told , " " rambling , " and " difficult to treat seriously . " But much of his other free-lance work of the period has been collected and reprinted , and most of it deserves the epithets that have been used on Franklin Evans . Among these fugitive pieces is an article called " Rich ? ard Parker 's Widow " from a monthly magazine , The Arislidean , published in New York in 1845 . It begins , " When I was in London some years since , " and it describes how Whitman saw the widow of Richard Parker , a once famous mutineer , applying for " parish assist ? ance " from a " magistrate " in a " police office . " A friend , he says , pointed her out to him secretly and then " went on to give MC the particulars of this cele ? brated mutiny . " Whitman , of course , was never in London , and the story of the mutiny , as he tells it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Crime or The New Newgate Calendar ( London , 1841 ) . The only considerable change that he makes in Pelham 's narrative is this : according to Pelham , the convicted mutineer , before he was hanged at the yard-arm , was given a glass of white wine which he drank " to the salvation of his soul and the forgive ? ness of all his enemies " ; Whitman makes it " a glass of water . " The Aristidean printed also , in March 1845 , a long story by Walter Whitman , called " The Arrow-Tip " ; and Whitman subsequently reprinted it anonymously as " The Half-Breed , " an " original novelette by a Brooklynite , " in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle , June 1846 , when he was editing that newspaper . In spite of his apparent pride in the story , it is as dull and pretentious an imitation of Fenimore Cooper as any high-school boy ever wrote . It may have been founded on some true anecdote which Whitman had heard , but there is scarcely an incident in it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any life . The plot is awkward and improbable . There is not an accent of sincerity in any line of it ? from the " merry peals of laughter " among the " young elves " of school-children in the opening paragraph , down to the closing sentences in which one of the children ( after the tragedy of the story has been concluded ) becomes a " young political aspirant " for " a respectable legislative office " ? quite irrelevantly and patheti ? cally . I doubt whether anyone can read these magazine contributions by Walter Whit ? man without concluding that he was not only a lazy young man but a stupid and insincere one . Here is a specimen of his writing when he is imitating Fenimore Cooper : Just out from the village when the hunting party started that morning , they had been joined by Arrow-Tip 's brother , the Deer . He , accompanied by a favorite dog , was watching the evolutions of a large bird that lazily skimmed near the surface of a cascade near by ? a charming spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , would be visited by thousands for its beauty . " Call the dog from me , brother , " said the Deer , " he frightens the bird . " Arrow-Tip did as he was desired . The party had passed on , bidding the two Indians to follow . And the chief sat himself down a moment , at the foot of a large tree , and waited till the successful aim of the Deer should bring the bird to the ground . One hand grasped his hunting-bow , and with the other he caressed the dug . The plot of the narrative makes it preferable not to detail minutely here all theevents that took place during the day . One of these events ? a startling and bloody one ? has already been intimated to the reader , at the conclusion of the last chapter . And here is a paragraph when he is imitating Poe : And there is one , childlike , with helpless and unsteady movements , but a countenance of immortal bloom , whose long-lashed eyes droop downward . The name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels are silent , and gaze upon him with pity and affection . And the fair eyes of the Shape roll , but fix upon no object ; while his lips move , but in a plaintive tone only is heard the speaking of a single name . Wandering in the confines of earth , or restlessly amid the streets of the beautiful land , goes Dai , earnestly calling on one he loves . Wherefore is there no response ? Although his more enthusiastic biog ? raphers exult that his contributions were printed in the same literary journals as the work of Hawthorne , Bryant , Long ? fellow , Lowell , Thoreau , Whittier , and Poe , it must be credited to the good taste of the magazine editors and readers of the period that Walter Whitman failed as a free-lance and returned to newspaper work . In 1846 , he was edit ? ing the Brooklyn Eagle . A number of his editorials are given in Emory Hol ? loway 's Whitman , and they deserve Bliss Perry 's complaint , in his life of Whitman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without dis ? tinction . " In 1848 , having lost his place on the Eagle , he was offered , as he says , " a good chance to go down to New Orleans on the staff of the Crescent , a. daily to be started there with plenty of capital behind it , in opposition to the Picayune . " He went to the Crescent and worked for it for three months . Holloway reprints several of his " easy ? going , whimsical , sometimes puerile sketches " from the Crescent and con ? cludes that he lost his position " pos ? sibly " because the proprietors saw " that his slovenly writing . . . would add distinction to no paper . " When he returned to Brooklyn he founded a free-soil journal , The Brooklyn Daily Freeman , and earned this con ? temporary notice : " Mr. Whitman is an ardent politician of the radical demo ? cratic school , and lately established the Daily Freeman in Brooklyn , to promul ? gate his favorite ' Free Soil ' and other reformatory doctrines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so ended his career as a newspaper man , for the time . In 1850 , he wrote some articles anonymously for the New York Advertiser and the Evening Post , but they were chiefly critical articles on art and music . " I guess it was about those years , " says his brother George , " he had an idea he could lecture . He wrote what mother calls barrels of lectures . We did not know what he was writing . He did not seem more abstracted than usual . He would lie abed late , and after getting up would write a few hours if he took the notion ? perhaps would go off the rest of the day . We were all at work ? all except Walt . " Only one of these lectures seems to have been delivered ? a lecture before the art students of the Brooklyn Art Union , March 31 , 1851 . In his first paragraph , Walter Whitman turned his back on much of his past . " Among such a people as the Americans , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pecuniary profit ? more for acquiring than enjoying or well developing what they acquire ? ambitious of the physical rather than the intellectual ; a race to whom matter-of-fact is everything and the ideal nothing ? a nation of whom the steam-engine is no bad symbol ? he does a good work who , pausing in the way , calls to the feverish crowd that in the life we live upon this beautiful earth there may after all be something vaster and better than dress and the table , business and politics . " To utter this call was " the glorious province of arts and of all artists worthy of the name . " As an aesthete , contemptuous of dress and the table and business and politics , he reprobated the clothes of " fashionable tailordom " ? the clothes which he had worn as editor of The Aurora ? and especially " the fashionable hat , before which language has nothing to say because sight is the only thing that can begin to do it justice . " And with characteristic sincerity , he included in his lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the death-bed of Rousseau quite unwarranted by any historical evidence . " He had given up the costume of the Aurora editor and also the " neat frock coat " which he had worn as a school ? teacher . He had become progressively Bohemian in his attire as a free-lance writer . Now , suddenly , he began to dress in the rough clothes of a working ? man , belted trousers , a shirt open at the neck to show his undershirt , high boots , and a soft felt hat . He had decided to become the Walt Whitman of the Leaves of Grass , and he went to work for his father , the carpenter , while he wrote his book . if anyone doubts that this " Walt Whitman " was only a new alias for the Walter Whitman of Franklin Evans and the imitations of Poe and Cooper , I recommend him to read the anonymous reviews which Walter Whitman wrote of Walt Whitman 's poems . One of the earliest of the series appeared in the Brooklyn Times , Sept. 29 , 1855 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of Leaves of Grass . He introduces himself , " Very devilish to some , and very divine to some , will appear the poet of these new poems , the Leaves of Grass ; an attempt , as they are , of a na ? ve , masculine , affectionate , contemplative , sensual , imperious per ? son , to east into literature not only his own grit and arrogance , but his own flesh and form , undraped , regardless of models , regardless of modesty or law , and ignorant or silently scornful , as at first appears , of all except his own pres ? ence and experience , and all outside the fiercely loved land of his birth , and the birth of his parents , and their parents for several generations before him . " Can anybody imagine that the Walter Whitman who wrote that sentence was really the na ? ve , masculine , sensual , im ? perious , undraped , arrogant , and silent ? ly scornful person which Walt Whitman pretended to be ? Is it possible that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his birth , and the birth of his parents , and their parents for several generations before him " arose out of a true patriotism and not out of a blurb-writer 's desire to sell his volume to the hundred-per-centers of his day ? Could Walter Whitman have been unaware of the sexual exhibitionism in his poems when he came out before his literary side-show to promise that if you paid the entrance fee you would see Walt Whitman , on the inside , " undraped , " in " his own flesh and form , " " regardless of modesty or law " ? Or consider the following sentence : " Of pure American breed , large and lusty ? age thirty-six years ? never once using medicine never dressed in black , always dressed freshly and clean in strong clothes ? neck open , shirt-collar flat and broad , countenance tawny transparent red , beard well-mottled with white , hair like hay after it has been mowed in the field and lies tossed and streaked ? his physiology corroborating a rugged phrenology ? a person singular ? ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illiterate ? one who has firm attachments here and associates there ? one who does not associate with literary people ? a man never called upon to make speeches at public dinners ? never on platforms amid the crowds of clergymen , or professors , or aldermen , or congressmen ? rather down in the bay with pilots in their pilot-boat ? or off on a cruise with fishers in their fishing-smack ? or riding on a Broadway omnibus , side by side with the driver ? or with a band of loungers over the open grounds of the country ? fond of New York and Brook ? lyn ? fond of the life of the great ferries ? one whom , if you should meet , you need not expect to meet an extraordinaryperson one in whom you will see the singularity which consists in no singular ? ity ? whose contact is no dazzle or fascination , nor requires any deference , but has the easy fascination of what is homely and accustomed ? as of some ? thing you knew before , and was waiting for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new offspring out of literature , taking with easy nonchalance the chances of its present reception , and , through all misunderstandings and dis ? trusts , the chances of its future recep ? tion ? preferring always to speak for himself rather than have others speak for him . " And consider that the man who " never dressed in black " is the Walter Whitman of the frock coat , the high hat , and the boutonniere . He is the roughly clothed and rugged workingman " who does not associate with literary people . " The Democratic politician of the Free ? man and the public lecturer on art is " never on platforms amid the crowds of clergymen , or professors , or aldermen , or congressmen . " This anxious barker for his own book is " taking with easy non ? chalance the chances of its present reception , " " preferring always to speak for himself " ? in his poems , of course ? " rather than have others speak for him , " as his anonymous reviewer is supposed to be speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise his Walt : " A rude child of the people ! ? No imitation ? No foreigner ? but a growth and idiom of America . No discontented ? a careless slouch , enjoying to-day . No dilettante demo ? crat ? a man who is art-and-part with the commonalty , and with immediate life ? loves the streets ? loves the docks ? loves the free rasping talk of men ? likes to be called by his given name , and nobody at all need Mr. him ? can laugh with laughers ? likes the ungenteel ways of laborers ? is not prejudiced one mite against the Irish ? talks readily with them ? talks readily with niggers ? does not make a stand on being a gentleman , nor on learning nor manners " ? and so on , down to the end of the paragraph : " You may feel the unconscious teaching of a fine brute , but you will never feel the artificial teaching of a fine writer or speaker . " In other words , the dilettante demo ? crat , Walter Whitman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is a " careless slouch " ; that he is no longer " a fine writer or speaker " but " a fine brute " who is " unconscious " of the teaching of which he is here so conscious . He is such an astonishing radical that he even " likes the ungenteel ways of laborers , " and he feels so little prejudice against the Irish that he " talks readily with them . " Most miraculous of all , he now likes to be called by his given name " and nobody at all need Mr. him . " And this last is a proof of his utter democracy which he repeats with unction in his later self-advertisements . He ballyhooed himself , anonymously , in the American Phrenological Journal as the " haughtiest of writers that has ever yet written and printed a book " And in the United States and Democratic Review , for the same month of Septem ? ber 1855 , he hailed himself , anony ? mously , as " One of the roughs , large , proud , affectionate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , his face sunburnt and bearded , his postures strong and erect . " No longer the fash ? ionable gentleman of great culture , he announced , rather incoherently : " self-restraint , with haughty eyes , assuming to himself all the attributes of his country , steps Walt Whitman into literature , talk ? ing like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book , or such a being as a writer . " As if he were afraid that some contemporary Comstock might fail to advertise his poems by attempting to suppress them , he goes on : " Nature he proclaims in ? herently clean . Sex will not be put aside ; it is the great ordination of the universe . He works the muscle of the male and the teeming fibre of the female , throughout his writings , as wholesome realities , impure only by deliberate in tention and effort . . . If health were not his distinguishing attribute , this poet would be the very harlot of persons . Right and left he flings his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to his close embrace , loving the clasp of their hands , the touch of their necks and breasts , and the sound of their voices . All else seems to burn up under his fierce affection for persons . " And he printed these three personal advertisements of himself as favorable press notices in the second edition of his poems . As late as 187G , he was still writing of himself , anonymously : " This Walt Whit ? man ? this queer one whom most of us have watched , with more or less amuse ? ment , walking by ? this goer and corner , for years , about New York and Washing ? ton ? good natured with everybody , like some farmer , or mate of some coasting vessel , familiarly accosted by all , hardly any one of us stopping to Mr. him ? this man of many characters , among the rest that of volunteer help in the army hospitals and on the field during the whole of the late war , carefully tending all the wounded he could , southern or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain unsuspected old customer , dressed in gray &; wearing no necktie , America . and her republican institutions are possessing that ram avis a real national poet , chanting , putting in form , in her own proud spirit , in first-class style , for present and future time , her democratic shapes even as the bards of Judah put in song , for all time to come , the Hebrew spirit , and Homer the war-life of prehistoric Greece , and Shake ? speare the feudal shapes of Europe 's kings and lords ! " But perhaps his most extraordinary effort in establishing his alias is the one reported by Fred P. Hill , Jr. , in the American Mercury of June 1924 . Here it appears that Whitman wrote the greater part of the volume Notes on Walt Whitman by John Burroughs , published in 1867 as Burroughs ' first book and since dropped from the list of his col lected works . The style is clearly Whitman 's ; and Burroughs , shortly before his death , admitted in a letter to Hill that about one-half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been edited and revised by Whitman . The personal sketch of Whit ? man was supplied by Whitman himself . It is in the same tone as his anonymous reviews . " There probably lives not another man , " he writes of himself , " so genuinely and utterly indifferent to literary abuse or to ' public opinion , ' either when favorable or unfavorable . He has never used the usual means to defend his reputation . " He describes himself as " seeking not the least con ? quest or display , " but as " making the impression on any unsuspecting stranger of a good-willed , healthy character , without the least ostensible mark of the philosopher or poet ; but all the while , though thus passive and receptive , yet evidently the most masculine of beings . " And so forth , to the same end as always ? to the end of having Burroughs , like the anonymous newspaper reviewers , certify to the truth of the pose which he had assumed in his poetry . Obviously , Walter Whitman was no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not be truly such a person and be aware of it . But what was he ? What was the real Walter Whitman who adopted this alias of Walt Whitman , and put on this disguise of the " careless slouch , " and pretended to all this rough and rugged democracy and sensuality and haughty-eyed con ? tempt ? The answer is written plainly enough in every real biography of him that I have ever seen , as well as by implication in his poems . He was neither sensual , nor rough and rugged , nor truly healthy , nor lusty , nor even very masculine . He was what is nowadays called a Nar ? cissan , in love with himself , introverted , and so wrapped up in his own ego that hegot no free delivery of energy except in his exhibitionism . Hence his constitu ? tional laziness . He was arrested in his sexual development very near the homo ? sexual level , as several of his poems show ; and like many another case of arrested development he was always " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fiercely loved land of his birth " in one of his anonymous blurbs , and in another he assumes " to himself all the attributes of his country " ; but when the Civil War broke out on April 12 , 1861 , he dis ? appeared for eighteen months from the sight of his biographers ; and the only entry in his notebook , for that period , is the following , dated April 16 , 1861 , four days after the beginning of hostilities : " I have this day , this hour , resolved to inaugurate for myself a pure , perfect , sweet , clean-blooded robust body , by ignoring all drinks but water and pure milk , and all fat meats , late suppers ? a great body , a purged , cleansed , spiritual ? ized , invigorated body . " This is not the vow of a patriot worry ? ing about the fiercely-loved land of his birth . It is the resolve of a Narcissan thinking only of his fiercely-loved phy ? sique . Here is the impulse which dressed him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life , and as a rough and rugged workman during another period , and finally as the conspicuous " good , gray poet " in gray cape and wide-awake during his later years . This is the impulse that made him begin his Leaves of Grass with the line " I celebrate myself . " It is the impulse that drove him to celebrate himself in his " own flesh and form , un ? draped , regardless of modesty or law . " The same impulse moves humorously in a letter to two friends , written from Washington during the war , on March 19 , 1863 : " My health , strength , personal beauty , etc. , are , I am happy to inform you , without diminution , but on the contrary quite the reverse . I weigh full 220 pounds avoirdupois , yet still retain my usual perfect shape ? a regular model . " It is an impulse to exhibition ism that is neither sensual nor healthy , but morbid , introverted , and very near perversion . Narcissism is apparently produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother " with a sort of mariolotry " as Holloway says . He broke down , during her final illness , with a partial paralysis . At the age of fifty-six , he wrote of himself , " I occupy myself . arranging these pages for publication , still enveloped in thoughts of the death , two years since , of my dear Mother , the most perfect and magnetic character , the rarest combination of practical , moral and spiritual , and the least selfish of all and any I have ever known ? and by me 0 so much the most deeply loved . " He never married . As a young school-teacher he was " diffident with women . " One of his pupils re ? cords , " The girls did not attract him . He did not especially go anywhere with them or show any extra fondness for their society . Before and after school , he was a boy among boys . " A few years later , at the age of about twenty , as the editor of The Long Islander , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything of women ; because it behooves a modest personage like myself not to speak upon a class of beings whose nature , habits , notions and ways he has not been able to gather any knowledge , either by experience or observation . " During his mature years in Washington , from the age of forty-seven to fifty-four , his most intimate companion was a young street-car conductor named Peter Doyle ; and Doyle has said of him , " I never knew a case of Walt 's being bothered up by a woman . Woman in that sense never entered his head . Walt was too clean . No trace of any kind of dissipation in him . I ought to know about him those years ? we were awful close together . " The appearance of sensuality in Whitman 's verse ? and in his ballyhoos ? is good evidence to a modern psy ? chiatrist that Whitman never experi ? enced the dissoluteness which he cele ? brates . The sexuality in his poems is a compensation , in phantasy , for his lack of potency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homosexual level ? which is to be ex ? pected where the sexual impulse is anchored by a mother-fixation and unable to achieve a heterosexual goal . When an English critic , J. A. Sy ? monds , read the homosexual poems in " Calamus , " he wrote to ask Whitman the truth about himself , and Whitman , at the age of seventy-two , replied : " My life , young manhood , mid-age , times South , etc. , have been jolly bodily and doubtless open to criticism . Though unmarried , I have had six children ? two are dead ? one living Southern grand ? child , fine boy , writes to me occasionally ? circumstances ( connected with their fortune and benefit ) have separated me from intimate relations . " But that state ? ment , written to allay the suspicion of homosexuality , is no more to be trusted than Whitman 's anonymous advertise ? ment of himself as " a lusty breeder . " He wrote of himself , by the hand of John Burroughs , in Burroughs ' Notes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without entering into partic ? ulars , it is enough to say that he sounded all experiences of life , with all their passions , pleasures , and abandonments . He was young , in perfect bodily condi ? tion , and had the city of New York and its ample opportunities around him . I trace this period in some of the poems of ' Children of Adam ' and occasionally in other parts of his book , including ' Calamus . ' " But this testixnbny from John Burroughs has now been wiped out by Burroughs ' own confession that Whitman wrote it . He and Whitman did not meet until 1861 in Washington , and Burroughs knew nothing of Whit ? man 's life in the years 1840-1855 , except what Whitman told him . The truth in all this elaborate de ? ception about " passions , pleasures , and abandonments " seems to be ? as Hollo ? way suggests in his Whitman ? that Walter Whitman , in 1848 , had some sort             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
