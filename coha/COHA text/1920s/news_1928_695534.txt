txt As a result of the conversations between S. Parker Gilbert . Agent General for Reparations Payments ; Prime Minister Baldwin . Winston Churchill , Chancellor of the Exchequer , and repre , sentatives of the British Treasury and Foreign Office , Government officials expected tonight the early formation of an international committee of financial experts to formulate a plan for a definite and complete reparations settlement . The terms of reference under which the committee will work formed the subject of conversations and it is reported that considerable progress was made toward an agreement . Mr. Gilbert left London for Paris tonight . Question of Initiative Open . The diplomatic question of which Government is going to take the initiative in asking officially for the formation of the committee of experts is still unsettled . Even though the negotiations begun at Geneva in September are now progressing swiftly , Treasury experts here doubt whether the international committee about to be formed will make as rapid headway with the problem as their French , . German - and American colleagues hope . The attitude of the Government here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British taxpayer it will do its utmost to hasten a settlement , since it earnestly desires the improvement of Franco-German *Ions . But there is still skepticism in some influential quarters as to whether the moment is opportune to fix a definite total for German payments . . EDWIN JrADIES . Special Cable to PRE NEW YORK TIMES . PARIS , Oct. ** has been explained , the reparation plans on which Allied and German experts are working and with which the present visit of S. Parker Gilbert to London has to do , depend for their success on American cooperation . Based on the discount of Allied payMents to the United States by receipts from the sale of German railroad and industrial securities , these plans not only need the assistance of American bankers and investors to market the bonds but the assistance also of the American Government in agreeing to the discount plan . But not all Europe 's reparation eggs are being put in one basket . The experts are giving attention to the possibility that Washington may refuse all cooperation in the effort to reach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as he is concerned there is nothing to it but that the Allies should pay what they have promised . In that case , the Allies will notify Germany that they expect her to pay its long as the Allies pay , which is to say . for sixty-two years . Basing their demands on the Poincare formula that Germany must pay what France must pay her allies , plus an allowance for reconstruction of war damage , the Allies will try ' to fix an annual payment by Germany to meet that formula . Probable Cut for Germany . If one counts that the Allies owe America $240.000,000 annually one sees that the item to be charged Germany will approximate 1,000,000,000 Marks annually . Then if one calculates that the French calculate their bill for reconstruction at 84,000,000 , - 000 francs , or 14.000,000,000 marks ( about $3,500,000.000 ) and Belgium about 2,000.000,000 marks ( $500,000 , - 000 ) . one reaches approximately another 3,000.000,000 marks , or 2,000 , - 000.000 marks ( $500,000,000 ) in an . Therefore , it Is entirely likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.500. - 000,000 marks , the annual normal payment set by the Dawes plan , to 2,000,000,000 marks annually . Naturally the reconstruction part of Germany 's debts by the amortization process might be finally dealt with in a fewer number of years , but the Allies will insist that the rest of the payments must go on as long as the Allies pay America . This is the plan to which the Allies will turn if all efforts to enlist American cooperation fail . Should America help to sell sufficient bonds to discount the 25 years ' final payments ci the Allies , it is evident that an arrangement is possible which will reduce the term of German payments . Should it ultimately prove feasible to arrange the total Allied payments to America through the aisle of ; 4,000,000,000 worth of German bonds , a ; still more simple settle-. znent is possible . If one examines the situation more closely one will see the possibility ! of all Europe reaching a position 1 similar to that England placed before . the Continent through the Balfour ; plan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay America . Thus , the British diplomats have largely succeeded in placing on the United States the moral blame for England 's debt collecting . If the present plans work out . France will be largely in the same position . She will say to Germany that a better deal for Germany de ' pends on the United States . Thus in the long run , doubtless , the British and French diplomats figure , Germany will become Europe 's leading advocate for . a better deal for Europe on the part of the United States . From the political standpoint the situation holds much interest . Naturally , every effort will be made to enlist the sympathetic cooperation both of , American bankers and the American Government in what is regarded in Europe as a further step towards liquidation of the indebtedness left by the World War . Will America follow the advice of the Bankers ' Association or will America " stand on her rights " ? If we refuse to budge , it is fair to ask whether or not the Old World diplomats are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only for the Allies . paying us for six decades but also for Germany 's baring to pay the Allies for six decades . We may think that unfair . That is what we thought about the FrancoBritish naval bargain . But ow thinking that way , unfortunately , will not control the situation . Despite the present officially voiced position of Washington , we shall probably do well to keep a watchful eye on the debt negotiations now about to begin in Europe . The French have an apt expression which ) says " Les absents ont toujours tort " ( The absent arc always wrong ) .
