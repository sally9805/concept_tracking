Wild Oranges . This screen version of Joseph Hergesheimer 's novel carries out with simple but concrete symbolism the very quality of wild oranges-bitter sweet to the first taste , growing more zestful with each bite , or closeup . Its story is that of a man embittered at fate by the sudden loss of his young bride , who hesitates to take the fruit of Eden offered to him in the person of a lonely girl of the Georgia coast , prisoner alike of fear and a maniacal murderer . The man who fears life 's traps finally clutches at the fruit , rescuing the girl while she saves her own soul from the incubus of fear that has ridden her family . The tale is told with extraordinary vividness and pungency by King Vidor , a director who can evoke a heart-quaking spirit of mystery without a single trapdoor . Frank Mayo , Virginia Valli , Ford Sterling , Nigel de Brulier are splendid instruments in one of the exceptional pictures of the year . And a most extraordinary characterization is done by Charles A. Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's mind that wanted to be good . <P> Icebound . Producer De Mille has dogged the footsteps of Owen Davis 's play , except at the single point where he should have stuck closer than a brother . He does not have the wastrel ex-doughboy , returned to his granite New England , set fire to a barn out of heady spite . The cinema producer has the arson committed purely by accident , obviously to keep the censor from snaking a reproving finger . What was good enough to win the Pulitzer prize for 1922 for Playwright Davis is not good enough to get past the screen Cerberus . Thus the ne'er-do-well of the play , discontented with his frigidly austere environment , is apotheosized in the films into a pretty good boy , much put upon for mocking local narrowness . The shiftless youth who was saved by his mother 's hand , reaching out from the grave through a devoted girl , becomes merely a sulky Achilles , not far enough gone to the dogs to require a lifeline . <P> Daughters of Today . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving lurid peeps at the flappers and gilded youths of this age in a Hollywood mood . It carries its own criticism , in that the author-producer prefers to remain anonymous .
