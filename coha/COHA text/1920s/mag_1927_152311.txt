If the approaching automobile war between Henry Ford and General Motors Corp . were symbolized in armaments , Mr. Ford would be a cannon and General Motors a machine gun . When a Ford product strikes the market squarely , as did Model T when first shot into a world of pedestrians , the battle is over . But when the Ford product misses , as Model T has been missing ever since economic prosperity in the U. S. caused the public to shift from mere transportation to touring with style , it misses by a mile . Though Henry Ford has added to his weapon such potent arms as the Lincoln motors and an airplane manufacturing unit , his big gun has always been Model T Ford . General Motors Corp. , on the other hand , spreads its shots . It sends out a car to strike every purse-Chevrolet , Oldsmobile , Pontiac , Oakland , Buick , LaSalle , Cadillac . It carefully picks up its dead shells and turns them into electric refrigerators , an effective barrage to cover a retreat . It invests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far afield , on Europe , on Australia , scattering its products all over the globe . <P> Last week lean , suave President Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr . of G. M. C. and Henry Ford declared that there was no war contemplated between them , that they were shooting at different targets . Said Mr. Sloan : " If the past is any indication of the future , the new Ford car will be a car that will appeal to a great mass of people . Naturally , that car must meet present conditions , but the basic idea is likely to be the same . General Motors is in quite a different position . General Motors ' idea is to make a car of greater luxury than the Ford , a car that properly belongs to the next higher price class . " * Earlier Mr. Ford had said : " We have no desire to take business away from any automobile manufacturer . Our thought has always been that the automobile business is prosperous only when all the makers of good cars are busy . " But Chevrolet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive , William Knudsen , have been hitting near enough to the low-priced market for automobiles to demolish almost half the target aimed at by the Ford Motors Co . In 1924 Ford scored 2,083,545 sales to Chevrolet 's 587,341 . By 1926 that score was changed to read Ford , 1,810,000 ; Chevrolet , 1,234,850 . This year in the first six months , it reads G. M. C. , 586,444 ; Ford , 332,384 . Before the end of the year the score will stand still higher in G. M. C. favor . <P> This is because-Ford has ceased firing until he can get his big gun trained on the shifted target of public opinion . It has moved in the direction of racy lines , snappy colors , manual gear shift , speed . It will be 1928 before Ford has tested his product sufficiently well to allow it to re-enter into the conflict .
