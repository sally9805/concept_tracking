txt Because of the reaction in steels has eentienced for approginsately five days , there have been many additions to the musks of those who believe that the decline will extended further . Before the opening Saturday , leading observers in commission houses were advising their customers to take , profits on whatever stocks they were carrying on the theory that they could be repurchased , probably in the new week at more attractive levels . Needless to say , this recommendation resulted in bringing new selling into some of the leading stocks and caused further unsettlement for the time being . There are but a few advisors who actually advocated that the standard issues be accumulated on further reactions and as a result of the inability of the market to show any material rallying tendency during the past few days few were inclined to follow this advice . About the only demand that was encountered at times during the short session was from shorts who were covering uecause they did not care to carry stocks short over Sunday . There was , hoeSever , some buying by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their favorites at the lower levels . The most conservative market interests were of the opinion that stocks should be allowed to become ere Oilseed before new commitments on the long side are attempted . but it was evident that these observers were strongly opposed to short selling at present , because they fersed that the market would become oversold and might have a substantial rally before the end of the new week . Professionals continued to press stocks for sale and uncovered stop orders , giving them an opportunity to cover some of . the short commitments put out earlier in the week , without influencing a recovery in the general list . This element always works along the lines cf least resistance , but could be expected to switch suddenly to the long side again at the first indication the he decline hassbeen halted . SHORT INTEREST LARGE Professional operators and floor traders have been selling stocks short , and their pressure has been sufficient to cause the lower prices that have been established . The reactionary trend has gathered many small interests to the short side also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent that even some of the so-called outsiders are inclined to put out short lines . There is not doubt that the technical position of the market has been improved to a considerable extent because of the selling of the past few days , but it is probable that those who have been attacking the market are working to bring about a heavy liquidating period , and if this is accomplished they hope to be able to cover their stocks at a profitable basis . PROFIT  --  TAILING LARGE Customers of commission houses who have been carrying certain stocks from materially lower levels have been taking profits during the past two days because teiiir advisors have been urging them to do so . This has increased the supply at times , and , while the less courageous shorts have been covering during such selling , the bearish feeling has been spreading so that a new source of selling has been developed . For the time being few pools are active . Members of such groups have stepped aside to permit the market to seek its own level , and much depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to whether or not the pools will resume activities in earnest . Naturally , with this source of demand out of the way temporarily at least the profit taking has been having its effect on stocks . - TAX SELLING More talk is heard of Belling for the purpose of realizing funds to make the payments on the income tax instalment next Wednesday , but it must be admitted the discussions are two-sided . Many market interests are inclined to credit considerable pressure to this cause , but there are others who contend that those who must make payment do not wait until the last few days to get the money . Commission houses report that they have not been getting any large orders that could be attributed ' o tax selling , and many are now waiting for the market developments of the early part of the new week , which should show conclusively whether the tax instalment has been a recent factor .

However , it is believed that the stock will be put on , a larger cash dividend basis . At present $5 a share annually is being paid . Comment is heard on the increased earnings of the company . In 1925 they amounted to about $95,000,000 , having doubled in 10 years , and estimates are made that the total will pass the $100,000,000 mark this year . Selling in Montgomery Ward has been impressive , and has come through some of the largest Chicago houses , which is taken to indicate a supply from important quarters . It was stated earlier in the week that some of the proceeds realized on sales of Montgomery Ward were put into Pullman , and this is considered to have been significant . In quarters where Montgomery Ward was a favorite only a few weeks ago it is predicted that the stock will soon be placed on a $4 a share annual dividend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock is selling high entomb , and many believe the possibility of a dividend has=iseen discounted in the past .
