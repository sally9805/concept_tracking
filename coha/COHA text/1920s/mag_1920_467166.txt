LET us begin with a little homily on fashions and styles . They domi-nate us , and we may as well admit it . Probably not a man of us would be willing to walk down street in a hunter 's pink coat , even though the day were cold , the coat warm , and the fit comfortable . We are , all of us , and I confess it for myself , afraid to be different from other people , or even to appear so . We live in the chains of convention , and most of us glory in our shackles . We follow the human bell-wether in his goings-out and his comings-in , in his dress , his habits , his virtues , and his vices ; and we follow him in his thoughts . It is , however , abundantly worth while , I think , to wander off occasionally by ourselves in meditation , and to consider in what kind of a world we might be living if we were to follow other leadings and were to think differently from our accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my purpose to imagine that it were the fashion to know something of chemistry ; that whoever lacked this understanding would be deemed ignorant , and that , being ashamed to acknowledge ignorance , we should all profess to have a chemical conscience . There would doubtless be hypocrites among us ? those who , professing a chemical conscience , had no conscience at all . But persons of this sort we have always with us , and if convention required such a profession from them , it might be that even out of their hypocrisy the lesser evil would develop . Therefore , I shall imagine that chemistry , which has more to do intimately with the processes of life than any other study ? it is broader than physiology , which teaches us the functions of organs , while chemistry teaches us their operations -- I shall imagine , I repeat , that chemistry were in the public mind , and that the chemical view of things were incorporated in the mores , in the customs , in the folkways . This is not the case at present . We study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works ; but we do not take it home with us . Let us avail ourselves of some very simple , some very homely examples to make this point clear . Suppose a chemist 's wife or his mother or sister buys a number of yards of cloth to be made into a gown . It is to be a winter gown , and its purpose , as distinguished from a summer garment , is to keep her warm . She wants it to be of wool , because she knows by experience that wool is warmer than cotton or linen . In making the purchase she asks the clerk in the store if it is all wool , and she is assured that it is . The clerk does not know except that the buyer said so , and the chances are that the buyer does not know except that the jobber from whom he purchased it said so . And the jobber does not know except that a manufacturer 's agent said so , and he may have been at slight pains to find out . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods in a test-tube in a solution of caustic soda the wool will dissolve , and the cotton will not ; it is one of the simplest tests that can be made , and it can be accomplished in five minutes . But I doubt if one in a thousand chemists does this thing . So the wife or mother may buy goods supposed to be woolen that are in large part cotton , and she may , and often does , catch cold because of this fact . Again , suppose the cloth to he all wool , as guaranteed , but to he made of stuff woven and sold and worn and discarded and recovered so many times that the fibers are not long enough to hold the material together , and that the cloth is more like a film of putty than a well-woven fabric . It may have a fine finish and yet lack the strength to hold its shape . A glance through a cheap microscope will reveal this ? but how many of us have a microscope in the house for testing fabrics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of us practise it ? This may sound like scolding , but , if so , I assure you it is directed as much against myself as against anybody else . We do not make these easy tests because others do not make them . It seems so hard ? indeed , almost impossible , to be different from others , and it is so easy to imitate them and to follow after them . If chemistry were a conscious subject in the public mind , it is probable that one of the greatest of the arts , which is also within the domain of science , the art of cooking , would receive the attention it deserves . Let us imagine ourselves to be beings from another planet ? from Mars , for instance ? engaged in observing the habits of men and women of this earth . Let us also consider ourselves to be enlightened in science , and without prejudice . Then we might report to our Martian authorities upon American habits in relation to food and clothing in this fashion : " Our observations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the people suffer from a confusion of the senses . According to their very curious customs , they fashion their clothes rather with an eye to appearance than for purposes of warmth , or covering qualities , or comfort . More particularly in the eastern and central parts of the great republic their summer weather is of a tropical nature ; nevertheless , their men wear clothes of wool throughout the hot season . Now wool is , from the structure of its fibers , the warmest of their fabrics , and it is only with difficulty that it may be made clean . They have other fabrics , of cotton and of linen , which provide easy passage of air , and which , therefore , are much more suitable for hot weather , and they may be washed again and again without deteriorating . Every passing breeze which the wearer of cotton or linen encounters causes his perspiration to evaporate , and by this endothermic process his skin is cooled in the hottest weather . Nevertheless , very few men wear such fabrics . Custom demands wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summers . Therefore , American men , both rich and poor alike , persevere throughout their seasons of extreme heat in wearing these expensive , unclean , and uncomfortable garments . " More remarkable still are their methods of preparing food . Eating and drinking are the most intimate processes known to man , because what he consumes is about to become a part of his very self . Here we observe that , in relation to food , women care more for its appearance than for its taste , whereas men usually care more for its taste and odor than for its appearance . Nevertheless , the preparation of foods is assigned chiefly to women . Cooking , which is a chemical art , is not generally treated either as a science or as an art , but rather as a trade . Now it . is a science and an art at the same time , but we also note that among these curious people science and art are not yet even wedded . Occasionally we have observed cooking carried on as a science , with calories measured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is nearly always done without the illumination of art , without imagination ; and usually it fails to please , because it fails esthetically ; because , in a gastronomic sense , it is an ugly thing , offensive both to taste and smell , or else it is , in the same sense , so inert as to he repulsive . Some food chemists , and occasionally some medical authorities on diseases of the digestive tract , never seem to realize that the process of eating consists , first , in stimulation ; second , mastication ; and third , digestion . " Man is so constructed that he needs the ministration of art on every hand ? but he does not seem to realize it , except when he suffers from ennui ; and then he usually attributes this to some other cause ; he is likely , for instance , to find fault with the proper scientific preparation of his food on the false premise that if it is chemically correct it must be esthetically wrong . " The kitchen , or laboratory , in which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or back of his dwellingplace , so that it occupies the least desirable part of the house . The women of his family strive to avoid the work entailed in the preparation of eatables , and prefer to pay large sums to have it done badly rather than to do it themselves . Kitchen and scullery are usually combined in the same room , so that all the gross work of cleansing and peeling and cutting up is made part of the cooking . They do not distinguish between the labor of the scullion and the art of the cook . They combine inone the least agreeable and the most honorable duties of the household . " They have not yet reached the stage in which the master of the house is also the cook , for the reason that he should not intrust this delicate and important art to anybody else . Let us consider the improvement which such a change in their customs would bring about . It is a mistake to declare that the men would not have the time . Most men do not work over eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when the day 's work is over the head of the family is too tired to do anything is an error in psychology . He is not too tired to read his paper or to play a game of billiards at his club or elsewhere , or , as he frequently did until lately , to sit down and drink a considerable measure of ethyl alcohol mixed with water , sugar , and fragrant ethers , esters , and other organic bodies , at some place on his way home . CXLL ? No. 841. -6 " Good form would require of him that he be an artist in respect to cookery , and he would therefore he ashamed to be incompetent , or ignorant of its refinements . He would surely be expected to cook the repast if he entertained his friends , because to offer his friends food for the cooking of which he was not responsible would be a confession of his incompetence and ignorance . It would be a far greater social disability for a man of years to be unable to cook than for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wasting their substance and using up the proper inheritance of their children by the high cost of their living . The reason for this is plain . They do not know how to cook ; they do not know the gustatory value of herbs ; the women they employ to prepare their nourishment know cooking merely as a trade , and they lack the culture and imagination to make savory dishes of any but the most expensive materials . Under intelligent guidance the cost of food might be reduced in remarkable measure and a better order of living attained . Under such circumstances the kitchen and the dining-room would be one , while the scullery would be a place apart . The scientific householder would insist that his materials be made ready ; he would compute a proper balance of food values ; he would operate with test-tubes for his flavors and with scales for his proportions ; and so great is the possible variety that no two meals would be alike . He could maintain laboratory cleanliness instead of kitchen cleanliness , which would be a marked step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a feast . " In their prehistoric days ? when high orders of civilization also reigned ? the smell of cookery was so pleasant that burnt-offerings were made to the gods , to the end that they might enjoy the savory incense from them . Americans now claim that the smell of cooking is offensive to them , but with methods available for controlled draughts , and electric and gas cooking , the preparation of the evening meal could well be made a pleasurable ceremony . " The responsibility for artistic cookery on the part of every householder would develop other arts in life , and it is these which are most needed . If a man lacked the intelligence to learn the chemistry of foods and the esthetic capacity to prepare them so as to make life more enjoyable and agreeable , he might well pass for a worthy person , but he would have to acknowledge himself a dullard in the graces of life , and take the consequences . " So much for the comments of the imaginary Martians . Now let us come to earth again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let us proceed to imagine how things would he if we had , all of us , a chemical conscience . What should we say to a high-pressure steam locomotive ? As boys , of course , we should want to drive it , but as men we should be irritated by its waste . What should we say to digging coal at the mines ? and wasting it in the digging . . . and breaking it in breakers ? and wasting some . . . and grading it ? and wasting some . . . and transporting it ? and wasting some .. and weighing and storing and loading it on trucks , and reweighing and trucking and delivering  - -  and wasting a lot more ? and the stevedore work of storing it in our cellars , and burning it in our wasteful furnaces and grates and kitchen stoves ? It would offend us , and we should insist on a better order of things . We know better now , but , I repeat , we lack the chemical conscience to insist that such wasteful methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun be abolished . And we should demand better ways . What should we think of Niagara Falls ? I can but reply by using an idea proposed by my friend , Dr. Arthur D. Little , of Boston , who drew a picture of that vast power of falling water put to human use , and beside this another Picture ? that of a huge bonfire of coal , maintained as an international show , capable of developing the same measure of power to offset it . He visualized the many thousand miners at work , the trains running day and night , and the coal fed to the great . fire in chutes , making a colossal , a magnificent , exhibition . But for how long should we allow such a waste to go on , increasing , as it would , the cost of living to us all ? That falling water , however , not put to use does have the effect of just such a great , wasteful bonfire , and by our very neglect to use it we do increase our costs of living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal . We need a quickened sense of the chemistry of things . We are living in a sort of fool 's paradise in which we are increasing prices and rents and wages and costs until , unless we take heed , we shall not be able to sell a cotton handkerchief in competition with any other country that makes them ? and we need chemistry to save us , to help us economize . Chemistry aids industries ; that is already established , although many industries are laggard in research . But our more immediate need is to bring it . into daily life . We must , for instance , find some bleaching agent other than chlorine for the family wash . Chemical industry furnishes the chlorine in one form or another to the laundries , and the laundries can stand it , but the families can not . A Fellow of the Mellon Institute made some experiments with men 's collars to determine the effects of chlorine bleach . He laundered one series with bleach and another control series without it , and the bleached collars broke after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washings . Threads which broke when a weight of 1,725 grams was attached to them were washed and bleached twenty times and then a weight of 100 grams broke them . It is economically wrong to go on making and destroying cotton cloth that way ? especially when cotton is both scarce and expensive . On the other hand , there is no reason why we should not sprinkle our streets with chlorinated water in the interest of good health . That is something we " have n't got around to " yet , although the experiment was tried , once , over a small area , in Philadelphia , for a little while , without keeping any records , and , since nobody noticed anything , the plan was given up . In the mean time we let our streets go foul , and literally we rend our garments with chlorine , in the name of progress ! To wander away from the household , the kitchen , the washtub , and the things of every day , it would he of great advantage to us if chemical thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more frequent , more general , more common . I am not singing the praises of chemical jargon ; what I have in mind is a more general understanding and imagination in chemistry . In this respect the Postulates of Irving Langmuir bid fair to be of singular helpfulness . They aid us to picture what happens in every chemical reaction , from a lighted candle to the complex problems of laboratory research . We can only touch lightly on this immense work . Langmuir holds with the brilliant but lamented Muscly , who was killed as a common soldier at the battle of Gallipoli , at the age , as I recall it , of twenty-four , that the atomic number of each element in the Periodic table , beginning with hydrogen as No. 1 ; helium as 2 ; No. 3 , eta do ara to uranium , Na. 92 , is also an index of the . positive chases upon the nuclet-3 of ita atom The 92 possib ? elements are numbered from 1 to 92 accordir. ta'y as their atomic weights increase . Then the atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom , because the electrons are negatively charged , and we assume a negative charge to offset each positive change . Now Langmuir pro-poses that the habitat of each electron in an atom is circumscribed , and that their positions , one beyond the other , are in layers , and that the outside of every atom , except those of hydrogen and helium , may be considered , as to the average positions of its electrons , as a tetrahedron ; as approximating the form of a cube ? like a child 's toy block . There is a place for an electron at every one of its eight corners . Helium is perfectly balanced with a pair of electrons opposite a pair of positive charges , while all the other inert gases are perfectly balanced , with every available space , both within and at the so-called corners of the outer cubes , taken up by an electron . The atoms of these gases are , therefore , complete symmetrical entities , and for that reason they do not form molecules , and they are inert ; they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases is every one of the eight corners of the cube or spaces in what he calls the outer shell of the molecule occupied by an electron . He postulates that while electrons normally repel one another , in the presence of positive charges they group themselves in pairs and in groups of eight , and that this drive to frame themselves up into pairs or octets is greater than the electrostatic force which holds them in position on the outer layer of atoms . And he naikes this taking and giving of pairs of electrons among atoms and molecules the basis of all chemical combination and reaction . When , then , an atom or group of atoms loses or gains electrons , so that its number of electrons is either greater or less than the positive charges upon the nucleus , it becomes an ion . This stands to reason , because under the conditions stated it is bound to be either positively or negatively charged . Now if this theory works out as well in practice as it promises to do , we shall have some remarkable means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' these or other theories we shall be able to see in imagination the various and sundry steps of every chemical reaction , and we shall get much farther ahead than we do now . If we could see clearly in imagination the molecules of those organic bodies which produce dyes ? in short , if we could develop stereochemistry to such a degree that we could build up molecules by means of blocks properly designated to indicate the component atoms , and with hooks affixed for bonds , we should know what we want ; we should avoid unnecessary experiment , and we should advance chemistry in a remarkable measure . In the great domain of olfactory phenomena we should , with a better understanding of the forms of molecules and of the forces within them , get beyond the technology of the perfume industry and study the processes of this Cinderella of the human senses . Of course the chemistry of olfactics is not chemistry for every man . I confess frankly that it reaches clear beyond chemistry for me . Rut , as we have set forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human organ whereby we may become cognisant of matter in an extraordinary state of attenuation . If chemists can teach mankind that the human nose is worth while for this very reason , they will have made a far greater contribution to humanity than the ? discovery of coal-tar dyes or high-speed steel , or anything else that increases wealth without increasing our understanding . Chemistry has made marvelous contributions to technology and to wealth ; it has provided important advances in the art of maintaining health and combating disease . Now let us hope that it will make still greater contributions which will aid in the development of the human mind and human understanding . Still another subject on which we need light is the labile nature of living matter . The reversible status of , for instance , proteins and amino acids , of glycogen and sugar , of the innumerable reversible and irreversible processes of metabolism , should be made comprehensible and opened up to us , so that we may get closer to nature and reach deeper into the processes of life . When the understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain them . Of course it is not to be expected that every man will comprehend everyprocess , step by step , but if this is done by chemists , then chemists will comprehend also the principles of the reaction , and it is the philosophy of these which every man should know . A clearer sense of atoms and molecules will also make for a far inure clear-cut understanding of things beyond chemistry . We have tried , for instance , to grasp astronomic magnitudes and geologic ages , and in our religious concepts these have influenced us . I want to say , in all reverence , that I believe we have , many of us , tended to push away from us the idea of divinity , the sense of God that we may have , by these very attributes of infinite vastness of space and of power and of might . We have not welcomed into our consciousness the recognition that powers and potentialities clear beyond our grasp are to be found in the infinitely minute as well as in the infinitely great . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we grow in understanding of nature we shall see deeper mysteries , and that in this knowledge we may approach nearer to Divinity ? the Divinity that will always be far beyond us , because of our limited capacities to explore and to understand . I believe there is a nobler , a finer , and a more reverent understanding awaiting us as we approach nearer the Truth . In other words , we are still too far away from the chemistry of things , and the whole world lacks enough familiarity with it to put it to every-day use in thinking . If we can carry our chemical philosophy home with us it will help to avoid waste , to live better at less cost , and thus to save more , to improve our habits of life and mind , to put an end to public waste and the waste of our national estate ; it will help us to add one of our five senses , now sorely neglected , to the development of life and understanding ; it will develop the imagination , and give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us a clearer understanding of life . This is chemistry for every man !
