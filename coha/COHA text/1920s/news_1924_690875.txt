txt Last year a book called " Bunk , " by IV . E. ' Woodward , gave the American world a chuckle and the advertising industry the laugh of the year . Mr , womiward has a new novel this year which is caned " Lottery , " and it ought to give every one a couple of gurNws . The thing that Mr. Woodward does is to hold up a mirror to rare person whom he is writing about and in the reflection are included of his playmates . With a little acid he etches them all in and turns over the finished picture to us  --  a photograph but with the , effect of a caricature . " Lottery " is the story of a successful business man , one of the socalled self-made sort . ? His success haS been entirely a matter of luck and the sensible people of his town know it . He and the mass think thal he 's a great man . The first part of the book is given over to the hero when he is a salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting started with a patent button . It is like " Babbitt , " only not quite so funny . But the second part , the story of his rise in the social and business world of his town and of the recognition which comes to him through the magazines and newspapers who write get-ahead articles and Sunday supplements about him , is terribly funny . its pretty cruel satire , too . Fake , the whole fabric of his life was , but the kind of fake that can be bought by lavish investors . and which simulates the real in everything except the essential quality of beauty mellowed by age . He reminds one of the gallery of a famous leader of Chicago society , a generation or so ago , who had copies made of all of the masterpieces and hung them , proudly , in her Chicago castle , to the horrified surprise of every cultured European visitor to the city . Coarse , crude , a man whose chief distinction was the fact that he had a way with him , the hero of " Lottery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is early 30s , he finds himself written ' up as the man who by his own efforts made a million before 30 ( the misstatement of a few years in his age might be charged against the overzealousness of his press agent-0 , yes , he had one , like a prima donna ) . " Lottery " is n't a great book . It does n't make any pasSages toward being the great American novel . But it Is a funny book and a keen satire on the self-made millionaire who just happens to strike oil ( in whatever business he goes into ) and who gets so pompous and so certain of his abilities that he thinks he invented all of the successful business methods in vogue in America . " A wealthy man can not tell a Ilei " MOW the author of his hero . " He may make a misstatement through error , Cr in the heat of controversy ; or ho may make a shrewd assertion which is capable of a wrong interpretation , but out.and.out lying is considered , in America at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicals . " That Is the kind of satire Mr. Wood . ward writes , nothing very subtle about it . but " Lottery " is n't a subtle book any more than Andy Gum , , is subtle . It is Andy 's very obviousness that makes him the funniest funny In the world . There arc two terribly funny pages which tell of an advertising campaign for a paint company , Perley by name . and of their sales coriventitm at which the salesmen all Fang a song to the tune of Onward , Christian Soldiers : Onward , Perley salesmen , Marching as to WM , To sell this , great nation The Paints that Endure . Women and dilettantes will be bored by " Lottery . " It is as refined and as elegant as a wad of chewing guni ? But it is also just as American . Two New Play 's . The Theater Arts Monthly has Just Published two plays , the first of a series which they will get out . Stark Young , author of many highly worded criticisms of drama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now York Times has written " The Colonnade , " a drama of the aristocratic south and his first long play .
