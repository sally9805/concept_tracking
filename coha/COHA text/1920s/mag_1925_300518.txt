Is happiness the end of life ? Is evolution incompatible with religion ? My wife wants to bob her hair-how can I stop her ? Should people about to marry confess to each other ? What is the soul ? Is a lie ever justifiable ? Should there be universal birth control ? How ? Why ? When ? Where ? <P> Thus asked the New York Herald Tribune News Syndicate in a large advertisement last week in the Editor and Publisher . Knowing that such questions as these have long plagued humanity , the Herald Tribune was happy to announce that it was at last able to answer them . An oracle had been secured who would devote a column a day to dealing with these and other trifling topics . In response to the query " Who ? " the Herald Tribune proudly answered : <P> " DR . S. PARKES CADMAN . <P> He solves your readers ' personal problems on <P> ETHICS MORALS CONDUCT MANNERS CUSTOMS RELIGION <P> in a , helpful , human way . " <P> For those who entertained any lingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Herald Tribune appended a list of sample questions and answers : <P> What do you consider the greatest menace to the present generation ? <P> Ans. : The disposition which gives the centre of the stage to things which do not matter . <P> Do you believe helpless cripples should be legally lethalized ? <P> Ans. : No . <P> I am doomed to die of cancer and I would like to know what comfort there is for me . <P> Ans. : If any word of mine can cast a single ray of light upon this dark situation , I shall be profoundly thankful . <P> Other questions , other answers , were printed in the Herald Tribune 's advertisement of its new oracle . But a doubt remained , for although Dr. Cadman 's many thousand admirers were quite ready to concede that he must " use his vast store of knowledge on innumerable topics with amazing facility , " and that he was , as advertised , " WISE , WHIMSICAL , EDUCATIONAL , HELPFUL , " there were some who wondered whether his all-embracing wisdom did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal dignity and to his cloth by the ill taste of that circus-barker advertisement .
