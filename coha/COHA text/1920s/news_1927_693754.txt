txt Official reports of boll weevil emergence up to the first of April show an increase over the preceding year . On the face of it , this is a Dullish factor on cotton . But there are so many angles to the cotton situation that the market is not made , or unmade , by the weevil emergence up to April 1 . The great question with the cotton market is wrietner the consumers  --  mills and weevils  --  can dispose of the coming crop and make an appreciable inroad in the surplus . Unless this can be done the situation must remain bearish . The probabilities are that if the summer is cloudy , with an abundance of rain , this can be accomplished . On the other hand , if it is dry and hot , it can not . At this time the cotton acreage can not even be guessed at . In.the past farmers always have been willing to agree to a reduction , only to plant to their capacity . It is true that there is a better organized effort now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belt , at least , cotton was raised at a profit last year , and it is to be expected that those sections will plant to their full capacity this year . it is likely that the hopes of a big reduction will prove a disappointment . Should there be a cut of 10 per cent . of the 1926 acreage , and the yield average that of the past three years , then the production would approximate the probable world consumption . This , of course , must be predicated on average weather , or rather the same conditions as prevailed in the past three years . With production and consumption in that case closely matched , the weevils would be a powerful influence on the side of the bullish element . However , all that is known at this time is that more than the usual number have come out of their hibernation early in the season . It is a fair assumption that this means that there are still greater numbers lying dormant , to come out a little later and to proceed with the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them ; to be to their liking it must be the reverse of what cotton needs . So it comes back to a question of weather ; the weevils need cloudy , moist weather , and the cotton hot and dry . It is not the number of weevils that come out in April , but the number that are bred during . the early summer that will determine the fate of the cotton crop .
