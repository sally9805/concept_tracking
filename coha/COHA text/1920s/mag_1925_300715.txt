Episcopal bishops from Haiti , Minnesota , Pennsylvania and Illinois , in purple and white robes and violet birettas , a group of Army and Naval officers in uniform , and the speakers of the day-Elihu Root , Governor Smith , Sir Campbell Stuart-in high silk hats and sleek frock coats , followed a young crucifer and 100 Eton-collared choir boys in white surplices and purple cassocks up the aisle of the partly finished Cathedral of St. John the Divine , Manhattan , to range themselves along the south wall , while Bishop William Manning , gripping his golden pastoral staff , accompanied by the more notable guests , mounted the platform and began to say a prayer , which was broadcasted to several million people by means of a microphone placed in front of his mouth . The occasion was one of the most important which had ever taken place in that Cathedral , being none other than a dedication of the foundation stone of the enormous nave designed by Architect Ralph Adams Cram . <P> Bishop Manning spoke first . Said he : " On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in hand for the greater glory of God shall never . . . be allowed to stop . " <P> Governor Smith , a Catholic , was next introduced . Said he : " I voice the benediction of the state of New York upon this structure . " <P> The Rev. Dr. S. Parkes Cadman , President of the Federated Council of Churches of Christ in America : " I bring the loving and earnest congratulations . . . of forty million Protestants . " <P> Elihu Root , Sir Campbell Stuart , expressed befitting sentiment . The moment for the actual dedication had come . <P> Bishop Manning , with a silver trowel in his hand , strode down the aisle in swishing panoply until he confronted an enormous block of golden Poughkeepsie granite propped up in the south end of the Cathedral by a block and tackle . Trustee George W. Wickersham described how , in the pit prepared for the stone , lay a copper box , 18 inches long , lined with tin , filled with relics of the Church , lists of contributors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated the Lord 's Prayer , the Bishop traced the sign of the cross upon the rock with his trowel ; Architect Cram gave a signal to his men ; the block and tackle twitched the stone aloft , lowered it reverently into place upon the box . Now there was only one more thing to do . The Bishop picked up a heavy mahogany mallet . Three times he smote the stone and in reverberating accents intoned : <P> " In the faith of Jesus Christ we lay this foundation stone , in the Name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , that here true faith and brotherly love may flourish and abound , and that this place may be a house of prayer for all people , forever to the glory and praise of Christ our Lord .
