In Buenos Aires lived a carpenter , and his name was Jos Vespaciano . He was tall and slender with dark brown eyes and chestnut hair and beard ; people who saw him walk the mean streets in his curious , loose robes of white sometimes started , and felt for their beads . He looked like-well , no matter whom- but it was not well to pass a man like that without a sign . <P> One day a crone was taken sick in the Calle Margaritas Cervantes , where Vespaciano lived . He cured her by repeating a formula , which his neighbors whispered to each other afterward with frightened glances . But there was no fright in the woman . She worshiped him and came to his patio the next night with a crippled friend . The women were joined by an old man and a boy , and every evening after that , when twilight enchanted the Calle Margaritos Cervantes , a grotesque company came up the blue street one by one and knocked on the door of Jos Vespaciano . <P> Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted by the wild turmoil in their heads ; some were boys who admired the carpenter because of his sorrowful eyes and comely figure ; others peddlers and harlots , cripples scabrous with loathsome diseases , twitching paralytics , and mahogany-faced bushmen who had heard of Vespaciano and had come down from the hills . To them he talked of what had been revealed to him ; some he healed , using the same formula with which he had raised his first patient , and it came to the ears of certain authorities that this formula was " Take up thy bed and walk . " A few of Vespaciano 's apostles were taken , questioned , and so the thing came out . They thought he was the Christ . . . . <P> Jos Vespaciano was arrested immediately . The charge was vague , but obviously the thing to do with a man who said he was Christ was to take him in custody . It was indicated by every precedent . To the policemen who apprehended him , the judge before whom he was arraigned , the thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed flagrantly proclaimed that he was the Christ , returned to earth as he had promised . Clearly , then , he was guilty of whatever it was that he was guilty of . Last week he went to prison . <P> In vain his disciples clamored for his liberty ; in vain they pointed out that without anything but water , mystic words and prayers , he had cured members of his faithful band of dreadful ills . Scientists explained that he was harmless ; the annals of abnormal psychology are filled with such examples of monomania . Said a doctor who examined him : " I sincerely believe that if he lived during the twelfth century he would have been heralded as a saint , but as it is he is seized as a lunatic .
