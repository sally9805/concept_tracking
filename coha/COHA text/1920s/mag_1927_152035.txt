At Varese , Italian air port , famed airman Major di Bernardi taxied out on the flying field in a huge , spick-and-span , new plane . A man-child of 11 climbed nervously into the passenger 's cockpit , was securely strapped in . . . . <P> This small passenger sat with tight shut eyes as Major di Bernardi gave his ship the " gun , " sent it roaring down the field , pulled back his joy stick , took off in a flashing swoop . Then , amid the calm speed of upper air strata , the eyes of passenger Vittorio Mussolini , 11 , son of II Duce , opened . Regaining his composure he , later , peeped and peered over the edge of his cockpit , at Italia , far below . <P> Last week passenger Vittorio contributed an article to the news organ Tricolor . Honest , he admitted : " I closed my eyes for a minute . . . . When I opened them we were up high . . . . " Enthusiastic , he fairly crowed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father will let me go up again soon .
