txt President Harding 's misunderstanding of - what the makers of the Pacific treaty Meant by " hienler possessions and insular dominions " was nat ; ural . He supposed , as probably a majority ' of Americans did , that possessions wore lands held and governed under other methods of administration than such applying within the nation and that dominions wore such as the British self-governing dominions of the Pacific . It was strange that Mi . Hughes had not told him Avhat construction the conference had dedided tto put on the phrases and that in this construction the homeland ? of Japan was included , but he had not been told . If he had not been the means of the matter coming to light now it might have waited for a disclosure in the senate debates , where it might have made trouble . Borah might have made a good deal of it , but it Will be harder for him to do do now . the explana ? lion of the American ' delegates gives a satisfactory reason for the interpretation agreed upon . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if the United States , France , and Great Britain agree to respect it that is satisfactory to Americans , who have no intention , of attacking it and do not want Great Britain or France to do so . If we agreed to consult and consider appropriate measures in case of outside aggression against the Japanese homeland that need not alarm us.Op The Japanese homeland as an insular possession toes not include Corea , Manchuria , or Siberia and there is no agreement under the treaty respecting the mainland . If there wore possibility of trouble 3etween Japan and Rubsia the scene of ? action ? multi be on the mainland , and the treaty does tot impose any obligations on America there . France , Great Britain , Japan ; and the ; United States are bound to respect each other'a rights , and it would be a wild alarmist who could see the navy of any other power trying to attack the Ja1 ) ? ants ? islands . There is no such danger and a rhetorician can not create one . Japan may not like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that the Japanese homeland needs no more international police than tho American homeland . If the Japanese do like it , Americans should be satisfied . It will clear up the position of Hawaii , which as a territory of the United States in line for statehood is not an insular possession in the general acceptance of the term . It Is not In the same classification as the Philippines , Guiam , con . If the agreement applies to the Insular Japanese . homeland it applies to the insular American homeland In HaWait and the Aleutian islands . Inasmuch as these lands are American homeland the United States has as much right to fealty them , unconditionally , as It has to fortify any spot on the Pacific coast mainland , and at the same time Japan is under the . same agreement regarding them as it is under respecting the Philippines . It would have saved Mr. Harding some embarrassment if Mr. Hughes had ' told him what the agreement was , but it is a good agreement for the United States and it is a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senate has the opportunity to denounce it as a dangerous , secret understanding .
