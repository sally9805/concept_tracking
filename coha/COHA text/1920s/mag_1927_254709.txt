An invitation went to Dr. J. Gresham Machen of Princeton Theological Seminary last week , the sort of an invitation that could have only caused more embarrassment to an already harassed man . <P> Dr. Machen is a great and learned theologian , a philosopher among preachers . Also he is a literalist . He interprets the Bible strictly , and that has made him vastly unhappy at Princeton , for the greater number of the authorities there have been opposed to his views . When he was named for the Chair of Apologetics , the Board of Directors fought with the Board of Trustees over the appointment . That has been the scandal of the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A. The General Assembly a year ago would not order the appointment . Three weeks ago at San Francisco the General Assembly again snubbed Dr. Machen ( TIME , June 6 ) . <P> Here , decided Fundamentalists , was a man who could command attention for their religious-scientific arguments , which a world busied with crime , catastrophes and aviators has of late ignored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial University at Dayton ( Scopes trial ) , Tenn. , sent a 48-word telegram to his Promotional Director Malcolm Lockhart in Manhattan , ordering him to offer Dr. Machen the presidency of the proposed Bryan Memorial University . Promoter Lockhart made the offer ; told the newspapers . Dr. Machen harassed , unhappy , kept silent .
