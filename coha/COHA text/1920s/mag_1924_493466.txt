Prayer After Youth Oh gods of all enchanting lies , Hear now the louder voice that cries Forever in me , crying and rising , That I am loft beyond devising Of the fearful blood or the quick brain Here puzzling in the dark in vain How I may live , how I may not die While the bright days fall silently And one by one through a cold heaven The bright yearS fall that I am given Out of silence and out of sound Before I turn me back to ground . Oh falling of water , passing of wind , Hear this now ? the blood is thinned , The blue broods lower , the night clings All day long to the cumbered wings , Arid late or soon but sooner now The singing grass and the singing bough Where my eternal summer was I shall not find in tree or grass . No , though the flickering dancers run Endless ever through shadow and sun And laughter slips along the dusk And lover on lover turns to ask What was given before words were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live still and look on this I shall be hollow as emptiness , And the shadows before my eyes Will be shadows of memories . Oh mist of rivers running with death , Hear this now , this is my breath Crying forever , crying in fear Of the eternal messenger Whispering to me in a near night : Oh , now look backward to delight ; Whispering , in the brain 's chamber ? What was yours you may remember , Still the long bolt of your weaving May unroll for your deceiving , But the years ' meridian Passes and comes not again , And ever lower the pole-star Rides behind the mariner . Oh , all gods of enchanting lies , Hear now the louder voice that cries Forever in me , crying and rising , That I am lost beyond devising .. .
