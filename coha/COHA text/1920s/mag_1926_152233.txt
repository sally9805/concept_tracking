Last week a merger was announced which concerns everyone remotely connected with the show business , even those persons whose connection amounts merely to a liking for vaudeville or for going to movies on Saturday night . The Keith-Albee-Orpheum circuits merged with the Producers ' Distributing Corp. , a company better known simply by the name of its principal owner , Cecil Blount De Mille . By the terms of consolidation the De Mille Co. will furnish the theatres of the circuit with " a definite and important program of photoplay entertainment . " The Keith-Albee-Orpheum circuit is the only large circuit in the U. S. that has never engaged in producing cinemas ; now it becomes practically the official exhibitor for De Mille features , Metropolitan productions , Christie comedies . <P> De Mille pictures generally deal , in a spectacular manner , with the problems which confront adult society women of ancient or modern times . " I want to show human life as vividly as possible , but always some bit of life that has real meaning and purpose , " Mr. De Mille has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languid importunity in boudoirs through which Gounod 's " Ave Maria " wanders like an oddly-chosen perfume , not infrequently assist the meaning and purpose of Mr. De Mille 's productions ; he has also become famous for ballroom scenes in which the heroine ( who has entered from a side door , disguised as a buttercup ) is unmasked by her lover amid an extraordinary profusion of confetti and colored paper tape . But a taste for indoor panoramas has not seriously deranged Mr. De Mille 's genuine sense of drama ; it is perhaps the natural development of his very panoramic career . <P> His father , Henry C. De Mille , was a playwright ; Cecil wrote plays too , studied the theatre for many years before he went into moving pictures . One day in 1913 he was having lunch with Jesse L. Lasky . <P> " Why do n't you go into moving pictures ? " said Lasky . <P> " I will if you will , " replied De Mille , and the two forthwith drafted articles of incorporation on the back of a menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable in Los Angeles for a studio and there made The Squaw Man ; next year De Mille produced The Cheat and The Golden Chance , and moved out of the stable . He told dramatic stories-biblical , historical , educational-so successfully that when he travels now he takes with him a retinue of secretaries , lawyers , agents , etc. , that often requires an entire hotel floor . <P> Director De Mille quitted the Famous Players-Lasky Corp . last year to become Vice President in charge of production of the Producers ' Distributing Corp . Still more lately he formed a new Cinema Corporation of America with ten millions of capital and the extensive Cecil De Mille Studios , where he means to direct two or three pictures a year .
