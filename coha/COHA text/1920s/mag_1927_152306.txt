As the football season opened , puzzled followers read and reread the new rules and finally fixed these essential changes in their minds : <P> 1 ) Goal posts will no longer stand on goal lines , but in the same relative positions ten yards back . This shift will prevent injury to players smashing into posts on touchdown plays and will eliminate confusion caused by the old position of posts , often in the way of goal line plays and punts from back of the line . Drop-kickers will have to boot ten yards harder to score three points . <P> 2 ) Time changes . Attacking teams are limited to 30 seconds between plays ( eliminating " stalling " when a team is ahead in the last quarter ) . Attacking teams may crouch in a " huddle " only 15 seconds giving signals . Shift plays are prohibited unless the attacking team stops a full second between the players , shift and the snapping of the ball from centre . Violation of the 15-second " huddle " rule costs five yards ; violation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Quarterbacks breathed easier . No longer can a team that has just punted pick up a muffed punt and score . The punting team can recover such a punt but the ball is down where muffed . <P> 4 ) Lateral passes are protected . In previous seasons only forward passes were declared dead when uncaught or knocked to the ground . Now the attacking team can perfect a lateral passing attack with same protection . This change is expected to develop a complicated and spectacular system of open passing play . Lateral passes , however , can be intercepted like forward passes , and run back for gains and touchdowns.
