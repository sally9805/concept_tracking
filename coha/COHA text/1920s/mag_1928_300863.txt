( See front cover ) <P> When Nominee Hoover , who is none too fond of newsgatherers , apostrophized " those invisible millions , " the radio audience , it was perhaps with the hope that some day a Nominee 's baby-patting , pipe-smoking and flycasting will not have to be overseen by newsgatherers clutching shorthand pads and cinema cranks . Perhaps , some day , contact between the People and their servants can be maintained directly , by **27;10871;TOOLONG or something . Then , at scheduled moments during the day or week , the Nominee can simply take off his invisible-silencing-suit or whatever device has been provided for his privacy , and , face-to-face and mouth-to-ear with the whole electorate , can simply say : " Good morning , everybody . I 'm feeling fine today . I had a good sleep and prunes for breakfast , thank you . As you can see , the weather 's lovely here . I think I 'll go fishing this afternoon . Do n't forget what I said about intending to help the Farmer and to uphold the sanctity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Goodbye . As everyone knows , I 'll be ' on ' again at 8 o'clock this evening . " <P> Pending the perfection of such an invention , the People and the Nominees will probably continue making shift with the daily press , which , in politics , has two ends . The People are familiar with one end , the Nominees with both ends . The People find their end lying on millions of white stoops , on thousands of newsstands . The Nominees find their end waiting around in hotel lobbies , anterooms of suites , railroad stations , private car platforms . Their end is " The Boys , " as Presidents Roosevelt and Harding used to call their entourage of newsgatherers . <P> During a Presidential campaign , The Boys are deployed more widely , organized more highly , function more extensively than at any other period in the four-year U. S. political cycle . <P> " Straight " Reporters . Humblest , because their names seldom appear ; most serviceable , because they are instructed to be nonpartisan , to avoid prediction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happenings factually and completely ; most influential , because their reports reach by far the greatest number of people-are what might be called the Straight Reporters , the correspondents of the big news services . This year the Associated Press keeps two men and a woman , the United Press one man , near each Nominee continually . Writing their cautious , colorless reports , these writers are either unsung heroes or stenographic automata . <P> The names of these eight outstanding intermediaries between People and Nominees are : <P> With Hoover . For the Associated Press - James L. West , W. B. Ragsdale , Mary Bainbridge Hayden . For the United Press - Paul R. Mallon . <P> With Smith . For the United Press-Thomas L. Stokes . For the Associated Press-Paul Frederick Haupert , David Harold Oliver , Martha Dalrymple .
