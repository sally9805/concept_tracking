txt Though five men ' were arrested late last night chargedwith having kidnapped Giuseppe Verotta ten days ago and three of them had confessed , the police early this morning were ignorant of the fiveyear-old child 's whereabouts in the face of the stubborn silence of the man they accused of being the leader of the Black Hand band . While detectives of the Italian squad volleyed questions at this man , Antonio Marino of 349 East Thirteenth Street , others sped about the city in a vigorous hunt for the lad , lest news of the capture of the gang lead to a removal to a remote place or even to his destruction . A letter received by the father , John Verotta of 354 West Thirteenth Street , subsequent to the original letter demanding $2,500 ransom mailed to Mrs. Verotta , was postmarked Brooklyn , and one squad of searchers was rushed there following the captures .

The men had told readily everything they appeared to know about the kidnapping , and it was evident they could render no aid in the actual finding of the boy . One of those who confessed , the detectives announced after a brief examination in Police Headquarters , was James Ruggiere , stepson of Marino , who admitted having written the original black hand letter , but insisted he had done so only under repeated threats of death at the hands of Marino if he refused . The others who confessed according to the police were John Melchionne living at a Chatham Square lodging house and Robito Raffaelle of 171 Palisades Avenue , Union Hill , N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little information and refused to admit his guilt .

Clever acting on the part of the Stricken father , coupled with cunning , effective detective work by ' Miss Rae Nicoletti , attached to the staff of Mrs. George W.

It was disclosures she wormed from him which led the detectives to be certain they were seizing all the right men after the go-between was caught .

Among them was said to have been Miss Anne Morgan , sister of J. P. Morgan . The police , according to reports which filtered from beyond the green baize door , behind which Acting Captain Fiachetti of thee Italian squad and his men were volleying questions at their prisoners , were determined not to cease their interrogations for an instant until one of the men should reveal the boy 's whereabouts . A fast automobile was in waiting so that a rescue party might sally forth at top speed the instant the hiding place should be disclosed . At the same time every precaution was taken to prevent word of the capture of the band reaching any possible confederates , lest Giuseppe be sprited away to some new hiding place . While the police were not even sure the child was in New York they were satisfied that he had not been killed . They based this certainty more than anything on the fact that one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy after $2,500 had been demanded at first . They do not think there was any intention of restoring Giuseppe for any such sum after the trouble and risk the band had run . Instead they believe it was the purpose of the kidnappers to mulct the father of every cent of his life 's savings , a little at a time , under renewed threats of torture and death for the little-fellow . It was last Wednesday afternoon that the first ray of hope came to the Verotta family . Till then they had been persuaded that because Giuseppe was a bright , intelligent child of five able to tell where he had been kept and perhaps who were his captors , the kidnappers never would dare to free him . That afternoon while John Verotta , the father , chauffeur for a wholesale grocery company ' , was at home eprnforting the young wife , who was near collapse , a mysterious Italian came to see him on the top floor of 354 East Thirteenth Street .

With tears in his eyes he pleaded for the boy . Mrs. Verotta flung herself upon her knees and added her entreaties . For a time Melchionne was obdurate . At last he dropped to $1,500 and Tor the first time the Verotta 's saw some hope . There was some haggling and finally the price came down to $1,000 , $900 , $700 and then $500 . " It shall be paid , " cried Verotta . " Now give me my boy . " " You pay me and the boy he come around the corner quick , " said Melchionne . The father insisted he did not have the money in the house and after demurring some time Melchionne finally contented to return.last night . Yesterday morning Verotta , intending in good faith to pay the ransom , went to the Franklin Savings Bank and drew out five $100 bills . Then he bethought himself of other helpless little children who might be snatched away by the band as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . He walked about , became convinced neither Melchionne nor any other strange person was watching him , and got in touch , with the Italian squad , which had led in the hunt for the child after a rpund-up of drug addicts and failed to yield a , clue . Melchionne came back late last evening . He found a stranger in the flat , a plumber , ' hard at work among a litter of pipes and tools in the bathroom . Verotta clpsed the bathroom door and assured his visitor there was no danger . " Here is the money , " he said , proffering the bills , " give me my boy . " " Pay me , " said Melchionne , " and within a few minutes after I am gone away the little fellow shall come running to you . I swear it . " Verotta handed over the $500 .

There were only a few seconds of that before the plumber came springing from the bathroom , an automatic pistol in his hand , a detective 's shield shining on his vest . Melchionne surrendered then . Meantime other members of the Italian squad had noted four , men lurking outside the house . Their avarice , coupled with their ' unwillingness to trust their emissary , led to their capture . They were ' seized after a fight in which the detectives used their blackjacks vigorously . It was Joseph Ruggiere , of 349 East Thirteenth Street , the detectives said , who yielded to a little pressure and confessed that he had written the letter received by Mrs. Verotta . The original letter received by Mrs. Verotta read : " Unless you place $2,500 in a shoe box and leave it outside the house for a man who will call at 9 A. M.

" Subsequently Verotta got a letter " which read : " You are a damn fool to notify the police . They can do nothing for you .

If you do n't give him the money a third letter ? will be sent to you which will tell the day and hour in which your boy will be killed and his body thrown into the East River . " POLUZZA . " The letter was written in Italian on white paper . According to Detective Fiaschetti , Poluzza in English means chief of the black handers .
