Mosque and State . The Angora Assembly has decreed the separation of mosque and state , and so the Caliph , successor to Mohammed and Haroun al Raschid , will no longer have any temporal power , such as his predecessors had . It was feared that the Moslems in India would object to this sudden move , but a congress of Moslem religious teachers in Calcutta has wired approval to Mustapha Kemal Pasha , calling him the " Renovator of the Caliphate , " and accepting the new status of the Caliph . The present Caliph 's " holy beard " has just reached the length required for sultans , and was blessed with appropriate ceremonies last week . <P> England . More than 500 clergymen of the Church of England , including many canons , have pledged their support to the Labor Party . For a long time the Church has felt keenly the reproach that the working classes were being alienated from it because they found no friends among the clergy . A congratulatory address was sent to Ramsey Macdonald and the Labor M. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever ways are open to us the effort you will assuredly make for the spiritual and economic emancipation of the people . " <P> Indianapolis . William Jennings Bryan has been officially appointed a delegate to the Presbyterian General Assembly . He may withdraw from the race for Moderator , because in the 133 conventions which the Church has held , only one layman has ever held this position . If Mr. Bryan withdraws , the conservatives will probably nominate Dr. Clarence Macartney , " father " of the now famous Philadelphia overture , in which the General Assembly was petitioned to remove Dr. Fosdick as special preacher at the First Church . The Assembly meets on May 17 . It can not try Dr. Fosdick for heresy , because he is a Baptist , and not subject to Presbyterian discipline . But it might force his removal . <P> The Saving Grace of humor is lacking in some very religious people , and thus absurd sects arise and flourish . Dr. Pollock , of Los Angeles , solemnly told radio fans last week that Zacharia 9:14 contains a prophecy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be seen over them , and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning . " ) He even more solemnly declared that the millenium is not far off , because the automobile has fulfilled the prophecy of Nahum 2:4 . ( " The chariots rage in the streets ; they rush to and fro in the broad ways ; the appearance of them is like torches , they run like lightnings . " ) <P> New York . According to figures from the office of the Presbytery of New York , there are 1,660 churches and synagogues in the city for 81 denominations : 1,948,000 Roman Catholics , 1,941,000 Protestants and 1,640,000 Jews .
