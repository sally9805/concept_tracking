In the beginning Rautendelein was just a pale , elfin creature who lived in a German wood at the bottom of a well . She was really no being at all , just a light , pagan spirit who kissed men 's eyes and made them well . And as such she came to Gerhart Hauptmann who put out his fingers swiftly and caught her for a play about a village bellcaster . <P> Hauptmann 's play begins in the forest with Rautendelein and three of her faery ilk ; Nickelmann , the old man of the well , all moss and weeds and dripping ; a witch whose herbs were powerless against humans , and a mischievous faun whose first prank was to push down into a lake the bell which had just been cast by a certain villager named Heinrich . This Heinrich , like his wife Magda , the schoolmaster , the barber , and the pastor , was a simple peasant . All his life he had worked on the bell to hang in the church tower-so long , so hard that , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart cracked too , would not mend until Rautendelein kissed him and took him with her into the forest . There , with new youth , new courage , he started a second bell , sang praises as he worked . But when the pastor found him , asked him what church the bell was for , he weirdly said " no church , " sang on , swearing that before he would leave Rautendelein the sunken bell would ring again . The sunken bell did ring and by the hand of Magda who drowned herself to ring it . Too deep the crack was then for even Rautendelein to heal . He cursed her , left her , came back to her and died , while she went back to the old Nickelmann who had wanted her all along . <P> Last week La Campana Sommersa , the music by Ottorino Respighi to a libretto by Claudio Guastalla taken from Hauptmann 's play , had its U. S. premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan . Rautendelein was still its inspiration , Heinrich still the heckled human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . But operatic singers , operatic trappings rarely enhance a poetic mood . Soprano Elisabeth Rethberg as Rautendelein managed her bulk skillfully , sang difficult music easily , spent clear high notes ' lavishly . But her appearance , her acting left little illusion . Nor could Giovanni Martinelli forget he was a tenor for the sake of the bellcaster . Dramatically it was Baritone Giuseppe de Luca in a minor role who served best . As Nickelmann he never once stepped out of the well , just poked up his moss-covered head , beat his webbed hands against the side . Yet when with a " Brekekekex " he lost Rautendelein , the audience was sorrier than it ever was for Heinrich . And it was happier for the " Brekekekex " that won her back than for any of her flawless cadenzas . <P> The composer had the ovation . A sturdy , middle-aged Italian , Respighi had come to the U. S. especially for the premiere . Only in Heaven , he announced after the general rehearsal , could one hope for so perfect a production as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return the compliment , called him again and again before the curtain . For critics The Sunken Bell was commendable , if unimportant , an opera to make one pleasant evening , if scarcely half a dozen .
