txt IN THE DRAMATIC MAILBAG Kind Words for the Guild Play --  " The Silver Tassie " Runneth ' Over In Praise of Rolland . To the Dramatic Editor : Your ' reviewer missed some of the beauty ' of- the Theatre . Guild 's production of Romain Rolland 's " Game of Love and Death . " Or perhaps I have only a different viewpoint . The basic elements of drama have not changed and can not be affected by what your reviewer calls " the shambles of Broadway . " Conflict has been ; from the time ' of the Greeks ; the means of holding " the mirror up to . , nature , " , conflicts of duty and emotions , conflicts of tetri peraments , conflicts of man in his unique personality against the social group . All.these are present in the Rolland play , and On ' the plane - of the spirit . They are a/so present the more earthy roll of the drums and marching of mobs . I agree with your critic that there is much rhetoric , but I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are noble ideas and thoughts in which there is a conflict of great sentiments , and in all of which men grope to find their place . The rhetoric is sustained and intensified by the mental conflict it covers and the physical presence and suggestion of mobs . It Is notable that your reviewer found the scene between Carnot and Courvoisierwhich is most rhetorical  --  one of the best . Taken on the basis of mental conflict , the action lapses when Vallee leaves , and therefore . I can not agree that the scene where husband and . wife sit down together while the guillotine creeps nearer is one of the best . This is the natural , inevitable conclusion and therefore anticipated . I do not find that the play may be more easily disposed of in one 's library . The Guild production has added not only something , but much . It develops and brings out the physical conflict that gives meaning and intensity to the spiritual conflict under the rhetoric which in the library might remain rhetoric , but which in this performance pulsates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . " The direction brings out the noble beauty of the play and the actors realize and project its dramatic beauty . If this might be better done we can only realize such a result by our encouragement . After all , Broadway is capable of great and noble drama which belongs not to one class but to all men and we do poor service to the cause of drama and men in speaking of narrow circles in such matters . PERLIE P. FALLON . New York , Nov. 26 , 1929 . O'Casey 's Play Again . To the Dramatic Editor : Such conflicting statements have appeared regarding American presentations , current and to come , of Sean O'Casey 's much-discussed drama , " The Silver Tassie , " it is but fair that the facts in the case should be told . When the Irish Theatre , avowedly. experimental , decided to " . open- , itS ' current season with " The Silver - Tass7r , sie " it was quite aware.that the:play had been refused by the Abbey The : - atre , Dublin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draniat ! st ! s : two former plays ) , and that " The Silver Tassie " had been in Mr. Cochran 's possessionfor some eighteen months unproduced. - Plainly Mr. Cochran did not have any high idea of its value up to the time the Irish Theatre in New York put it into rehearsal : ? " The Silver Tassie " was purchased through the Selwyn office for a period of-six weeks , the time planned for- the run of each of the Irish Theatre 's subscription productions , Arch Selwyn acting as Mr. Cochran 's New York representative . Mr. Selwyn was invited to assist in the production , his resources being larger than those commanded by the Irish Theatre , but he refused to be identified with the production . Then , while " The Silver Tassie " was in rehearsal , Mr. Cochran was notified in London that the play looked unexpectedly good . More than once Mr. Selwyn interrupted the director at rehearsal to suggest that the Irish Theatre waive the New York producing rights , which it had bought and paid for , and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cochran in London . Naturally the - Irish Theatre could not see that proposition . Having had the courage to select an untried  --  even a rejected ? play and stake the success of its coming season upon it . why abandon it for a mere suggestion , on some other man 's whim ? The opening date was set in the production contract . The play proved a more difficult undertaking than was anticipated ; and although in the opinion of the director further rehearsals were imperative , the Selwyn office insisted that the play open upon the contract date . Naturally , under such circumstances , the critics found cause for adverse comment , ? thus seriously marring the Irish Theatre 's chances of box-office success . However , several of the leading newspaper critics have been fair enough to pay a second visit , to state plainly and at length that they have found " The Silver Tassie " much improved from the opening night , and express a favorable opinion on it . As the matter stands , it looks as though Mr. Selwyn had used the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Irish Theatre paying well for the privilege . Had the play proved a failure , would we have heard . anything further from Mr. Selwyn ? That is the whole story . What was a doubtful theatrical experiment until the Irish Theatre courageously undertook to produce it now seems to be in the nature of a good box-office attraction ; and the Selwyn office is eager -- to take - whatever. credit  --  and cash  --  may accrue from I a following presentation . I trust- that you will publish this side of the matter , - in all fairness to the Irish Theatre . MICEAL BREA THNACH. - New York , Nov. 26 , 1929 . The ' London production of : " The Silver Tassie " ' opened Frank . To ' the Drunintic , Editor : ? In last Sunday 's TIMES I ' read an artiele , dealing'with the various trials and tribulations of casting five " Journey 's End " companies in ' the United States and Canada , and I noticed my- name as Charles Hearn . It is one thing to travel in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of nip ; TIMES as Charles . May I correct the impression that the Raleigh of the Southern edition of " Journey 's End " is Charles ? The name is Frank Hearn . FRANK HEARN . Louisville , Ky. , Nov. 23 , 19 ' 19 . The " Scandals " and Foreign Revues To the Dramatic Editor : In ' your issue of Oct. 27 a letter signed P. L. H. accuses George White of plagiarizing certain scenes used in his present production of " Scandals " and stresses particularly his seeming neglect in mentioning that these scenes were used in Paris previous to the New York production of " Scandals . " May I correct P. L. H. and point to the fact that the same designers employed by the Parisian ? producers have , for many years sold to ? Mr. White ideas , designs ' and creations ' that sometimes were first produced in " Scandals " ? Others appeared first in Paris and Berlin and in some cases were shown simultaneously here and abroad . As far as the " Bottoms Up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " photos will prove that there is not the slightest resemblance in architecture , action , music or color . The only foreign insertion is a group of mechanical jazz figures designed by a Spanish artist for both productions . As . to " La Belle et la Bate , " as well as all other foreign designs , due credit is given on the program , if P. L. H. will take the trouble of reading carefully . Taking the last scene in question , " La bain de la Parisienne , " the only similarity is that both French and American sets were inspired by certain under-water effects used in our own . Hippodrome some twenty years ago . Again . photos Will prove that there is no resemblance in color or design . In closing may I add that many of the " Scandals " effects and scenes created and first shown here by Mr. White in the past ten years have been " lifted bodily . " as P. L. H. puts it , by several of the European revues ? Furthermore , if it . interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . G. A. WEIDHAAS . Bronxville , N. Y. , Nov. 22 , 1929.
