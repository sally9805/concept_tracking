Many and ingenious are the devices by which labor unions provide work for strikers , hoping to outwit , outlast the resistance of employers . In New Bedford , Mass. , striking textile workers have turned fishermen ( TIME , Aug. 13 ) . In Milwaukee , Wis. , last week , striking clothing workers turned industrialists . <P> Since April 17 , 800 members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America have been on strike against David Adler &; Sons , Milwaukee garment makers , recent converts to nonunionism . Last week , strikers announced they would open a factory of their own , join the 12,000 makers and distributors of natty coats , pants and vests for Hart , Schaffner &; Marx . <P> But Laborleader Samuel Levin promised : " When the firm of David Adler &; Sons is willing to operate under ... civilized conditions ... the Amalgamated will liquidate this unit , cooperate in returning workers to their jobs .
