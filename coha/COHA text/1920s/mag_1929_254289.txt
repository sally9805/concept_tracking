Those Italians who went to the polls last week-and millions did not-had a choice of writing yes or no on ballots imprinted with the names of 400 men whom Signer Benito Mussolini favored as candidates for the Chamber of Deputies . No other candidates were permitted to exist . Had a majority of the electorate voted no , another election would have been held . But naturally the majority of ballots were yes . ballots . <P> " We despise votes cast with mental reservations ! " cried Il Duce in Rome on the day before election . " Nobody should delude himself that he will be able to place an eventual ephemeral lien on the future development of the regime through a handful of ballots , as the regime of tomorrow will be more of a totality than yesterday . " <P> Though the language of Orator Mussolini has seldom or never been more obscure , even fools perfectly caught the idea that this particular election was not going to be lost , nor was it .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
