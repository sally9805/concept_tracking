In Trades Union Hall , Moscow , a huge blood-red disc above the stage , bearing the Hammer and Sickle , emblems of Soviet Russia , was hung . A vast crowd surged- peasants in blouses , urban workers in tight , shoddy store clothes . They had come to hear the first public speech in four months by Russia 's greatest orator , famed Leon Trotzky . All knew that M. Trotzky had been silent perforce , following the crushing of his section of the Communist party by Dictator Josef Stalin ( TIME , Oct. 25 ) . When Comrade Trotzky slipped upon the stage last week , pale , wiry , magnetic , there was stamping , applause and cheers for 15 minutes-proof enough that Leon Trotzky is still great , though subservient to Dictator Stalin . <P> Choosing words carefully , avoiding internal politics , yet speaking with his wonted fire , Comrade Trotzky said : " The lands bordering the Pacific will be the scene of the world 's most important events . Europe does not relish this any more than it relishes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in the world , expanding northward through Canada and southward through Nicaragua . . . . <P> " We not only sympathize with the Chinese revolutionists , but , if we could , we would gladly drown in Shanghai waters all who intervene . " <P> Then referring to the recent British note of protest and warning to Russia ( TIME , March 7 ) he concluded : " It is not Britain who should have protested to us about anti-British propaganda , but we who should have protested to Britain about her anti-Soviet propaganda . The note complained that the Soviet press had caricatured Sir Austen Chamberlain as applauding the hanging of Lithuanian Communists . I say that he not only applauded , but also greased the ropes . "
