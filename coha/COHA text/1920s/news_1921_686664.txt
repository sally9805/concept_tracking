txt Blame for the World War was placed squarely on the shoulders of organized labor in Germany by President Samuel Gompers in an address ' to the American Federation of Labor convention here today . " I hold , and I accept full responsibility for what I am about to say , " said Mr. Gompers , " that the organized labor movement of Germany failed dismally at the critical hour . " If it had taken the situation in hand it might have meant the destruction of a few thousands , but it would have stopped the war . The failure of men to act at a time of crisis is faithlessness to a common cause . " In his address , which was a response to those of fraternal delegates from Great Britain and Canada , Mr. Gompers dwelt upon the attitude of the Federation and himself both during the war and since , during the period of reconstruction . In putting upon organized labor of Germany the blame for the war Mr. Gompers said : " I have nothing in my heart that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , toward the German labor movement , toward their attempt to conduct a great republican form of government . It can not be driven out of the minds of peoples who have lost young men of their flesh and blood , fallen in defense of this great common cause , to maintain some degree of a self-determination in a democratic form of government . Mistakes of a Democracy . " You know that the American labor movement has made its great contribution to the great cause , and you know also that I have titled to do my full duty in the critical circumstances in which we are all placed , and that at the peace table wisdom did not prevail . I think that most men who have given the subject thought quite agree with that judgment . But it is always hindsight that Ls so superior to foresight , and in the frame of mind in which the people were it is not difficult to understand that they wanted to penalize Germany in some way . " We know that the representatives of democracy make mistakes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have the right to make a mistake rather than to yield to the dictation of some Emperor , Kaiser or King . Lt we want democracy we must suffer the penalties for the mistakes democracies are subject to . " We have been with you and with all the allied democratic nations in the war , " said Mr. Gompers , addressing the fraternal delegates , " and for the extent of time that we were in it we made our full contribution . We have not done anything of which we find it necessary to boast , and we have no cause to hang . our heads in shame . " The pity of It all was that when the crucial time came there were some of those who had made flamboyant declarations ? who failed at the crucial hour . " Thomas Warns of Imaging ' . James H. Thomas , the British labor leader and President of the International Federation of Trade Unions , addressed the oonvention as a fraternal delegate from the British Trades Union Congress . Re told the American Federation that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any agitation in that direction that might dia-1 rupt the American labor movement " For one hundred years we in England have been confronted with the problem of Ireland , and if we at home can not solve that problem let me ask how do you , 3,000 miles away , expect to solve It ? " he said . " British labor has always stood and stands now for liberty , We stand for home rule for Ireland . " The only limitation we put is that we are not going to have Ireland made a menace for submarine warfare , Do n't assume , however , that the British labor movement stands for an independent republic , s ' Let me warn you against any agitation that might disrupt your movement here in America by creating differences among yourselves , Do not mistake me , British labor stands for Irish freedom the only liinitation we insist upon is that Ireland shall not be allowed to become a menace , ror one hundred years the people of Ireland have been deceived , For one hundred years they have been fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the Irish people are looking to you , I warn you against trying to ereate in their minds the feeling that you can &Ohre; their difficulties , Ton ca n't solve IT passing resolutions this problem that has existed for the past one hundred . years . " Mr. Thomas 's remarks immediately brought a response from Irish sympa. - thae. ers among the delegates who demanded the right to question him . ' After the British leader had answered several questions regarding the acts of the military in Ireland , Mr. Gompers stopped further debate . In answering Timothy Healy of New York , one of the leaders of the Irish sympathizers , Mr. Thomas said that " ' militarism may go on to doomsday , but it will not solve the Irish problem . " Says Nations Are Interdependent . At another point in his address : Mr. Thomas said : " No nation today can lock itself up in a water-tight compartment and isolate itself from the rest of the world and prosper . " Do not make the mistake that any iration of the world today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do not believe that it is possible for any country to isolate itself , to hold itself aloof from world affairs . Only a fool and ; fanatic would believe that . Today all nations of the world are dependent and interdependent upon each other . " Speaking of the international problems of the nations at war , Mr. Thomas said : There is no difference today in any part of the world with regard to the problems with which we are confronted and compelled to . face . The only differenee is a difference Of degree and - we today in America , in- Great Britain , France , in all the Central Powers , are suffering the inevitable price of haying lived a riotous life for six years . A nation pays the same price as an individual : if nature is abused , nature will exact her price . " The world is not suffering from overproduction , the British labor leader asserted , replying to reported arguments that workers do as little work as possible if they want to intn.ease their chances for employment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued , " everybody would have boots . clothes and comforts . Overproduction could be possible only when thenearld ! s requirements are adequately met . But , as a matter of told . hard fact , the world was never so poverty ridden as she is at this moment . ' Your goods are more required , at this moment than they ever were . There are more men and women bootless. mon- , withotit clothes , than ever in the historyof the world , and overproduction Is not the cause . it is underconsumption that ' i we are suffering from and not overproduction . ' Hopeful of Mine settlement . Success of the British coal miners ' OLT-Ike was predicted by Mr. Thomas . who declared that the miners had gone on strike " without a brass copper in their fund . " " They are still *tainting unbroken , - he added . m ? no man going hack. no *Cabs imported . I hope it will . soon be settled , and settled honorably. but whenever it is settled you may take it from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted by the . recognized Miners ' Trade Union . " America , France , Italy . and every power that was a party to the Peace Treaty must bear a share of the responsibility of the miners ' coal strike crisis , Mr. Thomas asserted . " I know it is an easy phrase to repudiate Governments . At our conventions in London I have frequently heard resolutions abusing them . You will have ' the same here . But . as a matter of fact , these are condemnations of yourselves , for the Government is only a reflection of your own intelligence . " The Peace Treany , which , he said . was designed " to make Germany pay . " gave dance 2,000,000 tons of German coal per month , and as a result " we woke up one morning in England and discovered the mines , which were taken over during the war and controlled by the Government , were losing f4,500,000 a zoOnth . ' ? " The Government in a panic : Reid . ? This is no good to us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit , but it is shocking bad business When we are making a loss , ' and they promptly gave notice to decontrol the Mines . " This action of the Government . asserted the speaker , resulted in the eventual closing down of the mines , as the owners were unable to pay a living wage to the workers . The labor leader said that his criticism of the treaty in regard to the disposition of the Ruhr coal deposits must not be construed as a " justification of Germany 's action in the war . " Says British and French Fay . Referring again to the framing of the peace treaty , Mr. Thomas said the net result of it was that it was n't Germany paying , it was the French and the British miner who paid . Mr- Thomas declared the " only cure " ' for war " is disarmament . " " You can not go on building armies and navies without leading either - to bankruptcy or explosion , " lie declared . Mr. Thomas , who is President of the International Federation of Trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what it teemed " revolutionary activities , " urged the labor movement to use the ballot and exercise its political power in bringing about reforms in government , instead of using bullets . " We in the labor movement prefer the ballot . " he said . We prefer the Constructional way because we know the bloody upheavals never bring Statesmen to the top , they merely and invariably bring the bullies . No. we want this sane way because we know it is the slow wan , the sure way , but it is the certain way . " The speaker denied press reports , which he said were due to the " imagination of your American press , " that he had come here t ' to preach internationalism , to preacli Bolshevism , to square a private deal with Lloyd George with regard to the coal situation , and , among other sins , I was here in order to render the position of your President more difficult because of some imagiinary opposition I was supposed to have against him . " W. F. Bush , fraternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . told the delegates that despite difficulties , organized labor in Canada was at feast holding its own . He reviewed the incipiency of the " one big union " movement and predicted " its early death . " A resolution was adopted by the convention urging Congress to pass immediately the Johnson bill providing for a Federal investigation into conditions in the Mingo County , W. Va. , strike zone . Irish Demand a sioyeote . Efforts to prevent a widening of the breach between the two factions of Irish sympathizers among the delegates were made today . Advocates of Irish freedom , it was learned , at a mans meeting last night appointed a committee which was attempting to draft a resolution that would be satisfactory to both the extreme and conservative groups of the assemblage . When this committee started to work T. J. Vinci of Chicago , Secretary of the Labor Bureau of the American Commission on Irish Independence , served notice that two " official resolutions on the Irish'Republic " must be incorporated In the resolutions ore'he would act independently in presenting the documents to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boycott not only on British-made goods , but on all products made by English capital , and the boycott of British insurance companies and similar . business organizations . They also provided that the Executive Council of the federation shall immediately compile a list of Englislr-made goods and firms backed by British capital and send it to every one of the members of organized labor in the Tinied States . Appointment of a. committee of three by the federation to co-operate with the British trade unions to bring pressure to bear on the English Government to recognize Ireland and withdraw troops from the country was also asked . Mr. Vind declared that the resolutions were drawn by " high officials of the Irish Republic , " but declined to state whether Eamonn de Valera , " President of the Irish Republic , " had taken part in their drawing . Others Demand Recognition . A lar/faction of the delegates have tennoune opposition to the " official resolutions , " and have presented to the committee a resolution demanding recognition of the Irish by the United States , withdrawal of British troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaned to her by the United States . Four other resolutions of similar character have also been submitted . The delegates opposing the boycott resolution declared that it would be detrimental to the labor movement and an affront to the members of the federation who are connected with local unions of Canade Any resolution embodying a boycott , they asserted , will be defeated on the floor of the convention . Despite the protest of supporters of the " official resolutions , " Irish sympathizers at the mass meeting declined to substitute them for all other resolutions . When Feter Brady of New York , who was presiding , asserted that Harry Boland , secretary for de Valera , had expressed a desire that the delegates decide upon their own resolution , Mr. Vind protested and asked that permission be granted to hear a " personal representative of ' dr . Boland or Frank P. - Walsh . " Thiq v-nuiri he granted in executive session , ' Mr. Brady said . In supporting the boycott resolution . Timothy Healy asserted that the Executive Council had failed to carry out the pronisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Montreal . He asked that the resolution be so worded as to force the ecuricil to take action this year . The Executive Council has not been on the sentare , " he said . " It has not done its duty .
