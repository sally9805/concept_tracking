A constant complaint of U.S. business against Washington in recent years has been the growing tendency toward regulation of industry . The present Administration has steadily opposed this tendency , however , not only because it is harmful to business itself , and to the public at large , but because it steadily increases the expenses of the Federal Government and thus prevents tax reduction . <P> Now the Chamber of Commerce has stepped into the breach with a constructive suggestion-that U.S. business regulate itself . At the National Distribution Conference to be held in Washington Dec. 15 , a definite plan will be introduced , discussed . The contention of the Chamber apparently is that self-government in business is more desirable that regulation by the State and will make the latter unnecessary . <P> In a survey made by a committee of the Chamber , a list of leading causes for unethical trade practices has been compiled . They include price fluctuations ; trade customs which have outgrown their justification ; " fly-by-night " business organizations ; changes in style ; discrimination among customers ; lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machinery for adjusting trade disputes . <P> To manage the difficult and extensive program which this list suggests , the Chamber proposes that a joint Trade Relations Committee be organized , composed equally of producers and distributors , to act as a clearing house for charges of trade abuses , to study existing trade abuses and their supposed preventives , to promote settlement of disputes , and to eliminate business wastes by producers and distributors .
