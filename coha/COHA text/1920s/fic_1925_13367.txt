SCENE .  --  An old house , a short way out of Philadelphia . The room is mellow with age and fine taste , and there is a subdued glowing under the sheen of the old woods and brasses that is felt rather than seen . The same restrained beauty is in the woman who sits in one of the charming chairs , waiting tensely , with long delicate hands clasped in unresigned resignation . The room has never quite let go  --  never flowed into the abandon of luxury and sensuous comfort , and the woman who has lived in it has the same subdued gleam that might have been radiant had she let the inner spark burn . Her brother , much like her outwardly , but hardened into middle age with a fine hard polish which has no regrets and no doubts of its own fineness . ( As the curtain rises he is pacing the room with long strides which indicate an aggrieved and superior irritation that anything should keep him waiting . ) WORTHINGTON I 've been foolish enough to think that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this , some of them might have done what I asked . ANGELINE ( in a voice whose sweetness and steadiness control its unfulfilled longings ) . Busy people do n't realize what waiting means to people like us . WORTHINGTON Busy people ? They 're only busy with their own self-importance. p. 3 ANGELINE There 's a train from New York every hour , is n't there ? WORTHINGTON Certainly . ANGELINE They 're sure to be here on the next one . WORTHINGTON And there 's no excuse under heaven for Harriette . There 's a train out from Philadelphia every thirty minutes . I tried to impress them with the necessity of getting here before the woman herself does  --  but I might as well try to impress the wind as Harriette , and Laurence would make a point of being late to show me how much better he can handle the thing than I can . ANGELINE Oh , no , something has detained him . WORTHINGTON He should n't have allowed anything to detain him . If we let her slip through our fingers this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's only the diplomacy of my letters that has got her now . She 's curious and ready to listen . She wants to hear what I have to say . ANGELINE I hope so . ( Looking at the tall clock . ) But it is late . Oh , there 's a motor . ( She braces herself without rising . Worthington stops walking , but does not go to the door . A motor is heard on the gravel beyond the low veranda , after a moment a quick assertive step , and Harriette appears in full sail , a tall , long-lined woman who has made so much of her good points that she seems handsome. ) p. 4 WORTHINGTON ( going on with his walk ) . Oh , it 's only Harriette . HARRIETTE ( as she comes through the open door ) . I 'm not late , am I ? Where are the others ? Do n't tell me I 'm the only one here . That 's maddening . I could have stayed longer . I ran away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive up ? HARRIETTE Of course . I motored out . Mrs. Rittenhouse gave me her car . She is so sweet about it . I almost feel as though it were mine now . What 's the matter , Angeline , you look as if you had a cramp . You 're nervous , of course  --  so am I  --  horribly  --  but do n't be . She 'll give up . If you 'll just let me do the talking , Worthington  --  I know better than any of you what to say  --  and I have a better right than any of you to ask what we 're going to ask . ( She has seated herself on a long sofa and more or less filled that side of the room with her personality and her effects  --  her gloves one place . her purse and trinkets another . She makes a critical and satisfied inspection of her complexion in a small mirror , and the extremely long earrings bob and vibrate , adding to her all-pervading , all-embracing restlessness. ) p. 5 WORTHINGTON The best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll irritate  --  HARRIETTE Yes , of course you think you 're the one to talk . What can you say that has any weight at all ? Here you are  --  you and Angeline  --  an old maid and an old bachelor  --  with just barely so much money . How can you ask for the child ? What do you want with him , anyway ? What would you do with him if you  --  ANGELINE But it does n't matter who has him  --  just so we get him . That can be settled afterward . HARRIETTE Oh , but it does matter  --  and it 's my case and my argument that will get him . I 'm married and have no children . Obviously , I 'm the one to have my brother 's child . Who else ? Laurence has more children now than he knows what to do with . If all of you will only see that , and throw your weight on my side , we 'll  --  ANGELINE ( rising and going towards the outer door ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . Now , do keep cool and do n't lose your heads . Sit down , Angeline . Do n't let her think you 're  --  Oh , Lord , it 's Laurence and Amy ! Why on earth did he bring Amy ? She 'll ruin it if she sticks in . Actually she gets a bigger fool every year , and I positively believe she 's going to have another baby . It 's disgraceful . p. 6 ANGELINE Careful ! They 'll hear you . Come in , Amy dear . Come in , Laurence . LAURENCE ( who is short and thick and therefore obliged to add to his height by a tall manner ) . Is she here ? HARRIETTE She is n't , but I am . Hello , Laurence . Hello , Amy . LAURENCE How are you , Harriette ? ( Nodding to Harriette and shaking hands with Angeline and Worthington . ) AMY ( trailing in limply after Laurence ) . Oh , hello , Harriette dear . Hello , Angeline dear . ( Amy kisses the two women with fussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock of her dull hair where it will not stay . ) ANGELINE Was n't there any  --  Was n't she on that train ? LAURENCE I did n't see anybody get off . ANGELINE Send the car right back to the station , Worthington . She 'll surely be on the next one . ( Worthington goes out on the veranda to give the direction . ) HARRIETTE ( still on the sofa ) . Your hat 's crooked , Amy , and why did you get another drab one ? And a hairpin 's coming out . Laurence , I say if you 'll only let me do the talking , I know just how to approach  --  p. 7 LAURENCE And if you 'll only keep still , Harriette , that 's the best thing you can do . It 's got to be handled in a businesslike  --  HARRIETTE Of course that 's what you would say . Business has nothing to do with the case . It 's going to take tact and a great deal of finesse and cleverness . Now wait , wait  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't come over here to hear you talk , Harriette . Worthington , listen to me . ( As Worthington comes back from the veranda . ) I tell you this thing has got to be tackled from a legal standpoint . ( Sitting rigidly and legally by a table . ) HARRIETTE Slush ! WORTHINGTON I do n't see that there 's anything legal about it . ( Angeline stands anxiously by the open door , looking out . Worthington moves about a little  --  restlessly . ) HARRIETTE Of course there is n't . It 's going to take tact  --  tact  --  and a great deal of insight and intuition , which neither of you has a drop of in your  --  WORTHINGTON Oh , bosh , Harriette ! It 's the justice and fitness of things that have to be  --  p. 8 HARRIETTE Much she cares about justice and fitness ! She 's a  --  a something you people do n't know anything about . Harry saw her dance in New York last week and she 's perfectly  --  LAURENCE Now let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No voice in it at  --  HARRIETTE He does n't want to have , and he had the good taste to stay away . He knows the in-laws have nothing to say whatever . ( Raising her chin at Amy . ) AMY ( whimpering ) . I only came for the trip  --  for a little outing . I 'm so tired , I  --  LAURENCE That will do , Amy . I tell you , I 've got to get at it from a legal  --  ( Bringing his fist down on the table . ) HARRIETTE Now wait till I finish  --  just once , Laurence , please , if you can let somebody else say something . ANGELINE Go on , Harriette , do . HARRIETTE Harry saw her , as I say , and she 's perfectly marvellous . And he says we 're fools not to take her up  --  recognize her while she 's a success . People are mad about her , you know . p. 9 ANGELINE Take her up ? What do you mean ? ( Turning back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( There is a quick protest from them all . ) Now wait  --  make it smart to know her  --  so people ca n't say we 're ashamed of her . That 's the only thing in the world that will flatter her . She wo n't care anything about any money we could put up . She can get money easily enough , you know . She 's had several fortunes spent on her already . AMY Oh , my ! What are we going to call her ? HARRIETTE Peggy , of course . Why not ? That 's what everybody else calls her . WORTHINGTON Just avoid calling her anything . I refuse absolutely to know her at all  --  except for the necessity of this interview . LAURENCE Certainly . If you begin muddling it with personal stuff , Harriette , there 'll be no end to it . She has no legal  --  WORTHINGTON I 'm not so sure about that . If she 's got anything in writing to show that Dan gave the child to her  --  AMY Oh , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own flesh and blood to a woman like that ! p. 10 HARRIETTE A woman like that ! Do n't be a ninny , Amy . Of course he gave her everything he had . She 's just the kind men do give everything to . And , after all , he did marry her . Do n't forget that . ANGELINE Of course he married her . I do n't believe there was ever anything else . ( Sitting again . ) HARRIETTE Oh , piffle , Angeline ! Wake up . Wake up . ANGELINE After all , she is his stepmother , and we would n't have dreamed of taking him away from his own mother . AMY Of course not  --  his own mother was a lady . HARRIETTE Yes , she certainly was  --  a lady and a fish . You know , I never did blame Dan in my heart of hearts for swinging to the other extreme after his years with Laura . Now , see here , I wo n't mind knowing this woman , Peggy  --  you know . I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me alone , I 'll get him away from her in my own way . Now , wait  --  please . ( As they all protest again . ) Harry 's father has always been perfectly rabid on the children business . He has n't given us a cent for years , and if I took this child  --  a real Raymond  --  it would be the next thing to having one of my own , and the old gent would thaw . I know it . p. 11 AMY Oh , my ! WORTHINGTON Looking out for your own interests , of course , Harriette . What about us  --  Angeline and me ? LAURENCE Well , if I may be allowed to say something  --  after all , I 'm the head of the family . That 's what you all seem to have forgotten entirely . HARRIETTE Oh , no , you never let us forget that , Laurence dear . LAURENCE Are you going to begin again ? HARRIETTE Oh , no  --  no  --  go on  --  go on . LAURENCE I want a boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to produce anything but girls , and  --  AMY Oh , Laurie , you know you would n't exchange our five dear little girls for all the boys in the world . LAURENCE I did n't say anything about exchanging them . Now , see here , I 'm prepared to put up more than the rest of you . HARRIETTE Then that 's taking a mean advantage of me . Money is n't everything , and I have social position to give him . That means more than all the  --  WORTHINGTON Poppycock ! This is the place for him . This is the old home where Dan would have wanted him to be . p. 12 LAURENCE Dan would have wanted him to be in New York and be brought up like a man . I know well enough what Dan wanted ! ANGELINE Dan evidently wanted her to have him . That 's what we have n't taken into consideration at all . ( They all speak at once in voluble protest at this , their voices rising . Angeline suddenly hushes them ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway with a boy of ten , whom she holds tightly by one hand . They are not able to speak to her at once , but stare at her , because of the warm magnetism of her lithe body , her white throat and the red hair  --  a strong irresistible force by which they are checked , and which they instinctively resent . ) ANGELINE ( rising and going a little towards the woman ) . Are you  --  PEGGY ( in a warm throaty voice ) . I 'm Mrs. Dan Raymond . AMY Why , how little Dannie 's grown ! ( She pounces upon the boy and draws him into the room . The others surround him , all talking at once . ) HARRIETTE I 'm your Aunt Harriette . You remember me , do n't you , dearest ? p. 13 AMY And I 'm your Aunt Amy , Dannie dear . HARRIETTE Oh , do n't call him Dannie ! AMY Would n't you like to come and live with me and be a big brother to my five little girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand ) . Keep still , Amy . How are you , boy ? I 'm your Uncle Laurence . I live in New York . You remember me , of course , do n't you ? WORTHINGTON And I 'm your Uncle Worthington . This is where you used to come and stay when you were a baby . Remember ? RAYMOND Peggy ! ( He calls to her sharply , and , pushing away from the others , goes back to her side , standing a little back of her and holding her arm . A flash of pride and satisfaction softens her face , and she throws a protecting arm about him . ) ANGELINE Did you  --  did the chauffeur find you ? We sent the car . PEGGY We walked . Nobody seemed to be looking for us . ANGELINE Oh , I 'm so sorry . Sit over here , wo n't you ? PEGGY ( moving to the chair with rather insolent grace ) . I ca n't stay long . I have to get back , you know . ( Dan goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hoped you might stay over . At least , I did . So we 'd get to know you and see how you  --  how you feel about things , you know . You will stay , wo n't you ? ( Sitting near Peggy . ) PEGGY ( with a very keen look at Harriette ) . I 'm working , you know . HARRIETTE Dancing , you mean . My husband saw you last week in New York , and he says you 're perfectly marvellous . I say he says you 're marvel-lous ! ( Peggy does n't seem to hear this but she watches them all with probing eyes . These eyes are smuggy and blue , and under their suspicion and hardness is a very great wistfulness and fear . ) ANGELINE Sha n't we have some tea ? You must be tired . PEGGY No , thanks . LAURENCE No , no , I 'm sure she wants us to be as businesslike as possible and get at things . WORTHINGTON As I wrote you , I have something of very great value to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAURENCE What I have to present is a very definite proposition . It 's this way  --  p. 15 PEGGY It 's about Dan  --  little Dan , is n't it ? ( There is a pause . Laurence clears his throat and lifting a chair places it before Peggy and sits with an air of being about to settle all unsettled things . ) LAURENCE He must be a great burden to you . We want to relieve you of that . AMY ( sitting on the edge of a chair and peering curiously at Peggy ) . Yes , that 's it , Laurie . PEGGY What ? WORTHINGTON Now , let me explain . We do n't expect you to be entirely disinterested . ( Moving closer to Peggy . ) HARRIETTE Oh , but there 's so much more than money to be considered . When I think of what I can give him , money seems horribly  --  WORTHINGTON The child has inherited something vastly more important than money . I wondered if you would n't see that , if you came here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the  --  the fineness of his inheritance . PEGGY ( some of the hardness and suspicion relaxing and the wistfulness increasing ) . Yes , I do want him to have it . That 's why I came . I want him to have what belongs to him , and what you people can give him . Oh , I can take care of him . That is n't it . It 's the other things  --  that are his  --  that I do n't want him to lose because of  --  of me. p. 16 LAURENCE ( relieved and jerking his chair closer to Peggy ) . Oh , well , then that 's very good . We did n't know just what your attitude would be . PEGGY ( speaking slowly and nervously but with great simplicity and honesty  --  rolling her handkerchief into a tight little ball in one hand ) . No , I s'pose not . While Dan was alive I never thought anything about you . He had enough of all this you 're talking about  --  to give little Dan . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about what the boy would n't have now  --  without his father  --  and  --  and when I got your letter I decided to let  --  Well , I said , if they 've held out a friendly hand , I must take it  --  for the boy 's sake  --  not for mine  --  mind you . I do n't want any of this  --  but I 'm perfectly willing to let you see Dan some  --  to even let him come and visit you just so often . I mean , regularly , you know  --  and for you to pick out his school and that kind of thing  --  and I 'm doing it  --  not just for the boy  --  but for Dan . That 's what I owe to him  --  and I 'll go through with it . ( The thing that breaks her voice and comes into her face is so startling that Angeline lowers her head and even the others turn their eyes away . Dan leans more closely against Peggy. ) p. 17 LAURENCE ( after a pause ) . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . We thought he might be a burden to you ; but if you 're willing to give him up for his own sake , why that 's so much the better . PEGGY Give him up ? HARRIETTE Oh , now , if he came to me , I would n't insist upon that  --  absolutely . LAURENCE There could n't be any going back and forth . That 's impossible . It 's  --  The two things would n't go together at all . PEGGY ( something ugly coming into a corner of her mouth ) . Oh , you do n't want any of him then ? LAURENCE Do n't misunderstand me . We mean for his sake he would have to be under our care entirely  --  come to us entirely . HARRIETTE Now , Laurence , I tell you  --  WORTHINGTON Do n't , Harriette . ( To Peggy . ) Of course , you know as well as we do the two a  --  atmospheres could n't be mixed . It  --  a  --  a child has to have one thing or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it must be . This house is  --  as I say , his inheritance  --  his birthright  --  his place where he belongs . p. 18 PEGGY ( holding Dan a little tighter ) . What do you mean ? HARRIETTE You want him to have it . You 've said that yourself . You 've been splendid . PEGGY Are you trying to tell me you want me to give him up ? Entirely ? To you ? ( Looking at all of them . ) LAURENCE Of course we do n't expect you to be entirely disinterested . I 'm prepared to be fair . I 'm prepared to  --  name a sum that will make you willing to set aside all claims to him whatsoever . PEGGY I do n't seem to understand . LAURENCE I 'm prepared to say twenty-five thousand dollars  --  outright  --  if he comes to me  --  with all claims relinquished . PEGGY God ! ( She rises with a quick movement . ) God , I was a fool to come ! Dan always said I was soft . LAURENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no legal claim to him , you know . WORTHINGTON None whatsoever . He 's ours . PEGGY Listen ! You cut Dan out entirely when he married me  --  and now I 'm going to cut you out . You ca n't see little Dan again . You ca n't write to him  --  you ca n't get at him  --  any way . Dan gave him to me  --  not because he had to  --  but because he wanted me to have him  --  not you . p. 19 LAURENCE We want to settle this without the law if we can , but we 'll  --  PEGGY He gave him to me , I tell you . He saw me with him for three years  --  and he wanted him to be with me . He wanted it ! Do n't be afraid , Dan , they 're not going to get you . They 're trying to buy you for twenty-five thousand dollars . It 's a joke . Come on . We 'll go . ( Going to the door . ) AMY ( beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Poor child ! PEGGY ( turning back to them at the door ) . Poor child ? Do you think I 'd leave him here ? Not for all the money the whole Raymond tribe could raise . Come on . ( Their anger and their egos and their wills are now united in their common cause against her . They move towards her  --  all speaking at once  --  except Angeline , who stands aside watching . ) PEGGY ( raising her voice above the excitement of theirs ) . There 's one of you  --  Angeline  --  is that you ? Dan always wanted me to see you  --  and I 'd like to speak to you a minute . We 'll go just in a minute , Dan . Do n't be afraid . ( Clutching Dan who has stayed close to her. ) p. 20 ANGELINE Will you come into the library ? WORTHINGTON No  --  no  --  stay here . We 'll go . I hope you know what to say , Angeline . Do n't let her browbeat you . ( Worthington , Laurence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arguing as they move . Worthington closes the door heavily . ) RAYMOND ( who has been watching Angeline most of the time ) . Are you my Aunt Angeline ? ANGELINE ( flushing with surprise ) . Yes . RAYMOND Dad said if I ever saw you to give you a kiss for him . ANGELINE Oh ! ( Dan kisses her cheek . She throws her arms about him and hides her face on his breast . Peggy turns to the window , brushing away the tears that suddenly swim in her eyes . ) Did he ? Did he do that ? RAYMOND Yes , and he said to tell you he loved you . PEGGY ( standing at the window with her back to the others ) . And did n't blame you for anything . ANGELINE I 'm glad you told me that . ( Putting a timid , hungry hand on his head. ) p. 21 RAYMOND Is this the house where my father lived when he was a little boy ? ANGELINE Yes . RAYMOND Like me ? ANGELINE Yes . So like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't tell you . RAYMOND ( slowly looking around the room ) . Did he play in this room ? ANGELINE Yes , dear  --  in this very room . Some of his books are over there , and I have lots and lots of his toys put away . RAYMOND Could n't I see ' em ? ANGELINE I 'll send them to you . RAYMOND Why could n't I see ' em now ? PEGGY ( turning quickly ) . Oh , no , Dan  --  not now . RAYMOND Was that his ? ( Pointing to a sword on the wall . ) ANGELINE That was his great-grandfather 's . RAYMOND Can I have it ? PEGGY No , Dan ! ANGELINE I 'd like you to have it . p. 22 PEGGY ( coming away from the window ) . Dan , you skip outside and pick some of those flowers for us to take back with us . I want to speak to this lady for a minute . RAYMOND She 's my Aunt Angeline . PEGGY Yes , I know , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run along . I 'll call you in a minute . ANGELINE Pick all you want , dear . All you can carry . ( Angeline puts out a hand to him . He takes it firmly and walks with her to the outer door . Peggy is not at all unaware of the pride and beauty of the two figures as they walk together , and of the poignant things which reach out to Dan from the room . Angeline lets him go and stands watching him as he crosses the grass . ) PEGGY The thing I wanted to tell you was this . ANGELINE ( turning back to her ) . Yes ? PEGGY He talked a lot about you . He always said he did n't give a damn about the others , not a tinker 's dam , but he wanted me to know you . And then towards the last  --  when he  --  knew he was going  --  he wanted to see you . He never said so  --  but I knew it . I could have sent for you and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dan . You 've heard plenty of things about me  --  some of them are true and some of them are n't , but Dan knew  --  and he was happy . I made him happy , I tell you , and we lived  --  and I 'm not going to give his boy back to these cold-blooded snobs . Why should I ? Little Dan loves me . I 'm working for him  --  I 'm living for him . He 's big Dan now . I  --  there is n't anything else on earth that cuts any ice at all with me now but him . They have n't got anything like that to give him  --  now , have they ? All the aristocracy in the world ca n't do what love can . Now , can it ? Their claims do n't mean anything beside mine  --  do they ? I love him , you know  --  that 's what I want to get to you  --  and nothing else matters , does it ? You have n't put in any claim for him . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? ( Angeline lowers her eyes . ) Oh  --  you do ? ( Slipping into a chair mechanically . ) You 're in it , too  --  are you ? You are all alike , then  --  after all . And what have you got to offer ? What do you put up for him ? p. 23 ANGELINE ( moving a chair and sitting close to Peggy ) . I have love , too . PEGGY You make me laugh . You 've got a kind of family pride , I s'pose , that would like to have him  --  but nothing that would keep him close  --  like me  --  like me . You do n't know what my kind of love is . Ca n't you understand that ? ANGELINE And what is your kind of love ? PEGGY What is it ? ANGELINE Is it great enough to do the best thing for him  --  no matter how much it hurts you ? PEGGY You need n't try to talk that to me  --  sacrifice . I do n't believe in it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing it loves  --  and makes it happy . Love does n't give up . ANGELINE I think it sometimes does . PEGGY What ? ANGELINE I could give him up to you if I were sure it were right for him . PEGGY Oh  --  you are what Dan said . That 's big . ANGELINE Oh , no , it is n't . I love him and I want him to have what he loves . p. 24 PEGGY And I 'll keep him loving me . Do n't be afraid . You can trust me . You see , you could n't love him the way I do , because you 've never had him . You have n't so much to give him as I have . ANGELINE Do n't you think I have ? PEGGY I know you have n't ; you could n't have , you 've been here so long  --  alone  --  proud and quiet , with nothing to hurt you . You 're still  --  and beautiful and  --  and perfect  --  but you have n't lived . It 's when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and down and hurt  --  and then find something to love  --  that you know what love means . Do n't you see , I 'll put into Dan all the best of everything that the worst has taught me . I know  --  I know what life is , and what 's worth hanging on to . Do n't you see ? I have so much more to give him than you have . ANGELINE But I have all I have n't given . And all I 've wanted to give all my life . PEGGY Oh , but  --  he needs  --  he 's like big Dan  --  he needs the sun . He 'd die without it . I 'm not all I 'd  --  I 'd like him to have . I 'm not kidding myself  --  not a little bit  --  but do n't you see  --  how lonely he 'd be here ? Do n't you see how empty  --  how cold you 'd seem to him ? ( The two women bend towards each other , speaking in low tones , each unbaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a crisis. ) p. 25 ANGELINE But you do n't know how warm the coldness would become for him . You do n't know how the emptiness would overflow  --  for him . Perhaps my love is stronger than yours because it never has had him . All that has never been given to anyone I 'd give to him . PEGGY ( rising ) . Never ! You ca n't have him . I 'll never  --  never  --  never give him up . ANGELINE And are you keeping him for his sake or for your own ? PEGGY He 's mine . Why should n't I keep him ? Come in , Dan . Come in and say good-bye . We 're going now . ( Going to the door to call him . ) ANGELINE ( rising quickly ) . But you ca n't take him away from us like this  --  and never let us see him again . They have a right  --  all of them . PEGGY They have n't . They do n't love him . They just want him because they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must all give up something . PEGGY I was ready to , but they  --  ANGELINE I know  --  I know  --  but they must . Wait  --  just a minute . I 'll speak to them . They must give up something . p. 26 PEGGY All right , ask them . They wo n't . The way to test their love is through their pocket-books . They said twenty-five thousand . Ask them what they say to a hundred thousand . Go on  --  ask them that and see how much they love him . Go on  --  I 'll wait . ANGELINE You will wait  --  wo n't you ? PEGGY I will . Angeline hurries out . RAYMOND ( coming back into the room ) . What 's the matter , Peggy ? PEGGY Nothing , honey . Do n't you be afraid . Nothing 's going to hurt you . RAYMOND Why do n't we have flowers like these ? ( Showing her the stiff bunch of flowers he holds tightly in his little hot hand . ) PEGGY I 'll buy you all the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEGGY Do you ? RAYMOND Why do n't we live in this house , Peggy ? PEGGY Un ? ( Peggy is watching the door through which Angeline went. ) p. 27 RAYMOND She said we could . Aunt Angeline says this is my father 's house . PEGGY ( looking at him sharply ) . Un ? Oh , no , she did n't . She did n't say that , dear . RAYMOND She said he lived here when he was a little boy . Why do n't we live here ? PEGGY We could n't . RAYMOND I 'd like to . PEGGY But you would n't want to stay here . You like to move  --  and travel  --  and see things . Just think , where you 've been , old man , and what you 've seen . Not many boys as little as you have seen the things you have , I tell you , and lived in the grand hotels . ( His eyes slowly take in the room again . Peggy turns him to her quickly . ) Do you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEGGY As much as me , Dan ? As much as me ? RAYMOND Ho-o ! I love you ! PEGGY How much , Dan ? How much ? RAYMOND Fifty bushels . ( She catches him to her ; he gives her a bear-like hug and releases himself . ) Could n't I have that now ? ( Pointing to the sword. ) p. 28 PEGGY No . RAYMOND Who 's going to have it if I do n't , Peggy ? PEGGY I do n't know . RAYMOND Have they got any little boys ? PEGGY No . RAYMOND Did n't they say I could have this house if I 'd come and live here ? PEGGY Why do you want it , Dan ? Why do you want it ? RAYMOND Because it 's mine . Why do n't we live in it , Peggy ? PEGGY They do n't want me . RAYMOND I do . I 'd let you live in it , Peggy . ( Her hot tears are falling unchecked ; she puts her cheek against his hair . ) PEGGY Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in this house . PEGGY ( lifting her head quickly ) . What ? When ? When did he say that ? RAYMOND Lots of times . He said he lived in it , and his father lived in it  --  and he wanted my little boy to live in it . Do n't you want me to , Peggy ? p. 29 PEGGY No . RAYMOND Why not , Peggy ? I like it better than any place I ever saw . PEGGY Oh , God , Dan  --  do n't say that . Would you like to stay here without me ? RAYMOND No . PEGGY We 'll go , then , in a minute . RAYMOND No , Peggy , I want to stay . I 'm the only little boy there is to live here . My little boy would n't like it if he is n't here . I have to be here so 's he can have it . I have to give it to my little boy so he can give it to his little boy . Please stay , Peggy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , listen , honey . You see I ca n't stay just now  --  but you can . RAYMOND Oh ! PEGGY Listen , I have to get back because I go on at nine o'clock , and old Craps would give me hell if I was n't there  --  would n't he ? But you can stay , and  --  and make Aunt Angeline a little visit . Wo n't that be nice ? Just a little one , you know , and see how you like it . Dan  --  if you  --  if you ever think I did a mean thing to you  --  you tell your little boy some day that  --  I wanted him to live in this  --  p. 30 RAYMOND What 's the matter , Peggy ? PEGGY Nothing , darling . RAYMOND Yes , there is . Do n't cry , Peggy . PEGGY I wo n't . Here , you see , I have to beat it or I 'll  --  I want to write a note to your Aunt Angeline , and tell her about it , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writes rapidly . ) There , honey , you give that to her  --  not to anyone else . ( Folding it in a small bit and thrusting it into his hand . ) Now I 've got to hurry . Good-bye , dear , you stay right there and wait for her . RAYMOND I want you to stay , too , Peggy . PEGGY Oh , do you , sweetheart  --  do you ? I  --  well  --  I  --  you  --  good-bye , honey . I have to hur  --  good-b  --  ( There are no tears now , but a deep pallor has come into her face . She gives him a long look , goes swiftly to the door , and with a limp wave of her hand , is gone . ) RAYMOND ( calling ) . Good-bye , Peggy . You come back to-morrow . ( He stands quite still looking after her . The voices of the others are heard as they come back into the room. ) p. 31 ANGELINE Where is she ? RAYMOND Peggy told me to give this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeline . She reads it . The paper flutters to the floor . She kneels beside Dan , taking his hands with a reverent tenderness . The others are hushed  --  in the presence of something greater than themselves . ) ( END OF PLAY )
