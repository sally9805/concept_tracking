txt A spirit of depression settled upon this city today as positive news continued lacking of the Dole flight planes Miss Doran and Golden Eagle and the four men and one young and pretty girl they bore away from Oakland , Cal. , Tuesday , in the great race to Hawaii over 2,400 miles of licean . The joyous welcome was stilled to Art Goebel and Lieutenant W. V. Davis of the Woolaroc and Martin Jensen and Paul Schluter of the Aloha , who landed from the skies yesterday afternoon to win first and second prizes in the Dole contest . The naval tug Sunnadin and the mine sweeper Pelican started back over the course the planes should have followed , one patroling fifteen miles north and the other five miles south of the great circle route used by shipping to the mainland . They will continue the hunt for the planes until it is necessary to return to Pearl Harbor to replenish provisions and fuel . Meanwhile the intensive naval patrol continued in waters off the Hawaiian Islands . Celebrations are Postponed . All celebrations and joyous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aloha planes were ended , or postponed until the safety of the missing fliers was assured . The city 's attitude was one of extreme anxiety , sympathy and hurt surprise , it having been felt generally that complete preparations , inspections and examinations virtually had eliminated the possibility of tragedy . Goebel and Jensen were more concerned for the safety of the other contestants than joyous in victory , and announced plans to fly their machines in the search . Goebel said that he and his navigator would take off in the Woolaroc as soon as they coull put her into the air , and would fly the machine a hundred miles in every direction from Wheeler Field in the endeavor to locate the Golden Eagle and the Miss Doran . The Woolaroc was ordered refueled hastily , and Goebel departed with Davis for the field . Jensen and his navigator prepared to join the search with their plane , the Aloha . Goebel said that he would not fly back to the mainland . He made arrangements to ship the Woolaroc to San Francisco next week . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the winner of the first prize . " I wanted to fly . back after I had rested a few days , but my backers at Hollywood did not approve of the plan . " Faith in himself as pilot , in the ability of the navigator , Lieutenant Davis , in the monoplane Woolaroc , and especially in the army radio beacon , prompted Goebel to favor returning to California in the airplane . " It is entirely feasible to fly back , but I shall have to abide by the decision of my backers , " he said regretfully . Malloska Fears Fire on Plane . Unshaven , eyes filled with tears , his trembling hands revealing his anxiety , William F. Malloska , backer of the Miss Doran plane , still declared his belief that the plane and its crew might be found momentarily . In a husky voice , he said : " I tell you it makes a man feel queer , this thing does . Yesterday just knowing you would see the plane come in with the rest  --  andnow , " he paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to prevent them from being picked up some place , " M. Malloska resumed . " That is , if the plane caught fire . Yes , they carried fire extinguishers . But if that happened , some one would have heard of it , so we can go on waiting hopefully . " Malloska asserted his belief that the crew was afloat at sea , admitting that the plane 's gasoline must be exhausted . He declined to hazard a guess whether the crew would be found nearer to the islands or the mainland , saying that either might be possible . " That boat ca n't sink , " he declared with emphasis . " It can float for- ever . The plane was especially designed for such an emergency . It is a land plane , but built to float . " A report , unverified , that an object resembling a plane had been seen floating eight miles off Honoipu . Island of Hawaii . caused the navy station at Pearl Harbor to dispatch vessels to investigate . They were actuated by the intention to neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rescue of the missing fliers . From the neighboring island of Molokai came the report that opinion was unanimous among residents there that the missing planes could not have landed on that island without being observed . Lookouts had kept constant vigil from early Wednesday , but had sighted neither plane . The United States Lighthouse Service joined the search for the missing planes . Ralph E. Tinkharn , Superintendent of the lighthouse tender Kukui. was ordered to keep a continuous watch . The Kukui , at present on a construction trip around the Hawaiian Islands , was off the north coast of Lanai this morning , and was expected off the southwest coast of Molokai Island later in the day . The ship carried wireless . One hundred and twenty sampans belonging to members c : the Japanese Fishermen 's Association were ordered out from Oahu Island . Large numbers of sampans are expected to operate from other islands also in supplementing naval and civilian efforts . Inspection of the Woolaroc 's gasoline tanks showed the plane could have traveled about seven more hours after its flight from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons remained in the tanks . The Aloha , aviators said , had about an hour 's gasoline supply left .
