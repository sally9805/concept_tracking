txt The Ford " flivver " airplane in which Harry Brooks , while on the way to Miami , fell into the sea last night half a mile off Melbourne Beach was found by three seaplanes at noon today , but no trace of the aviator was discovered . The Wrecked craft , identified by name and number , was adrift about ten miles down the coast from where it was seen to hit the water . The sea was too rough for the seaplanes to descend to the surface and a small boat sent out from Sebastian , in an attempt to tow the Ford plane , into an inlet , was forced back . City Manager Seitz of . Melbourne and other officials have gone to Fort Pierce , about fifty miles south , where it is hoped a larger boat can be obtained , and further efforts will be made to bring in the plane . The seaplanes have been circling the scene of the accident and the line of drift to the wreckage , but so far have failed to locate Brooks 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated that Brooks climbed out on the wing of his plane just before it went ' down in a nose dive from a height of 100 feet . But this is generally discredited and it is believed that the body will be found in the plane when it is recovered . The plane took off from Titusville , forty miles above here , yesterday about 4 ? . M. It had been tied up there for two days , having been forced to make a landing when a leak in the gasoline tank exhausted the fuel . In making the forced landing at Titusville , after dark , the propeller was broken and a new one was put in before the start was made yester day . It is believed that this is where the trouble lay . The real cause , however , had not been determined this afternoon . The beach was lined with searchers all during Saturday night for twenty miles ' down the , coast . Fear Drift Out to Sea . SEBASTIAN , Fla. , Feb. 26 ( fP ) .  - -  Three seaplanes from Miami sighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about noon today , partly submerged half a mile off shore near here . Major M. K. Lee and Captain Harry Rogers , who were in the seaplanes , said they plainly made out the name , " Ford , " and also the number . Later two fishermen went out in a " sea skiff " and tried to throw a rope over the airplane but the rough sea forced them to put back . The wing tip of the plane had disappeared tonight and grave fears were expressed that the wreck was drifting out to sea . , coast guard patrol boat and a seaplane were standing by where the plane was last sighted and expected to take up the search again at dawn , assisted by a large shrimp tug coming from Fort Pierce . Motorcycle policemen were patroling the beach above and below here tonight , keeping sharp watch for part of the wreckage or the aviator 's body in the event it was washed ashore . Many reports that the body had been found emanated from various sources , but when traced down were found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kept from going to the bottom by its relative lightness combined with whatever buoyancy was supplied by the partly empty gasoline tank . How long it thus could be I kept buoyed was a matter of conjecture , fraught with deep concern to those on shore since the craft was not designed to float . ? A strong ebb tide* was flowing , indicating that the plane might be carried far to sea before a boat of sufficient seaworthiness could reach it . There were no craft . of sufficient depth here to cope the rough water , causing rescuers to turn to Fort Pierce , twenty-eight miles south of here , for the shrimp tug . Its equip- nient of derrick and grapples was thought to be necessary to secure the foundered plane , in view of the fishermen 's failure to attach a line to the wing . The seaplanes reported that the tail only was above water , but the fishermen said that it was the tip of a wing that could be seen . The seas were so muddy that even the fishermen , Theodore Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . C. F. Bowman of the Ford branch at Jacksonville had stated that Brooks was strapped in the plane when he left Titusville for Miami late yesterday and undoubtedly would be found still fastened to it . The fishermen expressed the opinion , however , that the body was not in the cockpit , although they could not be certain . The water where the plane was seen is about fifty feet deep , and the location was about four miles north of here and half a mile off a marshy shore . The muddy water made it impossible to discover whether Brooks 's body was in the cockpit . Brooks Family Bowed in Grief . DETROIT , Feb. 26 VP ) . ?
