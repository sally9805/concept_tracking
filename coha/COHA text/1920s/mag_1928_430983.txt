ANDERS LEONARD ZORN was born in the heart of Dalecarlia. in the town of Mora , Sweden . February 18 , 1860 . His mother . Grudd Anna Andersson , was a peasant girl who had been in Stockholm working in a brewery , and his father , Leonard Zorn , was a Bavarian brewer . The boy grew up under the eyes of his sturdy maternal grandparents . As a little country lad he showed evidence of his artistic bent . He worked on a farm and spent the summers in the mountains tending cattle . While listening to the intoning twang of the cowbells and watching obstreperous goats , his fingers were busy carving passive images of sheep out of wood . With the juices of berries and tinctures of the petals of wild flowers from the meadows he painted his little masterworks . Those fingers would not behave . With chalk they drew startling likenesses of neighbors on the walls of their red-painted farmhouses , and at the age of fifteen some wealthy members of the neighborhood were so convinced of his talent that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the School of Arts and Crafts as a student of sculpture , as well as at the Academy of Arts for painting . Used to the freedom of Dalecarlia he felt op- pressed by the mechanical routine of institutions . But for five years he applied himself to sculpturing , woodcarving and painting under the eagle eyes of the academicians , who resented his growing independence . At twenty he discovered that he could sell his water colors . He sold the portrait of a prominent young widow for forty crowns , and thereupon retired to the basement of the academy to paint others . After that the young wizard seldom appeared for his scheduled classes . He sold water colors and saved the profits . Accordingly , when it finally came to pass that he was expelled from the academy , he was independent , and he started for the Continent . He worked for some months in Spain , and then proceeded to London . There the effort to live within his means proved a failure . So he put on a bold front , rented a studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His courage mastered the situation ; he sold his Spanish pictures and began painting prominent members of the legations . Then Axel Hagg the Swedish artist advised him to try his hand at etching . And , as an etcher , Zorn established himself among the leaders in modern art . He returned to Stockholm in 1885 and married Emma Lamm , the daughter of a wealthy Swedish merchant . For some time they traveled on the shores of the Mediterranean , visiting Turkey and Greece . In 1893 he visited America for the first time , in attendance at the Swedish art exhibition in the World Exposition at Chicago . The vogue for his portrait painting brought him back to America in 1896 , and , thereafter , in five other visits of considerable extent , the last being in 1911 . He came to know Presidents Cleveland and Taft , and Andrew Carnegie , and painted them and other prominent Americans ? such as Mr. and Mrs. Bacon of New York , Mr. Crane and Mr. Deering of Chicago , Dr. Monks of Boston and Mr.  | Ives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being far away from his home in primitive Dalecarlia , he often found recreation in the glamour of Broadway and the burlesque shows ! We have followed Zorn 's roamings over a wide world , while he painted royalty , executed the brilliant etching of Ernest Renan and of his Parisian friends , and gained fame among the cultured . But we have not touched the source that gave balance to his work , the lowly source of his inspiration ? Dalecarlia , the peasants , his home in Mora , the weatherbeaten studio , the mountain hut at Skeriol , around which the cattle still graze . The landscape of Dalecarlia is a mixture of inland seas , hills and dales , embroidered here and there by red timbered mountains . The natives are the most original of Swedish peasants , and still wear their brilliant costume , loftily resenting any change that might make their dress more modern . They are a vigorous race , possessing a calm , justified self-confidence , for from this strong and sound stock one noted personality after another has sprung . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prosperous farms , in their simplicity , their genuine and impulsive friendliness , Zorn learned to find peace and rest and a grateful place in which to work . His surroundings were such as to put him into his best creative moods . Here he could speak the singing old language of his youth , and dwell among his people . While he painted he no doubt dreamed that , when steam and industry had gone thundering all over the world , there , near to Siljan , a little stubborn group of people would speak their own dialect , dance their own dances , and play their music among the hills and dales . Consequently he was a leader of a movement to preserve nationalism , the traditional dances , the motley-colored national costumes , the old peasant music of the fiddle , goat and ox horns . Zorn 's home near Mora church , designed by the artist , is a pleasing reproduction of the most primitive architecture of Dalecarlia . The house is built from lumber cut from his own forest . In the interior some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , while in the billiard-room nothing hides the smooth Dalar beams . Again there are rooms furnished in the red and gold of Louis XIV , others a bizarre mixture of paintings of famous masters , oriental objects of art , rare tapestries and old Dalecarlian relics . This versatility greets our eye also in the garden , where the statue of a smiling child stands poised on the petals of a lotus flower . Many foreign niches lend to the garden a Southern joyfulness . It reminds one of Spain , a country that Zorn liked , and where he learned his first sure strokes as an artist . All these things reveal a man of the world , but the Dalecarlian elements predominate , for the home symbolizes and resembles the master . To this haven he always returned after the visits to the Continent and America , and when he was through with painting portraits of high society and eager to etch and paint for the lowly . Zorn 's home was separated from my home on the island Solleron by a gulf a mile wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred and piqued when my mother objected to my pasting newspaper clippings of Zorn 's nudes on the walls of my room . Afterward I followed the artist 's movements in the press ; and I attended many of his out-of-door musicales.  | Zorn , often appearing in national costume , made a strong impression on me . His figure seemed massive , the walrus mustache and the tired eyelids gave an indifferent expression to his face , relieved only by the keen , penetrating eyes . In those tense eyes there was nothing of the thinker or dreamer ; they met the outer world with a magnetic look that drew to itself all the color and pith that the things that interested him possessed . The passing expression in a face , any movement or action , he caught with lightning accuracy in all its richness . Zorn strongly desired to give to the world a knowledge of the simple , healthful , joyful and untrammeled life of the Dalecarlians . He worked untiringly , and all the while the Dalecarlians and the rest of the world were learning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best when he chose to paint life in motion , as portrayed by his bathing women , his people at work , on a holiday , and especially his-people at play . Zorn 's efforts to give a true picture of objects or elements is portrayed in the light that radiates through the fresh air or on the water waves , in painted figures , shaded so adroitly that one would not be surprised if the shadows suddenly lifted  | and the figures walked off the canvas in the best of order . It is this ability to grasp an emotion and the power to reproduce it that Zorn schooled himself in , that gives the impression that his models stand there in vibrating air , their rich , blond flesh alive with blood and health . Everywhere Zorn looked for the physical force in peasant life that Tolstoy emphasizes ; and the Dalecarlian peasant had it in abundance . Besides his etchings of nudes , many noted works show motifs of Dalecarlia . Zorn 's strong-muscled peasants bake their bread and reap their sheaves with a rare vigor . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zorn was partly a cosmopolitan and partly a primitive Swede , he was always a Dalecarlian at heart . When Zorn turns to display the Dalecarlians in hol iday mood the pictures that he brings forth are almost pathetic . His people are so sober , so overdressed and weighed down by their oldfashioned garments . His paintings of the Dalecarlians at play show us vividly the Nordic dance with its heavy movements . From the first time that one surveys these productions one knows instinctively what they aim to say . The feeling that there is a sharp line of demarcation between play and work in these people 's life predominates . They have no special grace or vivacity , nevertheless they dance with both body and soul . This demonstrates that , in his art , Zorn felt that true reproductions were essential , absolutely necessary ; he realized that inspired pen strokes could add nothing to his  | realism . It was truth he sought . Folk music interested Zorn greatly . For these folk concerts some distant hilltop surrounded by tall pine trees was usually selected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and gripping loneliness . A wagon was drawn up there to serve as a platform for the old masters of the violin and the elderly ladies that played the horns . While the population collected , the exponents of a rapidly dying art sat , as a rule , squatted down , near the wagon , puffing tunes into the bone instruments . Zorn 's musicales under a high Nordic sun were attended by people from every walk of life . The Dalecarlian men dressed in costumes of long black coats , red waists , knee breeches , broad black hats and birchbark shoes . The women wore varicoloured aprons , gay shawls , and ribbons in their hair . On those days Zorn dressed in national costume . With him came artists and friends from the capitals of the Continent . His face expressed his eagerness to make these occasions hours of unforgettable festival joy . The simple horn music has something plaintive , appealing in it that disturbs one emotionally .  | Therefore , the efforts of these peasant women , who labored to produce music with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed audience enwrapt . As a keen promoter of sports Zorn arranged for a yearly horse race , and in January , 1910 , he personally supervised this event for the last time . On those days the men of Dalecarlia saddled their best horses , fastened the shackles to new polished sledges and attended the races as true sportsmen . They were proud of their farm horses , for each beast reflected the care given by the master . Zorn followed every movement of these working horses at play , their large-jointed knees caving deep into the ice of Siljan , racing in a brisk contest . That day in January , 1910 , many watched Zorn as he left the grand stand , mounted a small , well-built horse and rode home . A large wolf-skin coat shielded him from the winter chill and curious eyes , and he was soon lost to sight among the people , headed toward Mora . It was a poetic and impressive passing . It is there , near Mora church , where his maternal ancestors have been buried before him that Zorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skerries outside of Stockholm he contracted an attack of pneumonia that ended his career . Among birches and wooden crosses stands the tombstone , cut out of Dalecarlian rock . Under it the master rests . As time wears on , the simple monument , engraved with the symbol of Saint George 's fight with the dragon , will speak its message of perseverance and good faith to art lovers . Zorn 's work will stand the test of time . It bears out the Tolstoy theory of art . Tolstoy asked , " What is art ? " and then answered , " It is the power to convey the noblest emotion by means of words , music , color or form ; the means of making people feel truth and beauty through their senses . " He then asserts that the proof of great art is that the common people can understand it . As a matter of fact , many of ' the best painters in modern Europe came up from the peasant class . No class appreciated Zorn more than his own native folk of Dalecarlia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own country . While reflecting by Zorn 's grave over the artist 's lifework one senses the motive for Tolstoy 's theory when he asks : " What are the highest and best emotions that artists talk so much about ? Are they not loyalty , love , duty , resignation , patience , courage , everything that means the strength of the race and the goodness of art ? "  |
