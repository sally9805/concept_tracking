Admiral Hughes . chief of naval operations , who had been on duty in the Navy Department since 7 o'clock this morning , working on rescue plans . telephoned the message to Secretary Wilbur as soon as it was received . The Secretary was informed that submarine S-8 was being used in pumping air into the S-4 and that still another submarine , the S-3 , has been ordered from Portsmouth , N. H. , to the scene . Previous to this word a dispatch came from Provincetown stating that divers had heard taps from within the submarine in response to their signals . These sounds came from the torpedo room , which is just forward of the battery room which was shattered by the impact of the collision .

The failure to receive sig1 mils from the two central sections of the boat  --  the control and battery rooms  --  caused no surprise to those familiar with the submarine 's construction , their conjecture being that these compartments were crushed .

Most of the officers in the Bureau of Naval Operations were on duty today . Numerous telephone conversations were held direct between the Navy Department and officers in direct charge of the rescue operations . At 4:42 this afternoon , Rear Admiral Philip Andrews , commanding the First Naval District , wired the Department : " Lieutenant Commander Ellsberg arrives this afternoon at Boston and leaves via destroyer for Provincetown , five divers from Lexington also going at the same time . Third District officers Wickwire and Kelly , two experts on underwater cutting , are ready for service . They are now In reserve . Commander control force said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . " I It was estimated that by tomorrow there would be between thirty and forty divers at the scene of operations . These include eleven from New York , five from the Lexington at Boston , and a large number from ! the torpedo station at New London , ; Conn . The severe cold will make under water operations difficult , it is feared , because of the limited time the divers can remain below the surface of the icy waters . Little fear was held , however , concerning the possibility of pumping sufficient air Into the submarine to keep them alive for several days . One of the first steps the divers are expected to take after learning all of ' the possible places in the submarine where there may be life will be to establish hoe . lines to the air tanks from the outside , which operation , it is believed , will not be difficult . Whether the submarine will be brought up one end at a time , or all at once , must depend upon the possibilities of life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon was that one end might be raised first and the men saved from that ; after which the submarine would be lowered . and the other end brought to the top . This might be done , it was thought , because the S-4 is 236 feet long and lies in 102 feet of water .
