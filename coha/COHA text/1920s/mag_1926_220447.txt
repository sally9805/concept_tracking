Rhodes Riches <P> Since their foundation 23 years ago , the Rhodes scholarships at Oxford for U. S. students have increased-due to wise investment-from 300 to 350 and finally to 400 ( 12,000 ) ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) . The Rhodes trustees have also , lately , been in a position to undertake the erection of a Rhodes House at Oxford , to form an annex to the Bodleian Library and a centre for students of politics in the English-speaking world and for African students . Last week at the annual Rhodes dinner Trustee Sir Otto Beit announced still another Rhodes innovation-a memorial lectureship of 500 per annum to bring to Oxford for a term each year and for not less than two lectures a foreign man or woman " of pre-eminent distinction " in public life or business , in science , scholarship or letters-preferably from the New World . Trustee Sir Otto announced the resignation of Trustee Rudyard Kipling , the appointment of Trustee Stanley Baldwin .                  @ @ @
