Roman travelers in the century after Christ would return to Rome with stories of naked hermits met in far , desert places , whose repeated word was the strange word which eventually worried Rome into believing it : " God is love . . . . " <P> To the new Rome that is the U. S. has returned one of its adopted sons , the ubiquitous , restless Russian painter of Philadelphia , Capt . Vladimir ( " Vovo " ) Perfilieff , erstwhile of the Tsar 's Cossacks ( TIME , Dec. 19 , 1927 ) . Some years he goes to the Balkans . Once he went to Haiti with Naturalist William Beebe . Two years ago he went " up " north down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean . Last summer he went to see the monasteries of Mount Athos in Greece , which have changed scarcely by one syllable of a prayer since the 4th and 5th Centuries . Last week he was telling his friends , and editing a cinema film to show others , about a man of 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose word is : " God is love , and tolerance , and Nature . " <P> The healthy , wooden-faced men in the Mount Athos monasteries were reluctant to tell where the hermit lived . The visitors found him in a high labyrinth of bowlders , a place with a pure blue sky and the sound of bees . " Come in , " answered a frail voice ( in Russian ) when they called . " Here I am . " <P> His eyes were like clear-shining little blue stones , without fear , without self . He cried softly , for joy , and knelt and thanked them for coming to see him . He had seen but 16 other people in his 37 years there . He kept history in tiny scratches on a stone , beside a meticulous lunar calendar . What could he do for them ? - he asked it like a child . Once he had been proud , he said , so he had come here to see God . He had not yet seen God , but now he knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a farmer , a soldier in Russia 's wars , killing many people . He had gone to the monastery to be purified but had found too much comfort ( two meals per day , four hours of sleep , eight hours of prayer or meditation , the rest work ) . So he had climbed the mountain to be alone . <P> At first he tried to subsist for 47 days on sea water , two sips a day , which he stole down the mountain to get . " It contains minerals , " he explained . But his stomach had troubled him so he changed to fresh water , carrying heavy stones for penance on a thong about his neck . Then he had hanged himself by a thong under his armpits , but the thong broke and he fractured his ankle . Then he buried himself to the waist in earth . Faint though he was , God still would not come . That taught him humility . <P> Now he was very happy , waiting only to die . Could they bring him anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried up to him in tins , but accepted an overcoat . He was getting old , he said , and the nights in his cave were sometimes so cold the snakes would creep to him for warmth . He thanked them for the overcoat-which had to be smuggled to him because the monasteries disapprove of him , the solitary-and in return asked them only one favor : they must never tell anyone his real name . Let them call him " Father Ilya " or anything like that . " Because I have put away the world , " he said . " And now I will still know that no one is thinking about me , that I am here all alone .
