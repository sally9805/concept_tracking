txt CONTEMPORARY FRENCH POLITICS Royalists has increased to that extent . It means that the war has provided an extraordinarily interesting theme for the Orleanist journal to write upon . La Vague claims to have a hundred thousand readers . Yet by no means are there a hundred thousand workers in France who desire an immediate revolution . Frenchmen , as much as , if not more than , Americans , read for pleasure . Nevertheless they do not take their newspapers seriously . The extremeness of the press reacts upon its influence . It contributes to its saleability , which , from the standpoint of the newspaper , perhaps is of the chief importance . V In normal times the legal restrictions upon the French press are very limited . Any newspaper may be published without authorization or without the deposit of security . It is only necessary to place a declaration with the proper authority before publication , giving the title of the publication , the name and the residence of the editor , and the name of the establishment printing it . Every journal must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of his civil rights . Every publication must bear the name and the address of the printer . It is not necessary that articles be signed , as they usually are ; but at the time of publication of each issue , two copies signed by the director must be delivered to a court of first instance . Another deposit must be made for Paris with the Ministry of the Interior . As to individual responsibility the director of a paper is obliged to print a reply of any person whom he has named or designated in his paper . Furthermore , if a libelous statement is printed , both the director and // the author of the article can be brought before a correctional court . Journals published in foreign countries and those printed in France in a foreign language are subject to police control.5 The outbreak of the war naturally placed restrictions upon the freedom of the press . On August 5 , 1914 , a law was passed " suppressing the indiscretions of the press in time of war , " which prohibited under the severest penalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly relating to the national defense , except what the Government or the military authorities should communicate to it . The law specified particularly mobilization operations , the transportation of troops and of material , the strength of the army , nomination and changes in the high command , the disposition , location and movement of armies and of the fleet . The law finally broadened the scope of the censorship by including " any information or article concerning military or diplomatic operations of such a nature as to favor the enemy and to exercise a vexatious influence on the spirit of the army and of the population . " The law was to become invalid after the cessation of hostilities at a date to be fixed by a Governmental decree . Although this law was very broad , giving the Government considerable liberty of interpretation , it did not establish a preliminary censorship , but simply provided a penalty for the violation of the law . This penalty was from one to five years ' imprisonment and from two hundred to a thousand dollars ' fine . Although the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enforce the censorship , it was generally recognized that such a task would fall on the judiciary . However , as those familiar with the French censorship know , there existed a preliminary censorship ? and of matter not included in the law of August 5 , and it was the military , not the judicial authorities , which interpreted and enforced it . Because of this , it was natural that many newspapers should attack the censorship administration as illegal ; but as a matter of fact , the censorship did not rest upon the law of August 5 , but upon the declaration of the State of Siege , made August 2 , and later confirmed by a law of August 5.10 The effects of the State of Siege are laid down by a law passed on August 9 , 1849 , the chief result of which is to substitute the military for the civil authority . " Normal guarantees of individuals are suppressed by it ; military tribunals are given cognizance of crimes against the safety of the Republic , against the Constitution , against order and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of perquisition and the right to prohibit publications and meetings which it judges of a nature to excite disorder . By this latter authority the French Government maintained , from the declaration of the State of Siege to October 13 , 1919 , a censorship limited in power solely to its own judgment . The establishment of the censorship was announced to the newspapers in a note , August 4 , which said : " The Government counts on the good and patriotic will of the i // press of all parties , at Paris and in the provinces , not to publish any information concerning the war , whatever may be its source , its origin or nature , without having it viseed by the press bureau established at the Ministry of War . " The composition of this bureau varied , but it was always of an exclusively military character in membership and in policy . In the provinces , it was usually directed by commissions created by the Prefects , subject to control by the press bureau of the War Ministry at Paris . As penalties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the censor refused to vise , it was warned for the first offense ; for the second , it might be suspended for a period arbitrarily set . Suspension from publication , which was ordered by a decision of the " President of the Council of Ministers " was accompanied by the seizure of all the copies of the journal suspended . In three respects , then , the French censorship exceeded that established by Parliament in 1914 . It was administered by military authorities , it was preventative ( preliminary to the publication of an article ) and universal , and it extended to matters not included in the law of August 5 . The censorship , thus constituted , knew no bounds ; it censored subject matter for which there appeared to be no justification , news which was given complete publicity in other countries . Furthermore , it repeatedly discriminated in its applications ; news and opinions of an identical nature were denied to some papers , while their publication was allowed to others . L'Europe Nouvelle , an outspoken , liberal weekly , felt the censor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign news would appear blank except for // a line explaining that " 230 lines had been censored . " On November 9 , the censor prevented it from saying that certain clauses in the Austrian armistice caused considerable emotion among the Croats and Slays , when the entire English and Italian press was full of controversies over it . It was even prohibited from speaking of the movement in Spain for a revision of the Constitution . Likewise , it could not comment upon the November electoral campaign in the United States when L'Echo de Paris was allowed to publish unfair dispatches from its New York correspondent about it . It was forbidden to cite certain articles in the program of the Revolutionary Socialists in Switzerland , when that program had appeared in extenso in Le Temps , the day before . It was forbidden in its Polish dispatches of November 16 to show how the coup d'etat of the nationalists in Poland harmed the democratic movement , when L'Humanite was authorized to publish violent attacks against its chief nationalist leader , Dmowsky . It could not print the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in full in the New Europe in London . Finally , it was not allowed to point out to its readers that the products of the Saar valley were of an inferior quality when industrial groups , such as the Committee of Forges , were publicly expressing such opinions . French papers were not allowed to print dispatches containing news of the rice riots in Japan , or even of the United States Senate Aircraft Report when the entire Allied press was giving both events the fullest publicity . The military authorities gave no reasons for the censorship of such articles or for allowing some papers to print reports denied to others . Charges were even insinuated that papers , which were refused the // right to publish an article , would turn around and sell it to another where the censorship had no objection to its publication . Whether it was graft or customary military stupidity that caused this situation , it justly aroused a tremendous opposition . La Vieille-France was a frequent , though a deserved victim of the censor 's knife . Consequently it was violent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson could say that European cabinets were without valor , prudence or foresight , but Urbain Gohier could not say what he thought about the American President . Although the whole world accused France of imperialism and although everybody defended Germany , patriots like Gohier " can not reply a word to them . We can not risk ruffling a German ( censored ) ! " A newspaper was started recently in Paris , called La Republique Busse , whose purpose was to combat Bolshevism and Czarism at the same time . The censor naturally allowed its articles against Bolshevism to pass , but it refused to allow the publication of an editorial which denounced " the open or disguised attempts of monarchist restoration . " The League of the Rights of Man vigorously denounced such an abuse of the censor in the service of any party , especially a party of reaction . As has been seen , the censorship did not cease with hostilities . Some of its greatest flagrancies occurred during the armistice . The case of L'Information , an independent paper , edited by Leon Chavenon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liberal papers in Paris , attracted a great deal of attention . On March 2 , 1919 , it published an article upon the " Essential Clauses of the Peace Preliminaries . " The article 295 fr CONTEMPORARY FRENCH POLITICS apparently was not viseed by the censor for upon its publication the editor and the writer of the article , Charles Omessa , were charged with violation of the law of August 5 , 1914 , and L'In f ormation , was suspended for eight days . M. Chavenon asserted that the censor had only informed him of its decision at a very late hour on Saturday , at a time when the printing had already commenced . When the censor finally did send his disapproval the article was immediately removed . The few copies already distributed it was impossible to recall . Furthermore , the very same information had appeared in another paper the day before . Other similar instances were frequent . On the 8th of May , Le Temps published , apparently with the permission of the censor , a long and detailed summary of the restitutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It published this information in the face of a statement that no evening paper would receive this news upon that day . But Le Bonsoir , the evening edition of the L'GJuvre , edited by Gustave Tery , had also arranged for the publication of an identical article ; but the censor formally forbade its printing , threatening seizure in case of disobedience . Aroused by this discrimination , M. Tery took the matter to the courts , and entered a " double complaint in forfeiture , " one of the most serious charges in French law , with the Military Governor of Paris against the chief censor , Major Nusillard , and against M. Mandel , M. Clemenceau 's Chef de Cabinet . Mandel has often been referred to in the Chamber of Deputies as Clemenceau 's " Grey Eminence , " many claiming that while M. Clemenceau was busy with the Peace Conference , Mandel was the real Prime Minister . After the filing of // this complaint Major Nusillard was reported to have resigned , but to have subsequently withdrawn his resignation . Tery made it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outcome of the case , it increased the demand for the censorship 's removal . During the last week of April , 1919 , the censor was especially stern . Marshal Foch had given out another of his interviews to the London papers urging the annexation of the left bank of the Rhine . As a result of trying to reproduce the article from the British papers , Le Bansoir , La Patrie and La Democratic Nouvelle all went down under the censor 's swoop . To obtain this interesting news , Parisian readers had to wait for the London mail ! In fact , Le Boizsair was seized three times during this week . On May 15 , the Paris edition of the New York Herald attempted to print the measures which the Allies were going to take in the event that the Treaty was not signed by Germany . The information merely told of Foch being ordered to the Rhine to make all preparations for immediate military operations . In the very same number of the Chicago Tribune , exactly the same information was given in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision in the one case when he came to the other ; or he had decided to change his mind , the possession of which many papers were beginning to doubt . For the Herald article was suppressed and the Tribune 's was passed . The fact that the censorship exceeded considerably the provisions of the law which the Parliament passed on August 5 , 1914 , joined with its onerous policy , led to early attempts to put it upon a legislative basis . In // March , 1915 , M. Paul Meunier 12 introduced a bill into the Chamber declaring the State of Siege lifted in Paris and in all the non-invaded departments . As it finally failed of passage , M. Meunier in October , 1915 , introduced a bill which the Commission on Civil Legislation adopted whose object was to provide for a legal , preliminary censorship in time of war , placing it under the control of the civil authority ? the prefect of police in Paris , and the prefects in the departments , and to limit strictly its application to articles of a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injure the national defense . Articles upon interior politics would be excluded from the censorial scissors . The bill did not come up for discussion until January , 1916 . The debate upon it occupied all the sessions from the 21st to the 25th . Finally , M. Briand , the Premier , admitted that some errors had been made by the censor , but he insisted that the national defense exacted its maintenance ; consequently the proposition was returned to the Commission . After the armistice , the Socialist and Radical parties , the C. G. T. , and many newspaper organizations demanded that the State of Siege be raised and that the censorship be removed . Because of the peace negotiations , the Government did not believe it wise to allow freedom of discussion . But after the German signature of the Treaty , the editor of Le Matin ( June 25 , 1919 ) wrote to the President of the Press Syndicate , asking it to demand the raising of the censorship , now that the conference was virtually closed , in order that the French public be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspired by this letter , M. Jean Dupuy , Presi- // dent of the Syndicate , addressed a letter to M. Clemenceau , upon July 2 , asking that the censorship be removed . On July 8 , another bill sponsored by M. Paul Meunier , demanding the abolition of the State of Siege and the censorship , came up in the Chamber for discussion . M. Stephen Pichon , Minister of Foreign Affaires , declared that the same reasons demanded the continuance of the State of Siege and the censorship until the French ratification of the Treaty as existed during the peace negotiations . As a result of his speech and his assurance that the censorship would be repealed immediately upon ratification and before the time of the elections , the Meunier proposition was defeated by a vote of 256 to 202 . It was only upon the 12th of October , 1919 , a few days after the Chamber ratified the Treaty , that presidential decrees were issued raising the State of Siege and abolishing the censorship . Thus it appears that the French censorship was of longer duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Allied countries . Yet it should not be judged too harshly . During the war , France , unlike most of her Allies , was the field of operations , where the greatest precautions had to be taken . During the Peace Conference , she was the host of the world ; the bitterness apparent everywhere at times , it was a considerable task to suppress . The discriminations , of course , can not be justified . They appear to be faults inherent in the French bureaucracy and magnified by the military part of it . In comparison with the American censorship , the French censorship may seem unduly severe and dictatorial . But as a matter of fact the expression of opinion is much more free in France than it is in America to-day . No efforts were made to suppress the mutterings of the minoritaire Socialists dur- // ing the war . In America every one of them would have been jailed for violating the sedition acts . Has the French Chamber ever expelled its Socialist members as the New York Assembly has just done ? Jamais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " utterances , to which the Chamber replied with laughter , ? after all , the most effective answer . Frenchmen realized what American legislators apparently can not realize , that to make martyrs of men is merely to increase their following . Consequently , the French policy was to await the commission of overt acts before taking measures to deny Socialist elements a right to be heard . In so doing , France has probably avoided the very end which New York legislators and American Congressmen , if they persist in their suppressive actions , will invite , namely , a revolution by force . If the French Chamber had expelled its hundred Socialist members during the war , it would have had a revolution on its hands in ten minutes . Why ? Because so long as these gentlemen were openlungedly venting their opinions at the tribune of the Chamber , there was nothing to revolt about . They were not being suppressed ; they could work in the open and they could be repelled in the open . The Government believed that the people of France had sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines of Socialism , without the self-asserted guardianship of legislatures and Government officials who , by force , might attempt to conceal from them doctrines which , on account of their very nature , can not be concealed . It was far better to have the arguments for proletariat dictatorship debated in the forums of public assemblies , where they could be analyzed and where their errors could be readily pointed out , than to have // those arguments bottled up in a caldron of discontent , whose seething waters were sooner or later bound to scald those who fed the fires which kept them hot . The tolerance of the " seditious " elements in France during the war ? repulsive as the tactics of those elements were ? was essential to the winning of the war . If they had been " stamped out " by the " iron force of the law , " France would have been so weakened internally that she would have had to sue for a humiliating peace . It may be an irritation to the amour propre of America to say it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts at self-government we have too often ridiculed , can teach us some badly needed lessons in the basic principles of democracy . CHAPTER X The French bureaucracy is noted for its magnitude , its centralization and as a Paris editor has said , " its honest sloth . " Not only does it completely monopolize the management of many services left to private enterprise in other countries , but it exercises this management inefficiently from the standpoint of public accommodation , and unprofitably from the budgetary point of view . Its condition has led to the most insistent demand for administrative reform . This demand , which calls for both the decentralization of public services and the surrender of present industrial prerogatives of the Government to individuals , is more urgently advanced than the demand for purely political regeneration . Upon the general weaknesses of this administrative system Professor Villey has written : The central authority , charged with deciding every affair of the country , is overwhelmed by an inextricable task . The heads of the ministerial departments themselves can not have a personal knowledge of even the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresponsible bureau-302 ! BUREAUCRACY AND STATE SOCIALISM cracy . The questions which arise in one district , in a determined center , often at the extreme ends of the country , are treated without competence , often even settled without discussion . More frequently it is the deputies of the place who decide , and usually they are men of parties . Politics is mixed up with every question , and favoritism is given a free course . The multiple formalities which centralization brings with it , lead to interminable delays , very prejudicial to the public interest ' A complete description of the French bureaucracy can not be given , but a few instances of its method of functioning may be cited . The French railway system perhaps offers one of the best instances of the inefficiency of public industry . The State line , and the Western line , having a mileage of about 5,600 miles , are owned and operated by the French Government ; while the greater lines in France , such as the Paris and Orleans , the Paris , Lyons and Mediterranean , the Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated under Government leases . According to the figures of the Ministry of Public Works , the State line in 1913 was the least profitable of the roads in France , in spite of the fact that it runs through one of the most richly developed parts of the country . Its gross earnings were $10,560 per mile compared with $26,800 per mile earned by the Northern road . The net earnings would doubtless have made the comparison worse . As for service , the State line is notoriously inferior to the private roads . At the time of the purchase of the Western line by the Government in 1908 it had a deficit of $5,260,000 . In the operations of 1913 , the Government reached a deficit CONTEMPORARY FRENCH POLITICS upon this line of $15,280,000 , an increase in one year of $10,000,000 , and during the five years of Government operation the total deficit reached was nearly $47,000,000 . In technical terms , the coefficient of exploitation ( ratio of operating expense to income ) of the State road , Government operated , in 1918 was 120 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 87 per cent ; of the Orleans , which was 85 per cent , and of the P. L. &; M. road , which was 90 per cent . The coefficient for the State road even exceeded that of the private companies operating in the devastated regions ? 96 per cent for the Eastern and 112 per cent for the Northern.2 During the war all of the private roads were requisitioned and placed under a military regime by authority of the law of 1889 ; at first they were under the direction of the Ministry of War , and later , of the Ministry of Public Works . The great majority of the military commissioners who took over the operation of these railways knew little of their organization and functioning . Although the roads eventually responded to the military needs of the country , it was at nearly a doubled operating expense . Perhaps this was to be expected under war conditions ; but in addition , the economic needs of the nation were sacrificed by what appeared to be unintelligent management . After the close of hostilities , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes of the height of , prices ; cars could not be obtained to meet the demands of the // devastated regions . Meanwhile , there were hundreds of cars lying idle in the American military yards , such as at Gievres , which the French Government refused to take over . Government control and operation of railways may have other justifications than mere economy ; but the State-owned and the State-controlled roads in France conclusively show that so far as efficiency is concerned , private roads are unquestionably superior . Not only is the post-office in France operated by the Government , but under the same service come the telegraphs and telephones . France has some 13,000 postoffices , 16,000 public telegraphs , and 219,000 telephones , all controlled from Paris . Such a control is so centralized that even the setting up of a letter-box , the creation of a substation , or the extension of a telegraph line must have the consent of the Central Ministry . This absoluteness of direction doubtless prevents the extension of these facilities . According to a statement of Lazare Weiller in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two thirds of the 36,536 communes in France do not have post-offices ; half of them do not have telephone service , and a great number of them have no official communication with the outside world except through a daily rural postman . Telegraph offices , situated in the mountains , have their lines blockaded during the winter and their wires cut ; and the Government service is satisfied to leave them for months in a useless condition . On the 29th of March , 1919 , the Paris papers published the details of a " Telegraph Scandal " which an investigating committee of the Chamber of Deputies had unearthed . It charged the Telegraphic Control Section , of which M. Tannery was the head , with scandalous abuses . M. Tannery , during the investigation , // admitted that 40,000 dispatches had been held back by his section daily . The majority of them were never delivered , being thrown into the basket , and upon accumulation , destroyed . The senders and those to whom they were addressed were never informed . On the occasion of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suppressed large stock exchange orders and dispatches of funds for the loan . During the war , it even destroyed telegrams from munition factories at Le Creusot and Firminy with the result that some of them had to close down for want of supplies . Telegrams from or to foreign sovereigns received no privileged treatment , and even the correspondence of the French Foreign Office became lost in the maze of treasonable stupidity or intrigue of this Section . At first unknown to the French Foreign Office , diplomatic telegrams sent by the French Ambassadors in Rome and London to Spain , were pigeonholed , as were telegrams to the Paris office from M. Bapst , the French Minister at Copenhagen . The Ministry of Foreign Affairs , in a complaint , said that , " under its present head , the Telegraphic Control Section is an organ of confusion and of disorder which has engendered extraordinary abuses and risked compromising the Government seriously and hampering its general policy . " As a result of these revelations , M. Tannery was relieved as head of the Section . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition , he was appointed to the exchange commission sent by the Minister of Finances to Alsace and Lorraine ! It was only after the Chamber had given publicity to its investigation that he was finally dismissed from this post . The French Government operates monopolies in // matches , gun powder , and tobacco . During the war it increased the prices of some of these articles in the hope of additional revenue ; but it disguised its real purpose by informing the public that the supply was nearing exhaustion . Although the provinces went smokeless , the Government saw to it that members of Parliament were amply supplied . As a reason for the tobacco shortage , the Government also contended that consumption during the war had greatly increased . Yet in a report made to the Chamber upon the 27th of February , 1918,3 by M. Grodet , figures were quoted , showing that consumption had diminished 3 per cent and 4 per cent during 1915 and 1916 , in comparison with 1914 ; and that consumption in 1917 was exactly the same as that of 1914 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying customs duties on them , and selling them in the French Pyrenees for fifteen and thirty centimes a package , while the French Government was selling identical cigarettes for eighty centimes and a franc . Although this tobacco incident is comparatively insignificant , it illustrates the extravagant , if not extortionate , character of a Government monopoly . One of the noticeable failures of Government operation during the war was the Arsenal at Roanne . This was a project of Albert Thomas , a former Minister of Armament , who decided to erect this arsenal in October , 1915 . The buildings covered an area of about seventy-five acres and the plant employed workmen , varying in number from 11,500 to 40,000 . By December 31 , 1918 , the expenditures upon the plant had surpassed $56,000,000 , while the total value of // the shells produced up to this time scarcely came to $4,000,000 . ' The Roanne Chamber of Commerce , in a report made on the 7th of December , 1918 , protested against the manner in which this establishment was being operated . It accused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of employing irresponsible and incompetent employees , of exercising no intelligent control , and of inexcusably squandering public funds . As an example of the deception under which the arsenal was operated , the Chamber cited an instance when M. Thomas , wishing to determine the arsenal 's capacity , examined certain machinery for turning shells . With this as a criterion of the arsenal 's productive power , he pronounced himself completely satisfied . But as a matter of fact , according to the Chamber , the machinery had been purposely erected that morning , and upon the Minister 's departure , again dismantled . In regard to salaries , a carpenter , paid three dollars a day in a private concern , made a hundred and twenty dollars in four weeks at the arsenal . A laborer , paid fifteen cents an hour in a steel plant at Roanne , was able by piece work to make five dollars in three hours at the arsenal . In regard to comparative costs of production , 155 mm. shells at the arsenal cost more than a hundred dollars ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for exactly the same product . The control and development of ports is another affair directed by the Central Government . The port of Havre was recognized forty years ago as being insufficient for the needs of French commerce . Five years of agitation were necessary to secure the voting of a // project providing for its development by the Chamber , which was finally achieved in 1882 . Nine years were then necessary for the Senate to examine the bill . Finally in 1891 it rejected it to the extent of refusing the greater part of its provisions . So the agitation had to start over again and a still more modest project was placed on foot . Four more years were this time necessary for Parliament to adopt the latter project , which was done in 1895 . Thus nineteen years were taken to reach a decision upon a necessary public work which it required seven years more to carry out . Twenty-six years elapsed between the conception and the achievement of this project . In the meantime business interests languished . Apparently the administration is not moved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgets and makes patchwork additions to calm them ; but in the years of delay , the productive capacities of France are unutilized . As a result , France has few harbors , a feeble merchant marine and an inadequate system of transportation ; costs of production are high and other countries easily outdistance her in commercial fields . In addition to the incident of the port of Havre , the development of the port of Marseille necessitated a list of formalities which filled two columns in the Journal Officiel , a publication of about the same size as , and corresponding to our Congressional Record . The port administration is itself dependent upon six different ministries . The Saigon bamboo case is another celebrated instance of the workings of the French bureaucracy . The French arsenal at Saigon in the Orient was in need of bamboo , a need which was communicated to Paris . It happened that Saigon was the center of one of the most // prolific bamboo districts in the world . The technical services in Paris knew this ; but because of an ancient ruling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered that bamboo be secured and shipped from Toulon to the Orient . Six months of time were lost in the transaction as well as several hundred dollars . But that was immaterial to the bureaucracy . It had acted according to regulations and its own " responsibility " was clear . Instances of Government inefficiency in the national printing establishment , where expenditures exceeded by twenty-three times the original estimates ; in the fountains of Versailles , which take an immense amount of water ; in the Gobelin manufactures ; in the mint ; in the management of the Journal Officiel ; in the scandal of the Rodin forgeries ; and in the reconstruction of the devastated regions , do not need citing to establish a fact which Frenchmen have almost come to tolerate as an inevitable necessity . According to L ' ( Euvre , a vigorous opponent of the bureaucracy , the American army officials were constantly interfered with in the erection of a stadium at Joinville which the United States was to give to France . Arrangements were made with the National Committee of Physical Education as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1 , 1919 . But subordinate Government officials deliberately delayed construction by petty persecution of contractors and even by summonses against American drivers . L'cEuvre wondered whether French bureaucrats were deaf , blind , or criminal . The French Diplomatic Service , from the standpoint of training , is supposed to be the most skilled in the world . But according to a report to the Chamber by // Louis Marin , ' in 1912 over a hundred diplomatic agents were removed from their posts and transferred to others either before they were , or when they were just upon the point of being , acquainted with the conditions of their posts . Out of thirty-two legations , only eleven were directed by the same head between 1912 and 1914 . . Even during the war , thirty-seven diplomatic agents were displaced and transferred to other offices . The constant replacing of agents , rendering them incapable of acquiring full knowledge of their posts and authority sufficient to regulate affairs to the satisfaction of both countries , could not but be prejudicial to France . French administrative methods in Alsace-Lorraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces . Contradictory orders , complete destruction of German organization and the substitution for it of French disorder , have received not only the criticism of such conservative papers as the L'Echo de Parris , ' but of the Socialist papers such as L'Ileurre.7 In addition to these governmental activities , the French administrative system practically controls every phase of local government , the educational system of the country , and a large army and navy . The number of Government employees engaged in these enterprises is as follows : // Furthermore , the number of civil employees increases each year ; in 1906 they numbered 702,596 ; in 1907 , 727,792 ; 1908 , 740,290 , and 1909 , 778,565 . This great number of citizens it is generally estimated that one out of every eleven voters is a Government official ? in the employ of the Government creates a vast political problem . The evils arising from such a condition are plainly apparent . The French bureaucracy not only reaches into fields ordinarily left to private enterprise , it not only commits the most costly blunders in its activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it habitually interferes with the exercise of private initiative in the realm theoretically left to it . Even to fence a field along a public road or to change the sign-plate upon a street car in a small town , the approval of the central authorities is necessary . Authorization is required also to build a shack upon waste land for which a tax of seven cents must be paid , and which requires going through twenty-four formalities . I.f one wishes to place a rowboat upon a river , sixteen different negotiations with the central authorities must be gone through . To fence a field , nineteen negotiations are required . It takes two years of bargaining to get the consent of the Government to build even a shed upon a wharf. ? These complications , and this endless red tape could be done away with if local authorities were empowered to handle these affairs . There seems to be no reason why consent of any nature should be required for such purely personal and insignificant activities . Speaking of the interminable delays of French functionaries , a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or vituperate against the Government , either in conference or through newspapers . .. but they are vigorously forbidden to do anything themselves and to carry out the work which their own districts need , and their advice has no effect on functionaries , in the matter of industrial development . There is no liberty for citizens to act ; it is impossible for them to make a move without being entangled in the network of authorization , of paper-work , and of formalities , ending in an omnipotent , incompetent , inert and incoherent State , which has reserved to itself the initiative in every question interesting national or regional life , while it is capable of solving nothing by its very constitution . Forty years of this treatment have killed initiative and originality in our provinces . Tied down , held in leash , our population leads a languishing life and its faculties little by little are atrophied 10 According to this writer , the excessive number of Government officials is due to the fact that Statism almost completely prevents the exercise of independent occupations whose development is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up and accept a starvation but certain wage in Government employment . " Because of these precarious conditions every Frenchman is more or less a candidate for public employment , toward which he is attracted by the law of least resistance , because under our centralized administration , the poorly remunerated functionary leads a miserable life , but exempt from anxiety ; far from his employer , the State , who does not know him and for whom he is only a register , he works automatically , without taking any responsibility ; he is even forbidden to take any initiative and his advancement is made by seniority , whatever may be his merit and his application . . . . " // II In every belligerent country the war necessitated an increased State control over private activities . Particularly was this so in France , where the Government not only assumed supervision of , but the direct participation in , industrial processes . Food control naturally became imperative ; and by a law of October 16 , 1915 , the Ministry of Food Supply was organized and entrusted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit of 120,000,000 francs was placed at its disposal and the Ministry was instructed to make an annual statement of profit and loss . In the first year of operation , it had a deficit of 142,156,000 francs , to which should be added customs duties and registry fees . Later , this deficit rose to 400,000,000 francs , to which should be added 225,000,000 francs in customs duties , etc . The policy of maximum prices , which has generally proved futile , was adopted early in the war ; at first , it was applied to wheat , oats , rye , barley , bran , grain offals ; later , it was extended to sugar , coffee , potatoes , milk , margarine , aliment fats , edible oils , dried legumes , paraffin and petrol , commercial fertilizer , copper , sulphate , and sulphur . In 1917 , coal , bread and sugar cards were instituted which allowed each family a limited ration of each of these commodities . This rationing was not entirely done away with until the summer of 1919 . Its ineffectiveness may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces underwent in April and May , 1919 . Sugar was unobtainable and the sugar cards were useless ; although they entitled the holder to purchase 750 grams of sugar a month , no sugar could be found to // buy . But in the midst of this famine , the Government in an " official explanation " asserted that it had amply supplied the city of Paris with sugar for a period of two months , but that certain grocers were deliberately hoarding it for speculation purposes . This the latter hotly denied , at the same time pointing out that the Government was allowing confectioners an unlimited amount for candies and pastries . Finally , B. Vilgrain , Undersecretary of State for Food Supply , offered another " solution " of the problem by securing a thousand tons of American granulated sugar , which he placed in the shops and in his own creation , the Vilgrain booths , which were really Government stores , supplied by Government-purchased supplies , transported by Government carriers . Even this did not appear to relieve the situation , especially not in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so noticeably due to Government inconsistency that the municipal council of Lyons , in its session of June 16 , 1919 , passed a resolution , asking the Government why it was that industries of pure luxury , such as pastry-makers and brewers , were given sugar when it was refused for family consumption . One of the food-control measures , also prompted by the necessity for economy in ocean tonnage , was the Government requisition of the Merchant Marine . Under authority of a law passed February 10 , 1918 , a Government decree , issued five days later , requisitioned the entire merchant fleet . According to the commission charged by the Chamber to examine the Government operation of this fleets it was found that under it importations dropped off 839,698 tons or 5 per cent ; this figure would have amounted to 2,500,000 tons or 15 per cent if it had not been for the increased assistance from // the English and American fleets . Examples of boats with half-filled cargoes , docks loaded down with goods awaiting shipment for weeks , ships sent to ports too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chamber recited an instance of the Government landing 22,500 quintaux 11 of wheat atHavre ( May 23 , 1918 ) , and shipping them by rail up to Rouen . This involved another handling of the cargo and the utilization of railway transportation sorely needed elsewhere , when the cargo could just as easily have been taken by ship to Rouen . In an article on the obstruction of the Port of Marseille , in Le Petit Parisien , " it was pointed out that under private operation of shipping a merchant asked three days to unload a ship of 3,000 tons at Marseille ; but now under State control the same task , in some cases , had taken from the 14th of November to the middle of February . Instances are known of cargoes of eggs making the voyage three times from Philippeville to Marseille , before being finally unloaded ; while at the time of writing the article , 100,000 tons of perishable material were slowly deteriorating at the port because of lack of attention.13 III One of the most important features of the control of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Consortiums " established // by the Government to monopolize and distribute importations completely . Unrestricted importations were prohibited by a law passed May 6 , 1916 , " which at the same time raised tariff rates and gave the Government complete control of the contingencies of foreign materials to be brought to France . This action was part of the inter-Allied plan of apportionment of resources . It arose from the difficulty of foreign payments , from the necessity of giving the military needs of the country priority , and of utilizing to the best advantage the merchant marine . Finally , the most powerful and diligent manufacturers could not be allowed to import freely under disrupted war conditions , because they would have exhausted the market for weaker or later competitors . The Government believed it would be better to divide or ration supplies methodically , giving to each according to his production capacity . With this principle established , the State itself became judge of tonnage availabilities and purchaser and negotiator for foreign importations and payments . Despite the necessity of evading industrial anarchy , the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the British Government ; but it chose the most extreme alternative of State Socialism , and precipitated perhaps as great a danger as the one it avoided . By virtue of the law of May , 1916 , a Government decree of March 22 , 1917 , created a Committee of Derogations and Prohibitions , charged with determining quarterly contingents of importations for determined products and forming a plan for the apportionment of these contingents . " By a strange parliamentary procedure , a law passed January 20 , 1919 , ratified this decree . The // first State institutions arising from these decrees were inter-ministerial committees , organized for each industry . Their method of operation was illustrated by the Inter-ministerial Committee on Wool . This committee , as disclosed in the Chamber 's interpellation of the Government upon June 28 , 1915,16 was charged with the enactment of measures destined to assure the supply of wool under the best possible conditions to the different branches of the French textile industry , so as to satisfy the general needs of the country for goods manufactured in wool ( being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority over all others ) . Specifically this committee was ( 1 ) to centralize needs of all kinds ; ( 2 ) to establish ( the needs of the army first being attended to ) the order of priority for the other national needs ; ( 3 ) to determine , by limitation , if necessary , the nature of products to be manufactured from raw materials , and the labor and the materials to be used ; ( 4 ) to fix , in agreement with unions or industrial groups constituted under authority of the Ministry of Commerce , the maximum prices of transformation for important parts in manufacture , such as combing , spinning , dyeing , etc. ; to fix the maximum selling prices of products obtained from these transformations and delivered , either to industry or to consumers ; ( 5 ) to determine quantities and classes of the different materials for manufactured products to be imported for all purposes ; ( 6 ) to study the order of urgency for the introduction of diverse products , under the reservation that the materials necessary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give advice on the kinds of consortiums or groups which it will be necessary to form // between agents or manufacturers , to regularize industrial production and to facilitate relations between producers and consumers , under the control of the Minister of Commerce ; ( 8 ) to make any proposition to regulate the sale of materials of products of wool eventually , and , if necessary , to restrain consumption ; ( 9 ) to give advice on questions of exportation concerning wool or objects manufactured from it ; ( 10 ) finally , to examine all other questions relating to this textile and which they judge useful to submit to the different ministries interested . As will be seen from these powers , such a committee , composed only of Cabinet Ministers with no technical members upon it , was empowered to control completely the amount of raw materials given to private industry , the amount and price of output , and the wages of labor engaged upon it . This was perhaps the most extensive task a modern State has undertaken.17 Subjected to the control of these inter-ministerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of grouping together manufacturers who deal in a certain raw material . With a few exceptions , it was only by belonging to such a group that manufacturers could obtain raw materials . " The consortium . . . is a species of joint-stock company , a kind of cooperative association which has as its shareholders the members of a determined industry and which enters into a contract with the State with a view to obtaining from it , upon certain conditions , the materials needed by this industry to function . " " The contract between the State and the consortium // specified that the manufacturers lost the right of buying , individually or collectively , the raw materials necessary to their business . The State alone could make these purchases , that is , if they must be imported . The consortium therefore received its raw materials from the hands of the State , and these it was obliged to receive in whatever amounts the State should wish to dole out , and to reimburse the State for all expenditures made by it in securing the material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then divided among the members of the consortium according to determined rules of apportionment and at a price which the State fixed in a manner to assure a certain profit to the consortium , to remunerate the capital invested in it . Finally , the State also fixed the price at which the products obtained by the manufacturers by means of this raw material , should be sold to the consumer . An example of the composition and the operation of such an organism , was that of the French Oil Companies . This consortium was constituted in the form of a joint-stock company with an initial capital of 5,000 , - 000 francs , divided into 10,000 shares of 500 francs each . These shares were purchased and held by all the manufacturers of oil arising from foreign grains , such as cottonseed , flaxseed , and castor oil plants , in determined proportions , according to the extent of the business of each . Each member 's share of the seeds imported by the Government was irrevocably fixed by the respective stock subscriptions . Upon notice of the consortium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the consortium , and was reimbursed for the purchase . The consortium , in turn , sold the material to its , memhers according to the amount of stock each held in the consortium , with the understanding that the State // would fix the selling price of the seed delivered by the consortium to its members and also the price at which the products manufactured from the seed should be sold . By this means , a business which before the war aggregated a figure of more than a billion francs , found itself subjected to the rigid control of the French bureaucracy . This system of consortiums it was only logical to extend to as many raw materials as possible ; and the Ministries of Commerce , of Blockade , of National Reconstruction , and of Armament organized consortium after consortium , extending even to such articles as glassware , jute , leather and hides , oils , pit-coal , petroleum , lead and cotton . The grave feature of this policy was that it held private industry in the absolute grip of the State , it substituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of those interested ? the bureaucratic buyer , for the industrial buyer . The French Government did not wish a simple understanding between manufacturers and the State ( as the British Government had with the British Association of Oil Brokers ) , limiting their activities to the national welfare but at the same time allowing the exercise of intelligence and energetic business ability . But on the contrary , the French administration took everything into its own hands . Although nominally receiving advice from the consortiums as to business needs , it made the purchases itself and enforced them upon industry . Whether or not the Government admitted it , the result of this policy was the total monopoly of control over those French industries which utilized imported raw materials . The State completely held the raw material . It therefore became the absolute master of in- // dustries dependent on it . A merchant not a member of a consortium , either because of his own unwillingness to come under the dictatorship of the State or because of his inability to buy the stock when it is offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if his business is dependent upon it , he is obliged to close down . " Outside of the consortium , " M. Emmanuel Brousse said in the Chamber upon the 28th of June , 1918 , " there are neither raw materials , labor , orders nor the possibility of transportation . " At the same time , M. Rene Germond , one of the important members of the Syndicate of Iron Merchants , illustrated a similar result in these words : The consortium regime absolutely prevents retail merchants from procuring merchandise , because they can not belong to a consortium . Formalities must be gone through which are impossible for them ; they do not possess the office help necessary for all the paper-work needed to make out the orders . The merchant is therefore obliged to purchase his goods from an important member of the consortium . But the latter prefers to sell them to his large clients . . . . No longer being supplied , the retailer finds himself prevented from carrying on his role , so indispensable , of supplying a small patronage.19 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of purchase , was one of the results of the consortium system ; the result was the more serious because this trade paid more taxes than the wholesalers did , and it was the foundation of French industry . In sum , the French consortium system did its best to monopolize and to control in every particular the major portion of French industry . It almost meant the total // suppression of freedom of industry and of industrial competition . It was probably a larger attempt at an all-inclusive State Socialism than even the demagogic advocates of the theory had contemplated . That a group of inexperienced Government officials , unstimulated by business interests , should attempt intelligently to determine the vast needs of national industry , upon which the minds of thousands of the most intelligent men have been occupied , was an absurdity , a few of the results of which may now be pointed out . This inability of the State to determine industrial needs was partly recognized in the summer of 1918 by M. Clementel , the Minister of Commerce . He consented to allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for some unknown reason , he reserved the preliminary sanction of these purchases . This approval took so much time that when his signature ' finally was obtained , usually ten or twelve days after its request , the market had changed , prices had mounted , and the consortium had to pay tens of millions more for the product because of the intervention of the Government . The State rationing of industry also had another effect . According to the rules of the consortium , materials were divided among its members according to the amount of stock originally procured by each . This provision absolutely overlooked the varying needs of different manufacturers . Contraction or extension of industry had no influence upon the amount of raw material each would receive . Consequently , those manufacturers wishing to develop and extend production were handicapped for want of supplies ; those who for one cause or another diminished output had a surplus of supplies on hand . In the one instance , progress was discouraged // and in the other , extravagance and waste stimulated . The result of the consortium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficiency . Before the war there was practically no difference in the price of cotton in France and England . The first restriction in French importations raised the price of cotton in France until it was twenty-four dollars higher per hundred kilograms than in England . In 1918 . this difference increased as follows : 20 Consequently , in the month of September the French cotton mill had to pay 223 francs ( $44 ) more for cotton than the English mill , and for a material which in both instances came from the United States . This difference upon a free market , subject to speculation , might have been explained ; but under a State regime especially designed to avoid such a condition , it had no justification.21 Other instances of a like effect upon prices are cited in a report issued by the Marseille Chamber of Commerce upon November 26 , 1918.22 In one instance the // French Government bought rice , a food necessity , from England and resold it in France at an increase of 140 per cent upon the purchase price . Many such occurrences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In another case the State imposed a price upon requisitioned distilleries for a liter of alcohol , of one franc ( .20 ) , which was 100 per cent above the usual price . It then forced the distilleries to sell this alcohol , on the State 's account , to the manufacturers of colors and varnishes , to perfume makers , and to vinegar manufacturers for three francs and a half . In the meantime , Switzerland was selling exactly the same alcohol for forty-two centimes ; the French price was over eight times greater than the Swiss price . Newsprint paper , six months after the armistice , was selling for 45 francs per 100 kilograms in England and 200 francs in France , a difference of over 400 per cent . During the war , the Ministry of Armament by an interAllied agreement obtained a monopoly of the American market on linters . This made the French Government the sole purchaser , which should have permitted it to operate under extremely favorable circumstances . Private manufacturers , given such an opportunity , certainly would have profited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time the French Government decided to make a purchase , the price of linters went up one or two hundred , to fall again as soon as the Government had finished its buying . In another instance the French Government was offered Plata tallow by private firms at fifty-eight dollars a ton . Asserting that the price was too dear , the Government itself negotiated for the tallows at a supposed price of fifty-six dollars a ton . Despite this appearance that the State was a better buyer than free com- // merce , its price amounted to a great deal more , for the fifty-six dollar quotation did not include expenses of purchase operations , such as cablegrams , and of administration which a broker includes in his prices . These the Government can write off into general budget expenses , falling upon the taxpayer . Furthermore , this State purchase included wastes which the brokers eliminated ; moreover it was of frozen fats , lacking the qualities of standard tallow . These instances demonstrate the effect of the consortium policy upon French industry and upon the French consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French consortium policy seemed to be on the verge of causing an economic drought . This , at any rate , appeared to be the opinion of the Chamber of Deputies , when it voted M. Victor Boret , the Minister of Agriculture , out of office because of the height to which prices were continuing to rise . On the 18th of July , 1919 , the Chamber voted the following order of the day : The Chamber , believing that the price of living has diminished one-half in Belgium since the month of January , 1919 , That the price of living has diminished one-quarter in England since the armistice , That it has not ceased to increase in France since the same date , Judging this result to be due to the economic policy of the Government , Passes to the order of the day . // Of the most serious importance was the evident intention of the State to continue this consortium policy as a permanent basis of industry after the war . Suspicions to this effect were aroused by the stipulations inserted in consortium contracts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Clementel , Minister of Commerce , was accused by many of conceiving of the methodical and administrative reorganization of French industry in which individual industrial enterprise would be completely suppressed . Moved by this prospect , the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce , in a session upon March 20 , 1918 , adopted this resolution : Whereas , declarations publicly made by persons in touch with the Ministry of Commerce give the impression that the consortium system is to be considered . . . as the basis of economic organization after the war ; Whereas , if it is legitimate and in certain cases necessary that , during hostilities , the public powers , . . . control importations , and the apportionment and the sale of certain products , it can not be admitted that the Government may profit from the patriotic self-denial with which the French producers have inclined themselves before the necessities of the hour , to prepare an even partial dispossession of enterprises which their capital and their labor have successfully established ; Whereas , the regime of consortiums , represented as a pact between the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter by an administrative measure and without any possibility of discussing the solutions presented to them , since any firm which does not adhere to the combination finds itself immediately deprived of raw materials ; Whereas , this regime , which completely overthrows the conditions of national economic life and which places those upon which it is imposed in a situation of inadmissible inferiority toward other French producers , has been adopted without Parliament 's having been called to deliberate upon it , and without its having thought best to consult preliminarily the // qualified representatives of the great economic interests of the country such as the Chambers of Commerce and the professional groups ; Whereas , it would be easy to show by precise and suggestive examples , that the results obtained up to the present by the consortiums in functioning are far from encouraging , that , on the contrary , they bring to light the insufficiency and the errors of State management , the excessive expenses which it involves for a feeble return , its absence of elasticity , and its incapacity to adapt itself to the changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest energetically against every measure tending to give as its basis , for the economic organization after the war , an industrial " corporatism , " which would certainly be a costly and sterile regime of incompetence and indolence.24 IV After the signing of the armistice , reconstruction needs added another aspect to the commercial policy of the Government . Attention now became centered upon the general prohibition of importation and exportation , a restriction which the Government was forced by public opinion to raise in the spring and summer of 1919 . This policy was followed for two reasons : First , a flood of importations would completely unsettle the state of exchange , already so unfavorable to France ; second , the protectionist argument carried to the extreme , namely , French industry must be allowed to reconstitute itself , unhindered ( as well as unaided ) by foreign competitors . The unrestricted entrance of foreign products into France would overwhelm French manufacturers . The solution of the first of these arguments , which had some weight , appeared BUREAUCRACY AND STATE SOCIALISM to rest in the arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the total exclusion of foreign products . The second argument had little foundation . France needed foreign products to rebuild her devastated regions ; she needed foreign machinery if she was to manufacture products for exportation . To create the tools herself for her rebuilding would be fatal to the success of reconstruction and of foreign trade . A few examples of the working of this protectionist policy will demonstrate its weakness . Occasions were numerous during the armistice of French manufacturers whose factories had been ruined in the war , who wished to reestablish their industries immediately . Machinery formerly purchased in Germany now could only be obtained in the United States where , largely in sympathy for France , the orders were filled . But to import it , permission from the French Government became necessary . At the manufacturers ' request , the Government replied that such an importation was impossible without the payment of a seventyfive per cent ad valorem tariff . In addition , a certain number of French manufacturers must declare to the Government that this machinery was not to be found in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage French production ! It was useless for the French manufacturer to point out to the Government that machinery had to be obtained before his factory could be reopened ; and that if he could not import it from , the United States , it would take five years to build the outlay and to manufacture the machinery in France . If the importation were allowed , the machinery could immediately produce the materials which France sorely needed and which could not elsewhere be obtained . Furthermore , hundreds of work- // men would be given immediate employment . These arguments were vain , because the consortiums or the inter-ministerial committees had decided that French industry must be " protected . " The Government was obdurate ; for the sake of a theory French industry was forced to lose invaluable time and effort in manufacturing implements which foreign merchants already had on hand and at a cheaper figure than the French could hope to produce them . There was one other alternative ? to do without ; and in most cases , this was what French industry was obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theory , was the difficulty which the Ford Automobile Company had with the French Government . During the war the Government had purchased 4,500 commercial automobiles from this company which , on account of the armistice , were never used . They were stored in Bordeaux , new , and ready for use . According to the terms of the Ford Company 's contract with the Government , the former had a privilege of repurchase , with the Government 's consent , of all unused cars at half the original price . The company now offered the Government the full price for the cars , plus a profit of 10 per cent , the 70 per cent ad valorem customs duty , and the luxury tax . From the financial standpoint alone , the revenue resulting to the Government from such a transaction would have been nearly 9,000,000 francs ( $1,800,000 ) . The Government would have recuperated the sum of 8,437,000 francs which it had paid for the cars , and the French automobile dealers , who held the Ford agency , would have made a gross profit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars to French firms . The sale would have immediately resulted in the termination of warehouse and upkeep expense of the ma- // chines . It would have partially alleviated the great transportation crisis , then paralyzing French industry ; it would have employed thousands of dealers , mechanics and repair-men , and in a number of other ways it would have contributed to the stimulation of French industry . But the Government did not see fit to accept the proposition , saying that French automobile manufacturers would soon fill all French needs . Incidentally , M. Loucheur , the Minister of Industrial Reconstruction , had considerable interests in the Citroen Company ; but so far this company has not supplied automobile needs , although it enjoys considerable profits on those it does sell . Monopoly privileges apparently are enjoyed as much by Government officials as by mere business men . In any case , it was better to allow several thousand automobiles to continue in a state of forced idleness than to permit an American firm to profit by their utilization ! Another regrettable incident arising from this policy followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . Canada had had an important section at the Fair , and her merchants took a large number of orders upon samples exhibited . When they attempted to fill them , the French Government refused the permission to import the goods . Upon the intervention of Sir George Foster , the Canadian Minister of Commerce , the Government responded that the " Lyons Fair , being purely a local enterprise , the Government could not grant it special favors . " Le Temps , " always a vigorous opponent of the statist policies of the Government , commented as follows upon this instance : // As a result , it is no longer necessary for individuals , manufacturers , agriculturists or merchants to be aware of their needs and to supply them , at their own risk and perils , by exercising their knowledge , experience , and ambitions for the country ; but following such and such resolutions , taken in such and such administrative bureaus , these needs are now catalogued , estimated , submitted to regulations ; always changing , however , in a manner to dominate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? deemed unreasonable . The Mayor of Lyons , M. Herriot , responded to the Temps ' comment , in part as follows : The Canadian incident is only an example . Merchants and manufacturers , highly qualified , eagerly attempt to obtain results ; but a small anonymous bureaucracy completely annuls their efforts . The Minister of Commerce makes solemn engagements ; he promises some liberties ; but no engagement is kept . Clients whom we have gained with great difficulty are going away irritated and exasperated . . . . We want less talk and more action . We do not ask that they be interested in our work . That would be an indiscretion . But at least , they can let us workl26 Aside from the evil effect upon the internal welfare of the country of the Government control of importations , it was creating an international difficulty . Allied merchants were very glad to trade with France . They were not prompted solely by commercial motives ? though the French Government seemed to believe this was their single preoccupation ? but by sympathy . They desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Government , indiscreetly , it ' seemed to them , refused their cooperation , it was only natural that they should look for markets elsewhere , Germany included . Not only was France los- // ing Allied trade , but she was losing markets which she could have had in Roumania , Greece , South America and the Orient . If she would not import their offerings , she could not expect to export to them . Consequently , France was beginning to face an economic isolation . V As we have already seen , the commercial policy of the Government was by no means acquiesced in . Industrial sentiment , save that of a few large firms profiting from the benefits of a monopoly market , was wholly against it , and carried on a vigorous campaign for its repeal . Among political parties , only a few Radicals and Socialists upheld it . Moderate Republicans to Royalists were its strenuous opponents ? opponents not only of this restrictive regulation but of statism in general . The National Association of Economic Expansion , after an investigation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials necessary to national industry . In regard to the effect upon reconstruction , the Federation of the Architects of Northern France , upon whom such a task would naturally fall , declared : Private initiative . . . is the only means for the rapid reconstruction of our cities and villages.28 Similarly , after hearing the report of its President , M. Maurice Charpentier , the Chartres Chamber of Commerce resolved that " the return to the commercial // and industrial life of before the war be effected with the briefest possible delay . " 29 The French Society of Political Economy , an organization including many eminent economists , likewise accused the Government not only of violating the most fundamental economic principles , but of awkwardly and inefficiently controlling industry . At a meeting of the Republican Committee of Commerce and Industry , attended by 500 delegates from all over France , upon May 14 , 1919 , its President , Senator Mascuraud , denounced Government Statism in these words : We have seen how the State buys , manufactures , and sells . We have seen , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production and that of the products , so much so that the cost of living and the level of salaries always increase without satisfying any one . The experience is conclusive . There is only too much of it . Enough of State socialism and of monopolies ! If we wish to heal our wounds , to meet the needs of a formidable budget and to overcome our foreign indebtedness , we must have liberty in importations and in exportations , liberty in production and in circulation , and liberty in exchange . The Union of Economic Interests also declared that " every one who wants to work for the resumption of economic life conflicts with the State . In place of encouraging good intentions and of aiding initiative , it discourages the one and paralyzes the other . The State wishes to regulate everything and to control everything : importations , exportations , production , distribution , and exchange . " 30 In addition to these business elements , Labor entered // the lists against one feature , at least , of this policy . At a meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held on July 22 , a resolution in favor of Free Trade , the suppression of custom barriers , and the free entry of raw materials and manufacturers , was adopted by a vote of ninety-one to sixteen . This was a somewhat radical departure for this Labor organization ; but it was strongly supported by the Socialists ? all of the Socialist papers demanded the suppression of the exportation ban ? and the city dwellers generally , who were sorely afflicted by high prices . For the public , L ' ( Euvre and Le Progres Civique denounced the theory of Protection and demanded the institution of Free Trade . It seemed that only the extremity to which the Government had carried the theory could rouse France from its traditional belief in this doctrine . Under the great pressure which the most divergent interests were bringing to bear upon the Government , it gradually removed some of the restrictions upon the liberty of commerce . On January 20 , 1919 , a decree was issued removing the bans on exportation from all but 140 articles of the 654 upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services under the supervision of the Minister of Finances , a move of economy . A further decree , announced in Le Temps , on May 14 , 1919 , removed the ban still more on exportations , only nineteen articles remaining subject to the prohibition . These included many important items such as live animals , chemicals , metals , and paper . These removals did not apply to importations and consequently did not allay public criticism . But upon the 17th of May , a letter was published written by M. Loucheur , Minister of Industrial Reconstruction , // to M. de La Tremoille , who had laid a resolution before the Chamber asking for freedom of importation of raw materials , manufactured articles necessary to French export trade , and agricultural machinery . In this letter , the Minister stated that the Ministers had decided to ask the President of the Republic to sign a decree almost completely restoring the liberty of importation so far as raw material was concerned ; and after adjustments with the Allies , another decree would be issued , more nearly suppressing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forsaken the desire to fasten this policy upon peace-time industry , closed by saying : We are thus completely in accord with you . . . upon the projected resolution which you have presented .. " Perhaps to the surprise of the French public , the Government kept its word , for upon May 20 , the Journal Offciel published a decree allowing the importation of principal raw materials necessary to the resumption of French production . Further decrees were announced on June 19 , July 7 , and 8 , which suppressed nearly all prohibitions on importations , about a dozen articles remaining . The value of the decrees , however , was largely overcome by the fact that they increased certain tariff rates on needed commodities to an almost prohibitive height.31 Thus it was about eight months after the close of hostilities before the French Government surrendered its control over private enterprise . There may have been some justification to its policy ; but the dangers in which it resulted appear much greater than those it avoided . 336 BUREAUCRACY AND STATE SOCIALISM VI The defects in functioning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously attacked . In addition to those opposed to the war policies of the Government , there are many equally opposed to the ordinary extent and mode of operation of the Government administration . The remedy which the business interests , including the upper bourgeoisie , urge , is the return to private enterprise of activities now directed by the State . As it is extremely improbable that the State will ever surrender any of its present industrial prerogatives , the success of such a remedy seems slight . Realizing this unlikelihood , the anticollectivist movement has limited its demands to the prevention of future State extensions into industry . The Union of Economic Interests , embracing about seventy-five commercial organizations , is the leader in this movement . It was organized in 1909 with 201 insurance syndicates as its basis . Its purpose is to combat State Socialism and to defeat any candidate for Parliament who does not promise to vote against measures increasing it . In the elections of 1910 , the activities of the Union succeeded in pledging 366 Deputies to vote against the creation of new State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it has proved an energetic organ in carrying on the Union 's campaigns . On the 15th of December , 1913 , it assembled the presidents or delegates of forty great national groupings of commerce , industry , and agriculture , to inaugurate an anti-statism program for the 1914 elections . As a result of its activities , 270 Deputies declared themselves against the extension of Government activities in indus- // try , 127 opposed the program set up by the Union , 29 were for it with reservations , and 164 were doubtful . At a meeting held at Paris upon the 12th of May , 1919 , the Union adopted another program which pledged itself to " formal opposition to the establishment of new monopolies , to any attempt at collectivist socialization , to any encroachment of the State upon services of a commercial and an industrial character , to the operation by the State of services at present leased to individuals , and , generally , to any interference of the State in the management of private enterprise . " 32 This program was submitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each candidate was asked to subscribe to its principles . As a result of this canvass and of the election , it was found that 377 of the elected Deputies approved the program ; 35 made reservations to it ; 96 were doubtful , and 81 were opposed to it . Despite the activities of the business interests , the statist movement seems to be growing and the evils of the bureaucracy remain unchecked . The Government has decided to convert all of its munition plants into industrial factories , operated upon a peace-time basis . It is not apparent why these plants were not sold to private firms . Bills have been introduced into the Chamber for the Government monopoly of insurance 33 and for the monopoly of petrol ; the Chamber has voted a bill providing for Government participation in the profits and eventually in the operation of mines ; likewise , a bill monopolizing industrial alcohol has been . // passed . Agitation for Government ownership of hydraulic power is strong . In the latter part of June , 1919 , M. Albert Thomas , supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nationalization of the railways . Despite the distinction which some Socialists attempt to create between Statism and Socialism , " ' the French Socialists with the left wing of the Radical-Socialists are the supporters of statist policies and projects . The statist activities of Parliament are being strenuously objected to by moderate elements because of the fact that the powers of Parliament should have expired in 1918 , if the war had not prevented it . It has no right , according to them , to impose its will upon an unconsulted country . This issue doubtlessly was one of the most important in the elections of 1919 . Anti-statism is always certain to be the rallying cry of moderate Republicans . They will be supported by many collectivists because of the antipatriotism and Bolshevism with which the chief supporters of Statism , the Unified Socialists , are associated.35 CHAPTER XI GOVERNMENT BY INTERESTS AND EXPERTS The increase of State control over industry , of which the period of ' the war has given an illuminating example , is regarded by many Frenchmen as an inevitable if not a welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old freedom and to the policy of laissez faire , this new school after reorganizing the basis of the present State , wishes to extend its functions . It offers one of the two real suggestions for remedying the defects of French administration ? decentralization by service as opposed to decentralization by geographic regions . ' Finally , it goes much farther and suggests an entirely new political framework for the State . French administration , as previously noted , owes many of its faults to the concentration of power at the head of its various departments . Thus the Cabinet Ministers are not only part of the political government responsible to Parliament , but they are chiefs of all the public services belonging to their departments . Dependent upon them , a great number of directors , underdirectors , chief of services and inspectors exist , whose // powers are more or less extensive according to the Ministry ; and who , under the authority of the Ministers , act as agents of the Government , exercising , as a French legal authority ' has stated , the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , these officials are directly controlled by , and at the absolute mercy of , the Government ; they have no other than a political status . The Government exercises complete freedom in choosing or removing them . Beneath these political agents are several hundred thousand ordinary employees performing the most diverse functions , many of whom , on account of their organization , already enjoy a relative permanency of position . Decentralization of service means that Government officials , particularly Government agents , will no longer be placed under the command of department Ministers , but only under their control . The increase of public services is forcing this evolution , for it has become an impossible task for the head of the department to command what should be done in every ease where a decision is necessary . In the interest of the good management of the public services , initiative in decisions must be left with under-officials . With a decentralized administration , ' the heads of departments will only refuse to approve measures taken by subordinates when they are in violation of law , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a power of revocation will still rest with the central authority but it will be strictly limited to the above purposes . Thus the decentralized agent will have an initia- CONTEMPORARY FRENCII POLITICS tive , as well as a comparative freedom from officious interference of department heads now frequently exercised for political or other reasons . ' As a necessary complement to the granting of initiative must go the personal responsibility of the agent . Otherwise his freedom would be unrestricted . At present the Minister , as head of the department , is alone responsible to Parliament , a responsibility which often amounts to nothing at all . Under a thoroughly decentralized administration , every negligent or careless service would imply a personal responsibility of the official concerned for which he could be held pecuniarily liable . The creation of a common fund by the organizations of the functionaries , supplied with a share in the profits which the French public services make , would furnish a source r GOVERNMENT BY INTERESTS from which their joint responsibility could be met . According to Professor Duguit , the supporter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the public services and the protection of the individual against the omnipotence of Government authorities is to be reconciled . This theory further implies the supplanting , by technicians and experts , of those officials in the Government service who are incompetent and who owe their appointments solely to political influence . The greater number of public services are technical ; and , to be efficiently operated , they require skilled direction . If initiative and responsibility are to be placed on subordinate officials , they must be granted to those who , by training and aptitude , are able to exercise them intelligently . This applies likewise to officials at the head of administrative departments . Hence this is a movement to place the expert in the Government , and to place it upon a scientific basis . II The participation of subordinate functionaries and of experts in the control of the public services already exists to a very limited extent . By a law of 1896 the national service of education , through councils elected largely by teachers themselves , became partially decentralized . The University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each faculty of the same university . Although the deliberations of this Council must be submitted to ministerial approval , nevertheless they practically control the direction of the university concerned . By decrees issued in January , 1910 , M. Millerand , // then Minister of Public Works , provided for the representation of the employees of the Posts , Telephones and Telegraphs in the regional councils of discipline , in the central council of discipline , and in the central promotions council . The personnel also choose delegates to serve with the Minister , the department directors , and the chief of the service . As members of M. Clemenceau 's last Cabinet , M. Claveille , the Minister of Transportation , was a railroad man ; M. Victor Boret , Minister of Agriculture , was a grain merchant ; M. Loucheur , Minister of Reconstruction , was a financier and manufacturer ; M. Vilgrain , Undersecretary of State to the Food Ministry , was a miller . Thus even a few heads of departments have been selected because of their technical knowledge and experience . The Chambers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to a law of April 9 , 1.898,5 the Government is obliged to consult their national assembly , which meets every two months in Paris , upon all matters or changes considered in commercial , tariff , or economic legislation . The Government , however , is not compelled to follow its advice . Of more importance , the Chambers may themselves operate certain public works and services , especially those involving ports and navigable ways ; and they may conduct technical education . They may also issue certain denominations and quantities of paper money for local circulation . A special Chamber of Commerce GOVERNMENT BY INTERESTS tax , 6 granted them by the Government , insures their financial support . Except for one other , the President of the National Assembly of the Chambers , was the only technician appointed on the Committee of Importations , a body in general charge of war importations . The Chambers are also represented in the Regional Committees of Economic Action and in local committees charged with adjusting terms for ships requisitioned by the Government . On April 7 , 1919 , Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were authorized to organize themselves into seventeen groups , according to economic regions . M. Clementel , the Minister of Commerce , was responsible for this grouping . It was his idea z to associate these Chambers in a common action , giving them general power to supervise the economic reconstruction of the different regions of France . A regional committee was to be formed in which the Chambers were to be represented according to their numbers . This committee was to " receive from the Ministry of Commerce a letter of service accrediting it to the different public administrations , " implying that the committees would be given a part in the administration of the regions and departments in which they were located . The powers which were to be accorded to these purely professional bodies were left vague ; and although the idea is received with favor in regionalist circles , it remains a question whether the Government will ever willingly give these bodies any amount of effective authority . Aside from the Chambers of Commerce , other profes- CONTEMPORARY FRENCH POLITICS sional bodies are supposed to be consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , s Consultative Chambers of Agriculture were created to give advice upon subjects of agricultural development and coordination . This function , when now carried out , is left to the smaller unions of agriculturists . During the war , they have been represented upon many committees such as those of Economic Action and of Agricultural Labor . They were likewise charged with distributing fertilizer to wine growers . An old law further created the Consultative Chambers of Arts and Manufactures , but it is lifeless . According to a decree of 1894 a Superior Council of Commerce and Industry comprised of appointed members was established , which the Minister of Commerce was obliged to consult upon tariff laws and treaties of commerce . A similar function was delegated to a Superior Labor Council , composed of seventy-two members , twenty-nine of whom were to be elected by labor unions , twenty-nine by employers ' organization , one by cooperative societies , one by the Chamber of Commerce of Paris , one by the Bourse du Travail of Paris ; there were also to be three Senators and five Deputies upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has done a great service in supplying the Ministries of Labor and Commerce with invaluable Labor information , and in penetrating them with a new social spirit . A Consultative Committee of Railways is also in existence , which now has seventeen representatives of the Railway Unions upon it . During the war the Ministry of Armament constituted permanent committees // of conciliation and arbitration , composed equally of employers and workers . In the Government committee of Chemical Products , there were four specialists who were chemical manufacturers , and two merchant specialists in chemical products . In the Central Committee on steam engines , there were five business men ; on the Inter-ministerial Committee charged with determining the national machinery needs , there were five representatives of employers ' organizations using machinery , three machinery dealers and two manufacturers , as well as other representatives of the business world . ' Presumably in response to the demand for competence in Government , the President of the Council announced on July 16 , 1919 , the formation of an " Economic Council charged with assuring the preparation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of products and supplies of any nature , the diminution of the cost of living , the repression of speculation , the development of economic life and the reconstruction of the liberated regions . " This council was to meet at least once a week . It was presided over by the President of the Council . It included the Ministers of Public Works , Commerce , Industrial Reconstruction , Agriculture , Colonies , Labor of the Liberated Regions . Its resolutions are submitted to the Council of Ministers . To this Economic Council ( which , as will be noted , is nothing but a division of the Cabinet ) is to be added a commission charged with framing propositions to present to it . This commission is partially of professional // composition , for it contains : ( 1 ) the Undersecretaries of State of the President of the Council , and of the Ministries of Public Works , Finance , Interior , Food Supply ; ( 2 ) the commissioner of maritime transports ; ( 3 ) the president of the Section of Economic Studies of the Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inter-ministerial commission in the Liberated regions ; ( 5 ) three representatives of employers ' organizations ; ( 6 ) three representatives of labor organizations . This commission will receive opinions from municipalities , agricultural , industrial or commercial groups , workingmen 's and employers ' organizations , and cooperative societies . The experts thus delegated to a share in the administration have been too few , according to the reformists ; their powers , when exercised at all , have been merely consultative and of no binding force ; and they have always been outweighed by non-expert officials , actuated largely by political motives . The decentralization movement must permeate the regular Government services with this professional element which the Government has been in a partial degree forced to take into its war administration . It must increase their numbers and their power , and ultimately , it must place the complete control of these services in their hands . In the spring of 1919 the Ligue des Gouvernes was organized by Maxime Leroy , Henri Dumay , and others to agitate this development . The purpose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the improvement of the administrative system . One of its brochures says : " We ( the public ) are never consulted upon the organization or the improvement.of services which at every instant and in a serious manner affect our interests and our welfare . Arbitrary // power , negligence , and carelessness , blind and injure us . It is to reform this state of things that the Ligue des Gouvernes is founded . By its specialists of every order , it will study . . . the improvements whose need is revealed on every side , and will pursue their immediate application by every legal means . " The League announced that it would concern itself with all of the public services which the State now exercises ; and its definite purpose is to improve the service of the railways , telegraphs , post offices , telephones , omnibuses , street cars , taxis , water , gas , electricity , ports , navigation , State and other monopolies , bridges and roads , tariffs and octrois , tax collection , municipalities , burials , ministerial offices , police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and education . The more comprehensive purpose of the League is to work out a plan of organized cooperation between the Government employees and the general public through great professional groupings . The organization of public employees is an essential element in the decentralization of administration and in the establishment of their responsibility . Of equal importance is the necessity for developing some relationship between the general public and the functionaries to insure the proper use of their decentralized power . As a matter of fact , this plan of administration is founded on syndicalism or guildism , that is , upon numerous autonomous groupings , cooperating with each other , independent of a continued Government intervention . According to the proponents of this theory , this is really taking authority away from the State and conferring it upon experts , responsibly and efficiently organized . // III The organization of Government functionaries has met the same resistance in France which it has experienced in other countries . France has two laws upon professional organizations : One , the law of 1884 , which permitted the organization of professional associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional demands and which stated " that professional syndicates have as an exclusive object the study and defense of economic , industrial , commercial and agricultural interests " ; the other , the law of 1901 , which permitted the general organization of " associations " among those excluded from the benefits of the law of 1884 . These associations were intended to be of a social and cultural nature rather than for the furtherance of strictly economic improvement.10 The Government has repeatedly refused to interpret the law of 1884 to include Government officials . By circulars issued in 1892 , 1895 , 1897 , and 1904 , different ministries denied all requests of their functionaries to organize themselves into syndicates . In 1910 the tribunal of the Seine declared that Government officials could not form professional syndicates such as were provided for in the law of 1884.11 The case was upon the legality of a syndicate formed by post office employees . But the Council of State in 1909 had ruled // that functionaries might form associations under the law of 1901 . The chief practical difference between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably adhere to the General Confederation of Labor , in order to increase its bargaining power . The Government did not relish demands for increased wages nor , in ease of their refusal , strikes and the disruption of public services essential to the nation . A functionary , in accepting public employment , entered into a special status carrying with it the obligation to insure the continuance of governmental activities . The functionaries ' retort has always been that if theirs is a special status , which limits them in this respect , it should offer offsetting compensations in permanency of position and adequacy of income . Despite the illegality of syndicates among the postal employees , they persisted in maintaining their organizations and in 1909 they adhered to the C. G. T. The school-teachers ( institute urs ) , a majority of whom it is said are Socialists , were pioneers in the functionaries ' struggle for the privileges of the law of 1884 . Their campaign was begun in 1887 when they first conceived the material advantages of organization . Upon Government intervention , organized labor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result of a motion voted in 1902 at a Congress of the Bourses du Travail , a committee on Syndical Education was appointed , composed of six teachers and five workmen . In 1905 , upon the occasion of a great syndicalist movement in France , an open struggle began between the Government and the school-teachers for the possession and exercise of this right . In the same year , the leaders in the " Instituteurs ' " organization in the Seine district were arrested by the Government for attempting // to enforce its recognition ; a year later a project of amnesty was passed and the proceedings against them were dropped . In the meantime a Central Committee for the Defense of the Syndical Right of the employees of the State , the Departments and the Communes , was organized ; while on February 26 , 1907 , the National Federation of Teachers ' Syndicates was created and its statutes were filed with the Government . A year later , the Central Committee addressed to M. Clemenceau , the President of the Council , an open letter exposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the law of 1884 upon syndicates . M. Clemenceau denied this request , stating that the law was framed only for industrial workers , and that the Government would not countenance a movement antagonistic to it . The Government , however , was asked by Parliament to tolerate the syndicates of " instituteurs " already existing , while forbidding the creation of any new group . This modus vivendi existed for a number of years . But finally after the Congress of Chambery in 1912 , M. Briand ordered the syndicates dissolved , accusing them of being centers of political agitation and national disintegration . Some of the teachers obeyed ; others did not , and the members of the Syndical Council of the Syndicate of the Seine were ' again prosecuted . Proceedings were soon dropped , but the teachers ' organizations continued to develop . ' L At present the functionaries , 300,000 of them , are grouped into a National Federation of Functionaries. // They are divided into so-called Amicales , associations of the 1901 type , and illegally constituted syndicates of the 1884 type which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been accentuated by the almost pitiful salaries which French functionaries receive . By all odds they are the poorest paid Government officials in the world . An English official , corresponding to the French grade of redacteur , receives $1,000 a year , while the French employee receives $400 . When he becomes chief of a bureau the English official receives $5,000 ; the similar position in France pays $2,400 . The French Ministry of Marine presented some particular abuses . Candidates for positions are required to be university graduates , but such low salaries are paid ( 9,025 francs for the chief of the bureau down to a third-class redacteur , who receives only 2,375 francs ( $475 ) , that it is impossible to fill the positions , fifteen of them having been open since the beginning of the war . On the 22nd of June , 1917 , the Senate unanimously passed a law extending the civil capacity of professional syndicates by removing some of the restrictions as to property-holding , placed upon them by the law of 1884 . No mention was made of extending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill did not come up for discussion in the Chamber until the winter of 1918 . A Socialist prepared the report upon it , and when it appeared before the Deputies it contained some interesting additions , the chief one of which granted nearly all of the functionaries the right to organize . The Socialists had wished that this right be made universal in its extension to all employees of the state , departments , and communes . But the Chamber , reticent to extend a right which would even include the judges // of the country and other officials upon which the public welfare vitally depended , passed a law on February 21 , 1919 , granting the right to organize to the functionaries and employees of state , departments , and communes , except members of the military forces , the police , the magistrates , prefects and sub-prefects . The Government wished a provision inserted to prohibit definitely the right to strike among functionaries ; but the Chamber , under Socialist impulsion , voted it down . On the 19th of April the Senate voted the Chamber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to organize to those functionaries holding no part of the " public power . " This was an attempt to introduce a principle into the question which the Chamber had attempted to settle merely by a list of exemptions . The Senate feared that the Chamber 's precedent would lead to the easy and gradual repeal of the exemptions until every class of Government official could legally organize . The Chamber , on the other hand , argued that it was impossible to draw a distinction between employees holding and those not holding public power . Secondly , the Senate included a provision to the effect that any Government employee , striking in a concerted effort to stop public services , by that act would become discharged . On the return of the bill to the Chamber , both of these provisions were stricken out ; and on July 18 , the bill was again voted with substantially the same exemptions . The question of the legality of functionary syndicates , however , is largely an academic one . Not only did the organizations among the school-teachers and postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other groups of Government officials organized in the spring of 1919 , and became affiliated // with the General Confederation of Labor . Many accused the Government of a fatal weakness in allowing these wholesale violations of the law of 1884 . The Government itself verbally protested ; but by refusing to increase the unbelievably low salaries of its officials it allowed the greatest reason for organization to remain . On the 8th of March what was known as the " Revolt of the Functionaries " occurred . Three great federations of the public services , the railway men , the functionaries , and workers of the State , took part at a meeting directed by the secretary-general of the C. ' G. T. , and adhered to the Bourse du Travail at Paris.13 On the 13th they voted " that all the administrative employees should adhere as quickly as possible to the , C. G. T. so they might participate in the organization of a more humane and just society . " The " revolt " aroused the fear among public and Government circles that these organizations would now resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insinuation was vigorously denied by functionary leaders.14 This example was followed on April 5 by the General Association of Under-Agents of the Posts which changed itself into a national syndicate affiliated with the C. G. T. On June 9 , 1919 , the National Union of the secretaries and employees of the French Mayors , in its twelfth national congress , voted by 2,200 to 300 to affiliate with the C. G. T. At the same time , the French tax collectors at their tenth congress transformed their association into a syndicate ; and although they did not adhere to the C. G. T. , they opened negotiations with the Treasury employees to effect a union . On May 3 , CONTEMPORARY FRENCH POLITICS the National Federation of State , Department , and Commune employees expressed a desire to adhere to the C. G. T. On the 13th of May at their annual congress at Strassburg , the General Union of Customs Agents , representing twenty-seven regional groups , decided to change their association into a syndicate and to ask to be affiliated in the C. G. T. On the 24th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amicales , " or associations of the 1901 type , voted to join the C. G. T. , and become syndicates by a vote of 170 against 43 . These examples suffice to show the universal organization of French Government employees . With the exception , of course , of soldiers and sailors , it seems that every class of functionary is compactly grouped . The professors in the lycces ' are even associated through the Federation of Lycee and College Professors . The employees of every Government service , postal clerks to policemen , are organized , most of them in syndicates of the 1884 type . If the present evolution continues , they will all be in syndicates and members of the General Confederation of Labor . So far , purely economic demands have occasioned this mania for organization . This the National Congress of Functionaries , meeting on July 6 , 1919 , illustrated . At that time the immediate realization of salary increases by July 20 and the recognition of the syndical right in every class of officials were demanded . The Congress also invited " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the C. G. T. before October 1 .... " Due to their insistent agitation , the Government , upon July 8 , asked credits for // salary increases . Upon the 10th , the Chamber voted necessary credits so as to advance 200 francs to all functionaries , to apply on future salary increases . To the Socialists and to the revolutionary Syndicalists , the organization of Government employees means quite another thing than the amelioration of living conditions . To them it is an essential step in the assumption of power by the proletariat . To the advocates of decentralization , on the other hand , this organization is welcomed as the basis of administrative reform . By no means going to the length of the Socialists , they would extend the powers of functionary organizations to a direct participation in the management of public services . For example , the secondary school-teachers , through their officials , would be empowered to decide the character of education , rather than accept policies dictated by the Ministry of Education . The Ministry might lay down a few general principles to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative and independence in carrying on the work . Doubtless , such a system of decentralization would go to the extent where the heads of the Ministerial departments and even the Minister would be chosen from , if not elected by , the educators themselves . Competence and democracy , it is urged , would then be instilled into French administration . The organization of French functionaries is an assured fact ; the next step , and one of equal importance to the success of the decentralization movement , is to bring them into relationship with , and make them responsible to , the public , whose interest they must serve . So far no one has offered a practical way of bringing this about . If it is not solved , any amount of power granted to great organized bodies of public employees // risks serious abuse . The public services must always be administered by officials directly responsible to the electorate . The present elective method , or that of ministerial responsibility to Parliament , to a certain theoretical extent , supplies this need . Without the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees any considerable independence in the management of the public services . IV There are those who do not stop with the revision of French administration . They would install professional competence in the legislative as well as in the executive branch of the government . In other words , they advocate professional representation in Parliament . Their conception of the State is that of a mere " cooperation of public services , organized and controlled by " 16 the governing power . With the evolution of society these services are being continually diversified . The governing power which administers these services , has no legitimate basis and there is no such thing as sovereignty.17 The gouvernants govern because they are the strongest , and the gouverns are governed because they are weaker than the gouvernants . But // the governing force is under the obligation of exercising itself through the liens of social solidarity and in the interests of all . Furthermore , the old political basis of the nation is passing away ; social units such as the home and geographic political entities are being supplanted by groupings founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual assistance . This grouping of French professional interests is defined as " the movement by which all of the different social classes tend to organize themselves and to give themselves a definite juridicial structure for the defense of class interests and for the conciliation , by collective contracts , freely consented to , of divergent interests . . . . Thus two governing forces actually appear in France : the numerical majority of male citizens , and the professional syndicates . " " As the function and the composition of the State have changed , the government must be directed by professional groupings , fitted for the task by strength and competence . In other words , the homme de politique must give way to the homme des affaires ? the politician to the business man . Maxime Leroy in his very remarkable book , Pour Gouverner , devoted to this new conception of government , says that the old State is based upon regalian conceptions ; it is monarchical . Political philosophers have hitherto addressed their observations to it . Their arguments against State Socialism apply only to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of democracy has been false . " The wisdom of number , " he says , " the equality of individuals , the idea of the General Will ' inspiring the role of citizens // by a sort of quasi-divine illumination , the infallibility of the people in its assemblies and of the Government deliberating in its councils . . . who still dares conscientiously to defend these democratic forms with a disinterested voice ? " 10 The principles of the Revolution are unsound , but they still are retained in government ; they must be supplanted by doctrines recognizing the fundamental factors in modern life . " At our head , we ask fewer drivers of crowds , fewer professional leaders , fewer pontiffs ; but more observers , endowed with an experimental sense ; fewer masters of our spirit , but more stewards , capable of assuring the management of our common goods . . .. " 20 According to M. Leroy , we must be skeptics in government , we must be penetrated with the experimental method , which is as necessary to politics as to science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetuous to command . What the State needs is the participation of productive forces in its control ; and he firmly believes " that the association of producers , employers , employees , savants , artists , each of these groupings remaining in its original sphere , without a false confusion of interests , is destined to regulate the traditional antagonism between the gouvernants and the gouvernes , between workers and employers , between those administrating and those administered . " 21 Professional groupings are becoming stronger and are demanding an effective part in the Government . Both laborers and employers are insistent on the destruc- 360
