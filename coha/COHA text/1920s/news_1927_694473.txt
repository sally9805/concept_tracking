" It is always sobering to ponder on the fate of a great civilization , past or present , but is n't General PARSONS a little more pessimistic than neces-sary ? Sky scrapers may be buried some day deeper than the subways , but will they be alike inexplicable to MAcAuLit 's New Zealander of the distant future , as the General fears ?

Thirty years ago they were the proud backers of the Bohemian Boat Club . which was cleaning up rival oarsmen year after year . One of the members of the Atalanta crew , defeated like all the others , happened to be a librarian as well as an oarsman . Appointed to take charge of the Webster Free Library , he found himself living and working among his conquerors and their countrymen .

They feared the absorption and destruction of their individual enterprise . But their work was recognized , and much more money was put at their disposal .
