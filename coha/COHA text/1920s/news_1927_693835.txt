txt The Bellanca monoplane , piloted by Clarence Chamberlin and Lloyd Bertaud. will take off for Paris on Saturday , if the weather permits , despite the warning of Ambassador Herrick of antiAmerican feeling in Paris . The flight was postponed until then partly because of weather reports , and partly out of deference to French feelings of sorrow over the loss of Captain Nun . gesser and Captain Coq . The decision to fly was : eazaed about 11 o'clock last night , after a conference between Charles A. Levine , President of the Columbia Aircraft Corrorathm ; G. M. Bellanca , designer of the plane , and the two pilots . When word of Ambassador Herrick 's message was received at the hangar late yesterday , all work stopped for a moment , in astonishment at this unexpected development . Mr. Bellanca did not believe it at first , and then he stepped to the telephone and Tun NEW YORK TIMES Washington dispatch was read to him .

The statement , as made public later by Mr. Levine , said : " This morning I said that the finest tribut we could pay to these brave men would be to take up the attempt where circumstances had compelled them to lay it down . I was merely echoing the thoughts of our pilots and Mr. Bellanca , and after the conference tonight we are all of the same belief . " We would not have undertaken the flight if the attempt of Captain Nungesser and Captain Coli had been successful , out of regard to their courage . As the matter now stands , the flight is a challenge to all fliers and after preparations , where all other considerations have been sacrificed to that ox safety , we hope to make the next attempt .

" Pilots Would Risk Paris Flight . The fliers themselves were more outspoken yesterday when they were told that if the Frenchmen succeeded their flight would be called off . Last night they hoped to leave early tomorrow morning . And with the reception of Mr. Herrick 's message they at once declared that more delay would merely give the French time to prepare another plane . " We wo n't go to Paris , " said Bertaud , " if they do n't want us . We 'll fly over and around the Eiffel Tower , touch our wheels at Le Bourget and then go to London and land at Cobham Field . " Chamberlin nodded . " Those are my sentiments , " he said . Both pilots declared that they hoped Nungesser and Coli were safe aboard some steamer or in some part of Newfoundland . They attributed the failure of the fight to weather conditions . " We know that Nungesser and Cell are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed under the conditions they could . " Bertaud said . " But that is no reason why we should lie down now . They tried to get the jump on us and we hoped for their success as much as anyone in France did . Now is our chance . Let 's go . " When it was hinted that their reception in France might not be the friendliest , both men scouted the suggestion . They feel that if they succeed the French people will give them as great a welcome as was planned for Nungesser and Coli here . Final Tests Made of Plane . Earlier in the day before the Ambassador 's message and the report of bad weather conditions in the Atlantic which came to the local Weather Bureau from the liner Olympic in the affected region , it was hoped that tonight would be the big night .

Charles A. Levine announced that the Coast Guard was sending the cutter Modoc to the ocean " corner " at 50 west longitude , 42 north latitude to act as a sea " pylon . " At that point . 1.250 miles due east from New York , the course turns in a northerly direction . The Modoc is now off New England on ice patrol and is probably steaming toward the position where she will await the fliers . Weather Turns Against Fliers . All this bad been done and crowds on foot and in automobiles were arriving at the field to find out the hour of the take-off and wait through the night for it . Then came the adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy clouds , east winds and fogs were along the course the fliers would take . The Weather Bureau added that another area of low pressure was moving eastward from the Central States and in a day or two would be over the Atlantic , while the fog and cloud conditions which have prevailed for two days over the east coast were getting slowly under way further to becloud the path over the waters . These conditions may mean a delay of days , in which it is hoped by the fliers that the situation in and around Paris may have changed for the better also . Life preservers and a pneumatic boat , similar to that with which Commander Byrd has provided himself , arrived at the hangar today and a place was found for them in the fuselage . A. D.
