It is the custom of the Ku Klux Klan in recent years to make an annual splurge in Washington , D. C. , so that mere laymen can gaze on the marching " brothers . " This festival on Pennsylvania Avenue has come to be a barometer by which the relative annual potency of the K. K. K. may be judged . In the eyes of " Mr. Average Citizen , " who thinks of crowds in terms of the several 100,000 Manhattanites who welcomed Gertrude Ederle and who fought to see the corpse of Rudolph Valentino , the K. K. K. performances of the last two years in Washington have been duds . In 1925 , boosterous Klansmen talked of a parade of 100,000 ; 32,000 marched . Last week , a mere 30,000 arrived , out of an expected 200,000 . <P> The Washington police were prepared for the convocating Klansmen . Every policeman on the force was called on duty . A regiment of Marines guarded the U. S. Treasury Building . <P> But all the Kleagles and Grand Goblins climbed out of stuffy trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks . At their head was Hiram W. Evans , Imperial Wizard , dentist of Dallas , Tex . Shrewd businessman , he smiled , wondered if all those behind him had paid their dues . There were floats : " Miss 100% America " and " Little Red School-house . " During the next two days , the mighty Kloncilium met to ponder on next year 's schemes , probably to re-elect Imperial Wizard Evans for another four-year term . The Klan program now has four aims : <P> 1 ) Collection of a fund of $50,000 for construction of a radio station for " true Americans . " <P> 2 ) To defeat the movement of the " Italian Romanists " to make Christopher Columbus 's birthday a legal holiday . <P> 3 ) Renomination and re-election of Representative Albert Johnson of Washington , so he can continue to be Chairman of the House Committee on Immigration and fight for restricted immigration laws . <P> 4 ) To embarrass as far as possible every man in public life who voted or worked for the World Court . <P> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts moth balls in his uniform after a parade , that perhaps history will sneer at him , at his fiery crosses and his spooky Klonvocations . But , at least , in the encyclopaedias where uncolored statistics can cover a multitude of hokum , he and his several hundred thousand " brothers " will get Justice , find Pride . Perhaps he was disillusioned last week on looking into the three new supplementary volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , wherein able Arthur B. Darling , one of the rising young assistant professors in history at Yale , disposes of the modern Ku Klux Klan in a cool , curt sketch : <P> " On Thanksgiving night in 1915 William Joseph Simmons , preacher , traveling salesman and experienced promoter of fraternal orders , gathered some friends on Stone Mountain , near Atlanta , Ga. , before a ' fiery cross ' and administered the oath of the ' Invisible Empire , Knights of the Ku Klux Klan . ' A state charter gave corporate rights to his organization . As Imperial Wizard , Simmons could hold office for life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kloncilium , council of supreme officers and delegates from other states . . . . Simmons met financial difficulties . The order would have languished had not new impetus been given .
