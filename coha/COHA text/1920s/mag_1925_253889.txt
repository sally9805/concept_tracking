Tilden II make his arms into pointed complements , while his body-the sum of their two right angles-remained a straight line that bounded from point to point of an oblong parallelogram of green turf , other factor of this geometric contes was Manuel Alonso , the Spaniard , whose returns went into the net , over the baseline , whose wrist played him false so that Tilden defeated him with ease , 6-4 , 6-4 , 6-1 , winning the New England Tennis Championship .
