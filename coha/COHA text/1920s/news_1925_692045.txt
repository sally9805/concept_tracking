txt One more effort will be made by the French Government to obtain Boon a settlement of the foreign debt situation . As soon as the Government has finished its examination of the American proposal for a provisional arrangement it will address a counter-proposal to Washington . and it is no exaggeration to say that on the reception of that counter-proposal will depend in very large measure the whole financial future of this country . M. Caillaux is still keeping up a bold front . Yesterday before the Finance Committee he stated that the Treasury situation would enable him to meet the big calls clue at the end of this month , and today he declared privately that he hoped to be able to carry on until the end of the first week in December . But before the Government , then , there is no other road open than the road to inflation . If that road must be taken , it will be guaranteed by all kinds of precautions . It will be limited . There will be provision for amortization . But once more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal limit of note circulation and the limit of advances by the Bank of France to the State will have to be raised . There seems to be no other way out , except it is the more drastic way which M. Caillaux has always declared he will not consent to ? the Socialist way of the surgical operation of a capital levy . If the counterproposals which he is preparing to lay before America for a debt settlement obtains a favorable reply there would result an immediate betterment of the situation which would affect the exchange . Confidence would be established and the perils which are now facing the country might be staved off . Without that confidence , however , the battle which M. Caillaux is fighting for and the maintenance of normal ordered procedure in the solution of the problem can not be won . Confers with PaInteve and Maivy . Today the Finance Minister had a long discussion with the Premier and M. Malvy , President of the Chamber Finance Commission , on the whole situation of the Treasury , on measures to be taken to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposals which will be made to America and on measures to be taken when Parliament reassembles to meet the future . The conversation was of a secret character , but there is no secret about its Portent . All three men intend to be present at the radical and Socialist Congress which opens at Nice tomorrow , the Premier , however , attending only the final session . It is there that the battle for the conservative normal methods of finance , for which M. Caillaux was called from his exile to employ for the re-establish ment of the country 's position , will be fought . When his Government was turned out of office on the ground had he allowed the circulation to exceed the legal limit M. Herriot and a large part of his party had been all but , if not quite . converted to the Socialist thesis that the only salvation lay in a capital levy . If they were nearly convinced then , they are more convinced today by the situation which the past - six months of " conservative normal finance " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods can effect nothing . M. Caillaux 's business at Nice will be to persuade the party to give him a last chance . If he fails there , or later In Parliament . then the Herriot Government with the Socialist program is what : ' cry one in Paris expects . The situation which has to be faced is simply this : How can France meet the cost of administration of her international debt , which would absorb two-thirds of her budget ? In the six months at the Finance Ministry M. Caillaux has , in the opinion of his Socialist critics , failed to demonstrate that it can be done by normal means . His consolidation loan has not succeeded . His " balance budget , " which was really M. Herriors budget , and full of holes , has had more holes torn into it by the Moroccan war . His settlement of the foreign debt , which was to have reestablished confidence , has not materialized . There is nothing for it now but the knife , say M. Herriot and his colleagues , and to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not come into the open at Nice , but it will be fought first there , partly in secret , and then two or three weeks hence in the Chamber . Caillaux Is Still Confident . No one can yet make any prophecT as to who will win . M. Caillaux is full of confidence . He fights best when beset with difficulties , and the difficulties are certainly piling . But his alternative is undeniably a weak one , for It inevitably must sooner or later be a resort to the money press for relief of the Treasury , and not all the precautions with which he may surround that step can prevent its unfavorable reception , even by his own party . He is credited by his friends with holding wonderful plans up his sleeve , but all his reputation for wizardry is scarcely likely to withstand for long the bare presentation of his failure during the last six months . That he has failed has not been due to his fault , but that provides the Socialists with the even stronger argument that the situation is past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
