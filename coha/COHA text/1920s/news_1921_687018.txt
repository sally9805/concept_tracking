txt At Staint Hermine , . down in the western province of Vendee , where he was born , Georges Clemenceau , the " Tiger , " this morning took part in the unveiling of a statue of himself . For weeks the event has kept Paris worried . for the 80-year-old statesman who carried his country to victory in the war was expected to take this unique opportunity to reply to all the critics of his conduct of the peace negotiations and pronounce his final Ard on the problem* that face his country and the world today . He did . In a speech which mSttes few direct references he pronounced his sentence on his critics and on his successors . In some trenchant passages he took a fly at . the statesmen and leaders of America . He gave to the Republican doctrine of . AmericanIsM some especially shrewd blows . In the little village for some days past it has been impossible to find a room , so great was the crush of eminent men and simple peasants who wished to take part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coverings fell from the group ' statue which represents Clemenceau standing on the parapet of a trench with five poilus watching him from below , the veteran leader stood silent , regarding his effigy . Then he turned to the Pr ? sident of the local Council and said : " It 's simple , but it 's fine . " The speeches then began , but as the first , speaker opened his lips an incident occurred that troubled the serenity of ithe-gathering . Photographers and movie men had grouped themselves in front . of the platform . On them the Mayor of St. Hermine threw himself . " None of that here , " the Mayor shouted , but the photo ' graphers held their ground . " Tiger " Displays Ills ' Temper . When Clemenceau arose to speak they turned their cameras full on him . The old man , whose temper was ever of the shortest , turned red with rage . " I do n't want photographers here , " he cried . " This is n't an exhibition . Clear , out or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Tiger ' ? turned in anger to the prefect of the province . Look here , Monsieur le Prefet , " lie said , " why are you not turning these people away ? if they wo n't go , throw them out by the neck . ' ' ? The photographers and the prefect saw that Clemenceau was in earnest and the former discreetly withdrew . Then , in a voice which carried tar , the former Premier and Minister of War read his carefully prepared Speech . It began with a glorification of France . This was not the day for the praise of any individual . France willed the victory and France had won it . To the soldiers of his own Province of Vendee and to the soldiers of France he paid tribute . The victory had bi:ten won , but ho ' , ' had it been used ? Wherever he had gone in the world since it was won he had found the name of France honored and reverenced . It filled men 's minds with enthusiasm . " But we know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Allies . We would not be worthy of ourselves if we forgot it . It is not less apparent today that proof came for the need of alliance as soon as their arms fell from the hands of the enemy . I felt that on the first day and prompt confirmation has not been lacking . " The danger of falling back into old formations became at once apparent . Our War of the entente would have been a derisive adventure if it had not forever slammed the door on such a wornout policy . Says All Need Each Other . " We have all need for each other on an equal footing . It is on the prosaic calculation of our interests in the full , light of day that the future ought to be founded . We have all given too much of ourselves to the common cause not to keep our respect for it , and we feel profoundly the necessity for unity in times of difficulty . " Does not the size of modern war forbid any one to think of militarism ? Our conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will never lose a chance of giving proof of that . Let there then be no hidden thoughts representing us as an eventual danger , and , above all , let none make the mistake of making a show which could be mistaken by Germany to be an advance of sympathy at compound interest . " Germany sopght domination by an extortionate race . As long as she has ' mot abandoned this foolish dream , the alliance can not weaken , except to the detriment of that one among us who gives way . Our watchword should be this : Neither to dominate nor to be dominated ; peace of equity for all the world . " That was the rile for the French and all democracies to seek to fulfill. he continued , and in spite of everything ' that had passed , the regime of free government remained for the future definitely assured . For France the especially right policy was tto live in peace and justice or else she would perish . The " Tiger " then turned on his sueeessors with a virulence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently can justify . " At Versa he said , " we made Germany bow the knee . How , then , has she been allowfcl to forget it ? " The war criminals were still untried , engagements were broken , the signed treaty had riot been kept and reparations had not been paid as promised . Into these matters Parliament must inquire , he said . Criticises American Policy . Then , turning to the question of France 's security , he indicted in no measured terms the American policy of aloofness from Europe . " For the maintenance of peace , " he said , " our allies felt the necessity of offering us their concurrence , without waiting for the French negotiator to ask for it . With this object , they made engagements which one day they will be reminded of . Thanks to the Treaty of Versailles , their acts at this moment are being decided ? by ours . " I see that at this mesnent every one Is magnificently busy about assuring the peace of the world in the Far East . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we are manifestly of the world , and the Pacific Ocean is a considerable way away , while our frontier is near to Germany . Why not , then , recognize that all just causes are rigorously bound together ? " The Washington conference might find in the actual state of affairs a fine occasion to redress the faults of execution which are today apparent . More than ever the interests of peoples are intertwined . The appeal of France should be heard by all to assure a durable condition of peace in Europe , without which nothing can be established . " America , wishes universal . peace as much as France and England . That was the meaning of her intervention on our side against Germany . What a strange epilogue , then , if she had summoned the representatives of civilization only to tell them of her disinterestedness in the cause of humanity for which she had spilled so much blood . That could not be . No one , in truth , can refuse to consider the French question from the same point of view as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should make the attempt , all peoples would not be long in disavowing him . For the circle of human solidarity never ceases to grow , and our contemporaries are beginning to learn to fear for themselves when they have given others cause for fear . " With these involved words of admonition to the Harding Administration , Clemencenu then went on to speak of the economic results of the war . His teAt gave him plenty of opportunity for critical reference to Lloyd George and Millerand for the Spa and other agreements and the negotiations with Germany . ST . HERMINF.I , France , Oct. 2 ( Associated Press ) . ? Georges Clemenceau , France 's war Premier , at the unveiling of a monument depicting him in his well-known little slouch hat and Sur-rounded rrounded by poilus facing the Germans in the trenches , today ' delivered wha , some observers considered to he his valedictory to French public life . Others , however , considered it as interpreting the " Tiger 's " re-entrance into t1.3 active political arena of France . " Let us remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep from substituting by vain words the acts which are expected of the country . Let us remember France 's motto , ' Live in the Peace of Justice or Perish . ' " " Remember " was the keynote of M. Clemenceau 's speech throughout . " Victory , " continued M. Cleinenceau , " was a victory by all the Allies . But as soon . as the enemy was disarmed the trouble commenced in the Entente . At Versailles we bended Germany 's knee . Why has she been permitted to forget it ? We .. old her signature to undertakings which count no longer . Yesterday we were the victors . Let no one place us in the situation where we ask whether we still are victors . " I am not here to accuse any one . Evil came from the fact that chiefs with the powers of subordinates wielded control that had to be controlled . " We showed supreme weakness ? we lacked nothing , neither in . right nor in power . It is not too late to say that reparations and securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German , and that France renounces nothing of what is due her . " Louis Klotz , M. Ignace , Andre Tardieu , who were Ministers of Finance , Military Justice and Liberated Regions in the Clemenceau Cabinet , as well as Deputies Mandel . Deschamps , Simon and Denise and Senator Jeanneney were among those present , all of them being members of the French Parliament . M. Clemenceau 's speech , in view of the announcement that M. Klotz will interpellate the-Government respecting its financial poly , is regarded AS significant .
