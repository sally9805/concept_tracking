txt Four years ago Dr. SUN YAT-SEN published a book , " The International Development of China , " in the preface to which he said that " unless the Chinese question " can be settled peacefully another world " war greater and more terrible than " the . one just past will be inevitable . " He proposed an ambitious plan to develop the resources of the country " for " the good of the world in general and " the Chinese people in particular . " All commercial nations , he said , were looking to China " as the only dumping ground ' for their overproduction . " He maintained that the proper development of China would " create an unlimited market for the whole world . " He had a vision of a New World in the economic sense . International co-operation to modernize Chinese industry would strengthen the brotherhood of man . He saw in it " the keystone in the arch of the League ' of Nations . " China must have 100,000 miles of railways , 1,000,000 miles of macadam highways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved ; her rivers electrically harnessed , . her cities supplied with public utilities , her waste places reforested , her minerals brought to the surface , her arid lands irrigated ; and Manchuria , Mongolia , Sin-Kiang , Kokonor and Tibet must be colonized . He had made an intimate study of the topography of the country and the transportation possibilities . Dr. PAUL S. REINSCH declared that the views were statesmanlike , but advised that his program be brought within the limits of " the present world 's resources in capital . " Secretary REDFIELD said that " it " would take billions of dollars to carry " out even a small portion of your pro " posals , " and suggested that only developments which would attract private capital should be undertaken for the present . In reviewing the resources of China , Dr. SUN YAT-SEN spoke of " the unlimaccLiron ; , , an , d . coal fields of Shansi and " Chili , " believed that China 's output of coal could be made four times that of the United States , described China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copper were to be found " in great quantities . " ' China has often been called the treasure-house of the world . Baron VON RICHTHOFEN , the explorer , estimated that there was enough coal in China to last the world.several thousand years . Its iron , says one statistician , is " almost as widely diffused as its coal . " Bich veins of copper have been supposed to abound . Prospectors have hinted that China is enormously rich in silver and gold . There has undoubtedly been much exaggeration about her mineral resources . This is the view of the Commission on Commerce and Marine of the American Bankers ' Association , which has just completed an economic survey of the country . China 's coal reserve is estimated to be between 40,000,000,000 and 50,000,000 , - 000 tons , or one-eighth of that of the United States and one-third of that of Great Britain . But China has proportionately more anthracite as compared with bituminous coal , one to three , whereas for the rest of the world the ratio is one to eight . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . She probably has one-quarter of the reserve of the United States , four-fifths of that of Great Britain and one-third of that of France or Germany . But China leads in antimony , being credited with half the world 's total . In the production of tin China ranks next to the Malay States and Bolivia . " In copper , " says the commission , " China is apparently poor . " Large amounts are imported from Japan . It does not pay to work the deposits of lead and zinc in Hunan and Yunnan . While China is one of the largest silver-consuming countries , her production of the metal is insignificant . Her gold deposits are scattered and sparse . But she has abundant limestone for the manufacture of cement , which is fortunate , because what forests she has are inaccessible today . " Unless transportation is facilitated , China , " it is maintained , " can not expect to compete " with other nations in mineral produc " tion , nor develop basic industries which " produce bulky commodities made from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing . Eighty-five per cent . of her people are engaged in agricultural pursuits . It is said that " new movements , tendencies " and reactions in China represent the " immediate interests of only 10 per cent . " of the population . " With a good elementary distributing system China could be self-supporting . In the production of cotton she is exceeded only by the United States and India . She is the greatest tea-producing country . Her exports in silk products were valued at $116,051,720 in 1921 . In the same year she exported eggs and egg products . worth $18,769 , - 871 . In sugar and cattle raising she gains rapidly . - last ten years China has attracted attention by her industrial activity , and yet China has not developed " one horsepower of its won " derful potentialities in hydroelectric " power . " In cotton textiles China shows great promise . Importations are still necessary , but some of her mills pay dividends of 50 per cent . In transportation the country is backward .
