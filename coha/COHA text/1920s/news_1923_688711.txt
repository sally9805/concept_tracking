txt The most important event in the world last month , from the British point of view , was the funding of the American debt . It was not the chief topic in the daily press , as the English , when they are thinking most deeply , are the least talkative . But iii all boards of directors and business clubs , the one dominant theme has been the Anierican debt and the American policy toward Great Britain . ' This debt , which has now ' been put upon a new basis , is a.much more staggering burden than any ' Englishman will admit . It is $500,000 a , day for 62 years . It is a a% tax on all who pay an income tax and upon their children and grand-children. *It is a grand total of $.11,000,000,000 , for which no value . has been received by Great Britain , except satisfaction of having been loyal to her Allies and of having broken the power of the German empire . Eleven Billions ! All gone up in smoke ! A Debt of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt at all , but one that must be paid ! That is the British opinion of it . The yearly payment of $150,000,000 is more than half the total amount spent in Britain on education . It is one-third as much as the war pensions . It is twice the cost of all the foreign and colonial services . It is three times the cost of all the prisons and police in the British Isles . It is a staggering load , even to these strong British shoulders ; and'it comes at a time when $5,000,000 a week is being spent on doles for the unemployed . On the whole , the British opinion about the debt agreement is paKtly one of pride and partly one of disappointment . The average Britisher is proud that he did not try to dodge the debt  --  that he did not whine for a moratorium nor , try to pay in a debased currency . The British people know that they signed this bond in the fury of war , and that they must pay the bill to the uttermost farthing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit so freely during the war . There was a mass meeting during the week at which a demand was made for the impeachment of Lloyd George ; but the nation as a whole does not approve of this . The British people know that they made n great mistake . They lent too much to their Allies . Altogether , they lent $1 ; 500,000,000 ; and they know now that the bulk of it will never be repaid .
