txt Confirmation of the connection alleged to exist between the Russian Soviet Government and the American Committee for Russian Famine Relief of Chicago , which has been endeavoring to set up a nationwide organization in this country through the names of Governors , Senators , Bishops and other prominent men , is contained in the special report submitted to President Harding today by S'eeretary Hoover . President Harding asked for a report on the general status of the efforts to relieve the Russian famine , after an attempt had been made to enlist his support for the newly created American Committee for Russian Famine Relief of Chicago , which is not affiliated with the American Relief Administration , headed by Secretary Hoover , but , on the contrary , is affiliated with the new Russian Red Cross , whose directing head in this country is Dr. Dubrowsky , an agent of the Soviet Government , and successor of Martens , the former unrecognized Soviet " Ambassador " to this country .

Secretary Hoover 's report , after itemizing the resources of the American Relief Administration amounting to a total of $52,599,700 and enumerating the organizations represented in supporting the work of the American Relief Administration , deals with the group of committees purchasing their supplies through the American Federated Russian Famine Relief Committee of New York . Of this latter group the report says in part : " One group of these committees , comprising the ' Friends of Soviet Russia , ' the Soviet Russian Medical Relief Society , the Technical Aid to Soviet Russia and some 200 affiliated organizations , whose activities are under the general direction of Dr. Jacob Hartmann , are frankly communistic committees , appealing to the communistic and Socialist sections of the United States and ' sending their supplies to the Communist authorities in Russia .

The American Federated Russian Famine Relief Committee has apparently secured $350,000 in cash and some $200,000 in kind from both the above groups . " After describing the method of distribution Secretary Hoover 's report informed the President that " the pathetic gratitude of the Russian people is impossible of description . " Tile Friends of Soviet Russia , " and other Bolshevists in this country , according to evidence that has reached Washington , however , are far from grateful .

Secretary Hoover 's report follows : " Dear Mr. President : " I am very glad to respond to your inquiry as to the general status of the effort to relieve the Russian famine . " The American Relief Administration was appointed by you to distribute the Congressional appropriation ; also to distribute food , clothing and , medical supplies from a number of other sources .

" The American Relief Administration extended its work from children in other parts of Europe to children in Russia in September , 1921 . Until the passage of M. : Congressional appropriations on Dec. n and Jan. 20. and the receipt of the gold contribution from the Soviet Government on Jan. 10 , it was dependent Upon its reserve of charitable funds , and confined its work to children and transmission of food orders . It had gradually increased its servie4 up to fettling 1,20 ( 1.000 on the 1st of January . - " The larger resources made available at the first of the year permitted a program of distribution to adults and the provision of seed .

Distribution . " The American Relief Administration operates under agreement with the Soviet authorities of last August which has secured the release of American prisone ? s and so far proved by experience to give protection to the personnel , anti initependence in actual American distribution .

" The neck of the bottle In relief to the drought area is port facilities and transportation inside Russia . It is impossible to determine at this moment what quantities can he handled because the maximum pressure upon ports and railways will not occur until the large arrivals during this month . Already the Soviet transportation authorities have requested that the rate of dispatch ( now 5,000 tons daily ) should be slowed down owing to their inability to handle such large quantities , and already there have been congestion and delays at some points . American transportation and port experts have been sent in the hope of increasing the volume of movement . Both Finnish and Polish Governments have offered free railway transport during the past few days , and some increase can be had by using their ports .

Other Agencies Relieving Russia , " The American Relief - Administration has made no appeal for general " public charity to Russia . I have not believed that any adequate solution was possible through dependence upon such resources , In view of the overwhelming need inatussla and the great necessities of our home charities . On the other hand , no one would wish to discourage or to compete with any legitimate effort to alleviate suffering , no matter how small . I have considered at all times that American charity to all countries should be distributed in the name of America , under active American ' personnel . In the early Fall , under your suggestion , arrangements were settled for co-ordination between the various American charities then interested in Russian relief , with a view to assuring the efficient handling and distribution of the supplies under American direction inside Russia . The growing in. tensity of the famine has enlisted the interest of additional organizations , and stimulated the creation of many new committees through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The organizations appealing for charity in America may be classified into several groups : " ( a ) Those organizations whose con , tributions are distributed in Russia by the American Relief Administration and who are represented upon the central re , lief staff at Moscow .

The totals so fur - furnished by this group are shown above . The Council of Churches , the Southern Baptist Convention , the National Lutheran Council and the Volga Valley Association are all engaged in strengthening their resources . The Jewish. - Joint .

I append a list of its membership . I especially commend to you its officials and would add a further word upon the staff of over one hundred Americans in Russia who in the famine region are themselves enduring the greatest of hardships and a re showing an ability and devotion and a courage worthy of our best traditions . The pathetic gratitude of the Russian people is impossible of description and the millions of lives saved will be indeed a sufficient recompense to the American people for the very great sacrifices they are making to render this service possible . Yours faithfully , " HERBERT HOOVER . " Attack on hioover . One of the latest attacks on Secretary Hoover was in the Voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ , in which M. J. Loeb , Secretary of the Chicago branch of the " Friends of Soviet Russia , " said , in part : " A situation developed which even the all-wise Secretary . had evidently overlooked . In spite of all his crafty work to keep the great friendly sentiment of the American people in general toward Russia from crystallizing and taking active form , another organization calling itself the American Committee for Russian Famine Relief was formed . Relief was formed to raise funds and materials , particularly foodstuffs , from the American people generally . This organization is officered by the Liberal element and announces a policy of propaganda for the recognition of the Soviet Government , both economicallyand politically ; Its ? distribution will be through the Russian Red Cross . Senator France of Maryland is one of the sponsors of the organization and already ten United States Senators , many Congressmen and State Governors and hundreds of city Mayors , clergymen and educators , sensing the tremendous favorable sentiment of the American people , have climbed onto the band wagon and have accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner was informed of this new move than he got busy again and has been attempting to kill the organization in its birth . " How genuine was the " sensing " is evidenced by the fact that many men who lent the use of their names have declared they did not understand the real character of this committee when they consented , to have their names used as members of the " Advisory Committee " printed on the committee 's letterheads : Reports from Russia agree that it is absolutely necessary for the Bolshevik ' to get immediately a large stock of corn in order to . feed the Red-Army , the ordinary commission and men working for . the State , or run the risk of another peasant insurrection by armed requisition of foodstuffs . In one of its latest issues the Krasnala Gazeta threatens the Americans with the revolutionary tribunal in case they are feeding-the bourgeois .
