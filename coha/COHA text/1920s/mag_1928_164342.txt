The aged Cardinal Archbishop of Paris , Louis Ernest Dubois , rolled out excommunicatory thunders last week . He menaced that famed tragi-comic group of Roman Catholics who never cease their efforts to restore the French Royal House of Bourbon and who rally ' round an incorrigible news organ called L'Action Francaise ( TIME , June 13 , et seq . ) . <P> By order of Pope Pius XI , all the Archbishops and Bishops of France joined with Cardinal Dubois , last week , in signing an ordinance which will keep all persons affiliated with L'Action Franaise excommunicated until they renounce their affiliation . <P> This extremely severe discipline was meted out by the Supreme Pontiff in an effort to stop the famed editors of L'Action Franaise , Mr. Leon Daudet and Charles Maurras , from trading upon the prestige of Catholicism in order to gain Royalist supporters . This they have done by spreading a perverted doctrine , namely that Catholicism-which has so often upheld a stumbling royal house-should at this date espouse the lost cause of the Most Catholic House of Bourbon . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy See because it strains the proverbially good relations existing between shrewd , sleepy-eyed Foreign Minister Aristide Briand of the French Republic and suave , far-sighted Pietro Cardinal Gasparri , the Papal Secretary of State . These two statesmen were in perfect accord , some months ago , when L'Action Franaise and all other works of its editors were placed on the Catholic Index Expurgatorius . Still more were they in accord , last week , when the dread weapon of excommunication was drawn against the incorrigible Royalists . <P> Despatches from Paris told that the stand taken by the Papacy has already shorn Editors Daudet and Maurras of perhaps half their Roman Catholic supporters . For example , the smart , swagger group of young Royalist bravos who used to be known as Les Camelots du Roi , " The King 's Newsboys , " because they sold copies of L'Action Franaise have deserted in numbers approaching a stampede . <P> The more orthodox deserters have espoused a definitely antiRoyalist weekly La Vie Catholique and now hawk it in the old fashion , but style themselves by a new title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope . " <P> Over all these flighty , inconsequential doings Excommunicator Cardinal Dubois brooded with troubled dignity last week . He is a prelate in high favor with the rich Anglo-U . S. Catholics of Paris , and he won the general gratitude of Frenchmen during the War by tireless organizing of efficient charities . As a matter of personal taste and sympathy Cardinal Dubois is known to have a penchant for the Royalists , among whom he has numerous close friends . As Cardinal and Archbishop , however , his duty was clear , last week , and he obeyed the Pope 's orders to excommunicate with promptness and despatch .
