If John W. Davis had written the Democratic platform , much as Coolidge and LaFollette dictated their respective platforms , there would be no need to tabulate his opinions separately . The following is the platform which Mr. Davis wrote himself , as compiled from many utterances made here and there : <P> Labels . " We may leave our Republican opponents such terms as conservative and radical , progressive and reactionary , regular and insurgent , to describe or explain the bitter discord that divides their ranks . <P> " We are content with a nobler adjective . It is the glory of the Democratic Party to be known as the party of liberalism speaking for and in the name of the liberal thought of the Country . " <P> Personal Liberty . " The liberty of the individual is being beaten down by the threatening encroachment upon the Constitution of a code of statutes to control the habits and morals of Americans , and the right of man to govern himself is being defeated . <P> " Personal liberty is the doctrine of self-restraint . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last three years ? Every major bill offered or endorsed by the President has met defeat in Congress . . . They are still ' pillow fighting ' on the World Court - something promised two years ago . <P> " . . . We have made a peace with Germany that amounts to a second mortgage , when we should have been in on the first mortgage with the Powers we fought with . <P> " The Washington Conference is hailed as a milestone toward World Peace . . . It is a four-power pact be tween first-rate Powers , who utterly ignore the interest in the Pacific of other Powers , like Holland , for example , who has more interest in the matters dealt with in the four-power treaty than some of the Signatories . Such a treaty and such an alliance do not make for World Peace . <P> " Take the Dawes Report . Today , the Republicans are claiming credit for it . When Mr. Dawes was appointed , the White House issued a statement to the effect that the Administration assumed no responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reparations Commission had asked for him . In other words , the President took the position of assuming no responsibility for General Dawes if his work on the Reparations Commission proved to be a flivver , but placed himself in a position to seize for the Republican Party credit for the appointment , if General Dawes succeeded . Is that courageous or intelligent foreign policy ? " <P> League of Nations . " Stability of the world waits on three things-settlement of the amount of the German indemnity , restoration of order in Russia , and definition of America 's attitude toward the world problems created by the War . <P> " Of course , the League of Nations is not perfect . No human instrument ever is . But there are two things about it-it is a beginning and it is the only one by which it is possible to secure the means for which it was created . " <P> World Court " When the hour of calm reflection strikes , who will deny that the peace of America is by the side of the Permanent Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so great a contributor ? " <P> Russia . " Any compromise with the Bolshevist creed is but a league with Death . " <P> Taxation . Five objects :
