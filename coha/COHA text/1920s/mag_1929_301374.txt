That Ferguson Family . Christmas week in the theatre is a time of plenty but not always one of jollity . While the holly wreaths hang high , the gloomiest producers , among them Gustav Blum , creep out with their dire presentations . Blum 's latest bit of hardware was not so dull as festive critics found it , though not so good as its author , Howard Chenery , tried to make it . <P> At the head of the Ferguson family was Mom Ferguson , a dowdy , cynical scold . Impelled by her stupid and melancholy faultfinding , her two daughters and son rebelled by getting married . Before they did so , one of the daughters stole dresses in the store where she worked and the son made love to a rural chit over his prize-winning plans for a bridge . <P> Alan Ward and Thelma Paige played well in this homely love scene and all the other actors , especially Jean Adair as Mom , did their perhaps too level best to make the rustic trifle seem intense . <P> Falstaff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes and others from his own imagination . In it there are many snatches of tune , lyrics by Brian Hooker , Falstaff 's famed expose of " honor " and a false ending in which Prince ' Hal bows to Anne Page and promises an annuity to Falstaff . Charles Coburn , blown up to a mountainous size , puffs prodigiously as the lecherous old knight who is robbed in a forest and dumped into the Thames from a laundry basket . <P> The Red Robe . It is not customary , when the Shuberts produce a good operetta , for the public to howl so loudly with joy as when " Ziggy , " the maestro and artist , produces a mediocre one . Thus The Three Musketeers , last spring , an elaborate musicale , provoked more ardent cheers than The Red Robe , last week , which was just as good . <P> Operettas , of course , are all absurd and The Red Robe , adapted from Stanley Weyman 's novel , is no exception . Yet it made a good play 25 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gay and gaudy minstrel show for Walter Woolf . In the story of Gil de Berault , who was sentenced to death for duelling and paroled by Cardinal Richelieu in time to achieve fortune and a beautiful partner for the final curtain , there is proper material for brocaded dresses , sword play , romantic songs and fustian foolery . All this has been contributed . Helen Gilliland , an English actress , sings when she drops her white glove and on other occasions . For dancing , there are girls very Chester Hale and hearty . Barry Lupino , British clown , is funny without being dirty . <P> Hello , Daddy ! Ever since Betty Starbuck was seen partaking in the frivolities of the Garrick Gaieties , there have been those who regarded her as among the most pleasing of sarcastic heroines ; yet she never received her due . She does not receive it now , in Hello Daddy ! , though with Billy Taylor and Lew Fields , the publicized star of the show , she does all kinds of things that are engaging . Lew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut Yankee ) Fields , wrote the book ; his daughter , Dorothy ( Blackbirds ) Fields , wrote the lyrics .
