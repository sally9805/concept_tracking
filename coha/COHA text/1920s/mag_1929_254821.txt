Experience has taught most inhabitants of Mexico to be calm in the presence of bombs . Therefore when Chief of Police Edmondo Herrera of the rebel garrisoned city of Juarez , saw a large red bomb lying in the gutter , one evening last week , he stopped his car and inspected it professionally . It was a time bomb , containing about 24 Ibs. of dynamite and set to explode at 10:30 p. m . <P> " Mm ! " said the Chief and he called a soldier , ordering him to take the bomb to the headquarters of General Augustin de la Vega , the rebel commander , and destroy it . The soldier , misunderstanding , left the bomb ticking quietly on General de la Vega 's desk . <P> The General , a busy man , entered his office about 9:30 . <P> " What 's this ? " cried he with an expression of disgust . " A bomb on my desk ? Juan ! " he called to his orderly . " Take this away and throw it in the canal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on his heel and left for a rapid tour of inspection of the defences of Juarez . Nearly an hour later he returned to his office , prepared to plunge at once into the mass of papers accumulated on his desk . The large red bomb was still there , still ticking . <P> " Christ 's Bones ! " swore the infuriated General . " Is this obedience ? Is this discipline ? " <P> " Pardon , my General , " quavered Orderly Juan , " I could not find a soldier to take your bomb to the canal . " <P> A rapid glance showed General de la Vega that the 24 Ibs. of dynamite would explode in just three minutes . Pouncing , he seized the ticking bomb , swept past his expostulating orderly , dumped the dynamite into the nearest horse trough .
