Secretary of Labor James John Davis toured abroad , visiting and nurturing foreign chapters of the Loyal Order of Moose , of which he has been director-general for 22 years .

On important subjects other than Moose and his own Department , he refused , when a Berlin journalist interviewed him last week , to be drawn out . What did he think about the operation of the Dawes Plan ? " I am not an expert on financial situations , " he said . What did he think about the Franco-British naval treaty ? " I am not the Foreign Minister , " he said .
