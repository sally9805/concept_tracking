The name Epstein is famed among artists : 1 ) Because Sculptor Jacob Epstein of London has carved things to which most Londoners violently object ( TIME , Oct. 21 ) . 2 ) Because Max Epstein of Chicago , besides being philanthropist and financier ( tank cars , directorships ) , is an outstanding connoisseur and collector of paintings . Many a Harvard law student is aided by the Max Epstein Loan Fund . The University of Chicago has a Max Epstein Dispensary and Social Hall . Lately Mr. Epstein combined his hobby and his philanthropy . Last fortnight the University of Chicago announced receipt from him of $1,000,000 for an art center where esthetic history and theory will be studied and taught , pundits will lecture , exhibitions will be held . The building will stand near the University 's resplendent new chapel , upon the plans for which a great U. S. artist-the late Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue-was working at the time of his death ( TIME , April 29 ) .               @ @ @ @ @ @
