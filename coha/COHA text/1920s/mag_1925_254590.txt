At Elnora , Ind. , nocturnal yeggs fiddled at the combination of the vault in the Citizens ' Bank . From inside the vault came a faint tinkle of breaking glass . The yeggs gagged , struggled for breath , staggered out of doors , undetected but quite through with safecracking for that night . Next morning , the bank officials beamed with delight at the evidence of foiled foul play and the efficiency of a fragile flask of Lewisite* they had had installed in the vault by a Chicago firm . Other bankers hastened to ask questions , order flasks of Lewisite for their own protection . Other yeggs scowled at the thought of having to add to their equipment-jimmy , " soup " ( nitroglycerin ) , oxyacetylene blowtorch - a gas mask of exceedingly high impenetrability . <P> * Poison gas invented , by Prof. W. Le Lewis of Northwestern University while chief of the Defense Division of the A.E.F. Gas Service . Perfected late in the War , Lewisite never saw active service . Shells containing it are said to have been buried deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk . It is said to be so deadly that a relatively small amount would devastate a large area , making it worthless for crop cultivation for ten years .
