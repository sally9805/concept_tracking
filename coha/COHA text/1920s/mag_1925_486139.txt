T HE RHINELANDER CASE was decided exactly as it should have been . Judge Morschauser 's charge was a model ' of fairness and the jury came to the only conclusion that the facts could warrant . With every outward aspect of benevolence and dignity , Judge Mills , counsel for young Rhinelander , did his best to win the case on grounds of prejudice . He appealed to , the lowest impulses of a bourgeois , male , white jury . He attempted to make it appear that a union was " unnatural " between Rhinelander and a girl who was so nearly white that his young client was supposed to have been unable to detect her trace of color . He emphasized her family 's humble circumstances and even dragged into the courtroom an early misstep of her mother . He solemnly insisted upon the essential responsibility of the woman in the case : if she were not scheming and vicious as well as loose she would have resisted the admitted advances of the young man who , even while he made those advances , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury stood out against the seductions of all these forms of prejudice ; and the judge helped to make possible a verdict which paid no respect to wealth or social standing or even a white skin . And now , it is to be hoped , a decent separation will immediately be arranged between two people who are already divorced by bitterness and public opinion and the ' obscene exposure of their private affairs . T HE ANTHRACITE MINERS accepted Governor Pinchot 's plan for the settlement of the strike , but the operators returned to their ivory tower . Why ? Because the plan contemplated the one thing which the embattled operators will apparently die to prevent  --  the opening of their books to the light of day . Over their dead bodies must we find the true profits of the industry , its capacity to pay increased wages , its capacity to stand a reduction in prices . The Freylinghuysen legislation was designed to get publicity for the accounting records . The Coal Commission in 1923 made that its primary recommendation . Governor Pinchot 's plan rightly treats it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the monopoly is earning , what untold millions those depletion accounts are hiding , all else is wind and foam . How long , Mr. Operator , will your greed keep facts in the dark , and the public in the cold ? rr HE " HEATHEN CHINEE " turns the other cheek ! It was only a few weeks ago that the Director of Public Safety of Cleveland , Edwin D. Barry , baffled by the inability of his police force to solve a tong murder , herded an entire Chinese population to jail . When the murderer finally confessed , the Hip Sing Tong emerged lily-white and immaculate , and proceeded to hold its convention in Cleveland . The meeting was quiet , orderly , and well conducted . The climax came on November 29 , when the tong gave a banquet to policemen , judges , lawyers , and newspapermen of the city . Even Mr. Barry received an invitation . He , however , made it plain to reporters that he would not attend . Since the invitations specified " and family , " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was not room for all the guests in the King Fong restaurant , where the dinner was held . The overflow was taken to another restaurant in taxis furnished by the Hip Sing Tong . Bath Chinese and American food was served . Chinese and American orchestras played alternately . Chinese and Americans were the after-dinner speakers . The Chinese beamed with hospitality and good-will . The Americans essayed ponderous compliments and recalled instances where Chinese had surprised them by acting , oddly enough , just like anybody else ! All of them carefully avoided mention of Barry 's outrage , except to speak in guarded terms of the " late unpleasantness . " It remained for old Wong Bowe , a prominent tong leader , to state names , places , and facts . He exonerated Barry handsomely . After all , the raid had reacted to the greater glory of justice and the Hip Sing Tong . It was all for the best , said Wang Bowe . T                   @ @
