txt One commentator on They Had the recent savage beats City ing down in Macon of a for Victim . man whose ideas of propriety were not those of certain persons as yet unidentified , says of them that " in effect they have tarred and feathered Macon . " The statement lacks accuracy in one respect , as tar , and feathers were not used in this instance , but it is essentially true and might have been extended to ' cover the whole State of Georgia , that part of the country , or even the whole country . For the disgrace of every lynching extends far . " Whether or not the behavior of the man and woman involved in this case Justified reprehension is a question wholly irrelevant to the issues involved . If it did , the treatment they received is no less without excuse than it would have been if they were paragons of all the virtues . If they had violated any laws , the courts of Georgia would have punished them in the way and ? to the degree which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Georgia think the present laws dealing with certain offenses are inadequately severe , it is within their power to pass new laws of whatever sternness they consider right . What is intolerable is that a few individuals , with no authority and no responsibility , should assume the right to say what others shall or shall not do and to punish as they see fit any violation of a. code written in no statute book ? of a code which they well know could not be written in such a book , in Georgia or anywhere else . The city and the State were lynched in the sense that their reputation was injured wherever the news of what was done may go , and the Injury is reparable only by the prompt bringing to justice of those who inflicted it . At present writing Their Method there seems ' to be That no clear proof that . Klan the the men who flogged of BRIGHT were ? mem- : bers of the Ku Klux Klan . They went about their work without the disguise of gown and hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the work itself is exactly such as the Klan often has done , and the doing of it would have been in accord with the purpose for which the Klan was organized and exists . Its members pretend to be the upholders of virtue and defenders of the law ; really they are banded with the object of enforcing their own opinions and prejudices on everybody , and they insolently profess to do what the law can not or will not do in the way of maintaining respect for itself and morality . Inevitably , ' as at Mer Rouge , they are obliged , sooner or later , to make criticism of themselves or resistance to their decrees a crime punishable with death . Civilization wanes in exact ratio with the increase of their power , and wherever they can act witA impunity the result is a state of terrorism verging rapidly into anarchy . To get one part at the truth about the Ku Klux Klan one only has to read r the charges exchanged between two factions of the organization II OW engaged in litigation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , read the fast following stories of the Klan 's midnight activities on lonely roads . Mayor HYLA X , at Doing Just the dinner of the What Detect i v e s ' EnHe Condemns . document Association , added to his speech his now familiar denunciation of the city 's newspapers as the friends and defenders of criminals and the inspirers of crime . That he should talk in this way so often reveals an obsession or phobia , now developed to an extent that well might cause his friends to feel not a little anxiety . Already he probably believes the things of this sort said by him , and any psychiatrist can tell them that this is a grave symptom  --  that a " complex " is in course of fixation and the results can not fail to be distressing . Fortunately the case is not yet hopeless . If the Mayor can be persuaded to abandon the making of general charges against that abstraction , " the press , " and to tell just what papers have done the dreadful things he describes , all still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that he has little to say and few grievances to exploit . He also will find that he ' has himself been doing exactly what he accuses the newspapers of doing  --  has been hurting the city 's reputation by accusing it of maintaining a press of the sort that can exist in no community with honest or decent inhabitants . If New York papers are what the Mayor says they are , their readers are at least as bad . and their readers are everybody living here . Only a criminal population would support a press entirely or even largely criminal . It is getting to be Something rather difficult to keep Almost in mind the fact that . GERALD C HAPNIAN is a Heroical thoroughly bad man , whose right place is in jail . The difficulty arises from the fact that in his battle with the law he shows qualities ? courage , persistence , ingenuity and skill ? which it is impossible not to admire . The result is that ' unless one IS careful one finds one 's self hoping that he Is n't caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the struggta , seems somehow unfair . It appears now that his last escape was not an escape at all , but merely a hiding in the basement of the hospital which he was supposed to have quitted by means of a rope made in the conventional way of sheets . The rope was there , hanging from a window , but its only use had been to mislead the guards . Even when found , cowering in the darkness , weak from his wounds , he yet was able to seize the opportunity , created by the fainting of the nurse who discovered him , to make another break for the liberty he values so much . The temptation is strong to lament that such a man should make . r his abilities and peculiarities such miserable employment as devoting them to theft . There must be some explanation of that , however , and the probability is that he is defective . But it does seem hard that his punishment for his crimes should be increased because of his attempts to evade it . That he hates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks in his efforts to get out is rather to his credit than his discredit  --  from every standpoint except the ' safety of society . -
