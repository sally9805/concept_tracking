txt Taking the financial community completely by surprise , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced yesterday an advance from 3% to 4 per cent . in its rediscount rate . Although a trend toward dearer money has been in evidence ever since the first of the year , most financial observers had believed that an advance in the New York rate was at least several weeks away and that , if made , it would be preceded by revisions by Reserve banks in other parts of the country , other than in Chicago and Richmond . The advance marked the first change in the New York rate since Aug. 5 , 1927 , when it was lowered from 4 to 3% per cent. , and it followed advances from 3% to 4 per cent . in the rates of the Chicago and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks last week . Bankers now are convinced that the nine remaining Federal Reserve Banks will speedily fall into line with advances , and that a 4 per cent . rate will be uniform throughout the Federal Reserve system within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kcE.ment was made after the close of the security markets and its effect on stock and bond prices , and on the money market itself , will be watched with interest this morning . The first tangible effect of the advance was heavy selling of sterling exchange . This usually follows an advance in money rates here , as it tends to cause a withdrawal of American funds from London to take advantage of , a better interest return here . Sterling , which bad displayed strength for a time , sold ' off a quarter of a cent from its high point and closed one-eighth of a cent net lower for the day . The large expansion in bank credit in use in the stock market and the heavy speculation that has continued in the face of only fair business throughout the country have caused predictions for some time that the rediscount rate here would ' eventually be advanced , but in stock market circles varying interpretations were placed on the move . While weight was given to the theory that it was a gesture against speculative borrowing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as presaging an expansion in commercial borrowing , and hence as an indication of improvement in American business . Indications that the Federal Reserve authorities , who had enforced a policy of easy money rates throughout the latter halt of 1927 , had changed their tactics became apparent early last month when the Reserve banks began to sell Government securities on a large scale . This had the effect of taking funds out of the market and made for higher rates . From Jan. 4 to Jan. 25 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reduced its holdings of United States Government securities by $104,000 , - 000 , although the statement issued yesterday showed an increase of $6,000,000 in these holdings in the week ended Feb. 1 . For the twelve Federal Reserve banks combined Government security holdings decreased a little more than $7,000,000 this week , against average decreases of about $50,000,000 a week in the previous three weeks . Brokers ' Loans Increased . Brokers ' loans , which have been widely discussed in connection with rediscount prospects recently , increased $27,000,000 in the last week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks iL New York City is only $3,753.000 below the record high established on Jan. 11 . The present loan total represents an increase of $1,185,819,000 over the figure of the corresponding week of last year . The latest report of the Stock Exchange , which makes monthly announcements of brokers ' loans , showed an increase of $1,294,120,321 for the year in the Exchange 's compilation of brokers ' loans . The extent to which bank credit has gone into the stock market is shown by the latest statement of the member banks of the system , which placed their total loans and investments at an increase of $1,922,609,000 over the corresponding week of 1927 . Loans and discounts are $953.338,000 larger than a year ago . Of the increase in loans and investments , $905.999.000 were secured by stocks and bonds , while commercial loans accounted for only 366.524.000 . Thus virtually the entire expansion in bank credit in the last year has been in loans secured by stocks and bonds or in outright purchases of securities by the banks as their own investment . The expansion in broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking circles . While it has been regarded in some Quarters as an indication that the stock market has been absorbing an undue proportion of credit to the detriment of other parts of the country , many bankers contend that it merely reflects the enormous growth in the wealth of the country and the enlarged volume of new security flotations . Money rates have furnished the subject for most of the discussion in Wall Street since the upward movement was started early last week by the advance in the Chicago rate . In some stock market circles yesterday 's action was welcomed as clearing the atmosphere , on the theory that it is better to have it over with than to have the market under the psychological influence of an impending rate advance indefinitely ; It will not be regarded unfavorably if it means an expansion in the country 's business . The stock market yesterday went ahead confidently , though much of the activity was in specialty issues managed by pools . Several of these issues were bid up to new high levels , although such leaders as United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market has displayed considerable hesitancy for the last week as a result of uncertainty over the credit outlook . Th rate advance caused an unusually close study to be made of the statement for the week of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . The figures , however , showed few changes of importance . The total of bills discounted stood at $114,294,000 , compared with $115,073,000 last week and $76,743,000 in the corresponding week of last year . The bank 's total of United States Government securities was $97,696,000 , against $85,430 , - 000 last week and $54,118,000 a year ago . Bills bought in the open market totaled $103,615,000 , against $79,983,000 last week and 4 ' ) 92,706,000 a year ago . The bank 's gold reserves increased from $992,895,000 to $1,019,451,000 and its total reserves from $1,024,946,000 to $1,052,037,000 during the week . The reserve ratio stood at ' 79.4 per cent. , against 80.8 a week ago and 85.5 a year ago . The credit situation has been uppermost in the minds of Wall Street operators since the advance in the Chicago rate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a similar advance in Richmond . Predictions were made then that the effect would be to draw funds out of New York to the centres where higher rates prevailed , thus making for a firming of rates here and eventually for an advance in the New York rediscount rate . In this connection it was noted that immediately after the Chicago advance , the gold holdings of the Reserve Bank of that city increased $16,000,000 , indicating a flow of funds to that district , while the rediscounts of the member banks at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank dropped $19,000,000 . Money rates here stiffened following the Chicago advance , though in the last few days an easier trend has been apparent . The call loan rate here yesterday declined to 4 per cent . after starting at 4% per cent . Time money was steady . Bankers ' acceptance rates had been moved up slightly since the Chicago advance . Small Margin Under British Date . The advance in the New York rate places it only one-half of 1 per cent . below the discount rate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect . When the Reserve banks last year were maintaining low money rates here through the purchase of Government securities , one of the motives was to aid in stabilizations plans abroad and to facilitate the movement of gold out of this country on the theory that improving the condition of foreign countries would ultimately result in better business for the United States . Large amounts of gold were exported in the latter half of 1927 , culminating in the exportation of more than $77,000,000 in December . Since then conditions have changed , and , with the general improvement in European and South American economic conditions , the foreign situation no longer acts as a deterrent against higher money rates here . Previous to the reduction from 4 to 3% per cent . last August , the New York Federal Reserve Bank 's rate had held at .4 per cent . since August , 1926 . In making the announcement yesterday the bank , as is its custom , offered no elaboration of its routine statement . It follows : " To all member banks in the Second Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the opening of business on Friday , Feb. 3 , 1928 , until further notice and superceding all existing rates , this bank has established a rate of 4 per cent . for all rediscounts and advances . Very truly yours , " BENJAMIN STRONG , " Governor . "
