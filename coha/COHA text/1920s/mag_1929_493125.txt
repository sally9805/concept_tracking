" Faith , Hope and Parity " SOMEWHERE I have heard or read or in vented ? how seldom we know whence phrases come I -- -the description of the Anglo-Ameri ? can manifestation , of friendship as an experiment in faith , hope and parity . And it seems to me that the phrase hits off the situation . There is a definite agreement on the principle of parity , whatever that may mean ; and apart from this rather disputable quality which is to apply to the two navies , there is merely a warm but welcome belief in the co ? bperation and amity of great Britain and the United States . That is enough . More would be danger ? ous . Above all , we must be careful of lending color to the accusation that the English-speaking peoples are united against the rest of the world . It is an accusation that is lightly made . It is fool ? ish . It is mischievous . But it is insistent . Throughout my own visit to the United States ? in the wake of Ramsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have repeatedly been asked the same question : Why do European coun ? tries suppose there is some move towards an Anglo-American alliance , despite official disclaimers ? There appears to he perturbation at the prospect ; and truly , I think , it would be unfortunate were there the smallest truth in the suggestion ? unfor ? tunate because , while I trust the two peoples with whom I am most closely akin will become even more conscious of their fraternity than they are at present , experience and the teaching of history con ? vinces me of the peril of alliances , which can not but provoke counter-alliances , and , therefore , divide up mankind into potential enemies . That is why it is regrettable that a few commentators , both British and American , have spoken of a " pooling " of navies , and have assumed that the cause of prog ? ress is served by imposing an Anglo-American brand of peace on quarrelsome nations . It is our besetting sin to imagine ourselves morally superior ; and this alleged paternal moral superiority is thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifism . There is a slant towards self-right ? : eousness which permits ? nay , dernands ? predomi ? nance , to be used , of course , to the most desirable ends . The fallacy of this attitude is that it omits the important fact that no military or naval might can go permanently unchallenged . Coercion is al ? ways wrong ; and even the ghost of it must not be allowed to creep into the idea of peace . There is no more perilous dOctrine than that of Imperialism , and yet I think I discern an inclination towards Imperialism in a number of articles on the MacDonald visit . I do not complain that the Im ? perialist is a war-monger ; generally speaking he is not ? he is infinitely worse ; lie is a peacemaker . The Imperialist puts on an almost tragic air of self . importance . He is profoundly aware of his " mis ? sion . " On his shoulders lies the burden of this naughty world ; and he bears it pathetically but proudly . " We , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we this in common ? that we are noble in our intentions , that we are peculiarly fitted to guide others , that we are well qualified to govern the universe . " Now , just as no person is good enough to dictate to his fellows , so no nation , or combination of nations , is good enough to dictate to its fellow-nations . Such an interpretation , which is woefully incor ? rect , tends to pervert and misrepresent the right endeavors of the American President and the Brit ? ish Prime Minister . European suspicions must be allayed ; otherwise more harm than good will be wrought . The peace purpose will be scouted , and there will remain only a continental combination against an Anglo-Saxon combination . France and Italy will drop their differences ? or perhaps use them ? to resist the naval " bosses " ; and even Ger ? many will examine , with its neighborse the possibility of forming what is euphemistically called the " United States of Europe . " But perhaps I am putting things in the wrong order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises from the precedent continental condi ? tions and from the congenital continental mentality . That version would be substantially true ; though the shuttle-motion of cause and consequence flies to and fro . While we must take care lest ill-advised boosting of the Anglo-American negotiations con ? firms European diplomatists in their belief that something inimical to their interests ( as they con ? ceive them ) is being concocted , the root of Euro ? pean misgivings lies deep in diplomatic philosophy . In the Foreign Office there is an apparently ineradi ? cable habit of thinking in terms of international groupings . The peoples are simpler and sincerer -- - so that statesmen who aim at popularity must make fine peace speeches . The well trained diplomatist is sceptical , and his job is to double his country 's strength by contracting alliances . Sometimes the same person is both public statesman and secret dip ? lomatist . Let it not be charged against me that I am pess ? imistic or cynical . I seek to explain the confusion of thought , the discrepancy between political pro ? testation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore facts if we would change them . The idealists seldom stop to inquire , for example , what is meant by the word peace . Yet it means things that are diametrically opposed . When it is used at Geneva or elsewhere we should consider whether it is employed as a synonym for security , for the status quo , for the perpetuation of injustices ; or whether it is employed in a positive sense as indi ? cating a new method of removing injustices without having recourse to war , of inducing the war profi ? teers among the nations to give up their ill-gotten ' gains if an impartial body , revising treaties , holds that they should . It is important for us to have definitions ; for otherwise we merely delude our ? selves , and disillusionment will bring a dreadful re ? action . Here is no digression ; if we recognize that phrase-making is not peace-making , we shall try to get behind the expression " United States of Eu ? rope , " and if we get behind that fine-sounding ex ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is ? of an Anglo-American ; entente . The United States of Europe is , for the diplo ? matists , just another synonym for alliances . In the process of boiling-down , of converting vague rhet ? oric into concrete diplomacy , the United States of Europe may become France and its allies . Ever since the War there has been an uninterrupted search for allies ? Jugoslavia , Poland , Rumania , Czechoslovakia , Belgium , and so forth ? to say nothing of the attempt to give substance to the empty phrase Entente Cordiale , and of the Geneva Protocol , and of the demand for automatic " sanc ? tions " against any nation that should offend , and of the whole business of organizing things as they are . This is not a criticism or a complaint ; it is simply a realistic statement . That is how the diplo ? matic mind still works ; and Geneva has been help ? ful to them in that it has supplied a convenient " smoke-screen of peace " without seriously interfer ? ing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franco-German military alliance , to which Poland would be invited to adhere ; and the Little Entente would doubtless be obliged to hang on to the skirts of " the greatest empire since that of Charlemagne . " The idea is not as negligible as it seems to be at first sight . I do not expect it to be realized , but it has been gravely discussed by the most responsible authori ? ties ; and when there is so much to-do about trum ? pery and trivial pacts , apocryphal or ephemeral , which happen to be disclosed sensationally , I do not understand why the biggest proposal yet made in Europe , a proposal whose adoption would trans ? form immeasurably the problems of Europe , should be almost ignored . Perhaps it is because it is not secret . Herr Rechberg , a prime mover in the Franco-German economic accords , who has seen the two countries effect alliances in textiles , potash , chemicals and mete llurg-y , advocates his scheme of a Franco-German military alliance ? a revival of a Charlemagne Empire , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and German news ? papers . He was received by Poincare , by Pain ? leve ( French War Minister ) and by many influ ? ential deputies and senators . General Welsch wentto Berlin and General von der Lippe came to Paris . Whatever the difficulties , the scheme is of more immediate and practical importance than the nebu ? lous and meaningless " United States of Europe . " Or perhaps it is the " United States of Europe . " Anyhow , whatever be the fate of the plan to " pool " French and German ( and Polish ) armies , Europe is already caught in a net of alliances which the League of Nations , in my opinion wrongfully , has accepted as in consonance with the Covenant . There are a dozen pacts which pledge their signa ? tories to consult with each other , to take concerted action against a hypothetical enemy . But this pledge surely makes nonsense of the general prom ? ise of the Covenant that all the countries shall form one League , and shall submit to the rulings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be divided up into separate groups with particular interests to defend . A and B are committed to each other ; then surely C and D are entitled to stand together against A and B. And if there should be a quarrel between A and C what can the League do if B and D automatically range themselves on opposite sides ? The whole European situation is vitally affected by alliances ; they are the basis of European relations , and although I foresee many changes , for there is as yet no crystallization , yet the League can not properly operate while diplo ? matists are interested in alliances . Alliances must be fatal : out of them sprang the great War . . . . But I do not think I need argue , in this place , against the underlying diplomatic theory ; we had hoped to smash the system . Every time I hear of an agreement I immediately look out for the wolf 's ears of an alliance . So do all Europeans of diplomatic training . The man whose job it is to make alliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feint and parry and counter ? naturally imagines , that it is the job of Hoover and MacDonald either to make a real al ? liance , or to threaten to do so . A threat of an al ? liance may be as effective a reply as an alliance . If there are those who are already stammering " European , " shall we not show them that there are greater nations who can respond in English ? A European Federation ? Can it not be capped by a union of the British Empire and the United States ? The point is that when there is the smallest hint of any set of nations coming together ( not in a war ? like way , but for the sort of peace that depends on the ultimate possibility of coercion ) then there is certainly another set of nations who regard their coming together as a diplomatic retort . The utmost caution , then , is essential in avoiding ' declarations that can possibly be construed as im- plying an Anglo-American alliance . There is , and can be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentality the idea is fantastic ; but unfortunately there are , we must remember , many , people who can never understand either the British or the American mentality . The greatest tempta ? tion for orators and writers is to indulge in non sense about the elevated purpose of Great Britain and the United States , who together can give the world a new Roman peace . Peace based on domi ? nation , real or imagined , is precarious ; it must be founded on universal good will . Nevertheless , having written this warning , which I think necessary , I would add that in my view the Anglo-American accord should be maintained in the teeth of all antagonism . Great Britain and the United States have agreed not so much on tonnage figures as on the removal of the thought of rivalry in their relations , political as well as purely naval . Now it is surely incredibly ridiculous to put back the thought of rivalry because it might happen that France and Italy ( let us say ) can not settle their differences . What ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the judgment of a consequence ? We must make our friendship con ? tingent on the friendship of others ? That is a crazy demand ; and although I think it excellent to aim at a five-power accord , we can not let inability to hit that target destroy a two-power accord which can easily be converted into a three-power accord . The more comprehensive the agreement the bet ? ter ; but perfection must not be made the foe of good . The catch-word is parity . England and Amer ica have accepted something they call parity . Now France and Italy want parity , though the naval conditions of the two countries can not even be com ? pared . There is really no parity , when conditions are similar ; and when they are entirely different , parity becomes a foolish word . I lately applied it to the Cubs and the Athletics , which are , as a few readers may know , baseball teams . The Cubs and the Athletics strove for parity ; they had parity in the number of players , parity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parity in every material sense . And yet one team beat the other , for there is no absolute parity in our poor old world .... Yet it does not matter whether there is or can be parity in naval affairs , so far as Great Britain and the United States are concerned , for they can never , like baseball teams , put their parity to the proof . If they have something that looks sufficiently like parity , that is all that even Senator Moses need worry about , for the whole point of the Anglo-American agreement is not in the parity but in the affirmation that if there is not parity nobody will ever find it out in actual combat ! What has already been done ? independently and irrespectively of the results of the January con ? ferences ? is to establish between England and America a state of " faith , hope and parity " ? these three , and the least of them is parity .                   @ @
