Several acute cases of pneumonia have been alleviated by passing a high-frequency alternating electric current through the lungs . The treatments were conducted at St. Mary 's Hospital , Hoboken , New Jersey , under the direction of Dr. H. V. Broeser , X-ray specialist , after the method had been introduced by Dr. Harry E. Stewart , of Yale University , in a series of twenty cases at the United States Marine Hospital , Staten Island . <P> The use of electric currents internally , known as " diathermy , " is no novelty in many diseases , and external heat-producing agents , such as mustard plasters , have been well-known old-fashioned remedies in pneumonia treatment , but this particular application is still in the experimental stage , although several New York specialists are using similar methods . The current is applied through two electric plates , one fitted to the back and one to the chest . The current flows directly through the lungs without burning the skin or causing dangerous fever elsewhere in the body , and is believed to raise the temperature within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the congestion , just as gelatin is melted . After a few treatments the heavy breathing subsides and the lungs are able to absorb more oxygen . Twenty-minute treatments are given twice a day . In unskilled hands the treatment is dangerous , and the use of a direct current might be fatal .
