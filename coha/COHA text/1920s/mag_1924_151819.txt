A prominent personality in the music world celebrated his 60th birthday ; City of Vienna made this the occasion for a gala week . Honors both frothy and substantial were recklessly poured upon the head of Richard Strauss . He was handed the keys of the city , he was created generalissimo of the combined musical forces , productions of numbers of his works-including his earliest and his latest-were arranged , he was presented with a villa erected at municipal expense in the gardens of the palace of the ex-Crown Prince . <P> Strauss ( who seldom does what is expected of him and who shuns the obvious ) was dissatisfied , unhappy . Said he : <P> " I am very tired . I want to go away to my beloved mountains . I am also much depressed by the illness of my son . And if you ask me about music , I can only say that there has not been much since Wagner . <P> " Sincerely speaking , I believe my own work superficial . It is true that new composers have much talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the exception of Eric Korngold , composer of Der Tote Stadt , I can not mention anyone I believe in . I am now working on a libretto by Hugo von Hoff-mansthal , author of The Miracle , which suggests great possibilities . " <P> Is this modesty , ill nature-or bad luck ? <P> Certainly Strauss , at 60 , has behind him a record of achievement that could be equalled by few . At the age of six he was already composing .

One of these , a trifle called Whipped Cream , is now being resurrected in Vienna . <P> His horn Concerto was written for his father , the greatest horn player of his time , who did not like it . His first important work was the tone-poem , Aus Italien , which contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Sunniest Present . " Then followed his famous series of dazzling orchestral tales , path-breaking in form and harmony : Macbeth ( 1890 ) , Don Juan ( 1888 ) , Death and Transfiguration ( 1889 ) , Till Eulenspiegels Merry Pranks ( 1895 ) , Thus Spake Zarathustra ( 1896 ) and Don Quixote ( 1898 ) with its notorious sheep-bleating episode . <P> Strauss has written two musical autobiographies : Ein Heldenleben ( " A Hero 's Life " - modest title ) and the <P> Sinfonia Domestica , which had its world premiere in Manhattan almost exactly 20 years ago . This symphony in one movement represents a day in the composer 's life ; it has three leading themes , representing Papa , Mama and the Baby . The Baby 's theme is the noisiest , and comes to the fore particularly in a spot which represents the
