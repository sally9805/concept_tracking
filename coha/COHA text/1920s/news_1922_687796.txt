txt On the day after the British Government invited the United States , France and Italy to join in an ' investigation of reported Turkish atrocities on the Christian population of Anatolia , it was said at the White House that " the President sees no particular reason why we should participate . " Two weeks later Mr. HUGHES accepted the invitation . Let us not to the marriage of best minds admit impediment ; since the second decision is obviously better than the first , there is no use in speculating on the reasons behind the change . One may observe , however , that a mass meeting held in New York last week showed that the Christian churches of the United States had- a very lively interest in the fact that the Christians of Anatolia are being exterminated because they are . Christians . Realistic persons in Paris and elsewhere are already asking what will come of the investigation . , Mr. HUGHES made it clear , and . properly , that American participation involves no " obligation or commitMent . " He also remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order " that this Government may determine " its future policy in relation to the " authorities concerned . " Since we have very tenuous relations with the Greek Government , and none at all ( officially ) with the Turks at Angora , the meaning of this is rather obscure . Without impugning any one 's good faith , it may be predicted that British members of the commission will find against the Turks , and French and Italian members against the Greeks . When the Angora Government accepted the proposal ? of an investigation it attached a number of conditions . One was that the Greeks , too , should be investigated , which is proper enough . Another was that members of the commission " should  --  be impar " tial , and enjoy the confidence of the " Angora Government . " This betrays a somewhat curious notion of impartiality . Another condition was that , besides , English , French and Italian representatives , the commission should also have Americans , Russians and Turks . The Turks , naturally , will vote for themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , for some reason , Angora seems convinced that the official representatives of America will favor the Turks , too . In view of the fact that news of these latest atrocities has been provided chiefly by Americans of the Near East Relief , this IS rather strange . Certainly the American representatives should be impartial , not only in fact but in reputation . It would be a capital mistake to appoint any one already known to be prejudiced against either Greeks or Turks . It is scarcely open to doubt that the Greeks have killed a great many Turks , in sporadic outbursts ' of ferocity ; and that the Turks have killed a great many more Greeks  --  probably five or ten times as many  --  Greeks and Armenians as well . And these Turkish killings have mostly been done ' in. cold blood and from a settled policy  --  the policy of making Anatolia ; a real " homeland of the Turkish race " by systematic , massacre of the Christian population . If these - shall be the findings of the commission , " . what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that mor91 condemnation : by a few ' investi- , gaIorsL  --  particularly if it is offset by a minority- report  --  will make the Turks . behave ? If . the Greeks should ' be ' found . at Ca n't , the great Powers possess means of coercion . But public opinion would hardly . tolerate pressure . on the Greeks for the-killing of , say , 25,000 Moslems , when the Turks had butchered hundreds of thousands of Christians . On the other hand , what can be done with MUSTAPHA KEMAL ? As our Pails correspondent observed yesterday , Angora is out of gunshot of the high seas . - Our investigations will be futile , ? will be only one more confession of the bankruptcy of the NearEastern/poli-cies of Western Europe and America , unless something can be done to stop the slaughter . That implies a settlement of the whole Near Eastern question . England , France and Italy have made half a dozen efforts to settle it , and have failed because their own selfish interests were in conflict . Can we contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
