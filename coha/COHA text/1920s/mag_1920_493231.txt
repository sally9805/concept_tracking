' The Week CONGRESS seems chiefly concerned with taxa- , tion , immigration , and relief for the farmers . After January 6th it will consider a protective tariff I01icY ? In the meanwhile the usual miscellaneous bills are being put forward : bills for federal inestigation of unemployment , " blue laws , " anti- ? jam and narcotic bills . A great number of legis- at ? rs are putting forth bills with the general aim , stimulating business . Pressure by the farmers , In the cotton states as elsewhere , seems to make ? Ttle form of government aid , on the lines of the War r Finance corporation , fairly certain . Senator til ? ? t wants an embargo on wool ; Senator Mc-Cumber wants to restrict the importation of grain , grain products , live stock and certain foods . Most th these measures are more or less emergency ones : they are cures for evils that have already gone far . Another characteristic is how little they fit in with ij general planned scheme of reconstructive legis-cia , ? n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different groups whose power i In tl votes : the reformers , the business men , the I growers , the cotton growers , the wheat grow- . ers : snare congress 's quite atten ap tiont. aren and zeal for these special Lere sp THE Republican members of the Senate finance committee have announced that there will be no effort to revise taxes at this session . But ' many signs point to the nature of the remedies they have in mind for the next . Small annoying tax burdens will be lifted , and of course the Republicans hope and promise to relieve business of the excess profits tax . How the resultant deficit may be covered is a puzzle . One way is to reduce Army and Navy appropriations . The expense of both arms for the fiscal year 192o was 2,347 million . The estimate for the next year is about 935 million for the Army and 679 million for the Navy . Republican plans seem to be to lop off 200 million from each figure . Any decision on Navy appropriations should be influenced by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament no program of capital ship construction until an exhaustive analysis of the experience of the Navy in the late war has shown just what items in naval construction remain valuable . A substantial reduction of our Army and Navy estimates would also be an excellent answer to Viscount Ishii , when he told the League Assembly that japan could not reduce armaments so long as the United States continued to increase them . BEFORE the election , predictions were numerous that the expulsion of the Socialists would multiply their vote in New York State . And if nowhere else in the country was there so lurid a sample , there was repression enough to lead many of us to that expect a the protests of the discontented would swell the national Socialist total to somewhere near two million votes . In New York Debs polled over four times as many votes as Benson had in 1916 . The first half of the prediction came true . But not the second : for the other day Mr. Otto Branstetter , the National Socialist Secretary , reported that the total was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing states had been heard from . These figures mean that the Socialists , after four years , punctuated by war , deportations , attacks on free speech , and Palmer , have just about held their own . The inference is inevitable : Whatever third party may grow to a real strength in our politics , it will not be the Socialist party . There is something in this party , in its creed or its tactics , that does not appeal to average Americans , however oppressed or restless they may feel . IN a speech before a meeting in New York to which he was introduced as a " law and order " governor , Governor John J. Cornwell said he would preserve respect for the law in Mingo county if he " had to call out every able-bodied man in the state and ask for the entire United States Army . " This speech does not give West Virginia any real excuse for being unable to take care of itself . The governor describes the beginning of disorder as follows : " Some of the operators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they joined the union . Then the operators unwisely sent in private detectives to dispossess the men of the company houses , and trouble started . " Why was Governor Cornwell unable to prevent the use of these " private detectives " by the companies ? If their use leads to murder , what steps has he taken to have it prevented by law ? If Governor Cornwell can not himself maintain law and order , but must call on the United States for help , this help should be impartial and complete , and should include a federal investigation as well as federal troops . EARLIER in the week Governor Cornwell made another interesting statement . The Miners ' assertion that there was in Mingo County a private army of gunmen , was , he said , " without the semblance of truth .. since the tragedy at Matewan early in May , when a number of the employees of the Felts Detective Agency were killed , no employees of that or any other concern . . . . have been in the strike region . . . . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but secret operatives . " This revelation by a public official of the use of spies in an American industry will not be forgotten . AN offensive and defensive alliance has been formed by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers , the International Ladies Garment Workers , and other smaller unions , to present a common solid front , 380,00o strong , to what seems to them the employers ' fight for a return to the sweat-shop . This Needle Workers Alliance is something new , but it would be less strange and surprising did not one of the allies ( the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ) belong to the American Federation of Labor . For its partner , the Amalgamated , is independent , and looked upon by the A. F. of L. with hostility , as it began life by seceding from the United Garment Workers , an A. F. of L. union . Since then , the Garment Workers have been used by the employers in attempts to break up the Amalgamated , and needless to say , they have not joined hands with the Amalgamated in this alli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ers have joined them , and they are in the A. F. of L. This is hard to explain , considering how lit ' tle love is lost between the great father of labor unions and a prodigal son . The cause is to he found not so much in the necessity for a " union sacree " against the employers , as in an essential solidarity and likeness among the needle workers . Desperate need there may be , but the alliance means more than that . The aggressive " open shop , will , we venture to say , shift the balance of forces within the ranks of organized labor . IT is likely that an investigation of the building trades , which has been disentangling the maze of corruption in New York , will be made in other cities as well . The Senate Committee on Recciti ? struction have the power to make such an investiga ' tion , but have had no counsel to assist them . Sella ' for Calder has introduced into the Senate a resolui ; tion authorizing his committee to employ sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other large cities are just as rotten as New Yt'rk ' and that a thorough investigation would hring light building rings in Chicago and Cleveland , an at least a Sam Parks or two , if not even a gra king of the caliber of Brindell . It is to be hope ? that the American Federation of Labor will sill more interest than it has in the case of New York Labor has everything to gain by exposing these crooks ; Mr. Gompers and the A. F. of L. haire t nothing to lose by a flatfooted condemnation ( ) Brindell and his like . But so far they have hee0 inactive and almost silent , and their silence and inactivity remain an unpleasant mystery . UNTIL the possibility of war with Japan e , 13 ' tirely disappears , the United States will go on Plaj ; ing with Japan a careful but tenacious gar " t ) t chess for strategic points in the Pacific . The lated move is Japan 's , and it centres about an islailf named Yap . This is almost the most western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' able naval station of Guam and the Philippines . A cable ' : station at Yap links Shanghai with the main cad from San Francisco to the Dutch East Indies , a. , also links the cable route from Guam to Manila o The position of our government , as described ' Mr. Norman H. Davis , Under-secretary of State , to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , is that Yap was not included in the Versailles disposition of the German Pacific Islands between Japan , Australia and New Zealand , and that , as an MIPortant cable station , it should not be controlled by any one nation . Japan has refused to enter into a cable convention with us unless we recognize her special rights in the former German cable system , includIng the station at Yap . Between these two Positions the International Communications Conference at Washington is deadlocked . MR . Lloyd George and his government have determined upon what he calls a " double policy " in Ireland . One side of it is martial law , and an in-tenser campaign against the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to make it impossible to bring about peace . " The other half is Great Britain 's readiness " to open ? . . . every channel for an honorable settlement . " Mr. Lloyd George has in his makeup much Mercury that responds to whatever political ternPerature happens to surround him , yet this time he Seems deeply , sincerely desirous of peace . But his method is impossible . Why does he think it possible ? This is best explained by his newspaper echo , the Daily Chronicle , in whose columns his toliey looks like an attempt to drive a wedge Divide ? et the camps of murder and peace in Ireland . Divide ? et impera . When Lloyd George says that the first necessary preliminary for the establishMent of normal conditions is that murder , crimes and violence should cease , " does he mean to include o ' violence , crimes and murders of the Black and Tans ? At this distance it seems as if there were ittle chance of dividing an Ireland that almost as " e man hates him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops are withdrawn . I. R ECENT public statement by the American Jewis. h Committee and some half-dozen other Jew- organizations attacks the Anti-Semitic proparncla that has been creeping through Europe and of finally reached us . The most recent example f this , the so-called " Protocols of the Meetings of the Zionist Men of Wisdom , " which are sup- , elsecllY a revelation of a world wide Jewish or-anization 's plan to overthrow Christian chili-otion by proletarian revolutions and erect a Jewish state on the ruins , has a long pedigree of the geries behind it . The theory that the Jews are c , Hidden Hand " behind all world troubles is three ' centuries old . During the Thirty Years ' War , Pamphlets were published attacking the Reforination as a plot against Christianity by the " Quacker , Frey-geister und Heil- und Gottlosen Juden . " This theory reappeared in blood curdling works from 1797 to 1868 . In 1868 a German named Hermann Goedsche , who had been dismissed from the Prussian Postal Service for forgery , fabricated a document that appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press to subvert Monarchy and Christianity . The present version of the " Protocols " is an amplified imitation of Goedsche 's handiwork adapted to the circumstances of the Russian Revolution of 1905 . It is by one Serge Nilus , whose mysterious description of how he came by the " secret documents " could scarcely deceive anybody . His work was skilfully used by the Russian secret police in pogrom propaganda . It has now been made over for Anglo-Saxon consumption in the form of a book The Cause of the World Unrest , published in New York by Putnams ; in a small pamphlet called The Protocols , published by Small Maynard &; Co. , of Boston , and also in recent articles in Mr. Henry Ford 's Dearborn Independent . As usual with such stuff , these are all anonymous , and could deceive only the most credulous , but since such people are in a majority in the world , a warning is all the more necessary . AN armistice ? some reports even call it a peace ? was signed by the Turks and Armenians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet know only in part ? seem to restrict Armenia to a very small area about Erivan and Lake Gokcha . The generous boundaries President Wilson wants for Armenia are understood to include territory five or six times as large as this . A solution on ethnographic lines would be somewhere between the extremes of the President and of the Turks , but massacres and migration would make such lines very difficult to determine . Under the Turkish terms , Armenia has cruelly shrunk . There is also news that what remains of the Armenia government has set up Soviets . " Soviets " in that part of the world can mean but little , as the Bolshevik propaganda in the East is nationalist far more than communist . It is perhaps for this reason that the Russians have forced a peace that gives so much to the Turkish nationalists . THESE are scattering returns from all parts of the world : Premier Giolitti has found it impossible to recognize the Regency of Quarnero if d'Annunzio insists on interpreting recognition as annexation of Fiume by Italy . A relief shipment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the United States for distribution in White Russia . This work is being organized by the All-Russian Jewish Public Committee of New York . There is a rumor that French textile manufacturers with unsalable surpluses on their hands are planning to sell them to Soviet Russia . The Greek government has officially invited King Constantine to return to his throne . Japan , says Baron Hayashi , one of her delegates at Geneva , " is perfectly prepared to give back KiaoChau as soon as possible . We have already asked China to enter negotiations , but China is hesitating . " Mexico has been officially recognized by Japan and Brazil . Mr. Woldemar , the Lithuanian delegate at Geneva , served notice on the League Council that his country is opposed to intervention ( for the plebiscite ) on Lithuanian soil , as it would be an infringement of the treaty with Russia .
