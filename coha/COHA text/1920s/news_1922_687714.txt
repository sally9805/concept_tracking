txt Although the Senate has its nose to the grindstone in an effort to effect the enactment of tariff legislation before the November elections , there is grave danger , in the opinion of some of the most astute politicians on Capitol Hill . that the Fordney-McCumber bill can not be passed unless Congress remains in continuous session through the Summer . Senator McCumber , Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , has declared in debate that : t the present rate of progress the bill would not pass until 1946 , but it is the expectation of Republican leaders that , with the holding of day and night sessions on it , great progress can be made , and they are hopeful of putting the bill through in some form before the end of August . Democratic Sent.tors deny the statement of the majority that a filibuster is being conducted . Senator Underwood asserts that the prompt passage of the bill , in its present form , would be greatly to the benefit of the Democratic party in the coming election , but highly detrimental to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the latter ground , he and his associates on the minority side are insisting that the various items , atnd especially the Senate amendments , should receive the closest consideration by the Senate , and that it is the duty of the minority to do its level best to prevent many of . the proposed rates from being enacted . Senators Impatient to Get Away . The slow progress of the bill , along with the generally discouraging legislative prospect ahead , is greatly worryin ? many members of the Senate because of the interference of the tariff with Senatorial primary campaigns for renomination and the effect it may have on the Senatorial elections in November .. Thirty-four members of the Senate will come up for election in the The legislative situation is holding Senators here who want to go to their home States - to mend their fences , and the tariff is the cause . Republicans generally feel that if tariff legislation is not enacted before November it will go hard with their party at the polls . What Republican leaders are fearing is that no adjournment can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff until next Winter . The Fordney bill as amended by the Finance Committee was reported to the Senate on April 10 . It contains 43S pages . Although thirty-four days have elapsed since the measure was reported to the Senate , that body has only found Itself able so far to deal with twenty pages . Night Sessions Fail to Hein . Since Tuesday of last week the Senate has been holding day arid night sessions , meeting at 11 o'clock in the morning and adjourning at 10:30 o'clock at night . The introduction of night sessions in an . effort to accelerate action on the schedules has not resulted in any appreciable progress . Much time has been taken from the tariff by speeches on matters foreign to the bill , and each Finance Committee amendment has been taking a large amount of time . There are 1,6:10 paragraphs in the bill dealing with the free and dutiable lists , in addition to 195 pages of text which contain no rates but relate only to tariff administration . During the thirty-four days that have passed since the bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , the Senate having reached the rate on licorice up to the hour of its adjournment yesterday . These forty-five paragraphs have not till been disposed of by the Senate , as come of them of a controversial character have been passed over for later consideration . The chemical schedule , tie first in the NIL is still under consideration . It contains eighty-eight paragraphs , so that the Senate is about half way through with it . The Finance Committee added 2,057 amendments to the Fordney bill end about 2,000 of these are yet to be considered on the . floor of the Senate . At the present rate of progress , if maintained , it would require about 200 more days for tae Senate to move through the schedules to " ' Lefler , " the last item on the free list .

It was argued in debate that there was no necessity for the higher rate of duty proposed on ink . tae statement Laving been made that practically no printer 's ink was Imported last year . On the contrary , it was asserted , this country exported printer 's ink . Senator Walsh told the Senate that a , heut ( 100,12100 worth of printer 's ink was used in this .. country last year , practically all of it of home manufacture , and that the proposed rate of duty would merely have the effect of raising the price . Other schedules are being similarly attacked anti this is responsible for the slow progress . the bin is making before the Senate . ** the tariff is the main business before that body , it does not have the exclusive right of way .

President Harding , Secretary Weeks , Generals Pershing and Harbord , and the rank and file of the army are counting upon the Senate to save the day for the army by inSieting.on a minimum of 150 , , 000 enlisted . men for the regular force , whose personnel of officers and men la proposed to be radically cut by the bin passed by the House last week . There will be a vigorous contest over both the Army and Navy Appropriations in the Senate . Each may take a week out of the time allotted for the tariff . The Senate has yet to agree to the conference reports on four other important appropriation bills . These are the Post Office , District of Columbia , Departments of Commerce and Labor , and Departments of State and Justice bills .

On the whole , the prospect is not a bright one for the thirty-four Senators chafing at the bit to go home for primaries-and fence-mending .
