txt Mr. SAMUEL . WILSON , Assistant Superintendent of the New Jersey AntiSaloon League , stands with distended nostrils , viewing the dry and not so dry landscape o'er , and is happy in the thought that , according tp the figures of National Prohibition Commissioner " the people of the " United States , under the Volstead " act , have drunk .006 pint of spirits " each day . This fraction is too small " to measure , so let us say it amounts " practically to one smell per capita " each day . " In New Jersey , however , the district with which he is most familiar , the average aroma is stronger . Jersey has " more than its share " of that which profiteth not . A little while ago we heard of the ravages of rum in the South . Now this , now some other city , is reported deplorably moist . The golden or arid age is always somewhere else . Mr. WILSON assures us that " the " consumption of beer and wine is " now fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable flow of . *hat is called beer in these parts yet ; and if wine is hard to get , the home manufacture of it , as of its stronger and weaker congeners. goes on busily and merrily .. One hears otherwise law-abiding citizens enthusiastically Comparing their " reCdpte " end the beverages produced in accordance with them . Home-made beer , ale , wine , not to mention direr drinks , are extolled as excellent , filling , cheap . Our friends of the Home Market Club must be much encouraged by this extraordinary development of home Manufactures . Those large , fat raisins that used to give alfriest ? a wine-sauce flavor re now hard to come by . They are understood to be devoted to the new household industries . Cider and fruit juices of an alcoholic content forbidden in public beverages are made , doubtless , " in millions of homes . " Linchpin of Our institutions , the farmer must have his cider if be wants it ; and there are these who want it and get it , as the Yankees used to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Few varieties of biting adders and stinging serpents equal good , conscientious hard cider in deadliness . A half of 1 per cent . is prescribed . for outdoor spirituous industries . The percentage in domestic ones is left to the discretion and taste for experiment of the producer and consumer . In the absence of a constitutional amendment prohibiting fermentation , the authorities will not attempt to check it ; but they gravely distinguish between natural and artificial fermentation . You must n't assist nature with sugar or any other means . Exactly how the gifted Federal nose is to poke itself into the multitudes of home industries and nab the delinquent who presumes to assist nature , we are not told . Home manufacturers will continue to stay themselves with apples and comfort themselves with flagons . The Government is relieved from the burden of collecting taxes on the damnable traffic . Home industries flourish ; still strong waters run deep ; and considerable regions are lighted , not to say " lighted up , " by moonshine . It was not to be expected that prohibition would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slow time . If there were not hosts of the wicked the Anti-Saloon League would have to go out of business , and that would be a calamity to divers earnest persons now making a good living .
