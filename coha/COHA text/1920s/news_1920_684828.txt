txt BOLSHEVISM IN BULGARIA . Minister Says Red Doctrines Have Little ' Chance There . To the Editor of The : Veto York Times : A dispatch dated Dec. 19 from Saloniki , and published in THE Toms a Dec. 21 , reports that the " Bulgarian Bolsheviki have been successful In municipal elections in Sofia . " and that the " newspapers In that city have appealed to the Bulgarian Government to take proper measures to maintain order and to prevent pillage which may result . " The dispatch also says that " a virtual panic prevails in Sofia , " that " production has decreased and a famine is said to be impending . " Considering that elections in Bulgaria are made according to the proportional system of- representation , it is highly improbable that any one party could have gained for itself the municipal elections in Sofia . It is not unlikely that the so-called " straight " or extreme Socialists may have won some seats on the Town Council . That such an occurrence should give rise to a panic or fear oft disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Assembly last August the extreme Socialists succeeded In securing 47 seats out of a total of 234 elected Deputies . The country was neither disturbed nor panic-stricken by this result . It has allowed these Socialists to enter the National Assembly , and they have proved to be less harmful in it than out of It . The assertion that production has decreased and a famine is impending is absolutely false . According to all advices from Bulgaria , trade and industry are gradually improving , and this year 's harvest has been excellent , more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the country . Bolshevism is not likely to find a fertile soil in Bulgaria , where 82 per cont. of the population are level-headed , conservatively inclined farmers , every one of whom owns the land he cultivates and is sole master of his possessions . There is still less chance for Bolshevism under the present Administration , in which the Farmers ' Party is virtually the controlling element , and its leader , Stambolisky , is the Prime Minister or Bulgaria .
