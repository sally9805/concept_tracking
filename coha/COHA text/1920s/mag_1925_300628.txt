In The Nation , is told the story of a South African Negro girl who left her employment suddenly and departed to her kraal ( hut ) . Her employer , a farmer , drove to the kraal , took the girl back to his farm and there flogged her . But this was not enough . He tied her up by the neck to a beam in a rat-infested barn . An hour later , the girl was found dead : the tips of her fingers had been gnawed off by the rats . <P> This abominable crime shook the whole Union of South Africa . The farmer was charged with homicide , tried , sentenced to only six months ' imprisonment . The moral deduced was that there are two kinds of justice in the Union , one for the white man , one for the black man . Incensed were the Negroes . <P> At Cape Town , a Negro mass meeting of protest was held . The Chairman said : " We have not got any trust in the white man along either political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-European lies in himself . " <P> But the anger of a part of the white population and the heated indignation of the Negroes meant nothing to the Anglo-Dutch Minister of Justice , one Tielman Roos . Interviewed by a correspondent of the Manchester Guardian , he stated his position " with appalling clarity " : " Impartial justice does not mean , . that a judge or a magistrate would necessarily give precisely the same sentence to a white man as to a native in a given crime . A very brief sentence of imprisonment to a white man means a great deal more to him than a very much longer term of detention to a native . "
