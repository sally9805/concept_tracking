Diagonally across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania last fortnight went an insult to Philadelphia . From Erie , at the farthermost corner of the state , came the announcement that the United Lutheran Church of America would not convene in Philadelphia at the next biennial assemblage ( 1930 ) . The reason for the snubbing of Philadelphia was the " graft scandals " of recent development . Milwaukee , free of graft scandals , was chosen instead . <P> <P> The Lutherans learned to their dismay that although $50,000 has been spent in Africa in two years of mission work , only one convert has espoused the faith . They learned , too , that in 68 years of carrying the light of faith in the dark continent , not one native congregation has been formed . Disheartening though this information was , the convention voted to continue its activities . <P> For the sixth time the Rev. Dr. Frederick Hermann Knubel was elected president of the United Lutheran Church in America . He has held the office since he was first elected ten years ago . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 58 years old .
