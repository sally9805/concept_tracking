txt TRAVESTY OF ARTICLE X. A Sample of What Goal Out Under a Senatorial Frank . I have lately received under the frank of Senator France of Maryland extracts from the Congressional Record evidently sent.out for propaganda purposes against the League of Nations . The two pamphlets are made beautiful by an elttravaganee of paper and typo more than reckless in these loan days , but the thing to which especial attention ought to be called is the argument of Mr. F. E. Rip , read into the Record by Senator France . It is the most astonishing specimen I have yet discovered in the extraordinary campaign of misrepresentation and misstatement to which the Covenant of the League has been so generally subjected by Its opponents . For this reason It ought to be rescued from oblivion as showing how far it is possible to go In this direction under the kind of hysterical frenzy which the Covenant seems to excite in some minds . For it Is most charitable supposition to consider that such distortions are honestly made and that the declaimer really thinks he has stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says : " Article X. of the League of Nations Covenant , calling upon the ' United States to guarantee , for all time , the present territorial integrity of every nation all over the world , is atrocious in the extreme . " It certainly would be atrociouS'in the extreme if it called for the guarantee stated . One of the most abominable results of the Senate campaign of vilification of the Covenant , regarding which no language can be too strong , is the . creation of the belief in ? the minds of thousands of originally well  --  disposed people , who have had no time to study the Covenant for themselves , that this travesty of Article X. is what it really means . One does not have to go far to find such misconception among his friends . Yet any one who has read the Covenant with an open mind knows , nut merely that Article X. asks for no such guarantee , but that , if It did , It would be wholly out of harmony with the spirit and purpose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that is possible , by two facts : First , that the primary purpose of Article X. ( deliberately concealed . by the omission- of the essential clause ? ) is plainly nut to guarantee anything . but to do away with tita moat frequent cause of war in the past . Warn of expansion and of conquest ; a 113 second , that the obligation is merely to extend to : the members of the League the protection against aggressive attack Which for a hundred years the United States has afforded to the Latin American States in the Monroe . Doctrine . Mr. Rip exposes to our abhorrence the origin of this atrocious article in the desire of Lloyd George and General Smuts to secure " the great power of the United States to back up England 's present territorial integrity in all corners of ' the earth- and for all time ! " He develops , also at great length what is , so far as I know , a discovery of his own , and an interesting one , that " the death knell of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our form of government made by the Versailles Treaty . I am sorry that I can not explain here this awful change , but I do not understand what it is . GEORGE BURTON ADAMS . New Haven , March . 27 , 1920.
