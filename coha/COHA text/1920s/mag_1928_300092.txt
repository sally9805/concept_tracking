That is one of the delusions men have which they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many men vote as do their wives . . . . It would not matter now if the Labor Party won at the British general election , because labor has stopped killing capitalists in England and has acquired a good deal of common sense in dealing with affairs . . . . " <P> Fritz Kreisler and Ina Claire also came in on the Aquitania-he with pleasant words for Composers Gershwin and Youmans ; she with the sentence , " I do n't mind who does the singing and dancing , so long as the author gives me plenty of funny lines .
