The equivalent of two million dollars gold was subscribed to a " vengeance fund , " last week at Tientsin , by enraged surviving relatives of great Yuan Shih-kai ( 1859-1916 ) . He was the last of the Manchu Viceroys , and became in 1912 the second President of the Chinese Republic . Last week his sons were made irate by reports that Yuan 's mighty tomb in Honan , his native province , has recently been looted and denied by the itinerant so-called Christian War Lord , Feng Yu-hsiang , who has now made Honan his base ( TIME , Jan. 23 ) . <P> Outstanding among contributors to the ' ' vengeance fund , " last week , was Yuan 's onetime sixth and favorite concubine , now a very aged lady of august consequence and immense wealth . With her approval , Yuan Shih-kai 's eldest son , Yuan Keh-cheng , took charge of the $2,000,000 fund and announced that he would at once raise and equip two brigades of troops to fight against Feng Yu-hsiang , despoiler of tombs . <P> The troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war which flames up each year between North and South China . At present Feng Yu-hsiang is fighting on the side of the Southern Nanking Nationalist Government and against the Northern armies of Marshal Chang Tso-lin , famed semi-imperial Dictator . Thus it will be under the banner of Dictator Chang Tso-lin that the vengeance brigades of Yuan Shih-kai 's relatives will fight . <P> Chinese who can not but deplore the present political disintegration of their country , wished last week that great Yuan Shih-kai might rise as a towering cohesive force from his open tomb in Honan . So great and national was his prestige that during the last year of his life and of his Presidency ( 1916 ) a movement to proclaim him Emperor and seat him on the Dragon Throne failed by the narrowest of margins . When the Chinese Revolution broke , in 1911 , Yuan Shih-kai , then Viceroy of Hunan and Hupeh , declared with prophetic vision : " Chaos will ensue . . . . For several decades there will be no peace in China . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
