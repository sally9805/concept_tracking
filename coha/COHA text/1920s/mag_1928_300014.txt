Lifting up his voice in Newark , N.J. , Nominee Hoover addressed himself to Labor , including " the woman who stays at home as the guardian of the welfare of the family . She is a partner on the job and the wages . " <P> He said : " Behind every job is a vast , intricate and delicately adjusted system of interlocked industries dependent upon skilled leadership . " <P> He said : " The modern relationships of government and industry are a tangled mass of economic and social problems . They are neither abstract propositions nor statistics . They are very human things . They can make for the happiness of every home in our country . " <P> He harked back to 1921 when " anxiety for daily bread haunted nearly one quarter of our 23 million families . " <P> He recalled how the Republican administration called a conference of which he was chairman ; how " within a year we restored . . . five million workers to employment " and produced stability , prosperity . . . . This recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been achieved by luck . " <P> Present depression in the coal and textile industries were touched on lightly , explained briefly . Then came a table of statistics showing how many more pounds of " that useful mixture , " bread and butter , the U.S. wage-earner can buy with his wages than any other wage-earner in the world . <P> Nominee Hoover said : " The Republican administration makes no claim to credit which belongs to the enterprise , energy and character of a great people . " <P> Protective tariff , restricted immigration , the Commerce Department 's service to exporters , its fostering of industrial efficiency were next mentioned . Specifically cited was the reduction " by nearly one-half " of the seasonal idling period in the building trades . <P> The Hoover promise for a billion-dollar Federal works program " to take up the slack of occasional unemployment " was repeated . <P> There was also repetition of the Hoover doctrine that efficiency in industry is " the road to the abolition of poverty . " <P> The use of injunctions in labor disputes got two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Nominee . <P> Conclusion : <P> " He would be a rash man who would state that we are finally entering the industrial millennium , but there is a great ray of hope that America is finding herself on the road to a solution of the greatest of all her problems . That problem is to adjust our economic system to our racial ideals . <P> " At such a time as this a change in national policies involves not-as some may lightly think-only a choice between different roads by either of which we may go forward , but a question also as to whether we may not be taking the wrong road and moving backward . The measure of our national prosperity , of our stability , of our hope of further progress at this time is the measure of what we may risk through a change in present policies . More than once in our national history a change in policies in a time of advancement has been quickly followed by a turn toward disaster . . . . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
