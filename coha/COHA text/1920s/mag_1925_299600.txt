The good ship Teno churned its way through many a mile of water until it finally glided silently alongside a dock that was in Manhattan . <P> Down the gangplank walked Simon Y. Patino , Bolivian Minister to Spain , a man worth ten times ten million good U. S. dollars . This short , broad man with a pug-dog face was accompanied by two sons , Rene and Onlino , two secretaries , two valets , one manager , one physician and 50 pieces of luggage . To the immigration men he handed a diplomatic passport . <P> From the docks , he drove straightway to a large hotel . At this point , enthusiastic journalists , bereft of all reason , had multiplied his fortune , exaggerated his power , invented many things . They could not decide whether the mining magnate of South America had taken seven or nine rooms at his hotel , half a floor or a whole floor- at any rate he stayed at a hotel . <P> It was definitely known that Bolivia 's richest man was in the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody knew ; though it was darkly hinted that the mission was concerned with the organization of a $50,000,000 corporation " which is to administer part of his property in Brazil . " <P> Simon Patino started life 59 years ago . Aged 28 ( when he was an insignificant storekeeper ) , he raised the enormous fortune of $18,000 to buy a tin mine . Since then , he has become richer and richer and still richer . He dislikes discomfort , and-as he has money with which to buy comfort-he keeps no fewer than 13 chteaux in various parts of the world-Nice , Biarritz , London , Paris , et cetera.
