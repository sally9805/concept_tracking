txt // complex function . It contains at least three distinct ferments , one changing the proteins , another the starch , and the third the fats . As the material passes along the intestines , it comes in contact with a juice secreted by the walls of the intestines which acts on the starch , but there is little action on the proteins and fats . From the time the food enters the stomach , during its entire course along the digestive tract , in some way not wholly understood , the digested food has been absorbed and received into vessels , through which it is distributed to the various parts of the body . A part of the food materials , however , in passing through the digestive tract escapes digestion . The amount of food digested // depends on the kind of food , the amount fed , the class of animal , and the condition of the animal 's health . Size of digestive organs . ? The length and capacity of the digestive organs of the various farm animals differ widely . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food the cow , sheep , and goat ? the stomach is a very complicated organ . It has four divisions , or sacs , called paunch , honeycomb , manyplies , and rennet . The paunch is very large and may be considered as a reservoir for the storage of bulky foods . Because of this provision , ruminating animals may be fed on foods containing much more bulk than the pig or horse . The food during its retention in the paunch becomes thoroughly soft ened and undergoes some fermentation , then it is rechewed called chewing the cud and swallowed . Stomachs of horses and pigs are single sacs which have not nearly so great capacity . The varying length of intestines and capacity of stomach in farm animals is illustrated in the following table : 1 . Digestible nutrients are those parts of food materials that are digested and appropriated to the animal 's use . Knowledge of the amount of the food materials that are digested is based on experimental data and , while not absolutely accurate , is sufficiently so for practical purposes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The animal is fed for a sufficient // length of time on a certain food , or combination of foods , so that the digestive organs contain only the food under test . Then for a certain length of time the animal is fed a carefully weighed allowance of some food , the composition of which has been previously determined by a chemist . Provision is then made for collecting all excreta . By making an analysis of this waste matter , the undigested protein , carbohydrates , and fat are found . This , deducted from the total in the food , gives the digested part . The amount of each constituent digested divided by the total in the food gives the percentage digestible . This is called the " coefficient of digestibility . " The composition of the food as determined by the chemist and the digestible coefficient as determined with the animal being known , it is easy to calculate the amount of digestible nutrients in the various foodstuffs . It is with the digestible nutrients and not the total food materials that the feeder is concerned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various experiment stations to determine the digestibility of foodstuffs . For ready reference Table LXIV , showing the amount of digestible nutrients in a large number of foods , is given in the Appendix . 147 . Total digestible nutrients consist of the digestible crude protein and carbohydrates and the digestible fat multiplied by 24 . The fat contains more energy than the other constituents and hence must be multiplied by 2+ so that it may compare with the other constituents in energy . The total digestible nutrients give a measure of the usefulness of a food and , to facilitate the computations , they are included in Table LXIV and are used in the formulation of rations . 148 . Digestibility of food materials . ? Among the various food materials the carbohydrates , as a rule , are the most digestible , running as high as 95 per cent in case of corn , while the crude fiber is the least digestible , and between these lie fat and protein . In general the fat is more digestible than the protein . As a rule the digestible coefficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumption of food is forced , the animal does not // digest it so thoroughly as if fed smaller amounts . On the other hand greater digestibility can not be secured by limiting the consumption . Animals under a starving ration do not digest any more than when fed a normal amount . The grains are more highly digestible than the coarse fodders ; for example , in corn the protein is 76 per cent digestible , the crude fiber 58 , the nitrogen-free extract 93 , and the fat 86 per cent digestible , while in timothy hay the protein is 56 per cent , the crude fiber 58 , the nitrogen-free extract 63 , and the fat 57 per cent digestible . 149 . Concentrates , roughage , and succulence . ? These terms are used to differentiate feeds that are condensed and nutritious , those that are coarse and bulky , and those that contain a high per84 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY tentage of water . Concentrates refer to the various grains and seeds , especially corn , oats , and wheat , and milling by-products , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roughage refers to the various hays , such as timothy , clover , corn fodder , and straw , and sometimes to such watery foods as silage , roots , cabbage , and the like although these are more properly called succulent foods . MAINTENANCE AND PRODUCTIVE RATIONS A ration may be defined as the quantity of food that is consumed in twenty-four hours by an animal weighing one thousand pounds . In forming rations it is necessary to take into account the purpose for which the animal is used . For convenience of study rations are divided into two general classes ? rations for maintenance and rations for production . 150 . Maintenance ration . ? A maintenance ration is one that supplies the needs of a resting animal , that is , an animal producing no kind of labor and suffering no loss or gain of body substance . It has already been seen that a certain amount of the food consumed by the animal goes to support life , maintain body temperature , repair waste tissue , and the like . Since the demands on the body for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , nine-tenths or more of the maintenance ration may consist of carbohydrates . 151 . Productive rations may be looked on as made up of two parts : that which is needed to maintain the animal and that which may be applied to production after the bodily needs have been supplied . It is the food consumed and digested in excess of the amount required for maintenance that enables the animal to produce . The question , then , is as to the quantity of food the animal will consume and make sufficient returns in production . While it is true in a sense that the amount of production is in proportion to the quantity of food assimilated in excess of that required for maintenance , it is only within rather narrow limits that this relation holds strictly true . The individuality of the // animal plays an important part . All farm animals will eat and digest more food than is required for maintenance , but the amount of product that comes from this excess of food is variable , and in many cases this makes the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards for farm animals . ? A feeding standard is a rule to which all rations should conform for a given purpose . The Germans have done much work in establishing such standards , which have long been in general use as guides in computing rations for farm animals . Thus the German chemist Wolff proposed that animals be fed daily certain amounts of digestible protein , carbohydrates , and fat , and this formula became known as the Wolff feeding standard . Later this standard was improved by Lehmann , after which it became known as the Wolff-Lehmann feeding standard . The German standards have been ' modified by American investigators who have sought to improve them and adapt them to American conditions . These standards are known as the modified Wolff-Lehmann feeding standards and are based on the weight together with the age and condition of the animals as well as the nature of the product or work done . They include the amount of dry matter , digestible crude protein , carbohydrates , and fat , together with total digestible nutrients and the nutritive ratio , for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of farm animals are included in the various chapters on feeding . Kuhn , Kellner , Armsby , and others , working with the energy value of food , have suggested feeding standards based on the amount of energy required to yield a given product although such are seldom used . 153 . Minerals . ? While not included in the standards , minerals are important constituents of the food as an inadequate supply results in lack of thrift , in poor health , emaciation , and disease . In the case of swine it is well known that close confinement and certain kinds of food result in loss of control of the hind quarters or in. some other crippled condition ; while pregnant animals receiving an inadequate supply of minerals produce weak , deficient , // and often dead offspring . This condition is probably due to an insufficient amount of calcium and phosphorus , both of which may be supplied by a legume hay , such as clover , alfalfa , or cowpea . When the food is deficient in minerals , it is imperative that they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone meal , bone flour , bone black , precipitated bone , or even ground rock phosphate although the latter is probably less soluble in the digestive tract than the other forms . The mineral content is included under Total Ash in Table LXIV of the Appendix . 154 . Vitamins . In addition to protein , carbohydrates , fat , and mineral matter , recent investigation has emphasized the importance of certain compounds called " vitamins , " the composition of which is not known . While these compounds have not been separated out and isolated , yet it is known that they are essential to normal development . Three different compounds have been reported : fat-soluble vitamin , water-soluble vitamin , and antiscorbutic vitamin . Fat-soluble vitamin ( A ) is abundant in leafy vegetables , germs of seeds , milk , butter , eggs , and cod-liver oil , but is lacking in body fat and vegetable oils , and generally deficient in cereals . The absence of this vitamin retards normal growth . Water-soluble vitamin ( B ) is abundant in fresh fruit , vegetable food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly milled flour , polished rice , bolted corn meal , and the like . The absence of this vitamin in human food results in a malady , beriberi , causing general weakness and even paralysis . Antiscorbutic vitamin ( C ) is abundant in fresh fruit , vegetables , and fresh milk but is low in cereals and is injured by cooking . The absence of this vitamin results in scurvy . These compounds play an important part in the nutrition of farm animals , especially young stock and those calling for rapid development , such as swine and poultry . To give an idea of the more important foods containing the various vitamins , such foods are designated in Table LXIV of the Appendix although the list is very incomplete . // BALANCED RATIONS A balanced ration is one that contains the food nutrients in the proper proportion to meet the needs of the animal for a given purpose . Skill in balancing a ration depends much on one 's knowledge of the composition and digestibility of the more common foods . 155 . Nutritive ratio . ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given food and the digestible carbohydrates and fats . It is ascertained in the following manner // Multiply the digestible fat by 24 , add the product to the digestible carbohydrates , and divide their sum by the digestible protein . The method of calculating the nutritive ratio of corn , the digest ible nutrients of which are protein 7.7 , carbohydrates 66.7 , and fat 4.6 , is as follows : This gives a nutritive ratio of 1 : 10.0 for corn , and it means that for each pound of digestible protein in the corn there are 10 pounds of digestible carbohydrate and fat equivalent . A nutritive ratio may be distinguished as " narrow " or " wide . " A ration with a narrow ratio is one in which the proportion of protein is quite large , say 1 : 4.5 , whereas a ration with a wide ratio is one where the carbohydrates are large , say 1 : 8 or 1 : 10 . These terms do not represent exact values , but are used in a general way . 156 . Computing rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sometimes calls for patient effort as many trial calculations may be necessary . To illustrate the method , the case of a 1000-pound horse at heavy work may be taken . Use standard and table of composition of foods .  --  To begin , the standard ration which is stated on page 93 should be used . It consists of 20 to 26 pounds of dry matter , 1.4 to 2.2 pounds digestible crude protein , and 14 to 18 pounds of total digestible nutrients with a ratio of 6.5 to 8.5 . Then the composition of the foods to be used , which in this case are red-clover hay , corn , and oats , should be found . This information is given in Table LXIV of the Appendix . Since the standard for the horse at heavy work calls for 20 to 26 pounds of dry matter , as a trial ration 12 pounds of red-clover hay , 5 of corn , and 5 of oats may be taken . Compute composition of trial ration . ? To do this , the amount of dry matter , digestible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 12 pounds of clover hay should be computed as follows : This trial ration balances in protein , giving a satisfactory ration but shows a shortage in dry matter and total nutrients . ( 3 ) Improve trial ration . ? As there is sufficient protein , this trial ration may be improved by adding one more pound of oats , a food of which the horse is very fond . This ration balances very well and should give satisfactory results although for severe work it would probably be necessary to increase the amount of food so as to approach the upper level of the standard . 157 . Short method for computing rations . Since feeding standards are but guides in the formulation of rations , it has been suggested that these standards be given some flexibility , allowing maximum and minimum figures for dry matter , digestible protein , and total nutrients . If the ration is properly balanced so that it compares favorably with the standard in these ingredients , it will bring the nutritive ratio approximately correct and form a good working basis . This simplifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed ration for the 1000-pound horse at heavy work would appear in opposite table . To become familiar with the relation between the protein and the other nutrients of the compute the carbohydrates and fat separately although the ratio may be obtained by subtracting the crude protein from the total nutrient before dividing . Neither the dry matter nor the total nutrients as such are used in computing the nutritive ratio . REVIEW AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 . How and where do plants obtain their nutrients ?

CHAPTER V FEEDING THE HORSE The feeding of the horse is to provide nutrients for maintenance and for the energy used in draft work , driving , riding , and the like . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kind of work as well as the size of the animal , it is important to have a standard or guide in making up the ration . 158 . Feeding standards for horses are based on the weight , together with the age and the work performed , and include the amount of dry matter , the digestible crude protein , the total digestible nutrients , and the nutritive ratio . // The standard indicates that a substantial increase in work should be accompanied by a marked increase in the digestible crude protein and the total digestible nutrients . The heavy-work horse requires twice the nutrients of one that is idle . 159 . Preparation of feed . ? Feed may be prepared in several ways , such as grinding , crushing , and chopping the grain ; cutting , chaffing , and shredding the dry forage ; and by cooking , soaking , and moistening . Feed thus prepared is more thoroughly and rapidly masticated for the reason that it is torn to pieces by mechanical means or rendered soft by soaking , thus reducing the labor of mastication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at light work need receive little attention as such animals have enough time and energy to use in mastication . The horse , however , at heavy work will be benefited by having his food prepared for him . The ration may be made more palatable by chaffing the hay , then mixing it with the crushed grain , and dampening the // whole with a light sprinkling of water . This method may be used to promote the consumption of roughage as the sprinkling flavors the hay and reduces the dust . A bran mash , made by wetting wheat bran with hot water so as to form a thick , fairly moist feed and fed once a week , is very beneficial to the horse . It has a loosening effect on the bowels and is cooling with a tendency to allay a feverish condition . Because of its laxative effect , it should be given the severe-work horse on Saturday evenings . Regularity in feeding . ? The importance of regularity in everything that pertains to the management of the horse can not be overestimated . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ration , the horse should be fed regularly and uniformly at all times . The horse anticipates the feeding hour and becomes nervous if it is delayed . He neighs and coaxes for his food with great regularity . The horse 's digestive system and his vital activities become accustomed to a certain order , which should be followed . To change the order for even a single meal produces more or less digestive disturbance . Order of supplying food . ? Because of the small size of the horse 's stomach , the order of supplying grain , hay , and water assumes much importance . Investigators have shown that the stomach of the horse must fill and empty itself two or three times for each meal given . During the fore part of the meal the material is pushed into the intestines almost as soon as it enters the stomach by the food which follows , while toward the end of the meal passage is slow and the digestion in the stomach more perfect . This being true , it would seem that the more nutritious foods should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since some of the important nutrients are largely digested in the stomach and at the entrance of the small intestine . Watering the horse . ? The horse should be watered frequently , the aim being to prevent thirst , which in turn will keep the animal from drinking to excess and will prevent digestive disorders . Therefore the horse should be watered four to six // times daily , preferably before and after each meal . The amount of water a horse will drink depends on the temperature , the work , and the feed . Legumes , such as clover and alfalfa hay , tend to increase the water consumption while the succulent foods , such as carrots and silage , tend to decrease the water consumption . Water is important in digestion as it aids in softening and dissolving the food and favors its movement through the digestive tract. 163 . Salt should be kept before the horse at all times . While little is known from investigations on this subject , it is evident from the extreme fondness of the horse for salt that it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much before him at a time as some horses will eat it to excess . FEEDING THE WORK HORSE The work horse has a very hearty appetite , a vigorous digestion , and responds , more readily than any other animal , to intelligent care . He should be fed liberally and frequently , the quantity given being regulated by the size of the animal as well as by the amount and kind of work he is required to do . 164 . Amount to feed . In general the horse should be supplied with something over two pounds of provender daily for each hundred pounds of weight . Of this about one-half , the exact quantity depending on the severity of the labor performed , should be grain ' in some form . If the work is exceedingly heavy , the grain in the ration should be increased , and the hay diminished ; whereas , if the work is light , the grain should be diminished , and the hay increased . The successful horseman will study each individual and modify the ration according to the varied needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular allowance , and the next possibly a little less , because some horses are more difficult to keep in condition than others doing the same work and living under similar conditions . 165 . Method of feeding . ? For the morning meal , one-third of the horse 's ration should be fed at least one hour before time to work . It should be in condition to be consumed easily and rapidly // so as to be well out of the way when the animal is led from the stable . After being watered , he is ready for the morning 's task . If the work is exhausting and exacting , he should be fed after five hours of labor . When he comes to the stable at midday , he should have a drink of fresh cool water , but he should not drink too rapidly or gorge himself if very warm . At this time he should be given another third of his daily allowance . No greater service can be rendered the horse at this time than to remove the harness so that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes of much needed rest . If possible , he should have one hour to consume // his meal . He should be watered again before going to work . When the horse comes to the stable in the evening , tired and warm , he should , first of all , be allowed a fresh cool drink of water . He is now ready for the remainder of his day 's allowance . He should be unharnessed at once and , when the sweat has dried , given a thorough brushing . If for some reason the horse is forced to stand idle in the stable for a few days , the ration should be decreased . Otherwise he will become stocky , and his legs become swollen and stiff . During cold weather a more carbonaceous ration may be used . When more food goes to furnish heat for the body , it is reasonable that a horse needs a large proportion of heat-making food . Equal parts of corn and oats by weight would be more satisfactory and ordinarily much cheaper than a larger proportion of oats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ration . ? In providing a ration , whether for summer or for winter use , due consideration should be given to the cost . Roughage is ordinarily much cheaper than grain , but a horse at work is unable economically to dispose of a large proportion of bulky food . If considerable time and energy must be expended in masticating rough feed , the usefulness of the horse for work is lessened thereby . The more concentrated the food , within . proper limits , the less percentage of energy will be needed to make it available and thus the more energy the horse will have for his work . In general the cost of horse labor may be reduced : by increasing the efficiency of the horse , by increasing the number of hours ' work a year , by raising colts , by disposing of the old horses at ten to twelve years of age while they may be sold to advantage , and by replacing them by young home-grown animals . 167 . Feeding mules . ? Mules should be fed similarly to horses . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse and will make use of coarse foods that the horse will not eat unless forced to do so by necessity . Mules are often preferred by large business concerns , not that they consume less food for a given amount of work than horses , but that their feeding can be trusted to less skillful hands without seriously endangering the mules ' // health . If an extra large mess is given the mule , he eats what he wishes and leaves the remainder ; not so with the tired horse , which will eat all the grain that is given him up to the point of seriously endangering his health . For best results the ration of the mule should consist of easily digested and nutritious feeds , which should be varied from time to time as no animal loves a variety better than the mule . The ration should be suited to the kind of work . In all essential features the mule is very similar to the horse. , and the suggestions for horses apply with equal force to mules . 168 . Feeding the brood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suggested for work horses with perhaps the addition of more protein foods , like bran and oil meal . The ration should be such as will supply the demands for energy and in addition allow abundant nourishment for the development of the foal both before and for a time after birth . A very good ration for the pregnant mare is as follows : four parts ground oats , four parts wheat bran , or its equivalent , and one part linseed meal , with bright clover or alfalfa hay for roughage. 169 . Wintering the idle horse .  --  It is more economical and perhaps advisable that the idle horse be given the freedom of a lot to be roughed through the winter rather than confined too closely in the barn , especially if he has access to a dry , well-protected shed . Under such conditions he gets the much needed exercise and grows a long coat of hair , which affords excellent protection . While the idle horse may subsist largely on forage , such as hay and corn fodder , grain , such as oats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a day . Moderate grain feeding and some work to put the animal in condition should begin a few weeks before regular spring work starts . 170 . Fattening the horse . ? A business has developed of purchasing Western horses , four to six years old , and shipping them to northern Ohio , where they are fattened for the Eastern markets . While the practice varies , the feeding period lasts about one hundred days . The horses are confined to the stable , and // their teeth are floated ; they then are put on feed slowly to avoid disease . On account of their small stomachs , they are often fed five or six times daily , one firm giving three feeds of oats and wheat bran and three feeds of corn , with clover hay available all the time . A large horse may eat eight to ten large ears of corn three times daily , three quarts of oats each morning and evening , with three pounds of bran at noon . Under such conditions the gains average about three pounds a day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential that the newborn foal get the first milk from the dam . This foremilk looks thick and yellow and is called colostrum . It is a natural purgative for the removal of the material that has accumulated in the foal 's digestive tract during the last few days of its development . Its prompt removal is essential to the life of the colt . 171 . Food for the young foal . ? It often happens that the milk of the mare is insufficient to promote healthy , vigorous growth in the foal , and occasionally it becomes necessary to raise a foal entirely independent of the dam . In such cases the best addition or substitute for the milk of the mare is that of the cow . The milk of the mare has more sugar and less fat than that of the cow . One should get milk from as fresh a cow as possible , and the poorer in fat the better , as mare 's milk will average only about 1.2 per cent fat while the milk of most cows runs above 3 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pint of cow 's milk should be added half a teacupful of limewater , in which has been dissolved a dessert-spoonful of white granulated sugar . It should be warmed to blood heat , and the foal fed not to exceed half a teacupful every hour at first . As the foal grows older , the amount may be increased , and the frequency of feeding decreased . 172 . Feeding grain . ? As soon as the foal is old enough , it should be encouraged to nibble at grain , preferably ground oats . It will begin to munch the grain and hay at three or four weeks // of age and should be encouraged to eat . It will eat only a very little at first . If it is necessary that the foal have milk after it is two months old , skimmed milk should be substituted for fresh cow 's milk . A colt should never be fed sour milk or milk from unclean vessels . Should there be any trouble from constipation , it will be well to add about one half pint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be fed with profit to growing colts , as it furnishes a large proportion of muscle-forming and bone-forming food . 173 . Weaning the foal . = This is more a question of preparation than of the absolute removal of the foal from the dam ; and the simplicity of the weaning process depends on the thoroughness // of the preparation . If the foal has been accustomed to grain as suggested , if it has been permitted to take increasingly more as it grew , then the process will not be difficult , for as the ration increases in amount of grain , it will decrease in the amount of milk consumed . When the time arrives for complete separation , there will be very little if any setback or disturbance to either foal or dam although one should take care that the mare 's udder does not cake . Foals are usually weaned at four to six months of age , depending on conditions . Care should also be taken that the new quarters , where the weanlings are confined , are so constructed and arranged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 174 . Feeding the colt . ? After weaning , the colt should be provided with a well-ventilated and well-lighted box stall in the winter and with the run of a well-watered and nutritious pasture in the summer ( Fig. 33 ) . In the winter he should be fed liberally . On the average a medium-sized weanling will consume 5 pounds of grain and 7 of hay ; a yearling 7 pounds of grain and 18 of hay ; and a two-year-old 9 pounds of grain and 20 of hay daily during a winter season of seven months . Large colts will eat more ; small ones , less . Ground oats , wheat bran , and hominy feed , mixed one third each by weight , to which has been added 10 per cent linseed oil meal , make a very good ration for the growing colt although whole oats should be fed once daily . Based on this food consumption , a colt up to three years of age will consume about 2 4 tons of grain and 44 tons of hay in addition to 15 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? A few rations are suggested to serve as a guide in determining the kind and amount of food that should be given the horse when idle , at light , at medium , and at heavy work . These rations meet the requirements of the feeding standards for the horse and have given satisfactory results for the conditions mentioned . They are based on 1000 pounds ' live weight . // REVIEW AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS Why is it that the work horse requires less protein than other pro-ducing animals .

CHAPTER VI GENETICS The economic production of farm animals involves a knowledge of the fundamentals underlying their propagation . The better knowledge one has of the individual , the source of its characteristics , the factors that influenced their origin and development , the more intelligently may he choose animals that may be relied on to promote advancement and general improvement .

While numerous factors probably enter into the improvement of farm animals , yet the experience of successful breeders has been such as to give abundance : 105 // of evidence to support the theory that environment , selection , and heredity ( Fig. 32 ) are the most important means by which farm animals have been improved . The environment controls development ; the development directs selection , while selection governs individual efficiency ; and individual efficiency directs the heritage , which gives the " blood , " signifying purity of strains , families , and breeds of farm animals . The individual is the result of the interaction of these three factors , since he may be modified by changing any one of them . 178 .

To promote advancement , the animal must he well fed at all times , but more especially while young , as the individual retarded at this age may never reach that degree of perfection which he otherwise would , had he been properly nourished during the days in which growth was possible . The shelter required for advancement necessarily varies with the several classes of animals and with the climate . Exposure to hot sun , as well as to cold rains and storms , is especially harmful as it retards development . The shelter should be sufficient to keep the animal in comfort . 179 . Developing and training are essential to greatest advancement . No matter how suitable the other conditions , indeed no matter how pure the heritage , greatest usefulness in many economic features of farm animals may not be attained without proper training and developing . This is imperative as it shows the capabilities and develops all of the potentialities with which the animal is endowed , which in the absence of proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of dairy cows and race horses , the only two classes of farm animals in which there are accurate records of performance . Here the possibilities of the individual are known with exactness , and this information the breeder uses in selecting his breeding animals , with the result that some very remarkable performances have been reported , especially in the case of dairy cows . // 180 . Heredity denotes the acquirement of the offspring from its ancestors and is commonly used to signify resemblance between parent and offspring . Thus there are such expressions as " like begets like " and the offspring resembles its parent because it is a " chip off the old block " although sometimes the similarity is noted between the offspring and grandparent or even more remote ancestor . This has led to a defining of heredity as organic resemblance based on descent . The idea signifies the transmission of the determiners of individuality from ancestors to offspring . 181 . Selection . ? Heredity does not distinguish between the desirable and the undesirable , and the offspring may obtain either or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part in advancement as the successful breeder selects for propagation those animals with desirable characters and eliminates those individuals that fail to come up to expectation . Not all animals are capable of suitable development , even under proper conditions , as some individuals make more rapid advancement than others ; and here again selections prove the key to improvement as all animals that fail to develop'up to the standard are disregarded and only those that come up to expectation are retained . Thus the average efficiency of the animals retained is superior to the average of those born . Since the degree of selection employed in practice is the controlling factor in the usefulness of living animals , it would seem well worth while to give careful consideration to the methods whereby selection may be used more effectively . 182 . Unit of selection : character . In the improvement of farm animals selection is based on some particular character , as capacity to secrete milk in the dairy cow , weight and quality in the draft horse , and fleshing in the case of meat animals . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those details of form or function which , taken together , constitute the individual animal . It is significant to note that certain characters are correlated , others opposite , and still others independent . Thus there is a high degree of correlation between a capacious udder and high milk production ; there is negative correlation between the // amount of milk produced and the percentage of fat that it contains , for , as milk production increases , the percentage of fat usually decreases ; and there is entire lack of correlation between the color of a cow and the amount of milk she gives since black cows give as much and no more rnilk than white cows . 183 . Basis of selection : variation . ? If characters were fixed and unchangeable , then no improvement could be secured . The richness of the milk , as well as the amount produced , could neither be increased nor diminished from generation to generation ; the ' egg-laying capacity of hens would remain constant as would the fleshing ability of meat animals , and the offspring would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , is the basis of improvement . It is obvious that a high degree of variation // is favorable to advancement as it gives free materials with which to use selection to advantage . Since variation is the controlling factor in improvement , as well as in the decline of farm animals , a careful study should be made of its frequency as well as of the kinds , nature , extent , and cause that determines its appearance and controls its permanency. 184 . Variation general in farm animals . ? Not only are no two animals exactly alike , but no two characters are equal and similar . To those unfamiliar with sheep , each animal of a flock may look exactly like the others , yet the trained eye readily recognizes differences and can describe each so that those with equal training may recognize them . Two cows of like breeding may differ widely in the richness of their milk as well as in the quantity produced ; two horses of similar breeding may vary in conformation , action , and pulling power ; two steers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat may also be unlike , the loin of one being tender and juicy while the other may be tough and dry . Sheep , swine , and poultry differ similarly . Indeed the most invariable thing about living things is their variability . 185 . Nature of variation . ? To get an idea of the nature of variation , it is necessary to consider the parent and offspring . It seems that some individuals transmit their good qualities to their offspring while others apparently do not . Further , some individuals transmit the ability to show still further improvement under suitable environment while others do not . Thus there appear to be two kinds of animals ? one class transmitting its qualities , both good and bad , and a second class that does not transmit them . These two classes of animals give the distinction between the two types of variation . Thus one kind of variation is passed down from generation to generation and called inheritable variation , and a second class is not thus passed along from ancestor to offspring and is known as noninheritable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used to denote all variations , whether large or small and of whatever origin , that are // transmitted from parent to offspring . It is obvious that such variation is of prime importance to the stockman as such is destined in time to exert a more or less permanent influence on his animals , whether for good or bad . At the time of their appearance it may not be possible to distinguish between the inheritable and the noninheritable variation . It was to keep a record of such that registers of performance were introduced . These records serve as guides in the selecting of animals known to transmit good qualities . The skilled breeder does not become confused by the endless number of variations , involving all shades of difference , that present themselves to his view as generations come and go . He considers them with full realization that few will have a permanent influence on his animals . He is skilled not only in detecting useful characters but also those that are connected with transmission since they are to mold the type . This calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate records of production and breeding capacity . 187 . Noninheritable variation . ? In the propagation of farm animals this class of variation is insignificant although it may be important from the standpoint of economic production alone , such as the case of cows in a commercial dairy when no attempt is made to raise the calves ; on poultry farms , when all eggs are sold for consumption ; and in the case of meat animals when all are slaughtered . Here the demand is for immediate consumption , and frequently some very phenomenal producers are reported . 188 . A cause of variation : environment . ? While the exact cause of variation is little understood , experience has taught that certain practices may be relied on to give good results with animals . The general causes of variation may be divided into two classes : those that arise within the animal in the form of inherited differences and those due to external conditions , chief of which is the environment . The breeder influences the former but little , if at all ; while over the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of environment are noted in the speed of the trotting horse and the increased yield of dairy cows . // In 1810 Boston trotted a mile at Philadelphia in 2 : 482i and this was not exceeded for sixteen years , while in 1922 Peter Manning trotted a mile at Lexington in 1 : 56* . The conditions under which these records were made are noteworthy . Boston was trained but a few months each year ; he was not worked out ; the memorable mile was driven to a high , wooden-wheeled , steel-tired , straightspindled clumsy cart ; the harness was heavy and not adapted to trotting ; and the track over which the record was made was not well constructed . Peter Manning was in training practically throughout the year ; he was perfectly worked out and in prime physical condition ; he was driven to a low , wire-wheeled , pneu-matic-tired , ball-bearing , perfectly balanced cart ; the harness was light and perfectly adapted ; and the track was one of the fastest in the world . In the early days of official cow testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered to be exceptional while the record now ( 1924 ) stands at 41.5441 pounds of butter fat in seven days , almost 100 per cent increase in twenty-eight years . Formerly // cows on test received no special preparation before calving or sub sequently ; the food consisted of a moderate amount of one or two kinds of concentrates , all the hay they would consume , and pasture in season ; the cows were seldom blanketed and were fed and milked twice daily . At the present time test cows are especially pre-pared and are often excessively fat ; they are closely stabled and often heavily blanketed ; they are fed all the food they will eat , often as high as 40 pounds or more of concentrates , consisting of a dozen foods variously mixed in addition to silage , roots , cabbage , and all the clover or alfalfa hay they will consume , the total daily ration often exceeding 100 pounds of food ; and the cows are fed and milked four times each day . 189 . Introducing new strains : crossing . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed . The constructive ; application of this method and the successful introduction of new blood calls for skill of the highest order . While crossing is the main re liance in certain types of breeding , yet very frequently more injury is done than can be repaired in generations , particularly if the new blood fails to nick with the established strain . Frequently this method is employed to obtain foundation stock , after which close selection and inbreeding is practiced to establish and fix the newly introduced character and to purify the strain . In pure-bred breeding this applies only to strains and families within the given breed . // 190 . Factors in selection . ? In the improvement of farm animals it is imperative to have a definite ideal for guidance in selecting breeding animals . This calls for a general knowledge of the history of the breeds , a familiarity with the fancy points , breed peculiarities , fashionable breeding , and the like . Finally in the selection of the individual a careful study should be made of individual merit , of the pedigree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prepotency. 191 . History of the breed . ? In the propagation of farm animals one must know the weak characters as well as the strong points of the breed with which he is working . The necessity for this is illustrated in the case of the Percheron draft horse ( Fig. 11 ) and in Berkshire swine . Many of the breeds of draft horses , especially those native to the British Isles , are rather heavy in bone . This has led the English draft-horse breeders to select for refinement in bone . Occasionally a Percheron draft-horse breeder selects his animals on the same basis , which results in too light a horse and lack of endurance in the limbs . This is explained by the fact that the light horse of Arabia played a very important part in the development of the Percheron breed , which , therefore , is predisposed to light bone . Likewise the Berkshire breed of swine resulted largely from crossing the small , refined , quick-maturing Neapolitan hog on the large English hog ; and many are the Berkshire herds that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refined , and quick-maturing pigs . 192 . Breed fancy points . ? Practically all breeds have one or more fancy points which serve to complicate selection as such seldom add to the usefulness of the animal ; yet they are a breed requirement and therefore must be considered , otherwise the animal may be disqualified . Good illustrations are noted in the Dutch Belted cow and Hampshire pig which must be black with a white belt about the body ; the Holstein-Friesian cow must be black and white with a long tail and large escutcheon ; the Jersey cow should have a black tongue ; the Ayrshire cow must have characteristically shaped horns and a straight back ; the Clydesdale // and English Shire draft horse must have long hairs growing from the back of the cannons and fetlocks ; chestnut color is favored among Suffolk draft horses and Hackney coach horses ; PolandChina and Berkshire swine must be black with six white points as well as free from curling hair along the back ; similar examples could be given , each of which must be considered thoroughly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . 193 . Breed peculiarities . ? In addition to the history and fancy points one must be familiar with the inherent peculiarities of the breed with which he is working . Thus he must realize that the Clydesdale is often deficient in rear ribs , which gives the body a rangy appearance ; that the English Shire is often rather straight in pastern , with heels low and flat ; that the Jersey cow is often rather delicate ; that the Holstein-Friesian is rather rough ; that the Hereford is often rather deficient in the quarters ; that Shorthorns are of many types ; that the Berkshire is often deficient in hams , and the Poland China in shoulders ; that the Chester White is a bit coarse ; that the Hampshire is of irregular coloring . The more familiar one is with such peculiarities , the greater are his chances of success in advancing the animals he is producing . 194 . Fashionable breeding . ? There is a growing tendency to stress certain strains , or families , and animals possessing certain characteristics . Such families may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result from the activity of some promoter , and the popularity may or may not be due to real merit . For a time animals belonging to such families often command a high price but , as a rule , the popularity gradually wanes . Good illustrations have been noted in the case of fashionable color among Shorthorns , Herefords , and Holstein-Friesians , as well as in the fleecing on the face and down the legs of Shropshires , and especially at the present time in the case of the " big type " among swine . A knowledge of such changes , their influence , and the possibility of their being replaced is essential . 195 . Registration . ? Each of the important breeds of farm animals has a society which looks after its interests . This society // publishes a record book in which may be recorded the ancestors of each animal of the breed . This is spoken of as " registration , " and the record as the " pedigree " of the animal . When thus recorded , the animal is called a pure-bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the class of animal registered . Thus in the case of horses , it is called a studbook ; in the case of cattle and swine , a herdbook ; and in the case of sheep , a flockbook. 196 . Standard of excellence . ? With a knowledge of the factors involved the breeder is in a position to determine a standard for his guidance in selecting animals . This should be established in the light of what is needed after due consideration of every influence including present conditions and prospective demands . As nearly every breed has its scale of points , this should be taken into account also in determining the ideal which it is wished to develop . Thus equipped the breeder is in a position intelligently to consider the animals on which he must rely to carry him forward in his breeding operations . 197 . Individuality in selection . ? The animal selected for breeding should be a good representative of the type and breed to which it belongs . The utility of type may not be denied , as certain types are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the draft and driving type , the former noted for its power and the latter for its action and speed . Likewise the significance of breed characteristics may not be denied , as the HolsteinFriesian cow is known for her large milk flow while the Jersey cow is equally as famous for the richness of her milk . Again , in the case of poultry , the White Leghorn is famous for her egg-laying capacity together with the white color of her eggs while the Plymouth Rock is noted for general utility although she ranks high in egg production . In a consideration of the individual , constitutional vigor should be stressed as such may determine the utility . This is significant especially when one selects for early maturity , general refinement , and the like as such factors often operate against constitutional // vigor and thrift . Too much emphasis can not be placed on indi vidual merit . 198 . Pedigree in selection . ? The capacity of the individual to reproduce itself depends largely on the purity of the ancestors . If the ancestors have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the offspring will be good ; if the ancestors have been poor for several generations , it is likewise reasonably certain that the offspring will be poor ; whereas if the ancestors have been mixed , some good and some poor , it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty what the offspring will be like . In view of such facts the character of the antes tors becomes a very significant factor in selecting breeding animals . In general , characters will be transmitted to the offspring in proportion to the degree with which they have become fixed in the ancestors . The pedigree of an ani mal is a guarantee of its character and purity . 199 . Tracing , writing , and studying a pedigree . ? Since most berdbooks give but one generation of ancestors , they do not provide // all of the desired information in selecting breeding animals . To secure this information in comprehensive form , it is necessary to trace down and write out the pedigree of the particular individuals under consideration . There are two methods of writing pedigrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is presented in detail and other ancestors are omitted , while in the other method all ancestors are recorded , and for convenience in study the pedigree is arranged in tabular form . The latter is the only one giving all the information although the former is much used . ( See page 26. ) 200 . Performance in selection . ? For many years an accurate record has been kept of speed in race horses and of milk and fat production in dairy cows . These records are compiled by the various breed associations so that there is now available the performance records , going back many generations , of thousands of horses and thousands of dairy cows . These records accurately tabulated with the pedigree and properly interpreted furnish valuable aids to breeders in selecting animals for breeding purposes . In recent years much of the advancement attained with dairy cattle has been due to an accurate knowledge of just what the animals have done in milk and butter-fat production . This has made it possible to propagate the high-producing cows and to eliminate the lowproducing animals . 201 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dairy cow are admitted to advanced register on the basis of their own performance , but it is different with the dairy bull . He is admitted to advanced register on the performance of his daughters , and no bull is recorded until he has four advanced-register daughters and then he is automatically admitted . Thus he has established his ability as a breeder , being able to produce offspring of advancedregister caliber . He has proved his genetic worth . The cows have proved their performance but not their ability to procreate performers . The latter may be obtained by comparing the advanced-register records of dam and daughter . It must be recognized clearly that as a basis for estimating the breeding powers of an animal , nothing compares with an accurate record of genetic // performance . The disadvantage of this method is that the animal must have attained sufficient age to have producing offspring before this test of efficiency may be applied . 202 . Prepotency in selection . ? The parent that has the superior power in determining the characters of the offspring is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the breeder because of the direct influence which it has on improvement . Indeed , individual prepotency and selection , based on records of performance , especially genetic , are the most powerful agencies for the improvement of herds as well as of the several breeds of farm animals at the will of the live-stock farmer . Good illustrations are noted in Justin Morgan ( Fig. 36 ) , the founder of the Morgan breed ; in Hambletonian 10 , the founder of the Hambletonian trotters ; in Denmark , the founder of the American saddle-horse breed . Indeed every breed , every family , every strain , and almost every herd shows the influence of some prepotent animal . REVIEW AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 .

CHAPTER VII CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES The horse is a very sensitive animal . He should be handled quietly and gently at all times . Striking or shouting commands at him is an inconsiderate practice . It not only causes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him less tractable , but it destroys nervous energy , thereby making the animal less useful . GROOMING AND CARE 203 . Cleaning and rubbing . ? Nothing contributes so much to the beauty and the luster of the coat as grooming . On arriving at the stable the animal should be fed , unharnessed , given a thorough grooming , and blanketed . The legs should be given a thorough and rapid brushing . Time spent in cleaning and rubbing the horse in the evening after the day 's work is done is worth much more than time thus spent in the morning . The cleaning and rubbing of the skin stimulates the secretions and improves the tone of the entire system , thereby promoting thrift and improving soundness and thus extending the period of the animal 's usefulness . 204 . Clipping consists in cutting the hair over the entire surface of the horse 's body . Several advantages are secured from clipping It improves the appearance of the horse and makes his coat more easy to keep clean ; a clipped horse is less liable to take cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the animal does not get so warm ; the natural process of shedding the hair is a draft on the vitality of the animal , indicated by diminished appetite and loss of flesh . Clipping accomplishes in a very short time what nature requires much time to do . 120 // When horses can not be protected from the cold and wet , either in the stable or outside of it , they should not be clipped in the fall . Animals exposed to the weather grow a long coat for their own protection . 205 . Blankets . ? In cold climates the use of blankets is indispensable . The horse will prove more efficient and will endure much longer if reasonably protected against sudden changes in temperature , cold rains , and heavy winds . On arriving at the stable very warm and sweating the horse should not be blanketed until he has ceased to steam as the blanket will become damp and the hair remain so all night . In case the blanket is not used until the animal is somewhat cooled , which will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry and smooth the following morning . Stable blankets may be dispensed with in the hot summer months if the flies are excluded by screens or by some // other means . If blankets are used at this time , they should be of light material and kept clean . As soon as the nights begin to get cool , the blankets should be resumed as an early use will arrest to a marked degree the growth of hair . This may obviate the necessity of clipping . In case the horse is clipped , he should be covered with an extra heavy blanket or with two blankets for a time . The use of the outdoor blanket is as important as the stable blanket . If the horse is allowed to stand out of doors , either for a short or for a long time , he should be well blanketed . If one is going to stop but a short time , the temptation is strong not to blanket the animal . The horse cools off rapidly and may chill ; so it is best to blanket if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The use of fly nets often brings much comfort to working animals . Such horses should be provided with throatlatch cloths when the botflies are present as these pests are very annoying and the animals in fighting them will often become excited , with a consequent lessening of their usefulness . Whether to use fly nets or fly blankets may depend on conditions . The use of the fly blanket is not advised by many persons , but there are conditions in which it proves very desirable , particularly on horses whose color is such as to fade on being exposed to the direct rays of the sun . The fly blanket , while very efficient in retaining the color and keeping out the flies , is not so presentable and is much warmer than the open net . Leather fly nets are the most presentable and the most desired by horsemen . Fly nets and fly blankets , however , are rather annoying to the teamster and are more or less expensive , for which reasons they are often discarded entirely . 207 . Care of the horse 's teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not looked after , they are likely to remain , causing the second , or permanent , teeth to grow in crooked . The young horse 's mouth should be watched closely , and the persistent milk teeth removed with forceps . The upper jaw is somewhat wider than the lower ; and as the teeth are not perfectly opposed , a sharp edge is left unworn on the inside of the lower molars and on the outside of the upper , which may cut the tongue or cheeks . The sharp edges should // be filed down by a guarded rasp ; otherwise the tongue and cheeks become sore , the food irritates them , and the horse will not feed well . 208 . Care of the feet . ? Because of the great importance of the foot , it should be cared for carefully throughout the active career of the horse . Each evening , after the horse returns from work the sole of the foot should be examined , and all foreign materials removed . For this purpose a small hay hook with the point sharpened is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , thus becoming hard and brittle . Such hoofs should be oiled with some good oil , such as linseed or olive oil , or with hoof ointment , of which there are many kinds on the market . This will soften the wall of the hoof and make it less likely to crack or break . It often happens that a piece is worn or broken from the side of the hoof , which throws the weight of the body in such a way as to bring a strain on the joints of the leg , causing deformity and disease . When such break occurs , the hoof should be leveled with a rasp . When horses are closely confined in the stable , the hoofs grow out long ; and if not trimmed , they will deform the limb and make traveling difficult . 209 . Growth of the hoof . ? The rate of growth of the hoof is of much importance , for one is often interested to know how long it will take a crack , such as quarter crack , side crack , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear . On the average the hoof grows one third of an inch a month . Hind hoofs grow faster than fore hoofs and unshod ones faster than shod . While influenced to some extent by work or exercise , grooming , moisture , and food , the time required for the horn to grow from the coronet to the ground varies in proportion to the distance from the coronet to the ground . The toe , therefore , depending on its height , grows down in ten to thirteen months , the sides in six to eight , and the heel in three to five months . 210 . Shoeing . ? The horse 's hoof wears off faster than it grows out , and it becomes sore . In order to prevent the hoof from wearing too rapidly , the feet are shod . For this purpose the light shoe is preferred . The horse is shod also to prevent slipping on // ice or mud . For this purpose , when the work is hard , heavy shoes with large calks are best , but for easy work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their action . In fitting a shoe it is important to keep the foot perfectly level , thus preventing undue weight being thrown on one side and other attendant injuries . The frog should be left its natural size and shape to serve as a cushion for the foot . In fitting a shoe nothing will aid so much as a careful examination of the wear of the old shoe . The shoe should be fitted cold or not so hot as to burn the sole when placed against it in fitting . In nailing the shoe to the foot , the nail holes should be well back , the nails small in size , and when driven should be brought out well down on the hoof . If driven high , when the animal is reshod , the former nail holes are near the edge and serve to weaken the hoofs and interfere with driving the new nails . After being driven the nails are to be clinched in a small groove fitted for that purpose . The nails should be smoothed with a rasp , but the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural protective covering , permitting the hoof to absorb water in the wet season and dry out much more rapidly in the dry season . 211 . Bedding the horse . ? A horse at hard work needs rest at night , and much more rest is possible when the animal is given a good liberal bed . The bedding should not be permitted to become foul , as this will not only lessen the comfort of the animal but will promote disease as well . Of bedding materials straw leads the list ; but when high in price , it may be replaced by other materials , such as shavings from the planing mill , rejected parts of corn stalks , tan bark , leaves , and the like . Old straw is preferred to new , as it is dryer and more elastic . The more broken and bruised the straw , the less is its bulk and elasticity and the greater the quantity that must be used . TRAINING THE COLT The usefulness of the horse will depend much on his courage and fearlessness , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with man at as early an age as possible . A colt should never be frightened . Too many persons thoughtlessly try to make the young colt show off by doing something to startle it , by running at it , throwing sticks , " shooing " it , and the like . This should never be done if a reliable animal is to be developed . 212 . Handling the colt . ? The foal should be taught very early the uses of the halter . In handling the colt one should be careful about the ears , the back of the fore legs , and the flanks , as these are often very sensitive . The colt should be handled by putting one hand under the neck and the other under the hams or around the // buttocks ( Fig. 38 ) . If he attempts to go forward , he should be pressed back with the hand under his neck ; and if he attempts to go backward , he should be pressed forward with the hand that is around the buttocks . The colt should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and thus make it difficult to catch him again . 213 . Training to lead ( Fig. 39 ) . ? When ready to halter the foal , a strong , well-fitting halter should be selected , not a new one that smells of many things that are new to the colt , but one that has recently been used . Care should be taken not to pull heavily on the noseband at any time . Occasionally deformed face lines and necks are caused in this way as the harder a colt is pulled , the harder he holds back . If , on the contrary , he is coaxed along the accustomed route , as to the water trough and back , he will soon follow promptly . If he resents , however , other means must be tried . A small rope the size of a light sash cord , about ten feet long , should be secured , and a noose tied or a ring fastened on one end . This should be placed gently over the colt 's back just in front of the hips with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body so that , when the other end of the rope is run through the noose , the rope can be closely drawn // around the flanks ; the rope should be passed along under the body , then between the fore legs , then up through the ring in the halter . With the halter strap in one hand and the light rope in the other , the halter strap may be pulled gently ; and as the colt begins to shake his head if the light rope is given a sharp pull , the colt will immediately step forward . 214 . Importance of a good mouth . ? No factor contributes so much to the pleasure , comfort , and safety of either rider or driver as a responsive mouth in a horse one that always obeys promptly the slightest instruction from the master . A good mouth to a large extent is natural to the horse . Tender and bad mouths usually result from improper handling . Bad mouths are very aggravating and often the cause of many other imperfections ? tongue lolling , crossing the jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ? many of which when well established are very difficult to overcome . Inasmuch as the conveyance of the master 's desire to the horse 's mind for execution is through the hands , reins , bit , and mouth , no progress can be made , and none should be attempted until this means of communication has been well established . 215 . Bitting the colt . It is best perhaps to train the horse to the uses of the bit when he is about two years of age . The young animal can usually be made familiar with the uses of the bit by the application of the bitting harness . This harness consists of an open bridle with a large smooth bit and checkrein , a surcingle and crupper , and two side lines running from the bit to buckles on each side of the surcingle ( Fig.40 ) . The adjustment of the bridle is important . The length of the headstall must be so adjusted as to bring the bit in mild contact with the bars of the mouth . With the bitting harness properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open paddock to get used to having the bit in his mouth . The checkrein and side reins should be left slack at first . Gradually from day to day the reins should be shortened , care being taken that they are never made so short as to place the head in an uncomfortable position , or the bit drawn so tightly as to make the // corners of the mouth sore . The colt should be subjected to the use of this apparatus for a few hours each clay for perhaps a week or less , depending on the individual . Real lines may now be substituted for the side reins , and the colt driven until he knows how to guide this way and that , to stop at the word " whoa , " and to step forward at the command " get up . " The colt should be trained to stand absolutely still when being harnessed , saddled , or when it is desired that he should stand . 216 . Hitching single . ? When the colt is desired for single use , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . This may be done after he has become familiar with the bit , the harness , and the use of the lines . When training the colt to ga single , a training cart ? one with long shafts , substantially conCARE // strutted , and with the seat so arranged that the driver can get off and on quickly ? should be employed . The shafts should be twelve or fourteen feet long , with provision at the ends for the attachment of a strap across from point to point to prevent the colt in rearing from throwing his front leg over the end of the shaft . At first a kicking strap attached to each shaft and passed over the colt 's rump should be used , at least till the colt is accustomed to the shafts . When the colt is first hitched , an assistant should hold him until the driver is ready ; then he should be allowed to go . As soon as he has become familiar with the vehicle , he should be compelled to stand still until he is wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? With the harness properly adjusted , the colt is ready to be hitched to a vehicle . A well-trained , gentle , but active horse should be selected if the colt is active , for it is a lllistake to hitch a quick , active colt with a slow , lazy horse . The // vehicle to which they are attached should be provided with a good brake . The colt should be attached en the " off side , " and the team driven at first in a closed field till the colt learns what is wanted of him . When hitching the colt double for the first few times , it is well to keep on the colt 's bridle a pair of single lines which can be handled by an assistant . The harness should be of good quality and in good repair ; if a part breaks , there may be trouble , and the colt ruined for all time . The colt 's shoulders are likely to be tender and easily abraded ; so the collar must fit him well . A breast collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crupper also need careful attention . Care should be taken to have them neither too loose nor too tight and then to keep them clean lest they abrade the back or tail and produce a vicious horse . HARNESSES AND HARNESSING 218 . Proper adjustment . In harnessing the horse much care should be exercised in properly adjusting the various parts of the harness . Properly fitted harness adds much to the efficiency . and comfort of the horse . This is well emphasized by the sore mouth , shoulders , neck , back , and tail produced by poorly fitted harness . The tension on these parts is rather great ; and as they are very tender , they are the places likely first to show abrasion . Sores thus produced give the horse much pain and are likely to become a cause of viciousness . Sore mouth thus often provokes a horse to run away ; sore shoulders and neck often cause balking ; and a sore tail often provokes kicking . The efficiency and comfort of the horse depend largely on the adjustment of the bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bit . ? Bits of many types have been devised to meet the various and peculiar habits of horses , most of which have been designed to punish the horse and irritate the sensitive parts . With the punishment of the whip at the rear and a harsh and severe bit at the front , the horse is between two goads ; and if he does not balk , rear , plunge , or run away , he is exceptional . // A good-sized straight bit covered with leather or rubber , if the mouth is tender , can not be improved on in most cases . One must be careful to secure a bit of the proper length for the horse 's mouth . Many bits are too long and are pulled out of adjustment in the mouth , so that the pressure on either side is not equal . The bit must be of the correct length for the particular animal and properly adjusted . Some horses work better with the jointed , or snaffle , bit . It gives more room for the tongue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the straight bit . Severe bits , of which there are many in the market and which are intended for punishment , should never be used unless it is absolutely necessary . In the training and driving of high-acting horses the curb bit may be used . A horse properly bitted with this shows himself to better advantage than with any other kind of bit . The curb bit should be used only by those who are familiar with it as it may become an instrument of torture in the hands of the inexperienced . 220 . The checkrein should be properly adjusted . In common practice there are two methods of checking the horse 's head ? by means of the side rein and by the overcheck rein . The former is used more often on work horses , the latter on driving horses . The side rein is used with and without check hooks at the throatlatch . This rein is not so effective as the overcheck rein in compelling the animal to hold his head up , but it is much more comfortable for the horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the side rein are not so likely to stumble as those with the overcheck rein , and they will pull a much heavier load . This is because they have more liberty with the head , are able to see the ground immediately in front , and can lower the head and thus throw more power into the collar . The horse should always be reined mildly . Without the rein he is likely to become careless in his habits , shambling in his gait , and to yield to the temptation to eat grass when standing . When the animal lowers his head and neck , the lines , collar , and breast132 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY harness slip down and he is likely to become tangled in the harness and may get into difficulty . 221 . Fitting the collar . ? The service of the horse is largely accomplished by the shoulders , and it is of the utmost importance that the collar fit the neck and shoulders perfectly . Poorly fitted collars cause the horse much pain , result in sore necks and shoulders , and are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme importance of having a well-fitting collar , many makes have been put on the market , such as the leather , the sweeny , the half-sweeny , the pneumatic , the steel , and the humane , superiority over the others being claimed for each ( Fig. 42 ) . All have advantages and disadvantages . Fitting the collar is a rather difficult task . It is so firm and stiff that usually it is impossible to buckle the harness tight enough to bring it to the shape of the animal 's neck , and the shoulders are therefore adjusted to the collar rather than the collar to the shoulders , sore shoulders being the result . To avoid this soreness , it is necessary that the stiff collar be adjusted to the shoulders of the horse for which it is intended . Every horse should have his own collar . It should fit close to the neck along its entire width and should never be tight in some places and loose in others . The hame straps should be properly adjusted at top and bottom to suit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure at all times that the lower hame strap is buckled . // as tightly as the thickness of the neck will permit . Occasionally the careless driver fails to buckle the hames tightly , and when t he horse is backed , the hames slip off the collar . 222 . Breast harness . ? For light driving breast harness is permissible and is to be preferred for such light rigs as runabouts and buggies . In the adjustment of breast harness care should be taken that the neck strap is not so long as to let the breast harness drop and interfere with the action of the fore limbs . On the other hand the neck strap should not be so short as to draw the breast harness up and choke the animal . The breast harness is intended for light work only ; and if the load is heavy , the horse may choke . This is particularly true in ascending a steep grade . 223 . Fitting the back strap and crupper . ? Perhaps next in importance to the bit and collar is the crupper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crupper is drawn too tightly against the tail , it is likely to cause soreness ; since this is a very tender part , it may lessen the reliability of the horse . A horse with a , sore tail is hard to manage . At any time he may get his tail over t he line , become excited through fear that the abraded part will be injured , clamp his tail down on the line , and be difficult to control . 224 . Caring for harness . ? The proper care of the harness should receive much consideration , as care will increase the length of its usefulness and lessen the liability of its injuring the animal . I t is very important that the bearing parts be kept scrupulously clean at all times . This applies particularly to the parts in constant contact with the animal , the collar , saddle , and crupper . It is not possible to prevent sore shoulders , sore back , and sore t ail if these parts are permitted to become dirty , which they will , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleaned frequently . CARE OF THE SICK HORSE The horse is the most healthful of farm animals when given his freedom and properly managed . His troubles begin when closely confined , overworked , improperly fed or watered , and denied exer134 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY cise . Under such conditions he is subject to numerous ailments , some being simple and easily cared for but more being complicated and requiring skilled treatment . 225 . Treating sick horses . ? Horses that are ailing should receive proper care . In many cases good care is to be preferred to the use of medicine . In other cases rest is to be preferred to both . The aim is to hasten recovery from the ill effects of the ailment , and to be most successful one must understand the horse thoroughly and be able to supply his every need . He must be careful , painstaking , and patient . The first thing to be done is to look for the cause of the trouble and , if possible , to remove it . If the disease is contagious , the ailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the disease . The quarters should be comfortable . In certain ailments it is necessary to protect the horse against the cold or from drafts . This can be done by the use of blankets . To protect the limbs bandages may be applied . The bandage should be made from strips of woolen cloth about three inches wide and five to eight feet long , fixed into a neat roll , then applied by beginning at the lower or smaller part of the limb and winding upward . 226 . Feeding sick horses . ? The food should receive much attention . When the horse can eat , a small quantity of easily digestible and nutritious food should be given . The food should not contain much bulk and should be rather laxative , as sickness often brings constipation . It should be as attractive as possible as the appetite is usually poor and sometimes lacking . When it can be prevented , medicine should not be put in the food or water unless tasteless and odorless as the horse is likely to refuse the food when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as fresh grass , roots , bran mash , and milk , are to be preferred . The feed boxes should be kept clean ; and if any food is left , it should be removed and not left until the next meal . 227 . Condimental food . ? In some cases a conditioner or tonic may be helpful to stimulate the appetite and otherwise improve // the general thrift of the animal . Numerous formulae have been suggested , the following by Winslow 1 : Dried sodium sulfate , 40 parts by weight ; sodium bicarbonate , 35 parts ; common salt , 15 parts ; and potassium sulfate , 2 parts . These materials should he mixed and powdered . For mature horses 1 to 2 heaping table-spoonfuls and for mature cattle 1i to 3 heaping tablespoonfuls should be given two to three times daily in the feed . The dose for sheep and swine is one fifth that of the horse , and to young ani mals according to size should be given one half as much as to the mature animal , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailments of the horse . Such ills are caused by indigestible food , improper feeding . and watering , and any similar cause that profoundly disturbs the digestive system . They may occur in either mild or acute form . During attacks the horse refuses his feed , lies down , gets up at once , paws the ground , looks toward the flanks , stands stretched , and shows evidence of the pain he is suffering . In colic the pain may be intermittent , coming on suddenly . The respiration and the pulse increase rapidly , and the horse may perspire profusely . The object in the care of the horse is to avoid such disorders by proper management . Azoturia results from high feeding and lack of exercise . It comes on quickly after the horse has been standing idle a few days , attacking him after he has traveled a short distance . He acts confused and perspires profusely , the muscles tremble , the hind parts become difficult to control ; and if not stopped , he may go down and be unable to rise again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be overcome by getting the horse into comfortable quar ters and placing warm blankets over the loins . Daily exercise will prevent the ailment as will a reduction in the ration if he is stand ing idle . Worms . The horse is liable to infection by intestinal worms which reduce his vitality and usefulness . The worms usually gain lodgment when the horse is thin in flesh and otherwise // out of condition . So keeping the horse in a vigorous and thrifty condition by proper feeding and care usually will prevent worms . In many cases the infected horse that is given a good variety and an abundance of laxative food with some tonic may recover his normal vigor. 231 . Distemper . ? This ailment affects the air passages and the glands of the throat . The disease is infectious , and one attack usually renders the horse immune . Colts are most susceptible . There is partial loss of appetite , with a feverish condition followed by nasal secretions and the formation of pus in the air passages and , later , by abscesses under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pain is less severe . Rest , comfortable quarters , nourishing food , and good care constitute the necessary treatment for the average case of distemper . To prevent the ailment , all places likely to carry the infection should be avoided , such as the public watering trough , hitching sheds , livery stables , and the like . 232 . Influenza appears as a catarrhal inflammation of the respiratory and other mucous membranes . It is infectious . There is loss of appetite with a high fever . The horse seems much depressed , standing with his head down . There may be sneezing and a troublesome cough . The mucous membranes of the eyes are often inflamed , giving rise to the name " pink eye . " Rest , a light diet , a comfortable , clean , and well-ventilated stall free from drafts constitute an essential part of the treatment . To prevent the ailment , places likely to carry the infection should be avoided . 233 . Sore shoulders are often due to poorly fitting or dirty collars and to certain kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In mild cases the parts may be washed with cold salt water and , when dry , dusted with antiseptic powder . Oxide of zinc ointment is good . 234 . Scratches affect the skin at the heel and are often called " grease heel . " They are due to filth and are more common on the hind legs because of the exposure to manure . The parts should be cleansed by clipping the hair and bathing in warm water // with tar soap . A poultice of scalded bran or linseed meal should be applied , being changed twice in twenty-four hours . After the scabs are removed , the parts are cleansed , wiped dry , and an antiseptic , such as boric acid , applied , being dusted into the sores , which are then covered with some oily dressing like vaseline . 235 . Colt ailments . ? The young foal is rather subject to such ailments as navel infection and digestive disorders , resulting in constipation and diarrhea . Such diseases may often be avoided by providing clean and comfortable quarters at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the mare foals , the quarters should be disinfected . Then lime should be scattered about the floor which , in addition , should be accessible to the sun 's rays . Diarrhea often results from overfeeding , in which case it may be necessary to milk the mare , in part , by hand ; and constipation may result from lack of sufficient colostrum , or first milk , which suggests the use of a laxative . REVIEW AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 . Discuss the advantages of grooming . Why should the horse be groomed in the evening after the day 's work is done rather than in the morning ? 2 . When should a horse be clipped ? Which has the finer coat , a clipped or an unclipped horse ? How does the use of the blanket affect the coat , or hair ? 3 . Discuss the care of a horse 's teeth ; of his feet . Why should the . colt 's foot be rasped and leveled frequently ? What is the function of the frog ?

Name and describe the common ailments of the horse . Name the more common colt ailments and tell how each may often be avoided . PROJECT QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES When making survey and judging visits , inquire about methods of care and management , especially the feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacksmiths and inquire about the manner of shoeing the draft and the driving horse and especially about methods of improving the action of the latter . Gentle a young colt and train , first , to lead and , later , to drive ; but do not put a bit in the young colt 's mouth . Snap the lines in the rings at either side of the halter . If arrangements can be made , observe some horseman hitch a colt for the first time and give a report on the method used . Visit the horsebreeder 's farm when he is choosing and fitting animals for show . Study his methods and try your hand , beginning with groom ing . Learn to work the rosette in mane and tail and to hold the horse so as to show his form and then to lead him so as to show his action . In connection with Laboratory Exercise 7 ( page 557 ) adjust a set of harness to the horse . Adjust a riding saddle . Adjust a pack saddle . Accompany a veterinarian when he is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis as well as the symptoms of the sick animal . CHAPTER VIII FACTORS INFLUENCING DRAFT WORK The horse is the main beast of burden and the chief reliance for power on the farm ( Fig. 43 ) . He is active , energetic , and easily trained to perform his work under any circumstances . Because of his universal adaptation , hitherto he has often been worked under conditions not suited to promote his greatest usefulness . The competition of gas-driven machinery has resulted in an interest in the improvement of these conditions . Standard of work . ? In measuring the amount of work a horse may perform the foot ton is the unit , and in measuring the rate at which the horse performs work the horse power is the standard . A foot ton is the work done in lifting one ton one foot against gravity , and a horse power is the power required to lift 33,000 pounds at the rate of one foot a minute . The power a horse develops is calculated by multiplying the distance traveled by the rate of speed and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse power . Thus the horse power developed by a 1200-pound horse walking 2.5 miles an hour exerting a steady pull of one eighth his weight , or 150 pounds , would be as follows : As the horse power is 33,000 foot pounds a minute , this con tinued for an eight-hour day would equal 7920 foot tons of work done . In a ten-hour day this allows two hours for various time losses as in turning , adjusting machinery , and the like . 237 . Power a horse may develop . ? The work that a horse can do depends on his weight , his muscular development , and his 139 // endurance . He performs his work in various ways , such as traveling and driving , carrying and saddling , draft and hauling . When working continuously for an eight-hour day at the rate of 2.5 miles an hour , a horse may exert a pull of one tenth to one eighth of his body weight without special fatigue . This may be considered the average working draft . A horse may pull with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very short periods of time under favorable conditions he may exert a pull equal to one half , or even three fourths , of his weight although it is unsafe often to repeat such strains or to continue them long at a time . 238 . Importance of weight . ? Weight brought forward is power in itself , and the greater the weight brought forward , the greater is the power derived from it . As a rule about five ninths of a horse 's // weight is borne by his front legs and four ninths by his hind legs . Weight holds the horse to the ground , enabling him to secure a footing against which to exert his strength . The advantage of weight is emphasized by the tabulation which shows the power developed by horses of various weights and the foot tons of work done when working for an eight-hour day at 2.5 miles an hour , exerting a traction equal to one tenth and one eighth of their own weights : This explains why the overloaded draft horse , when the driver mounts upon the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not move without the extra weight on his back . 239 . Direction of line of draft . To favor the horse the line of draft should extend at right angles to the shoulders ; since this line passes as low as the hocks it enables the horse to use his strength and weight to advantage . The greater the slope of the trace , the more is the advantage as it favors secure footing and places the horse in a favorable position to lift as well as to push . So important is the sloping trace that with an angle of twenty degrees the horse can use his weight and strength to such advantage as to enable him to draw practically twice as much as when the traces are horizontal . 240 . Attachment of the traces to the harness . ? The traces should be attached to the harness as low as the comfort of the horse and other conditions will permit . When the traces are thus attached , the horse can use his weight to best advantage in draft . // This correction must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lengthening the hame straps above or shortening them below . The animal with a relatively long body has greater leverage and can use his weight to better advantage than the short-coupled individual . Strength of the hock joint . ? The muscles of the leg are subjected to a great strain in straightening the hock joint so as to force the body forward and the load after it . The width of the hock joint of the draft horse is of no less importance than the strength of the muscle . The traction a horse can develop depends on the width or , as stated by King , ' on the ratio between the two arms of the lever upon which the hock muscles act . Thus if the projec-tion of the bone which forms the point of the hock is long in comparison with the distance to the hoof as represented in Fig. 44 at the left , instead of short as shown at the right , then it is evident that with a given strength of hock muscle the former will be able to straighten the leg with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw is thereby increased . Horse power required to plow . ? The draft required to draw a plow varies widely , depending on the kind and condition of soil as well as width and depth of furrow . It requires a traction of about 2.5 pounds a square inch to plow light soil and on up to 12.5 pounds to plow stiff clay soils . The importance of soil moisture on the draft is significant as is shown by a test conducted with a sod plow in clover sod two years old when in good tilth and later when the soil was dryer . In the former case the draft required was 3.52 pounds a square inch while the latter was 8.61 pounds . Thus // the influence of the condition of the soil is emphasized in the tabu-lation which shows the horse power required for different widths and depths both for moist and dry soils , according to King . ' Effect of soil filth . ? By consulting the table showing daily work performed by horses of various weights , it appears that two 1200-pound horses find their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in moist soil but lack the power to draw a 12-inch plow cutting four inches deep in dry soil . A three-horse team of 1600-pound horses finds its capacity overtaxed by a 12-inch plow cutting six inches deep in dry soil although such a team may draw a two-gang , 14-inch plow cutting six inches deep in moist soil . Thus the horse working in soil of good filth may accomplish more than twice as much as when plowing in dry soil or that which is out of condition ( Fig. 45 ) . Horse power required to haul . ? There are many factors that determine the draft required to haul a load , chief of which are : the condition , grade , and smoothness of the roadbed ; the height of wheel , width of tire , and rigidity of the truck or wagon ; the direction of the line of draft and to some extent the distribution of the load on the truck . The load should be so placed over the wheels as to be in proportion to the surface of the wheels on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // which may become serious if the load is high , as in the case of hauling hay or straw . 245 . Good roads . ? The draft of hauling a four-wheeled truck over roads of different character requires about 45 pounds a ton on pavement , 60 pounds on macadam , 140 pounds on improved dirt roads , and as much as 225 pounds a ton on unimproved dirt roads . Thus a team of 1000-pound horses drawing with ease two tons on a macadam road may find its capacity taxed on the un improved dirt road . The draft increases with the grade of the roadbed . A 1 per cent grade increases the draft 1 per cent of the weight of the load over what it would be on the same road if level . A 2 per cent grade increases the draft by 2 per cent of the weight of the load , and so on . // A yielding roadbed is objectionable as it increases the draft more than any other factor . Ruts , stones , and other obstructions increase the traction . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the radius of the wheel doubles the draft . Thus , in the case of a wheel 48 inches in diameter , an obstruction of 4 per cent would be less than 1 inch , yet the traction required to draw the load is increased by more than 100 ' per cent . This explains much of the difference in draft between the macadam and the dirt road and gives an idea of the serious disadvantage occasioned the draft horse that must work on unimproved roads . 246 . Type of truck . ? The draft required to draw a load is in fluenced by the height of wheel , width of tire , and rigidity of the truck or wagon as springs under the load give elasticity and di-minish the draft . As ishes with the increasiriglength of the lever it is apparent that high wheels have an advantage over low ones ( Fig. 46 ) . Thus with high wheels averaging 50 inches and low averaging 26 inches in height , it required a traction of 85 pounds for the former and 110 pounds for the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This shows a saving of about 25 per cent in favor of high wheels . Under most conditions wide tires reduce the draft of hauling about 25 per cent as compared with narrow tires although there are exceptions , as when the road is so sticky as to roll up on the wheels thus loading them down . When narrow-tired trucks make // deep ruts in the road which the wide tires tend to fill up , they give higher draft than wide tires. 247 . Multiple hitches . ? As man labor is one of the chief factors in the cost of production , it is imperative to make the most of it , and one way of accomplishing this is to multiply his usefulness by placing more power at his disposal . This may be done by increasing the number of horses he works . On grain farms or where there is considerable heavy work to be done , one man may accomplish as much as several under the old method of one man to each pair of horses . Where one man controls a number of horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In either case the two important factors to consider are the equalization of the draft and the method of control in driving . 248 . Horses abreast . ? In this method the horses are worked abreast ( Fig. 47 ) . It has the advantage of placing the horses near the load and driver ; thus a better control is given . It is much used in fitting the soil for crops . To meet the demand numerous forms of equalizers have been devised , the object being so to distribute the draft that each horse shall pull his proportionate share of the whole . These eveners are made in sections so that it is possible to work any number of horses abreast . When used on the farm , this method has many disadvantages , such as difficulty in turning , trampling , crowding , and excessive heating , especially in the case of the inside horses . Most important of all in plowing one or more of the horses must walk on the plowed ground , or if three or four horses only are used and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases the traction of plowing between 15 and 30 per cent . 249 . Horses tandem . ? In this method the pairs are hitched one in front of the other . It has the advantage of avoiding side draft and of permitting all animals to walk on solid ground when plowing . Numerous appliances have been devised to equalize the draft when two pairs are used ; but when more are employed , the draft is equalized either by varying the proportionate length of the eveners as shown in Fig. 48 or by a block and tackle , the pulleys of which US ANIMAL HUSBANDRY are so arranged as to distribute the draft accord ing to the number of pairs . In either method the lines are placed on the leading pair , each of the others being tied in so that it can neither work ahead nor lag behind . It is only necessary to drive the lead pair ; the others must follow and draw their share of the load . In this method , because of the space necessary for turning , it is difficult to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IMPROVEMENT OF IIORSES In the United States the number of horses and mules consumed , or used up , in a year is estimated at one and one half millions , including export horses . These horses must be replaced as con sumed . This replacement affords an excellent opportunity to improve the horse so as to increase his usefulness . 250 . Plan of improvement . ? A clearly de-fined plan of procedure should be thought out before the farmer makes the attempt to breed horses . To do this a good knowledge of horses and horse breeding should be secured . Breeding establishments and horse-producing farms should be visited . One should familiarize himself with the methods of successful breeders , should note the conditions that lead to success and those that cause failure . The horse producer should study his conditions . Some conditions will be favorable to the production of one class , some to another . It should be kept clearly in mind , whatever the type or class chosen , whether it is light or heavy , for speed or draft , that none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be an overproduction of common // horses , which will be the first to be affected by oversupply and business depressions and the last to be revived . The market should be studied also . In some sections the demand will be for a certain class , and in other sections another class will be in most demand . 251 . Cooperative breeding . ? From observations made in localities in which horses are bred in a commercial way , it would seem advisable to breed on the cooperative plan . It is apparent that the formation of horse-breeding associations in townships and counties would do much to advance the progress of the industry . Such associations should be formed of breeders who possess the same class or breed of mares . It would be the work of such an association to protect the interests of its members , provide suitable stallions each year for use on the mares owned by the members , advertise stock , attract buyers , hold sales , make exhibits at the county , district , and state fairs , hold meetings for discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better methods of breeding , feeding , and developing marketable horses . Selecting breeding stock . ? In the selection of breeding stock , the principle of heredity that " like produces like " must be // kept in mind . This applies to the brood mare as well as to the stallion . Bad qualities in the mare are as likely to appear in the colt as are bad qualities possessed by the stallion . The influence of the mare in the transmission of qualities to the foal is often underestimated and frequently ignored entirely by horse breeders . This can not be other than a serious mistake , and the farmer who keeps worthless mares for breeding merely because he can not sell them will not be able to compete with his neighbor who keeps only the best brood mares , even though they both use the same stallion . It is a serious but common error in breeding horses to suppose that the bad points in one animal can be fully offset or overcome by the good points in the mate . The statement that the stallion controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many breeders to think that the offspring would resemble the paternal parent irrespective of the mother . Such is not the case . The foundation of successful horse breeding is to mate two animals each of which is as nearly perfect as possible . 253 . The breed and type . ? The breed which best suits the conditions , the markets , and the tastes of the breeders should be chosen . There is no best breed or type for all conditions . Light horses naturally belong on land devoted to grass , to the dairy industry , and to market gardening where but little plowing and other heavy horse work is required and the necessity of reaching the market , the station , or the creamery requires quick-moving horses . On farms devoted to fruit growing and the like where the horse work is somewhat heavier than on the dairy farm , the coach horse may be used . Coach horses are well adapted to fruit farms with one exception ? they are rather too tall to be used to best advantage in tilling under trees in the orchards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work to be done is hard , heavy horses are needed . On general farms the draft horse finds his true place . Draft horses can be raised with less risk than the lighter and more active types , such as the roadster // and the coachers . They do not require so much training and can be put to light work younger . The draft horse is in demand for city traffic . The roadster and the coacher require much training before they can be marketed if good values are to be secured . This training requires skill , time , and money , which should be taken into account . A well-bred and well-trained coach or driving team will bring a good price , but the skill , time , and money required to breed and train them is too great for the general farmer . 254 . Uniformity . ? Each community should produce horses uniform in type . As it is now , each district produces a number of types . For this reason buyers in search of a particular type or breed of horses do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there throughout a wide territory and at a great outlay for // traveling expenses individual horses of the right type , until the lot has been gathered together . Such districts may sell large numbers of horses annually , but they are of nondescript type and character . These horses neither make a name for the district as a horse-breeding center nor attract buyers willing to pay appreciative prices . The individual farmer will do better to cast in his lot with the majority of his neighbors and breed the same type as they are breeding even though this type may nOt be the one that suits his fancy best or even that is best suited to the district . 255 . Soundness . ? It is of great importance that the stallion be free from all forms of unsoundness or disease that are hereditary , transmissible , or communicable to the offspring . It is equally important that the mares bred to him should be sound in the same way , for not until both mare and stallion used for breeding purposes are free from unsoundness can the excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding and development .

CHAPTER IX BREEDS OF CATTLE There are two distinct types of cattle : first , the dairy type , adapted for the production of milk ; and second , the beef type , employed for the production of beef . These types are controlled by the demands made on the body of the animal . For example , in milk production the udder is perhaps as important an organ as any whereas in beef production it is needed only to sustain the young .. Again , in the case of beef it is very important that the animal take on flesh and that the body be plump and full whereas in the production of milk this would be considered an objection , as the food should go to milk and not to fat . These two types are of necessity widely different and one can no more have maximum milk and beef production in the same cow than he can secure maximum speed and force in the same horse . 256 . The dairy type . ? Dairy cows are useful for the milk they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as the food goes to produce milk and not fat , the body will be spare and not fleshy . The secretion of milk takes place in the udder and allied organs ; therefore the rear development will be large . Furthermore , one can not have large production without a large factory ; thus a large secretion of milk calls for a large digestive tract , which adds to the rear development ( Fig. 51 ) . In general appearance the form of the dairy cow resembles that of a triple wedge . Viewed from the side , she shows greater depth of body behind than in front . Seen from the rear and top , she gradually widens from the chest to the hips . Viewed from the front and top , she gradually widens from the withers backward and downward to the abdomen . While this is the 157 // desired form and many superior cows possess it , yet exceptions occur , and many heavy milkers are not associated with this form . Fleshiness , however , is distinctly objectionable in the milking cow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more perfectly adapted to milk production are spoken of as the major dairy breeds while those less well-suited are called minor dairy breeds . 257 . Jersey dairy cattle . ? The Island of Jersey is one of a group known as the Channel Islands , situated in the English Channel a few miles off the coast of France but belonging to Great Britain . The principal islands of the group are Jersey , the largest , Guernsey , Alderney , and Sark . The climate is mild and balmy . The exact origin of the cattle on the Island of Jersey is uncertain . Because of the color , however , it has been assumed that they descended from stock on the neighboring section of France , particularly Normandy and Brittany . The fawn color has been attributed to the cattle of Normandy , while the blacker color has been credited to the Brittany cattle . At an early date , however , steps were taken to keep the breed pure by preventing outside cattle coming into the Island . In 1763 an act was passed , which has since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing of cattle on the Island except for // the purpose of slaughter . Even before the enactment of laws , the purity of the cattle was maintained by the persistency with which the people of the Island clung to their own breed . There are about 40,000 cattle on the Island . In 1833 the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society was organized with the purpose of improving the cattle . In 1834 the society originated a score card for Jerseys ; in 1836 it recommended that one superior breeding animal be kept in each parish ; and in 1838 it enacted several rules which were useful in the development of the Jersey breed . 258 . Inspection of Jersey cattle . ? On the Island of Jersey the high standing of the breed is preserved by a system of inspection which is made a conditional precedent to registration . The following are the requirements : ( 1 ) Every animal must be inspected by competent judges ; and if it is considered fit , it obtains a qualification ; namely , commended or highly commended . ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dam in order that the merits of the latter may be taken into consideration in awarding a commendation to the former . ( 3 ) No heifer , although she may be descended from registered parents , can be entered in the herdbook until she has a calf ; and if at the time of her examination she is a poor milker , she receives no commendation. 259 . The Jersey in America . ? While a minor importation was made as early as 1818 , it was not until 1850 that Jersey history began in America . In that year a number of Jerseys were brought from the Island to the vicinity of Hartford , Connecticut . Numerous other importations followed , and the breed soon became established in the Eastern states . Later it became widely distributed throughout the country . As the Jersey readily adapted itself to American conditions , it became very popular when a rather small , early-maturing , good-grazing family cow was needed , the rich milk providing both cream and butter for home consumption . Jerseys are divided into two groups : first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
