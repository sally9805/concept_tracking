Pierre Etchebaster , a Basque from St. Jean de Luz and the Jeu de Paume of Paris , beat the best court tennis players in the U. S. last week in Philadelphia . Jock Soutar , Britisher , met him in the finals for the national championship in the Racquet Club of Philadelphia . <P> Etchebaster wears a Basque cap , a Basque mustache , a Basque smile . He moves around the court very little . He plays his floor shots with a delicate , excessive turn of the wrist that cuts the ball down sharply over the low looping net . Jay Gould called his floor shots " invincible . " Soutar , running around , breathing hard , scored his points to the dedans and grille , made his best fight in the seventh game , then lost three games in succession , the match , and the title . <P> American professionals had thought it was ridiculous for Etchebaster , with his limited experience , to play the great Soutar . When they saw him practice they admitted that his shoulder stroke was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . After the match Soutar went to the dressing room and poked Etchebaster in the ribs . Mr. Joseph Widener went to the dressing room and gave him a two thousand dollar side-bet . Etchebaster ( pronounced-bastaire ) retained his calm . <P> Court tennis is one of the most complicated games in the world . It has changed very little since two kings imprisoned in a palace courtyard invented it and other kings in other courtyards played it in hose and doublet . In the gallery of the Racquet and Tennis Club of New York is a king 's throne copied from one the Bourbons used to sit on to watch their sons and relatives . <P> Court tennis is still played with a lopsided racquet , a low net , a court with a sloping roof . Each point is played twice . The spot where a player loses a point is marked and then the other player tries to beat this mark . On the net line sit individuals chanting in a monotonous voice . " Four-better than three-worse than three . . . . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes bulletlike noises as it hits the walls . Extra racquets are piled at the side of the court . Breaking one , a player grabs another , finishes the point . Sometimes in a hard game a champion breaks five or six racquets in succession . They cost fourteen dollars apiece . Court tennis players hold their racquets toward the middle , near where the rivet would be on a tennis racquet . Jay Gould was famous for his " Railroad service " which climbs along the penthouse , dropping almost dead . Etchebaster has a service like Gould's.
