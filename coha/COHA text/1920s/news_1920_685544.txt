txt Governor James M. Cox declared today that his campaign would be devoted to the task of paving the way for peace with honor and for a readjustment of the affairs of civilization . The statement was made in reply to one by his Republican opponent , Senator Warren G. Harding , in which the Senator initiated that the League of Nations issue had been forced upon the Democratic Party by President Wilson ; that the Democratic National Convention , under pressure from the White House , had made it the paramount issue through declarations in the platform , and that the candidates were giving blind obedience to the Presidential mandate . " Senator Harding , " the Governor Said , " has made two definite announcements  --  that he purposes to hark back to the days of thirty years ago , and that ho will make of his front porch a listening post . This means that he will be as far removed from the running current of progressive thought as the Senatorial oligarchy of Lodge and Penrose and Smoot has been removed from the heartbeats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My campaign will be dedicated to the tank of bringing peace with honor , of readjusting the affairs of civilization , and of creating a new day out of which we will make the best of the lessons of the past . Therefore the things that the Senator believes vital and pertinent from his isolated perspective will not . in all probability , be so regarded by me . His last statement is but a reiteration of what has been said in the Senate time after time , so that If this campaign on the one hand develops into mere morning sessions of the Senate , you will very readily perceive the uselessness of daily response . " This was the first statement made by Governor Cox since his nomination in which ho has permitted himself to be quoted with regard to his attitude on what will he the dominant issue of the campaign . The statement , in addition to shedding light on the attitude he intends to take on the League of Nations covenant and the pence treaty , branded Senator Harding as a reactionary and gave pretty clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal for the progressive vote throughout the country . The Governor believes that this element among the voters will decide the election and regards the record he has made during his three terms as Governor of Ohio as one that will materially strengthen this appeal . Further indication of this purpose was given when Governor Cox was asked in the course of his conference with the newspaper correspondents thin afternoon what he thought would be the effect of the third party now in process of formation . " If the purpose of the third party is merely a disciplinary one I think it its logical to assume that it will visit its vengeance on the party in the majority in States where the various organizations entering into the third party formation sprung from at the time when those organizations first appeared , " was his reply . " Aside from that , I have no doubt that the thought of the country is predominantly and decisively progressive . And I think that progressive voter ; will be intelligently cast whore they will count . " Visited by Life Prisoners . Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system In 0111Q and to introduce humanitarian methods in the treatment of prisoners Today four life prisoners from the Ohio State Penitentiary came to the State House bearing a message from the inmates of that Institution congratulating the Governor on his nomination and wishing him suecese . The four prisoners , who are " trusties " employed in the office of Warden P. E. Thomas , came without a guard after having given their word that they would return . The Governor was not , however , aware of this , and when the spokesman for the four prisoners , a big , upstanding , rather prepossessing fellow , approached him the Governor was not quite certain whether ho had to deal with a man convicted of a crime or an escort sent along to make sure of the return of the prisoners . It took adroit questioning on the part of the Governor before the status of his visitor was established . First the Governor asked him how long ho had been " down there . " " I have been there ten years , " was the reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Governor then asked . " It 's all right . Governor . " the man replied . " The Warden has been very gui ) ( 1 to me . " Then the Governor understood . He explained , after the visit , that it was not the first time , an inmate ' of the penitentiary had called on him ? at his office In the State House . He . said he always made it a point ter have a man on whose behalf a plea for executive clemency had been made brought before him so that he could look him over and question - him . ? But the four life prisoners who called . on him today as bearers of the Message from their fellows , the Governor said , were the first ever let out on a mission Without some one to guard them . " Have you found out whether they got back to the prison ? " one of the correspondents asked the Governor , some time after they had gone . A blank expression fluttered over the Governor 's ? face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to ask , and I suppose I should have done that . 110wever , 1 suppose would have heard if they were missing . I do not know of more than one instance where the word of a prisoner to me was not good . " The spokesman for the prisoners carried the following letter from the Wardal , explaining their mission : Ohio Penitentiary , Columbus , Ohio , July 14 , 1920 . Hon. James M. Cox , Governor of Ohio , Columbus : My Dear Governor : , The attached communication was sent out to me this morning from a committee of- prisoners from the inside of the institution , and I'have decided to send it on to you by a committee of life prisoners who are " trusties " working in the front offices of the institution . I ant sure that whatever consideration is given this communication will be greatly appreciated by the entire inmate body . Yours very truly , .1 ' . E. THOMAS , Warden . Praised for Fairness to Convicts . The message they bore , which was signed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendering congratulations , asked the Governor to " drop in informally , " preferably some Sunday Morning at the chapel service . The Governor has been in the habit of paying such visits from time to time . Here is sit extract from the message : We , who are for the present shut off from the world or the tree , are of times liable to be bitter against those who sit in the high places , but you have always met us on the grounds of human fellowship . Sometimes our . pleas to you have been . rejected , but they have always received consideration , and always have you treated us fairly , and always has your judgment been tempered with mercy . Your life must be an inspiration to all of us , for it shows that in America ' Al things are possible . It proves that , with a right purpose and with the courage to stick to the end , no matter how fate seems against us , a. man can always win . Many times ' have you given to us tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more profit to yourself , and we wish you to know that we appreciate your kindness and the unselfish spirit that has always prompted you . The Governor said he would comply with the request a week from Sunday . As he bade his visitors good-bye he shook each one ? of them by the - hand , with some words of encouragement and cheer . Militant Suffragist a Caller . Among the Governor 's callers today was Mrs. James Rector , a local woman architect and suffragist of the militant type . She came to make arrangements far the conference between Governor Cox and representatives of the Woman 's National Party , composed of militants , which has been scheduled for Friday afternoon prior to the Governor 's departure for Washington . Miss Alice Paul , one of the leaders in this party , is expected here tomorrow in advance of the rest of the delegation . In my opinion , " said Mrs. Rector , " the women will tell the Governor that he must see , to it that the Tennessee Legislature ratifies the Federal suffrage amendment or brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polls in November . No one doubts that Governor Cox has sufficient influence to make the Tennessee lawnmakers do justice to the women if he chooses to bring the necessary pressure to bear . We have confidence in Governor Cox , for he has always been ready to listen to out demands and follow our suggestions . " Republican Makes " Friendly . Visit . ? Governor Cox had a Republican caner this afternoon , Walter F. Brown , former Bull Moose leader in Ohio , now one of three Republican candidates for the nomination for ' United States Senator , to succeed Senator Harding . Governor Cox explained that it was a " friendly visit . " " From my own Observations I should judge that Ohio will go Republican this year , " said Mr. Brown to Tug NEW YORK TIMES eori  --  espondent . " Ohio Is a Republican State . It . went Republican in ISIS . in 1910 it went Democratic because President Wilson managed to keep the country out of war until after the election . " " With peace sentiment so pronounced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely that the Democrats ' platform declaration in favor of a League of Nations that would serve as a preventive against war will make a strong appeal to the voters ? " " That might be true , if your assumption that the Wilson League of Nations would prevent a-ar were sound , " Mr. Brown replied . " But many people here , as elsewhere , look upon it as an incentive to war . The people here are not for the ** brand of League , even though they would like to see this country enter a rational concert of nations , designed to avert wars in the future . " " ' What about the demonstrated votegetting ability of Governor Cox ? " Mr. : Grown was asked . He ' ran 80,000 behind his ticket in 1910 . Harding is very popular with the peters in Ohio . He won by 103,000 the last time he ran . " " But , " he added , " the situation does not hinge On these two men , but on the principles and policies they represent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w ant a change . They have had all they want of mutton and now they want beef . " Drown Does n't Irene Tilled Party . " How will the third party affect the situation in Ohio ? " was asked . " I should say the third party , if it materializes , would draw more heavily from among voters who would be likely to vote for Governor Cot , " Mr. Brown replied . " What the third party stands for will make little appeal- among Republicans , . except in a small group of States where the soil has been prepared by Non-Partisan League propaganda or La Folletteism . . Mr. ? Brown , . who was leader of Colonel Roosevelt 's third party in 1012 , said in reply to a question that the third party of this year would not attract any following among the old Progressives , who almost to a man had returned to the Republican fold . " The election in Ohio this- Fall , " he added , " will be decided by a large and increasing group of voters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unsually large group in Ohio , as witness the frequent fluctuation front ' Republican to Democratic control of the State administration , as well as in the . election of United States Senators and members of the House of Representatives . The influx of industrial workers during the war was held largely responsible in some quarters for the Democratic victory four years ago in Ohio . Mr. Brown said that in his opinion this element did not figure very heavily in the result . . " An analysis of the 1916 vote will show , " he said , " that the Democratic drift was pretty general and extended to non-industrial sections of the State . A majority of the industrial workers did not vote . They were and are an itinerant element in our population . "
