LILY CHRISTINE-The Story of a Good Woman-Michael Arlen-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> On Lily Christine 's pink and black jacket is a subtitle mentioning good woman ; on her title page in pink fast deflowering to purple she nevertheless promises " a romance . " This for Michael Arlen of the onetime vogue is an amalgam so incongruous that one can but suspect him of a publicity trick . The suspicion is confirmed by the old sophisticated sentimentalities of style ill-matched to a heroine , beautiful though near-sighted and bespectacled , passionately devoted to her children though they visit the pages but once , loyal to a faithless husband though she begs one of her many admirers to elope with her . Because she loved him , Lily Christine had married a smart model of English manhood , penniless gambler , cricketer , master of many mistresses . Lily Christine ignored these " pieces of nonsense , " supplied her " old carthorse " husband with a constant friendship , and held the family together . <P> Then suddenly she was confronted , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose virtue was a British household word -a thoroughly wicked woman , grist to the Arlenesque mill . This crafty villainess bewitches the carthorse into cad , and breaks Lily Christine 's heart . Not the least of the heroine 's anguish is over a respectable middle-class boyfriend whom she has unwittingly involved in the scandal . And just as the plot is thickening pleasantly , Lily Christine 's creator pitches her under the wheels of a motor-lorry.
