This paper was not written primarily for publication , but in the opinion of the editor it presents a grave situation which is to-day all too prevalent in the smaller towns of our country . The author , whose name is withheld far obvious reasons , is a prominent and influential citizen of the little mid-Western town which he describes ; his antecedents and present circumstances are accurately set forth , with only such disguising of paper names as has been felt to be necessary IT is to me a real question which for months I have debated and to which I have as yet no answer ; and it is largely in the hope of finding an answer satisfying to a sad and perplexed heart that I here set forth the problem . 11/37 grandfather was a circuit rider , two of my uncles are pastors , my father was a deacon in the church which I still attend , my older sister died in the mission field of Japan . It may be imagined that to one brought up in this tradition the problem of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a trivial one . And by the church I mean the local church into which I was received as a child ? the church in which I have worked and worshiped for more than thirty years , and in which I have held almost every office to which I could be elected=the church which I still attend regularly , and of which I am still a working member . Lest I fall into mere generalities , let me describe somewhat in detail the religious conditions in our little Middle West community . Our first settlers came from Vermont and New Hampshire , and for two generations the little white country churches which they erected at strategic crossroads were filled each Sabbath . Then came the vedettes of foreign immigration , stalwart Scandinavian farm hands , and later their wives . One by one our now prosperous farmers retired and moved into town ; the farms were let out to foreign-born tenants , and then the tenants came to be owners andvastly increased in numbers . To-day more than half our population is Scandinavian . No congregations are left for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the half dozen which lie within a half hour 's drive from our town . Several have been torn down ; others stand vacant and useless ? useless even as warning to a generation of which it may still be said that , having eyes , they see not . The present number of our town churches is six ? to minister to a population of two thousand five hundred . Our cathedral is our Scandinavian church , a really strong organization and , unless all signs fail , destined long to continue strong . Stragglers from that communion have been gathered into one or the other of the English-speaking folds , but the great bulk of the communicants remain faithful to the church of their fatherland . We have a small Catholic church and a small semi-endowed Universalist church , which for thirty years have undergone little change . The remaining three churches are Peniel Church , Nazareth , and my own church of St. Stephen 's . Each contains about a third of the members needed to form a strong church in a town the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than should be commanded by an educated man to-day in any field of work , and each is giving away in benevolences considerably less than 50 per cent of what it spends on current expenses . There are officials in all three organizations who frankly declare that it is so difficult to raise the regular subscriptions that they do not think it wise to stress benevolences . Let the heathen in his blindness stumble on as best he may ; somehow Peniel , Nazareth , and St. Stephen 's must be kept running . Officially and on the surface , relations between the three churches are most cordial ; actually , and for reasons later to be explained , there are heart-burnings . Nazareth 's problems are the most serious ; she has the fewest members and the least wealth , and the fate of the crossroads churches seems for her not far off . Peniel has few wealthy members , but an esprit de corps which goes far to make up for this loss ; work and responsibility are shared in a democratic fashion which promises much for continuing vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most aristocratic of the three churches , and it is true that we have a few more members and certainly more wealth , but some of these well-to-do members have never learned the blessedness of cheerful , liberal giving . Between the last census and the one preceding , our town 's gain in population was forty-eight . I am not quite willing to admit that we are a stagnant community , and yet we are accustomed to see the great majority of our ablest young people remain among us only until they have graduated from high school . There is not the remotest promise of any large increase in the membership of any one of our churches ; as a matter of fact , the membership in all three , owing to deaths and removals , has during the past ten years fallen off al a rmingly . As to our church work , our activities , of course , overlap , and much good effort is wasted . In this respect we are not , I imagine , different from hundreds of other American communities . Taken together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one strong church , and one strong church we ought to be . It requires no expert survey todiagnose our case and to prescribe the remedy ; we should federate , and seven years ago this was attempted under conditions which seemed peculiarly favorable . Nazareth 's " best paying member " had just moved to another state , leaving them in dire financial straits . Their able and energetic young pastor felt strongly the desirability of federation , our pastor heartily seconded him , and both were ready , once the federation was accomplished , to withdraw in favor of some third man who should be pastor of both congregations . The plan had strong supporters in both our churches , and especially was it pushed by Mrs. Talcott , the president of our local Women 's Club , an organization much stronger and much more potent for local betterment than the Ladies ' Aid Society of any one of our churches , or , for that matter , of all of them combined . Mrs. Talcott was a far - visioned woman , energetic and eminently practical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she was a prominent member . She saw clearly that for our churches to continue their separate lines of activity meant lessened efficiency and the early , even if lingering , death of one or more of them . She threw herself with all her influence into the campaign , and the work which she and the pastors and their loyal adherents did was not less tactful than energetic . Their utter failure was , in my opinion , the most tragic calamity that ever befell our local churches . Why did it happen ? Partly from sheer inertia ; things had always been as they were , so they must ever continue , world without end . Partly it was a pathetic lack of constructive imagination ; not being able to foresee in all its details just what a federation would do and be , and being unable to secure from the advocates of the plan a complete and illustrated prospectus , some would have no part or lot in the matter , not so much as to vote for the appointment of a committee to formulate tentative plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ure was- due to causes which would not bear the light of day ; old bickerings and jealousies that had for years festered and fermented , one or two ancient scandals ; and then the question of who , if the federation were consummated , would play the pipe organ , who would lead the choir , and would there be one ladies ' society or two ? To all of these elements there was added ? for us of St. Stephen 's ? the illuminating and eminently practical suggestion : Why federate when Nazareth was so plainly upon her death bed ? What profit in being generous , or even compromising ? Had not the Lord delivered Nazareth Bound into our hand ? We had but to wait until the demise occurred and then enter in and gather up the spoils . This was a course of reasoning so irritating to Nazareth that , in mere spite , as it seemed to some of our members , she decided not to die , or ; hat if she did die she would at least see : o it that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscripions , reconciled a few recalcitrant nembers , held a revival with the help of one or two pastors from out of town , nd brought in a few new members . Co-day , were our two best-paying mem'ers to move away , her condition would oe sounder than ours . But the victory of the antifederationits had cost us something . There was o " row " ? the federationists were good ) sers and went back to their respective lsks ? but Mrs. Talcott and some others ave lost a certain keenness of interest in ieir church work . Within a year fazareth lost her pastor and we lost ars , and we have found no men of their diber to replace them . We might march and find such ( I say might , for in lese days few able pastors are seeking nv fields , and we have by no means creased salaries in proportion to the creased cost of living ) , but , even if we ould find him , I have grave doubts Nether we ought to claim him . If a an who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of St. Stephen 's : VOL . CXLII. ? No. 849. - 44 " I want to put my life where it will count most . Ought I to come to your church ? " I , to be conscientious , would have to reply : " No ; there are a thousand fields needing such ministrations as yours far more than we need them , and yielding you a richer harvest . To place you here would be like placing an able merchant in charge of a popcorn stand . " Let me describe the men who now serve our three churches . Our pastor , the Rev. Hiram Holt , has an unblemished reputation , an imposing personal appearance , a dignity of manner , and a fatal sufficiency of words . He can at a moment 's notice speak fluently and extendedly " on any topic , " as admiring parishoners have been known to say . His theology I am at loss to describe . He is certainly not , like myself , a religious insurgent ; he is not a progressive , yet he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined in theological matters to be all things to all men , to play safe , avoid controversy , give no offense ; and so , Sunday after Sunday , he rephrases for us ? and only slightly rephrases ? religious platitudes as familiar and as indisputable , and for the most part as vapid and uninspiring , as the multiplication table . He is not gifted with imagination or with the literary sense ; he is no student , no reader of either the classics or current literature . That boundless friendliness and that keenness of interest in all life which have been the supreme gifts of so many religious leaders ? these Mr. Holt has not . " As I grow older I find I am growing tired , " said one of the sweetest-spirited men I ever knew , " of reading articles and hearing sermons that are made up of just general language . " And such are the sermons of Mr. Holt ? always dignified , grammatical , rarely ludicrous , but never accurately informing , and never inspired by passionate conviction . They are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peniel , is a different type . The son of one of John Brown 's raiders , he remains rigidly faithful to " the old-time religion . " To accept Brother Elton 's teaching is to face both the New Testament and the Old from the standpoint of absolute , unwavering credulity ? the ax swam . for Elisha ; the shadow moved backward on FIezekiah 's dial ; the outspread fleece of Gideon was alternately wet and dry ; and the prophet Jonah sojourned three days in the belly of the great fish . I have sometimes wondered whether Brother Elton also believes that for Joshua the sun and moon of Copernican astronomy actually stood still , and whether the visible universe was created in six days of twenty-four hours each ; but all I can be sure of is that Brother Elton would be deeply hurt were anyone to ask him . Unconsciously and , I believe , out of real reverence , he has come to apply to religion the advice which a modern novelist puts in the mouth of one of his characters , " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't try to answer ' era ! " To Brother Elton any form of new theology is anathema , and the higher criticism is anti-Christ . Need I add that he is an old man ? In his time he did good , heroic work , this soldier of the Cross , but were he a soldier of Uncle Sam , military efficiency would long ago have placed him upon the retired list ; no one would dream of entrusting him with the command of a regiment , even in peace times . Still hale of body , his mind is impervious to new truth . His was a meager and hard-won education in a college which even in that day was viewed as narrow ; and Brother Elton has never broadened , never grown . To his younger hearers he is as one who speaks an unknown tongue . Yet who shall go to this man , grown gray in service , and tell him ? One must be calloused indeed , or inspired by the loftiest sense of duty . In certain moods I admire Brother Elton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than bring to him the cruel truth . For , be it remembered , there is no regular tenure of office . When our school board each year assumesoffice , its first task is to elect , or reelect a superintendent of schools , but no such businesslike system prevails in our churches . The pastor is not re-engaged each year ; he simply stays on until he receives a more tempting " call , " or until it is intimated to him , officially or otherwise , that the church covets his resignation . The only method of retiring Brother Elton would be , as a high-school boy of his congregation suggested , to " treat him rough . " Nazareth receives at present the ministrations of a student pastor who spends in Bristol but three days out of the seven . The Rev. Percy Smith takes himself with extreme seriousness and confidently anticipates a distingaiishei career . He has a cherubic countenance declamatory gifts which , unfortunately he has been told would have won install acclaim upon the stage , a sentiments turn of mind , and an impulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the more sedate member of his congregation . Of indifferen scholarship , both in high school and i the seminary , he would yet hold it point of honor never to admit uncei tainty regarding any question of theo ogy which might be propounded to hin But he is young , and to youth inol parishes are indulgent . To no one of these men does our con community look for any real leadership , eve religious leadership , and yet I would t no means imply that in our churches r work of any real value is being done . l my own church we have a good Suncs school , community approval of which shown by the fact that it is regular attended by the children of parents wl themselves never are seen at church These children attend until they begin feel grown up , when they run true parental type . We have just now exceptional choir leader , and this you-woman is giving to our young people the advantages of an excellent amate choral society . Our Ladies ' Aid Sociei like most such organizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rgy , but its by-products of sociability and friendliness make it a really efficient 3ody . We serve as a feeder to a number 3f denominational societies which are loing worthy work . Most , not by any means all , of the ) est people of Bristol are in one or the ) ther of our churches ; but if the work d the church be " to make bad people ; ood and to make good people better , " air churches are doing it only in a oundabout fashion and with most inLifferent success . " Bad people " we , as church , hardly reach save at third or ourth hand , through our contributions o missionary societies ; and we certainly 7ould never think of going out personlly to seek them in the highways and oolrooms . Some " good people " we re to my mind making , not better , but ? ally worse , for is there a more danger-us or insidious sentiment to instill into good man 's heart than a feeling of itisfaction with his own goodness ? ? a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having - ) stained from the grosser forms of Liquity like profane swearing and attnding Sunday baseball games , there-.re he has done all that could be deanded of him by an exacting Deity ? is , I fear , seldom that any of our lurch people deny themselves a theater arty , or a new automobile , or give to Ly good cause " until it hurts . " I have said that not all the good peoe of Bristol are connected with our Lurches . Time was when one must Cher have some " church affiliation " or a marked man , but that day has ssed . An influential and increasing oup of our young college people , eminent in every movement for civic tterinent , have practically no connecrn with our churches . None of them hostile , some of them express a vastand , I think , genuine longing to find the church the joy and inspiration Hr fathers found there . They would Lily like to help , but they are kept of by the fact that they find in our ? vices so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their prevailing opinion seems to be that our churches , while deserving of respect because of their intentions and their venerable history , really belong to a past order of things and represent an outworn type of machinery for social regeneration . Upon the financial help of this group , I might add , we can always count whenever we attempt anything really big . The fact that they and some of the teachers in our publir schools neither do church work nor attend church , is to some of our members a matter not of regret only , but of scandal , attributable to one or both of two causes ? the demoralizing influence of higher education and a lack of cordiality upon the part of church members . Further than this , they refuse to admit any blame on our part . Yet when Mr. Holt , in his best professional manner , urges that we invite others to attend service , I do not do it . How can I and be honest ? Those to whom I have referred would not be intellectually , or morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Holt preaches . Harsh as it may sound , I believe that they would find his words bearing far less resemblance to the Bread of Life than to the husks of the far-wandering prodigal . What certain orthodox readers may wish to tell me I can imagine : " Let this complaining brother stop picking flaws and go to work . That will cure him of his jeremiads . " To which I answer , as boldly as did St. Paul , that so far at least as St. Stephen 's is concerned , I have labored not perhaps more abundantly than they all , but I am doing as much church work as any member of the congregation , and what I am doing is not done grudgingly . Much of it I enjoy , but I can not shut my eyes to the fact that there is also much of it which does no more than help to keep the wheels of the ecclesiastical machinery languidly turning . I am not disgruntled with any of my associates ; I am not soured by any personal slight , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely personal aspect of our church problem . Some months ago we had attended a union meeting at which Brother Elton preached . In his sermon he had reviled some of the greatest names of science , ridiculed ? even while he showed that he knew almost nothing about them ? some of the most profound and illuminating books of modern Biblical criticism , and in the name of Jesus and in the cracked voice of senility poured out threutenings and damnation against some of the greatest of our living spiritual leaders . It was on our way home that Brainerd , my oldest boy , a senior in high school , broke a long silence to exclaim , " Dad , it 's too bad to let a man take anything as splendid as religion and talk about it so that you just have to laugh at it . " That is my personal complaint against our three churches . I want my sons to love and respect the church , but I have ceased to regard it as of supreme importance that they should do so . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to go to . Clayton , my twelve-year-old , vculd probably never have put the ma -r in the terms Brainerd used , but he has as little enthusiasm as his brother for our church services , nor could I respect intellectually my sons if they did enjoy Mr. Holt 's sermons . They can not remember a time when they did not attend church ; they attend still , although with increasing reluctance , because their mother and I hold that church attendance is a part of decent living . But regular , enforced attendance upon such services as ours is not going to make them love the church . What chiefly concerns me is their religion . How , I sometimes wonder , will that be affected when Sunday after Sunday they continue to hear it talked about in such a fashion that " you just ca n't help laughing at it " ? There are two lesser counts in my personal indictment , and one of these is money . To-day 's demands upon the generous are almost incessant , becauseto-day the world 's need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wealthy , have given away a tenth of my income and now a full third of my total benevolence budget goes toward the runnir4 expenses of an institution Lhe value which to any but a small fraction of can community I gravely doubt . Anc money is to-day worth so much , it Armenia and Poland and China ! The second count is time . I am busy man , spending nine hours of ever week day in work remote from life ' , higher problems ; and I long , sometime passionately , for the Sabbath uplift am inspiration that some men 's sermon have brought me . Something akin b this inspiration I could get from book on my shelves , and , armed with thei faith and courage , go back to put mor real religion into my week days . Hui instead of reading these books , I atten church . Three hours a week ? four , if go to the midweek prayer meeting ? spend in religious services that do nc help me religiously . What can I do about it ? I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church and figl for federation . In federation alone Iii the hope of our ever being really efl cient , the hope of our ever securing ? ( deserving ? an able leader . But to brir about federation after the failure seven years ago is the task of a dipl matic saint , and upon him it would mal large demands . Irrevocably it was d feated , and nothing but dire necessil will ever bring it again to the for Blessed be whatever calamity brill ; that to pass ! Or I can try to tell ray fellow membe something of what I have here set fort I can withdraw from active particip tion in church work , and transfer n church subscription to the work of o denominational boards . Sometimes has seemed to me that , believing as I d this is the only honest course for me take . But in large measure our church represent the vested respectability our community ; to old , to lifelo friends I should become near to a heathen man and a publican . They would never understand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence I have in the community . Or I can become a Laodicean ? a method already extremely popular with many church members . I can deliberately , but not too rapidly , degrade church activity to a position of seventh or eighth interest in my life . I can attend less and less regularly ; T can contribute enough to stifle protests and no more . When it comes to any matter of real responsibility , I can shirk it . I can be a drone and a slacker , yet not so as to bring upon myself censure and dismissal . But against a course so pusillanimous all that is decent and manly within me revolts . What , then , shall I do ? I am not pessimistic . I have no fears for the fate of religion in the world . I believe that there is more dynamic religion among us to-day than there ever was before . The spirit of the Christ , if his church fails to express it , will find for itself some fitter incarnation . And yet I do not despair even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bristol , there may come , I pray , a renaissance ; and in that rebirth I would fain be a helper .
