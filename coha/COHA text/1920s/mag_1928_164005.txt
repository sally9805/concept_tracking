Seven snake eggs lay for seventy-seven years , sealed in a tree in Tullahoma , Tenn . Strong men came and split the tree , exposing an iron spike of the kind first used in the construction of the Nashville , Chattanooga &; St. Louis Railroad in 1851 . Around the spike was a decayed hole about five inches long , in which lay the tough , rubbery snake eggs . Having the good of Tullahoma at heart , down to the lowest snake , Mayor W. J. Davidson took the eggs to his heated office and gave them a place in the sun , atop his desk . Last week he noticed the box vibrating . He looked into it and found seven infant snakes crawling about , frisky and healthy after an incubation period of seventy-seven years . The seventy-seven years were calculated from the hand forged spike and by the rings of the tree .
