There follows a summary of discoveries in archeology and paleontology since last recorded in TIME ( Dec. 31 , Jan. 7 ) . <P> United States . The greatest sensation of the year in human fossils came to light on the Rancho Cunajo , near Los Angeles , Calif . A construction company , building a sewer , turned up a petrified skull and bone fragments of five human frames in a sand pit 23 feet below the surface . The strata are of the Pleistocene age , antedating the last great ice age , which ended at least 15,000 to 20,000 years ago . Several trained scientists happened to be near , including Dr. John C. Merriam , President of the Carnegie Institution ; Dr. Robert T. Hill , geologist ; Dr. William A. Bryan , Director of the Los Angeles Museum ; Dr. Chester Stock , of the department of paleontology , University of California . Their reports seem to indicate that the remains are not only the oldest of the prehistoric man in America , but that they belong to the " true men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Cro-Magnon race of Western Europe , 20,000 to 50,000 years ago , whom Henry Fairfield Osborn declares to have been the mental equals of college men of today . The Los Angeles finds , named the Haverty group in honor of the Irish contractor who found them , have brain cases as large as modern men ; their last molar ( " wisdom " ) teeth are underdeveloped as in civilized men ; their stature was extraordinary , reaching seven feet in height . <P> It has long been held with fair unanimity among scientists , that the birthplace of genuine man was probably in southeastern Asia , or somewhere on a belt stretching northwest to England . No traces of really ancient humans had been found in America , and the Western Hemisphere was believed to have been uninhabited by men until people from Asia , over the Bering Strait , by Mongoloid stock , ancestors of the Eskimo and Indians . Many supposedly ice-age human remains in the U. S. , when closely investigated , have turned out to be comparatively recent Indians . This is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch , near Santa Barbara , Calif . Dr. Ales Hrdlicka , of the Smithsonian Institution , recently punctured all discoveries hitherto as not more than 5,000 years old . A human deposit of the late glacial period , found near Trenton , N. J. , however , is considered genuine by many paleontologists . Dr. Hill and his colleagues are men of excellent standing . The location of the fossils might be due to slides of more recent strata , but Dr. Hill says there is no possibility of such geologic intrusion there , as there was at Santa Barbara . Drs . F. W. Hodge , W. K. Gregory and Clark Wissler , leading anthropologists and paleontologists of New York , are inclined to give credence ito the reports . If , therefore , further investigation confirms them , much of our present knowledge of prehistoric man will have to be rewritten . <P> In Fresno County , Calif. , remains of a tribe of Indians were discovered , the shape and condition of whose teeth indicated that they were vegetarians , living on grass and herbs . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho , a skeleton of a woman more than eight feet in height was discovered in a cliff . This also seemed to belong to an herbivorous race . Scientists are reserved in their judgment until it has been examined by Smithsonian experts .
