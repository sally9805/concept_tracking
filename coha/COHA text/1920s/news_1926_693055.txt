txt Jeddu Krishnamurti , hailed by Theosophists as the new " Vehicle for the World Teacher , " or the new " Messiah , " spoke yesterday unsupported by Dr. Annie Besant , his sponsor , for the first time since he arrived in this country . He met forty reporters in the assembly room of the Waldorf . Many of them tried to trip him with carefully worded questions , but he avoided all difficulties and easily came out triumphant . He was no longer the shy , badly frightened young man of his trip up the harbor . Instead , he faced his interrogators with confidence and spoke with an air of authority . He seemed ten years older . More than once his voice , normally soft and cultured , for he speaks with an Oxford accent , took on tone and austerity as he rebuked those who put what he considered foolish questions , and replied with questions of his own . This was particularly true when he replied to a question as to what was his criticism of America . " You fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You are a wonderful country and you think you are happy , but you are deluded . You buy pictures , but you do n't know what they are . You use long words , but you do n't know what their meaning is , or else you think that , if you have a phrase for anything , you have described it forever . You have radios and phonographs and mechanical pianos , but music means nothing to your souls . " Concerning his own life Krishnamurti was less willing to be outspoken . " It does n't seem important , " he said . Answers All Questions . He was finally persuaded to answer all questions , whether personal or not . " Why did you travel first class instead of second class or even third class ? " was one question . " Because I have been brought up in a peculiar manner , " he replied . " You know , in India our bodies are more sensitive than here . And I must have at least cleanliness and quietness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough of it . " " Then you do n't believe in Christ 's instructions , ' Lay not up for yourself treasure here on earth ' ? " " Yes . I believe in them . I do n't want to lay up treasures here en earth . I do n't want millions in the bank . That is n't happiness . If I could n't have a new suit tomorrow I would n't be unhappy , but that does n't mean that it is a sin to have a suit when I can . " Asked to explain his philosophy in a phrase , Krishnamurti said that he preached " via media . " " In India the spirit is too much , " he said , " and the physical is neglected . For instance , science is ignored and disease is not properly combated , In America the opposite is true . You stress the physical world with its comfort and luxury . Your first consideration is to get enough for every dollar you spend . This is equally wrong . I seek a balance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you feel that you have a mis-sion ? " " Naturally , if a man has found happiness he wants to snare it with others . " " But how do you know we are n't happy ? " e ' You ca n't be . You are n't interested in the things that bring happiness . Take any ordinary person . What is he interested in ? Money ? Is that permanent ? Jazz ? Is that permanent ? A good time ? " Some of the questions were designed to induce Krisbnamurti to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and his own life . One woman reporter kept interrupting him with questions along this line . Finally the young Hindu became angry . " Why do you who are ignorant keep questioning me in this manner ? " he asked . " You said Jesus did this thing and that thing . How do you know He did ? Did you see Him ? The most that you can say is that it is written that Christ did these things ; it is reported so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioners was how be felt when the World Teacher took possession of his body . On this point he gave very little enlightenment . " I ca n't really tell you , " he said . " I do n't like to speak of these things . I feel kindly and affectionate toward all things . I feel at unity with everything . " He was asked about his vegetarian diet . " In the first place it Is a matter of principle , " he explained . " I do n't believe . in eating anything that has lived . In the second plat. it is a matter of health . You ca n't eat meat in India . For that reason a vegetarian diet is a matter for thought . If you want to be healthy it must be carefully balanced and made of ' four parts . First , starch , such as rice or macaroni ; second , ' protein ? third , vegetables , and fourth , the juice of fruit . " Krishnamurti also was questioned in regard to his social and political opinions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have tendencies in that direction , " he replied . " Certainly , I do n't believe in the private ownership of beautiful things such as works of art . But do n't quote me as against all private ownership . " " Are you a Bolshevik ? " " I do n't know very much about Bolshevism . " The last question put to him was : " Do you believe in prohibition ? " He replied very emphatically , " I do . " Three hundred members of the National Theosophist Society held an informal meeting last night at the Princess Theatre . Sixth Avenue and Thirty-ninth Street ,
