When the bogus Knights of Columbus fourth degree oath ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) was being circulated , in the heat of the anti-Catholic persecutions last fall , the Knights themselves took various steps to check it . They freely published the true oath . They offered $25,000 to anyone who could prove the bogus oath was used . <P> These measures failing , the Knights agreed to prosecute certain men and organizations responsible . Last week two actions for criminal libel resulted in the conviction of a Savannah evangelist and the indictment of a Christian minister in New Jersey . <P> <P> Only the plea of the ' jury which convicted him saved Rev. W. F. Larowe , in Savannah , from doing three months in jail . He was put on probation . The prosecuting attorney called the court 's attention to the fact that , since his arrest , the minister had already spent some time behind bars . The jury recommended " extreme mercy . " <P> In Newark the grand jury indicted Rev. Elmo L. Bateman , pastor of the First Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Knights of Columbus and Edward J. O'Brien , master of the Fourth Degree of the First Division , New Jersey Knights of Columbus . It is charged that Mr. Bateman printed pamphlets containing the oath , on a press in the basement of his home . <P> Officers of Mr. Bateman 's church informed the prosecutor that they had not supported him in such activities . <P> According to the bogus oath , candidates were said to vow merciless war against heretics , Protestants , Masons . On the Sunday following his indictment Bateman . at the request of the board of trustees , tendered his resignation as pastor .
