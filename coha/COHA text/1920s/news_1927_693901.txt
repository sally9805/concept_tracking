txt Will Rogers Visualizes Flood Victims ' Home-Coming SPRINGFIELD , Mo. , June 3 . ? On my way home to Oklahoma . What 's happier , especially if people have forgot what you used to be ? Flew over hundreds of miles yesterday and saw the advance guard of 700,000 people returning home . Home to what ? To a great , big , flat mud-hole . No houses , no barns , no fences , no plows , no seed , no work , no stock , no stoves . What a home-coming ! Also yesterday received personal telegram from John Barton Payne , the head of the Red Cross , America 's great possession . in which he made this amazing statement : " We are still a million and a half short of our quota . " Remember that there has been a new quota set for you in the last week , so get busy . What did we rescue them for ? So they would have the pleasure of starving later ?
