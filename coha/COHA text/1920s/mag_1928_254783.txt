Freemason George Washington dreamed of a University of the U. S. A. , at Washington . Last week the Supreme Council , Scottish Rite Masons gave $1,000,000 to George Washington University to found a school of government at the seat of government . <P> Resolved to die poor , Publisher George G. Booth , son-in-law of the late James Edmund Scripps , newspaper owner , added $6,500,000 to the $5,000,000 he and his wife have already given to complete Cranbrook Foundation- " cultural centre " of five schools and a church-on his estate in northern Michigan ( Bloomfield Hills ) . A children 's school and a boy 's school , already open , will be followed by a school for girls . They will finally prepare for college , or encourage the talented to enter the school of arts and crafts and the academy of art , yet to be founded . Artists and craftsmen of high repute-Eliel Saarinen , , Finnish architect , Geza Maroti , Hungarian sculptor-will instruct apprentices , form a colony . <P> Three thousand money seekers , passing the plate to 21,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the drive ended with December 's end the amount was oversubscribed-just how much no one knew , as late subscriptions swept in by letter and cable . <P> New York City subscribed more than half the fund-$12,070,783 ; Chicago came next with $1,416,976 ; New Haven third with $766,970 . Yale students subscribed $260,142 ; Alumnus William Howard Taft , $10,000 . The drive drew donors from classes ranging over nearly a century , from 1853 to a twelve-year-old who aspires to join the class of 1938 ; included graduates of Harvard , Princeton , Colgate . <P> Gifts of the largest ten subscribers totaled $6,450,000 . Chief among them was Edward Stephen Harkness ( 1897 ) , who supplemented his fat subscription with a special gift of cover charges for the whole campaign cost . But for him , said President Angell , the drive would have failed its schedule dates . <P> From the fund Yale will receive a yearly $1,000,000 . A million for improvement and not one cent for expansion .               @ @ @ @ @ @
