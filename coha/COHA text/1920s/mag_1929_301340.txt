For the sixth time in a twelvemonth , Japanese were perturbed , last week , at the recurrence of an awful but now chronic scandal : personal appeal by a mere subject to the Divine Emperor . <P> Since His Majesty is the 124th lineal descendant of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu-0-Mikami , such appeals are regarded as a deadly sacrilege and sin . Nonetheless last week , when Emperor Hirohito rode out to open Parliament , a burly farmer from Saitama Province burst through the cordon of Imperial police and groveled sinfully before the Son of Heaven . <P> " The floods ! " cried the farmer . " Save us from the waters , Divine One ! The floods are rising in Saitama . Save our farms ! Speak only a word to Amaterasu-0-Mikami , that She may dry up the floods ! " <P> As the simple , believing rustic was dragged away , the " Son of Heaven " looked down compassionately through spectacles , from his great Louis XIV State Coach . Above the gorgeous vehicle a golden phoenix perched with wings spread-symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spectacles really believes that he can talk with his Divine Ancestress Amaterasu-0-Mikami-as he is supposed to do several times a year-the farmer 's plea must have stirred in His Majesty strange emotions . <P> Presently , as the State Coach clattered into Parliament Square and drew up , Emperor Hirohito stepped nimbly down , as though nothing had happened , and was received by members of the Kizokuin ( House of Peers ) and the Shugiin ( Commons ) , standing at stiff attention in the open air . Soon , beneath the vault of Heaven , the Son of Heaven pronounced in high , piercing , rapid syllables the traditional Four Sentences , opening Parliament . <P> Though varied slightly , as occasion demands , the Four Sentences are always to the effect that His Majesty 's relations with the Powers are friendly ( as at present ) or otherwise ; that the budget must be voted ; and that Peers and Commons should " exercise care and consideration for the welfare of the Empire . " <P> Political Situation . When members of the present Parliament were elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prime Minister General Baron Giichi Tanaka could count upon only 221 seats . The Government was therefore menaced with upset by the Minseito opposition of 214 , plus a faction holding the balance of power led by Deputy Yusuke Tsurumi . That the Cabinet was not immediately overthrown , was due to the adjournment of Parliament for the solemn enthronement of the Emperor Hirohito . <P> During this ceremonious interval , Baron Tanaka has unquestionably played politics with bribes and blandishments . The result appeared to be , last week , that Deputy Yusuke Tsurumi and his balance-of-power faction are now heart and soul for the Prime Minister . Furthermore moneyed Baron Tanaka has persuaded 29 of the Minseito opposition Deputies to bolt their party under Takejiro Tokonami and set themselves up as soi-disant independents . This reduces the effective strength of the Minseito opposition to 185 , making certain supremacy for the Prime Minister .
