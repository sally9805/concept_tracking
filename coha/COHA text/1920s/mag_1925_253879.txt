For many years , the insurance business in New York State has been increasingly regulated by the state . Ever since the famed insurance investigation of 1906 , during which Charles E. Hughes established his reputation in public life , the statutory control has been searching and severe . U. S. insurance companies have been supervised , not only in the kinds of insurance they offered and their methods in so doing , but also in the kind of investments they could hold . <P> Meanwhile , the old firm of Lloyd 's in London has done a very large business in the U. S. Lloyd 's , world-famous for its marine insurance facilities , has also been accustomed to take all species of risks . In one well-known policy , it insured a gentleman against having twins . The result has been that , in this country , Lloyd 's has been able to take much business that a state-regulated U. S. company could not accept . <P> This has at length stirred up opposition . Some of the U. S. companies have demanded that Lloyd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same conditions in the business by which they themselves have been bound . Also , the State Superintendent of Insurance , James A. Beha , last week declared that , in the case of disputed claims , U. S. citizens were not adequately protected and had no way of bringing pressure to bear in London in behalf of their interests .
