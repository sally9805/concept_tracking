COMMONWEALTH ( British Commonwealth of Nations ) <P> To recall the populations of India* and of Great Britain+ is to wonder how much longer the meek colossus will bear the proud pygmy 's yoke . As yet the sole , authentic voice articulating India 's slumbrous discontent is that of the Indian National Congress . Last week its delegates met , 5000 strong , in the huge , sprawling , unlovely city of Madras , on India 's southeast coast . <P> Came folk representing each Indian caste , rank , race and sect , nearly all clad in symbolical , white homespun robes . Standard bearers unfurled everywhere the national banner : red , green &; white , with a spinning wheel in the center . If only all Indians would follow these banners , if only each would spin at home what cloth he needs , if only Indians would buy nothing from Great Britain , then " the nation of shopkeepers " ( England ) would be choked by its own surplus- at least so believes the Indian National Congress . <P> To Anglo-Saxons a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still seem the great Indian combatants . They talk not of howitzers nor of horse power but rather of how to evoke from teeming millions a cumulative " soul thrust " which shall rock the world . One and all they defer to the Mahatma : " the Great Soul " : Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi . <P> Last week Mahatma Gandhi received general homage as he squatted upon his usual dais , naked except for his habitual skimpy loin cloth , emaciated from much fasting and prayer , and wearing as his sole adornment a cheap nickel-plated watch suspended by a cord from his scrawny neck . <P> Around the Mahatma a " soul thrust " proceeded to generate itself . As he spoke-in precise English or soaring Hindustani-the Congress beheld a vision , grasped at a vast surmise . His were the grand , the eternal themes : 1 ) Union transcending caste , race , creed ; 2 ) PASSIVE RESISTANCE , the sword which shall slay the mightiest in the end ; 3 ) SPINNING WHEELS , more and yet more of them , more and yet more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahatma now leaves active political leadership to others , remaining their spiritual leader , he was not , as he has been , the President of the Congress . That role fell to a Mohammedan , potent Hakim Ajmal Khan . Under his chairmanship the delegates discussed in wrathful mood the appointment of the British Statutory Commission ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) which will shortly go out to India to study and recommend practicable means of extending to Indians greater political freedom . Because not one single Indian will sit on this Commission , the 5000 delegates at Madras declared by unanimous resolution , last week , that all Indians must boycott it . General discussion then began and promised to continue for some weeks . <P> What the Secretary of State for India thinks of the Indian National Congress was shrewdly guessed at by the Indian journal Bengalee , last week , when it reproached Secretary Lord Birkenhead with having " a contempt for all Indians , which , though silent , is intense and real .
