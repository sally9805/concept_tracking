txt H. F. Sinclair , chairman of tIte board . of Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corp. , denies circulated reports of impending new financing and additional bank borrowings by the company . He says : " None of these reports are true . The Sinclair-.corporation , contemplates no new financing and there has been no discussion of any new financing by either directors or the finance committee . In the normal course of our operations the accumulation of inventories is usual at this season of the year and in this connection we have used some of our bank lines for reasonable loans . Those loans have probably passed their peak , as we are already reducing our inventories because of increasing sales , and from this time on we should reduce bank loans steadily . " The financial budget of the corporation for 1924 was carefully considered by the finance committee and board of directors , and unless some unforeseen development occurs in the petroleum industry no change in dividend pOlicy need be suggested , as earnings during the first four months of the year have exceeded the estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We belies e that since March the consumption of Crude oil in the United States has exceeded production . This excess of consumption over available supplies of raw material will almost certainly become more pronounced each week from now on . When considering crude production and crude stocks on hand the public must remember that it is light crude oil from which gasoline is principally produced and that the supply of this light crude is steadily diminishing . Total production figures will be misleading if this fact is not taken fully into account . "
