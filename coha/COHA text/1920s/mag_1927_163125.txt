John Daniel Hertz of Chicago , who stirred up a new demand for motor cars by permitting people who rented his machines by the mile or hour to drive the machines themselves ( Driv-ur-Self TIME , June 21 , 1926 ) last week extended the idea to motor trucks . The Yellow Truck &; Coach Mfg . Co. , General Motors subsidiary which he heads , now rents one-ton trucks to people who need a light truck either occasionally or for some emergency . In Chicago the Driv-ur-Self truck rates are 22c to 25c a mile and $7.50 to $8.50 a day .
