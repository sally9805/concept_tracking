THE OLD AND THE YOUNG-Luigi Pirandello-Button ( $5.00 ) . <P> Dramatis Personae . Sicily being a time-honored battleground for radicals and conservatives , its " typical inhabitants " of the ' gos were legion . Not to neglect the least of these , Pirandello has recreated every conceivable type , but luckily his elaborate personnel sorts itself out into groups , and a few unforgettables single themselves out from the groups . <P> Dominating group , divided against itself , is the Laurentano family , old and young : Don Cosmo , madman or philosopher , is a kindly recluse on the family estate and with him lives Mauro Mortora , an old fanatic Garibaldino . Disgusted with these revolutionists of 1860 another Laurentano , Prince Ippolito , had banished himself for life to a neighboring estate , and manned it with a guard dressed in conspicuously gaudy Bourbon uniform , the joke of the countryside . But his son , Lando , lived luxuriously in Rome , and published , out of boredom , a socialist paper which sympathized from safe distance with laborers in Sicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions called fasci , nevertheless persuaded Lando , against his better cynical judgment , to come to Sicily and co-ordinate revolt . <P> Lando 's resultant activities were most distressing to another family group , headed by Salvo , a wealthy social climber , who prospered on unscrupulous control of Sicilian sulphur mines . Salvo had an insane wife , a jovial old-maid sister , and an invalid daughter , Dianella , of delicate charm . Having married off the old maid , sight unseen , to the prince , Lando 's widowed father , Salvo , aspired to bind himself yet closer to the aristocratic Laurentanos by marrying Dianella to Lando . <P> But in this matter there were still others to reckon with . Aurelio , son of a sulphur miner , had once saved Salvo from a ludicrous death , whereupon Salvo generously awarded the boy with education , and a position as foreman of sulphur mines . Influenced somewhat by her father 's high opinion of Aurelio , Dianella fell glowingly in love with the youth . Meanwhile , what with strikes and lockouts at the mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon the project of marrying the girl to Lando Laurentano and to give her instead to Aurelio , if that young man could quell the uprising of laborers . But the insensate miners greeted the representative of their inexorable master with knives and firebrands , and when Dianella heard that Aurelio ( and a lady-friend ) had been gashed and burned alive she went mad . <P> The affair reacted upon the Laurentano family in intricate fashion . The prince 's vulgar bride eloped with the widower of the murdered lady-friend . Lando barely escaped the island where he had abetted the riots . Sicily was put under martial law , and the old Garibaldino Mauro , frenzied by the impertinence of upstart socialists , fared forth with his medals and pistols of 1860 to assist the state troopers . These unimaginative souls mistook him for a rioter , and shot him in a street fight .
