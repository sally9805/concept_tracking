The tops of the shop windows are just above the level of the street , and through them we see the procession of shoes , any one of them a novel or a play or a poem . In the workshop one finds not only medals and salad forks for prelates , but unexpected things , a viola d'amore and folios ruled for music . Tullio enters from the street and confronts his master , Charles of Benicet . Tullio stands with his back to the door and lets his breath out slowly , as one who has just accomplished a great work . CHARLES ( Rubbing his hands ) : So you delivered the rings ? TULLIO Yes , master . CHARLES And what did my little brown Jacquenetta say ? TULLIO She twice read the verse you had written in the ring . Then she looked at me . Then she looked at the ring . " It is too cold , " she said . CHARLES Too cold ? TULLIO She said : " But but I suppose it 's what must go inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell you she loved it . CHARLES ( Arrested and puzzled ) : Too cold , the verse !  --  But I 'll make her another . We forget how they love us . And the other ring ? Did you deliver the Graf 's ring to the Lady Jehanne herself ? p. 3 TULLIO Yes , master . Into her very own hand . Her house is very old and in a bad part of the city . As I crossed the court and stood in the hall a great German , with fierce eyebrows , came in from the street with me . CHARLES Yes , that 's the one she 's to marry . TULLIO He asked me loudly what I had there . And I said , a box for the Lady Jehanne , and that it was for her hand alone , and I ran to the landing on the stairs . Then she came out herself . He cried out upon her : What gift was she receiving ? And was it from a certain English student at Padua ? And she said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have sent me . " And when I gave it to her she went in , very white , and without speaking to him . Then I went to Jacquenetta 's with the other ring , and she gave me some supper . CHARLES Too cold , the verse ! Start putting up the shutters ; I must go and see her . ( It has been growing darker . Suddenly a pair of shoes , a poem these , descends from the crowd , and Tullio opens the door to a knock . A beautiful lady gives Christian greeting , and a seat is made for her among the littered chairs . She sits in silence until Tullio has lighted the candles and retired . ) JEHANNE You are Charles of Benicet , master in precious metals ? CHARLES Carolus Benizentius auro argentoque magister , and composer of music to God and to such men whose ears He chooses to open . p. 4 JEHANNE You are a composer too ? CHARLES They are callings like two sisters who have ever their arms about the other 's neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motet thereto . The boy who calls to see if the candlesticks are done takes back with him a Mass . JEHANNE ( Without a breath ) : Oh ! CHARLES Can I serve you with music or with metals ? JEHANNE You have served me today . I am the Lady Jehanne . CHARLES Ah , yes ! The ring was unsatisfactory ? I can make another tonight . I shall set about it at once . JEHANNE No , master . The ring is very beautiful . CHARLES ( After a pause , pretending to be embarrassed ) : I am overjoyed that it pleases you . JEHANNE ( Suddenly ) : The verses that you put in the rings  --  where do you find them ? CHARLES Unless there is a special request , my lady , I put in nothing but the traditional legend : fidelitas carior vita . JEHANNE ( Without reproach ) : But there are liberties you allow yourself ? Master , what meant you when you wrote within my ring ? p. 5 CHARLES My lady ! JEHANNE ( Giving him the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading around the inside of the ring ) :
