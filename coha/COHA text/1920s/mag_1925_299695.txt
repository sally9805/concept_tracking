Newspaper magnates have found it profitable , of late years , to buy rival sheets , not to add to their collections , but to amalgamate them with their own , making one of two ( or three or four ) - reducing competition . But to buy a rival paper , amalgamate it out of existence , and promptly set up another-that is not so usual a procedure . Yet it was done last week , apparently with cogent reasons , depending on a given set of circumstances . <P> The Situation . When Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis strode into journalism , in 1913 , bought the staid , sanctimonious Philadelphia Public Ledger , the eyes that swiveled in his direction widened and awaited a new stroke of genius from the employer of Editors Bok* ( Ladies ' Home Journal ) and Lorimer ( Saturday Evening Post ) . <P> For Publisher Curtis announced loudly , and at great expense , that the Ledger would become " The Manchester Guardian of the U.S. , " in morning and evening editions , which should have meant that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , independent politics , fearless action and international distinction . <P> Lofty tone the Ledger already had , but did not cling to . Sound information the Curtis coffers tried to purchase by establishing a wide foreign service and high-priced U.S. correspondents . Independent politics were a little difficult to maintain , because Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis lunched at the Union League Club and had a reputation for highly respectable conservatism . <P> Fearless action , too , was difficult ; for instance , the large-advertising Philadelaphia department stores might be offended . As for distinction , typical at tempts at it were some editorials by William Howard Taft , some political correspondence by Col. Edward M. House and the installation of an admirable business section . <P> The Ledger , fattening upon Curtis plenty , prospered notably , but locally , It did not become known as " The Manchester Guardian of the U. S. " In addition to his large ambitions , Publisher Curtis was trying to make his paper straddle two divisions of the Philadelphia public-people who avidly pored over the illustrated society section of the Ledger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slang in the headlines and , if denied , would read the Ledger 's morning rival , the North American . <P> The Action . Last week , Publisher Curtis resolved the Ledger 's domestic difficulty in the morning field by purchasing The North American* for amalgamation , thus reducing competition . Then he commenced to publish The Sun , a new capsule sheetlet of " broad popular appeal for all classes of readers . " <P> <P> * " The oldest daily newspaper in America , " descendant of the American Daily Advertiser ( 1784 ) and Benjamin Franklin 's Weekly Pennsylvania Gazette ( 1728 ) .
