Back to England , a month ago , sailed a gossipy-garrulous young Britisher named Beverley Nichols . For some time he had been selling his books and lectures of familiar chit-chat about the world 's Great and Near-Great , to the fame-hungry US. public . For four months he had edited a monthly smartchart called the American Sketch for Doubleday , Doran &; Co . ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) . Upon leaving he told people that he was bored with the American Sketch and had decided to go home and pick up more chit-chat to put into more books for more money . Doubleday , Doran &; Co. let him go , said nothing , and last week let the American Sketch , a failure , be merged quietly with the New York Tatler Social Digest , a smartchart owned by Carlton Publishing Co . The new monthly will be called The Tatler and American Sketch , devoted chiefly to society , sport , Long Island realty.                    @
