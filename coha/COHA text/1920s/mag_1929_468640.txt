THE chief trouble with me , " I used to murmur resentfully to myself and once or twice , I am sorry to say , to Bob , " is that as a wife I 've come just too cheap . No expense for courting or keeping , and compara ? tively little bother . Just see if I do n't bring up my daughters to be the cling-ingest and prickliest roses that ever grew up a stone wall . " The first time that this burst upon me with shattering force was on a summer week-end three years ago . Bob an ? nounced suddenly that he had changed his mind about a long-planned Saturday picnic . He wanted to be in town to see Alice off on the train that was to take her to New York and a transatlantic liner . " Most of her friends are away at this time of year , " he explained a little apologetically . " There wo n't be many of us here to give her a send-off , and the girl is just so eager about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up brown . " Alice is a childless wife , not , as the census would say , " gainfully employed . " Nor otherwise employed , so far as her acquaintances can see , except in looking for pretty clothes , finding the best place in town for a " facial , " and learning what is new in dance steps . She was going abroad for three months ? with her husband and at his expense . He had been doing extra work in the evenings all winter to make that summer possible . The poor girl had n't been over since she married him . As it happened I also was beginning my vacation that Saturday ? four lus ? cious weeks away from the office at the little lake-side cottage we had managed to " buy " with a small down-payment when I got my first substantial raise . I was to spend the first two of these weeks doing the housework and taking care of the children while the house ? keeper had her annual vacation . We had to have a new electric pump that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a much-needed economy to save a substitute 's wages , for the house ? keeper drew her regular pay during her vacation . We had planned to celebrate the beginning of my holiday with a family picnic on the beach , for which the children were all set . Somehow I could n't work up much sympathy with Alice , who might have only ten friends at the train to see her start off for Europe with her husband , though my head told me that this was Bob 's business and I ought to keep quiet . At that moment I would have thrilled in one hundred per cent sympathy with the stories of tired feminist wives told by Lillian Symes in the May HARPER 'S . But since then I have changed my mind . ( I seldom think of myself as a feminist , though often during the past eight years I have been more than a little tired under the combined duties of wife , mother , and wage-earner . ) In the two years that followed the silly indignation of that Saturday in June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends , or in women who were trying a combination of marriage and children , or marriage and job , or job alone , but seldom all three . A little more than a year ago he found himself so attracted to extra-domestic diversions in general that it seemed desirable for mutual self-respect to dissolve our marriage and go our separate ways . Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he has gone his separate way , while I , figuratively speaking , stand about where I was , holding a little yellow-haired girl by either hand , and keeping an anxious eye on the job that supports me and partially supports them . Bob wants to share the expense until they are grown , and I hope fervently that he will keep on wanting to . The anguish that it takes to pry apart a close and affectionate partnership of ten years ' standing begets the need to try to see what it all was about . And now that the worst is a little behind me I know that the game was worth the candle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a bargain . And if I had n't been a bargain I might very well find myself in a different situa ? tion ? and one which from the conven ? tional point of view is supposed to be happier . I do n't like the outcome of my marriage . But if I had to live these ten years over again , I do n't think I could do anything very different . And looking about among my friends , at conventional wives , successful spinsters , and others of the many varieties of women in 10 ! .20 , I know that I am better oft now than I should have been had I not carried the heavy end of a family load . When Bob and I were married we were beginning our twenties , just out of college and both on the bottom rung of the advertising ladder . We had emerged from small Western cities , and Chicago thrilled us . I thrilled Bob be ? cause I was not unattractive and especially because he saw in me a personable example of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached a. little ridicu ? lously to his classmates . Bob thrilled me ? well , I suppose in the way that a good-looking , intelligent , and sensitiveyoung man does thrill one after four years of cloistered female education . There were few other girls in the office except as stenographers . I earned as much as any of the men of my age and experience , which was just about enough to ease one along in tolerable comfort , and I speedily realized that if I wanted company at lunch it was advisable to insist on paying my own way . And only fair . When Bob and I became engaged he told me that he still owed some hundreds of dollars on his college debts . " Some ? how , " he said , a little puzzled at him ? self , " I want to pay this off before we 're married , though we 're lucky because we both believe that it 's more sensible for a woman to earn her share of the income and so we wo n't have to let money stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was scrimping to pay that debt I put by an equal amount each week so as not to have any more spending money than he . My little bank account ( it grew to $300 ) was all the cash we had between us when we decided that the time for marriage had come . No old-fogey courtship fuss for us , flowers , engagement ring , and the like . We took trolleys instead of taxis , and each paid his or her own fare . It was all happy fun , though sometimes I ached from its sweet rationality and longed to have Bob want to take me on a wild jamboree ? football game , dinner , cabaret , midnight show , and two weeks ' earnings gone in an evening . If he had wanted it , I should n't have cared a bit that to do it was impossible . When we got married we decided that we could afford only a week for a honey ? moon , since no vacation was due us at the time . A friend offered to lend us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be hotel bills . Even so , it was a relief when the firm , discovering our romantic intentions , gave us the week with pay and then raised us each $5 in recognition of our altered status . That week cost us , if I remember correctly , $7. ' 24 apiece for food and kerosene , plus the trifling fares to get there and back . That was before I had had any experi ? ence in marketing . Later , $14.48 for a week 's food would have seemed out ? rageous extravagance . I cooked , and Bob washed dishes and we helped each other make the bed ; we did n't know enough about housekeeping to let sweep ? ing burden our minds . Of course we wanted children , lots of them , though not for a time . Neither of us had brothers or sisters , and we were sure that a large family meant a happy human state . Setting up our two-room apartment was a great lark , and when the business of co-operative housekeep ? ing had been tried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We lunched and dined out ? specializa ? tion , we felt , was woman 's right if she wanted to take it ; and was I not to make my mark in captions , not dishpans ? A plump Sally came once a week to dig out seven days ' accumulation of dust . It was much pleasanter than two fur ? nished rooms , and cheaper . When a little more than a year had passed we decided that the next step was a baby , and embarked on Mary Ellen . I hesitated to tell my boss . He had been dubious at my marrying at all , and I knew that now he would say , quite correctly , " Just like a woman . " I had made only a start in my profession , and I wanted to keep that job up to the last possible moment before the baby came and to hasten back when the hospital let me loose . But before the telling became inevitable the need for it vanished . Bob had a hopeful offer of a job in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three-quarters as much as our joint salaries had been , and if living was cheaper there , it would float us both for a while . It seemed a good chance . We took it . By the time we had moved and settled , Mary Ellen was so imminent that it did n't seem worth while for me to get a job before the hospital interlude . Besides there were n't any jobs there ofmy kind . So I settled down , for what I promised myself was six months , to apply my college-trained mind to home ? making . My first errors were more appreciated by the neighbors than by myself . Apparently it was very funny in Poskaloosa eight years ago to see a bride trying to learn to cook by time and temperature tables ! In time I learned , and I enjoyed the learning , but once the problem was mastered it seemed as futile to keep repeating it day in and day out as it would have been to try a daily theme on the same subject for a semester or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . There remained no job in Poskaloosa for which I had experience , except , by this time , general housework or baby-tending . I tried to do book reviews for a Chicago daily whose editors I had met in my advertis ? ing days . It was a real relief to prop even a pretty poor novel up before one on the kitchen table while endlessly pushing carrots through a strainer , but the delays of distance were too great , the pay was all but invisible , so in the end I let it slip . I still insisted that I was in the house ? keeping business only temporarily . In this view Bob backed me loyally . He believed as firmly as ever that the ideal is a husband and wife who go fifty-fifty on income and alternate the night watches when colic comes . But while I was housekeeping temporarily , we asked ourselves , why should we not add a second baby to keep Mary Ellen com ? pany ? By this time our struggles with the budget had scaled down our putative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Ellen , Judy made her appearance . And three months later another promising offer to Bob took us back to Chicago , and the soot over the suburbs looked rosy pink to me as our train rolled in . Somehow , in a few scrambled weeks , I found a place to live , a part-time maid who was at least good-natured , and a part-time job . When I look back now on that winter I feel that it must have been some alien Amazon who lived through it . Up at six to nurse the baby and mix her complicated supplementary feedings for the day , while Bob dressed Mary Ellen and got our breakfast . Run the family wash through the electric washing machine which Lily ( the part-time maid ) feared like a thunder-bolt , while , with the washing for two babies , its use cost us less than her elbow-grease . Write out long instructions as to when who got orange juice and when spinach or cod-liver oil . Then a careful com ? pilation of the grocery list , for which we now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer the family mantle to her shoulders ; then rush downtown to get to the office before ten , thankful that I had one of those almost non-existent part-time jobs . Twenty minutes for lunch if I was to get away by three ; then home , change dress , bathe two babies and nurse one , while urging the other to eat three more teaspoonfuls of cereal ; then get supper , eat it with Bob , and subside on the sofa while he washed the dishes . Aside from the meals and the bed-making and babies ' routine ( Lily , of course , did not come on Sundays but stayed at home to do her own family 's work ) my day of rest was quite clear for darning and dressmaking unless this could be tucked in on Saturday after ? noon . Somehow my ideas of woman 's specialization had become subdued in the scuffle . Of course Bob was entangled in all this domesticity , too , though it seemed to he my game to keep it moving . And needless to say he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ning when the dishes were done and we both sat at home with ears pricked for a wail upstairs . It was then that the Alices began to emerge insidiously on the horizon . Though neither of us realized it at the time , the advent of that second baby was to usher in an unsettling period for us . We told each other that this strain was only for a little while , while the children were small . When theywere older I should be glad to have kept my interests and a life of my own . Just how glad I did n't dream at the time . I do n't think I ever buoyed myself up with the idea that I was living out the feminist doctrine . This just seemed the best way out at the moment for us . Even in college days I had never quite swallowed the feminist philosophy . Probably I came a little late , just at the tail end of the suffrage parade . I had mistrusted the antagonism that the older leaders let slip when they talked of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one if a mutual desire came ray way . And I had felt only a little sorry and not at all abashed once in my early working days when an old war horse turned on me and exploded : " You young women do n't realize that you are walking non ? chalantly over roads that we have paved with our brains and our bodies . " Prob ? ably we were , I realized , recalling that I had not had too much difficulty in breaking into an office said to be hostile to women ; but I could not see much point in offering my brains and body for further pavement . For Bob , however , women 's rights had come ready-mixed with mother 's milk . He believed in them as thoroughly as he disbelieved in the theological tenets that his parents somehow had managed to conserve simultaneously . And be was pleased to see me beginning at last to live up to my multiple female function . Pleased but , alas , not entertained . So to eat the dinners I cooked we had spinsters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I managed it all but who never would have dreamed of buying that arduous com ? petence with the hours that were free to them for planning the next day 's work or the next spring 's suit . I could n't compete , I gradually and reluctantly realized , with the working wives who had no children , nor with the jobless mothers who , having no earnings of their own , often often had spurred their husbands on to incomes far larger than Bob 's . Much less with the single women . In the two years I was away from Chicago I had learned half a dozen household arts which had not been a part of the upbringing of the only daughter of a professional family in the easy eighteen nineties , when hired help in our town cost $3 a week . I had learned that three could live on what one had spent in college days . I had learned to cook and clean and tend babies , to make dresses that would pass because I had an eye for color , to wash clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and re-finish furniture even to the upholstery , and ? crowning achievement ) ? to iron my husband 's shirts so that they looked all right if he did n't take off his coat . ( Unfortunately he liked to take it off . ) These accomplishments had not been a part of my mother 's picture of the education of a daughter said to be bright . They were totally unrecognized in the curriculum of the alma mater which bestowed its blessing upon me cum laude . To acquire them took all the wit and energy I had for a couple of years , and when I went hack to an office , rusty with absence , they did n't help a bit . I had to begin at the bottom again . In fact I found that being a Mother ? it seems always to be capitalized in bated breath ? was a special drawback . They feared I should stay at home the first day a baby had the sniffles . They looked at me a little askance ? they who had worked and played with me gaily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fragile being who could not be treated with reasonable casualness , who might explode or break at any moment . It was hard to convince my employers that I still was first and chiefly a human being . I include all this in my story because I do not want to slur over the difficulties , even though in the end they proved less than the rewards . At first I made headway slowly , and then more easily . Nursery schools sprouted and relieved some of the prob ? lems I had faced with Lily . Somehow we weathered measles and whooping cough ( by the alternate night-watch principle ) . Bob had a timely raise which made it possible to summon a trained nurse when a critical and unpredictable illness did strike Mary Ellen . My half ? time job grew to whole time , for I managed to make myself so useful that they had to have me round all the time and pay me well for being there . Life at home became less of a scramble when our joint increases in earnings got far enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really competent house ? keeper . The next raise ? this time it was mine ? brought us our lake-shore cottage for summer use . I never did reach my goal of earning fifty per cent of the family income , but finally I got to the point at which I turned in two of each five of the dollars . At last I could use my hard-won ingenuity with clothes in buying new ones out of season rather than in furbishing old ones to wear in season and out . But my sense of achievement was turning to bitter bread as I came to realize , slowly and unwillingly , that Bob 's attitude toward me had changed somewhat as had my own attitude to ? ward " scientific " housekeeping : having seen that it could be done , he wanted to try something else in wives , or possibly in women not wives . There was nothing lurid in this gradual cleavage , no secret vice , no substitute marriage lurking in the background , none of those concrete " reasons " that would have seemed satisfying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather it was the slow dissolution of a relationship into which two youngsters had entered when they had little experience in understanding themselves or each other but , being in love with love , were dazzled by the ideas they held in common . What we had hoped for in marriage , unconsciously , only a psychoanalyst could tell ; consciously , at the forefront of our picture was this new game of the fifty-fifty and a mutual respect and Ilk ing which continued to the end . Dur ? ing those first hard years we were united against the gentle doubts of our families and of the world ? which likes home-keeping mothers ? by the stress of being what might be called a demonstration . We did n't have much opportunity to lift our noses from the grindstone and think about anything else . But as we began to find ourselves equal to the three-ring circus of jobs , marriage , and chil ? dren , the strain slackened and we had a chance to look up and about . The foundation of our marriage came to depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than upon what we did for each other . Bob 's more glamorous business asso ? ciations led naturally to friendships with people whose ways I could not follow . I could not dance till three and face my desk clear-headed at nine to take up a considerable weight of responsibility and detail . Outside the nine-to-five routine of my office day there was a fringe of household detail which even the best of housekeepers can not assume ; there was also the family shopping , and last , but not least , my companionship with the children . While children are young , their emotional as well as their physical demands seem to be more arduous ? and more rewarding ? for the mother than for the father . My crowded day some ? times left me a little languid for an evening 's festivities , and then it was hard not to watch the clock if guests lingered on till the little hours . These are small things . If our relationship had been strong enough and deep enough , they would not have arisen , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper place in the picture . As it was , they seemed to drive us apart . I do n't feel " settled " ; I love to dance and I want all the other gay things of life . But for me fun , like old-time char ? ity , begins at home and when my time and strength seem limited , home may hold it all . An outsider who had seen our comings and goings probably would not guess it , but I think that these yearsof working for and with the children have been more satisfyingly adventurous to me than Bob 's more successful profes ? sional and social life has been to him . And I could hardly have saved more energy for keeping up with him in the pleasant diversions of life by doing less work , for to do so would have meant less income , and less income would have lessened the leeway of all of us , Bob , the children , and myself . As I look back , I seem to see that while I probably meant a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? radeship and the rest ? fun was not prominent among them . That was not the " fault " of either of us , I think , but just the mark of our mistake I was what he thought I ought to be , rather than what , through and through , he wanted me to be . In the shuffle of the years the " oughts " lost their flavor , the " wants " remained unsatisfied . The amount of energy that we spent in try ? ing to make over ourselves and each other might have leveled mountains , but it had little avail against tidal currents . Such a drift as this , when it is walled in by social and religious conventions , by a limitation of money which makes it impossible for a family to pay more than one rent check , by inner scruples and repressions , produces the kind of nine days ' newspaper wonder in which one middle-aged spouse goes off with a bang , leaving the other to pick up the debris . It is the kind of a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ings , that sets the stage for the moon and sixpence . When an explosion comes , it is simple to blame the one who cracked first and pity the other . And usually the explosion comes so late that neither can ever really regain a balance . But fortunately for us and for our children , we realized our mistake while we still were young , and we were able to talk frankly to each other and let off the steam as it generated . It was pain ? ful ? exceedingly painful ? but not hate ? ful and destructive . The situation we faced is common enough . Without it the output of novels , Broadway produc ? tions , and newspaper stories would be sadly curtailed , and Hollywood could hardly exist at all . The only thing at all uncommon was that the woman in the case ? myself ? had her own money and work and interests and friends . Without these , the world being as it is , I should have been put at an almost intolerable disadvantage by our parting . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really good sort . If I had n't been able to take care of myself ; if I had n't developed an aptitude for swing ? ing both a job and a home , probably he would still be here . I wish he were ? I mean , granting he wanted to be ? hut since things have n't turned out that way , what could be more disintegrating for him , for me , and for our children than to have him here just because there was n't an honorable means of exit ? The irony is that a fair and friendly ending of our partnership should seem " unnecessary " to people who would have " understood " if we had held on to the point of bitterness and recrimination . Inevitably , after the children are in bed , when often I am too tired to seek or accept company or even to read , I go back over what has happened in a kind of hypothetical post mortem . Suppose I had married the other man who wanted me when Bob did ? He re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing and worked like a slave for five years till he gat the nucleus of the fortune which now sweeps them along easily . He is thin and worn , and she is fat , and neither looks happy . They did n't take time out to afford children and now , set in their ways , they fear any change . But I did n't want to marry him then , and I should n't have liked the angle-track strain of those first five years any better than my problems in Poska ? loosa , and I would n't exchange my life for hers at this very minute . Suppose I had n't married at all ? Probably I should be farther along in my profession , and I might even have obtained by this time the fabulous salary and assured future income that a few women have won from advertising . But I have known one or two of these out ? standing successes in middle age , and their lives seem bleak , though glittering . I would n't swap even one of my gay young daughters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ups and downs and what the tabloids call the heartaches , there has been a kind of adventurous intensity in living which I believe these women have missed , what ? ever their substitutes for marriage . Suppose Bob and I had married but had not had children ? I could have been prettier , better dressed , more amusing . Perhaps he would have found that enough . But I think not . We both wanted the children and through them came the deepest experience of our common life . To have evaded it would have been to have failed ourselves , and I think it could only have hastened the rift between us . And the children ? That is the ques ? tion that always came to the eyes if not the lips of our families and friends when we told them we had separated . The children have failed , we both agree , to get the supreme gift that parents can give a son or daughter ? the setting of a home based on a rich and satisfying emotional relationship . But are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happy and busy . I do not believe that they will grow up distrusting marriage because our attempt was un ? successful , any more than they will feel that the harp is an inferior instrument because neither of us can play it , or the airplane a poor mode of locomotion because Bob is not Colonel Lindbergh , nor I Amelia Earhart . They have seen us admit failure with ? out dismay and , because we have not been dismayed , they have been spared ! ! the sense of insecurity which is the really ' corroding experience of childhood . They know that we both are still their parents , that we both are working for their sup ? port ; that we are each other 's friend and theirs . 111 this situation , of course , they have an exceptional advantage in being in a large city among people who share our general ideas . They are not likely to be hit by scorn and derision . Elsewhere it might have been very much harder for all of us , and especially for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sym ? bol of the feminist ghosts whom Mrs. Symes evoked ? has had little to do with our difficulties except to make it possi ? ble for us to acknowledge them and to meet them with dignity and a measure of freedom for all of us . Aside from its financial aspects , my job has given me interests and friends ? in addition to those I shared with Bob ? which were a great lift in a trying transition . I am sure that these interests and friends are a real asset to the children as well . They see me not merely as a part of a family circle which has broken to pieces , but as a person on her own feet who is busy , useful , and respected . My job is a job , and not a " career . " It combines a good deal that is interest ? ing with much that is merely hard work or downright drudgery . I have no de ? lusion that it is of any special impor ? tance to the world or that through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that I can do it well enough to be worth my useful salary and at the same time keep the good-will and liking of the men and women with whom I am working . I like it as one likes an old friend , admitting its shortcomings . And if Bob were in a position to offer me an assured income for life for myself and the children , I doubt if I should give up the job unless I found other work that I iked better . Certainly not now . A final speculation goes still deeper into the realm of surmise . Perhaps hus ? muds , by and large , need to feel that . heir wives must cling to them to bolsterup their own egos ? Should one cling , therefore , even if one has n't the impulse or perhaps the aptitude ? I am sure that there have been times when Bob wanted to feel himself all-important ; more likely than not , at the next mo ? ment the fifty-fifty idea came into as ? cendency again . Some women want to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ably men are much the same . Perhaps when we went back to Chicago I should have done better to batten down my desire to get out and see people . Perhaps I should have im ? mured myself with the babies . Without my salary , there would have been no money for any sort of a maid . I doubt if this course would have helped any of us very much . Again it would have meant the padded-cell domesticity of Poskaloosa . I wanted to work , and most of the time Bob wanted me to work . I am not a natural born house ? keeper and , kept too long in that track , I should have become unbearably fussy and over-anxious . That would have been especially hard on the children . Such questions and answers as these are only speculations , inconclusive in even one instance , and , of course , purely academic since , being what I was , I could not have done other than I did . Yet they suggest , I believe , a real di ? lemma which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who am " neither maid nor wife nor widow . " We are in a gyrating world as regards the forms of marriage and family sup ? port . Perplexed husbands are likely to think one thing and feel another ? hus ? bands especially , perhaps , since however modern their utterances , they have a way of cherishing in their unconscious many of the comforts that mother used to make . And mothers in the nineties did have a sweeter and simpler role . If we marry the men who interest us when we are young and eager to marry , they are likely to need our help financially , at least for a time . And simultaneously , and without realizing it , they are likely to ex pect a good deal of us that is hardly compatible with a pay envelope . More fundamental than the changing conventions of marriage is our present-day effort to grow away from the idea of living by conventions at all , even those of right and wrong . A generation ago Bob and I would have stuck it out some ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people did that for the sake of their religion , their friends , and their families . It was the right thing to do . Now though the shades of my New England forebears rise up to confound me , I can ? not feel that it was either " good " or ' bad " for us to refuse to continue marriage . We had weighed the pros and cons for months before a decision came , and made one honest try after another , only to fail again . The break was painful to both of us and hence " too bad . " It is as painful to break a crooked bone as a straight one . But if it is crooked , that is a matter of fact and not of morals . It may not be " fair " for me that after I have put ten hard-working years into trying to live up to my part of a family compact , the whole reason for the fam ? ily 's being should gradually slip out from under . But fairness has surprisingly little to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feminists , like some of the pre-war radicals , are " tired " now because they have been looking not at actual situations but at theories . They worked out lovely ra ? tional plans of how everything would work in a just and lawful world . And when things do n't come out that way they are " tired . " Basically they were intent not on their new arrangement of life for its own sake but for what they thought it would get them . Put at its crudest , they would insure love by as ? suming work . Love still seems to have little to do with logic . And when they had shown that they could vote and earn their own living and have children as well , they were hurt by finding that men did n't seem to like them any better or longer because of it ? even men who had been loud in urging this or that course of female conduct . Perhaps these men es ? pecially . I speak feelingly , for I too have slipped from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . whether feminists or masculinists or just ourselves , when we can carve our lives for the joy in each stroke of the carving and accept our disappointment if the result does not look to others as we had hoped it might . Their verdict can not rob us of any gain that has become a part of ourselves-in-the-making . To come back to my own experience , I am sure that the mistake that ditched us was not my decision to do what we thought was my share and what ? by and large ? I wanted to do . That mis ? take was the initial blunder of any mar ? riage at all between the sorts of persons we were . Possibly if Bob had really loved me as well as he loved his idea of what I was , he would have yearned to take me on the jamboree for which I longed . Possibly I should have been content to keep house forever in Poska ? loosa .
