A report signed by Herbert Hoover , Secretary of Commerce ( written late in the summer after the appointment of Secretary Whiting , his successor ) was published last week . Last commercial survey by the man who made the Commerce Department famous , it covered fiscaf 1928 , which ended June 30 , just after Mr. Hoover was nominated and before his resignation was accepted . It sounded very familiar , being largely a replica of its author 's campaign speech . " Fiscal 1928 , " said Mr. Hoover , " had continued the high economic activity which has become characteristic of American industry . " He cited the Mississippi flood , the cotton depression , and a temporary abeyance of motor-making ( Ford 's style change ) , as the causes of a recession of indices last fall which was recovered last spring . He said : " Unemployment was relatively unimportant . . . the rate of real wages and the standard of living of the masses of the people remained higher than anywhere else in the world. * <P> The dollar-volume of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4,968 millions reached in 1927 . But this was due to lower prices . Quantitatively exports increased slightly . The dollar-volume would have risen but for the poor cotton crop . <P> On the import side , there were slight declines in the dollar-volume of foodstuffs , raw materials and semi-manufactures , but an increase in manufactures . The manufactures item indicated increased competition from abroad and illustrated that price-reductions were also the cause of shrinkage in dollar-volume of imports . Quantitatively , 1928 imports increased nearly 3% over 1927 and the total was record-breaking . <P> The " Balance-of-Trade " - ratio of exports over imports-remained favorable . The export margin amounted , in merchandise , to some $731,000,000-about the same as in the last seven years . Gold exports , also , were heavy in 1928 , in contrast to the heavy influx of gold in 1927 . This indicated a general fortifying of the buying power of U.S. customers . <P> <P> * See footnote to Jardine Report .                    @
