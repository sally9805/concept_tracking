The Times , London , printed the report by J. H. Edgar , inland missionary , of a severe earthquake at Hor Drangu on the China-Tibetan frontier . <P> Mr. Edgar said : " Beyond Dawo we began to get startling confirmation of the havoc wrought by a mighty force from the bowels of the earth . At one village we found that every house had been leveled to the earth and quite half of the inhabitants killed . <P> " The zone of maximum intensity was not reached until the next morning . There was found nothing standing for a distance of about 100 li ( 40 miles ) . Well built Tibetan houses were leveled to the ground and their timbers reduced to gigantic heaps of matchwood . Great rents extended along the plain for miles . Mounds and hill tops were smashed and powdered and sections of hills thrown out . <P> " The loss of life in this zone was enormous and at one place we counted about a score of bodies blocking the river . Catholic mission station was demolished and the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . <P> " There is no doubt that we were face to face with the results of an earthquake of maximum intensity which demolished every building and killed perhaps 50% of the people . "
