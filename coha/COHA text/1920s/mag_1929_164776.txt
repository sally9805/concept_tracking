Manhattan and Chicago each have one permanent opera company ( see pp. 52 &; 54 ) . Philadelphia has three . Last week all three began the season . The Philadelphia Grand Opera Company , under new Conductor Emil Mynarski , presented Carmen in French with Sophie Braslau . The Philadelphia Civic Opera , under Conductor Alexander Smallens , gave Prince Igor in Russian with a Russian cast and ballet . The Pennsylvania Grand Opera gave Boito 's Mefistofele in Italian . Most interesting to watch this year will be the Philadelphia Grand Opera , which begins its first season in cooperation with Mrs. Edward Bok 's Curtis Institute of Music .
