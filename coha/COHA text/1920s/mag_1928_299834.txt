Rotary International was internationally roasted last week by a Catholic bishop in Spain and a Methodist pastor in Manhattan . Because Rotary clubs seem to him to omit the religious idea , because it is " damnable for individuals or societies to try to moralize with a naturalist or atheistic doctrine , " the Bishop of Valencia issued a bulletin discouraging Catholics from-joining the clubs . <P> " If Jesus came to New York today , He would not be identified with any . . . Rotary club , " said the Rev. John A. Vollenweider , associate pastor of the Madison Avenue Methodist Episcopal church . " He Christ . . . was mindful of the need of those who were rich in this world 's goods , but had a sense of spiritual poverty . "
