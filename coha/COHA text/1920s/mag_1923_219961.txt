His audience consisted of Secretary of the Navy Denby and the Congressional party which witnessed the maneuvers . <P> With the maps of the campaign spread before him , the Admiral pointed out how the defenses of the Canal should be strengthened : the coast defense batteries should be more scattered so that ships may not approach to bombard the Canal from angles out of reach of the land guns . There should be several new batteries of 16-inch guns with a range equal to those mounted by any navy . Toboga Island , nine miles from the western entrance of the Canal , should be equipped with batteries to prevent an enemy fleet from approaching the Canal closely enough to bombard the Miraflores locks . There should be an adequate aeroplane force ( 100 or 150 planes ) to drive off enemy bombers . The Navy should have light cruisers ( of which it has none , although Great Britain has 60 and Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleets . Ten of these craft are now being built by our Government , but it is thought that more will be necessary . Finally , we should have more and faster submarines to prevent bombarding fleets from approaching the coast .
