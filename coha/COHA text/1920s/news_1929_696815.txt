txt Liquidation continued in the stock market yesterday and forced now low levels in the leading issues . The break of Monday had further weakened some of the margined accounts and where customers were unable to raise additional funds the commission houses found it necessary to dispose of stocks for their own protection . Such necessitous selling is always done without any attempt to get a fixed price . so that bids are filled and declines are recorded . For a time before the end of the first hour there was sufficient covering of shorts by the bear traders to bring about a good recovery from the early low levels . but the rally did not sold , as the higher prices attracted new liquidation and profit taking by early buyers . The result was that final prices were considerably under the initial levels . As in the past vague rumors were circulated all over the Street regarding " something hanging over the market " but no details were mentioned .

Bear Dries Flushed with their successes in the past , the ' bears have not yet abandoned the practice of attacking the market . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition and forced stocks lower to bring out the liquidation which comes when margins are further impaired . The lower levels which have followed have permitted many of the shorts to take in their commitments at a good sized profit . Fa ? ; End Liquidation Talk has been heard that fag end liquidation has been coming into the market , but in this connection it is probably true that what has been normally considered as fag end forced selling has not yet developed ' Usually such supply comes just before the market is ready for a sustained turn . The liquidation thus far has been the result of heavy margin impairment because of the steady lowering of prices . Stabilization There is as yet no indication of stabilization . Market observers who have been in the Street for many years point out that stabilization will only come after a period of small dealings and irregular price movements . ' When conditions as outlined exist , these observers will be will ; ing to admit that stabilization probably has been reached .
