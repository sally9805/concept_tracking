txt Clarence . D. Chamberlin and Bert Acosta , . American civilian fliers , brought the world 's non-Stop record back to the United States yesterday with a continuous flight of 51 hours 11 minutes - and 25 seconds . In their sturdy Bellanca monoplane they beat by nearly six hours the record madein . France by the French , Army officers , Drouhin and Landry , who flew a Farman biplane 45 hours 11 minutes and 59 seconds at Etampes in August , 1925 . The fliers kept on for twenty-four hours without food or drink , after they had ? already been in the air a day  --  and , a night and half another day of exceedingly : rough going for such a test . Hour after weary hour they followed a course that ' took them back and forth above the flying fields of Long Island . Sometimes they went out over the ocean " to practice flying by compass and navigation , " as Chamberlin remarked with a tired grin as he told the story of the flight yesterday afternoon . For these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to fly a single-motored plane across the Atlantic to Paris . Early this morning mechanics will remove the motor that sustained them so well and put in another . " In three days we could be ready to start , " Giuseppe M. Bellanca , designer of the plane , said . He added , howI ever , that several weeks . would be consumed in careful preparation . " We could have made it this time , " Acosta and Chamberlin chimed in , and they explained how they figured they had flown , since they took the air at 9:30:40 Tuesday morning , well over 4,000 miles . Both of them are eager to go , although the plans for the dash have not been settled . Only One Serious Mishap . The endurance flight nearly ended before it was well started by the one mishap that occurred . They took off well , rising with their useful load of 3,080 pounds after a run of only 1,200 feet , which both pilots declare is a record for such a light plane . They had hardly cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude when the gasoline was cut off . Chamberlin quickly sheered off ready to make a. landing in Mitchel Field , while both men searched swiftly for the trouble . " We had shut off our gas without knowing it , " Chamberlin said . " In closing the windows and getting things adjusted and tested one of us had hit a knee or an elbow against the.gadget on the gas line and shut It off . , We found it , luckily , and kept going . " , For the first thirty-six hours it . was bumpy going In more ways than  --  Aine . Air conditions were not ' good . The wind kept shifting , coming first from the south , veering suddenly into the west and changing back again- to the south . Early Tuesday cloud banks piled up and at sunset the " ceiling " was exceedingly low  --  so low , in fact , that the aviators gave up their projected visits to Manhattan , Brooklyn and the Bronx . Then something happened to the oil thermometer gauge , a most necessary accessory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a record . " You see , we were sitting on the oil , " Acosta said , " and we could tell easily enough when it was hot . ? ' We did n't need any other gauge . " Food and Water Go . Bad . ? This handy method of ' testing their lubrication system , however , ; iever , wall , responsible for the exhauetiOn. , of , their supplies . Milk , which Chamberlain depended on , was warmed up ? by  --  this same heat , turned sour and he did not dare drink it . Then the - two ' thermos bottles of soup turned bad and ' had to be thrown out . ? Next something ' went wrong with two of their four canteens of drinking water . It tasted as- if it had been in the canteens. since the Civil War , according-to the pilots . The other supplies , beef and chicken ' sand ' wiches and chocolate bars , - . - all thirst producing foods , gave out genies ' time Wednesday forenoon and ' the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by noon of the same : day. , But they kept on , sometimes ' flying low because of the clouds ' aand : again higher levels for better Whid , Conditions .

After a half hour on the mattress they felt ready to return to the task in hand , that of nursing the Wright J-5 motor along to the fiftyhour goal they had set . With a gas supply of 385 gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . He was not far wrong . " I know the plane is efficient I know the Wright ' Whirlwind motor can do the work and I know the men . " Speaking English carefully and precisely , - with just a slight accent , the little engineer thus explained his estimates . Gas Consumption Cut Bowl . Gas consumption for each hour , with the gradual loss of weight through consumption of gas and oil , had been so carefully worked out and the pilots followed their engineering schedule so rigidly that in spate of their difficulties even the fifty-hour record they had set out to make was beaten . At the start , with the heavy load , the motor turned at the rate of 1,750 revolutions a minute . At a thousand feet Chamberlin cut his throttle to 1,550 , and as the load lightened the engine was slowed until yesterday morning the propeller revolutions were about 1,000 and the gas consumption was cut to about five gallons an hour . During the first night and the first and second days conditions were far from ideal for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rain and more bad winds were in the offing , the sky cleared , stars and moon shone out , and the mist , clouds and winds were followed by splendid flying weather . Mr. Bellanca. was the only one of those closely connected with the flight who went to bed Thursday night He felt sure of success , basing his belief on the exactitude of his calculations . The others , including his superintendent , John Carisi , mechanic% pilots from other fields and the ever-present Carl Schory of the National Aeronautic Association , the official timer , watched the monoplane through the night . Interest increased to excitement as the slow minutes became slower hours . At 9:35:15 Thursday evening Acosta and Chamberlin had beaten the American record of 36 hours 4 minutes 34 seconds , made by Lieutenants Macready and Kelly in 1923 . As Mr. Schory made the announcement cheers went up from the crowd . During the greater part of the darkness the monoplane kept within hearing and often within sight , since the night was so clear . Once for an hour it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over the ocean " practicing navigation " again . Fire Scare Near End of Flight . Just at sunrise when the world 's record -. vas almost a matter of Minutes , the spectators had a scare . The elane had been flying west It swung about into the rising sun which reflected a gleam like a flame from the windows of the cockpit . Some one cried " She 's afire , " and the crowd leaped into cars and started across the country . But there was no fire . The incident showed how nerves had been frayed by the long vigil . The plane kept on , throttled down to seventy or seventy-five miles an hour . At 6:42:40 Mr. Schory , stop-watch in band , announced that the world 's record had been broken . The plane at this moment was over Roosevelt Field whence it had started , and those who had kept it company from the ground through the night followed there . When Schory waved his hand the crowd , which had grown to several hundred , cheered , yelled and danced for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane that had been in service for more than a year . using a motor that had already seen more than 20.000 miles of Fervice. had broken a record made in a specially built plane . Through the morning Acosta and Chamberlin nursed their plane carefully . keeping close to Roceevelt Field . where , according to the regulations of the competition , she must land . Up and down and around they flew . their motor thrumming slowly but steadily . the monoplane bumping along in the uneven air like a rowboat on choppy water . To the layman she looked almost clumsy . Experts . however , who were in all parts of the field , were quick to explain drat the " boys were doing their stuff , saving the precious gas , making the record that will stand . " Thousands at Flying Field . At 9:30 , when forty-eight hours had passed , several hundred persons - were on the field and in the next hour the hundreds increased to thousands . Nassau County police roped off a section and drove off CC.ficials and trespassers indiscriminately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car . Shortly before noon the Bellanea plane stopped its sluggish manoeuvres . The air around the monoplane was filled with photographing and army machines , which swooped and raced about , paralleling and trying to come close enough to talk to the tired pilots . Suddenly the Bellanca picked up speed . It chased one plane , raced beyond another and started to climb . " We knew then we had made the fifty hours , " Acosta explained later . " and we decided to show those army fliers that we had some speed . " From seventy to eighty and then to a hundred miles an hour , the pilots sped their plane and when they finally throttled down again they had climbed from 2,000 to 4,000 feet . At that level they spent the fifty-first hour . The experts said they were getting ready to come down . The fliers climbed , they said , to add every second possible in the glide . Comes Down in Long Glide . At 12:37 P. M. the motor stopped and sputtered and then began the long glide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from the crowd . A small biplane landed just ahead of the Bellanca , and scurried to one side . Frantic motorcycle policemen chased photographers from the way . At 12:41:5 , according to Schory 's watch as he stood on the seat of an automobile speeding after the plane , it touched earth . A moment later the plane came to rest facing the crowd , which ripped down the ropes and quickly surrounded it . Chamberlin had brought it down on a " dead stick . " He had exhausted their gas except for a " teacup full , " which he used as he brought the plane to a stop . The first person to reach the cockpit was Carisi , who climbed to the window on Chamberlin 's side and with Latin ferver kissed him on both cheeks . Then he swung around like a monkey under the propeller to greet Acosta with equal warmth . Next the wives of the two fliers were ifted up for their greetings , and after waving and smiling for a minute the pilots climbed stiffly from their seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milled around and shrieked and cheered for minutes . With the help of a score of policemen they were finally stowed beside their wives and friends in two cars and went to the Garden City Hotel for food . Mechanics tested and examined the Bellanca , poured in gas and oil and pronounced it fit to fly again . A touch to the propeller , contact and again the engine roared , and a pilot for the Wright Aerometer Corporation lifted it off the ground and flew to the hangar at Curtiss Field . After a dinner in their rooms the two champions talked a little . Acosta could hear with difficulty , and both men were visibly worn , although they declared they were not tired and would not go to bed . Friend of Pilots Dies in Crash . As friends and interviewers entered tho NOM they ' werp cautioned to say nothing to Chamberlin and Acosta about the death of a fellow-pilot and friend , John Parkes Andrews , who was killed with two passengers a scant half-mile from Roosevelt Field shortly after they had taken off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An amateur who refused to give his name tried to land late in the morning , pushed the nose of his plane into the earth and turned a complete somersault . With a passenger , also unidentified , he crawled out unharmed . Acosta is much larger than Chamberlin , who is a wiry man of 160 pounds . Both men had reported themselves as weighing less than the scales actually showed for fear Mr. Bellanca would not let them fly . Acosta modestly recorded his 210 pounds of bone and muscle as 190 and Chamberlin declared himself to weigh 150 . They did n't think that they lost much weight , but said they got " rather hungry . " It took some questioning to get them to talk . Finally when asked about the plane and the prospective flight to Europe both answered at once . " I 'd take that same motor and start for Paris . " Chamberlin declared . " I would prefer that plane and motor to any other I have flown for the transatlantic hop , " Acosta said . " No , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued Chamberlin . " We had too much to do . " Night flying , they agreed . made the time pass more swiftly than daylight . More vigilance and care distracted their attention from the slow passage of time . " And last night was ideal , " Chamberlin raid . " It was beautiful . " Then he described the end of the flight . " Wa climbed 4,000 feet , and then when cur gas was gone we glided down  --  free . for nothing . She did the last two hours on her reputation . " Following the interview the wives of the tired aviators took them in charge and declared that " enough was enough . " Mrs. Acosta said she and her husband would stay with friends in Jamaica and Mrs. Chamberlin took her husband home to Hasbrouck Heights , N. J. Bank as Best Civilian Pilots . The pilots of the Bellanca plane rank as two of the best civilian pilots in the country . Clarence Chamberlin has long been known for his technical knowledge of aviation and his skill in solving aeronautical problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best natural flying man in the country . Flying is instinctive with him . Some who have watched his career say he can do things in a plane which no other pilot could do and live . Chamberlin is 32 years old , and was born in Dennison , Ia . His birthday comes on Armistice Day , Nov. 11 . He went to the State University at Ames . Ia. , studied electrical engineering and when war was declared entered the army and went into the Mr Service . He has long been a test pilot , one of the best in the country . He has had one bad crash . During the air races at Mitchel Field in 1925 , a Ballanca plane he was piloting fell and killed his passenger , Lawrence Buranelli . When the flight to Paris was first thought of Chamberlin had much to do with bringing it about . He has long wanted to fly across the Atlantic . He made careful preparations , and Lieutenant Leigh Wade was asked to take part in the flight . Due to some disagreement Wade withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Acosta Is a daredevil flier who takes many chances in an airplane and generally he gets away with it . He has cracked up several times but never seriously . He was an instructor during the war and has since been a test pilot . He has flown many new types of machines , and piloted the first big Fokker to be brought to this country . He won the Pulitzer air race in 1921 with a speed of 176 miles an hour . Acosta has taken part in many other races and always made a good showing . He has astounded many by his stunt flying . He would try to loop a truck if wings could be put on it , some of his fellow pilots have said . Once he came ' down in a tiny racing plane , which had wheels that could be drawn up into the fuselage. and forgot to put them down . He skidded along on the fuselage for 100 yards without damaging the plane seriously and not injuring himself . Acosta has two boys , Bertrand , 4 , and Allyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to their father , although there is nothing else that he likes to do quite so well . Wives Are Not Worried . Neither Mrs. Chamberlin nor Mrs. I Acosta worries about the work her husband does . Both said yesterday that they hoped their husband would start out together on the Paris flight , which Mr. Bellanca declared would be soon . His black eyes were shining with suppressed excitement , but his voice was as calm and his enunciation as precise as usual . His associate , Charles E. Levine , who is Chairman of the Board of the Columbia Aircraft Company , successors to the Wright-Bellanca Company , which built the record-breaking monoplane , Mr. Bellanca said , was in Detroit negotiating for the purchase of the Rickenbacker plant , which may be used as a manufacturing plant for Bellanca monoplanes . Mrs. Levine , however , was present yesterday from early morning until the test was over . Among other interested spectators were Major H. C. Davidson . operations officer , and Captain Bender of Mitchel Field , which has provided quarters and other facilities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company , and a number of other officials watched the tests . Charles L. Lawrence , President of the Wright Aeronautical Corporation , and C. G. Peterson , assistant to the Vice President of the same concern , which built the motor used in the test . were delighted with the results . " I did not believe that in the first test that motor would do the trick . " Mr. Peterson said . " I could n't help but feel that some little thing might break , might go Trong just enough to spoil the attempt . I knew , of course , that we could build a mctor that would do it , but I did n't think that this one would . It has already done about 30,000 miles , and except for new rings and pistons had not been built over . "
