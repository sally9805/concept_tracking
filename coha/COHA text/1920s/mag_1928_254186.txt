HAROLD THE WEBBED or THE YOUNG VIKINGS : Being Volume Two of the Life and Works of TRADER HORN-Alfred Aloysius Horn and Ethelreda Lewis-Simon and Schuster ( $3.50 ) . <P> A year ago it was expensively announced that an ancient peddler in South Africa had told a thrilling life story , and the announcement has since been repeated with excerpts and illustrations- " Trader Horn " heavily bearded , chugging a pipe ; the same man , less bearded , dragging Cecil Rhodes from the jaws of a crocodile . Critics cavilled , questioned the veracity of many incidents , doubted this man had experienced them all . Whether his narrator 's instinct consciously prompted the use of the first person , or whether in his senility he confused hearsay with his own experience , or whether he actually experienced the myriad thrilling episodes of his reminiscences , was subject of speculation . <P> No speculator , a certain Dr. Fred Puleston* is violently convinced of fraud . In righteous indignation he marshals evidence to prove " that bleary old Munchausen . . . an unmitigated liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecil Rhodes . " The slander : that Livingston married a black , that Stanley was a murderer , that Rhodes , drunk on prickly-pear brandy , had to be rescued from the crocodile . Employed for many years by the English firm ( Hatton &; Cookson ) which sent " Horn " to Africa , Puleston declares that the recorded exploring expeditions , river charting , native battles , elephant hunts , " gorilla purveys , " and rescue of a captive English girl , were impossible for any young employe , virtually a desk-bound office boy , of Hatton &; Cookson . Unfortunately " Horn " lays claim to these experiences during his term of employ by that prosaic firm-a term which Employe Puleston computes as three to six years rather than the implied " lifetime " of 20-30-40 years . <P> In the face of such criticism , Ethelreda Lewis , discoverer , editor , and co-author of Trader Horn , maintains confidence in her garrulous and often tedious old peddler . And by way of backing up her publishers ' brilliant advertising campaign , based as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes a 52-page introduction to volume two , refuting all past and future doubts as to authenticity . She emphasizes the difficulty of computing dates because the trader 's 74 years have ( conveniently ) mingled and mellowed into great confusion : instance his conviction that the Great War was in 1902 . She records his various returns to Africa-offering an unmistakable loophole for the " lifetime " in Africa . <P> Thereupon follows a story which was written at the same time as volume one , but even the trader admits " I could n't lay claim this time to its being autobiography . " Himself a Lancastrian , " Horn " grew up with all the folklore of a yarn-swapping race , and out of remembered bits from the mouths of old men he has woven a maundering tale of his Viking ancestors : Young Harold , born with webbed hands and feet - emblem of luck in a seagoing world-set out a-pirating with a crew of other " elderly boys " ; the climax to their voyage , a sharp exchange of their arrows for rocks catapulted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
