Last week , there developed a major struggle concerning the conduct of the Government . One combatant was undoubtedly the richest man in public life . His opponent was probably the second richest man in public life . <P> Both made high marks in the business world before entering politics . Both entered politics for the love or the honor of it . The first , Andrew W. Mellon , Secretary of the Treasury , has been noted for nonpartisan conduct in office . The second , James Couzens , junior Senator from Michigan , is known for the many great services he rendered his city , Detroit , of which he was mayor . <P> Yet they have long been at swords ' points . When Mr. Mellon issued his tax reduction plan more than a year ago , Mr. Couzens was one of the first to challenge its wisdom . The exchange between the two grew heated and ended by Mr. Couzens ' suggesting that they hire a hall , divide the expense and debate for the public . More recently , Senator Couzens revived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bureau of Internal Revenue . Some days ago , a report from this Senate committee investigation was made public . It charged the Treasury Department with laxity in collecting income taxes . <P> On the same day that the Couzens report came out , Mr. Couzens was notified that the Treasury Department had received information that the tax he had paid on his income for 1919 was too small ; in the course of a few days , he was served with a notice of an additional tax assessment of almost $11,000,000 for that year . <P> So was the battle joined . <P> The Committee 's Charges . Among a number of cases brought , three principal cases of alleged laxity in collection of income taxes were discussed in detail by the Couzens Committee : <P> 1 ) The Atlantic , Gulf &; West Indies Steamship Corporation ( AGWI ) . Against this company , for four years ( 1917 to 1920 ) was assessed a tax of $9,913,841 , including a penalty of $830,808 for fraud . It was charged that the company was worth $9,909,407 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax for $2,600,000- a loss to the Government of more than $7,000,000 . <P> To this , Mr. Mellon replied that the company had other creditors prior to the Government ; that , if the Government had pressed its entire claim , it would have thrown the company into bankruptcy with the chance that the Government might get nothing . So the Treasury investigated , determined how much it thought the company could raise from its bankers and accepted that amount . <P> 2 ) Copper Companies . It was charged that the Treasury had lost $50,000,000 in taxes for the years 1917 and 1918 by allowing excessive valuations ( for computing depletion and invested capital ) ; that the Anaconda Copper Co. in particular , claiming $184,152,965 valuation , valued at $54,865,822 by the Chief of the Metals Valuation Section , had been allowed $188,713,192- even more than it claimed .
