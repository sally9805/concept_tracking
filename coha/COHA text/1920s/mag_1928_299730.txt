Now that the electorate has been agitated to a state of anticipation , if not of excitement , by the prospective election of the 31st President , how might shrewd crooks make gain without accepting direct graft ? <P> One way might be as follows , in simple steps : <P> 1 ) Go to a printer and cause him to print a quantity of official-looking tickets for a Hoover or a Smith picnic , or both , at such-and-such amusement resorts on such-and-such days . <P> 2 ) Let the tickets include a round-trip by bus , starting from a stated point . <P> 3 ) Make the price for the day 's outing comparatively cheap-$2.50 or even $2 . <P> 4 ) Sell the tickets among eager , gullible working-folk . <P> 5 ) Send no busses , have no picnic , vanish . <P> Such was the racket worked last week in Hudson County , N. J. , bailiwick of Democratic Vice Chairman Frank Hague . Some 200 laborers and families , adherents of Nominees Hoover and Smith stood at adjacent points on a Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid $2 for Hoover tickets , $2.50 for Smith tickets . The day lengthened . The sun grew hot . The children made friends , played , squealed , quarreled . The men compared tickets , oaths and boredom . No busses , no picnics came to pass . All , angry , went home .
