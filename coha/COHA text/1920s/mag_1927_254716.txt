William Averell Harriman , U. S. financier who has been cruising about central and eastern Europe the last few years seeking opportunities for investing his money , last week clinched control of all manganese ore mined in the Soviet Union . Two years ago the Soviet gave him a concession to mine manganese , invaluable ore for toughening steel , in the Caucasus Mountains , between the Black and the Caspian Seas . He was to pay the Soviet Government $3 for each ton of manganese mined and to rebuild a railroad from Tiflis to Poti . He had to produce at least 500 tons of manganese a year in order to make a profit on his investment . <P> But , immediately after Promoter Harriman received his concession , Soviet agents attempted to circumvent him by working the manganese mines at Nikopol in the Ukraine , north of the Black Sea . <P> Last week , according to the Berliner Tageblatt , the Soviet Government , perhaps intending to vex Great Britain , agreed to restrict manganese mining at Nikopol , to take only $1.50 a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovating the Tiflis-Poti railroad . Those modifications made Promoter Harriman virtual overlord of Soviet manganese production .
