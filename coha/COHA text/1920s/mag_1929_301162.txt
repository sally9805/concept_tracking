Last week artistic Manhattan primped and prinked for a distinguished guest . Ivan Mestrovic was expected to appear in person at an exhibition of his recent sculptures . Then he cabled from Paris where he now has a studio ; he could not come ; next autumn he would bring sketches for two new doors for St. Patrick 's Cathedral in Manhattan . <P> In his show are many wood-panels of nymphs and Nationalistic God-heads . Moses appears in two forms : a bust and a full-length bronze of seething , impassioned aspect . In an era when it is fashionable to divorce art from religion and other such influences , Ivan Mestrovio , bred close to Croatian soil , retains much of the peasants ' religious awe ; infuses his sculpture with that spirit . <P> Recently Sculptor Mestrovio said to a friend who was discussing U. S. art with him : <P> " An American school of sculpture ? No . There is no such thing . Centuries must elapse before the civilization of Europe and of America can be called really distinct . In reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as , reversing the picture , we shall always be learning from you . "
