THE LIFE OF ANNE BOLEYNe secret wedding with Anne , the legalization of the situation and so through the birth of Elizabeth , Anne 's decline in favor and finally to her tragic end in the Tower of London . <P> Her family rose and fell with her . Her father , the Earl of Wiltshire , whose title was the reward of the combined ambitions of his daughter and himself , was " spared the ignominy of serving on the jury " that condemned her to death shortly after the like fate of her brother Rockfort , who had died for the most sufficient reason that Henry desired his definite removal . <P> Through the entire book Anne is sympathetically presented as a being of brains , beauty and unbounded ambition but primarily as a woman of faults and virtues , triumphs , mistakes and jealousies ; she never fails to appear entirely convincing and natural . Whatever the book 's importance may be as a contribution to history it is undoubtedly an interesting one and contains many hours of enjoyment .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
