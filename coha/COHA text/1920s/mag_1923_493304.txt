matter . He has no chivalry . His heroines are neither mediaeval nor modern . They are the fat and foolish ladies that sit on pillowy pulchritudinous clouds and decorate the court paintings of Peter Paul Rubens . Rubens is also magnificent , epic , ? but no one ever claimed for him , per ? sonally , the one and only spot-light and divine honors . Like Whitman he went forward serving a muse who was indeed a thumping giantess , fair , fat , fish-eyed , frail and forty . But she neither demands nor inspires chivalry . And chivalry is one of the indestructible elements that no level ? ling process has ever wiped out of American life . It grows and takes new beautiful forms even here . I remember the birth of the Gibson Girl . We all , high and low , gave her a breathless devotion . Mary Pickford is a person of appalling simplicity , but chivalry is the essence of the United States dream of her . And do you remember the reign of Grover Cleveland 's bride ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ledge and Lucinda Matlock . Chivalry is of the essence of these poems . The daughter of the poorest poor white may win a place in one of our inter-state beauty contests , and the prize will not be for cheap silliness . Even in this there is more austerity , more Athenian grace and more chivalry than in all of Whitman . He assumes that that child can ? not possibly be exquisite . He assumes in her cheapness , slackness . Even our most elementary democracy understands that beauty is a proud , filigree , butterfly humming bird thing . 0 . Henry 's little shop girls , always his heroines no matter how dull , had yet their moments when they were high ? bred . They were all craving honor and worship , the most delicate flowers and honors our tournament could give , and the most filigree crowns in sight . There is no lace in Whitman 's democracy , though there is lace on the Negro baby 's cap , and there are delicate feathers in the war-bonnet of the Indian . Robin Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty soon comes The Covered Wagon . They are both famous films , both essentially democratic ? and breathe from end to end of chivalry , chivalry . All men must be equal , but all little girls must be queens ! We demand in the U. S. A. millions of queens , forever and ever . The root of the matter was in Mark Twain . He wor ? shipped Joan of Arc as some old southern Colonel might worship his favorite daughter or niece . He was after all only an old southern Colonel disguised as a humorist . And in his worship of Joan of Arc all that old chivalry came forth . No devotion of knight to maiden was ever more abject or magnificent . No one is going to cure us of the worship of women who are good and beautiful , by any kind of silly theory , even though it be from the latest medical book . No doctor will ever cure little boys of buying lace valentines for pretty little girls . I have recited in hundreds of high school assemblies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand strong , and giving for my delectation all their yells . But the chivalry was there . The girls were all potential movie queens ? but still queens , and not fat fish ? wives , and it was perfectly obvious the boys feared and loved them . Their athletic contests all have the flavor of Valentine 's Day and the old tournaments combined . And this in the high school ? where young America is at its rawest stage , and really the most " democratic " period of its existence in the Whitman sense . They are children of Robin Hood , and of The Covered Wagon heroics . Whitman will probably be separated from the democracy as Milton and Michael Angelo are . After all both those men had a passionately democratic theory of life , nearer Whitman 's than we will admit . But their " grand style " is a peril to artists and personal imitators . Those who come after them in democracy , in citizenship or in art , must begin again with other models , even if their final goal is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . ' Whitman urges it upon us as food . Sandburg has taken it as medicine only . Whitman will always survive outside the main line of tradition as a gigantic lonely individual . He can not take the central place , for he has no heroines , not even a Juliet nor a " little shop girl . " Anne Rutledge is nearer to being our ultimate sweetheart and the Virgin Mary nearer to being our ultimate Queen than all the glad Jezebels of Whitman . There is not one valentine in him . And Amer ? ica is a land of valentines , white lace valentines . C AN the writing of poetry be taught ? To poets , yes ; to others , no . There , in two sentences , is the question I asked myself at the University of California in January , 1919 , and the answer I brought away in June . When Dean Gayley offered me a class for poetic experi ? ment and assured me complete freedom of procedure , I admitted members according to specimens of their work , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful cases . In this way we reduced the class from seventy-nine applicants to twenty-three members and three irregulars . In a university where a class is often a whole township , I especially realized the advantage of working with a small group . And so there were twenty-seven of us , thirteen girls and fourteen boys , and plenty of blank paper . Every Friday afternoon , for three hours , I gathered my group around a long table . Smoking was not permitted in the university buildings , but I construed that ledges of open windows were not strictly inside ; and sometimes we met under eucalyptus-trees where we needed no window-ledges , and always after hours sections of the class would adjourn to my rooms where there were no rules against smoking . In other words , I wanted the students to be at ease and natural with one another and with me . Soon we were more like a club than like a class , a chapter of widely divergent personalities , enjoying one another . As to enjoying one another 's verse , I followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything was submitted to me and to the class , including verse of my own , anonymously . This lent a latitude and relish to our criticism , both attack and defence , and an interest , both amusing and surprising , to the guesses and confessions at the ends of our periods . Little by little , the lessons developed . The whole class taught and the whole class learned . In America , we believe too often that he snarls best who snarls first . Our humor is largely a humor of fear . It is an ill humor . It is like the spirit-wall a Chinese builds across his gateway . We believe that if we but make a devious entrance to our hearts mirth will not injure us . William James surmised fear of poverty to be the demon that haunted us worst . Surely the next demon in the un ? holy hierarchy is fear of ridicule . Afraid to be gaily ex ? posing our hearts , we laugh at our own good qualities in others and in ourselves . Here is an immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the judges of the P. S. A. Undergraduate Verse-Contest for 1923 , writes me from Vassar : " I seem to run to superficial sub ? jects , and I 'm afraid that flippancy ' is a habit with me . I think that I poke fun at my own verses in order to beat the other fellow to it ! " The Berkeley class on the whole agreed with me that this is no mood in which to write poetry . Ingenuous verse stood its ground with us against clever criticism . I have , noticed , since , that those of our members who were the smartest critics have become the dumbest poets . Their glitter was not gold . It was a glitter of apprehensive malice , a glitter which youth likes to exhibit , mistaking it for a flash of maturity . For the most part , however , we developed a glow rather than a glitter , a warmth of laughter rather than a chill . Like all wise mortals , we knew the need of laughter from the heart . So they smoked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , let 's see . We discussed our favorite poets . We had poets read to us and talk with us : Vachel Lindsay , Ruth Comfort Mitchell , Stella Benson , and others . We heard about Chinese poetry from Kiang Kang-hu and about Serbian poetry from Milutin Krunich . We had many other visi ? tors , who sometimes took part in our conversations . We had one of our irregular members ? Eugenia Buyko , now of Yvette Guilbert 's Company in Paris ? sing Russian songs to us , tell us the English meanings and patiently give us the musical beat , that we might try our hands at lyrical translation . We celebrated in a grove the centenary of Walt Whitman 's birth . We remember the many towns ? people who assembled with us , all sitting on the ground except one old lady so deaf that we fetched her a chair and let her perch craning in the very shadow of the speak- ers . We wondered where they had come from , those Whitmanites whom we had never seen before , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Von . Neu ? mayer told us about visiting the poet at Camden . Sam Hume read from Leaves of Grass . The students had written of Whitman , praising , appraising , dispraising . Their poems were read , of all three kinds . John Cowper Powys , contributing his eloquence , doubted if there had ever been a gathering in Whitman 's name that the poet himself would rather have attended . Powys ended with a quotation from one of the passages prophetic of a just and generous brotherliness on earth ; and a professor from the University of Chicago hissed because he thought the passage had a Bolshevik sound . You can see what fnn it was , all of it . And yet I would never do it again . Not with a new group . The old group met with me further in 1921 , unofficially but regularly . That was different . We were continuing . A new group would have necessitated repetition . No . Only once that " first fine careless rapture .

The powers , I understand , attribute our absence to the fact that none of us held a doctor 's degree . Doubtless each of us regards the young lives we have touched with our own lives as a composite thesis more valuable to himself and to the world than any paper in which we might have been solemnly guilty of wrapping old bones for the university . My brief experience as in ? structor has put me in pitying awe of teachers who have to give out of their creative selves , not progressively , not directly , but the same thing over and over again , through others , others , others , term after automatic term . It has made me wish there might be a form of conscription under which men and women eminent in this or that field of life might ardently and profitably share a year of their development with the young at our universities . There would be a freshness then and a gain for both teacher and . student . But perhaps this passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Already several of the students who had made themselves known to me have made themselves known to others . Three of them have published volumes : Stanton A. Coblentz , Hildegarde Flan ? ner and Genevieve Taggard . Coblentz , four years - ago , pleased us best as a grave young Aesop , rhyming his satire , a member more sober than lyrical ; and I notice him today coming to the fore rather as critic than ' poet . Hildegarde Flanner was a poet from the first and has so proved her ? self , with a deliCately firm touch . Genevieve Taggard , who had written in 1918 verse that compares well with what she has done since , began as a visiting member of the class but was soon a regular attendant and participant . Her work is now impressing outsiders with the emotional turns and subtle rhythms that impressed her smaller audience . David Greenhood , still working off his obscur ? ities , is producing from time to time poems of importance , especially in the Hebrew rhythms which have always charmed him . Eda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to magazine-readers . With her quiet humanness and individual style , she has always seemed to me sure of a place in the poetry of her time , ? thus far , if my other students will forgive me , the most likely of them all . Her translations of songs from the Navajos and Blackfeet are , in my judgment , by all odds the finest Indian poems that have been produced in Eng ? lish , the nearest to the spirit of their source . This may be because Miss Walton grew up among the people she is interpreting : an Indian nurse sang the songs into the little poet 's heart . There are able figures to name in my class , including Vernon Patterson , a later member than the rest . But the last I shall mention now is Idella Purnell , who has not only published her own worthy verse in other people 's magazines , but other people 's verse ( and not hers ) in her own Palms , which she publishes at Guadalaja5a , Mexico . Critics in England as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established verse-magazines for excellence and freshness of content . This is the more remarkable in view of the fact that the young editor supports her venture from earnings in a consular office . She is her own hard-working angel . It is natural for me to feel pride in my poets . On the other hand , as I announced at the start , they were poets , when I met them . I take no credit for their gifts but only for my discernment ; and I have wished to express myself here not ' as their teacher but as their friend and fellow-worker . If there are others who would like to , teach poets and would be interested in more specific advice resultant from my experiences , here it is . I might invest it in Freudian formulas , fashionable prescriptions for genius ; but I prefer it in honest American . Catch your poets young . Not too many of them . Knock the nonsense out of them ? the affectations , the self-decep ? tions , the guesses toward what will seem poetry to others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of English literature . Disabuse them of fear , disabuse them of " modestovanitas , " as Lamb called false modesty . Lead them to distinguish between self-importance and self-confidence , between push and poise , between pat ? ter and poetry , between pretense and truth . Send them outdoors . Encourage them to write in the open : to give terms of themselves to the sky and , as far as possible , those same terms to their neighbor , whether or no the neighbor like it . Show them that there is neither shame nor distinc ? tion but just humanness in their being as ridiculously natural as they are prompted to be . Let them laugh . Let them smoke . Let them say or write anything which genuinely impels them , discovering among one another that honesty is the best poetry . And , above all , after you have made sure that they understand your general and particular judgments , let them , without pride or prejudice , believe their own differing judgments to be as good as yours ? or better . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writing of poetry be taught ? " I answered , " To poets , yes ; to others , no . " And I might add in conclusion , for the un ? observant , that there are more poets born than insurance agents . HERE is a pervasive conviction among those in tellectuals , who disseminate the most persistent pessimism regarding the American scene , that there never has been a civilized body so inhospitable to the creative spirit as the American people . While this is par ? tially true ? truer formerly than it is now ? a similar ' criticism might be directed at other countries . Ask some of the great ghosts of Europe how their ancestral bodies earned the right to live , and how far their particular age and country supported or encouraged the creatures of their imagination . Consider the England of the past century and to what degree that highly endowed cultural aristo ? cracy assisted the energies of Byron , Shelley and Keats ? all three of whom virtually , fled to other climates , and died , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall Francis Thompson , who used to find his nightly cot under the dark , silent , empty , market baskets of Covent Garden . Or examine an earlier era , Elizabethan England itself , and perhaps the spectre of the retired tragedian of Strat ? ford-on-Avon might confide the circumstance which urged him to relinquish the superficial glories of the London stage and to embrace the emblem of a squire on a country estate , where he died in comparative obscurity . It seems to me that too much emphasis is laid on the problem of the American background and too little on the character of a particular artist who , whatever his environ ? ment may be , rises above its unsympathetic elements . One is constantly reminded of Whitman 's famous dictum : " To have great poets , there must be great audiences too . " Where on earth was the great audience which Whitman ad ? dressed ? Surely not in the America of his generation ? Nevertheless , Walt is easily the preeminent figure in American poetry of all time , notwithstanding the superior advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an earlier and later generation . There is clearly a decidedly larger and a much more intelligent quality of readers and listeners at present than the little , scattered handful who followed the growth of the Leaves . Compare the hobo days of Walt with the troubadour jaunts of Vachel Lindsay , Carl Sandburg , Amy Lowell , Robert Frost and the rest of us who undertake periodic recital tours to this or that far-off duster of communities which invite us to take to the road . The average audience is by no means perfect . The road problem is extremely difficult , and its attempted solution is constantly waylaid or inter ? rupted by obstacles , hallucinations and disappointments , with exhaustion ever ready to seize and force you back to the comforts of an easier way . Enthusiasm , however , is always a match for exhaustion , especially when the emo ? tion has been created , quickened and sustained by the eager hospitality , not necessarily mixed with immediate under ? standing , which greets you so generously in successive com ? munities . The growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interests of contemporary poetry has been astonishing indeed , and the effort made , by the members in bringing speakers from places in some cases one , two and three thousand miles distant is well nigh quixotic . Moreover , the organizations are not confined to progressive student bodies . In one quarter of the country , a club of workingmen will send the invitation , in another , a poetry society , or a little theatre or a woman 's club . When one has travelled to certain small manufacturing towns and found poetry groups aggregating two hundred members , one is justified in questioning the absolute pessimism with which adverse critics at present view the American back ? ground . Poetry is not , never was and never can be a precious , self-sufficient , studio affair . Expression worthy of the name may have been composed in the secrecy of an ivory tower , but it can not be locked up ; nor is it an exchange of compli ? ments solely reserved between a man and his material . From this , it must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay with the audience in view . He is possessed by , impelled to struggle with a given ' mood , to express or have it express him ; but he can not remove his hand from the material until the latter is impressed with a final plasticity in which the mood and the form are so closely welded as not to be definable , one from the other . The personal has grown so impersonal that it becomes the spiritual property of any reader , beholder , listener , who cares enough to give himself to whatever the work has in it to give him . He may misinterpret the composition ? he usually does ? but without him , the most immortal lines would rot away . I once prodded Max Beerbohm , who has isolated himself for the ' past fifteen years in a small hermit ? age in the Italian Riviera , as to the secret of his impeccable style and lucidity of utterance .
