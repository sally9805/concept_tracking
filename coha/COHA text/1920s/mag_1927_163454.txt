U.S. Tariff Truce <P> After weeks of argument and negotiation ( TIME , Sept. 19 et seq . ) , President Gaston Doumergue signed a decree granting to the U. S. most-of the low tariff rates which U. S. trade enjoyed prior to the recent French tariff revision . The decree will be effective only until such time as a permanent commercial treaty between the two countries can be negotiated , and this depends upon the findings of the U. S. Tariff Commission 's enquiry into the possibility of reducing the existing duties on French silk , textiles , perfumes and other deluxe articles . It is not thought possible that a treaty can be signed before 1929.
