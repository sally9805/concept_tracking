SOME , but not all , of the ancient fire has gone from political campaigning . We felt a bright spark last week when the Republicans sent a calliope blowing and blowing through Old Man Forty-fifth Street , to advertise a Republican meeting . The lurid red-and-yellow strains sent a circus shiver op our spine , and although we 're a Smith man by inclination , music tends to sublimate our political emotions , and we felt ourself rallying , momentarily , to the prosperous banner of the Good Hoover . What also lured us was the painting on the side of the calliope , next to the banner  --  a large and rather anatomical rendering of a nude lady blowing a trumpet . The legend was COME TO REPUBLICAN MEETING . The inducement seemed to us , in our emotional condition , livelier than any the non-prosperous old Democrats had yet put forward . THERepublicans , when you study them carefully , are really quite resourceful in many things . Look at the way they managed to get Mrs. Willebrandt into the great Northwest . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly changed her into a bridesmaid . And for Laura Volstead 's wedding , tool Naturally you ca n't keep a bridesmaid cut of any section of the country  --  everybody knows that . Still , three times a bridesmaid , never a Federal Judge . UNTIL we saw a squad of them lined up the other day , we had n't quite realized that cameras for making talking newsreels were abroad in the city . Fox- Films , for example , have ten auto trucks in New York equipped to rush out and make a Movietone newsreel on a moment 's notice . The difference between the silent camera and the Movietone machine is that the latter has an electric cable as thick as a snake which it must trail around , connecting it to the sound-recording device in the truck . This umbilical attachment makes the new machine less wieldy than the old machine , and should prove a boon to Gene Tunney and other publicity haters who want to get away from it all . In other words , it is possible to escape from a newsreel Movietone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That we regard as worth knowing . PROGRESS has been made in 1 newsreels , but certain of the old menaces are intensified by audibility . We saw a picture of the governor of California opening a typewriting contest . Fnr years we had sat through similar news events on the screen and had found a sardonic pleasure in knowing that the public characters were uttering platitudes which were spared us because the screen was silent . Not so now . When the governor of California appeared , he said , in a loud voice , just what we feared : " Ladies and gentlemen , as governor of the State , it is with great pleasure that I . . . " With us , life 's goal is still a vast unbroken silence . PROBABLY it could be shown  --  by somebody who knows how to show such things  --  that red traffic lights are undermining - the intellect , morals , and health of all of us . Take a clump of motorists lined up eagerly at any given corner , ready to go but prevented from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good example of repressed ego . Repression , according to the psychoanalysts , is the root of violence . We have computed that a Fifth Avenue bus driver , for instance , is repressed at least seven hundred and ten times a day . At this very moment , throughout the town , there are half a million motorists fretfully waiting for the signal to change . No wonder many of them go home at night and hack their relatives to pieces in time for the late edition of the morning tabloids ! JUST as the sea is drawn mysteriously by the moon , so are all people drawn mysteriously upward by the arts . The colored maid who dusts our apartment is drawn thus upward . A year ago she took to reading hooks from our shelves . She read " Black April , " " Dusty Answer , " and " Sweepings " ( her own selections ) . Recently , she has quit borrowing books and has taken to spending much time just sitting , gazing about the room . Last Tuesday , coming upon her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . " No , sir , " she replied , " I am studying interior decoration and I would like permission to rearrange the objects in this room . " Of course 1S we acquiesced , and while she put the table where the davenport had been , and put the davenport where the Victrola had been , we quietly went about and did the dusting . Somebody's-got to do the necessary work of the world . The Voice Ruth SPURRSPURRED on by the sight of those ED formidable Movictone cameras which we mentioned seeing about the streets , we pursued our study of the device , a little later , in a blocky , concrete building in Tenth Avenue . This is the place where the Fox Film Company makes its sound-screen tests of actors . The three floors of the building are in a hubbub . The frenzy is still high for more and better voices , trained voices , stage voices . Every day three and four  --  sometimes eight or ten  --  Broadway actors talk and gesture for a minute and a half under blinding lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the screen tests made  --  or nearly made . The actor on trial at the time had some ailment of the eyes and could not endure the powerful Kleigs long enough for the ny of " camera , " but the rehearsal gave us a good idea of what a test is like . Strong lights on all sides , a camera in front of a small set , a microphone tilted downward about a foot over the performer 's head ; and a dozen feet behind the camera , to one side , a contraption like a switchboard , at which a man stands wearing earphones . Ile is called the sound man . The actor speaks . " Do n't look down , " says the director in charge . Heads must he kept up to favor the microphone . The actor goes on with his lines . " Hold it up , " says the sound man , listening over the phones to regulate the pitch of the actor 's OCTOBER 2 , 7 , 19 28 voice . " Hold it up " means not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the throat  --  for gutturals are as bad in their way as sibilants . Most actors have little trouble speaking correctly , because the right tone and pitch for the movies is about the same as for the stage . The sound man 's switchboard is complemented by a great box of batteries and a heavy cable swirling across the floor and of course connected with the camera . We gathered that the sound man can listen in on a voice as a physician with a stethoscope listens in on a heart . Camera , switchboard , and microphone are so arranged that the sound waves are changed to electrical vibrations which arc transformed by light and make a record on the edge of the sensitive film . The actors arc all made-up by an expert . Putting on a movie make-up takes about half an hour ( a legitimate " Darling , here 's the bill from the hospital . One more installment and the baby 's ours . " actor can make himself up in six or eight minutes if he has to ) . The result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Screen tests used to be shipped immediately to Hollywood , but now the obviously impossible ones are weeded out here . Virtually all of the first-rate actors , and many of secondary hnportance , have been approached by the Fax people . Financial inducement is high . A big majority pass the tests and many have already accepted contracts . Most Broadway actors screen well , and their voices are pretty generally The commonest fault is talking too fast , but this is unimportant compared to irregular noses , light blue eyes , and the letter " s . " Very light blue eyes are worse than broad noses , for a nose can usually be re-formed by deft make-up , but nothing can be done about blue eyes . It seems that Helen Chandler 's were just on the border line when she passed her test not long ago . One man told us despondently that nothing could ever be done about the letter " s . " Others said the lisp is gradually being tuned out by improvements in the recording device . Ililovictone has for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sectional Feeling A T rush hour , the other day , a sub -- L 1- way guard at the B.M.T. station in Union Square had a time of it with people who were trying to jam into a crowded northbound express , and got the doors closed only after a great struggle . When the train moved off , those Left on the platform heard him murmur : " My Gawd , you 'd think they was in the Bronx ! " Homestead PTO. 25 Oliver Street , where Al 11 Smith lived , is a three-story house of brownish windows and an iron fence . We had expected to find something about it to commemorate its tenancy by the Governor , but there is nothing . No plaque . Not even a new coat of paint . Across the three windows of the first floor run the words " Henry McCaddin , Undertaker . " The doorbell is an old-fashioned handle which , when pulled , squeaks and causes a bell to quaver away on the inside . We rang the bell , and were met by a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he showed us through the place . There was a front room furnished with a table on which stood a vase of artificial flowers , another in which a dozen hearse-covers of various sizes hung about , and beyond it an office where a stout gentleman sat at a roll-top desk writing a letter . This was Mr. McCaddin , and he had just come back from a funeral and felt tired . As for AI Smith , Mr. McCaddin had heard about enough of him . Day and night they were on the telephone , newspaper writers and you could n't tell what , and ringing the doorbells . Why , one reporter had taken a picture of Mr. McCaddin and then brought it around the next day to show him how good he looked . Good be hanged . They had made him look terrible . Mr. McCaddin is for the Governor politically . He is a great governor . Mr. McCaddin knew Al Smith , just as all the people in the neighborhood had known him , though McCaddin would not Iie like a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al . He 'd been too young . Being in the old Smith residence did n't help business any and was , in fact , quite a bother . Why , only the week before a fellow had called him up from Corona , Long Island . His wife had him up in domestic relations court and he wanted Mr. McCaddin to ask the Governor to speak to Judge Doolin of Brooklyn . Mr. McCaddin picked up the letter he was writing . Since we had brought up the subject of the house , why , he 'd just tip ns off to what kind of a place it was . He showed us the letter , which was addressed to a church that owns the property . It concerned a leak in the roof . The previous day a lodger on the top floor had been almost washed out of lied . When the poor fellow went to put on his trousers the next morn ing they were shrunk so that he could n't get into them . Well , Mr. McCaddin put it all in the letter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to print , U. S. Lines OING into a branch of the Public kJ Library , a woman asked a librarian in what department she would be likely to find " Leviathan , " by William Bo-litho .

Wetherfield had about two hundred fine : ( ) Id clocks in his South Kensington house when he died List year . Now about half the timepieces in that remarkable collection are ticking quietly to themselves in Vernay 's , in Fifty-fourth Street , and , as a lady remarked who preceded us into the room , they are " very rare , very interestts ing , very important  --  darling clocks ! " Thomas Tampion , clockmaker to Charles II , made some of them . Daniel Quare , clockmaker to William III , made some of them . They ticked during the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries . They still tick and tell time , and to stand in their tall presence awed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest are the brass lantern clocks  --  small , shaped like a lantern , having but one hand . There are a number of bracket clocks , their beautiful engraved steel dials and carved hands suggestive of the better days , when a clock was made by a horologist rather than by a vice-president . There is a room full of grandfather clocks , very tall , in their cases of walnut , olive , marquetry  --  all hearing the grand old signatures , Joseph Knihh , Edward East , George Graham , Daniel Delander , Thomas Mudge , Vulliamy . Most of them are of that stern period when a clack , to be a clock , had to tell the day of the week , or the day of the month . One we liked particularly showed the age of the moon , as it waxed and waned in a little sky if starry blue . If you are in Fifty-fourth Street and want to know what time it is , or what month , there is no better place to find out . TiVorks Both Ways TWO people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about to light cigarettes when they spied a sign reading " No Smoking . " They were putting their cigar20 OCTOBER 27 , 19 28 ettes away when a hostess came over and said : " You can smoke . That sign is just for the people who do n't smoke . " Somewhere in this there is probably the solution to everything . The Bus Grows Up BEHINBEHIND the Astor Hotel , and he- D the Capitol Theatre , are miniature railroad stations . The tracks arc merely narrow alleys a block long . Each alley is , in places , an inch deep in oil . Heavy motor buses roll in , discharge passengers , take on passengers , and roll out , on an average of one every five minutes . This goes on from dawn until past midnight , at these two stations and at five other big terminals . Everything is done in the Grand Central manner . At the station hack of the Astor a colored man in uniform calls out the towns and moans " All-I Aboard ! " A man named Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns in rush hours  --  sometimes five buses are loading at once  --  hut he always says " train " instead of " bus . " A dozen coaches leave for New Jersey every hour . We also saw the Wilkes-Barre bus off . The passengers were unpretentious people , sturdy-looking housewives , hard-working men , with a few seedy individuals , for cheap rates are of course the chief inducement . Over the $5 sign on the Boston posters  --  the one-way price  --  a sticker reading $4 has been placed . Next to New York , Boston is perhaps the busiest bus centre , for there are eleven buses to Boston every day over the various lines around town . The terminal behind the Capitol Theatre is quite pretentious . The building is in the shape of a great bus . Ticket and information counters keep five clerks busy . Eleven phones ring pretty frequently . There are offices upstairs , and downstairs bootblack and rest rooms , and a Western Union office . The time-table rack is as well filled as the Baltimore &; Ohio station racks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . We had expected here to see one of the three daily buses from Los Angeles arrive , the one due at 5:30 P.M. , but we were told it would he seven hours late  --  the driver had called up from Philadelphia to report delay . Five days and fourteen hours is the scheduled time , but the buses are usually from an hour to twelve hours late . One or two have come in about on time . This coast-to-coast service is the one over which considerable fuss was made when its first coach from Los Angeles arrived here a few weeks ago . As a matter of fact it was merely the first bus " under one management " to make that trip . For a long time people have been going from here to the California city by bus , changing coaches , making various connections . We were deprived of a look at what manner of people ride these cross-country monsters , but officials say there are few complaints . Chairs in the coaches tilt back and form fairly comfortable sleeping quarters , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it all he is allowed to stop over and continue his journey later . Fur distance the L0,1 Angeles trip does not hold the record . The longest bus ride you can take goes from Boston to Vancouver  --  by way of San Francisco ! We did n't hear of anyone who has taken that , but passengers from here to Seattle are not infrequent . Just now that route switches south at Denver and goes by way of Santa Fe , because of snow and cold weather over the northern route , which is by way of Salt Lake City . " We can run you out to Seattle for eighty-nine seventy-five , " a young lady told us . She said THE NEW YORKER ? it would take six days ? " six days and a half maybe . " Buses now run from here regularly to a hundred and eighty main stops every day , they tell us  --  Teaneck , Perth Amboy , Miami , Dallas , Topeka , Toronto , Omaha .

His beat is around Forty-eighth Street where just now he makes suite a hit of change from soft-hearted patrons of " The Singing Fool . " Charlie is in his fate sixties and will show you his medals if , he says , you will come to his room . Failing in that , he will produce a picture of himself wearing the medals , and also display news clips , old and faded , to the effect that about the time of Cleveland 's first presidency Charlie was the champion ice skater of the world . He is thin and wears a sailor 's greatcoat on chilly nights . Hot Dog MITE coming of the Zeppelin should have some simple , if be- ? kited , memorial as the biggest hot-dog event of the year . From Atlantic City and Coney the camp followers of sensation hurried to Lakchurst  --  the hot-dog men , the hawkers of novelties , the balloon sellers . Their stands lined the dusty road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners opened their suitcases on the ground and boldly accosted the sightseers . A tall colored man , who wore a silk hat and sold peanuts , also dispensed jollity like merchandise . We gathered that he followed disaster around the country because the prospect of disaster whets the appetites of people . On this occasion the prospect was an overdue airship , with a hole in one of its stabilizers . The hawkers jollied the crowds . " We/1-1-1 , a loaf of bread and a pound of meat and all the mustard you can eat . " The people were , as the banter of the wise vendors indicated , a gay , ornery , unmanageable crowd , not come soberly to gaze at a new Columbus sailing out of Europe , but to see what would happen when a wounded ship landed . When the ship appeared over the field a captain of marines pleaded for silence . " The landing crew can nett hear the commands , " he shouted . The people in machines tooted their horns in response to this . Noise and confusion added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried the captain . The crowd went right on smoking . The officer cupped his hands and bellowed : " Put out your cigarettes , pipes , cigars ? " The crowd took it up . " Peanuts , popcorn , Coca Cola . " A captain of marines is n't used to that . Against the marine 's protests that someone might he killed , the crowds broke over the guards and rushed for the Zeppelin , as it nosed down , and dust hid the ship from view . There were struggles as the guards fought hack . A man with a banana in one hand and a small American flag in the other was shoved by a marine and fell clown . He kept his hold on the banana . A truck careened across the field , driving into the ranks of people , scattering them , forcing them back . The people were thrilled and made guttural sounds . In the end , order was restored , without serious accident , and a discontented mob scurried off the field . There was a rush for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed , aware that you ca n't sell to disgruntled sensation seekers , but a few townspeople , left with homemade sandwiches on their hands , shouted their wares futilely at the crowds . There was a fight for seats in the sightseeing buses . Persons with return tickets were crowded out by interlopers waving five-dollar bills . The most hard-boiled survived . The scene of struggle was lighted by a glow from a small refreshment stand nearby . The stand 's sign bore an American flag draped over the legend " Hot Franks , Soft Drinks . "
