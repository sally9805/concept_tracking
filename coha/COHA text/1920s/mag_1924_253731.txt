Said Guglielmo Marconi to a learned Manhattan audience in 1922 : " The radio transmission of the human voice across the Atlantic Ocean is a matter of but a few years . " His prediction came true ahead of time . Last week , lecturing before distinguished Romans , the inventor of wireless telegraphy prophesied again . Said he : " High-power stations will soon be abolished . Stations of very low power will supplant them . I have been making discoveries concerning short wavelengths . My engineer and I have patented directional waves like beams of light . " <P> " These short waves , directed in beams , have four advantages over the long waves now in use , " said Marconi : " They use up much less power ; permit greater speed ; are less affected by atmospheric disturbances , thus permitting 24-hour service ; permit the establishment of more stations , without interference . So he foresees the scrapping of all high-power stations and a great reduction in price for commercial wireless messages . <P> Aged 50 , Marconi has already had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that an electric current can pass through any substance-and that it can follow an undeviating course , in whatever direction it may be started , with no need for a wire or other conductor . In 1897 he won a great triumph-he succeeded in sending a message from Queen Victoria , ashore , to Edward of Wales aboard the royal yacht . Two years later he first came to the U. S. , and has visited this country from time to time ever since . The amazing new wireless was used in reporting the 1900 U. S. Presidential elections . <P> Two obstacles only have slightly deflected Marconi 's smooth advance : conjugal difficulties ( in 1915 he married the Hon. Beatrice O'Brien who gained a divorce in April , this year ) , and a commercial scandal in England . In 1912 it was charged that Premier Asquith , Chancellor George and other Cabinet officers had profited improperly through promotion of the Marconi companies . The conclusion of the matter was that blame could not be attached to the inventor and that the Cabinet members had merely been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
