A FIEND was going to be caught by the police . The tabloids said so in big black headlines . But he got the jump on ' the police and came to jail of his own accord . Alas , he was not A FIEND . He was merely a plump , middle-aged man , who sometimes wore a beard and sometimes not , who called himself Dr. Louis Clement and a half dozen other names , who dabbled in chemistry and wanted to be an aviation promoter . He convinced the police that he was not the man who murdered Miss Margaret Brown in Bernardsville , N. J. , by soaking her clothes in gasoline and setting fire to them . Then Dr. Clement faced charges of stealing his wife 's $600 diamond pendant and cashing bad checks . When these minor matters are settled , Dr. Clement expects to take advantage of what he calls " the million dollars worth of publicity " he has achieved by his association with the FIEND and TORCH MURDER case . He is going to get " easy " capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , synthetic gasoline .
