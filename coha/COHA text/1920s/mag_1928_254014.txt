In Manhattan they had it that Marion Nevada Talley would not receive a renewal of her contract with the Metropolitan Opera Company , that if she sang there at all it would be as " guest " and only for two or three performances , that the name Talley made two seasons ago by an uncritical press would no longer be a big money-maker in Manhattan . The Talleys answered back-to the effect that quite the contrary was true . Signer Gatti-Casazza , master of the Metropolitan , seized another opportunity to remain silent . <P> In San Francisco tongues wagged when word went out that Maria Jeritza would arrive next September with the Salome of Richard Strauss , dance there for the first time in the U. S. her version of the Seven Veils . The echo spread as far as Manhattan . Perhaps the Metropolitan would relent now , let Salome into her own repertoire . She is , according to Jeritza , not a bad girl , just a little wild . But the Metropolitan board , it seems , refuses to be convinced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , firmly anti-Salometic.
