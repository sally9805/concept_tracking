Joseph Caillaux thought he could settle the French debt to the U. S. in seven days . And he failed . Giuseppe Volpi spent twelve days with Mr. Mellon and his associates trying to settle Italy 's debt to the U. S. And he succeeded . <P> There is small doubt that the time element worked in Count Volpi 's favor , but there must have been other factors as well which enabled the Italian negotiator to convince Secretaries Mellon , Kellogg and Hoover and Senator Smoot as well that Italy deserved the terms she got-the most lenient which the U. S. has granted to any debtor nation , not excepting Belgium . <P> The Negotiations . There were no clearly developed offers and counter offers as in the negotiations with the French . The two sides got together and gradually worked toward a settlement on the basis of Italy 's capacity to pay . When the terms of the settlement were within reach , the Italians made an offer , the terms of which were carefully veiled from the public . Journalists got the idea that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this a counter offer was made by the Americans of about $2,500,000,000 . From these two offers the final terms were arrived at . <P> The Terms . The original borrowings of Italy were $1,648,000,000 . Interest ( unpaid ) on these borrowings was supposed to be at 5% , making a total due of $2,138,000,000 . The interest accrued and unpaid was however scaled down to 4 1/2% to Dec. , 1922 , and 3% from then until last June , cutting out about $100,000,000 of interest and making the present total of the debt $2,042,000,000 . <P> Payments will be made on this debt as follows : <P> YEAR ANNUAL PAYMENT <P> 1 to 5 $5,000,000 <P> 6 to 15 14,000,000 to $18,000,000 <P> 16 to 25 20,000,000 to 26,000,000 <P> 26 to 35 31,000,000 to 38,000,000 <P> 36 to 45 43,000,000 to 52,000,000 <P> 46 to 55 56,000,000 to 67,000,000 <P> 55 to 62 73,000,000 to 80,000,000 <P> These payments add up to a total of $2,407,000,000 for the 62 years . They are officially calculated as repayment of the principal with interest at rates from 0% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last seven years ) , but this is done only to save the face of those politicians who have clamored for repayment of every cent of principal . It might just as well be calculated that no principal would be repaid but that interest of from % to 4% would be paid for 62 years . <P> Comparisons . The fairest basis for comparing the various debt settlements is to discount the future payments to be made by the several countries . Even in this way different results can be obtained by using different rates of interest , but the following comparison uses substantially 4% , the approximate rate of interest paid by the U. S. to its own bondholders . On this basis the British will pay about 75% of their debt ; the Italians 25% . ( The French offered to pay 40% , and were asked to pay 60%. )
