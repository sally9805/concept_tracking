Surgeon General Hugh Smith Gumming of the Public Health Service , who guards the health of the nation 's 120,000,000 people , made his annual accounting to Congress last week . <P> Smallpox , plague , yellow fever , cholera and typhus are prevalent in various parts of the world . Ships , immigrants , animals ( especially rats ) may bring the pests into the U. S. Dr. Cumming 's small brigade of doctors , dentists , sanitarians , pharmacists , nurses and specialists inspected 21,631 ships , more than 2,000,000 passengers , more than 2,000,000 seamen at domestic , insular and foreign ports . Result : only seven cases of smallpox , one of leprosy and two of typhus reached U. S. quarantine . <P> Neither here nor abroad were there any pandemic outbreaks of disease last year , and in no country with a modern public health organization did pestilences spread . India continues to harbor bubonic plague , as do French Indo-China , China , Algeria , Madagascar , Nigeria , Siam , Argentina , Ecuador , South Africa , Greece , Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year-from ground squirrels . <P> Persons traveling to Siam , Cochin-China , China , and Iraq must still beware cholera ; along West Africa yellow fever ; in backward Europe typhus ; everywhere smallpox . <P> The U. S. had more smallpox than any other country of the world , except India . This situation irritates Dr. Cumming , an habitually serene Virginian . Chidingly he wrote to Congress : <P> " It is difficult to understand why this condition is allowed to continue year after year . A large percentage of the property in this country is insured against loss by fire , and a man who fails to provide for his family by taking out life insurance is censured ; yet , when smallpox is introduced into a community in the United States it usually finds many victims who have never been vaccinated and others who have not been vaccinated for many years . Nearly 34,000 cases of smallpox in the United States in the calendar year 1927 testify to the neglect of the people to utilize vaccination , the known means of preventing the disease . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Public Health Service for more than 30 years and its surgeon general since Woodrow Wilson appointed him so in 1920 , calls the health officers of all the states to a conference . Most of them attend and from his quiet , pointed talks get stamina to suppress disease within their districts . But six or seven states are so careless of their epidemiological work that their statistics are rarely considered in Dr. Cumming 's survey of the nation 's health . In the two score and more who habitually report , last year there were 4,000 needless deaths from measles , 7,000 from whooping cough . Infantile paralysis was a scourge chiefly because its prodromal symptoms are ignored and its after-effects ignorantly fought . <P> Dr. Cumming made a special point of telling Congress about the fundamental research the Public Health Service is making in various diseases-cancer , tuberculosis , goiter , leprosy , trachoma , undulant fever , typhus fever , Rocky Mountain spotted fever , pneumonia , venereal diseases . <P> Most Congressmen know Dr. Cumming personally . Few men are better known in Washington . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his Public Health Service , he gets that something very quickly .
