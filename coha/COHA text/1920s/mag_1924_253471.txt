Another " big operator " has been developed this Spring by the sharp rise of grain in the Chicago Board of Trade pits , - Arthur W. Cutten . His dealings in grain this Spring are said to have netted him $1,800,000 . <P> Born in Guelph , Ontario , in 1870 , Cutten was successively a clerk in a hardware store , a brokers ' messenger boy , a trader in the grain pits and member of the Chicago Board of Trade , and a dirt farmer and cash grain merchant . Earlier in the year , in the belief that a natural bull market in grains was ahead , he bought corn options at 75 cents a bushel . Last May corn prices slumped badly and forced Cutten to buy heavily to sustain prices . But this proved a blessing in disguise , for bad weather injured the crop , and the scanty prospective supply rose in price in consequence . After predicting $1.00 corn , Cutten saw it sell at $1.10 to $1.14.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
