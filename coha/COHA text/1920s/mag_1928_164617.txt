( See front cover ) <P> Some day the New York or Chicago police may tyrannize over honest citizens in such outrageous fashion as to move the Congress of the U. S. to investigate . Such an emergency might cause the City of New York or of Chicago to call General John Joseph Pershing to the post of Police Commissioner , in hope of restoring public confidence in policemen . Conceivably a great lawyer and statesman , such as Charles Evans Hughes , might say , in speaking of the application of a police third degree to some young woman : " Every father of an American girl sees in the affair of Miss X- an example of police methods which might be applied to his own innocent daughter . " <P> Last week the exact counterpart of all these fanciful suppositions occurred in London . The newspaper of world 's largest circulation in any language , the London Daily Mail has been devoting 16 columns per day to the story . <P> Byng for Pershing . The police force in which the British public has lost confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yard . The national hero who consented to become Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , last week , is the great " General Lord Byng of Vimy Ridge , " or , less colloquially , Julian Hedworth George Byng , Baron Byng of Vimy , Viscount Byng of Vimy and of Thorpe le Soken , recently Governor General of His Majesty 's Dominion of Canada ( 1921-26 ) , and grandson of Field Marshal Sir John Byng who fought and conquered with the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo . <P> Never before has a Peer of the Realm been called to the Police Commissionership . <P> The retiring Commissioner , Sir William Thomas Francis Horwood , who offers " age " as his excuse for resigning , is 59 . Lord Byng is 65 . <P> Simon for Hughes . Not the Congress of the U. S. but its political equivalent , the Parliament of Great Britain , has appointed the Extraordinary Tribunal ( TIME , June 18 ) which was probing , last week , into the suspected employment of third degree methods upon a young woman , Miss Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great British Liberal , Sir John Simon , highest feed London barrister , veteran statesman , and Chairman of the Indian Statutory Commission , said : " Every father of an English girl sees in the affair of Miss Savidge an example of police methods which might be applied to his own innocent daughter . " <P> The British public knows with absolute certainty that Miss Savidge is an innocent young woman . She has submitted herself to the scrutiny of the person from whom she had most to fear , the Medical Examiner of Scotland Yard , and has been certified to be a " virgo intacta " - fact duly chronicled by the whole British press . <P> Not one spinster in a million would offer equally good proof of her own innocence .
