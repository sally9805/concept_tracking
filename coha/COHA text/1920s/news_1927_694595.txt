txt Mrs. Margaret Lilliendahl and Willis Beach were sentenced toi-v to serve ten years at hard labor in the State prison at Trenton for the killing of the woman 's husband . Dr. William Lilliendahl , on Sept. 15 . The sentence was imposed here this morning by Supreme Court Justice Luther A. Campbell , who denied pleas for mercy and leniency by defense counsel . The widow and her admirer got . the maximum penalty for voluntary manslaughter of which a jury of five women and seven men convicted them on Thursday after twenty-two hours of deliberation . Mrs. Lilliendahl wept openly as Robert H. McCarter , her senior counsel , made an earnest plea for leniency . When she arose to hear the sentence she trembled . She made no effort to hide /ler tears as she was led away . Beach was less demonstrative . He came into court smiling his customary smile , but on his way out , facing the ten-year term in prison , his mouth was set hard and his eyes showed fight and shock . Judge Calls It " Murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factually and ' legally " the crime was " murder in th first degree . " " For persons learned in the law . " he said , " we have no question that this crime was murder in the first degree . It seems . to me ' that my plain duty would not be performed unless I exacted the extreme penalty or near it . " Despite the conviction and sentence , . Beach and the widow back in their cells in the county jail , con tinued to assert their innocence of the slaying of ? Dr. Lilliendahl. who was shot to death in a lane off the Atsion road near Hammonton . Defense counsel made . no motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence . This " newly discovered evidence " had involved the . expectation of confessions from two negroes that they , as Mrs. Lilliendahl ' testified , had killed the doctor . The failure to make the motion , Mr. McCarter announced , was due to lack of time to " crystallize " the evidence necessary for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to fight to the limit to get a Del , trial for the couple and tr. , to prove that Mrs. Lilliendahl 's story of the killing by two negroes is true . Calls Verdict Inconsistent . Unable to offer the motion for a new trial , Mr. McCarter in his request to Justice Campbell for clemency for Mrs. Lilliendahl , laid the basis of his appeal not on evidence , but on his interpretation of what went on in the juryrnom during the long deliberation . He argued that the woman and Beach should have been convicted of first degree murder or nothing . He could not escape the conclusion , he said , that some jurors had believed Mrs. Lilliendahl innocent . He declared that " the circumstances indicate that the conclusion of guilt of manslaughter ' must have been ? psychologically based on the theory that these people were not guilt : : of murder , but had been indiscreet in ' some ways . " This apparent inconsistency , he contended , did not justify the extreme penalty . .

Justice Campbell said that he could not . be concerned - with suppositions regarding ? what had been in the jurors ' minds . He , too , was convinced , he declared , that the crime was murder in the first degree , but the jurors apparently knew what they were about and he would impose the ten-year sentence . ? Defense May Seek Bail . With the prisoners back in their cells , the defense counsel at once began preparations to fight the case . Mr. McCarter was non-committal concerning details of the fight , but Mr. Hedges said the procedure would involve either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion for a new trial on the basis of new evidence . , Mr. Hedges admitted that the " confessions from two negroes " he had hoped to have in court had failed to materialize so far . but he indicated that the expectations of the defense along this line , had not been exhausted . He also announced that as soon as a course was decided on and the first steps necessary were taken . an application for bail would be made . It has been made known . that Prosecutor Louis Rspetto will oppose " bitterly " any effort to have Beach and Mrs. Lilliendahl admitted to bail pending the appeal . Whether or net ; - the pair receive any support their attack on the conviction and sentence it is unlikely that they will enter the State Prison until after Christmas . Sheriff James Cimino has twenty days to remove them there and he has declared that if they want to stay in his homelike jail for the time they can do so . Mrs. Lilliendahl said this afternoon that she was arranging to have her Christmas dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach also wants to stay here . The sentence proceedings this morning were swift and were held before a crowd considerably smaller than that present at the nine days of the trial . Mr.-McCarter , addressing the Court , " After the rendition of the verdict the other day I asked for a breathing spell to permit the ? investigation by us of information that we had obtained and which we deemed important to an application for a new trial . In the limited space of time s ' then we have not been able to crystalize this information in such form that I.deem proper to present to your Honor . Defense Has Six Months ' Time . " At that time I also erroneously expressed the opinion through my lack of familiarity with criminal cases that I would be compelled to make an immediate motion for a new trial . I.have since conic across a statute showing that we have six months in which to make the application for a new trial . All that remains for me to say is a word on the ' extent of sentence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justine , Campbell interrupted to ex plain-that his desire ? was . that such an application for a new trial should be filed ' . before him in . Atlantic Connty , preferably on the opening of , his next session here on Jan. 10 . He said , he made this suggestion because . he : believed . Many . persons , . Including newspaper men , might desire to be , present : Mr. McCarter then launched intohis plea . " ? " " I noticed the other day after the rendering of the verdict , " he went on , - " that the Assistant Prosecutor , , with jaws set ? and eyes sparkling , . ' announced with vigor that , - he thought the Court should impose the extreme limit , and I assume that his attitude is still unchanged . ? In my argument to the jury I expressed myself as believing that this case was either one of . murder in the first degree or was one in which the defendants were innocent . " The manslaughter verdict is inconsistent with the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a conviction for libel or other . crimes . I can not escape the conclusion that lit was a compromise verdict . Penalized for " Indiscretion . " " Ntre can not escape the conclusion that the length of time taken by the jury for deliberation indicates two things  --  first , that there was a cent siderable element in the jury who believed in the innocence of the two , defendants ; and , second , that there was an element who believed in their guilt . These two elements were irreconciliable , and in order to reach a conclusion they were united in the idea that whether guilty or not of murder the defendants were guilty of indeseretion in writing clandestine letters for which they should be pun , ished and that that punishment should be the penalty for manslaughter . " Feeling that , I do not believe that this is a case for the extreme sentence for manslaughter . I am not quarreling with the views of the Assistant Prosecutor , but he also can not escape the conclusion that at least a substantial part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendants of murder . I say that in reaching the judgment a sentencing Judge must exercise you should not shut your eyes from the fact that some part of the jury did not ineviL tably disbelieve the innocence of Mrs. Lilliendahl . " And so , not in a hysterical way , or just to say something , but earnestly and solemnly , I ask your Honor to bear in mind the circumstances indicate that conclusion of guilt of manslaughter must have been psychologically based on the theory these people were not guilty of murder , but had been indiscreet in some way . They did find these people guilty not of writing letters but of manslaughter . " The verdict only charges they had been indiscreet and should be pun ; ished for that. ; therefore the punishment should be very much less than the extreme penalty . " Prosecution Asks the Limit . ! Mr. Hinkle was brief in his reply . He denied that the jury had returned its verdict on the basis of the letters exchanged by Beach and the widow . " The issue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two people , in connection with the murder Charge and not on the letter writing , , ' lie said . " The jury did not accompany its verdict with a recommendation for mercy , and I repeat that the full penalty should be imposed . " Here Mr. Hedges rose to speak for Beach , and Justice Campbell apologized for having , as lie said , " overlooked " the young mail . Mr. Hedges was almost as brief as Mr. Hinkle in urging merry for Beach because of his ate and his heart- ailment .. Then justice : Campbell spoke , saying he . had- given a great deal of consideration to the question of sentence . Judge 's View , of . the Case . ? . " Now , why that jury found the degree . of'this.crime to be manslaughter ' I do n't know , " : Justice Campbell said . " Anything ' I might say , would be ? a pure guess . ? The only way in which that might be . learned  --  would , be ? for one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and-. none of them has done- so , tome , at any rate . " It may well . be , and yet I do n't knew , that there did exist some sort of , doubt as to the giltof these niefendantsde Perhaps ? the jurors felt that-they should give them the benefit ' of this doubt . Of course , if the evidence did not warrant such a verdict the ? ; is not the time to review it . I can not review it here . " Ofecourse , under the law it was for the jury to decide , what the crime was . I must conclude that the jury understood my instructions .. So I must assume that the jury understood the issue and passed upon it . The thing that stands out is that they found these defendants guilty . " For persons learned in the law , we have no question that this crime was murder in the first degree . Factually and legally it N.'as - murder in the first degree . It seems to me that my plain duty would not be performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Now the penalty is a fine of not exceeding $1,000 and not exceeding ten years in the State prison . I can not justify my action without enacting the maximum sentence of penal servitude , and this is the sentence I am about to impose . " Beach Is Sentenced First . Justice Campbell turned toward Beach . " Willis Beach , stand up . " he commanded . The little man rose to his feet a bit shakily . " Willis . Beach , " he said . " a jury has convicted you of manslaughter and the judgment of the law and of this Court is that you serve a terns of ten years in the State prison at Trenton at hard labor . " Beach sat down heavily . Mrs. Lilliendahl was directed to rise . Mr. Phillips rose with her . His arm was behind the woman to catch her should she fall . She did not fall , however , but stood there with her hand on time table , trembling . The Justice imposed the same sentence and she . too slumped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burst into tears . A few moments later , Beach was hurried away and Mrs. Lilliendahl followed , crying bitterly . The Justice had a little more business to dispose of and that included the dismissal of two indictments charging Mr. Hedges with obstructing justice and - spiriting away a man wanted for a crime " in connection with the disappearance of : Beach ' durino- the investigation . Mr. Hedges said he did not believe he had done any wrong , but offered his apology if he bad offended the dignity of the Court by what he termed " perhaps overzealousness . " The Justice then formally nollc pressed the two bills . " Innocent , " Widow Declares . the jail , Mrs. Lilliendahl continued to weep for sonic time . She asked ' for her son and was told he would visit ; her in the afternoon . He did not ' come , hewever . Later , after telling of her plans to have the boy with , her for a Christmas dinner in a special room in the jail she sent out this message through Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have . been convicted and sentenced for a crime of which I am innocent . I will go to prison with a clear conscience and hope God will give me strength to carry on . God knows I am innocent , that we are both innocent . " Beach sent out a similar message . State 's Witness Assailed , Charles M. Phillips , personal counsel for Mrs .. Lilliendahl , issued a statement attacking the availability of the testimony of Sam Bark and Harry F. Sanderson and going on to say : ay : " Sanderson made four statements on the witness stand . The , jury saw fit to believe him on one statement and not to believe the witnesses for the defense denying the crime and establishing an alibi for Beach . " The testimony of Mrs. Lehman and Martin Lashley corroborated Mrs. Lilliendahl 's account of the murder in every way . I am at a loss to understand how the jury arrived at-the verdict finding the defendants guilty of manslaughter . In spite of the verdict of the jury . ' I still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe this faith will be justified in the future . " Bark was the man who testified that Beach had told hint in Baltimore that he had killed the doctor . Sanderson , a salesman , in his first appearance on the stand made only a partial identification of Beach as the man he saw at the scene of the crime , but later he resumed the stand to identify Beach positively . Mrs. Lehman and Lashley were defense witnesses who told of seeing negroes as described by Mrs. Lilliendahl at or near the lane that day .
