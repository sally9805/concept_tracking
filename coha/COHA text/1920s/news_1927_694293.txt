txt Mayor James J. Walker of New York fought another losing battle with time today . Despite the best of intentions , his international reputation for " punctual tardiness " suffered no serious setback on his second day hi the French capital . Having arrived for an impressive wieath-layin ? ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier precisely half an hour behind schedule , and at exactly 2 o'clock for a 1 o'clock luncheon with the American and British correspondents , the Mayor continued to lose ground relentlessly to the hour-glass until late in the evening ? very late , in fact ? and finally returned to the Hotel Crillon on what his friends insisted was New York time . " Anyway , " observed the Mayor with that ' shrewd philosophy which lies hidden beneath an exterior of mirth and unconcern , " Paris is a great place to be late in . No one seems to mind when you come , ? so long as you come . " Nothing could be closer to the truth than that , certainly so far as Mr. Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris and its ways , Paris likes " Jimmy " and his mannerism just as much . " What a wonderful Parisian he would make , " laments one wellknown Parisian writer tonight in extolling New York 's Mayor . " This poetic sporting Mayor who writes his own songs would soon become the greatest figure in the capital . " At Tomb of Unknown Soldier . If , as the Mayor himself said to the newspaper men , he had too often been used as a synonym for jazz because he refused to use dignity " to cloak his ignorance , " he nevertheless demonstrated to official Paris that he can be that dignified and correct figure which he refuses to admit he is . The ceremony at the Arch of Triumph was impressive and eminently fitting for the Mayor of the world 's largest city . Despite his delay in arriving , the Mayor descended from his Motor car calmly . His attire was faultless ? morning coat , top hat , black shoes , spats and the conventional wing collar and gray tie . He was received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of municipal officials , including M. Delsol . President of the Municipal Council . With the Mayor were Mrs. Walker , Senator Dowling , Major Deegan and Herbert Adams Gibbons . The group passed slowly between solid lines of Municipal Guards standing rigidly at attention , Mayor Walker carrying a bronze wreath . When he reached the simple tomb Mr. Walker laid the wreath at the foot of the grave , while Senator Dowling laid another on the other side . Then a wreath of roses entwined with the tricolor of France and small American flags was placed below and the Mayor and Senator Dowling stepped back and with bowed heads observed the customary two minutes of silence . It was a graceful tribute and the hundreds of Frenchmen who witnessed it were deeply moved . Sang the Old Songs . Mayor Walker then went back to his hotel -- it was now 12:30 ? and , changing his clothes , attended to a large amount of personal business . After his luncheon with the correspondents the Mayor departed  --  two hours late  --  for a shopping tour of the Rue de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tore himself away from the correspondents , for after the coffee the luncheon guests gathered around a piano and sang the songs which were dear to the Mayor 's heart when he was plain " Jimmy " Walker . Some one reminded him that he had engagements to buy things . " Oh , let 's forget them ! " he said and gave the signal for another song . He finally got under way , however , and by 6 o'clock had acquired-a number of Parisian articles , including two of the latest-style pipes . Between the ceremony at the tomb and the press luncheon the Mayor paid a hurried visit to the American Legion activities under way in Paris . He inspected the American Red Cross first aid station , took a quick look around the Knights of Columbus hut and accepted a package of the cigarettes which the Knights were giving away and then went on to the Salvation Army but . There he ate a newly baked doughnut and pronounced it " bully . " He followed this with a drink at the Knights of Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but popular with the visiting veterans because all the soda fountain drinks are on tap . " This is fine , there 's no excuse for any Legionaire being dry if Ws bar holds out , " said Mayor Walker with a sly smile . As to the Lord Mayor of London . " What has the Lord Mayor of London got to do except to be on time at luncheon , " remarked Mayor Walker after his arrival an hour late for the luncheon with the correspondents . President Slocombe of the Correspondents ' Association observed through his red whiskers that the last time he presided at a luncheon given to a Mayor the guest of honor was the Mayor of the largest city in the world , in fact , the Lord Mayor of London . Furthermore , he added , he was on time . Today , he said , the guest of honor was " the Mayor of the so-called largest city in the world " and he was late . Mayor Walker was in good form , despite a hard night at Montmartre . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that all human sins may be condoned , even that of being late , but as for whiskers , that 's a man 's own fault . " The Mayor then delivered his observation regarding the Lord Mayor , and added : " Sure ! What has he to do except to be on time , even if he does dress up like a hero in a Shubert musical comedy and bring along a couple of guys with - maces and swords that he never uses ? " Mr. Walker assured his hearers that , even if he was taken too often as the personification of jazz , he really was a fellow " more serious than his face portrayed him . " He was a man who was always himself and if , with that , he could be of public service , he would not consider that he had lived in vain . The Mayor 's speech was a great success , being equaled only by the reception given to his personal rendering on the piano of his plaintive query : " Will You Love Me in December as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the evening festivities by the former Ambassador to Spain , Alexander P. Moore , and James L. Blackmer . They accompanied him to a boxing bout , where he saw a French boxer , Emile Pladner , win on points over Frankie Ash , an Englishman . The Mayor , cheered by the ringside crowd , made an extemporaneous speech , which was applauded by the French , who did not understand it , but supposed it was all right . After the fight Mayor Walker , with Mr. Moore , withdrew for a quiet chat and refreshment and , according to his friends , retired early  --  in the morning . Tomorrow at noon Mayor Walker will visit Mme. Nungesser , mother of the lost French airman , who , with Coli , disappeared into the mists of daybreak on May 8 and was never heard of again . The Mayor will present to the grief-stricken mother a check for 1,000,000 francs , the proceeds of a New York benefit performance at the Roxy Theatre . This gesture is already the subject of widespread comment in the press and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parisian program . At 1 o'clock he will lunch with the American Club and afterward he will be accorded an official reception at the City Hall , the elaborateness of which has only been equaled by those to Lindbergh , Pershing and Wilson . ?
