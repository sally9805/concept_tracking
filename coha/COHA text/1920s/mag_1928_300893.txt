<P> No matter who is elected President , his Secretary of State will not be Frank Billings Kellogg . Secretary Kellogg did not announce this news . But he could not very well prevent the realtors of Santa Barbara , Calif. , whither many a good Minnesota man retires to bask in retirement , from confirming news that Frank Billings Kellogg had taken a lease of indefinite duration on the Mission Canyon home of Mrs. Robert Cameron Rogers , beginning March 1 , 1929.
