The Rt . Rev. Ignacio Valdespino , Bishop of Aguascalientes , Mexico , a good Roman Catholic , died last week in San Antonio , Texas . The Most Rev. Arthur Jerome Drossaerts , archbishop of San Antonio , pronounced a funeral sermon at a solemn requiem mass in San Fernando cathedral . It was a pronouncement not limited to laudations of the dead man 's character . Archbishop Drossaerts pointed out that Bishop Valdespino had belonged to the colony of Catholic refugees who had fled to San Antonio from the Mexican government . He commented on the poverty in which many of them have died , saying that the Most Rev. Jose Mora y Del Rio , archbishop of the City of Mexico , had three weeks ago " been buried on charity . " From the pathetic , Archbishop Drossaerts proceeded to the critical : <P> " Liberty is being crucified at our very door , and the United States looks on with perfect indifference . Despotism seems to have become popular amongst us . Are we not sending endless goodwill parties to Mexico ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men whose hands are simply dripping with the blood of their innocent victims ? . . . The ominous silence of the American press and pulpit is not understandable . . . . " <P> Archbishop Drossaerts , as he said these words , was speaking to people whose minds were filled with a thousand small and bitter pictures . He and they could remember the stories that are told across the border , of the malign and treacherous determination with which Mexican officials pursue Roman Catholics . In circulation are the stories of : <P> Maria Guadalupe Chaires , from Ciudad Victoria , who was captured and asked where the priest and certain other Roman Catholics were hiding , and who when she refused to tell , was torn to pieces by soldiers . The soldiers began by tearing off her fingers and continued their mutilations until the woman was dead . <P> The Rev. Pablo Garcia de Jesus Maria of Aguascalientes , who , as he was leaving for exile , gave absolution to a dying man and who was for so doing mutilated by his guards in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped off the train . <P> A priest , who when examined by a reporter for El Eco de Mexico , Los Angeles , showed proof that he had been purposely inoculated with the bacillus of leprosy by the agents of Calles ; other priests who have been inoculated with disease under the pretense of vaccination . <P> The Mother Superior of the nuns of Ejutla , who was shot to death , and the Sisters of her charge , who were delivered to the soldiery for bad purposes . <P> Countless other priests killed , Catholics caught and tortured , villages burned , rape , murder and happenings of like nature . <P>
