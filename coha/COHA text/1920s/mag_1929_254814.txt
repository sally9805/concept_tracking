Good " Papa " Joffre was snoring . He has a touch of water on the knee , nowadays , and he tires easily . Therefore after a morning stroll in his Paris garden last week the beloved old Marshal climbed stiffly and painfully upstairs , sank with relief into a large armchair , dozed off and soon was snoring . <P> Seeing her husband thus at peace , Madame La Marchale , frugal , set off to market , taking along her cook to carry the market bag . Then for a time there was no one in the house but " Papa " Joffre , so fast asleep that he did not hear light steps on the porch , the creak of the front door which Madame La Marchale had accidentally left unlocked , or stealthy footfalls which soon indicated that someone was prowling all over the house . Surely it could be no sneakthief . Who would steal from lovable , heroic " Papa " Joffre , who saved Paris at the Battle of the Marne ? <P> After a time the Marshal waked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife returned , followed at a respectful distance by cook and market basket . In the basket was an old cock , just right for an old man 's chicken soup , a bottle of wine as the Bible says " for thy stomach 's sake , " and some cheap but wholesome vegetables , for heroes are seldom rich . <P> " Mon dieu ! " cried Madame La Marchale as she saw the half open front door and rushed frantically within . The house had been ransacked . Silver , jewelry and securities to the value of 50,000 francs were gone-not much in the U. S. , scarcely $2,000 , but much to grizzled Joseph Joffre . When excited gendarmes came , the Marshal , no longer his fat self of younger days but very thin and trembly , exclaimed , " Whoever burglarized my house was no Frenchman . That , I could not believe ! "
