MOSE You better not drink too much out o ' dat pore little river , white boy , or you 're goin ' to drink it dry . Mose and Skelly go out left . Little Red comes in from the right , looks round a moment casually , then lifts a hand and Edna enters after him , dressed as a man . She is well disguised and would not be readily detected unless by her voice . LITTLE RED We 're all right , kid . I 'll start making a fire and you just lie around and do n't say anything . If anybody comes along start smoking cigarettes so you wo n't have to talk . Let me do the talking . Red collects kindling and Edna stretches out to watch him light the fire .

Next morning I was pretty wobbly , and when we went down to the yards to hit the stem he decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out and rifles my change drawers . Left me lying right between the tracks and all the time she was raining cats with blue feathers and green tails and when I come to I was wetter'n the Monongahela River . Well , sir , I lays still and the trains rolls all around me . If I 'd a stretched out my hands they 'd a been on the rails  --  then I 'd a been a bum without grub-hooks . Naw ! He did n't make a very good impression on me ! RUBIN Certainly is a dirty guy . SKELLY I 'll tell the cock-eyed world he 's dirty . BILL What y ' going to say to him if he shows up here ? p. 14 SKELLY You talk to him , will you ? I 'm gonta be in conference . MOSE Boys , they 's a whole army comin ' down the creek . A pause . Baldy , who has a livid scar across his face and Hopper , who walks with a crutch , come in from the right , followed at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better dressed than the others . He sits down at the right without speaking . BALDY By Judas Priest , everybody in the world is here . What is this , the Democratic National Convention ? BILL Naw  --  this is the United Clam-bakers ' Union of Alberquerque , New Mexico . RUBIN This is the Amalgamated Chamber of Commerce of Beautiful Ossining on the Hudson . BALDY Say , cookie , is there any hot dogs for me , or is there gonta be a hot-dog scandal in this administration ? LITTLE RED There 's gonta be a hot-dog scandal if I do n't get any , because I bought ' em . BALDY Bought ' em like hell . LITTLE RED Yes , sir , bought ' em with money . And what 's more I was n't expecting any young mass meeting of the international intelligentsia of the world when I laid in supplies . Did n't you guys have any luck at all ? p. 15 BALDY Hell , no . Every back door I batters the woman says she 's fed seven already . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bum ! I 'll put you on the bum ! " and she sets two dogs on me . LITTLE RED All right , you , come and get it . The newcomers , all save the Snake , share in the food . BALDY Wait a minute , Hopper , give the Snake a chance . He pours coffee for the Snake . BILL By God , it 's the Snake ; how are you , Arkansas ? The Snake looks at Bill , looks away , spits deliberately . A gloom falls over the session . RUBIN to Bill.You must know him well . Next time you better set that to a tune and sing it . Maybe he 'll hear it . BILL I do n't give a damn . Baldy carries a cup and a sandwich to the Snake , who accepts them without thanks . RUBIN to Baldy , as he returns . . Which way , ' Bo ? BALDY Judith Basin . Goin ' to try the apples this year .

OKLAHOMA Fine  --  I do n't need any . I do n't need anything but a lift out of this little half-acre of hell . Anything running out of this place tonight , or do you die here waiting for a train ? RUBIN There 's about a hundred west-bound empties going by in about fifteen minutes . OKLAHOMA Well , then , that 's one soul saved , because if I 'd had to stay here all night , I was going to hunt up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . This ai n't a town . It 's a man-trap. p. 17 LITTLE RED You better have a bite , friend . It 's a long way to Wolf Point . OKLAHOMA taking a proffered sandwich.Thanks . Yes , sir , I 've rode on every railroad from the Florida Belt Line to Salt Ste. Marie , and I 'll be god-damned if I ever saw a country where the towns was so far between and few in a hill . And as for turning a trick , my God , they could n't scrape up enough change between Minneapolis and Idaho to start a chain grocery store . No wonder there ai n't any yeggs in North Dakota . You 'd have to walk a thousand miles to find a safe big enough so you 'd have the heart to blow it . What y'all doing here anyway ? RUBIN Hell , we came out for the harvest and there ai n't any harvest . BALDY Apples is good in the Judith Basin . OKLAHOMA Oh they are , are they ? Well , roses is good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Let the married men do the work . That 's my motto . I 'm through . MOSE Me too . OKLAHOMA gently.Hullo , who said anything to you , nigger ? Did you hear me speaking to you ?

OKLAHOMA suddenly menacing.Then keep your face shut , will you ? Mose starts to speak . Oklahoma raises a hand . Mose cringes good-naturedly and is silent . Now after this you listen , see ? MOSE Ah heahs you . OKLAHOMA conversationally.God , this certainly is a collection of funny faces . I ai n't seen nothing like this since I left the home for decayed newspaper men back in City Hall Park . If this is what they call the floating population , it 's a God 's wonder the country ai n't drowned . All desperate men , too , ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ; well , judging by what 's left of your shoes I guess maybe you are . A man 's got to have some ambition , and if he ca n't think of anything he 'd like better'n work , why he might as well work . Harvestin ' , apple-picking , milking cows , that 's the stuff ! Keep the country going ! Put your backs into it ! Now , boys , all together , swing them picks , lift them shovels , tote them hods ! Yes , sir , here 's a little earnest band of working Gideons hitting the long road from heaven to hell and asking nothing better'n three meals a day and a job at something they wo n't get nothing out of ; here 's the goddam scions of the first families of West Hoboken and South San Francisco , descended from seven generations of bastards on the mother 's side and tracing their male ancestry in a straight line to more drunken sailors and ministers ' sons than you could count on an adding machine . Here 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the United States without ever kicking back . Here 's a little Kiwanis Club of patriotic outcasts , voting a resolution to uphold the social order . Sic ' em , Tige , they like it . Oh , sweet Christ ! Come to Jesus and join the working class . Workers of the World , unite ! You have nothing to lose but your annual trip to Florida . p. 19 BALDY You a wobbly , friend ? OKLAHOMA Me a wobbly ? Is that all you got out of it ? Ask me something easy . Ask me if I 'm a Y. M. C. A. extension lecturer or a Pavlowa finale hopper or the deputy inspector of the American Society for the care and prevention o ' children . BILL low.Who 's the guy , anyway ? OKLAHOMA And I do n't want anybody askin ' who 's th ' guy behind my back , you get that ? When I want you to know who I am I 'll tell you . SNAKE Listen , ' Bo , what th ' hell do you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . OKLAHOMA Listen to me , ' Bo . You speak to me like that once more and I 'm going to deposit a swift kick right where you part your pants . The last guy that talked up to me was carried into the corner drug store for first aid and his face wo n't ever be the same . Snake rises . BALDY to Oklahoma.You better draw it mild , friend . You 're talking to the Arkansas Snake . OKLAHOMA So , it 's the Arkansas Snake , is it ? Sorry I left my card case home , I 'm sure . This is an unexpected pleasure . As for me , I 'm Oklahoma Red , and when I speak somebody jumps . Snake hesitates ; there is a pause. p. 20 BALDY Aw , that 's different , that 's different . Say , you two wild men ought to know each other . Boys , this is some little flush excursion from now on . I guess nobody can say this gang ai n't good company with a couple of steppers like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stow it . BALDY Come on , now . He raises his cup . Drink to friendship ! Here 's friendship , one and all . Several cups and cans are raised , but the Snake and Oklahoma do not move . Come on , set down and be sociable . You two yeggers do n't have to fight just because you 're both he-cats . The train 'll be along in five minutes anyway . There ai n't enough time for a good fight . Come on . OKLAHOMA to Baldy.Turn off your gab . You talk like a Singer Sewing Machine agent . Baldy sits . I ai n't specially needing to kill anybody . If the Snake here wants to set down , I will . BALDY Take it easy , Snake . Remember we 're going somewhere . SNAKE seating himself.That suits me . OKLAHOMA And what th ' ' ell was all the row about anyway ? He sits. p. 21 BILL rising. Well , gents , all , I guess I 'll hit the grit . RUBIN rising.Guess I 'll beat it with you . HOPPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here 's the place to get it . BILL We 'll get it , do n't you worry . OKLAHOMA Do n't vamoose on my account , children . I ai n't poured any juice since last Christmas . I slipped the dicks clean in Atlanta and they do n't know my mug north of Iowa Falls . RUBIN Oh , that ai n't it . We 're  --  OKLAHOMA Sure it is . I know . That 's straight , though . You can say your prayers and go to sleep easy . I ai n't no bait for bulls around here . BALDY No , nor us either . BILL All right . He and Rubin sit . OKLAHOMA Anybody got a watch ? RUBIN She 'll whistle in plenty of time . OKLAHOMA Somebody give us a little tune , then . This jungle 's as dead as Sunday afternoon in a reformatory . Hey , you , Angel-face , can you sing ? Edna shakes her head. p. 22 BALDY Who you travellin ' with , kid ? Edna waves hand . Huh ? EDNA Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him alone . BALDY Sure he 's all right . LITTLE RED We 're heading for Frisco for the winter . Met up in Duluth . BALDY You two ai n't been on the road long , kid . It takes a lot of guts for green kids to beat through this country . LITTLE RED Shucks . You got to start sometime . OKLAHOMA How old are you , kid ? LITTLE RED Me ? Twenty . OKLAHOMA Naw , Angel-face . EDNA Fifteen . SKELLY That 's all right , young fellow , you 'll get whiskers yet . RUBIN Some guys do n't shave till they 're ' damn near of age . Snake rises and comes round the fire to a point where he can see Edna . BILL Hell , I was all blossomed out at fourteen . BALDY Yeah , I 'll bet you was a beauty . And how old is the little one now ? p. 23 BILL Any time you want to know , you try looking at my teeth . SNAKE to Edna.Hullo , baby ! LITTLE RED What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lost its daddy ? How 's the little hoochi-hoochie , huh ? LITTLE RED Say , what 's eatin ' you , huh ? SNAKE Go on ! I guess I know a girl when I see one , whether she 's got clothes on or not . Hullo , puss-in-boats ! LITTLE RED Girl hell ! SNAKE Go on ! Nice little travelling companion you got , Red . This is sure one grand camp . All the conveniences  --  including lady friends . Come on , kid , warm up . At a sign from Red , Edna leaps to her feet . Red and Edna attempt to escape , but both are quickly pinioned from behind . BALDY holding Red.Keep your shirt on , boy . SNAKE Well , what do you say , what do you say ? EDNA Well , what of it ? SNAKE You certainly are one little lotus-flower , kiddie . I 'll bet you can love like hell . All the men have half-risen , watching Edna. p. 24 EDNA Maybe I can . SNAKE We 'll show ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDNA No , we wo n't show ' em . SNAKE Oh , wo n't we though ? EDNA No we wo n't . When I get through talking to you , dearie , you 're going to depart like there was a can tied to you . You can let go of me . I wo n't run out on you . Her arms are freed . I 'll tell you why I 'm going out on the freight . I 'm travelling in pants because Red here went down to the station to buy a couple of tickets for No. 4 and ran across three deputies in the woman 's waiting-room . And they was waiting for me . BALDY Hell , we better beat it . Snake . EDNA Yeah , I thought so . And anybody else that wants to go had better get out now . Baldy and Snake start to go out right-followed by Hopper . OKLAHOMA What 'd you do , kid ? EDNA All right , I 'll tell you what I did  --  and then see how many of you stick around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back of Williston , over there , there 's a farmhouse with a cottonwood windbreak in the front yard . Maybe you saw it . It 's near the railroad bridge . That 's where I was born . And if you want to take a run back there and look you 'll find a dead man sitting in the dining room in the dark because there 's nobody to light a lamp for him . Sure , I 'll tell you how it was . You see , my mother died , that 's the beginning of it , and then I did n't know any better , so I went wrong . I went wrong with my own step-father . You do n't need to believe it if you do n't want to , but that 's straight . p. 25 OKLAHOMA Hell . EDNA Yes , it was hell , but I did n't know it at the time . Then I found out a few things and ran away from home and the first thing I knew I was in a sporting house in East Grand Forks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to a hospital , and when I told the matron who got me into trouble she says , " My God , why did n't you shoot him ? " And I said , I guess I will . So I met up with Red and we got here this morning and I went out to the cemetery all alone and knelt down beside my mother 's grave and told her what I was going to do . I said , " Mother ; I hope you can see me . I 'm going to kill your man . " Well , he 's dead , and we 're getting out of here together , and we 're going so far it 'll take a dollar to send us a postcard . And then we 're going straight , both of us . Now , is anybody anxious to follow my trail ? OKLAHOMA Do n't you worry , girlie . You 're all right . If anybody starts putting bracelets on you , there 's going to be trouble ahead of ' em enough to wreck the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old bleeding-heart . You ai n't the only passenger on the Great Northern . Now I 've got reasons for going out on the train tonight and it just happens I do n't want to be travelling with candidates for the death-house . Damn sorry to inconvenience you , I 'm sure , but Red and his Angel-face 'll have to wait over for the next train . p. 26 OKLAHOMA You wait over and see how you like it . The girl 's coming along . SNAKE I say Angel-face takes the next train . OKLAHOMA Oh , that 's orders , is it ? He leaps up suddenly . Snake puts a hand in his coat pocket . Take your hand off that gat , Snake . Boys , you see that ? Bill and Rubin edge up behind the Snake who withdraws his hand . Now we know where you got it , see ? And listen ; you ai n't safe with a gat . I do n't feel comfortable travelling with you while you nurse that little blue-iron . If you want to ride with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like hell I will . OKLAHOMA I 'll give you one-half a split second to cough it up . SNAKE Come on , take it away , why do n't you ? Bill and Rubin leap at Snake at the same instant , twisting his arms behind him . Oklahoma lifts the Snake 's gun and searches him for other weapons but finds none . OKLAHOMA Remember , this is redeemable at the end of the line . If you ever need it , ask for it at the lost article window when you get to Spokane . Maybe they 'll tell your fortune for you . SNAKE to Bill.I 'll put somebody on the blink for this . p. 27 BILL Aw , do n't be so personal . A stranger strolls in casually from the left . In the growing darkness he looks much like a hobo . FIRST STRANGER Well , boys , how 's everything . OKLAHOMA Fine , just fine . How 's yourself ? FIRST STRANGER Never better , thanks . OKLAHOMA Glad to hear it . FIRST STRANGER You fellows staging Union services tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , do n't it ? FIRST STRANGER Well , that 's all right . I do n't mind . Going to sleep here ? BALDY Oh , no .

The stranger goes out left. p. 28 HOPPER Geez , he 's friendly . BALDY Ah , you think so . He 's looking for somebody . Like hell I 'll stick around here . He 's too affectionate . BILL Come on , ' Boes , throw your feet . There is a general move to the right . A second Stranger enters from left , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break for it .

As Chief rises  --  @x Scene : The interior of a moving box-car . A low monotonous clanking of iron on iron is heard as the long train pulls heavily up a grade west of Williston . In the distance an ungreased wheel screams , faintly heard . The sliding door is half open and reveals a slowly moving blackness outside . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near it . At Rise : Blind Sims , an old man with white hair and beard , sits motionless on a heap of burlap bags in a corner at the right . A brakeman 's lantern burns beside him .

Do you know what we 're going to do with him ? BALDY Lynch him , I say . OKLAHOMA Shame on you , Mr. Prosecuting Attorney , for that illiterate suggestion . No , sir ; we got ta do everything decently and in order . The sentence is exile to Russia . Little Red loses his sweetie to the custody of the court and gets off the train . Bailiffs , do your duty ! Open the door . p. 56 LITTLE RED What ! OKLAHOMA Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't mean it . OKLAHOMA savagely.The hell I do n't mean it . BILL Hey , Judge , we 're on a trustle . Say , we 've left the main line . RUBIN We 're crossing the Missouri , and it 's deeper than the Gulf of Mexico . If we kick him off here he 'll have to swim . OKLAHOMA sitting.Hell , that 's too bad . The court is visibly affected . He wipes away a tear . BILL We 'll have to wait and put him off on the other side . Geez , we switched at Fort Union . OKLAHOMA That being the case , tie him up . BILL as he and Rubin arrest Red.Stand still , you red-headed flea ! You want me to bash you one ? LITTLE RED I warn you , if you dump me off this rattler there 's going to be murder done when I catch up with you ! BILL Aw , take it in fun , Nick , take it in fun . LITTLE RED Take that in fun ! He socks Bill viciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard ! He and Rubin tie Red , the rest laughing heartily . They carry him back and dump him on the sacks near Edna . BALDY at door.Hey , Snake , this rattler 's beating it south . We must have switched at Fort Union . SNAKE Yeah ? Well , see what you can do about it . HOPPER Hell , this is all wheat-growin ' country around here . OKLAHOMA What the hell do you care where you 're going ? HOPPER Well , now I 'll have to walk across the Rocky Mountains . OKLAHOMA The court 's adjourned . He rises and kicks the keg . Boys , is anybody going to save me from being a solitary drinker ? HOPPER as they cluster round.Lemme at it ! BALDY Here 's the Kangaroo Judge ! BILL Here 's the lady friend of the Kangaroo Judge ! HOPPER Here 's the ward of the court ! RUBIN Here 's to fallen women ! OKLAHOMA Wait a minute ! That 's a good skoal ! He walks over to Edna , cup in hand . Cutie , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ' em . He drinks. p. 58 EDNA Do n't talk to me about it . Try the Florence Crittenden Home . OKLAHOMA You know , sweetie , I got a suspicion you 're a little wicked . That 's a compliment . EDNA Very sweet of you , I 'm sure . OKLAHOMA Now I 'm as wicked as hell , and if you and me was to be wicked together , my God , how wicked we could be ! EDNA I 'm one of these modern women , judge . I claim the right to pick the guy I 'm gonta be wicked with . OKLAHOMA You know , darling , you 've got the old judge going . Now , you 're the ward of the court , and I do n't want to cause any talk , But God damn his Honor , he 'd like to break the Mann act and the Sullivan law with you . EDNA You ai n't any Valentino you know . OKLAHOMA Listen , kiddie , Little Red is deserting you . He 's getting off the train as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be ? You know who it 's going to be . EDNA Who 's it going to be ? Why , the Snake . He 's a better man than you are . OKLAHOMA Who says so ? EDNA The Snake as good as spit in your eye back in the camp  --  and what do you do ? You make some clever remark about not needing to kill anybody at the moment . Lucky for you you can talk . If you could n't talk yourself out of trouble you would n't live long . p. 59 OKLAHOMA Lady bird , the only reason I did n't have a go with the Snake was that he was scared to raise his eyes higher'n my shoe strings . EDNA You better whisper that , because he 's looking at you . OKLAHOMA turning.All right , Arkansas ; the lady wants a fight . Get up . Arkansas rises . Angelface likes the silent kind . She likes ' em silent as the White House after election . When I get through with you , pardner , you can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be the peace of the dead from then on . SNAKE Do you always start a fight with a gat in your pocket ? OKLAHOMA tossing the gun out the door.There it goes . Moreover , if you 've got any last statements to make or any fond farewells you 'd better get ' em over with . They call you the Snake , do they ? Well , I 'm a snake-eater , see ? I eat ' em alive . When a snake bites me it 's the snake that dies . SNAKE Go on and preach your sermon , because there wo n't be any at your funeral . You 're drunk , you bag of guts , and I 'm going to tear the wind-pipe out of you . Oklahoma swings and misses . The Snake leaps for his throat and Oklahoma gets a similar grip . They fall and roll over , Oklahoma ending on top . He chokes Snake into submission , then pauses thought-fully , one hand still holding his adversary by the shirt front. p. 60 BILL What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill him or not . If I do n't kill him he 's going to try to kill me sometime . And if I do kill him , it makes a mess on the floor . BALDY Aw , come on , be a sport . Let him up . Ukie takes out his ukelele and begins tuning it . OKLAHOMA All right , Baldy , you take care of him . Maybe you better give him a drink . He goes to the keg , and helps himself . Baldy carries a drink to the Snake , who sits up . Are you licked , you sidewinder ? SNAKE No , by God ! OKLAHOMA Oh , yes , you are . I 'm going to sit by my girl . He goes to Edna and sits at her feet . Now , little sweet dreams , have you got a good word for Oklahoma ? He lays his head in her lap . What do you say ? EDNA smiling at him.It ai n't a bad state , judge , even , if you come from it . OKLAHOMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't need to be afraid of me . You going to give the old judge a kiss , Angel-face . Come on , kid , show ' em how you do it . p. 61 EDNA Wait till I sing you something , judge . Say , Ukie , play that one again . The one you was just playing . OKLAHOMA That 's right , sing to me , Angel-face . Sing " Say it Is n't True "  --  you know that one ? EDNA I guess I know that one . OKLAHOMA Sure , everybody knows that one . There was a swell little dame used to sing that back in Des Moines . Sing it , kid . Ukie plays . EDNA singing.Sometimes when you 're far away ; Sometimes when you 've been gone a long while , Maybe half a day.Maybe half a mile , I look out the windowAnd it looks like rain And I think very likelyYou wo n't come here again . During song , Red backs around , Edna gets Skelly 's knife from Red 's pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joins in song . EDNA AND UKIE But say it is n't true , Oh , say it is n't true , Do n't tell me you do n't love me , Tell me you do.Sometimes , oh every once in a while , I forget how you kiss me , Forget how you smile ; Then I think someone elseHas cast a spell over you  --  But say it is n't true , Oh , say it is n't true ! p. 62 UKIE rising.Now then , come on in , you pikers ! ALL singing.Oh , say it is n't true , etc . BALDY Say , that 's God-damn good . Let 's do it again . There is a trampling overhead . BILL Sh-h ! There 's the brakeman ! BALDY More likely dicks . There is a pause , then the trap lifts . BRAKEMAN on the roof.My God , there 's enough bums down there to fill up the Grand Canyon . DETECTIVE I 'm going down . BRAKEMAN You better not . DETECTIVE Ah , hell , it 's a bunch of stiffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap . DETECTIVE looking round.This is sure some sweet little crowd . He looks at the keg . And you certainly punished the booze . Well you 'll pay for that , see ? You 'll pay for that . Shell out . That 's a ten dollar keg and you can dig up ten dollars or get off and take a little drink of Missouri River . He walks to the door , turning his back insolently . Oklahoma , who has risen , suddenly kicks the detective out the door . As he falls , he clutches at the jam and his revolver flies from his hand . Red grabs it from Hopper , who has picked it up , and retreats to a corner with Edna. p. 63 OKLAHOMA Now I know what the carp-fish eat at the bottom of the Big Muddy ! HOPPER Hey , judge  --  he 's got the gun . OKLAHOMA Hel-lo ! LITTLE RED Ha ! Now what do you say we have that trial over again . Bailiffs , do your duty , Oklahoma 's getting off the train . OKLAHOMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's loaded . LITTLE RED Come on , sing us something , judge , sing " Say it Is n't True . " OKLAHOMA Why you goddam little fool , do you think that gun 's protection ? You think you can bust through the drag-net they got out for you two ? You ai n't got a chance . Why you ai n't got a chance against me . What do you think that damn little gun 's going to get you ? Just five minutes more , that 's all  --  just five minutes more . BILL Hell ! He lit in the mud ! We 're across the river ! Beat it , youse . Train bangs to a stop . The gang jumps off . Mose , Sims and Ukie remain . UKIE Now there 's going to be hell to pay  --  you better beat it , nigger . MOSE What did ah done ? p. 64 BRAKEMAN appearing at door with detective.Well , what are you doin ' here ? UKIE We ai n't with that gang . We paid for this ride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going south ; let ' em ride to Fairview . BRAKEMAN All right , you 're doin ' it . They 'll get ' em at Fairview all right . The two disappear . MOSE Hey , white man , Ah 's goin ' no'th ! Ah don ' wan na go south no mo . ' Exit . LITTLE RED Let 's get out of here , kid . This place ai n't healthy . Not that way , they 'll see you . Come on ! Train starts . EDNA So long , Ukie ! In end-door . UKIE Good-bye , Juliette . Exit Edna , then Red . SIMS Who 'd she go with , Ukie ? UKIE She 's going north with a little red-headed guy . Ukie plays the ukelele . Sims drowses . Skelly still sleeps in the corner. @x Scene : A deserted claim shack on the edge of Montana . There are two windows in the rear , a door at the left . No furniture has been left in the place save a stove which stands in the corner at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel stands on one side of the table , a fish keg under it . Time : It is just daylight the next morning . At Rise : Edna is still asleep on the floor at the extreme right , her face to the wall . Little Red , sits bolt upright , the revolver on his knee , evidently guarding her . At the left , near the door , the hoboes are stretched out in heavy slumber . They are all here except the four who remained in the box car . Baldy stirs , yawns loudly , lifts his head , and looks at red . BALDY Beautiful morning , Mickey . LITTLE RED Yeah , ai n't it , though ? BILL Shut up , will you ? BALDY There , there ; did we wake him up ? BILL What the hell 's wrong with you ? It ai n't mor'n four o'clock . I got to get my beauty sleep , ai n't I ? BALDY Well , you need it , all right . BILL All right , shut up and let me rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , will you take a look at Red here ! He 's been standing guard all night , and expecting trouble any minute . Red , you do beat hell . Did n't you get any sleep at all , kid ? p. 66 LITTLE RED I do n't need any sleep . I used to be a six-day bicycle rider . Anyway , why in hell did n't you hoboes look up a claim shack of your own ? We found this joint first . OKLAHOMA We did n't know you was in here . And for the matter of that there ai n't another shack within two miles and it was raining and darker than a bushel of black cats . If you had n't lit the candle we would n't have found you in a thousand years . It certainly is hell to keep you awake like that . Why did n't you go to sleep , you poor fish ? We was all asleep . RUBIN Who was awake ? OKLAHOMA Aw , Red 's been awake all night , with the blue-iron all ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now ai n't that terrible ? He wo n't be hardly any good today keeping them late hours and all . You 're going to lose your job with the chippie , kid , if you go and get out of condition . BALDY That 's all right , Mickey ; do n't let ' em kid you . Any time you need it , I seen a sign back in Minot , Lost-Manhood Restored . They do it cheap back there . LITTLE RED If they could do that maybe they could grow hair on that solid ivory of yours . Why do n't you try ' em ? BALDY I do n't need hair on my head . I got it on my chest . p. 67 HOPPER getting up to look out window.Jeez , it 's morning ! BILL Aw , go to sleep . BALDY If you want to sleep , go on outside . There 's a million acres of prairie out there with nobody using it . Pick yourself out a soft acre and go to sleep in the middle of it . BILL Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I wake up I 've got ta have breakfast and where am I going to get it ? BALDY Ah , the country 's lousy with jack-rabbits . Catch yourself one . The way you beat it away from the rattler last night a jack-rabbit would n't have a chance . HOPPER sounding on the flour barrel with his knuckles . There 's somethin ' in this . BALDY God , he 's hopeful . I suppose you think it 's full of hot muffins . HOPPER reaching into the barrel.It 's flour . Can anybody cook ? BILL I do n't want any of that . I 'll bet it 's full of boll weevil . HOPPER No , it 's all right . There ai n't even been mice in it . BILL Well , then , there must be something wrong with it . p. 68 RUBIN investigating the fish keg.Boys , we 've got some rare old pickled herring here . OKLAHOMA See if you can catch ' em . I 'll bet they 're playing tag in there . RUBIN Come here , Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good ? RUBIN Come over here and smell ' em . BILL I do n't have to go over there to smell ' em . I can smell ' em here . OKLAHOMA Put that lid back on before they escape . BALDY looking into the flour barrel.Let me see that flour . That 's all right . That 's No. 1 hard , F.O.B. Minneapolis . I can make something out of that . BILL Where you going to get your soda ? BALDY What do you know about soda ? If you want to be intelligent ask me where I 'm going to get the firewood . BILL I 'll bite , where you going to get it ? BALDY Them as wants breakfast will step out and forage for ' it . BILL I knew there was a catch in it . Is that all the better of a cookie you are ? p. 69 BALDY I got to have some water , too . Get the hell out of here , you bunch of bindle-stiffs , and let me work . RUBIN Say , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch you . BALDY All right , I 'll get it myself . He takes a pail from the table and hands it to Hopper . Here , Hopper . Kicks Bill out of door and exits . BILL You think he 's sore ? RUBIN No  --  just the old woman 's way . He looks out the window , then steps out . HOPPER I 'll bet you have to walk a mile for water in this country . He goes out , followed by Rubin . The Snake turns over , stretches himself , takes in the situation and goes out . OKLAHOMA to Red.You do n't have to sit there all day with the gun in your lap . LITTLE RED How about last night ? OKLAHOMA Well , what about it ? You 're off the train , ai n't you ? The sentence was carried out by what the life insurance agents calls an act of God . Everything 's been working out fine for them that loves the Lord , including you two babes in the wood . Put your gun away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you waiting round for ? OKLAHOMA Because I want to talk to you . LITTLE RED What about ? OKLAHOMA Do you know why I was going to kick you off the train ? LITTLE RED Do I seem to be going blind ? OKLAHOMA I 'll tell you , I did n't want you to make a damn fool of yourself . LITTLE RED I 'm certain obliged . OKLAHOMA You think I 'm kidding you . Well , I 'll admit I liked the little girl , but hell , I 've seen a mort of fan-tails in my time . You know what they 're good for . You do n't want to tie yourself up with one of ' em , especially one with a record . Catch ' em young , kid , treat ' em rough , tell ' em nothing . LITTLE RED Did you hear me asking for any advice ? OKLAHOMA Well , you 're just a God-damn fool , that 's all . LITTLE RED Is that all you had to say ? OKLAHOMA That 's all . LITTLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . He rises . Edna stirs and sits up , brushing back her hair. p. 71 EDNA Lend me your comb , will you , Red ? LITTLE RED Sure . He hands it to her . EDNA Where 's all the procession ? LITTLE RED Out for tinder . A pause . EDNA What were you two talking about ? LITTLE RED Oklahoma was just backing out the door . OKLAHOMA You know , for kids that 's supposed to know your way around , I do n't know as I ever come across a pair of idiots as simple . First you croak an old guy and then you set off across country for a honeymoon with half a dozen detectives tied on behind you instead of old shoes . I do n't get you at all . EDNA It does sound funny when you put it that way , do n't it ? LITTLE RED Well , life 's funny , anyhow , Oklahoma . You 've got a lot to learn . OKLAHOMA Yeah , life is certainly funny ; and the whole world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . You break all the rules of the game and you do n't even play to win . EDNA No ? OKLAHOMA The first rule in making a getaway is Scatter . The dicks know Angel-face is travelling with a red-headed go-bragh . They know Red is travelling with a lady friend . If they find you together you incriminate each other . If you want to get away , why do n't you cut loose ? p. 72 EDNA If they get their nickel-plate on me it 's good night , no matter who 's with me . OKLAHOMA All right ; but if they see you with Red they spot you as easy as chalk on a door , and if you 're with somebody else they 're off the scent . And Red here , he 's walking right into the sheriff 's lassoo . Along with you he 'd an accessory . Going it alone he 's just any red-headed kid , and Christ , there 's plenty of them . LITTLE RED Aw , we 're onto your little game . You can get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're just a Goddamn fool . You think you 're noble or something . You probably saw a movie somewhere and went completely nuts . You 're nuts over little Edna and she 's nuts over you and she 'll have the satisfaction of ringing you in on a short session of blind man 's buff out behind the Minot jail-yard . You 're cuckoo . You two are going to have a grand time being buried together and all . LITTLE RED Have you ever been hung very much ? OKLAHOMA No . LITTLE RED Well , if you have n't been hung , you must have got away . That 's what we 're figuring on , getting away . OKLAHOMA Where to ? LITTLE RED Ask another . p. 73 OKLAHOMA Oh , where are you going ? You 've got to get out and get out fast . EDNA How about Medicine Hat ? OKLAHOMA Yeah , that 's all right . How 're you going to get there ? EDNA Cut north to the Soo and cross the border in the day coach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't ride on this one any more . Yeah , you 'd probably make it . And then what ? EDNA Medicine Hat . OKLAHOMA And then what ? Then Red goes to work for the gas company , huh , or selling bath tubs to the Norwegians . You 'd settle down in one of them three-for-a-dime cottages and keep house . They 're a fine church-going crowd up there and they 'd take to you like hell . You 'd have a wonderful time . How long do you think you could stand it ? EDNA There 's land up there OKLAHOMA Or else you move into a claim shack and spend the winter dancing to keep warm . EDNA Have to go somewhere , you know . Ca n't be nowhere , like this . OKLAHOMA And then you 'd start raising kids . Oh God ! Do you call that a future ? How long d' you think Red 's going to last at that ? He has n't spent more'n three days in any one town since he was old enough to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to talk all day ? Sign off , will you ? OKLAHOMA I 'll tell you what we 'll do , kid . I 've got a small roll left . We 'll let Red try the Soo on his own and you and I 'll pick up a bus somewhere and never stop till we get to Colorado Springs . I know a hang-out down there and I 'll show you the time of your life . If you 're caught with Little Red you ruin him . You do n't want to do that . LITTLE RED Wake me up when he quits . Aw , bull ! EDNA And what if I 'm caught with you ? OKLAHOMA Well , you wo n't be , for one thing . And if you are  --  I ai n't a walking identification tag like that guy . EDNA I guess maybe  --  I ought to do it . LITTLE RED Do what ? EDNA I ought to give you a chance . LITTLE RED Do you mean you 've been listening to that kangaroo ? EDNA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want to go with him ? EDNA Yes , I  --  I guess so . She rises . LITTLE RED No , you do n't . He rises . And if you did , do you think I 'd let you ? I 'll fill him as full of holes as a barrel of doughnuts first ! Go on out and take a running jump in the Missouri , you hog-shouldered rag-picker , before I feed you a plate of ammunition ! p. 75 OKLAHOMA looking at them in a puzzled way.Would you do that , Red , would you actually do that ? LITTLE RED You try any monkey-business and you 'll find out ! Hell , you talk about slick Micks , if you ai n't the heavyweight soft-soaper of the world I 'd like to meet the guy that is ! My God , you almost sold that face of yours to a girl when she had another one to pick from ! And say , that face of yours would be a lovely thing to live with ! Think of looking at that across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy means it . You know I ca n't make you out , Mickey . I thought you 'd probably be damn glad to get rid of her . As a matter of fact I thought I was doing you a favor . If you was looking for dangerous baggage you could n't pick up dynamite any more likely to send you to your Happy Hunting Ground than her . And here 's your best chance to shake loose , and you do n't want to do it . LITTLE RED No , damn you , no . D' you get that ? OKLAHOMA lighting a cigarette.I do n't know as I ever knew a case like it . He sits down . Do you know what I think 's the matter with you two ? There is no answer . Oklahoma speaks quite seriously and speculatively . You must be in love . p. 76 LITTLE RED I do n't care what you call it . OKLAHOMA still pondering.Yes , sir ; I 've often heard about it , but I never saw it before . I knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . That 's what it is . Well , that being the case we 'll have to make the best of it . Medicine Hat , huh ? Medicine Hat I can understand your liking her I liked her the first time I got a flash at her pan  --  but this life-term stuff  --  oh , hell . LITTLE RED I told you you had a lot to learn . OKLAHOMA to Edna.You do n't want to come with me ? EDNA I 'd do it  --  for Red . You see , I 'd do anything for Red . But if he wants me to stick around  --  why , you know where you can go . Where the Pope told the Cardinal . OKLAHOMA Aw , use a little diplomacy , Angel-face . Even a judge has feelings . The old judge , damn his whiskers , is inclined to be lenient . There 's something in the way you kids look at each other that gives him a jolt . A couple of wild-eyed idiots that wants anything the way you do  --  probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you 'll like it after you get it  --  but that do n't make any difference . If you want to go to Medicine Hat why it 's a deal ; you 're going . You 're going if the gang has to stage a massacre in Wolf Point to pull the bulls off the track . Stow the side-arm , Red . And shake . He holds out his hand. p. 77 LITTLE RED hesitating.No , I do n't like you , and I wo n't shake with you . OKLAHOMA That 's all right . I do n't hold it against you . If I was to count the number of guys that do n't like me or my fingers I 'd have to be a thousand-legged worm . You 're probably right , Red . I 'm a low-lifer and not to be trusted . But , damn it all , you 're an amusin ' little cuss , Red , and I kind of take to you . EDNA Grab the mitt , Red . He 's a good bet . LITTLE RED Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun in his pocket and takes Oklahoma 's hand . Instantly Oklahoma twists his wrist in an iron grip , whirls him round and catches the other arm , holding Red like a vice . OKLAHOMA You see , I got you easy . You see , Angelface , Little Red was right . I 'm a low-lifer and not to be trusted . I talked you right into a trap and you 're busted . I 've got you . On the other hand , speaking contrary-wise , I do n't want you . I ai n't even taking your gun away from you . I would n't spoil your picnic for country sausage and wheats , and God knows I 'm hungry for breakfast . You two are emigrating to Canada if I have to carry you across the dyke in a basket . He releases Red . Now , will you shake hands without being told ? p. 78 LITTLE RED Why , you double-breasted son-of-a-buck ,  --  no . OKLAHOMA All right , kid . Bill and Rubin enter , Rubin carrying kindling , Bill carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I found a coal-mine ! OKLAHOMA A coal mine ? BILL Right ! A coal mine ! Growing right out of the ground ! OKLAHOMA Why , Bill , that 's grand . That 's simply grand ! I did n't think you had it in you ! RUBIN laying the fire in the stove.I tell you that 's lignite . BILL Well , it 's coal , ai n't it ? RUBIN They call it coal . BILL It 'll burn , wo n't it ? RUBIN Some people has been able to set it on fire . BILL Then what 's the difference ? RUBIN What 's the difference between a duck and a mud-hen ? That 's the difference . Oklahoma lies down and smokes a cigarette . BILL Hell , if it 'll burn I 'm going to make a fire with it . p. 79 RUBIN You are not ! I 'm making this fire . If you want to try lignite , try smoking it . It goes out as easy as a Richmond Straight . BILL putting down his coal and looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RUBIN I damn near froze meself to death giving it a chance , one winter . It do n't give off any more heat than a lightning bug . He lights the fire . Baldy and Hopper come in with wood . BALDY to Rubin.Do you know how to do that ? RUBIN Do I know how to do it ? My specialty is setting fires . BALDY Ah , let me at that . RUBIN What the hell do you know about it ? BALDY be elbows Rubin away.Me , I 'm the cow that kicked over the lantern in Chicago . That ai n't no way . When it comes to starting fires I 'm the San Francisco earthquake . See that ? He sets about mixing water and flour in a basin . BILL What 's that going to be ? BALDY How do I know till I get it made ? BILL Well , you might have some idea . p. 80 BALDY Look at the menu . Maybe it 's waffles . He beats the mixture vigorously with an iron spoon . BILL eyeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much good . BALDY Well , for God 's sake ! Who do you think I 'm making it for  --  you ? You 're going to be lucky if you get any of this . BILL Yeah ? BALDY What did you ever do to earn your breakfast anyway ? BILL I got a half ton of coal here to sell , if anybody wants it . I lugged it all the way from the river bottom , too . BALDY Well , you can take it right back again now . I do n't want this here kitchen floor looking like a coal bin . BILL God , but you 're getting domestic . Baldy pours batter on the griddle . RUBIN Gee , that looks queer to me . HOPPER Looks kinda stringy , Baldy , and kinda lumpy . Maybe you better beat it some more . BALDY Say , are you cooking this breakfast , or am I doing it ? HOPPER I do n't know whether it 's breakfast or not , and I do n't know whether it 's cooking , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be responsible . p. 81 OKLAHOMA Come to think of it , in the best circles they ai n't really eating breakfast since the war . Somehow , when I look at that there that Baldy 's playing with , I ai n't got any appetite . The Snake comes in , sits , and watches Baldy silently . RUBIN Honest to God , now , Baldy , what is it you 're making , if any ? BILL Ah , Baldy 's doing fine . If he had some ham now he could make some damn good ham and eggs , if he had some eggs . BALDY That 's a new one , that is . You plucked that one fresh right out of the Garden of Eden . RUBIN On the level , what d' you call it ? Not that I give a damn . BALDY If you really want to know , it 's drop cakes . BILL I do n't like the name . BALDY No , you would n't . BILL No , it reminds me of something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BALDY Well , the theory is , you beat ' em till you get air in ' em , see ; and then you do n't need anything to rise ' em . OKLAHOMA Oh yeah , well , maybe you did n't beat ' em enough . p. 82 BILL Maybe you beat ' em too much . You prob'ly knocked the wind out of ' em . RUBIN tastes batter and spits it out.Did you ever make any of them before , or is this a first attempt ? BALDY Maybe I did and maybe I did n't . I used to be cookie in a circus .

SNAKE Stand away from there ! OKLAHOMA You 're used to having your own way , ai n't you , Snake ? Up to the time you met me you was completely spoiled . And since you met me you never do get your own way . It 's hard on you , and you 've got my sympathy . But do n't talk so loud . Snake rushes Oklahoma and is knocked back into the room .

MOSE Looking out.Ah 'm just trying to get warm . OKLAHOMA Now , here 's the rest of the story . We 've got to cook up something to tell the bulls so we 'll all give it to ' em the same way . This is how I figure it out . If they do n't know Angel-face was with us we wo n't tell ' em . And nobody knows who kicked the dick off the train , see ? That was just an unhappy accident , that 's all . The poor guy lost his balance and fell . And no matter what they say nobody here knows anything about the row at Williston , get that ? That must of been another gang . And if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Red or Edna , either . Bill , look out the window and see if Red 's out of sight . BILL looking out.They just went behind the willows . OKLAHOMA Then they wo n't see them , that 's sure . There 's only one thing wrong with the dope . They know the kids was on that train and they wo n't quit hunting till they get ' em . Now if there was only somebody here that looked like a frail he could play Angel-face and that 'd certainly gain time . RUBIN Maybe I could do it . p. 89 BILL You need a shave too bad . RUBIN Baldy , he ought to be able to do it . OKLAHOMA Or if there was only another little redheaded guy He looks out the door . They 're coming , ' Boes ; lie around and look natural .

SHERIFF That sounds kind of phoney to me. to Baldy.Who are you ? BALDY Ex-soldier . Honorable discharge . See that ? Pointing to his scar . SHERIFF How 'd you get that ? BALDY Fighting for my country . SHERIFF to Bill.Did you see a guy called little Red on the train ? BILL Me ? Little Red ? OKLAHOMA Sure he did . BILL Sure I did .

SHERIFF Boys , is that what you call him ? BILL Yeah , he 's little Red . I would n't have told you , only he told you first . SHERIFF Fine . That makes you an accessory . OKLAHOMA The hell it does . I tell you  --  SHERIFF Tell that in the dock . Boys , we 've got an accessory . p. 94 OKLAHOMA Like hell . SHERIFF If you want to get out of here without having your face wrecked , shut up till we ask you to talk . OKLAHOMA That 's jake with me . SHERIFF to Snake.You .

Smells like it . SECOND DEPUTY Ah , it 's their damn pancakes . SHERIFF Ah , let ' em scorch ! They go out .
