txt After scoring five victories over the ' defense in a court session of the Hall . Mills case yesterday at Somerville , N4 J. , Assistant Attorney General Alexander Simpson struck another- blw4 I He obtained a warrant for the arrest of Felix De Martini , chief of the defense private detectives , charging him with being an accessory after the fact . De Martini surrendered to the police in Brooklyn last night and announced that he Would fight extradition to New Jersey . Early this morning after the private agent had been locked in a cell in Brooklyn Police Headquarters , his attorneys obtained a writ of habeas corpus from Supreme Court Justice Charles J. Druhan directing the police to produce De Martini in Part II , of the Brooklyn Supreme Court at 10:80 A. M. this morning and to show cause why he should not be released . Development followed development lit rapid succession when Senator Rini* son faced the battery of defense attorneys in the Court of Oyer and Terminer , composed of Supreme Court Justice Charles W. Parker and Common Pleas Judge Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions in the case , and he then defeated the opposing counsel when they presented two motions . The State 's representative succeeded in severing the trials of the four persons charged with the murder of the Rev. Dr. Edward W. Hall and Mrs , Eleanor R. Mille . They are Mrs Frances Stevens Hall , widow of the clergyman : her brothers , Willie Stevens and Henry Stevens : her cousin , Henry de la Bruyere Carpender . The Court decided that Henry Carpender must face the jury alone . First Trial Set for Nov. 3 . The Senator than suggested Nov. 3 as the date for the trial of Mrs. Hall and her brothers . Robert H. McCarter , former Attorney General , leader of the Hall-Stevens-Carpender legal forces , protested , demanding a speedier trial . The Assistant Attorney General put the question to the Court . It sustained him . The special prosecutor next demanded that a " struck jury " be called for service at the trials . A jury of this type is composed of prominent citizens , selected as likely to be unbiased and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought this move . The Senator won his third round when Justice Parker directed that a " struck " ' panel of 160 names be chosen . Senator Simpson , who was in an unusually aggressive mood , followed this up by asking that the September Grand Jury be charged by Justice Parker on the Hall-Mills case . This request created a stir among the defense lawyers . It came without warning and was followed by the Senator 's statement that he wished the Grand Jurors instructed on how to return an indictment or indictments charging unnamed persons or a person with being an accessory after the fact . Justice Parker said that he would charge the Grand Jury as requested . Mr. McCarter then entered his plea that the defense be permitted to inspect the minutes of the Somerset Grand *Jury which refused to indict Mrs. Hall in November , 1922 . He dis- , closed that the defense sought to prove by the minutes that two State 's witnesses had told different stories four years ago than they now tell . He named the witnesses as Raymond Schneider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ar falsely charging the crime to another youth , and Mrs. Jane Gibson , the " pig woman , " whose story led to the indictment against the four defendants . Defense 's Plea Rejected . The Court ruled against the defense . The former Attorney General then asked permission for the defense to examine the calling card which was found propped against the shoe ' of Dr. Hall when his body was discovered . The State contends that fingerprints on the calling card are those of Willie Stevens . Intimating that the fingerprints might have been forged , 30 . McCarter said he thought the defense was entitled to have experts look . at the marks : Once again the decision of the Court was that nothing in the law allowed the defense to test the State 's evidence in advance of trial . The Senator 's victories on these two motions were not achieved without " fireworks . " His temper was aroused several times , notably when Mr. McCarte. charged that copies of the Grand Jury minutes had been delivered by the prosecution to The Daily Mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . famous murder . mystery ; The State 's ' attorney resented this charge deeply . He passed the lie to Mr. McCarter twice and the Court rapped for order . The warrant for De Martini was obi tained from Judge Cleary after the court session ended . It was delivered . to Captain Harry Walsh and Sergeant Richard Burke for service . They went ? to De Martini 's office at 5 Beek .. man Street , Manhattan , and found it closed for the day . The private agent was out when the Jersey City detectives first called at his home , 103 Chestnut Street , Brooklyn . Attorneys with De Martini . ; Captain Walsh and Sergeant Burke , ' accompanied by Detective Francis Trainor of the Homicide Squad of the New York Police Department , went again last night to the home . De Martini had not yet returned , but . while the detectives were waiting across the street he passed into the house . With him were Timothy N. Pfeiffer and Nathaniel J. Palzer , defense attorneys . A short time later Mr. Palzer came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short conversation and then the attorney and the three policemen entered the house . There DeMar-tini was put under arrest by Detective Trainor , charged with being a fugitive from justice . Mr. Pfeiffer did all the talking for the prisoner before he was taken to Brooklyn Police Headquarters . The only thing De Martini would say in reference to the charges against him was , " I Would n't do a thing of that sort no matter what the circumstances were . " Mr. Pfeiffer gave out the following - statement : " The whole matter of this arrest is again characteristic of the methods used by Senator Simpson in conducting this investigation . In absence of evidence he is trying to establish a reign of terror . " Mr. De Martini is a man whom I have known since I was in the District Attorney 's office . His integrity is above suspicion . He is vouched for not only by me but by numerous District Attorneys in New York County for whom he has done work of the highest calibre since he resigned from the Police Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division , under Police Commissioner Arthur Wood . He has an unblemished record . " His work in the HalleMills case , both four years ' ago and- now , was done under my personal ' supervision . The charges in the affidavit are wholly false . He will be taken to Brooklyn Police Headquarters , where I will endeavor to get a judge to give ine a habeas corpus ' writ . He will be produced by the defense at the trial irrespective of the outcome of proceedings resulting from ' the affidavit made by Chief Underwood . " Inspector John J. Underwood announced that he would appear in the office of District Attorney Charles J. Dodd in Brooklyn tomorrow morning to start extradition proceedings , if De Martini refused to waive his rights . Hayes Had Predicted Arrest . It was said that De Martini was the " fifth defendant " mentioned on Friday by Patrick Hayes , Chief of Hudson County detectives and the Senator 's right hand man in the case . It could not be learned definitely , however , whether De Martini was the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief had said specifically that the man to be arrested ' would be charged with murder , whereas the warrant against De Martini charged only that he was an accessory after the fact . Barely a score of persons were on hand at 10 A. M. when the hearing at Somerville got under way . The Senator had just started to address the Court on his order for severance when Justice- Parker ' asked ' why the defendants were not in court . Mr. McCarter explained he had sent for Mrs. Hall , but he had not expected Vthat the defendants ' would - be - -   ; pet- .. educed . On agreement between Mr. ' Simpson and Mr. McCarter , the formality of having the accused in court was dispensed with . Mrs. Hall then visited the Jail . " My first application , " resumed Senator Simpson , " is - for a severance . The State asks that Henry Carpender be tried separately , as the evidence against him is different than the evidence against the others  --  some evidence that is competent against him is-not competent against the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a matter of right on the part of the prosecutor . Therefore I ask for a ruling from the Court . " Mr. McCarter rose in opposition . He said the defendants had " been jointly indicted and should be tried . jointly . " He added that the State 's case , as disclosed to him and his associates in the various hearings , was that Mrs. Hall , Willie Stevens and Henry Carpender had been described as at the scene of the murder . He contended that any evidence admissible against one was germane to all . He mentioned that no effort had been made . to try Henry Stevens alone . Mrs. Gibson 's story , or so much of it as has been made public , did no : place Henry Stevens on the scene of the crime , the prosecutor linking him through other witnesses . McCarter Opposes Delay . " Of course , " went on the chief defense attorney , a note of sarcasm in his voice , " I can quite appreciate the fact that the indictment of Henry Stevens is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Court is that only three persons were at the scene . In all candidness aue frankness , we ca n't imagine how any evidence that applies to one does n't apply to all . Here are three men in jail . They have been deprived of their liberty ; they have been indicted on evidence . " I think your Honors should think of the delay  --  those severed would be compelled to linger on in jail . I say that they are entitled to a speedy trial and jointly . I think they are entitled to a speedy trial . When you consider the expense that another trial would involve , not only for the county but for these defendants , every course urges that they be tried together . " The newspapers that have been trying this case have called these geople wealthy . I have been called a ' billion-dollar ' attorney . Leaving the personal allusion out of it entirely , I say that these people are not wealthy ; they are people , of moderate means . I think that they should not be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most earnestly pray  --  nay , beg ? that- this order of severance be not granted . " Senator Simpson retorted as follows : " I haae evidence which Mr. McCarter knows nothing about . I have evidence . which is not before the Court , and I sa , y.that it would be a grave injustice to the State to deny/ this application . ' The State says , through the Attorney General , that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a joint trial . The Court should not take the responsibility of ordering a joint trial . " Court Grants His Request . Justice Parker conferred with Judge Cleary . " It may be that the State has important evidence , " he said , " not yet disclosed . I accede to the request that an order of severance be issued . " " I now notify the defense , " said Senator Simpson , plainly pleased , " that I shall move the trial of Mrs. Hall , William Stevens and Henry Stevens first . " The Special Prosecutor made his request for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the defendants was allowed twenty peremptory challenges of jurors and that the ordinary panel - of forty-eight talesman would be exhausted by right of challenge alone . He then cited the law which empowers the Sheriff , in the event that a normal panel is exhausted , to go out on the streets near the court and assemble another panel for the emergency . The Senator hinted that he ' feared the defense might have persons standing around ready to serve in an emergency . This suggestion struck fire from the defense attorneys , but they passed the statement without comment . " We need an impartial jury in this case , " said Senator Simpson , " so that if there are acquittals or convictions no finger can be pointed at the jury . " Mr. McCarter asked that the normal practice , namely , selection of a regular petit trial jury , be followed . He insisted that the State give a " good cause " for a struck jury . " We are in no way responsible , " he said , " for the four-year interregnum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After Justice Parker had granted a , " struck " jury , Mr. McCarter said : " We have given notice of a motion in this case tor a speedy trial ter the defendants , the three in jail and the- , one , Mrs. under bail . We ask this as their constitutional right . We are ready to go le-trial on a moment 's notice . " Tells ' of California Witness . " The State is ready to move the trial on Nov. 3 , " replied Senator Simpson . " We have a very important witness who is now in California and who will not be available until Nov. 3 . The new witness came to our attention only in the last few days . I 'd like it noted that in moving the trial on Nov. 3 we are moving it forty days before the date when the defendants have a right to have it moved . " Mr. McCarter said : " I am shocked that the Prosecutor should set a date a full month away . I do n't see how the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these defendants are languishing in jail . " " What would you do , Mr. McCarter , " . said Judge Parker , " if you had a material witness for the defense who would not be available before then ? " " Ah , " said Mr. McCarter , pausing a moment , " I suppose I should have to disclose the materiality of the witness . " After a further argument by the defense , the Court allowed Nov. 3 as the date of the first trial . The proceedings the centred on the defence 's application for the Grand Jury minutes of 1922 . " The State put them into the hands of the Daily Mirror , " said Mr. McCarter reading from his supporting affidavit . " That is untrue , " shouted Senator Simpson , thrusting a finger at his adversary , " that is a lie , and he is n't going to get away with that while I am in the court . " " Lie " Charge Brings Rebuke . Justice Parker rapped with his gavel . He frowned at the Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to ask about that  --  how do you know , Mr. McCarter , that the State gave them to this newspaper ? " " The State had the stenographic notes , " he began . Senator Simpson again broke in . " That is a lie , " he said , his face flushing . " The Court will not permit the lie to be passed , " said Justice Parker , rapping vigorously . " Anything else you wish to say on your motion , Mr. McCarter ? " The motion was denied and then Senator Simpson , with a smile , said he regretted that he had " used the short and ugly word , " but added that his regret was that he had used It in the presence of the Court . " I do not take it back , however , " he said : The prosecutor then said that he " specifically exempted "  --  the Senator from , Somerset County , from his attack on the defense . He referred to his legislative colleague , State - Senator Clarence B. Case of Somerville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " continued the Senator , " has made a ' bouleversement , ' as the French say , a topsy-turvy , of the law , but if he wants to go on in this personal vein I 'll go right along with him . " The battle shifted to the calling card . Mr. McCarter made his plea for permission to inspect it , so that when the State put it into evidence in the case attorneys for the defendants would be ready to cross-examine . Senator Simpson twitted his adversaries on their failure to permit him to introduce it as evidence at the preliminary hearings accorded to Mr. Carpender. and Willie Stevens three weeks ago at Somerville . Says Defense Passed Up Chance . He said he had tried to have it marked in evidence ; but that the defense had successfully kept it out . He added that had the card gone into the record the defense would have been at liberty to " photograph it and examine it as much as they like . " Now , he added , their situation was different . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " forbids the State to take any chances . Some of the people indicted have employed private detectives and they had a lawyer , an expert in homicide cases from the New York District Attorney 's office , in their house right after the murder . " When the Court decided in his favor on this point Mr. Simpson moved for the Grand Jury to be charged . " I wish you would explain to the Grand Jury particularly how to proceed in considering an indictment charging a person with being an accessory after the fact of a murder , " said Senator Simpson . " We have evidence which we want to present to this Grand Jury whichhas come to our attention within the last few days , and we want to be sure the Grand Jury is properly instructed as to just how to indict . " Later the Senator explained that he wanted to have explained to the Grand Jurors the law which dealt with a pear son becoming an accessory through the destruction of evidence . The application for a bench warrant was made to Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Martini immediately after the last motion had been disposed of . The defense attorneys went ' into an impromptu conference in the court morn unaware that the wargant had been issued . They said they had nothing to say on the ' developments in the case . Witness Offered to Talk . The new witness referred to by Senator Simpson as in California is a man about 35 years old who formerly lived in New Brunswick : He wrote to the Senator some time ago and investigators have checked the statements he made in the letter . He offered in his letter to come forward voluntarily and tell what he knew . He is reported to have said he was in De Russey 's Lane the night of the crime . but what he saw or heard , if anything , was not disclosed . The man is said to be known to Henry L. Dickman , former State Trooper . Dickman in an affidavit to investigators on Wednesday charged - that he had received money to .. drop his lone hand investigation . of - the case ' four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This . man , . referred to only ' as " Mr. Y : , " . is said to ' have informed the investigators that he was accompanied by a woman on the night in question . He is pictured as ready to tell his story if the consent of the woman is obtained . " This man is as important as Lackman himself , " said . Inspector Underwood - last night . " We did not get any information on this man from Dickman , however . " Inspector Underwood , after a series of denials , admitted ' that the warrant for De Martini had been handed to Captain Walsh and Sergeant Burke . The two detectives were posted outside De Martini 's house last night , awaiting his return . Two Manhattan detectives were with them . The detectives said that when they first visited De Martini 's office he had gone out the ' back door . - According to the detectives , De Martini consulted attorneys several days ago . Several demands for the surrender of De Martini have been made to the defense attorneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
