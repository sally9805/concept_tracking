txt NEW HAVEN FIRE . Audience Credited With Great Coolness in the Midst of Danger . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your editorial article entitled " Somebody Much to Blame , " dealing with the Rialto Theatre fire in New Haven , grossly misstates the facts which led to the deaths and injuries of the audience . The statement that " the panic rather than the fire caused the deaths and injuries " is disproved by the fact that seventy-five of the eighty on the inlured list suffered from burns and the six who , died , died from a direct result of severe burns . Within ten seconds of the time that the first great sheet of flame licked up the cheesecloth draperies and rolled up across the balcony and ceiling of the theatre , two great tongues of flame shot out toward the balcony exits , sucked by the draft created upon opening the fire escape doors . The audience there suffered most . The audience on the main floor walked up the aisle , coats over their heads to protect them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fifty Yale students who worked heroically both at the exits anti inside the theatre , the casualties would have been increased fivefold . Thirty-three students were still in the hospitals last Tuesday . One of them died . The entire theatre was consumed by the flames in thirty minutes from the time the fire started . The second and third alarms came within six minutes of the first alarm . The building burned like tinder . ? It is to be admitted that in most cases the ensuing panic from a theatre fire injures more people in the stampede than does the fire , but in the case of the Rialto , Theatre the flames were responsible for practically all casualties . You also were right in your judgment that a Connecticut audience living within the influence of Yale should be the last crowd to fly into a panic . They were . It was the most apathetic crowd that ever went through a fire . J. H. J. ADAMS . New Haven , Dec. 1 , 1921 . Blame for New Haven Fire . To the Editor of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sophomore at Yale , lies in the Yale Infirmary , probably at death 's door , a victim of the fearful mev ing picture fire in New Haven . This fire in a period of less than five minutes , as the re . port comes , was a seething mass of flames where no human being could live . Others lost their lives and scores were injured . The Rialto Theatre was a structure nearly a hundred years old . The rapidity of its destruction proves it to have been literally a tinder box , totally unfit as a place for assembly of an audience of over five hundred people , packed to the last seat . With the first news from New Haven comes the report that Mayor Fitzgerald " would order an inquiry into conditions in all local theatres as to provisions made for safeguarding and preventing fires , " and that " the manager of the theatre was held by Coroner Mix on a charge of manslaughter . " A self - convicting criminal afterthought . Questions : ' Why was this miserable fire trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What pull did the owner have for a permit with the powers that be in New Haven ? Why should the manager be hold for manslaughter ? Why should not the Mayor and the license-granting authorities of New Haven be held for manslaughter ? New York , Nov. 28 , 1921 , JUSTICE .

I am from Arizona , and , although Bisbee , Ariz. , Is thousands of miles from here and only nine miles from the Mexican border , I used to enjoy reading your paper down there in the Copper Queen Library .

LEAGUE OR ASSOCIATION ? Views on the Possible Development of the Washington Conference . In many journals , including most of those which favored America 's joining the League of Nations and which later found little difficulty in following the advice of the " eminent thirty-one " and supporting Mr. Harding , one may now read fervent appeals for universal , nonpartisan support of the limitation of I armaments conference . On the other hand , there is a conviction in many minds that this conference . was conceived not so much in the love and fellowship of man as in the hatred for one great man and his works , and that the ultimate result of the conference will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies to study various matters now of interest in connection with world peace , rather than definite results in the limitation of armaments or any other matters , Such agencies will , of course , parallel , similar activities by the League and . having American support without which great results can not be accomplished , may well be expected to eclipse the League efforts . The fact that they do eclipse the efforts of the League  --  ham- strung by America 's opposition under the direction of a leading member of the " thirty-one " ? will , of course , , be ; cited as proof that the League was ; abortive from the start and that op- ? position to it was far-sighted states- ? manship . Are those who believe that this con-. ference is accomplishing nothing and will accomplish nothing that might not . better have been ' accomplished long since by the League of Nations , with Ameri- ? can participation , under any obligations , to view the past as irretrievable and immaterial , abandon the League of Nations and follow the lead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " thirty-one " who but recently were to lead America  --  through Mr. Harding  --  into the League ? I believe not , for if these gentlemen have , hanged their minds as to the desirability of America 's joining the League it must be concluded that their motive was that . of political expediency , for they have announced no other . A world association loosely formed and founded upon hatred and political expediency could hardly hold its members to any if ' national expediency dictated wise . Believers in the League should keen clearly in mind the historically proved fact that conferences and loosely formed associations , alliances and " ententes " can never hold their members in times of stress unless selfish interests so dictate ' ; that peace must be " enforced , " if you choose , as Mr. Taft and ' Mr. Roosevelt once believed it should be , ?

Other nations can hardly be expected to invite America 's disfavor ? by clinging to the League in the face of America 's insistence upon other agencies . As to conference results , the outstanding feature thus far is the proposed limitation of naval strength in battleships , now known to be as obsolete as tomahawks as a weapon in the next great war . Can any one believe that the powers in this and other matters are agreeing in Washington to anything they would refuse if America proposed it in Geneva ? Are Mr. Balfour , Mr. Viviani , Mr. Koo and others ? ny less statesmen there than here ? Furthermore , can any one belie-ee that with America 's help in Geneva the powers would not also agree to limit airplanes , high explosives , deadly gases and other war weapons  --  modern , not obsolete  --  and that they will never consent to limit their use of such modern weapons as they consider most vital for their own purposes , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the League Covenant ?

To the Editor of The New York Times : I have been a reader of THE TIMES for twenty years , and desire to express my appreciation of Senator Borah 's position on the association of nations now in session . Three cheers for Senator Borah ! I think he is the biggest man in the Republican Party , and while I am an independent voter , if the G. 0 .

To the Editor of The New York Times : In your article , " Aids to German Forgetting , " in your issue of today you draw the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been prefaced , it would seem , by Marshal Hindenburg with an admonition to the youth of Germany not to forget that " what has been German ought to become German again . " To the spirit of that publication you take exception , justly so I think . It is an unwholesome spirit , to which I , as a German , also take exception . Moreover , I feel sure that the vast bulk of the people of the new Germany of which you speak with some evident mistrust , however much they may regret the territorial loss which their country has suffered , are totally and emphatically opposed to the creation of a spirit of revenge , such as apparently emanates from the lines of Marshal Hindenburg . It can not be denied that such a spirit is ' prevalent to a great extent among the old military leaders of the former German Empire , now out of power and disrobed of their old glory , but I am convinced that I am not exaggerating if I maintain that such sentiments are almost entirely'confined to that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , while not forgetful of the eminent services which men like Hindenburg have rendered their country , resent the agitation which those military leaders are helping by lending their names to publications like the one to which you refer , as much as they resent all efforts which would lead to a resurrection of the old regime and its ill-conceived policies .

" It is eminently fair to place before your readers some real facts regarding a Governor whose record , in my memory , stands out preeminent in these trying times .

Washington , Nov. 29 , 1021 . TUMULTY 'S ARTICLES . Varying Views of Their Value In Political History . The dominant thing which is disclosed in Mr. Tumuity 's articles is the mighty character of the man Wilson . Here is shown the supreme statesman invariably equal to every occasion . In reading these splendid articles , in which the author shows the mental poise and calm deliberation of his exchief in the most distressing situations , can any one doubt that Woodrow Wilson was a God-sent man ? While the details of this great and glorious life are being revealed , while the sacrifices he endured are being made known and we get some faint conception of the tremendous responsibilities he had to assume and how conscientiously these responsibilities were discharged irrespectve of class , creed or popular thought , it would seem to me that there should be ensnrined In the hearts of all our people an everlasting gratitude for the beneficent guidance rendered by the supervision and masterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great war . W. E. SWEENEY . Dover , N. J. , Nov. 27 , 1921 . Roosevelt 's Attack Recalled . To the Editor of The New York Times : As most of the criticism II Wilson has been on account of his pusillanimous inaction following the sinking of the Lusttania , both in failing to enforce strict accountability on Germany 's part and In refusing to prepare for the inevitable entry of this country into the war , it is quite natural that Tumulty should deal largely with this period . After you have finished the publication of the Tumulty apologia and have fully informed a long-suffering arid innocently bystanding public of what this most insignificant of Americans thinks of Wilson , I would suggest that for the sake of the record and " lest we forget , " you publish what an infinitely greater American , named Theodore Roosevelt , thought of Wilson 's conduct during this same period . Hie views are well set forth in a speech , which I think it would be most fitting to publish in full as a final instalment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that Roosevelt said in that speech : " He ' Wilson has made our statesmanship a thing of empty elocution ? ? ? In the face of the world he has covered the nation 's face with shame as ' with a garment . " " He has covered his fear standing for the right behind a veil of rhetorical phrases . " " I believe that he has dragged in the dust what was most sacred in our past . " " He has been claiming credit because in the case of Belgium . he has preserved a neutrality which would liaVe. mede Pontius Pilate quiver with envy . " " He has stood by without a single throb of his cold heart , without the least quickening of his tepit pulse , while the Turk inflicted on the Armenian and the Syrian Christians wrongs which would have blasted the memorT of Attila , and he has claimed credit for his neutral indifference to their sufferings . " " In the great world crisis fhe has played a more evil part than Buchanan and Pierce ever played in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War . " " The times have needed a Washington or a Lincoln . Unfortunately we have been granted only another Buchanan . " 1 should like to hear the comment Roosevelt would have made could he have read the Tumulty version of Wilson 's statement as to why he did net urge our entry into the war following the sinking of the Lusitania . ' rhnt statement is most illuminating , It shows that Wilson conceived his function to be that a a weather-vane rather than a leader . It should be entitled " Hamlet 's Third Soliloquy . " As some of your readers have said , Mr. Tumulty is undoubtedly doing a great service to the country . He is showing afresh the profound Wisdom back of the recent 7,000,000 plurality against Wilsonism . He is demonstrating the eternal Justice summed up in the result of the " solemn referendum " that Mr. Wilson and got . wanted ? a GEORGE S. BRENGLE . Arlington , N. J. , Nov , 28 , 1921 . His Faith Confirmed . To the Editor of The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our foremost evening newspapers printed a splendid editorial on the achievements of Woodrow Wilson  --  but quite overlooked the underlying factors that made him great and able to accomplish what he did . I felt strongly that in any estimate of Mr. Wilson only half was said when these factors were omitted , and so wrote to the newspaper , calling attention to its failure to emphasize the two outstanding traits of Mr. Wilson 's characteahis absolute honesty of purpose and his passion for service . No man could feel the latter without having the human quality strongly developed , and no man could be truly great witheut possessing this intense love of mankind . Therefore , although I do not know Mr. Wilson , and have judged him only by his deeds , it is gratifying to have one 's faith confirmed by the revelations in Mr. Tumulty 's articles. , As for Mr. Wilson 's enemies , when hate , intolerance , prejudice and envy enter  --  there is no room for reason .

To the Editor of The New York Times : I ' want to thank TILE Timis for giving us the opportunity of studying recent history by publishing the series of revelations made by Tumulty . They explain , and very satisfactorily , many things heretofore not quite clear to the average man . That some errors have crept into Tumulty 's work can not be denied , as , for example , his statements about the convention of 1912 , when Bryan deliberately committed political suicide in order to cleave the progressive element from Clark and allow the strongest , Woodrow Wilson , to attract the largest portion of the scattering votes resulting from the disintegration of Clark 's support . I consider the nomination and election of Wilson the greatest achievement that Bryan ever wrought . How mean and how petty and how untrue are the words of Roosevelt of Nov. 27 , referred to by Tumulty in today 's number , on the repudiation of Wilson in the previous Congressional election How mean and stupid of the Senators then to think that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant to see that leaders of the Democratic Party are helping and encouraging Harding in his constructive work .
