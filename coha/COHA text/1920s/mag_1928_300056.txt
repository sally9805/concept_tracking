Philadelphians had the right to be downright vexed last week . For a month the transcontinental bus system projected last summer ( TIME , June 4 ) and now named Yelloway-Pioneer System had been operating between Los Angeles and Philadelphia . But the country was told very little of the accomplishment . Last week the bus system was extended to Manhattan , 3,433 highway miles from Los Angeles , and there was much to do . A Mrs. C. A. Jondro of Los Angeles , one of the four persons who made the whole journey ( in 5 days , 14 hours ) , declared the ride more comfortable than by train and " more chummy . . . . We had a portable radio and perfect service all the way . "
