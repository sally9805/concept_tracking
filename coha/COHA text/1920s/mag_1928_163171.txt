They declared there was plenty of anti-pneumonia serum to be had in Quebec . Said Spokesman David : <P> " But I can not stomach this way of making profit of a tragic situation under the mask of charity . Here we have everything that is necessary , and we do not need people to come from the United States to bring us serum . We can get along without American doctors be they the most accomplished specialists of that great country . <P> " The serum-why they did not even try it . It was not the good one . We pass for a country of snows . That is bad enough without calling us a land of ignorants . We have scientists . We have serums . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
