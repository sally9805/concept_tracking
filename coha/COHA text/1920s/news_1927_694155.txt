txt New gas rate schedule of Consolidated Gas is one of the most important forward steps the company has made . For the first time the company has started a drive for new business through reduction in rates . The move is frankly a competiti%e one , designed to have gas actively compete with coal and oil , and so extend its use in industries and home heating . In many ways the new schedule follows the successful use of " power load " rates used by electric companies in building business . Gas business is a two season affair . low demand in summer and high in ' winter . Station capacity must be provided for peak winter demands . This leaves idle investment during the summer . T.NTIN1 OP lft 12V z.0 ... s To build up summer loud the lowest rate is offered industrial consumers taking on gas in summer and using other fuels in the winter . Brickyards , water heating and similar lines are in this category . For winter use by industrial consumers and for home heating the rite is higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous rates . Householders ' rate is unchanged , except if gas is used for heating homes . If all consumers who can do so avail themselves of new schedule , company estimates annual profits would be reduced by $1,100,000 . This would be 25 cents a share on the common or about 3 of total net . But all customers ' will not immediately adapt themselves to the new schedule . So the estimate of $1,100.000 reduction is not likely to become a reality . Meanwhile , expansion of business will close up the gap of profit reduction . In time , new business will bring larger net . The winter months show demand 1.58 times that of May to October , inclusive , which forms the " valley " of consumption . Biggest month , usually January , demand is 21= times as large as the smallest month , usually August . The lowest rate in new schedule applies from May to October , inclusive , fixing $1.20 for first 200 feet and GO cents for each 1,000 cubic feet additional .

A separate schedule is provided for November to April , inclusive , for large consumers based on demand on station capacity It provides a charge for each 100 feet of daily maximum demand , ranging from $2 50 to t1,1.60 month depending on maximum , with 60 cents for earn 1,000 cubic feet consumed . As industrial demand runs rather uniform , company has the advantage of knowing market requirements in advance . The consumer is benefited by lower rates . A consumer of 2,000 cubic feet a day will pay equivalent : of $1.02 a thousand against present flat rate of $1.15 . Consumer of 50.000 cubic feet a day will pay equhalent of 81f cents against $1.02 at present . Company 's old schedule started at $1.15 per 1,000 cubic feet for first 100,000 cubic feet a month ; $1.10 for next 200 000 ; $1.05 for next 300,000 ; $1.00 for next 400000 and 9:i cents on any excess of 1.000.000 feet a month .

Now done largely by coal and oil , in this line gas will sharply compete with these other fuels . Gas will have the advantage of continuity of supply from a main source as well as eloninution of ashes and furnace men .
