Late in the week , Professor Edwin W. Kemmerer , famed Princeton economist , onetime fiscal consultant to the German Reichsbank and to the governments of South Africa , Chile , etc. , returned to the U. S. after a two weeks ' visit in Poland , whither he had gone at the invitation of the Polish Government and by the request of Dillon , Read &; Co. of Manhattan , who have recently dealt largely in Polish government securities . <P> At Princeton , Professor Kemmerer gave out a long statement in which he described the Polish Government as " taking hold with a firm hand , " and the Poles as " grimly determined to pull through " the present period of financial depression . He added that the Polish Government has cut its budget 25% for the coming year and instituted other drastic economies , and he believes they will make good . <P> Observers noted that considerable hue and cry has been raised during the past two weeks over reports and rumors concerning what Professor Kemmerer did or did not think about Poland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return and paint the Polish fiscal situation in glowing colors . German correspondents , jealous of the tide of U. S. investments which they imagined this would turn in the direction of Poland , flayed Professor Kemmerer for " dashing over to report on Poland 's finances , while his classes are taking their Christmas recess . " Historians recalled that the Poles have been " pulling through " under adversity for generations . The anciently independent state known as " Poland " was twice partitioned among Prussia , Russia and Austria - at the end of the 18th Century and at the beginning of the 19th . In 1914 only " Austrian Poland " was autonomous . During the war Austro-German forces occupied " Russian Poland , " and in 1916 Wilhelm II and Franz Josef proclaimed the independence of " Poland " without defining the area which they referred to by that term . Repeated attempts were then made by " Poles " to organize a government among themselves . Not until after the War , however , did they succeed , under the benevolent eye of the Allies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an autonomous state by the Treaty of Versailles ; and not until then did " Marshal " Josef Pilsudski attain recognition by the Powers as the first President of Poland . M. Stanislaw Wojciechowski was elected to succeed him in 1922 , and continues as Prezydent of the Rzeczpospolita Polska . The Sejm Ustawodawcry ( Parliament ) has actually existed since 1918 , when it was created by the earlier " Regency Council " and " Provisional Council of State " which sprang up in response to the necessity for some sort of government during the War . The Slavonic Poles naturally continue " Catholic " ( Russian Orthodox , Greek , Roman , Armenian , etc . ) . The present Republic has been described as " advanced , militaristic and enlightened .
