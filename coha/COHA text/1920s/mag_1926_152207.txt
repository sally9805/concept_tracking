On the political grave of the Ohio gang , the little flowers of indictment still grow every spring , scenting the air with the perfume of scandal and the breath of alleged corruption . Only last week another blossom opened . In Manhattan a grand jury indicted one time Attorney General Harry Daugherty , his good friend , the late Jesse Smith , John T. King , onetime Republican National Committeeman from Connecticut , and Thomas W. Miller , former Alien Property Custodian , for conspiracy to defraud the Government . The charge was that certain stock of the American Metal Co. was seized by the Alien Property Custodian as German property during the War , that the stock was sold for some $7,000,000 , and that in 1921 a Swiss corporation , really a blind for the German owners , recovered the money from the U. S. Government with the connivance of the indicted men . It is further charged that the German owners gave $391,000 in Liberty bonds , which were to be divided among the accused men , and a check for $50,000 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans were named in an indictment brought last year in regard to the same case . The new indictment omits the Germans but brings in Mr. Daugherty , who it is alleged certified payment of the claim of the Germans , so that once more the finger of accusation points at the Ohioan . It was alleged some time ago that $40,000 of the supposed $391,000 bribe in Liberty bonds were traced to Mr. Daugherty 's bank account in his brother 's bank at Washington Court House , Ohio . <P> Last week Mr. Daugherty exclaimed : <P> " The case upon which this charge is based was decided nearly five years ago by a division in the Department of Justice regularly authorized to pass on claims of this character . As in many other matters of a like nature , I was not even called upon to review their decision ; in fact , I never heard about the case until long after it had been disposed of . <P> " In a professional life covering 45 years I have never discussed or tried cases in the public press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know the fair-minded public will withhold its opinion until the case is decided . " <P> Senator Wheeler , who led the attack on Mr. Daugherty when the latter was Attorney General , merely said : <P> " If he is guilty , I hope he is punished ; if he is innocent , I hope he is acquitted . I do n't want to kick a man when he 's down . " <P> <P> Nearly two months ago , Charles R. Forbes , onetime Director of the Veterans ' Bureau , entered Leavenworth Prison for conspiracy to defraud the Government in the Veterans ' hospital scandal ( TIME , March 29 ) , which like the oil scandal spread its shadow over the Harding Administration . His fellow conspirator , John W. Thompson , likewise convicted , did not enter the prison because his lawyers represented that his health was poor . The Court ordered the lawyers to make a final argument in Chicago this week . Last week , however , Mr. Thompson , 64 and worried , died of a heart attack .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
