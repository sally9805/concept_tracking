txt While popular demonstrations at Moscow hail the victories of the Cantonese armies and the forward march of the " world revolution , " the responsible Soviet leaders are thinking of factory prices . So writes our Moscow correspondent In his Illuminating dispatch of yesterday . Of greater consequence than China for the future of the Bolshevist experiment in Russia is the success or failure of the Soviet Government in bringing industry down to something like a normal cost basis . The problem is not new . For four years the question of " the scissors " - the spread between what the peasant gets for his grain and what he must pay for his manufactured goods  --  has been acute . In times of crisis the Government steps in and lowers industrial prices by decree . The relief is momentary . Sometimes there is no relief . Despite the latest active campaign , the cost of manufactured goods in the first quarter of 1927 stands at 111/2 per cent .. over last year , when the situation was already intolerable . The Supreme Council of National Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production costs , but the costs go up ; a reduction of 10 per cent , in iron ore prices , and prices go up 10 per cent. : a reduction in printing costs and metallurgy , with similar results . The price factor is nearly always overlooked in reports from time to time about the " restoration " of Soviet industry . Factory and mine production may now be at SO per cent . of pre-war production measured in bulk . Sometimes it Is asserted that production is nearly up to the pre-war level . But Russian Industry can hardly be said to have been " restored " to the Pre-war level if increased production is attained by charging the consumer three or four times the pre-war price . Aside from prices , very rarely is mention made of the quality of production . TrtoTsicr , in his criticism of Soviet industrial methods , ! lead his respects to the shoddy nature of many goods unloaded on the public at greatly in creased prices . He argued that if a Soviet lead pencil is sold at three times the world-market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if it writes only one-third as well , the real price paid by the consumer attains fantastic proportions . TROTSKY did not think that increased efficiency in the factories is the complete answer . He was courageous enough to assert that in order to keep the nationalized factories going the peasants should be made to pay the necessary price . The Bolshevist experiment must be frankly conducted at the expense of the peasant consumer . To this STALIN would not consent . Last year 's battle between the two factions centred about the apparently abstract question whether socialism is attainable in Russia by itself . TROTSKY said No and argued , virtually , that until the world revolution came to their help the Russian Communists must compel the peasant to subsidize the Government factories . STALIN insisted that socialism is practicable in Russia going it alone . He would not increase the tax burdens of the peasantry . He would lower prices by increasing factory efficiency , suppressing graft , calling upon the factory workers for longer hours . Up to the present , to judge from the price level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
