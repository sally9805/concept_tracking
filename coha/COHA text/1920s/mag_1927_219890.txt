For two months past while Congressmen talked in Washington , staged filibusters and many a fistibout , legislators were active in less-known legislative halls throughout the 48 states . And none more so than Kansas , for they passed a bill repealing the anti-cigaret law ( TIME , Jan. 31 ) , a law prohibiting marriage for the physically unfit and a bill repealing the blue law against Sunday movies . Last week the session came to an unexpected climax as legislators stirred drowsily in their seats in the Kansas senate chamber , waiting the noon recess . One Edgar Bennett , State Senator , rose , called up a resolution petitioning Congress to cut off Federal road aid . Yards away , one Ben Hegler protested , picked up the nearest object at hand , let fly with the eye and arm of a veteran baseballer . His colleague , Senator Bennett , ducked , startled ; in the very centre of his bald head splashed vehemently a wet sponge .                 @ @ @ @
