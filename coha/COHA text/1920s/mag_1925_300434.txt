France 's most successful colonial administrator put a period to his career . For the last 13 years Marshal Lyautey has been building up Morocco . He pacified the major portion of it , consolidated the French protectorate , made it pay its way , put tens of thousands of Moroccan soldiers on the Allied front during the War . Only in 1916-17 , when he served as French Minister of War , did he cease temporarily to be an immediate personal power in Moroccan affairs . Last week , at 71 , he retired as French Resident General in Morocco , left his command and its recent complications in the hands of Marshal Petain . <P> Behind the long expected retirement of Marshal Lyautey lies a wealth of conjecture . <P> The old Marshal himself is said to take satisfaction in the official version of the matter , which is that he has waited to resign his post until recent French successes have made the fruits of his early labors again secure . His enemies frankly hint that Abd-el-Krim had nearly blasted the rich protectorate of Lyautey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have full credit for saving it . <P> The friends of the retiring commander hold that the personality of Lyautey has set its stamp indelibly upon Moroccan minds and hearts . To them any future rapprochement between Frenchmen and Moroccans must redound directly to their idol 's credit . <P> From Fez-it is reported that the officers of the retiring Marshal felt tears start to their eyes as he announced his decision . With him , they declare , a " great modern Ro-manf proconsul " passes . <P> <P> *Just 12 years ago every white inhabitant of Fez was massacred ; Lyautey punished the guilty , restored order . <P> tLike " Tiger " Clemenceau and Caillaux , Marshal Lyautey is the living embodiment of the relentlessly active proconsuls of Roman times . He is never still . Rising at 6:30 , it is his custom to work restlessly through a long day , conferring with his subordinates even at dinner , making plans late in the evening . His friends wonder if he will " break " with the sudden lifting of the pressure of affairs .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
