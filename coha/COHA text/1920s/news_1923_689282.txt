txt The strike of the employes of the Public Service Railway Company of New Jersey is ended as between the employers and workers . The latter accepted yesterday an increased wage of 20 per cent. , with a promise of more favorable conditions of work . It has been a rather curious strike , the public inconvenience having been relieved to a large extent by buses , some imported from other States , more having operated competitively with the trolleys before the strike . The strikers have made no attempt to interfere . When the cars will actually begin to run again depends upon the acceptance of the company 's proposal to buy out the competing bus lines on the understanding that there shall be no futfire licenses for such competitors . Through an " allied corporation , the " Public Service Railway Company , is " to run buses and cars in a co-ordi " nate service , charging a seven-cent " fare on both , with one-cent transfers " from one to the other . " Thus it offers a reduction of trolley fare , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates whenever circumstances will permit . The company asks that bus lines that wo n't accept their plan lose their licenses or be excluded from streets on which trolleys run . In reply the bus owners have asked the Newark City Commission for a fifteen-year franchise at a five-cent fare , . Many bus owners refuse to sell . A vital condition , insisted on by the company , is the acceptance by the State and municipalities of the valuation of its property at $110,000,000 made by Special Master HAIGICT . There are so many parties and discussions , and so many consents are to be had or refused to the company 's plan , that it is idle now to dwell on the details . One general fact emerges from the Jersey situation . The company is doing business at a loss . It ca n't be forced to continue to do so , as Chief Justice Guatiwsree said In effect when the Public Utilities Commission applied for a writ .

There is warm talk about " monopoly , " - but the public convenience should be the first consideration . The people ca n't be carried on fine phrases . The trolley cars accommodate more passengers than the buses . The rights of the majority ought to prevail . It will relieve congestion to keep the buses off streets where there are car tracks , at least in cities . As feeders are on special routes of their own they would serve a useful purpose . We all like to bloviate against " corporations , " and there is no tenderness in New Jersey for the Public Service Railway Company , but consolidation in place of competition seems reasonable . That , however , is for the Jersey authorities to decide . It is to be hoped that they will decide without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
