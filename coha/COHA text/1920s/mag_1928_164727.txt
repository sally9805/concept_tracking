THE WOMAN WHO RODE AWAY-D . H. Lawrence-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> By its sheer artistry , Sons and Lovers escapes its Freudian obsession with the mother-son relationship , and establishes itself as a classic human document expressed in lyric prose . But since then ( 1913 ) Author Lawrence has played less the artist and more the psychiatrist , his favorite study still the positive and negative reactions of sex attraction and repulsion . At their best the short stories of the present collection are a neurological graph done into Lawrence 's powerful prose , and at their predominant worst ( witness the title story ) they are queer extravaganzas of symbology . <P> Of the graphs , one or two plot the reactions of a slight half hour . Such is " Smile . " An English husband comes to the Italian nunnery where his wife lies dying . Mismated to her , he dreads their last words together . The Mother Superior , a comfortable woman in voluminous black , greets him with the news of his wife 's death . He goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with mischievous eyes , and a lovely hand " passive as a sleeping bird . " In the quivering candle glow the composure of the dead face mocks him , and his embarrassed relief reacts with an extraordinary smile . Contagious , it starts wickedly on the pained faces of the attendant nuns , like " subtle flowers opening . " The mischievous young one strangles her smile with sobs on the Mother Superior 's bosom , but the husband rushes , with his , down the echoing corridor , and out of the convent . <P> Another graph " The Man Who Loved Islands " registers the lifetime development of a man 's passion for aloofness . He first indulges his passion by buying an island where he is " The Master " over his own microcosm of necessary attendants-a butler , a housekeeper , a carpenter , a mason . Wearying of these servants , who cheat him , quarrel among themselves , and pine for the peopled mainland , he retreats to a smaller island where he is served by one old couple and their daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the daughter , whom he marries because he has got her with child . Irritated by these human complications , he escapes to the last island , a mere pile of rocks in the North . He finds solitude at last ; hunger and blockades of snow . In a frenzy of lonely remorse he staggers to the icebound shore , but sees not a sail .
