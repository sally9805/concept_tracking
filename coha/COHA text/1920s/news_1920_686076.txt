txt Contrary to reports from Pittsburgh , that United States Steel is contemplating wage cuts , effective January 1 , opinion in best informed circles here is that the corporation will not institute any wage changes at premnt. present . tieneral scaling down of wages by independents is imminent . Several concerns have already announced cuts of 15% to 20% , among these being the Midvale , Lackawanna and Lukens steel companies . Others are expected to follow . Eventually , all steel wages are expected to come down . But the probabilities are that the Corporation , which is operating at 90% capacity , with over half a year 's business ahead , while its competitors are reducing operations and many of them running out of orders , will postpone action at least until declines in commodity prices arc reflected more fully in retail quotations ; in other words , until the cost of living hllS come down to a point where a reduced money wage will not mean a lower real wage .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
