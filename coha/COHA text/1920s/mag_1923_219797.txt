On account of the unforeseen circumstances precipitated by the Supreme Court 's prohibition decision , several modifications of the Volstead Act have been proposed . Of these the two principal ones are : <P> 1 ) Amendment of the law to allow foreign ships to bring in their ship-stores of liquor under bond . Since this must wait till the next Congress convenes , serious foreign complications may arise in the meantime . <P> 2 ) Amendment of the law to prohibit American vessels from carrying liquor on the high seas as well as within the three mile limit . <P> It is generally admitted that the dry element will have the upper hand in the next Congress , although it will not be so strong as in the Congress which closed two months ago . It is predicted with some show of likelihood that proposal Number Two will pass . The wet members will probably make a hard fight for Number One and against Number Two . Comment from Washington indicates that the wets ' chances of success are not very great .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
