William Crapo Durant* is a wiry little man , 64 years old , still indomitable in the face of physical or financial blows . He was lying abed last week in the Post Graduate Hospital , Manhattan , his scalp badly lacerated from a Florida train wreck early in the month . His physicians could not keep him quiet at home ; ordered him to the hospital ; permitted him to use the telephone . He learned that some of his pet stocks-among them Baldwin Locomotive , U. S. Cast Iron Pipe , and Independent Oil &; Gas were being gnawed at on the Stock Exchange . To W. W. Murphy , his secretary , he quietly talked ; ordered large buying orders in those securities . Their board quotations climbed at once , and next day 's newspapers headlined " Sick Man Rallies Stock Market . " <P> * In 1920 Mr. Durant , reared in Michigan although born in Boston , was seemingly a man beaten financially . That year he was forced out of his controlling interests in the General Motors Co. and the Chevrolet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three years after he had organized the Buick Motor Car Co . Between 1908 and 1909 he bought the Cadillac , Oakland , Oldsmobile and Northway motor companies ; in 1915 got control of General Motors and also organized the Chevrolet Co . All these he lost at a swoop in 1920 . But the very next year he rebounded by organizing Durant Motors . He has a large following in both the automobile and the financial field .
