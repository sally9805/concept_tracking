txt Two British visitors now renewing acquaintanceship and studying current conditions in American textile circles are Arno S. Pearse , secretary of the International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners ' &; Manufacturers ' Associations and Arthur Foster , chairman of the North Lancashire Cotton Spinners ' &; Manufacturers ' Association . Both report protracted conditions of severe depression in British cotton goods industry . Lancashire , even when accepting prices for both yarns and cloth that are materially under cost of production , has been able for months to keep going only part time . Very recently this enforced curtailment has amounted to fully 50% , where prior to this year it had been only about 25% . RUHR AFFECTS TEXTILE TROUBLE The Ruhr and reparations unsettlement is the primary trouble . It has dislocated textile business in Europe , with repercussions throughout the world . Hence the growing pressure from British business upon the British govornment to move for some adjustment . In the six months elapsed since the French entered the Ruhr not only have oil textile trade channels on the Continent been blocked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-standing cotton goods equation in world trade has been disrupted . This was the triangular relation among India , Germany and Britain . India was able to buy so largely from Lancashire because of her favorable trade balance through exports to Germany , which also was the biggest single customer for British yarns . In trade with the East , embracing China and Turkey , as well as India , rise in cost of textiles has conspired with - political unsettlements to lessen volume of British business . In India , margin of native purchasing ability has been so low that higher prices were bound to lessen the takings from Lancashire . In 1920 , for example , sales made a new record , meaSured in sterling , but actually meant hi goods only a third as much as pre-war totals . Recent disturbances in China have impaired the market there . ATTEMPTS TO MEET SITUATION These serious limitations on the vital export markst have been met with the best grace possible by both capital and labor in Lancashire . Tho case was fully set before the unions , which represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement reached to continue the wages unchanged till January 25 , next . Mills have sought to give all employment possible , working at much greater loss than if they had closed completely . Besides taxes by the imperial government , high local taxes , and unemployment insurance payments have kept overhead costs high . Wages in Lancashire are based wholly on piecework , and weavers ' wages are now 95% above the standard piece price rates , as against 5% above that level in 1914 . The unions recently sought compensation for short hours , but employers could not see their way to grant it . FailAres have already been rather numerous . It is these world considerations that make the British textile visitors regard a settlement of the continental disturbances as of such vital moment to restoration of trade equilibrium . After present unsettlements are overcome it is the viewpoint of Lancashire that a closer world understanding and cooperation should exist in textiles . The International Federation , for example , now embraces practically all great textile countries save Germany and the United States . Political considerations , primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly it seemed to bo felt that there was some inherent conflict of viewpoint between American grower and European consumer . It is the British aspiration to have all interests represented , and in somewhat closer contact than afforded by occasional world " conferences . " PRO310TING COOPERATION It is from the same world viewpoint of cooperation rather than rivalry that the British Cotton Growers ' Association , as a commercial body , and the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation , as a scientific society to promote cultivation , are seeking to expand Empire cotton crops , not with a view to competition with our south but to see that the world as a whole has enough cotton to go round . From the six pence a bale fee on British consumption , now about to be enacted in Parliament , and grant of ? 1,000,000 by government , the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation expects to develop possibilities in the colonies , as it has already done in such items as supplying plows in the Uganda and providing the Kassala Railway in the Soudan . It on the same quest that Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies and in South America . At present the yield under Cotton Growing Association auspices is small ,  --  a little over 100 , . 000 bales ,  --  but it is confidently felt that a large expansion is at hand , especially with higher cotton prices .
