THUS FAR-J . C. Snaifh-Appleton ( $2.00 ) . Rushing alongside the horny-hided thriller-reader , Writer Snaith delivers pointblank a tale about a scientist who grafted the fourth dimension upon the fetus of a high anthropoid . The offspring was nerveless , bloodless , sexless , deathless , supra-intelligent and psychic . Unforturfately , it was also sadistic and clawed out a number of people 's carotid arteries , among them that of the scientist . Also unforunately , a very biological biologist and a very bemonocled amateur detective pile the book with slovenly heaps of " scientific " jargon , consisting chiefly of proper names that Writer Snaith looked up in some book or read in the newspapers . One is repeatedly told that the badinage is entirely " point-device . " Writer Snaith patches his wretched English with motley tatters of French . But the thrill 's the thing ; shut your eyes and you will surely get it . However splintery , the how drawn is one of the longest ever dragged from the woods .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
