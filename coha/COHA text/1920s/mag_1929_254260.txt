A thickset , bristle-haired man of 45 might have been observed last fortnight poking around in the mountainous backwoods of Virginia and the tangled wilderness of rural Maryland . He looked like , and was , a detective . He had been a detective ever since a day in his small-boyhood when he tossed a baseball through a basement window in the outskirts of Philadelphia and , retrieving it , discovered for U.S. agents a nest of counterfeiters . <P> Mooching quietly about in those backwoods sections , he might have been a detective looking for moonshiners . But his quarry was far more elusive than that . He was looking for , and asking for , and prepared to pay for , the right to catch-brook trout . <P> April was at hand and the trout-hunter 's mission was much more important than might have been suspected . Because he was Lawrence Richey , erstwhile of the U. S. Secret Service , lately raised to the estate of $10,000-per-year secretary to the President of the U.S. And he was looking for places where President Hoover might enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide a blanked thing until next week , " as he ( Herbert Hoover ) once put it . <P> Two spots were found : 1 ) an 18-mile stretch of the Rapidan River in Shenandoah National Park , 100 miles west by south of Washington , upon which a presidential fishing lease was arranged ; 2 ) a tract of 1,500 acres known as Catoctin Manor , 50 miles north of Washington , watered by Hunting Creek . This tract ( but not the Manor House ) was purchased in the name of Lawrence Richey . A rustic cabin will be built to receive President Hoover and his intimates . <P> Long one of the Treasury 's best sleuths , favored by President Roosevelt as a bodyguard at Oyster Bay , Detective-Secretary Richey entered Herbert Hoover 's service in Food Administration days . Bodyguarding long since ceased to be his sole function . He furnishes the Chief with a pair of extra ears as well as with vigilant eyes and brawn . When the President-Elect went to South America , Lawrence Richey was left behind to Hear Things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered by Congress and operative after July 1 . Attorney-General Mitchell had advised him that the proclamation was mandatory . Based upon a " scientific " estimate of foreign contributions to U.S. native stock in the past 140 years , national origins is viewed with alarm by President Hoover , who believes its basic statistics unsound . But said Mr. Hoover : " I naturally dislike the duty . . . . But the President of the United States must be the first to obey the law . " An effort will be made to repeal national origins in the special session of Congress , if the President mentions it in his message . <P> President Hoover has no great fancy for women in public office . Nevertheless , appreciative of her excellent work in the past , he returned to Jessie Dell , a Georgia Democrat , her resignation as a U.S. Civil Service Commissioner , thus retaining her in office . He also sent back unaccepted the resignation of General Charles Pelot Summerall , Chief of Staff .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
