Surprising to scientists as to milk-bibbers is this large list of metals present in milk : <P> Chem . Atom . Chem , Atom . <P> Symbol Wt . Symbol Wt . <P> Strontium Sr 87.63 Calcium Ca 40.07 Vanadium Va 51.0 Magnesium Mg 24.32 Rubidium Rb 85.45 Potassium K 39.10 Zinc Zn 65.37 Sodium Na 23.0 <P> Copper Cu 63.57 Iron Fe 55.84 <P> Titanium Ti 48.1 Aluminium Al 27.1 Lithium Li 6.94 Manganese Mn 54.93 <P> Also chlorine , iodine , boron and phosphorus . <P> The presence of some of those minerals in milk has long been known . But that strontium , which makes fireworks burn red , that boron , which volcanoes heave forth , that titanium , which makes war smoke screens , that vanadium , which hardens steel-that such metals of horrendous connotation were also in solution was a revelation made to U.S. householders only last week , from Cornell University . Drs . Jacob Papish and Norman C. Wright made the discoveries there with a spectroscope . The metallic contents are " small but definite . " <P> Now nutritionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be that a baby regurgitates because its milk contains too much zinc . It may be that colic comes sometimes from too much lithium .
