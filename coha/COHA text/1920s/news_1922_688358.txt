It was never transferred'to my name on the books and it seems the company does not have a. place at which the stock can be transferred . My broker writes they can not sell the stock until it is registered . Is ' there any way in which I can show loss on this stock for purposes of taxation ? ? T. IC ? Answer  --  It does not appear that the stock is an absolute loss since there is a market for it and you can take steps to have the stock transferred , either against the company or the directors , if it has gone out of existence . But the fact that the stock has value and can be sold does not make it an absolute loss . NO TAX ON LEGACN 25028 ?

The saline decision would apply to the sane question in 1916 , would it not ? I hove one case where , a claim for refund of 1916 tax having been filed , an agent audited the taxpayer 's income tax returns for 1915 to 1918 inclusive , during June , 1922 . Claim for refund was based on tax paid in error on stock dividend received that year ; but the agent in auditing 1916 found loss from sale of stock which resulted in further refund being recommended in his report , which has been sent ire , and of which we hold a copy . This loss amounted to several thousand dollars more than gains from similar transactions , and the agent allowed only the portion of the loss which was offset by the gains . Would taxpayer now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refund , asking deduction of balance of loss from dividends received in 1916 ? Or should he , if principle is correct , merely write in and object to the agent 's audit report , which he had previously accepted as correct ? The claim for refund would seem to be the better way , making ref erence in it to agent 's report and previous claim . The taxpayer had retired from business before 1916 , having at an earlier date been a steel manufacturer . His return showed income from securities of various kinds ; but I take it from your answer to 84987 that deduction of loss on sale of stock should be made from dividends received , rather than from income from bonds , etc. ? E. M. 3f . Answer  --  The loss from sale of the stock for 1916 should be allowed as an offset from all gains arising from similar transactions that year , including dividends , profit on sale of stock , etc . For the purpose of this provision it does not seem that a distinction should be made bet-v. - eel stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Investment in securities of all kinds for any one year should be regarded as a single transaction . That is , if the taxpayer in 1916 or 1917 invested in any securities , stocks , bonds , etc. , outside of his trade or business , he should be allowed to offset losses from such investment against all gains of whatever . kind derived from them , whether from dividends , or interest or upon a sale . The ruling was made in 1921 and the present law allows five years after return was due under any previous law ir which to file claim for refund . SALE OF DIVIDEND STOCK . 25034 ? In a case where a General Electric stock . holder has a block of stock bought at different times at different prices , but all bought previous to the special stock diridcnd , should the percentages you give in No. 25010 ; viz , 97.1 and 2.9 be applied to the average cost of the shares or to the total investment in the old stock and arrive at the average price of the new stock by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment ) by the total number of shares received of the new stock ? ? H. W. Answer-1n such a situation , where the stock dividend is issued on stock purchased at different times after February 28 , 1913 , and at different prices , ' each share of the dividend stock sold must be allocated to a particular lot of the purchased stock and the basis for figuring gain or loss on the sale shall be determined by using cost of the shirres to which such dividend share has been allocated . If the particular lots can not be identified , any sale of the original shares will be charged to the earliest purchases and anysale of dividend stock will be presumed to be made from stock issued with respect to your earliest purchased stock , to the amount of the dividend chargeable to such stock . In 25010 the dividend was on one blocs of stock only . ? However , if you are able to identify your various purchases , you may allocate as you wish the dividend stock , except that no share of the purchased stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dividend stock . Also , when you figure gain or loss on sale of the purchased stock you take the same basis in each case as is used in computing gain or loss front sale of dividend stock allocated to the particular lot of purchased stock sold . This is a different situation from that in 25010 and the percentages used there have nothing to do with it . The total cost of the particular lot of ' stock used , or the whole block . will be the basis and not the average cost . '
