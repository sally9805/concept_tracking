I WISH to draw a moral from the East . I take recent events in China and Turkey for my text . I want also to be , as we like to call it , constructive . I point a sure and simple way to world peace , one unencumbered by leagues and conferences and ministers and propaganda . Incidentally , I offer a solution for the vexed and perennial problem of the East , confronting us now from Turkey , now from China , now from India , now from Arabia . I propose : Take China , Turkey , India , Egypt , Persia , Morocco , the Philippines , and any other weak and undeveloped lands populated by nonwhite and therefore inferior peoples - and now ruled or coveted by powerful white empires . Strengthen them . With money , materials , moral support , men if necessary , make them independent , self-sufficient , and able by their own efforts to insure their own security . If necessary , send them our armies , navies , air forces , scientific staffs for research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be invincible , impregnable , and capable of effectively chastising those that threaten them . Then we shall have peace . More : we shall have the will to peace . For the result to ourselves will be not only a greater circumspection in our conduct toward less highly developed nations but an inner conversion with regard to the morality of the relations between great and small in the society of nations . We shall be made to perceive and appreciate moral values of which we are now ignorant or indifferent . For so moral evolution progresses with us ? but let me first elaborate in greater detail . Two truths may be set down dogmatically as unchallengeable . First , those countries whose weakness has been a temptation to competitive aggression by the imperialistic powers must cease to be a temptation or the great powers will destroy themselves in the competition . Second , the history of some hundreds of years in the East is evidence that the great powers will never cease aggression until the countries now weak are so strong that aggression is dangerous . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Morocco alone and make them secure , not out of idealism , altruism , or any other moral  | consideration but to save ourselves from suicide . And we never shall let them alone until we are afraid to do otherwise , until they can defy us successfully . ? 2 Let the two extremes of the East serve for illustration ? Turkey and China . Both have been danger-points through modern times , Turkey for centuries and China for more than a hundred years , and both still are . Numberless wars have been fought in the Near East , not only by Christian states against Turkey but between Christian states for preeminence in Turkey and the Near East . In the Far East Japan and Russia have fought within the last twenty-five years ; Germany and England have been at swords ' points , as have Russia and England , and Japan and the United States . For the moment the Near East is relatively tranquil , but it is illusory to suppose that any lasting equilibrium has been reached . It is true that Turkey is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction as a nation , but this like most miracles has its explanation in physical causes . Five years after Turkey had been crushed in the World War , left in ruins , and occupied by foreign troops , the Turks expelled their conquerors and compelled Great Britain and France to sign a treaty whereby Turkey gained more than it had lost through the war . The capitulations were abolished and foreigners no longer live on Turkish soil as independent , self-governing colonies , immune from Turkish law and taxation . The recovery is one of the most astonishing in history , but Turkey could never have recovered by its own efforts . It owes still more to an outside conjunction of events . First , Soviet Russia wanted to strike back at the Allied Powers . As Turkey was a strategic point Moscow concluded a treaty with the Nationalist Turks , who refused to recognize the peace treaty dictated by the Allies . Second and more important was the renewal of Anglo-French rivalry after the war . The military assistance given by the French to the rebellious Turkish Nationalists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly responsible for Turkey 's ability to drive out the Greek army sent to Asia Minor to forward Britain 's imperial interests . The French acted for the specific purpose of frustrating Britain 's imperial ambitions . Had the Entente been maintained in fact as well as in name and a united Anglo-French front presented to Turkey from 1919 to 1922 , there would have been a different situation in Turkey to-day . This is no new phenomenon . On the contrary , it accords with what has become a fixed law of history in the Near East . At any time in the last two hundred years there would have been a different story to tell of Constantinople had it not been for European disunity . If Turkey 's enemies had ever been able to unite , Turkey would have been driven out of Europe , deprived of Constantinople , and confined to a small area in Asia Minor . Turkey 's enemies have always hated each other more than they have hated Turkey , more even than they have coveted Constantinople . Turkey has therefore adopted the classical Oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with success . European ambitions in the Near  | East have not abated . The prizes for which powers contend there , possession of Constantinople and the straits and the ownership or right to exploit railroads , oil , and other natural resources in Asia Minor , still allure . The secret treaties of the Entente and Russia during the war and the manceuverings of the Paris peace conference were eloquent with respect to designs on Constantinople . With respect to natural resources it is necessary only to recall the furor over the Chester concessions awarded to American capitalists in 1923 , and the network of intrigue around the Mosul oil-wells , in which America also has figured . If the character of contemporary European diplomacy were not sufficient to justify an a priori conclusion , volumes of evidence could be adduced to prove that Turkey is still looked upon as a fair field for spoil . The theory propounded by Russia in the mid-nineteenth century , that Turkey was falling to pieces in any case and that Europe should expedite the process by dismembering it at once ands dividing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has not been rejected , and it has not been acted upon . To follow either course would at least make for stability , while following neither has kept the Near East in ceaseless turmoil . Obviously it can not be acted upon . While an effective concert of European states could impose any fate upon Turkey , the possibility of a concert which would not only act against Turkey but accept common aims and agree on a division of Turkey is too fantastic to be discussed in the light of the political conditions of to-day . What of Constantinople , for instance ? On that point alone unity would not survive six months . If England took Constantinople , would Soviet Russia keep its Red Army in leash ? If Soviet Russia , which can not be assumed to have renounced Russia 's historic ambition to possess Constantinople , should take the port , could even a Labor Government in England long resist the drive for war ? And France ? The first portents of British rfllastery of Constantinople in 1919 were enough to impel France to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turk Nationalists to drive out the Greeks and thus undermine the British . Is there any likelihood that any of the great powers would permit Greece or any other small East-European state to aggrandize itself by seizing Constantinople ? Internationalize the port under the League of Nations ? Look at the League of Nations . Consider how its joint control operates in the Saar . For Turkey it might be an advantage to have to give up Constantinople . It could retire into Asia Minor , entrench itself there , and be free of the tangle of European politics in which Constantinople is enmeshed . But for Europe it would be a calamity if the Turks were suddenly to renounce Constantinople and withdraw voluntarily . Within a year half of Europe would be at the throat of the other half . If the Turks were really Machiavellian and had true Oriental patience , they would withdraw . By merely biding their time they would be rid of half of their enemies and would weaken the other half without spending a piaster or losing a man , and they would get Constantinople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy that Turkey is determined to hold Constantinople ,  | and it is to be prayed that the Turks may always be victorious . Anything else would mean disaster or destruction to Europe . It is to the interest therefore not only of Turkey but of the rest of us that Constantinople be made secure and that Turkey 's strength be husbanded to keep it secure . It would be superfluous to go through the same analysis with respect to China . The story of foreign concessioneering and rival encroachments in that part of the world is too familiar . There intrigue has been matched with intrigue for this port and that , this railway and that , this special economic privilege and that . Russia got Port Arthur , and so Germany had to get Tsingtau . Germany got the right to build a railway in the north , and so Great Britain got the right to build one in the south . Great Britain got the right to supervise the customs , and so France got the right to control the post-office . In each case " wrest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The result has been general diplomatic warfare for generations , actual warfare at least twice , ? Japan and China in 1894 , and Japan and Russia in 1904 , - with internal chaos in China always . It is customary for foreign diplomats and editors to talk self-righteously about China 's ability to maintain an orderly government . It is forgotten that one of the main forces in undermining China 's government has been the meddling of foreign powers . First England towered over China , with the other empires arrayed against it ; then came Russia , with the other powers arrayed against it , and with the eventual clash with Japan ; then Japan , victorious , succeeded as the dominant power , with America challenging and the result still to be determined . So it will be ever until China is free from the menace of domination by any of them . ? 3 This brings me to the second of what I have called the two absolute truths of the East : neither Turkey nor China nor any other nation similarly placed ever will be secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world until they are strong enough to instil fear . Here China and Turkey are useful for illustration , because of the contrast between them . I had come to Turkey with years of experience in the Far East . I was therefore looking for parallels and contrasts between the two extremities of the Asiatic continent . I found both , but the contrasts were the more illuminating . I had not been in Turkey long before I was impressed by the comparative religious liberalism of the missionaries and their tolerance toward the Turks . This is not peculiar to the missionaries . Tolerance toward the lurks is characteristic also of the conduct of all European and American residents of Turkey as compared with their attitude in other Eastern countries . Throughout history there has been a marked difference in degree between the bullying of the great powers in the Far East and in Turkey . They have been rapacious and bullying in both , but they have been far more gingerly and circumspect in Turkey . The contrast , however , is more singular in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have what may be called a patent right to intolerance . Why the difference ? Why are the missionaries so much more liberal and  | tolerant in Turkey than in China , for example ? They do not cry " heathen " in Turkey . They do not force proselyting on those who are unwilling . They do not proselyte among the Moslems at all , and where they do they are tactful . They are even broad-minded about the right to proselyte . They do not force their way into houses of worship to preach their own doctrines without regard to the religious sensibilities of others . They do not ride roughshod over the feelings of those countries in which they are guests . Where they are bigoted they have learned not to voice their bigotry , and many have been broadened out of bigotry . In Turkey you will not hear missionaries gloat over their exploits as I have heard missionaries in China boast of their invasion of the native village of Confucius over the objections and pleas of his descendants . They could not be evicted because by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to sign missionaries have the right to preach anywhere in the country without regard to Chinese objections . So the missionaries stood on their legal rights , were deaf to Chinese pleas of good taste , and still continue to flaunt their victory . Indeed , they boast of their exploit as a victory for truth . Missionaries would not be heard boasting of such an episode in Turkey ; there would be no such episode in Turkey . Were they to attempt such a thing in a place sacred to Mohammed they would either be flung out of the country outright or impaled on bayonets . And as they know it , they have cultivated a respect for Moslem feelings . It is , then , an interesting commentary that with a gentle , passive , religiously tolerant people like the Chinese , the missionaries are aggressive , arrogant , inconsiderate , crudely indifferent to the feelings of the people among whom they live , and religiously bigoted ; with an aggressive , combative , fierce , religiously intolerant people like the Turks , they are considerate , tactful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own religious beliefs . Their response to contact with the obviously higher and finer civilization of the two is contempt ; to contact with the inferior of the two , it is respect . Why ? It is not accident . Nor is it a deliberate policy , nor the result of deliberate selection of personnel . The missionaries sent to Turkey are recruited from the same classes as those sent to China and Japan and India and the South Seas . They are educated in the same way and given the same preparation for their work . They begin with the same ideas , with the same rigid religious certitudes , the same ignorance of other faiths , and the same contempt for other civilizations . If , then , they act in one way toward the Chinese and in another toward the Turks it is because the Chinese are patient and do not resist while the Turks are proud and belligerent . It is the good right arm of the Turk , the broadening influence of force , that gives the missionaries tolerance and liberalism ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowledge of the consequences of illiberalism . Force ; there is the essential difference . Is it not interesting that in the last three years the missionaries in China have moderated ! Why ? There has been a serious antichristian movement in China . The missionaries , being frightened , have become broader .  | So it is also with those who are not missionaries . In Peking if I meet on the street a Chinese steeped in the culture of his own country and educated besides at Oxford or Harvard , however well bred he may be , however well born , and however high in his country 's service , I can not take him across the threshold of the Peking Club without bringing expulsion on myself . The fact that he is a Chinese bars him , though it is in the capital of his own country . In Constantinople you see Turks strolling into the reading-room of the Club de Constantinople with fezzes on their heads . They come not as guests but as members on equal footing with the British and Americans . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen or Americans . ( I except the few years after the war when the Allied troops policed Constantinople ; now that the occupation has been lifted and the civilized Occidental rule is over , a hamal bent double under a load can no longer be booted because his progress is too slow for the sailor behind him . ) You do not see on the streets of Constantinople once a month what you can see five times a day in any Chinese outport inhabited by a handful of foreigners . I have walked along a street in " down-town " Shanghai with an Englishman and seen him elbow an elderly , well-dressed Chinese into the gutter because the Chinese was walking too slowly . The Chinese picked himself up , turned around with a flush of anger , saw that it was a foreigner who had pushed him , swallowed his anger , and added his humiliation to the plenteous store of philosophy his race has had occasion to acquire ; the Englishman did not even look back . I have seen raw young American blades fresh from college riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with them whacking over the head all who came within reach ? all Chinese , that is ? whether coolies or aged scholars . I have seen uncouth bounders in gusts of passion slap the faces of shopkeepers , hotel proprietor , clerks , or priests . These are common sights . Nerves , you are told by way of explanation , the strain on the nerves from the alien and irritating ways of the Chinese . I have seen those same men in Tokio and Yokohama and other Japanese cities . How well they control themselves there ! They do not dig their toes into the small of arickshawcoolie 's back because he has taken the wrong turn , or shove old men off the walk . Why ? Not because they like the Japanese any better , surely , but because a crowd would gather in a twinkling , break their heads , and then turn then over to the police . They learn to control themselves quickly enough . Just four days from Shanghai and they can master their nerves . They control themselves quickly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , because in Turkey there has been extraterritoriality as in China , and foreigners have been answerable only to their own courts . Moreover , Turkey has not so formidable an army and navy as Japan . But the Turk , too , is no non-resister . Too much clouting over the head and shoving off the sidewalk and the Turk , too , will turn and rend . So foreigners control themselves there also . Why ? Force . As it has taught tolerance to missionaries , so it has taught decency to business men .  | So also in the realm of international relations . Whatever the powers may have done or attempted in Turkey they never have dared to go so far as they have elsewhere in the East . Until a hundred years ago they fought Turkey as an equal and respected enemy . Four hundred years ago they cringed , in fact . Only since Turkey began to lose strength have they adopted a bullying policy , and even then only under the pretext of defending the Christian subject peoples of Turkey , whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . You do not read of foreign fleets shelling ports on the Turkish coast , landing troops , and holding cities until treaties are signed at their dictation . Whole areas are never seized in compensation for the death of a foreigner who ventured where he had no right to be . Concessions to fabulously rich mining regions are not demanded , and under the shadow of naval cannon obtained , because of fancied slights to foreign dignitaries . Tfie worst humiliation put upon Turkey , the Capitulations , was not wrested by conquest . It was granted as a favor by the Sultan Suleiman when Turkey was probably the strongest empire in the world , because he did not want to be burdened with the administration of justice to people with different standards from the Turkish . As force has taught the missionary to be tolerant and the business man to be decent , so it has taught the powers to try to be just . The missionary knows that if he went into a mosque , shouted , " Heathen ! " and cried derision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken . So by contemplation of danger he has learned that other religious faiths also have their place . The business man knows that if he beats up his clerks and boots unoffending old men off the street , his throat will be cut . So by contemplation of danger he has learned that bullying is unsportsmanlike and that courtesy is due the natives of the country in which he lives . The governments of the powers know that if they stretch too rapacious a paw over Turkey it will be snapped off . The Anatolian peasant is brave and can fight , and the Turkish army must be respected . So by contemplation of danger they have learned that justice must be shown even to Oriental nations . Consider the events in China during the last few months . For years the Chinese have pleaded for greater equality with Europe and America . They have asked that the powers relinquish some of the privileges which now make China substantially a subject state . They have asked , not all , but little ; not that the powers give up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only that they allow China to determine its own tariff , only that foreigners who live in China and make their money pay some taxes to the Chinese Government , and that if foreigners live in China under the right of extraterritoriality , which makes each a little king unto himself , then the right be progressively diminished , so that ultimately China may come into the position of a sovereign nation . The Chinese have used appeals to reason and generosity . They have encountered politely expressed scorn or indifference . The treaties in which the powers so solemnly bound themselves at the Washington Conference four years ago were allowed to lie un- ratified and dead ; China 's appeals that even so much be granted received the usual response . A few months ago the Chinese arose in sudden wrath and expressed themselves in violence . They went on strike , declared boycotts against foreigners , and attacked them physically . Within four weeks the same foreign powers suddenly saw the reasonableness of the Chinese appeals . Within a few days France ratified the Washington treaties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise its tariff rates . Now a conference is to be held to discuss the eventual abolition of extraterritoriality and possibly its immediate modification . Why were those appeals so much more cogent in July than in April ? Because in the interval they had been backed with force . ? 5 Whatever may be true of their relations among themselves , the white nations in their relations with those of other races whom they consider beneath them understand , heed , and respect but one quality , force . They respond to but one form of appeal , the club , with a stout right arm behind it . Thus and thus only do you appeal to their reason , their morals , and their instincts . Hold the club ready and show that you can swing it to effect , and they will see the claims of justice and deal justly . Adopt any more decent and more civilized means of communication , and they will plunder and prey . This is not speculation in the realm of abstraction ; it is a resume of a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern peoples have become so intractable , why there is the socalled Revolt of Islam , of the non-white against the white . These peoples have had long experience and know their world . Let them weaken themselves by an ounce of their strength , let them yield an inch or relax in firmness by the smallest compromise , and they will be leaped on and destroyed . The necessity of survival compels them to be aggressive , militant , and unreasonable . The Turks have been so since they first came out of Asia . They have survived . The Chinese have not been so . They have been conquered . They are becoming so now and are at last to be treated with some dignity . What is there in this to deplore ? Is it not promise that we shall be rid of one of the main causes of war ? And shall we not , then , expedite the process ? Shall we not give to China of our superfluous battle-ships and our submarines and our airplanes as insurance for ourselves ? And to Turkey and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ourselves ? our souls ? For then we shall have become moral in our foreign relations , and it shall be accounted unto us for righteousness . I repeat , then : Let us seek out all the weak and prized places on the earth . Let us arm them and equip them with every resource of modern warfare , arm them more particularly against ourselves . We shall have peace .  |
