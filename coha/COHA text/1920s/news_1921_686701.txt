txt The Dublin correspondent of The Deily Mail telegraphs in regard to Premier Lloyd George 's letter to Eamon de Valera , the Sinn Fein leader , asking him to attend a conference in London : " I am able to state that the invitation will be accepted on conditions , but that before the conference takes place the Prime Minister will have to give more binding guarantees as to safe conduct for Michael Collins , the Sinn Fein Commander-in iChief ; Richard Mulcahy , the Chief of Staff , and any others whom de Valera may desire to bring with him . " In the view of the Sinn Fein such guarantees are indispensable and equally indispensable to such a conference is the presence of several Republicans , who were described in the House of Commons a month or so ago as murderers . " A prominent Irishman today told me that peace in Ireland was possible if the Government would agree to the following : " That Ireland should govern herself , excluding only foreign relations the army , navy and other strategical considerations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rest of Ireland such measure Of self-government as de Valera has already said Sinn Fein was willing to concede within the limits of a self-gbverning Ireland . " The Dublin correspondent of The Morning Post declarer that the Premier 's letter to de Valera " is interpreted as a confession of failure on the part of the British Cabinet and Lloyd George is Pictured in attitude of penitence , suing the Republican leader for peace at any price . " Even if de 7. alera , accepts the invitation , this correspondent adds , there is very little hope in Dublin that anything tangible will result toward peace . Other dispatches say the feeling in Dublin is one of optimism , and the ex ' pectation is that the Premier 's offer will be accepted : If so , it is generally thought in Dublin , says one dispatch , that de Valera may choose as his colleague Arthur Griffith , Sinn Fein Vice President , who is now in Mount Joy Prison . Reply Unlikely for Several Days . No reply is expected until de Valera had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may hang ir , the balance for a few days . It is stated that the Premier 's invitation was published in the papers before it reached the Sinn Fein leader , but that the latter has now received it and is considering it The fact that more troops are being sent to Ireland as a result of the outrage on the troop train at Adavoyle is not considered to conflict with Lloyd George 's offer of a conference . In fact . says one Dublin correspondent , many people think that if a settlement is reached de Valera will need the assistance of troops and the Royal Irish Constabulary to enforce his own and the Dail Eireann 's wishes on his own people . As regards the Government 's intention to take the strongest measures against extremists in Ireland while at the same time inviting representatives of the Sins Feiners to a conference , the Daily Chronicle 's political correspondent says : " It is contended in ministerial circles that it is a misnomer to call this policy an offer of the olive branch with the sword . Some ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed are called for against the extremists . Such measures , like the attack on a troop train at Adavoyle , . are acts of war , but neither are to prevent the call to a conference . " It is pointed out here that the offer given to de Valera extends a truce to other Sinn Fein leaders , and any one chosen by de Valera would be admitted to the conference even if he is now in prison . In the meantime , the Lord Lieutenant has issued the notice summoning the Southern Irish Parliament to meet in Dublin on Tuesday . There is little doubt , however , that the meeting will not take place because 124 of the 128 members of the lower house are Sinn Feiners who have expressed their determination not to attend . Forty-three members of the house are in prison or interned and forty-one are ' on the run . " But a fortnight 's grace for the opening of the Southern Parliament is given under the Home Rule act , so there will be time to see before then whether there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DUBLIN , June 26 ( Associated Press ) . ? Aftec a day of conferences with colleagues in connection with Premier Lloyd George 's letter , it was said this evening that Mr. de Valera 's talks had not been completed , and that possibly a meeting of the Dail Eireann members might be considered essential to the situation . Mr. de Valera today served at mass and took breakfast at Black Rock College , where at one time he used to teach . In Sinn Fein circles it is considered probable that if Mr. de Valera goes to London to confer with Prime Minister Lloyd George and Premier Craig of Ulster , one colleague he will take along will be John Joseph , Member of Parliament representing Longford , who recently was tried by court-martial on a charge of murdering District Inspector . The Premier 's letter was variously discussed here today . One high Sinn Feiner said he thought it an insult and as implying acceptance of partition . Other political leaders saw in the letter an abandonment by the Premier of his repeated bar against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , would be free to choose any colleagues he pleases , even men under sentence by court-martial . Cardinal Logue , Primate of Ireland , said he could not see much use of a conference between Sir James Craig and Mr. de Valera , but as the Government also was involved there might be some hope , although it would be desirable for the Government to release from prison Moderates like Arthur Griffith , founder of the Sinn Fein . Ulster Cabinet Is Called . BELFAST , Ireland , June 26 ( Associated Press ) ? A meeting of the Ulster Cabinet has been called for Tuesday by Sir James Craig , the Premier , to consider the letter of Prime Minister Lloyd George inviting the leaders of North and South Ireland to a conference for the purpose of trying to bring about a reconciliation between the factions in Ireland . The letter of Mr. Lloyd George reached Sir James Craig by special courier this morning , simultaneously with the Sunday newspapers commenting on the letter . Sir James replied immediately , informing Mr. Lloyd George that he was summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he hoped to secure the attendance of all the members . " You may rest assured no time will be lost in conveying the result of our deliberations , " the message of Sir James concluded . Today Sir James was in conference with his chief supporters . The general feeling in Belfast is that the Ulster men will demand that the terms to be discussed at the proposed conference shall be strictly limited , especially excluding the subject of a republic . Sir James Craig and the members of his Cabinet received through the Associated Press the first intimation that Premier Lloyd George had issued an invitation for e conference between representatives of the British Government of the Governments of Northern and Southern Ireland . Sir James and his Ministers expressed surprise that the letters of invitation from Mr. Lloyd George to Sir James and Eamon de Valera had been launched through the medium of the press before those invited to the conference were first sounded regarding the acceptability of such a project . It was said that acceptance of the invitation most probably would be given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation be limited to the position of Ireland within the empire .

Sprei-.1 LONDON , Monday , June n7.  - -  The Daily Chronicle says that Lloyd George 's offer to de Valera " disposes of many absurdities that were uttered in some quarters last week about the Prime Minister 's alleged resolve to listen to no terms and to pursue no path but that of repression . " It proceeds : f " The great object upon which the Prime Minister will concentrate his e - for if this conference takes place is to secure an agreement between de Valera and Sir James Craig  --  such an agreement as they can confidently recommend to the Dail Eireann and the Ulster Parliament . For the real points at issue are now , and always have been , not differences between the British Gov-ernment and Ireland , but between the North and South . If these can be resolved and the spirit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment than it has ever been before , then we believe the British Parliament can safely be recommended to pass legislation modifying the present act . " The Daily News says : . " It is for Irishmen to remember that the proposal is made in the name of the British people on the constitutional initiative of the King and in the presence of the Dominion Prime Ministers and that , once having made it , the Government is responsible to these as well as to Ireland for vigorous , candid and effective prosecution of the new policy . Let De Valera take the Prime Minister at his word and rely upon these to see that it is made good . " The Belfast News Letter in an editorial article , seeks to allay any fears that may be entertained by Unionists that questions of an Irish Republic or the abandonment of the Northern Irish Parliament will be discussed at the London conference , if such is held . It says : " ' What It comes to is this : Are the Sinn Fein leaders prepared to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandonment of their demand for a Republic and acceptance of the Government of Ireland act ? That must be so or else the Imperial Government would be traitors to , us and to the King , for that is ' he basis of the King 's appeal for a settiernent . " Morning Post Attacks Proposal . All the other morning papers with one exception welcome Lloyd George 's offer to De Valera as a sincere effort to bring about a peaceful solution of the Irish problem . The one exception is the Morning Post . It publishes a bitter leading article under the caption of " Your Obedient Servant , " which is how the Premier signed himself in his letter to De Valera . That paper says that in considering the letter it is first necessary to say who De Valera is . It proceeds : " He is called and calls himself President of the Irish Republic and , as is well known in Ireland , was given this title for his share in the Easter week rebellion , where he is known to have had the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not , perhaps , so well known that he obtained ill-deserved clemency by the plea that he was an alien and an American subject , that in fact he saved his life by denying the country of which he now claims to be Chief Magistrate . " He is , in fact , as much an Irishman as Trotzky is - Russian , and no doubt was made President less in honor to himself than in derision of our King and our Government . " Royal clemency had no effect on the desperate courses of this adventurer . Both in the United States and in Ireland he has continued to work against us and is now , at least , the titular chief of a clandestine government which daily murders many of the King 's most faithful subjects and has established a reign of terror in Ireland . " The Prime Minister 's letter to De Valera is , we venture to say , unprecedented in the history of this country . It is an appeal for peace by- the Government to a rebel , and as the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , this gesture of supplication will be taken as a sign of weakness in India , in Egypt , and everywhere that the enemies of England work at the same cause  --  as De Valera ? the destruction of the British Empire . By the rebels In Ireland it will be regarded as the S. 0 . S. of the British Government . " " Hour of Peace Has Struck . " LONDON , Monday , June 27 . ? While there is some harsh comment by the irreconcilables , the majority of the London morning papers warmly approve the Prime Minister 's invitation to Mr. de Valera and Sir James Craig , which they regard as a logical sequel to the King 's generous appeal . Opinions with regard to the outcome hover between hope and fear . The London nines declares that " the hour of peace has struck for Ireland . " It says of the Premier 's letter to Mr. de Valera : " It breathes a spirit of conciliation which too often has been absent in the dealings of the Government with Ireland . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take exception . In manner , as well as in substance , it is in accord with the King 's speech . If its tone governs the negotiations , which we earnestly hope will follow , the dawn of a new understanding may be at hand , ' a dawn In whose light recoppillation and peace may be achieved . " The London Times finds it impossible to forecast Mr. de Valera 's answer , but can not imagine that he would commit " such a grave error " as to refuse the invitation , a decision which the paper believes many Sinn Feiners would learn with " heartbreaking disappointment . " It conceives the possibility that Mr. de Valera will give conditional acceptance , asking for a truce pending negotiations . The Daily Telegraph says that the most fervid advocates of reconciliation can not complain of anything in the tone of the Premier 's letter to Mr. de Valera which would indicate either lack of sincerity or serve as an , excuse for nonacceptance . " Its chief value , " continues the paper , " lies in the proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been unjustly challenged and doubted . It rests with the Sinn Fein to come into the open and meet the representatives of the Government and the northern Parliament and show in its turn the sincerity of its desire to live in peace with Great Britain . " Recalling previous disappointments , The Telegraph " indulges in no undue hope of the success of - the latest move of the British Government . " It is confident that the moderate Sinn Feiners will desire that Mr. de Valera accept , but says that a vital factor is to what extent Mr. de Valera is in the hands of irreconcilabies . " If he refuses , " the paper adds , " it can only be because he is not allowed to accept and because he dare not disobey his masters . " - The Daily Herald ( Labor ) , declares that the Premier 's assumption that Ireland consists of two parts may prove sufficient to preclude all possibility of the invitation being accepted . It also contends that negotiations can not is erly be undertaken until a truce s arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect too much from the invitation , " says The Herald . " We do not consider the Premier 's offer nearly so generous as from the terms of his letter he would make it appear . The Irish people have by their unexampled heroism given Great Britain only one choice  --  to do right . " Nationalist Papers Applaud . DUBLIN , June ** Freeman 's Journal , commenting on the invitation of Mr. Lloyd George to the Sinn Fein and Ulster leaders , says : " The Premier has gone further than he or his colleagues ever have gone in public . Mr. Lloyd George has at last seen the wisdom of dispensing with - conditions and restrictions which hitherto have proved insuperable barriers to negotiations . " No limitations arc . imposed either regarding the matters to be discussed or the men selected to discuse them . This is a definite important advance .

Naturally , their opinion must be ascertained , and if Mr. de Valera. desires to confer with them the Government can not refuse their release . " The six counties are to be openly and fully represented at the meetings .

If the Government mean business they will act frankly and boldly , turning a deaf ear to counsellors who mediate double dealing or seek to take the stand on points of punctilio . " Sincerity and openness are the best solvents of suspicion . If they are displayed the British Government will not find Ireland lacking in responsiveness . We are confident also that Mr. de Valera and his colleagues will not stand on punctilio , but will view the problem in its broad aspect . " The Sunday Independent , referring to the letter , says : " Tne Premier 's letter is a document of the greatest political importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have insisted upon  --  that an honorable peace in Ireland is achievable only ' through direct negotiations with the elected representatives .

Special to The New York Times . CHICAGO , June ** - Lloyd George 's invitation to Eamon de Valera and Sir James Craig , Premier of Ulster . to attend a peace parley in London was ridiculed today at the forty-sixth annual convention of the United Irish Societies of Chicago .
