txt Defects in the present bonding system , which permit criminals to operate while out on ball awaiting trial , and the apparent need for higher ball in cases of crimes of violence , were brought to the attention of the public yesterday when Judge John F. In General Sessions held Lawrence zinwtnorne , Lae Hotel Astor burglar , in $100,000 bond for trial . This is one of the largest bonds for a crime of this kind in the history of the criminkl courts . It was hailed with approval by the Police and the District Attorney 's office , and as part of the same movement to make it harder for criminals awaiting trial to get out and repeat their crimes District Attorney Swann instructed his assistants in the Magistrates ' Courts to ask . for high bail in all cases of robbery and burglary . " That 's the stuff ! " exclaimed George A. Lavelle , Assistant District Attorney in charge of the ' rail bond bureau , who for ten years has been waging a fight against ball abuses . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crime wave . " There was a strongly dissenting opinion , however , from Magistrate Joseph E. Corrigan . He characterized the statement that much of the present crime is committed by men out on ball , and is due to the low ball so often fixed in primes of violence , as " stuff and nonsense , " and said the way to stop a crime wave is to cut out sentimentality about criminals and " treat them rough . " Few Professional Bondsmen . There are only ? a few professional bondsmen now in New York , not more than five or six , Mr. Lavelle believes . Most of the bonding which used to be done by professional bondsmen using real estate  --  the bonding of crooks with known records  --  is done , it is said , by several small bonding concerns which have sprung up since the bail bond bureau in the District Attorney 's office became a live institution . But there are some larger companies that also do a criminal bonding business . Across the street from the Criminal Court Building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conducted solely for bonding in criminal cases , it is declared . They handle 15 per cent . of the bonding dope in the higher criminal courts , which amounted this year to $4,500,000 up to Nov. 1 . It is the largest amount of bail given in any one year in the history of the courts , according to Mr. Lavelle . It is much more difficult to get a real estate bond now than a surety bond , because of the careful inspection of ouch bonds by the bonding bureau . But any cash bond from a surety company must be accepted , and the companies are gent erally secured by cash and , nowadays , Liberty bonds . It is not often that a crook goes back on his bond , it is declared , for it is recognized that for their protection the next time they get into trouble they must rely again on the bonding ? agents and the entire underworld crowd helps to protect the bondsman . " It only costs these men a few hundred dollars to get even a big bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . , " The charge made by . the bonding company is usually 2 per cent. , only $200 for a $10,000 bond , and tt the broker gets ' a. 2 or 3 per cent . rake-off that does n't make it out of the reach of the successful crook . And then . when we have these follows packed away as we think for a few months awaiting trial , we run up against them doing another job . We ca n't keep them in jail . They wo n't stay put " Mr. Lavelle told of a case which had recently come to his attention in which a man held in the lower court and awaiting trial , committed another crime while he was on bail , was tried for this second crime and got a disagreement , and then went out and committed a third offense . " Then I heard of it , and managed to get the bail put up so high that he was kept until wanted , " said Mr. Lavelle . " I have never yet asked higher bail that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed high for sectheir first ball is apt to be nominal , ' and that they have committed another and offenders , but the trouble is that crime before the case comes again to my attention . " Whatever the reason , it is certain that , despite all the vigilance of the officials , many crooks are held in low bail , which permits them to roam the city and collect enough by further depredations to pay the price of their bail bond . " Stuff and nonsense ! " exclaimed Magistrate Corrigan when he was asked what he thought was the effect of permitting criminals to obtain bail in nominal amount . " Any attempt to show that low bail is the cause of crime , or even a partial cause , is ridiculous . The real cause of crime is foolish sentimentality and ' sob stuff ' over crooks who should be treated as if they are crooks . " The only effect raising the bail bonds will have will be to increase the fees of the . bonding companies and to increase the opportunities of the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive to buy a big bond , he will be more inclined to give up to the policemen for protection . There is altogether too much sob stuff and sympathy for the crook , and the only way to stop crime is to forget the probations and suspended sentences and treat them rough . Since Tom Osborne first messed things up there has n't been a decent enforcement of the ' law . All these suspended crooks have to do is write a letter to the probation officer once a week , telling all the lies that occur to them . I have had men come before me for all kinds of crimes who had been writing these letters telling how good they were . " It is true that the bonding companies are a source of evil . They have almost a monopoly of the bonding in the lower courts , for any one can form a company and get permission to do business . But so log as there are certain sentimental thine &; such as bail , which a criminal Is entitled to , there are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cause a man to appear in court . Bail of $2,000 or 32,500 in the Magistrates ' Courts will generally bring that about , and the imposition of any higher bail is in the nature of punishment which is contrary to the theory of the law . Of course , if you want to have a law -. passed that criminals are to be held without bail , that is another thing , and then people would cry that the criminal was being hounded . There are plenty of laws to bring about order if there were men capable of enforcing them . This condition makes me sick . " The instructions mimed by District Attorney Swann to his assistants directed them to urge heavier bail in all cases of robbery and burglary , giving as his opinion that in no case of that character should the bail be less than $10,000 . On Monday ' he will ask the Court of General Sessions to take from the court 's calendar every case of burglary and robbery and place it on a special calendar for immediate trial out of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such cases as soon as they are reached . Prison cases are heard first , and the cases of those on ball come after the others are disposed of .
