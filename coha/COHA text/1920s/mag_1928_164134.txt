Between Capitol Hill and the Hudson River , stretching five or six blocks south of busy , important State Street , is that district of Albany known as " The Gut . " The underworld of many a city knows " The Gut " and draws gangsters from it , contributes gangsters to it . Women without escorts do not walk through " The Gut , " by day or by night . The district is " segregated , " and over it rules a Democratic ward politician , unofficial boss of Albany County , close friend of Lieut . Gov . Edwin Corning , by name Daniel P. O'Connell . <P> Great was the regret of short , round-faced Boss O'Connell when the spatter of bullets broke the peace of his demesne on an early morning of last week . Into the heart of " The Gut " had marched Prohibition Agents Irving Washburn and Wilfred Grisson , bent on arrest . Suddenly , a group swarmed from an open doorway . Guns were drawn , fired . Agent Grisson escaped uninjured . But Agent Washburn fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shots were heard many miles from Albany . This had been no ordinary Prohibition raid . A very definite understanding had existed between the Federal agents and Boss O'Connell . If not molested , " The Gut " had promised to restrain itself from too-overt alcohol smugglings and rowdy boozings . Following the political tirades of Theodore Roosevelt the younger that a slimy trail of vice and corruption had crawled " to the very steps of the State Capitol , " Boss O'Connell and his friends had been " making character " for the sake of Governor Smith . <P> Last week 's visit by Agents Washburn and Grisson seemed to indicate pressure from high Federal powers . " The Gut 's " murderous loss of self-control boded ill for the Brown Derby .
