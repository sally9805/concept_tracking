When the Public Lands Committee of the Senate was trying , last year , to find out what became , in 1921 , of the profits of the Continental Trading Co. ( side-spout of the Teapot Dome oil mess ) , it asked Col. Robert W. Stewart , chief of the Standard Oil Co. of Indiana and stout friend of Oilman Sinclair , if he had " received " any of the Continental profits . " No , " answered Oilman Stewart . He declined to say if he knew anyone who did " receive " the profits . For his silence the Senate indicted Col. Stewart for contempt . Also having learned that one-fourth of the Continental profits had been delivered to Col. Stewart the Senate indicted Col. Stewart for perjury . His explanation was that by " received " he thought the Senators had meant " profited personally . " He admitted he had " received " the profits physically , " as a messenger boy " and conveyed them to his company . <P> Acquitted , last spring , of contempt , Col. Stewart went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , he was acquitted , or at least " aquibbled . " Conducted by " million-dollar " counsel ( small , snappy , whitehaired Lawyer Frank J. Hogan ) , the Stewart defense succeeded in shifting the crux of the case from the honesty of Col. Stewart 's double interpretation of the verb , " to receive , " to the legality of the Senators ' second questioning of Col. Stewart . Chairman of the Public Lands Committee at the time of the second Stewart hearing was boyish , officious , inexperienced Senator Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota . It was an easy matter for the defense to impress the jury with the incompetence with which the hearing was conducted . The official stenographic record was riddled with errors and omissions . Roll calls had not been taken . Questions had been suggested in the hearing room by newsgatherers and put by the Senators . Finally , the defense represented that , though the Committee had decided that eight of its 15 members should constitute a quorum , there were not eight Senators physically present at the time Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by telephone their assent to their colleagues ' doings-a procedure formally recognized in the Senate since 1919 . <P> Justice Jennings Bailey ( District of Columbia Supreme Court ) instructed the jury that unless it decided there were eight Senators physically present , the verdict must be not guilty . Thus , the ingenuousness of Col. Stewart was never passed upon . The jurors ( three of them women ) came in after 55 minutes , congratulated Col. Stewart , patted his broad back . <P> Chairman George W. Norris of the Senate Judiciary Committee was thoroughly disgusted with Justice Jennings Bailey . If the Bailey theory of quorums is right , " 95 per cent of all State and national legislation would be nullified , " said Senator Norris . " All the legislatures in the civilized world operate without physical quorums . Unless there was a fight on the Judge Bailey himself , he probably was not confirmed by a quorum and therefore , under his interpretation , he is not a judge . . . . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
