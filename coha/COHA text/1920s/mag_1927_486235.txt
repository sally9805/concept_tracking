M R. HEARST 'S character , or lack of it , has long been known of all men who cared to study him . His journals have portrayed it in yellow and black , year in and year out . It is not often , however , that he paints himself as a journalist as clearly as he did when called before the Senate Committee on December 15 to inquire into his charges that $1,240,000 was taken from the Mexican treasury ostensibly to line the pockets of four United States Senators , together with other sums to procure the editor of The Nation , another editor as yet unnamed , and a newspaper syndicate likewise unnamed , for the Mexican cause . On the witness stand , under oath , there ensued the following colloquy : Q. Now , Mr. Hearst , when did you get the papers which contained the names of United States Senators ? Were they in the first batch ? A. They were in the first batch . Q. What investigation , if any , did you make to ascertain whether payments actually reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not make any investitions without entirely disclosing the documents . Q. Well , did you make any ? A. No . Q. Did you interview any of these Senators to find out their side of the transaction ? A. No . Q. Did you make any investigation to find out whether the money mentioned , in certain telegrams here had actually been transmitted by telegraph to New York ? A. I think we tried to make such investigations . . . . Q. Have you obtained any evidence which indicates any Senator accepted any payment mentioned in these letters ? A. No . Q. Have you any reason to believe that any Senator did accept any such money ? A. I have no reason to believe it at all . As a matter of fact I do not believe it . I believe they did not . That is my personal opinion . Q. Have you any evidence or have you heard of any evidence to show that any of these Senators knew anything about this transaction ? A. No . Q. How much did you pay in all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15,000 or $16,000 . Q. That was paid in instalments as the letters came along , was it ? A. Yes . We here have Mr. Hearst confessing that he printed documents falsely assailing the honor of American public men although he did not believe in their truth , admitting that he did not make any investigation whatever , so far as the Senators were concerned , to ascertain what the Senators themselves had to say about these charges . His pretense is that he published them with , the names deleted , as he printed that affecting the honor of The Nation and its editor , in order to force a Congressional investigation . He was willing and ready to set afloat thereby a host of rumors which filled the lobbies at Washington and affected . far more men than the four Senators named  --  in order , he says , to clear the honor of our public men ! It is too thin . Honor and Mr. Hearst have too long been strangers to make it appear that they are now bedfellows . He printed those documents because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose his investment . He was after sensations to increase the circulation of his journals , and he took a chance of escaping libel suits by blotting out the names of the men he was willing to traduce . We do not believe that in the history of American journalism there has been more dastardly conduct in the responsible owner of an American newspaper . He has shown himself , as the New York World points out , unfair , cowardly , without scruple , and beneath contempt . These adjectives and more besides he would merit if his publication concerned only the honor of the men directly affected . He deserves a still worse branding because the matter profoundly affects two great nations . The whole series of these documents which began with an attempt to show that Mexico had been taking sides against us in the Nicaraguan imbroglio was as if planned to injure the friendly relations between Mexico and the United States . For years past Mr. Hearst 's course as to Mexico has been tortuous in the extreme . On May 3 , 1916 , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Mexico as the symbol of the rehabilitation of that unhappy country and its redemption to ' humanity ' and civilization . Our right in Mexico is the right of humanity . " But on February 7 , 1922 , this devil a monk would be .. He then asked plaintively a question particularly apropos in view of his latest performance : " Every human interest that appeals to a nation calls on us to do justice to Mexico  --  politics , diplomacy , business , national defense . . . . Why inflict conspiracy and injuries on a government that is trying to be friendly and from whose friendship we can derive only benefit ? " Now he prints doctored documents , the dates of one of which he alters and " touches up " between editions , and seeks to spread abroad the belief that Mexico is bent upon corrupting for her own purposes the public men of America . We do not know if he was moved to this because of anger over his failure to have the titles to his Chihuahuan lands confirmed , as is alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . He admitted on the witness stand that he feared the libel law if he printed the names of those involved and he sought to break the force of this admission by asserting that he , as a great property-owner in Mexico , had much more to lose by printing these documents . They might , he suggested , lead to hostilities against him in Mexico . Well , they ought to lead to hostilities against him wherever decent men are assembled , wherever men have some regard for the honor of their country and the integrity of their public men . We have enough admitted sins by American public officials to answer for , heaven knows , without having baseless suspicions set on foot without the slightest attempt at an adequate inquiry . As a matter of fact , wherever we have heard the case discussed there has been only one opinion voiced  --  that the Senate Committee should sift the entire matter from top to bottom and find out the motives behind it , and that if any law exists against such scandalous journalism that law should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools and hirelings . We believe that there will be universal agreement with Senator Norris 's public letter to Mr. Hearst in which he declares that Hearst 's record in this case is sufficient to place your publications in disrepute in the minds of all honest men , and it demonstrates that the Hearst system of newspapers , spreading like a venomous web to all parts of our country , constitutes the sewer system of American journalism . Selling Jesus T HE Bible , Mr. Bruce Barton has told the world , is the book nobody ( except Mr. Bruce Barton ) knows , and Jesus is the man nobody ( except Mr. Bruce Barton ) knows . But his publishers , and the Review of Reviews Corporation , which offers Mr. Barton 's books cheap with an eighteen months ' subscription to their magazine , intend that everybody shall know what Mr. Bruce Barton knows . They intend to " sell " Jesus  --  or Mr. Bruce Barton 's picture of Jesus . " The Discovery of Jesus , " they head their circular . Mr. Barton , it appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version ; he studied the texts ; he got the - dope . Hence the books  --  and the advertising copy . We quote : Jesus . . . a killjoy ? He was the most popular dinner guest in Jerusalem . He was criticized because He enjoyed society too much . A failure ? He picked up twelve men and forged them into an organization that conquered the world . When the business man finished reading Jesus 's own words , he exclaimed " This is a man nobody knows . Some day someone will write a book about Jesus . Every business man will read it and send it to his partners and salesmen , for it will tell the story of the founder of modern business . " - Bruce Barton , we learn , was the business man , and finally he wrote the book himself . Perhaps he also wrote the advertising copy for it . We quote again : Jesus was a real executive . . . a great advertising man . .. . The parables are the greatest advertisements of all time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talk and work . The story , the copy-writer says , is " the most exalted success story of all time . " " Barton found that Jesus developed three rules for gaining success in any business . " " Only strong , magnetic men build great organizations . He built the greatest organization of all . " ( The copy-reader should have looked up the history of St. Paul . ) " Every employer in the United States , " we learn , " ought to send copies of these books to the ten most valuable men in his organization . " ( Why only ten ? ) " They would give them a new thrilling conception of modern business . " But it is in the accompanying mimeographed letter that the copy-writer reached his peak . Once more we quote : DEAR READER : Jesus Christ " the founder of modern business " ? Jesus a master of efficiency in organization , a born executive ? - Jesus a sociable man , a cheerful , bright companion with a pat story on His lips . . . wording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's two books interest and aid the rich and powerful ; they help any cub salesman to get orders for shoe polish  --  and to work on principles that lead him toward riches and power . Riches and power  --  and orders for shoe polish . There was once a man who talked differently . " Blessed are the meek , " he said . " Why take ye thought for raiment ? " " Ye can not serve God and Mammon . " " Go and sell all that thou hast , and give to the poor . " " Verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven . " " It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needlethan for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . " And in one terrible passage : " Woe unto ye , scribes and Pharisees . . . . " - Railroading or Stockjobbing ? W ITH the country at the threshold of important rail- road consolidations and groupings , authorized by the Transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce Commission shall insist that these new opportunities be used in the public interest , as the law provides , and not to stifle competition or pile up profits through speculation in stocks for railway officers and bankers . The Transportation Act does not repeal the Sherman and Clayton antitrust laws which forbid a railroad to acquire control of a competing line through stock ownership . The newer legislation merely empowers the Interstate Commerce Commission to suspend the provisions of the older acts when it thinks this would be in the public interest . But railroad attorneys and bankers have stepped way beyond this . They have interpreted the Transportation Act as giving one road a right to acquire anything short of a majority ownership in a competitor before applying to the Interstate Commerce Commission , on the ground that otherwise the price might be raised to a prohibitive point . This looks like a clear violation of the anti-trust statutes even if the purpose be legitimate  --  which is doubtful . Practical control of most companies can be obtained through holding less than a majority of the stock . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or somewhat less ) as 51 per cent . It is bad enough if a railroad , having violated the law in advance of its application to the Interstate Commerce Commission , obtains the approval of that body for its acquisitions , but it becomes doubly dangerous if the proposed arrangement is disallowed . A striking example is found in the recent history of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company , which operates about 1,000 miles of railroad between St. Louis and Shreveport , Louisiana . The St. Louis Southwestern , popularly known as the Cotton Belt , has been out of the control of its stockholders  --  and in that of its competitors  --  for nearly three years , most of this time subsequent to denials by the Interstate Commerce Commission of applications to acquire the road . Five months ago Walter E. Meyer , a minority stockholder in the Cotton Belt , asked the commission to proceed under the Clayton Act to compel the railroad 's competitors to divest themselves- of its stock , but no action has been taken . - In March , 1925 , Edwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sold his interest to the Rock Island . That railroad then applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission- to do what it had already done  --  acquire stock control of a competitor . The application was denied the following August as against the public interest . Thereupon the Rock Island sold its holdings to the Kansas City Southern  --  another competitor of the St. Louis Southwestern . The Kansas City Southern , headed by L. F. Loree , had previously acquired a third of the stock of the Missouri , Kansas and Texas , popularly known as the Katy . Mr. Loree arranged to have the Katy take over the Kansas City Southern 's 155,000 shares of Cotton Belt stock and later asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to 0 . K. his plans . On May 3 , last , the application was denied by the commission as against the public interest , the following passage in the decision revealing the intricate financial methods resorted to : Between January 27 and February 26 , 1926 , and after the Kansas City Southern had thus acquired practical control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 shares of the common stock of the M. K. &; T. Witnesses for the applicants stated that this purchase was in pursuance of a plan for the control of the M. K.- &; T. by the Kansas City Southern and Cotton Belt jointly , with the object of distributing the financial burden , but that as their counsel advised that there might be some question as to the legality of such control , it was decided that these 100,000 shares should be transferred to the Kansas City Southern . At the annual meeting of the stockholders of the M. K. &; T. on April 9 , 1926 , the number of shares voted was 893,047 or 82.15 per cent of the total . Of these the Kansas City Southern voted as owned or through proxies 557,134 shares , including apparently the 100,000 shares owned by the Cotton Belt , or 51.25 per cent of the outstanding stock and 62.39 per cent of the total shares voted , and , as Loree testified , " the Kansas City Southern took control of the property , electing representatives from the group that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further testified that a majority of the M. K. &; T. directors were elected at the instance of the Kansas City Southern . The record also shows that the ten directors present at the meeting of the board of the M. K. &; T. held on July 21 , 1926 , at which the resolution authorizing the company to acquire the 155,000 shares of Cotton Belt stock was adopted , held only 200 shares of the preferred and 1,310 shares of the common stock of the M. K. &; T. , of which 700 shares of common stock were held for account of the Kansas City Southern . But according to the brief submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission last August by Mr. Meyer , in behalf of himself and other minority stockholders , the situation was even worse than indicated in the commission 's statement . Mr. Meyer said : The total outstanding capitalization of St. Louis Southwestern consists of 198,936 shares of preferred and 163,561 shares of common stock ; both preferred and - common have equal voting rights . At the time of the annual election the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned 135,000 shares of St. Louis Southwestern preferred and 20,000 shares of St. Louis Southwestern common . Messrs . Kuhn , Loeb &; Company and Ladenburg , Thalmann &; Company , banking advisers of the Kansas City Southern , owned 40 , - 000 shares of the common . Thus , the roads in control and their banking advisers were the owners of 195,000 shares out of the total of 362,497 shares outstanding capital stock , amounting to over 51 per cent thereof . The opportunities for stockjobbing and profits for insiders in transactions like these are obvious . It may be impossible to prevent railroad officers from speculating individually in the possibilities arising through changing control , but they stand to lose if the Interstate Commerce Commission disapproves- the plans . On the other hand , if railway officers commit their companies to the purchase of stocks , these men guarantee their speculations at the expense of the shareholders if the purchases result in losses . In its recent report to Congress the Interstate Commerce Commission asks for wider powers in connection with consolidations and stock acquisition among the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have sufficient authority already to end such flagrant abuses as those here described . Why not use it ? Women and Artists 0 NE thousand of the foremost musicians and music-lovers of New York came together on December 18 to rejoice in the fiftieth anniversary of Marcella Sembrich 's first appearance on the stage . Whom did they praise ? A great artist , of course ; but a greater woman . For here is one who , born in the simplest of Polish peasant homes , has possessed beauty and charm as well as musical genius , but never in her long life was she ever deprived of poise or swollen to conceit by her great fame and success or by the applause of a united musical wo rld . Her charm , her simplicity , her inborn kindliness and unselfishness  --  these are today as fresh and untainted as her rare artistry itself . Unwilling even now to indulge herself by ease , unable to detach herself from her o'erweening passion for struggling musicianly youth , she teaches in winter at two great musical institutions , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm of her art . Throughout the audience were past and present pupils bringing to her a devotion and a love such as comes only to the greatest teachers . Thirty years on the operatic stage , of which twenty-five were spent at the Metropolitan Opera in New York ; ten years upon the concert stage ; and now another ten as a teacher  --  such is the record of Madame Sembrich . She was of the galaxy of artists which opened the Metropolitan in 1883 , and pictures of her in no less than twenty-nine operatic roles adorned the program of the dinner in her honor  --  a record surpassed in length by others , but surely by none in versatility . Mistress of the Italian art of coloratura singing , she turned , as one of the speakers said , from the operatic stage to the deeper art of interpreting the great deathless songs of the European peoples with a success that would alone insure her permanent fame if she had not secured herself a lasting place in musical annals by those exquisite , winsome , and charming appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required by modern audiences in every role she essayed . Now they call her the greatest of teachers , a true mother to her pupils . She still can not bear to hurt an aspirant for musical honors . Once she sent , without previous consultation , to another teacher a student who bawled so abominably that there seemed no hope whatever for her . " Madame X will tell you what I think , " said Madame Sembrich . Madame X guessed when the pupil came , but decided to try what could be done . Two years later when she and Madame X met for the first time thereafter Sembrich 's first question was for the girl who had seemed so hopeless . Next to Madame Sembrich sat another wonderful veteran , Ernestine Schumann-Heink , a true American who has repaid a thousand times in her patriotic devotion what America has done for her . There again the great woman and the great artist united in a sturdy character , united in kindliness . She is retiring now after fifty-one years of public appearance  --  still pleasing and stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seventy-nine , Lilli Lehmann , in memory still a part of musical New York . What giantesses , what admirable examples of great womanhood on the stage , what fountains of energy and power ! What proof that to artistic supereminence may be coupled simplicity , sweetness , modesty , selflessness , the ardent desire to pass on one 's art to others , and a deep sense of public responsibility in return for wonderful gifts of nature .
