SCENE  --  A small , barren coral island on the southern fringe of the Malay Archipelago . The coral sand , blazing white under the full glare of the sun , lifts in the right foreground to a long hummock a few feet above sea-level . A stunted coco palm rises from the center of this elevation , its bunch of scraggly leaves drooping motionlessly , casting a small circular patch of shadow directly beneath on the ground about the trunk . About a hundred yards in the distance the lagoon is seen , its vivid blue contrasting with the white coral beach which borders its circular outline . The far horizon to seaward is marked by a broad band of purplish haze which separates the bright blue of the water from the metallic gray-blue of the sky . The island bakes . The intensity of the sun 's rays is flung back skyward in a quivering mist of heat-waves which distorts the outlines of things , giving the visible world an intangible eerie quality , as if it were floating submerged in some colorless molten fluid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curled up in the patch of shade beneath the coco palm . He is a runty , undersized boy of fifteen , with a shrivelled old face , tanned to parchment by the sun . He has on a suit of dirty dungarees , man 's size , much too large for him , which hang in loose folds from his puny frame . A thatch of brown hair straggles in limp wisps from under the peaked canvas cap he wears . He looks terribly exhausted . His dreams are evidently fraught with terror , for he twitches convulsively and moans with fright . Butler enters hurriedly , panting , from the right , rear . He is a tall man of over middle age , dressed in the faded remainder of what was once a brown suit . The coat , the buttons of which have been torn off , hangs open , revealing his nakedness beneath . A cloth cap covers his bald head , with its halo of dirty thin gray hair . His body is emaciated . His face , with its round , blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wreck of a pair of heavy shoes flop about his bare feet . He looks back cautiously , as if he were afraid of being followed ; then satisfied that he is not , he approaches the sleeping boy , and bending down , puts his hand on Abel 's forehead . Abel groans and opens his eyes . He stares about furtively , as if seeking someone whose presence he dreads to find . ABEL ( in a husky voice ) Where 's Capt'n and the rest , Butts ? p. 3 BUTLER ( in a boarse , cracked whisper ) On the beachdown there . ( He makes an exhausted gesture , right , and then sinks with a groan at the foot of the tree , leaning back against the trunk , trying vainly to hunch his long legs up so as to be completely in the shade . ) ABEL ( with avid eyes ) They ai n't found no water yet ? BUTLER ( shaking his head , his eyes closing wearily ) No . How would they  --  when there ai n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bone , my sonny  --  sand and sun  --  that 's all . ABEL ( with a sudden , shrill agony  --  his lips twitching ) I need a drink of water  --  something awful ! ( with tremulous pleading ) Say , ai n't you got ' nother drink left ?  --  honest , ai n't you ? BUTLER ( looking around him cautiously ) Not so loud ! ( fixing his eyes sternly on the boy ) This is a dead secret , mind ! You 'll swear you wo n't blab  --  not to him ? ABEL Sure , Butts , sure ! Gawd strike me dead ! BUTLER ( takes a pint bottle from the hip-pocket of his pants . It is about half full of water . ) He  --  and the rest  --  they 'd kill me like a dog  --  and you too , sonny  --  remember that ! p. 4 ABEL Sure ! I ai n't goin ' to tell ' em , Butts . ( stretching out his hands frenziedly ) Aw , give it to me , Butts ! Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you do n't ! Only a few drops . It 's got to last ' til a ship comes past that 'll pick us up . That 's the only hope . ( holding the bottle at arm 's length from the boy ) Hands down , now  --  or you do n't get a drop ! ( The boy lets his hands drop to his sides . Butler puts the bottle carefully to his lips , and allows the boy two gulps  --  then snatches it away . ) That 's all now . More later . ( He takes one gulp himself , and making a tremendous effort of will , jerks the bottle from his lips , and corking it quickly , thrusts it back in his pocket and heaves a shuddering sigh . ) ABEL Aw , more ! Just another swaller  --  BUTLER ( determinedly ) No ! ABEL ( crying weakly ) Yuh dirty mutt ! BUTLER ( quietly ) Do n't get riled . It only makes you hotter  --  and thirstier . ( The boy sinks back exhausted and closes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , as if the sip of water had renewed his courage . ) That 'll save us yet , that bit of water . A lucky notion of mine to think of it  --  at the last moment . They were just lowering the boats . I could hear you calling to me to hurry and come . But I thought of filling this bottle . It 'd been lying there in the galley for two years almost . I 'd had it on my hip , full of whisky , that night in Oakland when I was shanghied . So I filled it out of a bucket before I ran to the boat . Lucky I did , son  --  for you and me  --  not for them  --  damn ' em ! ( as if in self-justification ) Why should I tell ' em , eh ? Did I ever get anything better than a kick or a curse from one of them ? ( vindictively ) Would they give it to me if they had it ? They 'd see me in hell first ! And besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad as hatters right now , the four of them . They ai n't had a drop since three nights back , when the water in the cask gave out and we rowed up against this island in the dark . ( Suddenly he laughs queerly . ) Did n't you hear them shouting and yelling like lunatics just before I came ? p. 5 ABEL I thought I heard something  --  on'y maybe I was dreamin ' . BUTLER It 's them that are doing the dreaming . I was with them . ( with rising anger ) He kicked me awake  --  and every time I tried to get away he beat me back . He 's strong yet  --  ( with threatening vindictiveness )  --  but he ca n't last long , damn him ! ( controlling himself , goes on with his story excitedly ) We went looking for water . Then Jimmy Kanaka saw a boat sunk half under down inside the reef  --  a Malay canoe , only bigger . They thought there might be something to drink on her . All of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a box they 'd forced open , yelling and cursing and out of their heads completely . When I looked I seen the box was full of all sorts of metal junk  --  bracelets and bands and necklaces that I guess the Malays wear . Nothing but brass and copper , and bum imitations of diamonds and things  --  not worth a damn ! I picked up some of the stuff to make sure . Then I told him straight . " This ai n't gold . It 's brass and copper  --  not worth a damn . " God , he got wild ! I had to run , or he 'd knifed me. ( with sudden violence ) It serves ' em right , all that 's happened and going to happen . Me shanghied when I was drunk  --  taken away from a good job and forced to cook the swill on a rotten whaler ! Oh , I 'll pay him back for it ! His damn ship is wrecked and lost to him  --  that 's the first of it . I 'll see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you and me 'll be saved ! D' you know why I 've let you go halves on this water ? It 's because they kicked and beat you , too . And now we 'll get even ! ( He sinks back , exhausted by this outburst . They are both silent , leaning with closed eyes against the bole of the tree . A murmur of men 's voices comes from the right , rear , and gradually gets nearer. ) p. 6 ABEL ( opening his eyes with a start ) Butts ! I hear ' em comin ' ! BUTLER ( listening , wide-eyed , for a moment ) Yes , it 's them . ( He gets up weakly . Abel staggers to his feet . They both move to the left . Butler shades his eyes with his hands and looks toward the beach . ) Look ! They 're dragging along that box of junk with ' em , the damn fools ! ( warningly ) They 're crazy as hell . Do n't give ' em no chance to pick on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heavy footsteps in the sand , and Captain Bartlett appears , followed by Horne , who in turn is followed by Cates and Jimmy Kanaka . Bartlett is a tall , huge-framed figure of a man , dressed in a blue double-breasted coat , pants of the same material , and rubber sea-boots turned down from the knees . In spite of the ravages of hunger and thirst there is still a suggestion of immense strength in his heavy-muscled body . His head is massive , thickly covered with tangled , iron-gray hair . His face is large , bony , and leather-tanned , with a long aquiline nose and a gash of a mouth shadowed by a bristling gray mustache . His broad jaw sticks out at an angle of implacable stubbornness . Bushy gray brows overhang the obsessed glare of his somber dark eyes . Silas Horne is a thin , parrot-nosed , angular old man , his lean face marked by a life-time of crass lusts and mean cruelty . He is dressed in gray cotton trousers , and a singlet torn open across his hairy chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest has been blistered and seared by the sun . A cap is on his head . Cates is squat and broad chested , with thick , stumpy legs and arms . His square , stupid face , with its greedy pig 's eyes , is terribly pock-marked . He is gross and bestial , an unintelligent brute . He is dressed in dungaree pants and a dirty white sailor 's blouse , and wears a brown cap . Jimmy Kanaka is a tall , sinewy , bronzed young Islander . He wears only a loin cloth and a leather belt with a sheath-knife . The last two are staggering beneath the weight of a heavy inlaid chest . The eyes of the three white men are wild . They pant exhaustedly , their legs trembling with weakness beneath them . Their lips are puffed and cracked , their voices muffled by their swollen tongues . But there is a mad air of happiness , of excitement , about their scorched faces. ) p. 7 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( in a crooning , monotonous voice ) It 's heavy , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up with her ! ( He flings himself in the shade , resting his back against the tree , and points to the sand at his feet . ) Put ' er there , bullies  --  there where I kin see ! HORNE ( echoing his words mechanically ) Put ' er there ! CATES ( in thick , stupid tones ) Aye-aye , sir ! Down she goes , Jimmy . ( They set the chest down . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT Sit down , lads , sit down . Ye 've earned your spell of rest . ( The three men throw themselves on the sand in attitudes of spent weariness . Bartlett 's eyes are fixed gloatingly on the chest . There is a silence suddenly broken by Cates , who leaps to a kneeling position with a choked cry . ) CATES ( his eyes staring at the Captain with fierce insistence ) I want a drink  --  water ! ( The others are startled into a rigid , dazed attention . Horne 's lips move painfully in a soundless repetition of the word . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his fist , as if to drive this obsession from his brain . Butler and Abel stand looking at them with frightened eyes. ) p. 8 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( having regained control over himself , in a determined voice , deep-toned and menacing ) If ye speak that word again , Ben Cates  --  if ye say it once again  --  ye 'll be food for the sharks ! Ye hear ? CATES ( terrified ) Yes , sir . ( He collapses limply on the sand again . Horne and the Kanaka relax hopelessly . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with heavy scorn ) Are ye a child to take on like a sick woman  --  cryin ' for what ye know we 've not got ? Ca n't ye stand up under a little thirst like a man ? ( resolutely ) There 'll be water enough  --  if ye 'll wait and keep a stiff upper lip on ye . We 'll all be picked up today . I 'll stake my word on it . This state o ' things ca n't last . ( His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singin ' ' stead o ' cryin '  --  after the find we 've made . What 's the lack of water amount to  --  when ye 've gold before you ? ( with mad exultation ) Gold ! Enough of it is your share alone to buy ye rum , and wine , and women , too , for the rest o ' your life ! CATES ( straightening up to a sitting posture  --  his small eyes staring at the box fascinatedly  --  in a stupid mumble ) Aye  --  aye  --  rum and wine ! p. 9 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( half closing his eyes as if the better to enjoy his vision ) Aye , rum and wine and women for you and Horne and Jimmy . No more hard work on the dirty sea for ye , bullies , but a full pay-day in your pockets to spend each day o ' the year . ( The three strain their ears , listening eagerly . Even Butler and Abel advance a step or two toward him , as if they , too , were half hypnotized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be the proper one to complain  --  if complainin ' there was to do ! Ai n't I lost my ship and the work o ' two years with her ? And what have ye lost , all three , but a few rags o ' clothes ? ( with savage emphasis ) I tell ye , I be glad the Triton went down ! ( He taps the box with his fingers . ) They 's more in this than ever was earned by all the whalin ' ships afloat . They 's gold  --  heavy and solid  --  and diamonds and emeralds and rubies !  --  red and green , they be . CATES ( licking his lips ) Aye , I seen ' em there  --  and emeralds be green , I know , and sell for a ton of gold ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( as if he had n't heard and was dreaming out loud to himself ) Rum and wine for you three , and rest for me . Aye , I 'll rest to home ' til the day I die . Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nat and Sue , your father be comin ' home for the rest o ' his life ! I 'll give up whalin ' like ye 've always been askin ' me , Sarah . Aye , I 'll go to meetin ' with ye on a Sunday like ye 've always prayed I would . We 'll make the damn neighbors open their eyes , curse ' em ! Carriages and silks for ye  --  they 'll be nothin ' too good  --  and for Sue and the boy . I 've been dreamin ' o ' this for years . I never give a damn ' bout the oil  --  that 's just trade  --  but I always hoped on some voyage I 'd pick up ambergris  --  a whole lot of it  --  and that 's worth gold ! p. 10 HORNE ( his head bobbing up from his chest drowsily ) Aye , ambergris ! It 's costly truck . BUTLER ( in a whisper to the boy  --  cautiously ) There ! Was n't I right ? Mad as hatters , all of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a somnambulist ) It 's time I setted down to home with ye , Sarah . They 's plenty o ' big trees on my place , bullies , and shade and green grass , and a cool wind off the sea . ( He shakes off the growing drowsiness and glares about him in a rage . ) Hell 's fire ! What crazy truck be I thinkin ' of ? ( But he and the others sink back immediately into stupor . After a pause he begins to relate a tale in a droning voice . ) Years ago , when I was whalin ' out o ' New Bedford , a man come to me  --  Spanish-looking , he was  --  and wanted to charter my ship and me go shares . He showed me a map o ' some island off the coast of South America some-where . They was a cross marked on it where treasure had been buried by the old pirates . But I was a fool . I did n't believe him . He got old Scott 's schooner  --  finally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 've never forgot him and his map . And often I 've thought if I 'd ' a ' went that vige  --  ( He straightens up and shouts with aggressive violence ) But here she be ! Run right into it  --  without no map nor nothin ' . Gold and diamonds and all  --  there they be in front o ' our eyes ! ( to the now alert Jimmy ) Open ' er up , Jimmy ! p. 11 KANAKA ( getting up  --  in his soft voice ) Aye , Captain . ( He reaches down to lift the lid . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( A sudden change of feeling comes over him , and he knocks Jimmy 's arm aside savagely . ) Hands off , ye dog ! I 'm takin ' care o ' this chest , and no man 's hand 's goin ' to touch it but mine ! KANAKA ( stepping back docilely  --  in the same unmoved , soft tone ) Aye , Captain . ( He squats down to the left of the chest . ) CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time ) So there you be , eh ? ( his voice growing thick with rage ) I ai n't forgot what ye said down by the shore there ! Lucky for ye I did n't catch ye then ! " Brass and copper  --  junk , " ye said  --  " not gold ! Not worth a damn , " ye said ! Ye blasted son o ' a liar ! ( looking at Abel ) Ye 've been tellin ' that boy your lies too , I kin tell by the look o ' him . ( sternly ) Come here , boy ! ABEL ( advances with faltering steps ) Y-yes , s-sir ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT Open up that chest ! Open it up , ye brat ! ( With a desperate movement of fear Abel reaches down and flings open the lid of the chest . As he does so , Bartlett 's huge hand fastens on the collar of his coat , and holds him with face bent over the box . Horne , Cates , and Jimmy Kanaka pull themselves close , their necks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( shaking the terror-stricken boy ) What d'ye see there , ye little swab ? What d'ye see there ? ABEL Aw  --  leggo  --  I 'm chokin ' ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( grimly ) Ye 'll choke in earnest if ye do n't answer me . What d'ye see ? Is it gold ? Answer me  --  is it gold ? ABEL ( stutteringly ) Yes  --  sure  --  gold  --  I see it ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( thrusts him away . The boy staggers and falls to the sand . Bartlett turns to Butler triumphantly . ) Ye see , ye liar ? Gold ! Gold ! Even a child can tell it at a look . ( with a somber menace in his tone ) But ye  --  do n't believe  --  do ye ? BUTLER ( frightenedly ) Maybe I was wrong , sir . I  --  did n't  --  look very careful . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Come here ! ( He stands up , his back against the tree . ) Come here ! BUTLER Yes , sir . ( But he looks about him shiftily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( The Kanaka leaps to his feet . ) Knife him , Jimmy , if he tries to run . p. 13 KANAKA ( His hand goes to his knife , his dark eyes lighting up with savagery  --  in his soft voice ) Aye , Captain ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( to the trembling cook ) Come here ! BUTLER ( goes to him with the courage of desperation ) Yes , sir . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( pointing to the contents of the chest ) Is it gold  --  or no ? BUTLER If I can feel of one  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT Pick one up . BUTLER ( picks up a heavy anklet encrusted with colored glass , looks at it for a minute  --  then feigning great assurance ) I was wrong , Captain . It 's gold all right enough  --  worth all kinds of money , I bet . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with mad triumph ) Ha ! Ye 've come to your senses , have ye ? Too late , ye swab ! No share for ye ! And here 's to teach ye for lyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his side , and Butler is knocked sprawling on the sand , where he lies groaning for a moment , the anklet still clutched in his hand . The boy gives a gasp of fright and scampers off , left. ) p. 14 CAPTAIN BARTLETT That 'll learn ye ! ( He sits down beside the chest . The others crouch close . Bartlett shoves in both of his hands  --  in a tone of mad gloating ) Gold ! Better'n whaling , ai n't she , boys ? Better'n ambergris , even if I ever had luck to find any ! ( Butler staggers to his feet . He examines the anklet with contemptuous scorn and even bites it to make sure . Then he edges stealthily toward the left . A sudden transformation comes over his face and he glowers at the Captain with hatred , his features distorted with fury . ) KANAKA ( pointing to Butler ) He got him , Captain ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( glancing at the cook with contemptuous scorn ) Sneakin ' away with that piece o ' the gold , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough it 's gold now , do n't ye ? Well , ye kin keep it  --  for your share for speakin ' the truth that once . HORNE ( his cupidity protesting ) Do n't give it to him , sir ! It 's so much the less for us that worked for it when he did nothin ' ! BUTLER ( overcome by hysterical rage  --  stammering ) Who asked you for it  --  eh ? Who  --  wants the dam thing ? Not me ! No ! ( holding the anklet out contemptuously ) Gold ? Ha-ha ! Gold ? Brass , that 's what  --  and pieces of glass ! Junk ! Not worth a dam . Here ! Take it ! ( He flings it on the sand before them . Bartlett snatches it up protectingly. ) p. 15 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( in a frenzy ) Jimmy ! ( But Butler runs off left with a terrified cry . Jimmy springs to his feet and stands with his hand on his knife , waiting for a further order . ) KANAKA ( eagerly ) I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pausing  --  with a frown ) No . They 's time enough for that  --  if need be . Sit down ( Jimmy sits down again with a childish air of sulking . Bartlett stares at the treasure , continuing to frown , as if Butler 's action had made him uneasy , bewildered and confused him . He mutters half to himself ) Queer ! Queer ! He threw it back as if ' t was a chunk of mud ! He knew  --  and yet he said he did n't want it . Junk , he called it  --  and he knows it 's gold ! He said ' t was gold himself a second back . He 's queer . Why would he say junk when he knows it 's gold ? D'ye think  --  he do n't believe ? HORNE He was mad because you knocked him down . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( shaking his head grimly ) It ai n't the first time I 've knocked him down ; but he never spoke up to me  --  like that  --  before . No , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 16 HORNE No share for him , you told him , sir . That 's what 's wrong with him . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( again shaking his head ) No . His eyes  --  It 's somethin ' he 's got in his head  --  somethin ' he 's hidin ' ! His share  --  maybe he thinks he 'll get his share anyway , in spite o ' us ! Maybe he thinks his share would n't be all he wants ! Maybe he thinks we 'll die o ' hunger and thirst before we get picked up  --  and he 'll live  --  and then  --  he 'll come in for the whole chestful ! ( suddenly springing to his feet in a rage ) Hell 's fire ! That 's it , bullies ! That 's his sneakin ' plan ! To watch us die  --  and steal it from us ! CATES ( rising to his knees and shaking his hand threateningly above his head ) Tell Jimmy to knife him , sir ! Tell Jimmy  --  I ai n't got a knife , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . ) KANAKA ( eagerly ) You speak , I stick him , Captain . I stick boy , too . CATES ( weakening ) I 'm weak , but I kin do for him yet . I 'm weak  --  ( His knees sag under him . He pleads piteously ) If I 'd only a drink to put some strength in me ! If I 'd only a sup o ' water , I 'd do for him ! ( turning , as if to stagger down toward the beach ) There must be water . Let 's look again . I 'll go look  --  ( But the effort he makes is too much for his strength and he falls to the sand , panting with open mouth. ) p. 17 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( summoning his will  --  sternly ) Put a clapper on that jaw of yours , Cates , or I 'll do it for ye ! CATES ( blubbering ) If we do n't find water  --  he 'll watch us die . KANAKA ( insinuatingly ) Better me knife cook fella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' em give us drink , ye fools ? ( After a pause , he shakes his head as if to drive off some thought , and mutters ) No more o ' that ! ( suddenly , in a tone of sharp command ) No more o ' that , I say ! We 're keepin ' no right watch for ships . Go aloft on that tree , Jimmy  --  and damn quick ! ( Kanaka climbs quickly up the bole of the coco palm to the top and looks out on all sides of him . The others rise painfully to their feet and gaze up at him with awakened hope . ) KANAKA ( suddenly , in a glad voice ) I see um  --  see sail , Captain . CATES ( waving his arms frenziedly ) Sail  --  ho ! KANAKA Look plenty like trade schooner , Captain . She no change course she fetch plenty close by here . She make full sail , she got plenty fella wind out there , she come quick . p. 18 HORNE ( clapping Cates on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d' you hear ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT Come down . ( The Islander slides down . Bartlett exclaims exultantly ) Did n't I tell ye ? In the nick o ' time . When she makes in close we 'll go down to the reef and yell and wave at her . They 'll see ! The luck 's with us today ! ( His eyes fall on the treasure and he starts . ) But now  --  what 's to do with this chest  --  the gold ? HORNE ( quickly ) You ai n't going to tell them on the schooner about it ? CATES They 'd claim to share with us . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( scornfully ) D'ye think I 'm cracked ? No , we 'll bury it here . CATES ( regretfully ) Leave it behind for anyone to find ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT We 'll bury it deep , where hell itself wo n't find it  --  and we 'll make a map o ' this island . ( He takes a piece of paper and a stub of pencil from his pocket  --  pointing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Horne and Jimmy  --  and dig it deep . ( The two bend down and commence to hollow out the sand with their hands . Bartlett draws on the paper . ) There 's the lagoon  --  and the reef  --  ( to Cates , who is peering over his shoulder ) And here where the tree is , d'ye see , Cates , I 'll make a cross where the gold is hid . ( exultantly ) Oh , all hell 'd not stop me from findin ' this place again ! Let us once get home and I 'll fit out a small schooner the four of us can sail , and we 'll come back here to dig it up . It wo n't be long , I swear to ye ! p. 19 HORNE ( straightening up ) This deep enough , sir ? KANAKA ( who has straightened up and is looking off left  --  suddenly points excitedly ) He look , Captain ! Cook fella , he look here ! Boy he look , too ! They look plenty too much , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy , whose presence on the island they have forgotten in their mad excitement . ) CATES ( in stupid dismay ) They 'll know where it 's hid , sir ! HORNE They 'll tell ' em on the schooner ! CATES ( wildly ) We 've got to do for ' em , Captain ! Gim me your knife , Jimmy  --  your knife  --  ( He stumbles toward the Islander , who pushes him aside brusquely , looking questioningly toward the Captain . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( who has been standing motionless , as if stunned by this forgotten complication  --  slowly ) There they be watchin ' us , the sneakin ' dogs ! I was forgettin ' they was here . ( striking his knee with clenched fist ) We 've got to do somethin ' damn quick ! That schooner 'll be up soon where they kin sight her  --  and they 'll wave and yell then  --  and she 'll see ' em ! p. 20 HORNE And good-by to the gold for us ! KANAKA ( eagerly ) You say fella word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make plenty cry for schooner ! They keep dam still plenty too much ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( looking at the Islander with mad cunning but replying only to Horne ) Aye , it 's good-by to the gold , Horne . That scum of a cook  --  he 's made a mock o ' us  --  sayin ' it was n't gold when he knew it was  --  he 'll tell ' em  --  he 'll get joy o ' tellin ' ' em ! HORNE And that scrub of a boy  --  he 's no better . He 'll be in with him neck and crop . CATES ( hoarsely ) Knife ' em  --  and be done with it  --  I say ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT Or , if they do n't tell the schooner 's skipper it 'll only be because they 're plannin ' to come back themselves  --  before we kin  --  and dig it up . That cook  --  there 's somethin ' queer in his mind  --  somethin ' he was hidin '  --  pretendin ' not to believe . What d'ye think , Horne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and talkin ' wo n't do no good . ( insinuatingly ) They 'd do for us soon enough if they was able . p. 21 CAPTAIN BARTLETT Aye , murder was plain in his eyes when he looked at me . HORNE ( lowering his voice to a whisper ) Tell Jimmy  --  Captain Bartlett  --  is what I say ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT It 's agin the law , Silas Horne ! HORNE The law do n't reach to this island . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( monotonously ) It 's agin the law a captain 's sworn to keep wherever he sails . They ai n't refused duty  --  nor mutinied . HORNE Who 'll know they ai n't ? They 're trying to steal what 's yours  --  that 's worse'n mutiny . ( as a final persuasion ) And Jimmy 's a heathen and under no laws . And he 's stronger'n you are . You could n't stop ' im . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Aye  --  I could n't prevent  --  KANAKA ( eagerly ) I fix um , Captain , they no tell ! ( Bartlett does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes violent motions to Jimmy to go . The Islander stares at his master 's face . Then , seeming to read the direct command there , he grunts with satisfaction , and pulling his knife from its sheath , he goes stealthily off left . Cates raises himself on his haunches to watch the Islander 's movements . Horne and Bartlett sit still in a strained immobility , their eyes on the chest. ) p. 22 CATES ( in an excited whisper ) I see ' em ! They 're sittin ' with their backs this way ! ( a slight pause ) There 's Jimmy . He 's crawlin ' on his hands behind ' em . They do n't notice  --  he 's right behind  --  almost atop o ' them . ( A pause . Cates gives a fiendish grunt . ) Ugh ! ( Butler 's muffled cry comes from the left . ) Right in the middle of the back ! The cook 's done ! The boy 's runnin ' ! ( There is a succession of quick screams from the boy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body , and the boy 's dying groan . ) HORNE ( with satisfaction ) It 's done , sir ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( slowly ) I spoke no word , remember that , Silas Horne ! HORNE ( cunningly ) Nor me neither , sir . Jimmy took it on himself . If blame there is  --  it 's on him . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( gloomily ) I spoke no word ! ( Jimmy returns noiselessly from the left . ) KANAKA ( grinning with savage pride ) I fix um fella plenty , Captain . They no tell . They no open mouth plenty too much ! p. 23 CATES ( maudlinly ) You 're a man , Jimmy  --  a man with guts to him  --  even if you 're a  --  ( He babbles incoherently . ) KANAKA ( as the Captain does not look at him ) I go climb fella tree , Captain ? I make look for schooner ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( rousing himself with an effort ) Aye . ( The Islander climbs the tree . ) HORNE ( getting to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She come , Captain , she come plenty quick . HORNE ( looking in the direction Jimmy indicates ) I kin see her tops'ls from here , sir . Look ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( getting to his feet  --  stares out to sea ) Aye ! There she be  --  and makin ' towards us fast . ( In a flash his somber preoccupation is gone , and he is commander once more . He puts the anklet in his hand into his coat pocket  --  harshly ) Come down out o ' that ! They 's work to do . ( Jimmy clambers down . ) Did ye leave  --  them  --  lyin ' in plain sight on the open sand ? p. 24 KANAKA Yes . I no touch um , Captain . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Then ye 'll touch ' em now . Go , bury ' em , cover ' em up with sand . And mind ye make a good job o ' it that none 'll see . Jump now ! KANAKA ( obediently ) I go , Captain . ( He hurries off left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horne ! ( giving the prostrate Cates a kick ) Up out o ' that , Cates ! Go with Horne , and when ye see the schooner hull up , wave to ' em , and yell like mad , d'ye hear ? HORNE Aye , aye , sir ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT I 'll stay here and bury the gold . It 's best to be quick about it ! They may turn a spyglass on us when they raise the island from deck ! Off with ye ! ( He gives Cates another kick . ) CATES ( groaning ) I 'm sick ! ( incoherently ) Ca n't  --  report for duty  --  this watch . ( with a shout ) Water ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( contemptuously ) Ye dog ! Give him a hand , Horne . HORNE ( putting a hand under his shoulder ) Up , man ! We 're to signal the schooner . There 'll be water on board o ' her  --  barrels of it ! p. 25 CATES ( aroused , scrambles to his feet , violently shaking off Horne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring eyes catch the schooner 's sails on the horizon . He breaks into a staggering run and disappears down toward the beach , right rear , waving his arms wildly and shouting ) Ahoy ! Ahoy ! Water ! ( Horne walks out quickly after him . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( after a quick glance around , sinks on his knees beside the chest and shoves both hands into it . From the chest comes a metallic clink as he fingers the pieces in his hands gloatingly . ) Ye 're safe now ! ( in a dreaming tone , his eyes fixed before him in an ecstatic vision ) No more whalin ' on the dirty seas ! Rest to home ! Gold ! I 've been dreamin ' o ' it all my life ! ( shaking himself  --  savagely ) Ye fool ! Losin ' your senses , be ye ? Time ye was picked up ! Lucky ! ( He shoves down the lid and places the chest in the hole . He pushes the sand in on top of it , whispering hoarsely ) Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ye ! Aye  --  in spite of hell I 'll dig ye up again ! ( The voices of Horne and Jimmy can be heard from the distance shouting as The Curtain Falls ) @x SCENE  --  Interior of an old boat-shed on the wharf of the Bartlett place on the California coast . In the rear , a double doorway looking out over the end of the wharf to the bay with the open sea beyond . On the left , two windows , and another door , opening on the dock . Near this door , a cot with blankets and a pillow without a slip . In the center , front , a table with a bottle and glasses on it , and three cane-bottomed chairs . On the right , a fishing dory . Here and there about the shed all sorts of odds and ends pertaining to a ship  --  old anchors , ropes , tackle , paint-pots , old spars , etc . It is late afternoon of a day six months later . Sunlight filters feebly through the stained , cobwebby window panes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are discovered . Horne is in working clothes of paint-stained dungaree . If his sufferings on the island have left any marks on his dry wizened face , they are undiscoverable . In Bartlett , however , the evidence is marked . His hair has turned white . There are deep hollows under his cheek-bones . His jaw and tight-lipped mouth express defiant determination , as if he were fighting back some weakness inside himself , a weakness found in his eyes , which have something in them of fear , of a wishing to avoid other eyes . He is dressed much the same as when on the island . He sits by the table , center , his abstracted gaze bent on the floor before him . HORNE ( who is evidently waiting for the Captain to say something  --  after a pause , glancing at him uneasily ) I 'd best be gettin ' back aboard the schooner , sir . ( Receiving no answer he starts for the door on the left. ) p. 27 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( rousing himself with an effort ) Wait . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . They know we 'll be sailin ' then , do n't they  --  Cates and Jimmy ? HORNE Yes , sir . Oh , they 'll be glad o ' the word  --  and me , too , sir . ( with a greedy grin ) It 's all we 've been talkin ' of since ye brought us down here  --  diggin ' up the gold ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( passionately ) Aye , the gold ! We 'll have it before long , now , I reckon . That schooner  --  the way we 've fitted her up  --  she 'd take a man safe to the Pole and back ! We 'll drop anchor here with the chest on board in six months , unless  --  ( hesitates ) HORNE ( uneasily ) What , sir ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( brusquely ) The weather , ye fool ! HORNE We 'll trust to luck for that . ( glancing at the Captain curiously ) And speakin ' o ' luck , sir  --  the schooner ai n't been christened yet . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( betraying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 HORNE There 'd be no luck for a ship sailin ' out without a name . CAPTAIN BARTLETT She 'll have a name , I tell ye ! She 'll be named the Sarah Allen , and Sarah 'll christen her herself . HORNE It oughter been done , by rights , when we launched her a month back . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( sternly ) I know that as well as ye . ( after a pause ) She was n't willin ' to do it then . Women has queer notions  --  when they 're sick , like . ( defiantly  --  as if he were addressing someone outside of the room ) But Sarah 'll be willin ' now ! HORNE Yes , sir . ( He again turns to go , as if he were anxious to get away . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT Wait ! There 's somethin ' else I want to ask ye . Nat , he 's been hangin ' round the schooner all his spare time o ' late . ( with rising anger ) I hope ye 've remembered what I ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to him ! HORNE ( retreating a step  --  hastily ) No fear o ' that , sir ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT It ai n't that I 'm afeerd to tell him o ' the gold , Silas Horne . ( slowly ) It 's them  --  other things  --  I 'd keep him clear of . p. 29 HORNE ( immediately guessing what he means  --  reassuringly ) We was all out o ' our heads when them things happened , sir . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Mad ? Aye ! But I ai n't forgot  --  them two . ( He represses a shudder  --  then goes on slowly . ) Do they ever come back to you  --  when you 're asleep , I mean ? HORNE ( pretending mystification ) Who 's that , sir ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with somber emphasis ) That cook and that boy . They come to me . I 'm gettin ' to be afeered o ' goin ' to sleep  --  not ' feered o ' them , I do n't mean . ( with sudden defiant bravado ) Not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 've set my mind on . ( collecting himself ) But I 've waked up talkin ' out loud  --  and I 'm afeerd there might be someone hear me . HORNE ( uneasily  --  with an attempt to be reassuring ) You ai n't all cured o ' that sun and thirst on the island yet , sir . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( evidently reassured  --  with an attempt at conviviality ) Sit down a bit , Horne , and take a grog . ( Horne does so . Bartlett pours out a half-tumbler full of rum for himself and shoves the bottle over to Horne. ) p. 30 HORNE Luck to our vige , sir . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Aye , luck ! ( They drink . Bartlett leans over and taps Horne on the arm . ) Aye , it takes time to get cured o ' thirst and sun ! ( somberly  --  after a pause ) I spoke no word , Silas Horne , d'ye remember ? HORNE Nor me . Jimmy did it alone . ( craftily ) We 'd all three swear Bible oaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd given the word , there ai n't no good thinkin ' more o ' it , sir . Did n't they deserve all they got ? Was n't they plottin ' on the sly to steal the gold ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( his eyes gleaming ) Aye ! HORNE And when you said he 'd get no share of it , did n't he lie to your face that it was n't gold ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with sudden rage ) Aye , brass and junk , he said , the lyin ' scum ! That 's what he keeps sayin ' when I see him in sleep ! He did n't believe  --  an ' then he owned up him self ' t was gold ! He knew ! He lied a-purpose ! ( rising to his feet  --  with confident defiance ) They deserved no better nor they got . Let ' em rot ! ( pours out another drink for himself and Horne ) p. 31 HORNE Luck , sir ! ( They drink . There is a knock at the door on the left followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaiah ! " Bartlett starts but makes no answer . Horne turns to him questioningly . ) It 's Mrs. Bartlett , sir . Shall I open the door ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT No . I ai n't aimin ' to see her  --  yet awhile . ( then with sudden reasonless rage ) Let her in , damn ye ! ( Horne goes and unhooks the door . Mrs. Bartlett enters . She is a slight , slender little woman of fifty . Sickness , or the inroads of a premature old age , have bowed her shoulders , whitened her hair , and forced her to walk feebly with the aid of a cane . A resolute spirit still flashes from her eyes , however , and there is a look of fixed determination on her face . She stands gazing at her husband . There is something accusing in her stare . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( avoiding her eyes  --  brusquely ) Well ? What is it ye want o ' me , Sarah ? SARAH I want to speak with you alone , Isaiah . HORNE I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( in a tone almost of fear ) Wait . I 'm goin ' with ye . ( turning to his wife  --  with a certain rough tenderness ) Ye ought n't to walk down the hill here , Sarah . The doctor told ye to rest in the house and save your strength . p. 32 SARAH I want to speak to you alone , Isaiah . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( very uneasily ) I 've got to work on the schooner , Sarah . SARAH She 'll be sailin ' soon ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( suddenly turning on her defiantly ) Tomorrow at dawn ! SARAH ( with her eyes fixed accusingly on his ) And you be goin ' with her ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( in the same defiant tone ) Yes , I be ! Who else 'd captain her ? SARAH On a craft without a name . CAPTAIN BARTLETT She 'll have that name ! SARAH No . CAPTAIN BARTLETT She 'll have that name , I tell ye ! SARAH No . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( thoroughly aroused , his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He mutters menacingly ) Ye 'll see ! We 'll talk o ' that later , you and me . ( Without a further glance at his wife he strides past her and disappears through the doorway , followed by Horne . Mrs. Bartlett sinks down in the chair by the table . She appears suddenly weak and crushed . Then from outside comes a girl 's laughing voice . Mrs. Bartlett does not seem to hear , nor to notice Sue and Drew when they enter . Sue is a slender , pretty girl of about twenty , with large blue eyes , reddish-brown hair , and a healthy , sun-tanned , out-of-door complexion . In spite of the slightness of her figure there is a suggestion of great vitality and nervous strength about her . Drew is a well-set-up , tall young fellow of thirty . Not in any way handsome , his boyish face , tanned to a deep brown , possesses an engaging character of healthy , cheerful forcefulness that has its compelling charm . There would be no chance of mistaking him for anything but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , his walk , his voice , his whole bearing. ) p. 33 SUE ( as they enter ) He 'll either be here or on the schooner , Danny . ( Then she sees her mother , with startled amazement ) Ma ! Good heavens , what are you doing here ? Do n't you know you should n't  --  SARAH ( with a start  --  turning to her daughter with a forced smile ) There , Sue , now ! Do n't go scoldin ' me. ( then seeing Drew  --  in a tone of forced gayety ) And if there ai n't Danny Drew  --  back home to port at last ! You can kiss an old woman , Danny  --  without makin ' her jealous , I reckon . DREW ( kissing her  --  with a smile ) It certainly seems good to see you again  --  and be back again myself . SARAH We read in the paper where your ship 'd reached San Francisco . Sue 's been on pins and needles ever since . SUE ( protestingly ) Ma ! DREW ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be away from Sue  --  four months . You remember , Ma , I left just after the big excitement here  --  when Captain Bartlett turned up after we 'd all heard the Triton was wrecked and given him up for lost . SARAH ( her face clouding  --  in a tone of deep sorrow ) Yes . ( Drew is surprised and glances at Sue questioningly . She sighs . Mrs. Bartlett gets to her feet with difficulty , assisted by Drew. ) p. 34 SUE We 'll help you back to the house . SARAH Shucks ! I 'm sick o ' the house . I need sun and fresh air , and today 's so nice I could n't stay indoors . I 'm goin ' to set out on the wharf and watch your Pa workin ' on the schooner . Ai n't much time left to see her , Sue . They 're sailin ' tomorrow at dawn , your Pa says . SUE Tomorrow ? Then  --  you 're going to christen her ? SARAH ( with grim determination ) No , I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with puzzled curiosity , she immediately attempts to resume her joking tone . ) Shucks ! Here 's Danny wonderin ' what silliness we 're talkin of . It 's just this , Danny . Captain Bartlett , he 's got a crazy notion in his head that just because his ship was wrecked last vige he 'll give up whalin ' for life . He 's fitted out this little schooner for tradin in the Islands . More money in that , he says . But I do n't agree with no such lunatic notions , and I 'm not goin ' to set my approval on his craziness by christenin ' his ship with my name , like he wants me to . He 'd ought to stick to whalin ' , like he 's done all his life . Do n't you think so , Danny ? DREW ( embarrassed ) Why , sure  --  he 's rated one of the smartest whaling skippers here on the coast  --  and I should think  --  p. 35 SARAH Just what I tell him  --  only he 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still sunny and warm . It 's damp in here for an old body . ( Drew helps her to the door on the left , opens it , and the two go out , followed by Sue , who carries a chair . After a pause , Sue and Drew return . Sue carefully shuts the door after them . Her face is trouble ) DREW ( looks at her for a minute , then comes and puts his arm around her and kisses her ) What 's the trouble , Sue ? SUE ( trying to force a smile ) Nothing , Danny . DREW Oh , yes there is ! No use putting me off that way . Why , I 've felt it hanging about in the air ever since I looked at your Ma . SUE Yes , she 's failed terribly since you saw her last . DREW Oh , I do n't mean just sickness  --  only  --  did you notice how she had to  --  force herself  --  to joke about things ? She used to be so cheerful natural . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't what I mean , either . What is it , Sue ? Maybe I can help somehow . You look worried , too . Pshaw ! You can tell me , ca n't you ? SUE Why , yes , Danny  --  of course  --  only I 'm just as puzzled as you over what it comes from . It 's something between Pa and Ma  --  something only the two of them know . It all seemed to start one morning after you 'd left  --  about a week after he 'd come home with those three awful men . During that first week he acted all right  --  just like he used to  --  only he 'd get talking kind of wild now and then about being glad the Triton was lost , and promising we 'd all be millionaires once he started making trips on the schooner . Ma did n't seem to mind his going in for trading then . Then , the night of the day he bought the schooner , something must have happened between them . Neither of them came down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so sick we sent for the doctor . He said she 'd suffered a great shock of some kind , although she would n't tell him a word . I found Pa down in this shed . He 'd moved that cot down here , and said he 'd have to sleep here after that because he wanted to be near the schooner . It 's been that way ever since . He 's slept down here and never come up to the house except at mealtimes . He 's never been alone with Ma one second since then , I do n't believe . And she  --  she 's been trying to corner him , to get him alone . I 've noticed it , although she does her best to hide it from Nat and me . And she 's been failing , growing weaker and sicker looking every day . ( breaking down ) Oh , Danny , these last months have been terrible ! p. 36 DREW ( soothing her ) There ! It 'll all come out right . SUE I 'm sure that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound she 'll see him alone . DREW ( frowning ) Seems to me it must be all your Pa 's fault , Sue  --  whatever it is . Have you tried to talk to him ? SUE Yes  --  a good many times ; but all he 's ever said was : " There 's things you would n't take interest in , Sue . You 'll know when it 's time to know "  --  and then he 'd break off by asking me what I 'd like most to have in the world if he had piles of money . And then , one time , he seemed to be terribly afraid of something , and he said to me : " You hustle up and marry Danny , Sue . You marry him and get out of this . " DREW ( with an affectionate grin ) I surely wish you 'd take his advice , Sue ! ( He kisses her . ) SUE ( with intense longing ) Oh , I wish I could , Danny . DREW I 've quite considerable saved now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get my own ship , I 'm hoping , now that I 've got my master 's certificate . I was hoping at the end of this voyage  --  SUE So was I , Danny  --  but it ca n't be this time . With Ma so weak , and no one to take care of her but me  --  ( shaking her head  --  in a tone of decision ) I could n't leave home now , Danny . It would n't be right . I could n't feel really happy  --  until this thing  --  whatever it is  --  is settled between Pa and Ma and they 're just as they used to be again . ( pleadingly ) You understand , do n't you , Danny ? p. 37 DREW ( soberly ) Why  --  surely I do , Sue . ( He pats her hand . ) Only , it 's hard waiting . ( He sighs . ) SUE I know It 's just as hard for me . DREW I thought maybe I could help ; but this is n't anything anyone outside your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He goes on gloomily after a pause . ) What 's the matter with Nat ? Seems as if he ought to be able to step in and talk turkey to your Pa . SUE ( slowly ) You 'll find Nat changed , too , Danny  --  changed terribly . He 's caught the disease  --  whatever it is . You know how interested in his work he 's been ever since they put him in the designing department down in the shipyard ? DREW Yes . SUE ( with emphasis ) Well , all that 's changed . He hates it now , or at least he says he does . And when he comes home , he spends all his time prowling around the dock here , talking with those three awful men . And what do you think he told me only the other day ? That he was bound he 'd throw up his job and make this voyage on the schooner . He even asked me to ask Pa to let him go . DREW Your Pa do n't want him to , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave a fine position he worked so hard to get just for this crazy notion ! The terrible part is , he 's got Ma worried to death  --  as if she was n't upset enough already . She 's so afraid he 'll go  --  that Pa 'll let him at the last moment . DREW Maybe I can help after all . I can talk to Nat . SUE ( shaking her head ) He 's not the same Nat , Danny . DREW ( trying to be consoling ) Pshaw , Sue ! I think you just get to imagining things . ( As he finishes speaking , the door in the rear opens and Nat appears . He is a tall , loose-framed boy of eighteen , who bears a striking resemblance to his father . His face , like his father 's , is large and bony , with deepset black eyes , an aquiline nose , and a wide , thin-lipped mouth . There is no suggestion in Nat , however , of the older man 's physical health and great strength . He appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sallow complexion and stooped shoulders . His thick hair is a deep black . His voice recalls his father 's , hollow and penetrating . He is dressed in a gray flannel shirt and corduroy trousers . Drew calls out to him heartily ) Hello , Nat ! Speak of the Devil ! Sue and I were just talking about you . ( He goes toward Nat , his hand outstretched. ) p. 39 NAT ( comes toward them , meets Drew , and shakes his hand with evident pleasure ) Hello , Danny ! You 're a sight for sore eyes ! ( His manner undergoes a sudden change . He casts a quick , suspicious glance from Drew to his sister . ) You were talking about me ? What about ? SUE ( quickly  --  with a warning glance at Drew ) About your work down at the shipyard . NAT ( disgustedly ) Oh , that . ( in a tone of reasonless irritation ) For God 's sake , Sue , let me alone about my work . Do n't I have to live with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face the minute I get home ? I want to forget it  --  get away ! DREW Go to sea , eh ? NAT ( suspiciously ) Maybe . Why ? What do you mean ? ( turning to his sister  --  angrily ) What have you been telling Danny ? SUE I was talking about the schooner  --  telling him she sails tomorrow . NAT ( dumfounded ) Tomorrow ? ( overcome by sudden , nervous excitement ) It ca n't be . How do you know ? Who told you ? p. 40 SUE Ma . Pa told her . NAT Then she 's been talking to him  --  telling him not to take me , I 'll bet . ( angrily ) Oh , I wish Ma 'd mind her own business ! SUE Nat ! NAT Well , Sue , how would you like it ? I 'm not a little boy any more . I know what I want to do . I want to go with them . I want to go more than I 've ever wanted anything else in my life before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's afraid I  --  But I think I can force him to  --  ( He glances at Drew 's amazed face and stops abruptly  --  sullenly ) Where is Pa ? SUE He 's aboard the schooner . NAT ( disappointedly ) Then it 's no good trying to see him now . DREW Sound 's funny to hear you talking about going to sea . Why , you always used  --  NAT This is different . DREW You want to see the Islands , I suppose ? NAT ( suspiciously ) Maybe . Why not ? DREW What group is your Pa heading for first ? NAT ( more suspiciously ) You 'll have to ask him . Why do you want to know ? ( abruptly ) You better be getting up to the house , Sue  --  if we 're to have any supper . Danny must be hungry . ( He turns his back on them . They exchange meaning glances. ) p. 41 SUE ( with a sigh ) It must be getting late . Come on , Danny . You can see Pa later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Are n't you coming , Nat ? NAT No . I 'll wait . ( impatiently ) Go ahead . I 'll be up before long . DREW See you later , then , Nat . NAT Yes . ( They go out , rear . Nat paces up and down in a great state of excitement . The door on the left is opened and Bartlett enters . Father and son stand looking at one another for a second . Nat takes a step backward as if in fear , then straightens up defiantly . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( slowly ) Is this the way ye mind my orders , boy ? I 've told ye time an ' again not to be sneakin ' and spyin ' around this wharf . NAT I 'm not sneaking and spying . I wanted to talk to you , Pa . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( sits down by the table ) Well , here I be . NAT Sue said the schooner sails tomorrow . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Aye ! NAT ( resolutely ) I want to go with you , Pa. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter ) Ye ca n't . I 've told ye that before . Let this be the last time ye ask it . NAT But why ? Why ca n't I go ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ye 've your own work to do  --  good work . Attend to that and leave me to mine . NAT But you always wanted me to go on voyages to learn whaling with you . CAPTAIN BARTLETT This be different . NAT ( with excited indignation ) Yes , this is different ! Do n't I know it ? Do you think you can hide that from me ? It is different , and that 's why I want to go . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ye ca n't , I say . NAT ( pleadingly ) But why not , Pa ? I can do a man 's work on a ship , or anywhere else . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( roughly ) Your place is here , with Sue and your Ma , and here you 'll stay . NAT ( angrily ) That is n't any reason . But I know your real one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of uneasiness  --  forcing a scornful laugh ) Afeerd ! Afeerd o ' what ? Did ye ever know me to be afeerd ? p. 43 NAT Afraid of what I might find out if I went with you . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with the same forced , uneasy scorn ) And what d'ye think ye 'd find out , Nat ? NAT First of all that it 's not a trading venture you 're going on . Oh , I 'm not a fool ! That story is all right to fool the neighbors and girls like Sue . But I know better . CAPTAIN BARTLETT What d'ye know ? NAT You 're going for something else . CAPTAIN BARTLETT What would that be ? NAT I do n't know  --  exactly . Something  --  on that island . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( He gets to his feet with a forced burst of laughter . ) Ye fool of a boy ! Ye got that notion out o ' some fool book ye 've been reading , did n't ye ? And I thought ye 'd growed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn ) Ye 'll be tellin ' me next it 's buried treasure I be sailin ' after  --  pirates ' gold buried on that island  --  all in a chest  --  and a map to guide me with a cross marked on it where the gold is hid ! And then they be ghosts guardin ' it , be n't they  --  spirits o ' murdered men ? They always be , in the books . ( He laughs scornfully. ) p. 44 NAT ( gazing at him with fascinated eyes ) No , not that last . That 's silly  --  but I did think you might have found  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( laughing again ) Treasure ? Gold ? ( with forced sternness ) Nat , I be ashamed of ye . Ye 've had schoolin ' , and ye 've been doin ' a man 's work in the world , and doin ' it well , and I 'd hoped ye 'd take my place here to home when I be away , and look after your Ma and Sue . But ye 've owned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ britches , dreamin ' o ' pirates ' gold that never was ' cept in books . NAT But you  --  you 're to blame . When you first came home you did nothing but talk mysteriously of how rich we 'd all be when the schooner got back . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( roughly ) But what 's that to do with silly dreams ? It 's in the line o ' trade I meant . NAT But why be so mysterious about trade ? There 's something you 're hiding . You ca n't say no because I feel it . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( insinuatingly  --  with a crafty glance at his son ) Supposin ' in one of them Eastern trading ports I 'd run across a bit o ' business with a chance for a fortune in it for a man that was n't afeerd of the law , and could keep his mouth shut ? p. 45 NAT ( disappointed ) You mean illegal trading ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT I mean what I mean , Nat  --  and I 'd be a fool to tell an overgrown boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , for the matter o ' that  --  what I do mean . NAT ( turning toward the door in the rear  --  disgustedly ) If it 's only that , I do n't want to hear it . ( He walks toward the door  --  stops and turns again to his father . ) No , I do n't believe it . That 's not like you . You 're not telling the truth , Pa . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( rising to his feet  --  with a savage sternness in which there is a wild note of entreaty ) I 've listened to your fool 's talk enough . Get up to the house where ye belong ! I 'll stand no more o ' your meddling in business o ' mine . I 've been patient with ye , but there 's an end to that ! Take heed o ' what I 'm sayin ' , if ye know what 's good for ye ! ( with a sort of somber pride ) I 'll stand alone in this business and finish it out alone if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAT ( alarmed by this outburst  --  submissively ) Yes , Pa . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Then see that ye heed . ( after a pause  --  as Nat lingers ) They 'll be waitin ' for ye at the house . p. 46 NAT All right . I 'll go . ( He turns to the doorway on the left , but before he gets to it , the door is pushed open and Mrs. Bartlett enters . Nat stops , startled . ) Ma ! SARAH ( with a forced smile ) Run along , Nat . It 's all right . I want to speak with your Pa . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( uneasily ) Ye 'd best go up with Nat , Sarah . I 've work to do . SARAH ( fixing her eyes on her husband ) I want to talk with you alone , Isaiah . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( grimly  --  as if he were accepting a challenge ) As ye like , then . SARAH ( dismissing Nat with a feeble attempt at a smile ) Tell Sue I 'll be comin ' up directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking from one to the other uneasily ) All right , Ma . ( He goes out . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( waits for Nat to get out of hearing ) Wo n't ye set , Sarah ? ( She comes forward and sits by the table . He sits by the other side. ) p. 47 SARAH ( shuddering as she sees the bottle on the table ) Will drinkin ' this poison make you forget , Isaiah ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( gruffly ) I 've naught to forget  --  leastways naught that 's in your mind . But they 's things about the stubborn will o ' woman I 'd like to forget . ( They look at each other across the table . There is a pause . Finally he can not stand her accusing glance . He looks away , gets to his feet , walks about , then sits down again , his face set determinedly  --  with a grim smile ) Well , here we be , Sarah  --  alone together for the first time since  --  SARAH ( quickly ) Since that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard ) Since I come back to you , almost . Did ye ever stop to think o ' how strange it be we 'd ever come to this ? I never dreamed a day 'd come when ye 'd force me to sleep away from ye , alone in a shed like a mangy dog ! SARAH ( gently ) I did n't drive you away , Isaiah . You came o ' your own will . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Because o ' your naggin ' tongue , woman  --  and the wrong ye thought o ' me . SARAH ( shaking her head , slowly ) It was n't me you ran from , Isaiah . You ran away from your own self  --  the conscience God put in you that you think you can fool with lies . p. 48 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( starting to his feet  --  angrily ) Lies ? SARAH It 's the truth , Isaiah , only you be too weak to face it . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with defiant bravado ) Ye 'll find I be strong enough to face anything , true or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think evil o ' me , Sarah ? It 's mad o ' ye to hold me to account for things I said in my sleep  --  for the damned nightmares that set me talkin ' wild when I 'd just come home and my head was still cracked with the thirst and the sun I 'd borne on that island . Is that right , woman , to be blamin ' me for mad dreams ? SARAH You confessed the rest of what you said was true  --  of the gold you 'd found and buried there . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with a sudden fierce exultation ) Aye  --  that be true as Bible , Sarah . When I 've sailed back in the schooner , ye 'll see for yourself . There be a big chest o ' it , yellow and heavy , and fixed up with diamonds , emeralds and sech , that be worth more , even , nor the gold . We 'll be rich , Sarah  --  rich like I 've always dreamed we 'd be ! There 'll be silks and carriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ye 've a mind to want  --  and all that Nat and Sue 'll want , too . p. 49 SARAH ( with a shudder ) Are you tryin ' to bribe me , Isaiah  --  with a treasure that 's cursed by God ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( as if he had n't heard ) D'ye remember long ago , how I 'd talk to ye o ' findin ' ambergris , a pile o ' it on one vige that 'd make us rich ? Ye used to take interest then , and all the vige with me ye 'd be hopin ' I 'd find it , too . SARAH That was my sin o ' greed that I 'm bein ' punished for now . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( again as if he had n't heard ) And now when the gold 's come to us at last  --  bigger nor I ever dreamed on  --  ye drive me away from ye and say it 's cursed . SARAH ( inexorably ) Cursed with the blood o ' the man and boy ye murdered ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spoke no word ! SARAH That 's what you kept repeatin ' in your sleep , night after night that first week you was home , till I knew the truth , and could bear no more . " I spoke no word ! " you kept sayin ' , as if ' t was your own soul had you at the bar of judgment . And " That cook , he did n't believe ' t was gold , " you 'd say , and curse him . p. 50 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( wildly ) He was lyin ' , the thief ! Lyin ' so 's he and the boy could steal th ' gold . I made him own up he was lyin ' . What if it 's all true , what ye heard ? Had n't we the right to do away with two thieves ? And we was all mad with thirst and sun . Can ye hold madmen to account for the things they do ? SARAH You was n't so crazed but you remember . CAPTAIN BARTLETT I remember I spoke no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARAH But you could have prevented it with a word , could n't you , Isaiah ? That heathen savage lives in the fear of you . He 'd not have done it if  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( gloomily ) That 's woman 's talk . There be three o ' us can swear in any court I spoke no word . SARAH What are courts ? Can you swear it to yourself ? You ca n't , and it 's that 's drivin ' you mad , Isaiah . Oh , I 'd never have believed it of you for all you said in sleep , if it was n't for the way you looked and acted out of sleep . I watched you that first week , Isaiah , till the fear of it had me down sick . I had to watch you , you was so strange and fearful to me . At first I kept sayin ' , ' t was only you was n't rid o ' the thirst and the sun yet . But then , all to once , God gave me sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face , on the queer stricken way you acted , and guilt in your eyes . ( She stares into them . ) I see it now , as I always see it when you look at me . ( She covers her face with her hands with a sob ) p. 51 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( his face haggard and drawn  --  hopelessly , as if he were too beaten to oppose her further  --  in a hoarse whisper ) What would ye have me do , Sarah ? SARAH ( taking her hands from her face  --  her eyes lighting up with religious fervor ) Confess your sin , Isaiah ! Confess to God and men , and make your peace and take your punishment . Forget that gold that 's cursed and the voyage you be settin ' out on , and make your peace . ( passionately ) I ask you to do this for my sake and the children 's , and your own most of all ! I 'll get down on my knees , Isaiah , and pray you to do it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Confess and wash your soul of the stain o ' blood that 's on it . I ask you that , Isaiah  --  and God asks you  --  to make your peace with Him . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( his face tortured by the inward struggle  --  as if the word strangled him ) Confess and let someone steal the gold ! ( This thought destroys her influence over him in a second . His obsession regains possession of him instantly , filling him with rebellious strength . He laughs harshly . ) Ye 'd make an old woman o ' me , would ye , Sarah ?  --  an old , Sunday go-to-meetin ' woman snivelin ' and prayin ' to God for pardon ? Pardon for what ? Because two sneakin ' thieves are dead and done for ? I spoke no word , I tell ye  --  but if I had , I 'd not repent it . What I 've done I 've done , and I 've never asked pardon o ' God or men for ought I 've done , and never will . Confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my life that I 've found at last ! By thunder , ye must think I 'm crazed ! p. 52 SARAH ( seeming to shrivel up on her chair as she sees she has lost  --  weakly ) You be lost , Isaiah  --  and no one can stop you . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( triumphantly ) Aye , none 'll stop me . I 'll go my course alone . I 'm glad ye see that , Sarah . SARAH ( feebly trying to get to her feet ) I 'll go to home . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ye 'll stay , Sarah . Ye 've had your say , and I 've listened to ye ; now I 'll have mine and ye listen to me . ( Mrs. Bartlett sinks back in her chair exhaustedly . Bartlett continues slowly . ) The schooner sails at dawn on the full tide . I ask ye again and for the last time , will ye christen her with your name afore she sails ? SARAH ( firmly ) No . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( menacingly ) Take heed , Sarah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your husband ye 've sworn to obey . By right I kin order ye , not ask . SARAH I 've never refused in anything that 's right  --  but this be wicked wrong . CAPTAIN BARTLETT It 's only your stubborn woman 's spite makes ye refuse . Ye 've christened every ship I 've ever been skipper on , and it 's brought me luck o ' a kind , though not the luck I wanted . And ye 'll christen this one with your own name to bring me the luck I 've always been seekin ' . p. 53 SARAH ( resolutely ) I wo n't , Isaiah . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ye will , Sarah , for I 'll make ye . Ye force me to it . SARAH ( again trying to get up ) Is this the way you talk to me who 've been a good wife to you for more than thirty years ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( commandingly ) Wait ! ( threateningly ) If ye do n't christen her afore she sails , I 'll take Nat on the vige along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stunned . ) He wants to go , ye know it . He 's asked me a hundred times . He s'spects  --  ' bout the gold  --  but he do n't know for sartin . But I 'll tell him the truth o ' it , and he 'll come with me , unless  --  SARAH ( looking at him with terror-stricken eyes  --  imploringly ) You wo n't do that , Isaiah ? You wo n't take Nat away from me and drag him into sin ? I know he 'll go if you give him the word , in spite of what I say . ( pitifully ) You be only frightenin ' me ! You ca n't be so wicked cruel as that . CAPTAIN BARTLETT I 'll do it , I take my oath  --  unless  --  SARAH ( with hysterical anger ) Then I 'll tell him myself  --  of the murders you did , and  --  p. 54 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( grimly ) And I 'll say ' t was done in fair fight to keep them from stealin ' the gold ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'll believe me , not you . He 's his father 's son , and he 's set to go . Ye know it , Sarah . ( She falls back in the chair hopelessly staring at him with horrified eyes . He turns away and adds after a pause ) So ye 'll christen the Sarah Allen in the mornin ' afore she sails , wo n't ye , Sarah ? SARAH ( in a terrified tone ) Yes  --  if it 's needful to save Nat  --  and God 'll forgive me when He sees my reason . But you  --  Oh , Isaiah ! ( She shudders and then breaks down , sobbing . ) SARAH ( after a pause , turns to her humbly as if asking forgiveness ) Ye must n't think hard o ' me that I want your name . It 's because it 's a good woman 's name , and I know it 'll bring luck to our vige . I 'd find it hard to sail without it  --  the way things be . SARAH ( getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) I 'm goin ' to home . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( going to her ) I 'll help ye to the top o ' the hill , Sarah . SARAH ( shrinking from him in terror ) No . Do n't you touch me ! Do n't you touch me ! ( She hobbles quickly out of the door in the rear , looking back frightenedly over her shoulder to see if he is following asThe Curtain Falls ) @x SCENE  --  Dawn of the following morning  --  exterior of the Bartlett home , showing the main entrance , facing left , toward the harbor . On either side of the door , two large windows , their heavy green shutters tightly closed . In front of the door , a small porch , the roof supported by four white columns . A flight of three steps goes up to this porch from the ground . Two paths lead to the steps through the straggly patches of grass , one around the corner of the house to the rear , the other straight to the left to the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fenced in by a rail . The top of a steel ladder can be seen . This ladder leads up the side of the cliff from the shore below to the platform . The edge of the cliff extends from the left corner front , half-diagonally back to the right , rear-center . In the gray half-light of the dawn , Horne , Cates , and Jimmy Kanaka are discovered . Horne is standing on the steel platform looking down at the shore below . Cates is sprawled on the ground nearby . Jimmy squats on his haunches , his eyes staring out to sea as if he were trying to pierce the distance to the warm islands of his birth . Cates wears dungarees , Jimmy dungaree pants and a black jersey , Horne the same as in Act Two . CATES ( with sluggish indifference ) Ai n't she finished with it yet ? p. 57 HORNE ( irritably ) No , damn her ! I kin see ' em all together on the wharf at the bow o ' the schooner . CATES ( after a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to come up here and wait till it 's all done . HORNE There 's nothin ' funny to me that he does no more . He 's still out o ' his head , d'ye know that , Cates ? CATES ( stupidly ) I ai n't noticed nothin ' diff'rent ' bout him . HORNE ( scornfully ) He axed me if I ever seen them two in my sleep  --  that cook and the boy o ' the Triton . Said he did often . CATES ( immediately protesting uneasily as if he had been accused ) They was with us in the boat b'fore we fetched the island , that 's all ' bout ' em I remember . I was crazy , after . HORNE ( looking at him with contempt ) I 'll not call ye a liar , Cates , but  --  a hell o ' a man ye be ! You was n't so out o ' your head that ye forgot the gold , was ye ? CATES ( his eyes glistening ) Any man 'd remember that , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Aye . That 's the one thing I see in my sleep . ( There is the faint sound of cries from the beach below . Horne starts and turns to look down again . ) They must ' a ' finished it . ( Cates and Jimmy come to the edge to look down. ) p. 58 KANAKA ( suddenly  --  with an eager childish curiosity ) That falla wife Captain she make strong falla spell on ship , we sail fast , plenty good wind ? HORNE ( contemptuously ) Aye , that 's as near as ye 'll come to it . She 's makin ' a spell . Ye stay here , Jimmy , and tell us when the Old Man is comin ' . ( Jimmy remains looking down . Horne motions Cates to follow him , front  --  then in a low voice , disgustedly ) Did ye hear that damn fool nigger ? CATES ( grumblingly ) Why the hell is the Old Man givin ' him a full share ? One piece o ' it 'd be enough for a nigger like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid o ' him  --  if it comes to that . He knifed them two , ye remember . CATES Aye . HORNE The two o ' us can take oath to that . CATES Aye . HORNE ( after a calculating look into his companion 's greedy eyes  --  meaningly ) We 're two sane men , Cates  --  and the other two to share is a lunatic and a nigger . The skipper 's showed me where there 's a copy o ' his map o ' the island locked up in the cabin  --  in case anything happens to him I 'm to bring back the gold to his woman , he says . ( He laughs harshly . ) Catch me ! The fool ! I 'll be open with ye , Cates . If I could navigate and find the island myself I would n't wait for a cracked man to take me there . No , be damned if I would ! Me and you 'd chance it alone some way or other . p. 59 CATES ( greedily ) The two o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his head warningly ) But he 's a hard man to git the best on . HORNE ( grimly ) And I be a hard man , too . KANAKA ( turning to them ) Captain , he come . ( Cates and Horne separate hastily . Bartlett climbs into sight up the ladder to the platform . He is breathing heavily but his expression is one of triumphant exultation . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( motions with his arms ) Down with ye and git aboard . The schooner 's got a name now  --  a name that 'll bring us luck . We 'll sail on this tide . HORNE Aye  --  aye , sir . CAPTAIN BARTLETT I got to wait here till they climb up the path . I 'll be aboard afore long . See that ye have her ready to cast off by then . HORNE Aye  --  aye , sir . ( He and Cates disappear down the ladder . Jimmy lingers , looking sidewise at his Captain . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( noticing him  --  gruffly ) What are ye waitin ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife belong you , Captain , she make strong falla spell for wind blow plenty ? She catch strong devil charm for schooner , Captain ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( scowling ) What 's that , ye brown devil ? ( then suddenly laughing harshly ) Yes  --  a strong spell to bring us luck . ( roughly ) Git aboard , ye dog ! Do n't let her find ye here with me . ( Jimmy disappears hurriedly down the ladder . Bartlett remains at the edge looking down after him . There is a sound of voices from the right and presently Mrs. Bartlett , Sue , Drew and Nat enter , coming around the house from the rear . Nat and Drew walk at either side of Mrs. Bartlett , who is in a state of complete collapse , so that they are practically carrying her . Sue follows , her handkerchief to her eyes . Nat keeps his eyes on the ground , his expression fixed and gloomy . Drew casts a glance of angry indignation at the Captain , who , after one indifferent look at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner below . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( as they reach the steps of the house  --  intent on the work below  --  makes a megaphone of his hands and shouts in stentorian tones ) Look lively there , Horne ! p. 61 SUE ( protestingly ) Pa ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( wheels about . When he meets his daughter 's eyes he controls his angry impatience and speaks gently . ) What d'ye want , Sue ? SUE ( pointing to her mother who is being assisted through the door  --  her voice trembling ) You must n't shout . She 's very sick . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( dully , as if he did n't understand ) Sick ? SUE ( turning to the door ) Wait . I 'll be right back . ( She enters the house . As soon as she is gone all of Bartlett 's excitement returns . He paces up and down with nervous impatience . Nat comes out of the house . ) NAT ( in a tone of anxiety ) Ma seems bad . I 'm going for the doctor . CAPTAIN BARTLETT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attention to the schooner ) Smart lines on that schooner , boy . She 'll sail hell bent in a breeze . I knowed what I was about when I bought her . NAT ( staring down fascinatedly ) How long will the voyage take ? p. 62 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( preoccupied ) How long ? NAT ( insinuatingly ) To get to the island . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Three months at most  --  with fair luck . ( exultantly ) And I 'll have luck now ! NAT Then in six months you may be back  --  with it ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT Aye , with  --  ( stopping abruptly , turns and stares into his son 's eyes  --  angrily ) With what ? What boy 's foolishness be ye talkin ' ? NAT ( pleading fiercely ) I want to go , Pa ! There 's no good in my staying here any more . I ca n't think of anything but  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( sternly , to conceal his uneasiness ) Keep clear o ' this , boy , I 've warned ye ! SUE ( appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone for the doctor yet ? NAT ( shamefacedly ) I forgot . SUE Forgot ! NAT ( starting off ) I 'm going , Sue . ( then over his shoulder ) You wo n't sail before I come back , Pa . ( Bartlett does not answer . Nat stands miserably hesitating. ) p. 63 SUE Nat ! For heaven 's sake ! ( Nat hurries off around the corner of the house , rear . Sue comes to her father who is watching her with a queer , humble , hunted expression . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT Well , Sue ? SUE ( her voice trembling ) Oh , Pa , how could you drag Ma out of bed to christen your old boat  --  when you knew how sick she 's been ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( avoiding her eyes ) It 's only weakness . She 'll get well o ' it soon . SUE Pa ! How can you say things like that  --  as if you did n't care ! ( accusingly ) The way you 've acted ever since you 've been home almost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( wincing ) No ! SUE Oh , Pa , what is it that has come between you ? Ca n't you tell me ? Ca n't I help to set things right again ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( mumblingly ) Nothin '  --  nothin ' ye kin help  --  nor me . SUE But things ca n't go on like this . Do n't you see it 's killing Ma ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT She 'll forget her stubborn notions , now I be sailin ' away . p. 64 SUE But you 're not  --  not going for a while now , are you ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ai n't I been sayin ' I 'd sail at dawn today ? SUE ( looking at him for a moment with shocked amazement ) But you ca n't mean  --  right now ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( keeping his face averted ) Aye  --  or we 'll miss this tide . SUE ( putting her hands on his shoulders and trying to look into his face ) Pa ! You ca n't mean that ! ( His face is set with his obsessed determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You ca n't be as cruel as that ! Why , I thought , of course , you 'd put off  --  ( wildly ) You have , have n't you , Pa ? You did tell those men you could n't sail when you saw how sick Ma was , did n't you  --  when she fainted down on the wharf ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( implacably ) I said I was sailin ' by this tide ! SUE Pa ! ( then pleadingly ) When the doctor comes and you hear what he says  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( roughly ) I ai n't stoppin ' on his word nor any man's. ( intensely ) That schooner 's been fit to sail these two weeks past . I been waitin ' on her stubborn will ( he gestures toward the house ) , eatin ' my heart out day and night . Then I swore I 'd sail today . I tell ye , Sue , I got a feelin ' in my bones if I do n't put out now I never will . Aye , I feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe ) And when she christened the schooner  --  jest to the minute , mind ye !  --  a fair breeze sprung up and come down out o ' the land to blow her out to sea  --  like a sign o ' good luck . p. 65 SUE ( aroused to angry indignation ) Oh , I ca n't believe you 're the same man who used to be my father ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT Sue ! SUE To talk cold-bloodedly of sailing away on a long voyage when Ma 's inside  --  dying for all you seem to know or care ! You 're not the father I love ! You 've changed into someone else  --  hateful and cruel  --  and I hate him , I hate him ! ( She breaks down , sobbing hysterically . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( who has listened to her with a face suddenly stricken by fear and torturing remorse ) Sue ! Ye do n't know what ye be sayin ' , do ye ? SUE I do ! And I hate those three awful men who make you act this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were at the bottom of the sea ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( frenziedly  --  putting his hand over her mouth to stop her words ) Stop , girl ! Do n't ye dare  --  SUE ( shrinking away from him  --  frightenedly ) Pa ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( bewilderedly , pleading for forgiveness ) Do n't heed that , Sue  --  I did n't mean  --  ye git me so riled  --  I 'd not hurt ye for all the gold in the world . But do n't ye talk wrong o ' things ye ca n't know on . p. 66 SUE Oh , Pa , what kind of things must they be  --  when you 're ashamed to tell them ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ye 'll know all they be to know  --  and your Ma and Nat , too  --  when I come back from this vige . Oh , ye 'll be glad enough then  --  when ye see with your own eyes ! Ye 'll bless me then ' stead o ' turning agin me ! ( hesitating for a second  --  then somberly ) On'y now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd best keep clear o ' it . SUE ( passionately ) I do n't want to know anything about it . What I do know is that you ca n't sail now . Have n't you any heart at all ? Ca n't you see how bad Ma is ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT It 's the sight o ' me sickens her . SUE No . She called your name just a while ago  --  the only word she 's spoken since she christened the ship . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( desperately ) I got to git away from her , I tell ye , Sue ! She 's been houndin ' me ever since I got back  --  houndin ' me with her stubborn tongue till she 's druv me mad , a'most ! Ye 've been on'y givin ' thought to her , not me . It 's for her sake as much as my own I 'm goin '  --  for her and you and Nat . ( with a sudden reiurn of his old resolution ) I 've made up my mind , I tell ye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A hail in Horne 's voice comes thinly up from the shore below . Bartlett starts , his eyes gleaming . ) Ye hear ? It 's Horne hailin ' me to come . They be ready to cast off . I 'll git aboard . ( He starts for the ladder. ) p. 67 SUE Pa ! After all I 've said  --  without one word of goodby to Ma ! ( hysterically ) Oh , what can I do , what can I say to stop you ! She has n't spoken but that one call for you . She hardly seems to breathe . If it were n't for her eyes I 'd believe she was dead  --  but her eyes look for you . She 'll die if you go , Pa ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT No ! SUE You might just as well kill her now in cold blood as murder her that way ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( shaken  --  raising his hands as if to put them over his ears to shut out her words  --  hoarsely ) No ! Ye lie ! DREW ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anger  --  harshly ) Captain Bartlett ! ( then lowering his voice as he sees Sue ) Mrs. Bartlett is asking to see you , Captain , before you go . SUE There ! Did n't I tell you , Pa ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( struggling with himself  --  dully ) She 's wantin ' to hound me again , that be all . SUE ( seeing him weakening  --  grasps his hand persuasively ) Pa ! Come with me . She wo n't hound you . How silly you are ! Come ! ( Hesitatingly , head bowed , he follows her toward the door. ) p. 68 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( As he comes to Drew he stops and looks into the young man 's angry , accusing face . He mutters half mockingly ) So ye , too , be agin me , Danny ? DREW ( unable to restrain his indignation ) What man that 's a real man would n't be against you , sir ? SUE ( frightenedly ) Danny ! Pa ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( in a sudden rage draws back his fist threateningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with an effort and lets his arm fall to his side  --  scornfully ) Big words from a boy , Danny . I 'll forget them this time  --  on account o ' Sue . ( He turns to her . ) I 'm goin ' in to her to please ye , Sue  --  but if ye think any words that she kin say 'll change my mind , ye make a mistake  --  for I be sailin ' out as I planned I would in spite o ' all hell ! ( He walks resolutely into the house . Sue follows him after exchanging a hopeless glance with Danny . ) DREW ( to himself  --  with a shudder ) He 's mad , damn him ! ( He paces up and down . Horne appears on the ladder from below , followed by Cates. ) p. 69 HORNE ( coming forward and addressing Drew ) Is the skipper about ? DREW ( curtly ) He 's in the house . You ca n't speak to him now . HORNE She 's ready to cast off . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . ( as Drew makes no comment  --  impatiently ) If he do n't shake a leg , we 'll miss the tide . There 's a bit o ' fair breeze , too . DREW ( glancing at him resentfully ) Do n't count on his sailing today . It 's just as likely he 'll change his mind . HORNE ( angrily ) Change his mind again ? After us waitin ' and wastin ' time for weeks ! ( to Cates in a loud tone so Drew can hear ) What did I tell ye , Cates ? He 's crazy as hell . DREW ( sharply ) What 's that ? HORNE I was tellin ' Cates the skipper 's not right in his head . ( angrily ) What man in his senses 'd do the way he does ? DREW ( letting his resentment escape him ) That 's no lie , damn it ! HORNE ( surprised ) Aye , ye 've seen it , too , have ye ? ( after a pause ) Now I axe ye , as a sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a vige with a cracked man for skipper ? ( Sue comes out of the door , stops with a shudder of disgust as she sees the two sailors , and stands listening . They do not notice her presence. ) p. 70 DREW It seems to me a crazy voyage all round . ( with sudden interest as if a new idea had come to him ) But you know all about it , do n't you  --  what the Captain plans to do on this voyage  --  and all that ? HORNE ( dryly ) Aye , as well as himself  --  but I 'm tellin ' no man . DREW And I 'm not asking . What I want to find out is : Do you know enough about this business to make this one voyage alone and attend to everything  --  in case the Captain ca n't go ? HORNE ( exchanging a quick glance with Cates  --  trying to hide his eagerness ) Aye , I could do as well as any man alive . He could trust me for it  --  and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make with his head out o ' gear . ( then scowling ) On'y trouble is , who 'd captain her if he ai n't goin ' ? DREW ( disappointedly ) Then you do n't know navigation enough for that ? HORNE I 've never riz above bo'sun. ( then after a pause in which he appears to be calculating something  --  curiously ) Why d'ye ask me them questions ? ( insinuatingly  --  almost in a whisper ) It ca n't be done ' less we got an officer like you aboard . p. 71 DREW ( angrily ) Eh ? What 're you driving at ? SUE ( who has been listening with aroused interest ) Danny ! ( She comes down to him . Horne and Cates bob their heads respectfully and move back near the platform . Horne watches Sue and Drew out of the corner of his eye . ) Danny , I 've been listening to what you were saying , but I do n't understand . What are you thinking of ? DREW ( excitedly ) I was thinking  --  Listen , Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right mind . Something 's got to be done to keep him home in spite of himself . Even leaving your Ma out of it , he 's not in any fit state to take a ship to sea ; and I was thinking if we could fix it some way so that fellow Horne could take her out on this voyage  --  SUE But , Danny , Pa 'd never give in to that . DREW I was n't thinking he would . We  --  you 'd have to give the word  --  and keep him in the house somehow  --  and then when he did come out it 'd be too late . The schooner 'd be gone . SUE ( disturbed , but showing that this plan has caught her mind ) But  --  he 'd never forgive  --  DREW When he 's back in his right mind again , he would . ( earnestly ) You ca n't let him sail , and wreck his ship and himself in the bargain , likely . Then , there 's your Ma  --  p. 72 SUE No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at Horne and Cates ) But I do n't trust those men . DREW No more do I ; but it would be better to chance them than  --  ( suddenly interrupting himself  --  with a shrug of his shoulders ) But I was forgetting . None of them can navigate . SUE But did n't I hear him say  --  if they had an officer on board  --  like you  --  DREW Yes , but where 'll you find one at a second 's notice ? SUE ( meaningly ) And you told me , did n't you , that you 'd just got your master 's papers . DREW ( looking at her with stunned astonishment ) Sue ! D' you mean  --  SUE ( a light coming over her face ) Oh , Danny , we could trust you ! He 'd trust you ! And after he 'd calmed down I know he would n't mind so much . Oh , Danny , it 'll break my heart to have you go , to send you away just after you 've come back . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask  --  if it was n't for Ma being this way  --  and him  --  Oh , Danny , ca n't you see your way to do it  --  for my sake ? DREW ( bewilderedly ) Why , Sue , I  --  I never thought  --  ( then as he sees the look of disappointment which comes over her face at his hesitancy  --  resolutely ) Why sure , Sue , I 'll do it  --  if you want me to . I 'll do it if it can be done . But we 've got to hustle . You 've got to keep him in the house some way if he aims to come out . And I 'll talk to them . ( Sue goes to the doorway . Drew goes over to Horne and Cates. ) p. 73 SUE ( after listening ) He 's still in with Ma . It 's all right . DREW ( to Horne ) How would you like me for skipper on this one voyage ? Listen here . Miss Sue 's decided her father is n't in a fit state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CATES ( to Horne protestingly ) But if we git ketched the Old Man 'll take it out o ' our hides , not his'n . HORNE ( savagely  --  with a meaning look at Cates ) Shut up , ye fool ! DREW ( impatiently ) I 'll shoulder all that risk , man ! SUE ( earnestly ) No harm will come to any of you , I promise you . HORNE ( in the tone of one clinching a bargain ) Then we 'll chance it . ( warningly ) But it 's got to be done smart , sir . DREW I 've got to get my dunnage . I 'll be right back and we 'll tumble aboard . ( He goes into the house . Sue follows him in . ) CATES ( with stupid anger ) This is a hell o ' a mess we 're gettin ' in , if ye axe me. p. 74 HORNE And I tell ye it 's a great stroke o ' luck . CATES He 'll be aboard to spy on us . HORNE Leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git rid o ' him , I 'll find a means some way or other . CATES ( stupidly ) S'long as he do n't git no share o ' the gold  --  HORNE ( contemptuously ) Share , ye dumbhead ! I 'd see him in hell first  --  and send him there myself . ( Drew comes out of the house carrying his bag which he hands to Cates . Sue follows him . ) DREW Look lively now ! HORNE Aye  --  aye , sir . ( He and Cates clamber hurriedly down the ladder . ) SUE ( throwing her arms around his neck and kissing him ) Good-by , Danny . It 's so fine of you to do this for us ! I 'll never forget  --  DREW ( tenderly ) Ssssh ! It 's nothing , Sue . SUE ( tearfully ) Oh , Danny , I hope I 'm doing right ! I 'll miss you so dreadfully ! But you 'll come back just as soon as you can  --  p. 75 DREW Of course ! SUE Danny ! Danny ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you , do n't you ? ( kisses her ) And we 'll be married when I come back this time sure ? SUE Yes  --  yes  --  Danny  --  sure ! DREW I 've got to run . Good-by , Sue . SUE Good-by , dear . ( They kiss for the last time and he disappears down the ladder . She stands at the top , sobbing , following him with her eyes . Nat comes around the house from the rear and goes to the front door . ) NAT ( seeing his sister ) Sue ! He has n't gone yet , has he ? ( She does n't hear him . He hesitates in the doorway for a moment , listening for the sound of his father 's voice from inside . Then , very careful to make no noise , he tiptoes carefully into the house . Sue waves her hand to Drew who has evidently now got aboard the ship . Then she covers her face with her hands , sobbing . Nat comes out of the house again and goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dries her eyes hastily , trying to smile . ) SUE Did you get the doctor , Nat ? NAT Yes , he 's coming right away , he promised . ( looking at her face ) What  --  have you been crying ? p. 76 SUE No . ( She walks away from the edge of the cliff , drawing him with her . ) NAT Yes , you have . Look at your eyes . SUE Oh , Nat , everything 's so awful ! ( She breaks down again . ) NAT ( trying to comfort her in an absent-minded way ) There , do n't get worked up . Ma 'll be all right as soon as the doctor comes . ( then curiously ) Pa 's inside with her . They were arguing  --  have they made it up , d' you think ? SUE Oh , Nat , I do n't know . NAT The strain 's been too much for him  --  waiting and hiding his secret from all of us . What do you suppose it is , Sue ? SUE ( wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! NAT Well , there 's something  --  ( starts for the platform . Sue does her best to interpose to hold him back . ) Are they all ready on the schooner ? He 'll have to hurry if she 's going to sail on this tide . ( with sudden passion ) Oh , I 've got to go ! I ca n't stay here ! ( pleadingly ) Do n't you think , Sue , if you were to ask him for me he 'd  --  You 're the only one he seems to act sane with or care about any more . p. 77 SUE No ! I wo n't ! I ca n't ! NAT ( angrily ) Have n't you any sense ? Would n't it be better for everyone if I went in his place ? SUE No . You know that 's a lie . Ma would lose her mind if you went . NAT And I 'll lose mine if I stay ! ( half aware of Sue 's intention to keep him from looking down at the schooner  --  irritably ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see what they 're doing . ( He pushes her aside and goes to the platform  --  excitedly ) Hello , they 've got the fores'l and mains'l set . They 're setting the stays'l. ( in amazement ) Why  --  they 're casting off ! She 's moving away from the wharf ! ( more and more excitedly ) I see four of them on board ! Who  --  who is that , Sue ? SUE It 's Danny . NAT ( furiously ) Danny ! What right has he  --  when I ca n't ! Sue , call Pa ! They 're sailing , I tell you , you little fool ! SUE ( trying to calm him  --  her voice trembling ) Nat ! Do n't be such a donkey ! Danny 's only going a little way  --  just trying the boat to see how she sails while they 're waiting for Pa. p. 78 NAT ( uncertainly ) Oh . ( then bitterly ) I was never allowed to do even that  --  his own son ! Look , Sue , that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes . ( She waves her handkerchief over her head  --  then breaks down , sobbing again . There is the noise of Bartlett 's voice from inside and a moment later he appears in the doorway . He seems terribly shattered , at the end of his tether . He hesitates uncertainly , looking about him wildly as if he did n't know what to do or where to go . ) SUE ( after one look at his face , runs to him and flings her arms about his neck ) Pa ! ( She weeps on his shoulder . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT Sue , ye did wrong beggin ' me to see her . I knowed it 'd do no good . Ye promised she 'd not hound me  --  " Confess , " she says  --  when they be naught to tell that could n't be swore to in any court . " Do n't go on this vige , " she says , " there be the curse o ' God on it . " ( with a note of baffled anguish ) She kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( with wild , haggard defiance ) But curse or no curse , I be goin ' ! ( He moves toward the platform , Sue clinging to his arm. ) p. 79 SUE ( frightenedly ) Pa ! Go back in the house , wo n't you ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT I be sorry to go agin your will , Sue , but it 's got to be . Ye 'll know the reason some day  --  and be glad o ' it . And now good-by to ye . ( With a sudden strange tenderness he bends and kisses his daughter . Then as she seems about to protest further , his expression becomes stern and inflexible . ) No more o ' talk , Sue ! I be bound out . ( He takes her hand off his arm and strides to the platform . One look down at the harbor and he stands transfixed  --  in a hoarse whisper ) What damned trick be this ? ( He points to the schooner and turns to Nat bewilderedly . ) Ai n't that my schooner , boy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAT ( surprised ) Yes , certainly . Did n't you know ? Danny 's trying her to see how she sails while they 're waiting for you . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with a tremendous sigh of relief ) Aye . ( then angrily ) He takes a lot o ' rope to himself without askin ' leave o ' me . Do n't he know they 's no time to waste on boy 's foolin ' ? ( then with admiration ) She sails smart , do n't she , boy ? I knowed she 'd show a pair o ' heels . p. 80 NAT ( with enthusiasm ) Yes , she 's a daisy ! Say , Danny 's taking her pretty far out , is n't he ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( anxiously ) He 'd ought to come about now if he 's to tack back inside the p'int. ( furiously ) Come about , damn ye ! The swab ! That 's what comes o ' steamer trainin ' . I 'd sooner trust Sue to sail her nor him . ( waves his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be heading straight for the open sea . He 's taking quite a sail , it seems to me . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( as if he could n't believe his eyes ) He 's passed the p'int  --  and now  --  headin ' her out to sea  --  so'east by east . By God , that be the course I charted for her ! ( Sue bursts out sobbing . He wheels on her , his mouth fallen open , his face full of a stupid despair . ) They be somethin ' wrong here . What be it , Sue ? What be it , Nat ? ( His voice has begun to quiver with passion . ) That schooner  --  she 's sailin ' without me  --  ( He suddenly springs at Nat and grabs him by the throat  --  with hoarse fury , shaking him ) What be it , ye whelp ? It 's your doin '  --  because I would n't let ye go . Answer me ! p. 81 SUE ( rushing to them with a scream ) Pa ! ( She tugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , stepping back from Nat who sinks weakly to the ground , gasping for breath . Bartlett stands looking at him wildly . ) SUE Nat did n't know , Pa . It 's all my fault . I had to do it . There was no other way  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( raging ) What d'ye mean , girl ? What is it ye 've done ? Tell me , I say ! Tell me or I 'll  --  SUE ( unflinchingly ) You had to be stopped from going some way . So I asked Danny if he would n't make the trip in your place . He 's just got his captain 's papers  --  and oh , Pa , you can trust him , you know that ! That man Horne said he knows about everything you wanted done , and he promised to tell Danny , and Danny 'll come back  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( chokingly ) So  --  that be it  --  ( shaking his clenched fist at the sky as if visualizing the fate he feels in all of this ) Curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength spent , his hand falls limply at his side . ) SARAH ( appears in the doorway . Her face is pale with anguish . She gives a cry of joy when she sees her son . ) Nat ! ( then with a start of horror as her eyes fall on her husband ) Isaiah ! ( He does n't seem to hear . ) Then  --  you ai n't sailed yet ? p. 82 SUE ( going to her  --  gently ) No , Ma , he is n't going to sail . He 's going to stay home with you . But the schooner 's gone . See . ( She points and her mother 's eyes turn seaward . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( aloud to himself  --  in a tone of groping superstitious awe and bewildered fear ) They be somethin ' queer  --  somethin ' wrong  --  they be a curse in this somewhere  --  SARAH ( turning accusing eyes on him  --  with a sort of fanatical triumph ) I 'm glad to hear you confess that , Isaiah . Yes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinfulness o ' men  --  and I thank God He 's saved you from the evil of that voyage , and I 'll pray Him to visit His punishment and His curse on them three men on that craft you forced me to give my name  --  ( She has raised her hand as if calling down retribution on the schooner she can dimly see . ) SUE ( terrified ) Ma ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( starting toward his wife with an insane yell of fury ) Stop it , I tell ye ! ( He towers over her with upraised fist as if to crush her. ) p. 83 SUE Pa ! NAT ( starting to his feet from where he has been sitting on the ground  --  hoarsely ) Pa ! For God 's sake ! SARAH ( gives a weak , frightened gasp ) Would you murder me too , Isaiah ? ( She closes her eyes and collapses in Sue 's arms . ) SUE ( tremblingly ) Nat ! Help me ! Quick ! We must carry her to bed . ( They take their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( while they are doing this , rushes in his mad frenzy to the platform over the edge of the cliff . He puts his hands to his mouth , megaphone-fashion , and yells with despairing rage ) Ahoy ! Ahoy ! Sarah Allen ! Put back ! Put back ! ( asThe Curtain Falls ) @x SCENE  --  About nine o'clock of a moonlight night one year later  --  Captain Bartlett 's " cabin , " a room erected on the top of his house as a lookout post . The interior is fitted up like the cabin of a sailing vessel . On the left , forward , a porthole . Farther back , the stairs of the companionway . Still farther , two more portholes . In the rear , left , a marble-topped sideboard . In the rear , center , a door opening on stairs which lead to the lower house . A cot with a blanket is placed against the wall to the right of door . In the right wall , five portholes . Directly under them , a wooden bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two chairs placed , one in front , one to the left of it . A cheap , dark-colored rug is on the floor . In the ceiling , midway from front to rear , a skylight extending from opposite the door to above the left edge of the table . In the right extremity of the skylight is placed a floating ship 's compass . The light from the binnacle sheds down over this and seeps into the room , casting a vague globular shadow of the compass on the floor . Moonlight creeps in through the portholes on the right . A lighted lantern is on the table . As the curtain rises , Sue and Doctor Berry are discovered sitting by the table . The doctor is a man of sixty or so , hale and hearty-looking , his white hair and mustache setting off his ruddy complexion . His blue eyes have a gentle expression , his smile is kindly and sympathetic . His whole manner toward Sue is that of the old family doctor and deep mourning . She looks much older . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes are alight with some unexpected joy . SUE ( excitedly ) And here is Danny 's letter , Doctor  --  to prove it 's all true . ( She takes a letter from the bosom of her dress and holds it out to him. ) p. 85 DOCTOR BERRY ( takes it with a smile , patting her hand ) I ca n't say how glad I am , Susan . Coming after we 'd all given him up for lost  --  it 's like a miracle . SUE ( smiling happily ) Read what he says . DOCTOR BERRY ( hesitating  --  playfully ) I do n't know that it 's right for me  --  love letters at my age ! SUE I want you to read it . ( He reaches in his pocket for his spectacles . Sue continues gratefully . ) As if I could have any secrets from you after all you 've done for us since Ma died . You 've been the only friend  --  ( She stops , her lips trembling . ) DOCTOR BERRY Tut-tut . ( He adjusts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be of all the service he could to a brave girl like you ? This past year  --  with your mother 's death  --  and then the news of the schooner being reported lost  --  not many could have stood it  --  living in this house with him the way he is  --  even if he was their father . SUE ( glancing up at the skylight  --  apprehensively ) Ssshh ! He might hear you . p. 86 DOCTOR BERRY ( listening intently ) Not him . There he goes pacing up and down , looking out to sea for that ship that will never come back ! ( shaking himself ) Brrr ! This house of mad dreams ! SUE Do n't you think Pa 'll come to realize the schooner is lost as time goes by and she does n't come back ? DOCTOR BERRY No , your father wo n't let himself look the facts in the face . If he did , probably the shock of it would kill him . That darn dream of his has become his life . No , Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder and harder . After observing him for the past year  --  and I speak for his own sake , too , as his good friend for twenty years or more  --  my final advice is the same : Send him to an asylum . SUE ( with a shudder ) No , Doctor . DOCTOR BERRY ( shaking his head ) You 'll have to come to it in time . He 's getting worse . No one can tell  --  he might get violent  --  SUE How can you say that ? You know how gentle and sane he is with me . DOCTOR BERRY You 're his one connecting link with things as they are  --  but that ca n't last . Eh , well , my dear , one thing you 've got to realize : Your father and Nat must be separated somehow . Nat 's going to pieces . I 'll bet he does n't believe that schooner is lost any more than your father does . p. 87 SUE You mean he still hopes it may not be true . That 's only natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report again . He saw in the papers where the British freighter that found the derelict was there and he went to talk with the people on board . I 'm hoping he 'll come back fully convinced , with the whole thing out of his mind . DOCTOR BERRY ( shaking his head  --  gravely ) I 've watched him and talked with him . You 've got to persuade Nat to go away , Susan . SUE ( helplessly ) I do n't know  --  ( then brightening ) Just now it 's enough to know Danny 's alive and coming back . Read his letter , Doctor . DOCTOR BERRY Yes , yes , let 's see . ( He takes the letter from the envelope . ) SUE Poor Danny ! He 's been through terrible things . DOCTOR BERRY Hmm ! Rangoon . SUE Yes , he 's still in the hospital there . You 'll see . DOCTOR BERRY ( reads the letter  --  grunts with astonishment  --  angrily ) By Gad ! The damn scoundrels ! SUE ( shuddering ) Yes , was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for dead in that out of the way native settlement ! And then he was laid up for four months there waiting for a vessel to touch and take him back to civilization . And then , think of it , getting the fever on top of all that and nearly dying in the hospital in Rangoon ! p. 88 DOCTOR BERRY A terrible time of it ! He 's lucky to be alive . Hmm . I see he foresaw the wreck of the schooner. ( folding the letter and putting it back ) He does n't seem to have found out what the purpose of that mad trip was . Horne hid it from him to the last , he says . Well , it 's queer  --  damn queer . But I 'm glad to know those wretches have gone to their final accounting . SUE ( with a shudder ) I was always afraid of them . They looked like  --  murderers . ( At a noise from below they both start . Steps can be heard climbing the stairs . Sue jumps to her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can that be ? ( There is a soft rap on the door . The doctor jumps to his feet . Sue turns to him with a half-hysterical laugh . ) Shall I open ? I do n't know why  --  but I 'm afraid . DOCTOR BERRY Tut-tut ! I 'll see who it is . ( He opens the door and Nat is discovered on the stairs outside . ) Why hello , boy . You gave us a scare . Susan thought it was a ghost knocking . NAT ( comes into the room . He has aged , grown thin , his face gaunt and drawn from continual mental strain , his eyes moody and preoccupied . He glances up at the skylight apprehensively , then turns to Sue . ) I did n't find you downstairs so I  --  ( then to the doctor ) Yes , you do grow to look for ghosts in this house , do n't you ? ( again glancing upward ) He 's up there as usual , I suppose  --  looking for a ship that 'll never , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunt of approval ) I 'm glad to hear you acknowledge that . SUE ( who is just recovering from her fright ) But , Nat , I did n't expect you  --  Did you find out  --  ? NAT Yes , I talked with several of the men who were on board at the time . They said they steamed in so close to the schooner it was easy to read the name with the naked eye . All agreed  --  Sarah Allen , Harborport . They even remembered how her taffrail was painted . There 's no chance for mistake . The Sarah Allen is gone . ( with great emphasis ) And I 'm glad  --  damn glad ! I feel free again , and I can go back to work  --  but not here . I 've got to go away  --  start new altogether . SUE ( happily , coming and putting her arms around him ) It 's so good to hear you talk like your old self again . DOCTOR BERRY ( earnestly ) Yes , Nat , by Gad , that 's sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a queer look ) I suppose you thought I was doomed , eh ?  --  like him . ( He makes a motion upward  --  then with an uncertain laugh ) A doctor 's always looking for trouble where there is n't any . ( in a tone of finality ) Well , it 's all over , anyway . p. 90 SUE ( snatching the letter from the table ) Oh , I was forgetting , Nat . Read this . I got it yesterday . NAT ( turns it over in his hands suspiciously ) Who from ? SUE Open it and see . NAT ( does so and turns over the pages to read the signature  --  he gives a start  --  hoarsely ) Danny ! It ca n't be ! But it 's his writing sure enough ! ( He exclaims with a sudden wild exultation ) Then they must have been lying to me ! SUE No , the Sarah Allen was wrecked all right , but that was afterwards . Read it . You 'll see . ( Nat sinks back on a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the letter with unconcealed indifference , then becomes engrossed , excited , the paper trembling in his hands . The doctor shakes his head at Sue indicating his disapproval of her giving him the letter . Nat finishes and springs to his feet  --  angrily ) NAT The stupid fool ! He let Horne pull the wool over his eyes in fine shape . SUE ( indignantly ) Nat ! NAT ( unheedingly ) Oh , if I could only have gone in his place ! I knew the kind Horne was . He could n't have played that trick on me . I 'd have forced the secret out of him if I had to  --  ( He raises his clenched fist in a gesture of threat like his father 's  --  then lets it fall and sits down again  --  disgustedly ) But what 's the use ? And what 's the use of this ? ( tosses the letter contemptuously on the table ) He might just as well not have written . p. 91 SUE ( snatching up the letter  --  deeply hurt ) Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( turning to her at once  --  with remorseful confusion ) Yes  --  yes  --  of course , Sue  --  I do n't have to say that , do I ? What I mean is , he never found out from Horne  --  and we 're no wiser . DOCTOR BERRY ( briskly  --  with a significant glance at Sue ) Well , Susan  --  Nat  --  I 've got to run along  --  ( meaningly ) I 'll be over again tomorrow , Susan . SUE Yes , do come . ( goes with him to the door ) Can you see your way ? DOCTOR BERRY Yes . Good night . SUE Good night . ( She closes the door and comes back to Nat . The doctor 's footsteps die out . ) NAT ( savagely ) That damned old fool ! What is he doing , sneaking around here all the time ? I 've grown to hate the sight of him . SUE Nat ! You ca n't mean that . Think of how kind he 's been . NAT Yes  --  kindness with a purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose could he have except wanting to help us ? NAT To find out things , of course , you simpleton . To pump Pa when he 's not responsible for what he 's saying . SUE ( indignantly ) Nat ! NAT Much good it 's done him ! I know Pa . Sane or not , he wo n't tell that to anyone  --  not even you or me , Sue . ( with sudden fury ) I 'm going away  --  but before I go I 'm going to make him tell me ! He 's been so afraid I 'd find out , so scared to speak to me even  --  locking himself up here . But I 'll make him tell  --  yes , I will ! SUE Careful , Nat . He 'll hear you if you shout like that . NAT But we have a right to know  --  his own children . What if he dies without ever speaking ? SUE ( uneasily ) Be sensible , Nat . There 's nothing to tell except in your imagination . ( taking his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something to eat . You must be starved , are n't you ? NAT No  --  I do n't know  --  I suppose I ought to be . ( He gets to his feet and glances around with a shudder . ) What a place for him to build to wait in  --  like the cabin of a ship sunk deep under the sea  --  like the Sarah Allen 's cabin as it is now , probably . ( with a shiver ) There 's a chill comes over you . No wonder he 's mad . ( He listens . ) Hear him . A year ago today she sailed . I wonder if he knows that . Back and forth , always staring out to sea for the Sarah Allen . Ha-ha ! God ! It would be funny if it did n't make your flesh creep . ( brusquely ) Come on . Let 's leave him and go down where there 's light and warmth . ( They go down the stairs , closing the door behind them . There is a pause . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut . A gust of wind sweeps down into the room . Bartlett stamps down the stairs . The madness which has taken almost complete possession of him in the past year is clearly stamped on his face , particularly in his eyes which seem to stare through and beyond objects with a hunted , haunted expression . His movements suggest an automaton obeying invisible wires . They are quick , jerky , spasmodic . He appears to be laboring under a state of extraordinary excitement . He stands for a second at the foot of the stairs , peering about him suspiciously . Then he goes to the table and sits down on the edge of a chair , his chin supported on his hands. ) p. 93 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( takes a folded piece of paper from his pocket and spreads it out on the table in the light of the lantern  --  pointing with his finger  --  mumblingly ) Where the cross be  --  ye 'll not forget that , Silas Horne . Ye had a copy o ' this  --  no chance for a mistake , bullies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me and we 'll share it fair and square . A year ago today  --  ye remember the orders I wrote ye , Horne . ( threateningly ) Ye 'll not be gone more nor a year or I 'll  --  and if ye make port to home here at night , hang a red and a green light at the mainm'st head so I 'll see ye comin ' . A red and a green  --  ( He springs up suddenly and goes to a porthole to look out at the sea  --  disappointedly ) No lights be there  --  but they 'll come . The year be up today and ye 've got to come or I 'll  --  ( He sinks back on the chair , his head in his hands . Suddenly he starts and stares straight in front of him as if he saw something in the air  --  with angry defiance ) Aye , there ye be again  --  the two o ' ye ! Makin ' a mock o ' me ! Brass and junk , ye say , not worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll show ye ! ( He springs to his feet and makes a motion as if grabbing someone by the throat and shaking them  --  savagely ) Ye lie ! Is it gold or no ? Answer me ! ( with a mocking laugh ) Aye , ye own up to it now , right enough . Too late , ye swabs ! No share for ye ! ( He sinks back on the chair again  --  after a pause , dully ) Jimmy 's gone . Let them rot . But I spoke no word , Silas Horne , remember ! ( then in a tone of fear ) Be ye dyin ' , Sarah ? No , ye must live  --  live to see your ship come home with the gold  --  and I 'll buy ye all in the world ye set your heart on . No , not ambergris , Sarah  --  gold and diamonds and sech ! We 're rich at last ! ( then with great anguish ) What woman 's stubborn talk be this ? Confess , ye say ? But I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye hound lne and think evil o ' what I done ? Men 's business , I tell ye . They would have killed us and stolen the gold , ca n't ye see ? ( wildly ) Enough o ' talk , Sarah ! I 'll sail out in spite o ' ye ! ( He gets to his feet and paces up and down the room . The door in the rear is opened and Nat renters . He glances at his father , then looks down the stairs behind him cautiously to see if he is followed . He comes in and closes the door behind him carefully. ) p. 94 NAT ( in a low voice ) Pa ! ( then as his father does not appear to notice his presence  --  louder ) Pa ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( stops short and stares at his son as if he were gradually awakening from a dream  --  slowly ) Be that ye , Nat ? NAT ( coming forward ) Yes . I want to talk with you . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( struggling to bring his thoughts under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? Men 's business  --  no room for a boy in it  --  keep clear o ' this . NAT ( defiantly ) That 's what you 've always said . But I wo n't be put off any longer . I wo n't , do you hear ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( angrily ) I 've ordered ye not to set foot in this cabin o ' mine . Git below where ye belong . Where 's Sue ? I told her to keep ye away . NAT She ca n't prevent me this time . I 've made up my mind . Listen , Pa . I 'm going away tomorrow . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( uncertainly ) Goin ' away ? NAT Yes , and I 'm never coming back . I 'm going to start a new life . That 's why I want a final talk with you  --  before I go . p. 95 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( dully ) I 've naught to say to ye . NAT You will have . Listen . I 've absolute proof the Sarah Allen is lost . CAPTAIN BARTLETT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you say that ? You know it 's true . It 's just that you wo n't believe . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( wanderingly  --  the word heading his mind into another channel ) Believe ? Aye , he would n't believe . Brass and junk , he said , not worth a damn  --  but in the end I made him own up ' t was gold . NAT ( repeating the word fascinatedly ) Gold ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT A year ago today she sailed . Ye lie ! Ye do n't believe either , do ye ?  --  like him . But I 'll show ye ! I 'll make ye own up as I made him ! ( with mad exultation ) She 's comin ' home tonight as I ordered Horne she must ! I kin feel her makin ' for home , I tell ye ! A red an ' a green at the mainm'st head if ye make port o ' night , I ordered Horne . Ye 'll see ! ( He goes to look out of a porthole . Nat , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAT ( turning away disappointedly  --  making an effort to throw off his thoughts  --  without conviction ) Nonsense . There 's nothing there  --  no lights  --  and I do n't believe there ever will be . p. 96 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( his wild eyes fixed on his son 's with an intense effort of will as if he were trying to break down his resistance ) Ye 'll see , I tell ye  --  a red and a green ! It ai n't time yet , boy , but when it be they 'll be plain in the night afore your eyes . ( He goes and sits down by the table . Nat follows him and sits down in the other chair . He sees the map and stares at it fascinatedly . ) NAT What is this  --  the map of the island ? ( He reaches out his hand for it . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( snatching it up  --  with a momentary return to reason  --  frightenedly ) Not for ye , boy . Keep clear o ' this for your own good . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe this soon enough , would n't ye ? NAT ( intensely ) I 've always believed there was something  --  and a moment ago you mentioned gold . ( triumphant in his turn ) So you need n't try to hide the secret any longer . I know now . It 's gold  --  gold you found on that island  --  gold you fitted out the Sarah Allen to sail back for  --  gold you buried where I saw that cross marked on the map ! ( passionately ) Why have you been afraid to confide in me , your own son ? Did you think I would n't believe  --  ? p. 97 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with a mad chuckle ) Aye , ye believe now , right enough . NAT I always believed , I tell you . ( pleadingly ) And now that I know so much why ca n't you tell me the rest ? I must know ! I have a right to be heir to the secret . Why do n't you confess  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT  --  ( interrupting  --  his brain catching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sarah ? To Nat , did ye mean ? Aye , Sarah , I 'll tell him all and leave it to him to say if I did wrong . ( his gleaming eyes fixed on his son 's ) I 'll tell ye , boy , from start to finish o ' it . I been eatin ' my heart to tell someone  --  someone who 'd believe  --  someone that 'd say I did no wrong . Listen , boy , ye know o ' our four days in an open boat after the Triton went down . I told ye o ' that when I come home . But what I did n't tell ye was they was six o ' us in that boat , not four . NAT Six ? There were you and Horne and Cates and Jimmy  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT The cook o ' the Triton and the ship 's boy . We 'd been on the island two days  --  an island barren as hell , mind  --  without food or drink . We was roasted by the sun and nigh mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seed a Malay canoe  --  a proper war canoe such as the pirates use  --  sunk down inside the reef . I sent Jimmy down to go over her thinkin ' they might be some cask o ' water in her the sea 'd not got to . ( with impressive emphasis ) He found no water , boy , but he did find  --  d'ye know what , boy ? p. 98 NAT ( exultantly ) The gold , of course ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( laughing harshly ) Ha-ha ! Ye do believe right enough , do n't ye ! Aye , the gold  --  in a chest . We hauled her up ashore and forced the lid open . ( gloatingly ) And there it was afore our eyes in the sun  --  gold bracelets and rings and ornaments o ' all sorts fixed up fancy with diamonds and emeralds and rubies and sech  --  red and green  --  shinin ' in the sun ! ( He stops impressively . ) NAT ( fascinatedly ) Diamonds and  --  But how did they get there ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT Looted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how it come about ? There it was afore our eyes . And then , mind ye , that thief o ' a cook came runnin ' up from where he 'd been shirkin ' to look at what we 'd found . " No share for ye , ye swab , " I yelled at him ; and then he says : " It ai n't gold  --  brass and junk , " he says and run off for fear o ' me . Aye , he run off to the boy and told him to jine with his sneakin ' plan to steal the gold from us ! NAT ( savagely ) But why did n't you stop him ? Why did n't you  --  ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT I be comin ' to that boy , and ye 'll see if I did wrong . We carried the chest to the shade o ' a palm and there was that thief o ' a cook an ' the boy waitin ' . I collared ' em both and made ' em look at the gold . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I says . ( triumphantly ) They was afeerd to lie . Even that thief o ' a cook owned up ' t was gold . Then when I turned ' em loose , because he knowed he 'd git no share , he shouted again : " Brass and junk . Not worth a damn . " p. 99 NAT ( furiously ) But why did you allow  --  Why did n't you  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with mad satisfaction ) Aye , ye be seein ' the way o ' it , boy . It was just then we sighted the schooner that picked us up after . We made a map and was buryin ' the gold when we noticed them two thieves sneakin ' about to see where we 'd hide it . I saw ' em plain , the scum ! That thief o ' a cook was thinkin ' he 'd tell the folks on the schooner and go shares with them  --  and leave us on the island to rot ; or he was thinkin ' he and the boy 'd be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had to do somethin ' quick to spile their plan afore the schooner come . ( in a tone of savage satisfaction ) And so  --  though I spoke no word to him  --  Jimmy knifed ' em both and covered ' em up with sand . But I spoke no word , d'ye hear ? Their deaths be on Jimmy 's head alone . NAT ( passionately ) And what if you had ? They deserved what they got . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Then ye think I did no wrong ? NAT No ! Any man  --  I 'd have done the same myself . CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( gripping his son 's hand tensely ) Ye be true son o ' mine , Nat . I ought to told ye before . ( exultantly ) Ye hear , Sarah ? Nat says I done no wrong . p. 100 NAT The map ! Can I see it ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT Aye . ( He hands it to Nat who spreads it out on the table and pores over it . ) NAT ( excitedly ) Why , with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sarah Allen is lost . CAPTAIN BARTLETT She ai n't lost , boy  --  not her . Do n't heed them lies ye been hearin ' . She 's due now . I 'll go up and look . ( He goes up the companionway stairs . Nat does not seem to notice his going , absorbed in the map . Then there is a loud muffled hail in Bartlett 's voice . ) Sarah Allen , ahoy ! ( Nat starts , transfixed  --  then rushes to one of the portholes to look . He turns back , passing his hand over his eyes , frowning bewilderedly . The door above is flung open and slammed shut and Bartlett stamps down the stairs . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( fixing Nat hypnotically with his eyes  --  triumphantly ) What did I tell ye ? D'ye believe now she 'll come back ? D'ye credit your own eyes ? NAT ( vaguely ) Eyes ? I looked . I did n't see  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ye lie ! The Sarah Allen , ye blind fool , come back from the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I swore she would be !  --  makin ' port !  --  droppin ' her anchor just when I hailed her . p. 101 NAT ( feebly , his will crumbling ) But  --  how do you know ?  --  some other schooner  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT Not know my own ship  --  and the signal I 'd ordered Horne to make ! NAT ( mechanically ) I know  --  a red and a green at the mainm'st head . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Then look out if ye dare ! ( He goes to a porthole . ) Ye kin see it plain from here . ( commandingly ) Will ye believe your eyes ? Look ! ( Nat comes to him slowly  --  looks through the porthole  --  and starts back , a possessed expression coming over his face . ) NAT ( slowly ) A red and a green  --  clear as day ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( His face is now transfigured by the ecstasy of a dream come true . ) They 've lowered a boat  --  the three  --  Horne an ' Cates and Jimmy Kanaka . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oars in the locks . Listen ! NAT ( staring into his father 's eyes  --  after a pause during which he appears to be straining his hearing to the breaking point  --  excitedly ) I hear ! p. 102 CAPTAIN BARTLETT Listen ! They 've landed . They 'll be comin ' up the path now . ( in a crooning , monotonous tone ) They move slowly  --  slowly . It be heavy , I know  --  that chest . ( after a pause ) Hark ! They 're below at the door in front . NAT I hear ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT Ye 'll see it now in a moment , boy  --  the gold . Up with it , bullies ! Up ye come ! Up , bullies ! It 's heavy , heavy ! NAT ( madly ) I hear them ! They 're on the floor below ! They 're coming ! I 'll open the door . ( He springs to the door and flings it open , shouting ) Welcome home , boys ! ( Sue is discovered outside just climbing up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking with amazement and horror from father to brother . Nat pushes her roughly aside to look behind her down the stairs . ) SUE Nat ! NAT ( turning to his father ) I 'll go down to the wharf . They must be there or  --  ( The rest of his words are lost as he hurries down the stairs . Bartlett steps back , shrinking away from his daughter , and sinks on a chair by the table with a groan , his hands over his eyes. ) p. 103 SUE ( comes to him and shakes him by the shoulder  --  alarmed ) Pa ! What has happened ? What is the matter with Nat ? What have you told him ? ( with bitter despair ) Oh , ca n't you see you 're driving him mad , too ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( letting his hands fall and staring at her haggardly  --  falteringly , as if reason were slowly filtering back into his brain ) Sue  --  ye said  --  drivin ' him mad , too ! Then ye think I be  --  ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing . Bartlett falters on . ) But I seen her  --  the Sarah Allen  --  the signal lights  --  SUE Oh , Pa , there 's nothing there ! You know it ! She was lost months ago . CAPTAIN BARTLETT Lost ? ( He stumbles over to a porthole and looks out . His body sags as if he were going to fall . He turns away and cries hopelessly in a tone of heart-rending grief ) Lost ! Aye , they be no Sarah Allen there  --  no lights  --  nothin ' ! SUE ( pleading fiercely ) Pa , you 've got to save Nat ! He wo n't heed anyone else . Ca n't you tell him the truth  --  the whole truth whatever it is  --  now when I 'm here and you 're yourself again  --  and set him free from this crazy dream ! p. 104 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( with wild grief ) Confess , ye mean ? Sue , ye be houndin ' me like your Ma did to her dyin ' hour ! Confess  --  that I spoke the word to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk  --  not worth a damn ! ( in frenzied protest ) No ! Ye lie ! SUE Oh , Pa , I do n't know what you mean . Tell Nat the truth ! Save him ! CAPTAIN BARTLETT The truth ? It 's a lie ! ( as Sue tries to bar his way to the companionway  --  sternly ) Out o ' my way , girl ! ( He pulls himself feebly up the stairs . The door is heard slamming above . Sue sits down in a chair in a hopeless , exhausted attitude . After a pause Nat renters . He is panting heavily from his exertions . His pale face is set in an expression of despair . ) NAT ( looking about the room wildly ) Where is he ? Sue ! ( He comes forward and falls on his knees besides her chair , hiding his face in her lap like a frightened child . He sobs hoarsely ) Sue ! What does it all mean ? I looked . There was nothing there  --  no schooner  --  nothing . SUE ( soothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course there was n't . Did you expect there would be , you foolish boy ? Come , you know better than that . Why , Nat , you told the doctor and I that you were absolutely convinced the Sarah Allen was lost . p. 105 NAT ( dully ) Yes , I know  --  but I do n't believe  --  like him  --  SUE Sshhhh ! You know the state Pa is in . He does n't realize what he 's saying half the time . You ought to have better sense than to pay any attention  --  NAT ( excitedly ) But he told me all he 's been hiding from us  --  all about the gold ! SUE ( looking at him with alarm  --  mystified ) Gold ? ( then forcing a smile ) Do n't be silly , Nat . It does n't exist except in his poor , deranged mind . NAT ( fiercely ) That 's a lie , Sue ! I saw the map , I tell you  --  the map of the island with a cross marked on it where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  a real map ? ( gently ) Are you sure you 're not just imagining that , too ? NAT I had it in my hands , you fool , you ! There  --  on the table . ( He springs to his feet , sees the map on the table , and snatches it up with an exclamation of joy  --  showing it to Sue ) See ! Now will you believe me ! ( She examines the map perplexedly . Nat paces up and down  --  excitedly ) I tell you it 's all true . You ca n't deny it now . It 's lucky for us I forced him to confess . He might have died keeping the secret and then we 'd have lost  --  I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do now , Sue . I 'm going to raise the money somewhere , somehow , and fit out another schooner and this time I 'll sail on her myself . No trusting to Danny or anyone else ! Yes , Sue , we 'll come into our own yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stops  --  then in accents of bewildered fear ) But  --  she ca n't be lost  --  I saw the lights , Sue  --  as plain as I see you now  --  ( He goes to one of the portholes again. ) p. 106 SUE ( who has been watching him worriedly , puts the map back on the table , gets up and , assuming a brisk , matter-of-fact tone , she goes over and takes him by the arm ) Come downstairs , Nat . Do n't think any more about it tonight . It 's late and you 're worn out . You need rest and a good sleep . NAT ( following her toward the door  --  confusedly ) But Sue  --  I saw them  --  ( From above in the night comes the muffled hail in Bartlett 's voice , " Sarah Allen , ahoy ! " Nat stops , tortured , his hands instinctively raised up to cover his ears . Sue gives a startled cry . The door above is slammed and Bartlett comes down the stairs , his face revealing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( pointing his finger at his son and fixing him with his eyes  --  in ringing , triumphant tones ) The Sarah Allen , boy  --  in the harbor below ! Come back from the Southern Seas as I swore she must ! Loaded with gold as I swore she would be ! ( Nat again seems to crumble  --  to give way to the stronger will . He takes a step toward his father , his eyes lighting up . Sue looks at his face  --  then rushes to her father . ) SUE ( putting her hands to her father 's head and forcing him to look down into her face  --  intensely ) Pa ! Stop , do you hear me ! It 's all mad ! You 're driving Nat mad , too ! ( As she sees her father hesitate , the wild light dying out of his eyes , she summons all her power to a fierce pleading . ) For my sake , Pa ! For Ma 's sake ! Think of how she would feel if she were alive and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell him now  --  before me  --  tell him it 's all a lie ! p. 107 CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( trying in an agony of conflict to get hold of his reason  --  incoherently ) Yes , Sue  --  I hear ye  --  confess  --  aye , Sarah , your dyin ' words  --  keep Nat clear o ' this  --  but  --  red and green  --  I seen ' em plain  --  ( then suddenly after a tremendous struggle , lifting his tortured face to Nat 's  --  in tones of despair ) Nothin ' there , boy ! Do n't ye believe ! No red and green ! She 'll never come ! Derelict and lost , boy , the Sarah Allen . ( after another struggle with himself ) And I lied to ye , boy . I gave the word  --  in my mind  --  to kill them two . I murdered ' em in cold blood . SUE ( shrinking from him in horror ) Pa ! You do n't know what you 're saying . CAPTAIN BARTLETT The truth , girl . Ye said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . They were trying to steal  --  CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( overcome by the old obsession for a moment  --  savagely ) Aye , that 's it ! The thievin ' scum ! They was tryin '  --  ( He stops short , throwing his head back , his whole body tense and quivering with the effort he makes to force this sustaining lie out of his brain  --  then , broken but self-conquering , he looks again at Nat  --  gently ) No , Nat . That be the lie I been tellin ' myself ever since . That cook  --  he said ' t was brass  --  But I 'd been lookin ' for ambergris  --  gold  --  the whole o ' my life  --  and when we found that chest  --  I had to believe , I tell ye ! I 'd been dreamin ' o ' it all my days ! But he said brass and junk , and told the boy  --  and I give the word to murder ' em both and cover ' em up with sand . p. 108 NAT ( very pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is gold  --  real gold  --  is n't it ? CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( slowly takes the studded anklet from his pocket and holds it out to Nat . The latter brings it to the light of the lantern . Bartlett sits on a chair , covering his face with his hands  --  in a tone of terrible suffering . ) Ye 'll tell me , boy  --  if it 's gold or no . I 've had it by me all this time  --  but I 've been afeerd to show  --  NAT ( in a tone of wild scorn ) Why , it 's brass , of course ! The cheapest kind of junk  --  not worth a damn ! ( He flings it savagely into a corner of the room . Bartlett groans and seems to shrink up and turn into a figure of pitiable feebleness . ) SUE ( pityingly ) Do n't , Nat . ( She puts her arms around her father 's shoulders protectingly . ) NAT ( in a stifled voice ) What a damned fool I 've been ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) CAPTAIN BARTLETT ( uncovers his gray face on which there is now settling an expression of strange peace  --  stroking his daughter 's hand ) Sue  --  do n't think hard o ' me . ( He takes the map . ) An end to this ! ( He slowly tears it into small pieces , seeming to grow weaker and weaker as he does so . Finally as he lets the fragments filter through his fingers , his whole frame suddenly relaxes . He sighs , his eyes shut , and sags back in his chair , his head bent forward limply on his chest. ) p. 109 SUE ( alarmed ) Pa ! ( She sinks to her knees beside him and looks up into his face . ) Pa ! Speak to me ! It 's Sue ! ( then turning toward her brother  --  terrifiedly ) Nat ! Run  --  get the doctor  --  ( Nat starts to a sitting position . Sue tries with trembling hands to feel of her father 's pulse , his heart  --  then begins to sob hysterically. )  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
