Southern notables assembled last week at Fletcher , N. C. , to sing a song and unveil a tablet to the song 's author , Daniel Decatur Emmett , who , though he never took his stand or lived or died south of the Mason &; Dixon line , * nevertheless composed both the words and music of " Dixie . " Son of Ohio and buried there , Composer Emmett is the adopted son of all " Dixieland . " Yet the scene last week in the cemetery of Calvary Episcopal Church at Fletcher ( " outdoor Westminster Abbey of the South " ) was the first of their kind ; the tablet , Composer Emmett 's first in the South . <P> Composer Emmett never regarded " Dixie " as his ablest creation .

The words for the tune had been suggested to him by a grumble he had often heard on the lips of circus performers " up North " when nippy autumn nights set in : " I wish - I was in Dixie 's land . " <P> To the original draft Minstrel Emmett put a few new touches , rhymed " cotton " and " forgotten , " changed the tempo , handed his chief what he felt was a botched job . But next evening , the audience swayed to the new tune , caught the words easily , especially the " hoorays . " It was one of those songs that people sing leaving the theatre . Soon the whole country sang it , echoing it into the end of last week . <P> <P> * The boundary ( Lat. 39 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was surveyed in 1763-67 by Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon who were sent over from England to settle the dispute between the Baltimore and Penn families following Charles IPs grant to William Penn .
