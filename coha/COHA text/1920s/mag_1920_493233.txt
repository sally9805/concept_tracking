fluences are at work to draw them to this country , what happens to them after they get here , how their coming , bears upon our own current social and economic problems . America needs a definite im ? migration policy , which shall make it possible to differentiate between those who have the intelli ? gence and initiative to seek entrance to America on their own account and those who are recruited for emigration by the steamship companies , by em ? ployers seeking cheap and docile labor , by govern ? ments desiring to expel recalcitrant minorities , by philanthropic organizations that would solve par ? ticular problems of European poverty through their removal to America . We ought not to tolerate any kind of mass immigration or subsidized im ? migration . Selection is necessary , but it is far from the whole of a sound immigration policy . We can not afford to have even the best selected immigrants dumped at our ports , to fall , very likely , into the hands of exploiters , and , at the best , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go far toward setting them against America . Immigration is economically a matter of labor sup ? ply and can not be handled intelligently except as related to the demand for labor throughout the country . But we are so far from a systematic over ? sight of the labor demand that intelligent men are now asserting that we are suffering from a shortage of labor and other equally intelligent men are asserting that there is not a class of labor of which we do not have a plethora . We shall never handle mmigration rationally so long as this condition obtains . We are not now organized to receive immigrants properly , or to distribute them in such a way as to insure ourselves against aggravation of the present evils of increasing unemployment and labor unrest . To work out a satisfactory national policy will re ? quire months ; but in the meantime multitudes , in almost every European country , are restless and discontented , and the shipping companies are cast ? ing eager eyes upon the earnings to be had from mass emigration . What else can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but declare a truce to immigration ? A year 's suspension to immigration ought to suf ? fice , if the working out of a national policy is under ? taken in good faith . But such a truce will be of no value unless we actually use the time to overhaul our entire immigration policy . If we stop with the truce , the disadvantages of indefinite restriction will presently impress themselves upon us when our industry again takes an upward swing and we shall remove all barriers and let in a flood probably not so desirable in its constituent elements as that which it is now proposed to exclude . // American Business Depression and European Distress THERE was a time when even the fairly well informed Americans might cherish the illusion that the United States was economically independ ? ent of Europe . We could produce for ourselves the food and raw materials we required ; we pos ? sessed the manufacturing power to supply our needs ; what , then , had we to do with Europe ? But we have since learned better than to comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priate material for spread eagle orations . Through out the country mills are closing down and unern employment is growing apace . From the price level of last spring , on which the farmer based his cal ? culations when he plowed and sowed , agricultural products have fallen so disastrously as to involve losses according to the estimate of the National City Bank of between six and eight billions . That loss in purchasing power necessarily reflects itself in the demand for industrial products , with corre ? sponding losses to industry probably greatly exceed ' mg the agricultural loss . Without a doubt , the national production , measured in money values , is at least a billion a month less than it was a year ago . That is in part due to the inevitable deflation and readjustment after the fever of war . Some decline in price levels was inevitable . Many bank ' ruptcies were due , in consequence of the cumulative effect of business vices condoned or overlooked time of war . But nobody can believe for 3 moment that those inherent weaknesses count for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by the failure of Europe to return to the normal processes of peace . There would not be in fact a world surplus of wheat and cotton , wool and leather , copper and iron and steel . products , if those who stand in need of those materials were in a position to buy . Indeed , We shall not know for months whether existing wheat : stocks will suffice to feed the world until the 11 ? harvest , and by all the indicia of normal - world consumption there ought to be a demand sumo-or December 22 , 1920 THE NEW not in fact extending credit in considerable volume . Our large monthly excess of exports proves that We are . Dr. B. M. Anderson calculates that Europe 's floating indebtedness to us now exceeds three billions . That sum represents chiefly credits extended to British business men , who have in turn extended something like the same volume of credit to their continental customers . These facts ought to dispose of any lingering notion that solvent bor rowers are not to be found in Europe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Philanthropy . It follows that if we set about it In a big , organized way we could even now , in Spite of European chaos , place a large volume of our surplus products abroad , with perfect safety . ? ur business men are not children , incompetent to look after their interests in markets where British business men are winning comfortable profits . Where the British exporter has an advantage in the intensive exploitation of the European , market is in an investing public accustomed to take his foreign bills off his hands , releasing his capital for further operatiOns . We may in time parallel this advantage through the organization of cor ? Porations under the Edge law . In time ; but com ? mercial depression is at our doors . That is the real justification for the demand , for the resuscita ? tion of the War Finance Corporation , so calmly Put under ether by Secretary Houston , apparently under the conviction that a commercial depression cutting ten billions off the national income is to be Preferred to the possible losses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move our surplus products to the consumers who need them . The agricultural West and South do not share this Conviction , to judge from the attitude of the rep ? resentatives of those sections in Congress . On this point , the farmers and bankers seem to agree ? Portent of the times . It is an enormous advance in our national edu ? eation in economics to recognize that our prosperity is bound up with our foreign markets , which we must supply on credit when we can not get cash . But our national education is not therewith fin ? ished . It is not enough to set some part of our Present surplus stocks moving through the exten ? sion of credits to our foreign customers . We can ? not contemplate with comfort a steady increase in our European credits unless at the same time the structure of European economic life becomes more stable . With the whole continent flooded with Paper money of dubious value ; with France , Italy and Germany unable to balance their budgets and he accumulating deficits threatening increased financial disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with or against the victors in the late war , how can the orderly business of production get under way ? Yet it is upon production that the ultimate payment of any credits we may extend to Europe must depend . And it is with a Europe producing goods in abund ? ance that we must cooperate in future if we are to make the most of our own natural resources . Let us ignore for the moment , if we can , all humanitarian considerations . We will not enter as a credit the difference between the starving European populations of today and the same populations fully employed and adequately fed and clothed . Let us ignore all considerations of world peace , forgetting that in the chronic misery now settled upon the greater part of Europe militarist and monarchist plots thrive amazingly . Let us disregard the subtle forces of social contagion , that transmit the moral consequences of economic dis ? integration in ever widening circles . We are con ? cerned here just with the definite effects of Euro ? pean economic decay upon our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preliminary taste in the current depression of our industry and agri ? culture . Is that not enough to convince us that we have been shortsighted in treating European econ ? omic recovery as purely the affair of Europe ? If we had been as farsighted as we were in fact shortsighted , we should have recognized at the outset that the German indemnity , so long as it should remain indefinite , or , after being fixed , if placed above a reasonable figure , was inevitably a centre of corruption , eating , out the tissue of Euro ? pean economic life . The French have counted on the indemnity to ward off the consequences of an extravagant policy of meddling in the affairs of central and eastern Europe and Asia Minor . They have used it to excuse a fiscal incompetence that steadily lowers the credit of the French govern ? ment . The Germans , threatened with burdens in ? creasing with every sign of recovery , have tailed to address themselves to the work of paying what is reasonably due from them . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retard economic recovery in Austria and Hun ? gary , Czecho-Slovakia and Poland , and even in Italy and Greece . Americans need not look be ? yond our own economic depression to gain a reali ? zation of the potency for evil of the German in ? demnity . But was there anything we could have done about it at the time of the Peace Conference , or that we can still do ? Yes . Mr. Baruch has pointed out that our commissioners pressed for a fixed and moderate indemnity , foreseeing exactly the conse ? - quences of a policy of punitive overreaching . But our representatives were eloquent in words , not in deeds . They advised the Allies not to drop the substance of an indemnity that would be paid while // grasping for the shadow of one that would not be . At the same time the American representatives re fused to recognize that they too were grasping for a shadow ? the repayment of the ten billions loaned to our Allies to aid them in the prosecution of our common war against Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repayment as of the utmost importance . If we had been willing to consider it , we could have taken a dominant part in the writing of the reparation clauses of the Treaty . We could have compelled England to release France and Italy from their debt to England by cancelling our own claims on England . We could have compelled France to content herself with an indemnity from Germany fixed at such an amount that indemnity bonds would be actually salable . France would then have been in a position to rehabilitate her finances forth ? with and to proceed rapidly with her economic re ? habilitation . Germany could have gone to work at once to pay off her indemnity . Italy would have secured material relief from the fiscal burdens press ? ing upon her and would have shared in the grow ? ing economic prosperity of Europe . All these benefits had to be foregone because of the refusal of our own representatives to consider on any terms the remission of our claims upon our Allies . They refused to consider the proposal because they thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generosity to our Allies , though in the long run it might turn out to be the shrewd ? est practical policy for ourselves . Perhaps our commissioners were right in their estimate of the temper of Congress . At that time Americans were still saying , " Now the war is over , we are through with Europe . " But today we all know better . Is it too late to mend the mistakes of Versailles ? We do not believe that . Let America announce that she is willing to enter an Inter-Allied Congress , to consider ways of re ? habilitating the financial and economic life of her European customers , indicating her willingness to consider the remission of her war claims upon her late associates , provided they are ready to join in creating the conditions of real economic peace . Is there the least reason for supposing that such a proposal would be rejected ? The Allied states ? men know well enough that they will never get out of Germany and Austria the exaggerated sums their peoples have been led to expect . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the burden of war debt through in ? demnity payment . If , however , America took the initiative toward revision , exhibiting at the same time her willingness to assume sacrifices herself , the matter could be presented to the Allied peoples in another light It may be said that we are proposing to buy moderation and common sense of our European Allies at an expense of ten billions to ourselves . Let us face frankly the history of those loans to our Allies . We entered the war when France and Italy , and England , too , for that matter , were near the end of their financial tethers . We could have refused stolidly to lend them money , reserving our funds for our own war-making . Suppose we had done so . Our Allies would probably have per severed in fighting , but certainly they would have been compelled to limit their operations to the most rigorously defensive requirements . We should have faced a much more powerful Germany , when at last we were ready to fight , and in all prob ability the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thirty billions to our war debt . Is it surprising that Frenchmen and English ? men and Italians do not feel that the equities are on our side when we seek to recover those ten billions ? They agreed , however , to pay back our money ' They will pay it back , if they can . But can they ? Down to the present they have not been able to meet even the interest . And how soon shall we be taking from abroad three-quarters of a billion of imports annually in excess of our exports ? an amount we should have to take to extinguish the debt in a generation ? Our Allies are demanding from Germany sots that exceed what is equitable and practicable . We are demanding from our Allies sums beyond the equitable and practicable . They are grasping at shadows , and so are we . And in the meantime the substance of our prosperity slips away . How long are we to be ravaged by such folly and its conse ? consequences ? It all lies with the American people , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general good .
