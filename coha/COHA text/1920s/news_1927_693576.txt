txt " I am engaged to be married to a widower a few years my senior . He and his wife were separated for some years before she died . 2dy mother and =fame of my friends criticize him to me. rhey say if he could n't get along with ) ne wife , he could n't with a second . Do you think a girl is foolish to risk marrying a widower ? " The popular supposition , on the contrary , is that a widower is no risk at all , that your predecessor has neatly dispatched any number of the disturbing illusions and faults or prickly mannerisms that were no use to the man , anyway . You have a perfectly trained specimen in the mate with an earlier matrimonial experience . It there were children , they would lend an element of risk , but you mention none and children are not that easily disposed of , if present .

If you and your widower have these , then you may turn a deaf ear on criticism from either your mother or friends . If , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made his first wife 's life unhappy through no fault of hers  --  then he would be a bad risk . If he were cruel or domineering , selfish , or brutal he could not make any one of ten women he might marry rejoice In the union . It 's by a man 's character , after all , more than by his experiences , that you judge him . - EMBARRASSING MOMENTS The Tribune will pay $1 for every letter Published on " The Moat Embarrassing Moment of MY Life , " Address rasing Momenta , Chicago Tribune .
