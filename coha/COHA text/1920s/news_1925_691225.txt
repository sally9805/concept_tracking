txt One of the best if not the best known Florida ports is Tampa . Of its population of about 100,000 , half is CubanSpanish . Although the winter atmosphere is cool and in. vigoraing as compared with farther down the coast , its residence land opportunities were not appreciated until recently . Dave P. Davis ' got permission to dredge and build islands in the shallow waters to the north of the commercial harbor . Before the dredge arrived he was able to sell S3,000,000 worth of lots that were still under water . Dredging began six months ago . The islands are rising to make miles of water front and buildings are already under way . Residences will be of hollow tile and restricted . The water between these islands and the Bay Shore Drive of Tampa . half a mile away , has a depth of only about six feet . - The Bay Shore Drive is the-high class residential district and the lands have a rating of about $1000 per front foot . The student of the beautiful is more impressed by the hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? than with the beauties of the big hotel Plant donated to the town ? in consideration of $100,000  --  and now In a public park . Were both now privately owned , beauty and enterprise might again show itself . Tampa : s at the head of Tampa or Hillsborough Bay , in the centre of the west coast and more than 30 miles from deep water on the Gulf . On the west side of its harbor is the Inter-bay Peninsula and on its west is Old Tampa Day , whose shallow waters have twice the surface area of the bay on which Tampa itself is situated . West of this is a large and broad peninsula reaching some miles up the coast north of Tampa and southward to a terminus at least 15 miles below Tampa . St. Petersburg stretches across this peninsula three to four miles north of its extreme southern point , is little more than a mile wide runs about six miles east and west and has a Tampa Bay frontage of about three miles . Here human enterprise in land and residence development has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest and most distinctive scientific landfdevelopment in Florida . St. Petersburg , if enterprising , is modest in some of its claims . It does n't claim that it is the permanent residence of more than 35.000 people , but it boasts a winter population of 120.000 , and its population altogether is of the highest type . So great is the winter crowd , it is difficult . to get in or out of the banks . Other cities may have this boast , but no others can have the boast that people Con tin ucd on Thirteenth Pane Florida by the LA ND ' VALUES Land at St. Petersburg has sold as high as $5.000 per front foot in the business section and in the shore residential section as high as $2,000 per front foot , where it carried the riparian rights . On the other side of the ocean boulevard lots bring as high as $35,000 . The ordinary lot has a 50-foot front and may run back as far as 90 or 150 feet ; but as a rule you can figure that lots fronting the Shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about $6 per square foot . Such prices mean residences of value and taste with hedges , tropical trees and piazzas and pergolas buried in bougainvillea and " Flame of the Woods " vines . The banana is allowed to grow wild , but " mamas " hate it , for when children try to climb the stalks the banana tree stain is fount to be permanent . St. Petersburg needs only one improvement and that is the turning over to the Board of Trade , or some other private enterprise , the operation of its public utilities . The telephone was nearly wrecked by attempted public operation . But the street cars are operated by the city for a financial loss and the city can make no money out of its gas at $1.25 a thousand . In 191 ' a banker held a $25.000 mortgage upon land in what is now the centre of the city 's six miles . Fearful that he would become the possessor of this land , he s , ld his mortgage at a sacrifice of $3.000 .

Taylor , formerly in the fisheries business of the northern statesahas made a wonderful and rapid development supplementing or crowning St. Petersburg 's local development ; and this development is called Pasadena . Taylor came here 32 months ago and took over $100,000 worth of land for improvement . Then , noting the progress . he took an option on an additional 1,400 acres at . $130 an acre , making altogether 1,800 acres . Throwing his money quickly into development , he was able to sell lots enough to take up his first options , so that his total cash investment in the enterprise was but $130,000 . Last year his 120 salesmen found buyers for $3,000.000 worth of lots , one-third cash down . It is estimated that Taylor has sold land altogether for about $10,000,000 .

Fuller Construction Co. , which begins this month the construction here of a new $350,000 hotel . The Rolyat  --  you can spell it backwards if you want to -- whica ? will set in 10 acres of ground . The golf course will have 194 acres . Ile has a $250,000 nursery with 100,000 hibiscus cutting . 1,000.000 Australian pines ; and never anything is sold from this nursery . Everything is free together with the se/ vices of a landscape gardener to beautify the estates and the 250 houses built on the property , all of which- except half a dozen have been sold . No cheap houses are allowed and the architecture must be harmonious with the surroundings . The cost of houses ranges from $20,000 to $40,000 and the lots average about $10,000 .

Taylor removed about a quarter of a million dead trees and stumps to make room for this development . Native pines were thinned out and Australian pines planted . A 6% interest rate for deferred payments may have been an ? attractive feature ht Pasadena in a state where everything at the bank " loans at 8% , notwithstanding the low Federal Reserve rate to banks . Taylor 's deferred payments were at 6% and this advantage to his buyers . For himself he has
