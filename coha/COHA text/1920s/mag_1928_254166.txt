All the king 's horses , at least all those he uses for racing , and all the king 's men , anyway all those he knows by their first names , went down to Ascot Heath last week . Whether it is rainy or the sun is shining , the King and all smart Britishers must go to Ascot every year . From Windsor with his good wife and the Prince of Wales he drove through the rain in a landau drawn by six perfectly matched greys mounted by postillions in scarlet coats frogged with gold . He saw Lord Derby 's Toboggan , a nice bay filly , win the $25,000 Coronation Stakes while his own horse , Scuttle , came in third ; he saw Brown Jack win the Royal Ascot Stakes by three lengths from Bonny Boy II , and he saw Maid of Perth win the Golden Vase that has his name on it . <P> Near the green grass course at Longchamps , France , is a small pond in which they say Sir Launcelot , weary with the weight of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed by the weight of his jockey , Largo , one of the horses entered in the Grand Prix , last week , cantered wildly . The crowd of gentlemen in tall grey hats and ladies in wide flat hats stared and murmured . They were afraid Largo 's antics would unnerve the favorite Flamingo . With Largo off the course , the other horses started , rounded the curve of the turf in the sunshine with Croix de Guerre , owned by Ogden Mills ( father of the U. S. Under Secretary of the Treasury ) carrying Jockey Esling and the numeral 13 , beating Baron .
