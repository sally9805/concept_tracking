txt Christmas . Day and we are ? at ' the ice barrier . That formidable , arid glistening symbol of the ithpregnability of this desolate : land which Commander Byrd is about to explore by ' the air appeared before us late this evening , a great wall Of white on the distant horizon . Before midnight we should ' be coasting along the face of it , our first real contact with the continent on which we will live for a year . We sighted it just after our Christmas celebration in the forecastle , when every one received ' presents and celebrated with songs and talks , some of humor and some charged with the feeling of . what all this Christmas means to us and to those left behind . " Barrier on Starboard Bow . " No sooner had we reached the deck than Sverre Strom , the boatswain , who was in the crow 's . nest , called down , " Barrier on the starlioard bow ! " A great cheer went up , the releasing of all the pent-up emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their energies to this goal . It has been their dream and their ambition , the purpose to which they have dedicated two years of their life , and the word that it was actually in sight acted like an electric stimulus . Faces glowed and , words . tumbled out fast . Tomorrow we may be ashore in ' Discovery Inlet , our feet for the first time on that mystic land which has so drawn men that they have laid down their lives to learn something ' of its secrets . A Milestone Reached . It is as much a milestone as the first flight will be and that we should have reached it on Christmas Day , . a day of thanksgiving and dedication to the greatest ideals of men , ' is a source of thanksgiving and happiness to all ' on board . And not the , least of all our causes for celebration is that ' this day we have carried the American flag further south than it ' has ever been before and have taken with us to that point an . American airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that plane may be winging its way over the snowy wilderness of the barrier . . Commander Byrd 's Message . Commander Byrd expressed this feeling today when , in a message to the Secretary of the Navy , he said : We have reached today the great mysterious ' ice barrier . ' It presents to us an ice cliff higher than ? the masts of the ship . On this Christmas Day we are thankful and proud to report that - we have been able to carry the American flag several ' hundred miles further south than it ? has ever been , and it seems fitting that an airplane , that instrument of good-will , should reach its furthest south on Christmas Day . We are 2,400 statute miles from the nearest human dwelling , in the only area in the world where a ship can get se far from civilization . That we are here safely is due to Providence and my loyal and stout-hearted shipmates , who have worked together unselfishly as a unit . It will probably be some days before we get ashore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay of Whales . BYRD . Hear Words From Home . Not the least wonderful of all the happenings of this evening is that we are approaching the barrier , only a few miles away now , as we are listening on deck to broadcasting from home , and one can not listen to those metallic tones coming from the loud-speaker without realizing the tremendous progress made by man in science since the last Antarctic adventure . It is weird and almost ghostly to hear words from home coming to us as we move through these ice-filled waters to our base . And comforting , too , for we know that we have not wholly lost touch with the world , so very far away . We are trying on skiis tonight on deck , making ready for our first run ashore , and there is the great expectancy of new things , of meeting at last the tremendous ice field on which our homes will be for fourteen months , of glimpsing some of the beauty and stark loneliness of Antarctica . This has been a greet Christmas Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been written for what it is worth , and there is not a man aboard who is not in his heart determining that it shall be a worthy one .
