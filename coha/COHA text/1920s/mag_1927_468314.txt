WE ARE accustomed to startling changes in many of our sciences , with the quantum theory in physics upsetting the laws of thought , the Einstein theory measuring our previously infinite universe , the star Betelgeuse proving to be 50,000,000 times as large as our sun , and behaviorism making machines of people who used to have souls and were immortal . We are accustomed to revelations and reversals of previous belief in all of our sciences except one . We feel that we are through with geography when we are through with the seventh grade in school . And yet there is no science in which profounder changes are taking place . There is more need for a new geographic world-outlook now than there ever has been since Magellan 's three impudent ships sailed into the west , to test a theory of the scientists , and came back from the East with the news that the world was round . There was theory back of Magellan as there is theory back of the men who are changing the geographic outlook of our own time . Democritus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was round . Eratosthenes , two hundred years before Christ , measured the earth by measuring three things in Egypt , the height of the noonday sun at Assuan , the height of it at Alexandria , and the distance between the two cities counted in parasangs . Then he made his computation and found a circumference for the earth which agrees with our latest measurements within five per cent of error . So it is not correct to say , as careless talkers and careless books still do , that Magellan discovered the roundness of the earth . It was not even a rediscovery , for the Greek learning had never disappeared completely during the centuries between Eratosthenes and Columbus . Columbus set out on the theory that the world was round , and so did Magellan . These two were great , nevertheless ; for the busy men who control governments and commerce are skeptical of deductions even from facts which they themselves admit , and they are too busy to go deep into reasoning . But they will believe testimony and they will act on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made them great . They forced men to think , and in that sense they were leaders of thought . No more than Columbus or Magellan , have the pioneers of to-day been the originators of the ideas which underlie their work . They , too , have gone to the theorists for their inspiration , and it is more difficult now than formerly to say just who those theorists were . We speak with a certain confidence of Democritus and what he originated , for the names of the thinkers who preceded him are mostly lost . But in our day you no sooner claim for someone priority of intellectual discovery than a student in some musty library digs up an earlier reference . There is , then , little profit in disputing about modern priorities Omitting any such attempt , we can trace the parallel between Magellan 's age and our own in terms similar for both . And we must trace that parallel , or we can not well understand the change of thought in our time , or the necessity for it . The ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrable to scientists for nearly two thousand years . But the public of Shakespeare 's day learned them from none of the theorists , but from the story-tellers who chronicled the dramatic voyages of the explorers , and especially the doings of popular heroes like Sir Francis Drake . The same is true to-day , although the adventures of the Elizabethan age centered around sailors and sailing while ours deal with flyers and flying . The revolutionary geographic ideas of the present , then , are connected with flying , but not in a way that has as yet crept much into the newspapers or popular books . The tales , certainly , have been fully told in print . But a true story is not always clearly understood or its meaning impressed on the general consciousness the moment it has been related and circulated . There was almost as much excitement in Europe , and more in England , when Drake sailed around the world than there had been when Magellan did it half a century before . There was almost as much excitement in Europe , and more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Alcock and Brown did it eight years before . For the English did not really understand that all the oceans which lie west and east of England could be navigated till their own Drake did it , and we did not fully realize that the Atlantic would some day become crossable at will by flyers until our own Lindbergh did it . But it is not the crossings of the Atlantic as such , nor the crossings of the Pacific to Hawaii , and to China in the near future , that make necessary a readjustment of world-outlook in any way resembling the post-Magellian . It will result , instead , from a study comparing ocean flights in the Temperate Zone with those in the Tropics and in the Arctic . Most easily and dramatically the moral can be read from the story of Byrd 's two great flights , to the North Pole and to France . In accord with that lesson and others like it we must revise our common ideas of the zones almost as fundamentally as Europe once had to change its mind about the flatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward intellectually but also at a disadvantage practically , as England would have been then had she failed to realize , that there were two roads to China , one east and the other west . II Why we need to change our minds about the comparative character of the two zones is hard to understand unless we reflect on how our forefathers gathered the ideas which the schools have passed down to us about the two zones north and south of us , in which only a few of us have ever been and in which almost none of us were educated . Our ideas about the tropics and the Arctic , like much of the rest of our mental furniture , came from the classic Greeks , who were , with some brilliant exceptions , strong on logic but weak on facts . The philosophers between Democritus and Eratosthenes built up a system of geography according to which there were five zones on the earth , three of which they considered they knew by observation , and two of which they deduced from theory . The North Temperate Zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but too warm for comfort on its southern edge and too cold on the northern . As you proceeded south you would first come to a region where the heat would not be willingly endured by any sensible man ; beyond that lay another belt where " by reason of the flames of the sun , which is too near " the land would be literally burning hot and the ocean boiling . Correspondingly , as you travelled north from the Temperate Zone you came first to a region where the cold would not be willingly endured ; beyond that , " by reason of the absence of warmth because the sun is too far away , " everything would be frozen solid forever . It is still easy for us to believe that the Greeks may have had such ideas about the Arctic , for some of us got very similar ones in school no more than twenty years ago . But that they could have believed in a boiling ocean ? or at least one so hot that no life could exist ? seems strange now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poems to the publicity for Coral Gables . But it is only four centuries and a half since everybody in Europe actually believed it . One of the fine works of recent scholarship is J. K. ' Wright 's Geographical Lore of the ' Time of the Crusades , published by the American Geographical Society of New York , which shows that throughout the Middle Ages a few scholars in every generation believed that the world was spherical and could be circumnavigated east and west , if no land barred the way , and if you kept within the limits of the Temperate Zone . But these same scholars still agreed with the Greeks that while there doubtless existed a South Temperate and a South Frigid Zone we should never know them except by inference , for no one could ever cross the superheated tropics to get to them . It was that royal Portuguese soldier , Prince Henry the Navigator , who , so far as we yet know , most deserves the credit for abolishing the boiling tropics . He , rather than Magellan or Columbus , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with true scientific skepticism he went against Greek science as then understood , and the Bible as then interpreted . He seems to have been a religious man , and yet his attitude toward the priest , as well as the philosopher , was that it was neither folly nor sacrilege to test by experiment whether the scientists had been right in their deductions and whether Scripture had been truly interpreted . So he disregarded alike the theologians who said that the earth was flat and the scientists who said that it was round but with a boiling middle , and sent ship after ship along the west coast of Africa from Portugal . Many returned with reports of fearsomely increasing heat as they went south , and one had even seen the flames of Hell peeping up over the edge of the earth . But at last one ship penetrated to where the sun was directly above the masthead at noon . The sails did not catch fire nor were the sailors cooked alive on the decks , and the ocean itself was only comfortably warm for swimming . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Da Gama to sail around the tip of Africa and reach the Indies from the west a few years before Columbus tried to reach them going in the opposite direction . So disappeared the earth 's flaming girdle , and the logicians of the day at once jumped to the conclusion that the region of frozen death in the north would prove just as imaginary , if somebody would only go and look . There was reason for going , for the shortest distance over a round world to China is north from northwestern Europe and this , if it were navigable water , would be the best highway to the wealth of the Indies . But the ice floating on the ocean barred the way of a chronically hopeful age which simply refused to believe that there could be a permanent barrier across the road to its desires . If they could not sail straight north to the riches of the East they would find a way around the north end of either Asia or America . Thus began three centuries of commercial search for these passages which came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paid for it with the lives of himself and every one of his more than a hundred comrades . That tragedy shocked the world into a realization that ocean commerce had little to gain by finding long and tortuous passages that would never develop into safe and easy highways for trading ships . Thus , because the wish is father to the thought , the Frozen North of the Greeks had disappeared completely from men 's minds in the enthusiasm following Da Gama , Columbus , and Magellan , to be replaced gradually by a theory which for three centuries sent far more men sailing north than ever came back . The survivors , however , being commercial pioneers , told not only stories of hardship but also tales of friendly countries here and there with a climate not resembling that in the theories of the Greeks . Davis , after whom the straits are named , said that he had been north " three diverse times " and that he had found the summer climate far within the Arctic " as salubrious as ever I did in the Isles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe only a few of the ancient ideas that have not yet been removed either by modern science or modern propaganda . We cling especially to the belief that the tropics have the greatest average heat , which is correct , and that they have the most extreme heat , which is false . Even Californians seem to believe that the highest temperature records occur in the tropics , though Death Valley , in their own state , has the highest record on earth , 136 ? in the shade . About the Arctic we still believe more than half of what the Greeks believed , and the less pleasant half , at that . We take no stock in the charming land of the Hyperboreans , where people hop about on one leg and trees bear golden fruit . But we still think that there is permanent ice , and no life at all , on land which actually did not have ice on it in the ice age and never has had since , but grass and grazing animals then as now . If this is to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change our minds about the comparative character of the three zones of the northern half of the world , in which most of humanity lives , as it was for the commercial nations of Magellan 's time to get firmly into their minds the idea that , superficial appearances and popular belief to the contrary , the world was round . It is thrilling to look at heroes , but more important is the drawing of every lesson from the deeds we admire . This is easy to do from the flights of Commander Byrd , for there we have the same man in the same kind of airplane flying the most familiar part of the Atlantic and also the little understood Arctic . A year and a half ago , when Byrd and Bennett were about to try flying to the North Pole , almost anybody except a thorough student of both general meteorology and the Arctic would have pictured terrors of cold , fog , gale , snow , and blizzard , with the flyers numb and with ice forming on their plane to weigh it down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sun is so low in the Arctic and the compass works badly near the North Pole ( most people seem to have a feeling that the North Pole has some effect on the compass , though they no longer believe that it is what the compass points to ) . It would be difficult to take off from Spitsbergen , difficult to locate even the approximate vicinity of the North Pole , and difficult to find one 's way back . All these troubles would have been thought to be greater than those encountered in similar distances over the Atlantic or elsewhere in the Temperate Zone . It would , too , be very dangerous to land anywhere on the frozen sea , and almost impossible to get back to shore if your plane could not take off again . As to the difficulty of landing and taking off , Byrd 's adventure gave no clew , for he did not come down . But you read plain the answers to all the rest of the objections in the story as he told it in the New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of the Arctic Sea north of Spitsbergen as you do of the Atlantic east of Newfoundland , for there is no sprinkling of ships to report by wireless . You have to take a chance on the weather , a terrible hazard if you believe in the frequency and violence of Arctic gales . So Byrd and Bennett took that chance . All they knew was that the weather looked good around Spitsbergen and that the best long distance guess of the meteorologists was that it was good also on the sea to the north . The season was the late Arctic winter . The sky was clear , the wind light , and no fog or clouds interfered with navigation . They flew to the North Pole ( almost the same distance as if they had flown from Newfoundland half way to Ireland ) , circled it , and flew back faultlessly ? without any landmark to guide them and therefore wholly dependent on the arts of navigation ? struck the right headland of Spitsbergen as accurately as a Southhampton liner making Sandy Hook , and landed without accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer than the coldest temperature recorded for New York City . None of the other bogeys materialized ? which might all have been luck , though extraordinary luck if the Arctic were as bad as supposed . We shall come back to that point later . The thrill seekers were disappointed at Byrd 's North Pole story ; where nothing goes wrong , there is nothing hair-raising to tell . They were not similarly disappointed a year later in his New York to Paris adventure , for plenty went wrong over the much-travelled Atlantic and over familiar France ? nothing wrong with the machine or the admirable crew , but hardly anything right with the weather . The natural disadvantages of the north Atlantic stand out the more clearly when you remember that there was every human advantage . Both the North Pole plane and the Atlantic were Fokkers , but the Atlantic plane was presumably the better , for there had been steady progress in every branch of aviation during the year . The splendid Wright engines were said to have been improved . Byrd was more experienced , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not with him , through a deplorable accident , his place was adequately filled by Acosta , Balchen , and Noville . He did not have to take a chance on the weather , for dozens of ships at sea and the weather bureaus on both shores of the Atlantic co-operated in keeping him posted . But the good old Atlantic weather was abroad , and delayed the start , first for days and then for weeks . Finally the conditions were announced satisfactory and Byrd was handed a weather map to show him how to steer and where to fly high or low to get the most advantage from the plotted winds . The leg of the flight from New York to the Atlantic side of Newfoundland can be considered as preliminary , for it is above well-known lands . The weather , too , could be relied on for this stretch , for the weather bureau of to-day does not make many mistakes about territory so near at hand during the first few hours after a prediction is issued . The real trial came between Newfoundland and Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a year before from King 's Bay to the North Pole and back . The story of the two flights , as told by Byrd himself , is very different as to the flying conditions . The comparison is conclusive enough from these few quotations about the Atlantic flight : We had rain , wind , and fogs all the way across the ocean . We could not get out of the fog . Up we went , but there we found fog , too . Most of the time we flew at 10,000 feet . ( July 2 , 1927. ) .. in these nineteen hours between Newfoundland and France . .. we saw neither water nor land and seldom even the sky . ( July 3. ) ? . all the way we had only very occasional glimpses of the sun and sometimes in the fog we could barely see the wing-tips of the plane . ( July 3 . ) . . . Once ice formed on our motors and we were , of course , worried as to the effect it might have on our propellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had in the Arctic , nor did Amundsen have it crossing the Arctic till he came near the Temperate Zone . Most of the Norge 's trouble of that sort was in the Temperate Zone . The man who had never been at fault in sixteen hours of Arctic flying says about the navigation troubles between Newfoundland and the end of his flight in France : During the last six hours of our flight the earth induction compass , for some unknown reason , was thrown out of position and before we knew it we had swung in a half circle out of our course and , to state it frankly , we were lost . Once before during the day we had become much alarmed , for we had drifted further south than we expected , and it was only by asking with our radio what our position was that we were able to .. shape our course . And in conclusion he says , in his despatch of July 6 : " Fog still remains aviation 's greatest enemy . " If it strikes you , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil chance , then review the other flights . Lindbergh , who all agree had exceptionally fine weather for that route , reported that after flying several hours in thick fog he considered turning back . Chamberlin and Levine had more fog than Lindbergh , and the British dirigible that crossed by Newfoundland , even at the best time of the year for that route , had considerable . Byrd reminds us : When Aleock and Brown made their first great daring jump from Newfoundland to Ireland they flew in a fog a great deal of the way and never knew on which side they were flying . For many minutes they were flying upside down . But more convincing than the reports of all the flyers , for they are as yet few , is the uniform testimony of seamen that the north Atlantic has been consistently foggy for the last four hundred years . To determine if Byrd had luck in the Arctic , take first Lincoln Ellsworth 's description of the weather on the Amundsen-Ellsworth flight of 1925 and on the **25;741;TOOLONG flight in the airship Norge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second across the full diameter of the Arctic , by way both of the North Pole and that other spot four hundred miles on the Alaska side of the North Pole which has been named the Pole of Inaccessibility because it is the center of the floating Arctic sea ice and therefore much harder than the North Pole to reach either by walking or flying . There were two things that greatly impressed me during our long sojourn near the North Pole ! i.e. , 25 days at Lat. 87 ? 44 ' in 1024 The first was the stability of the meteorological conditions in this isolated area ? the winds blowing from the same direction day after day , with a velocity just sufficient to keep our Norwegian flag fully extended . Two hours after leaving Kings Bay Spitsbergen on the 19V flight we found ourselves over the pack-ice . What weather ! The sun shone brilliantly out of a sky of pure turquoise , and the whale-like shadow that our airship cast beneath us trailed monotonously across a glittering snowfield . .. . As we approached latitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepening blue of the southern sky . . . . Intermittent light fogs hid the ice from our view ( later ) rolling beneath us like a great woolen ocean . Approaching 88 ? we had to rise from 1,800 feet to more than 3,000 to get over them . ( Yale Review , July , 1927 . ) Arctic fogs are , on the average , lower than Atlantic fogs . Byrd says he flew at 10,000 feet most of the way across the Atlantic and still had so much fog above him that he seldom saw the sun or the sky , but Ellsworth tells of clearing the Arctic fogs at a height of 3,000 feet . He continues : " By midnight the fog had completely cleared away and there was no wind . " The inference from his further narrative is that these weather conditions held . At the North Pole it was clear ; at the Pole of Inaccessibility , four hundred miles on the Alaska side of the North Pole and half way from Spits- Bergen to Alaska , the air must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the ship . You can not see clean tracks in white snow from a travelling airship unless the weather is fairly clear . Then , As we approached the Alaska coast , fears assailed us ; for there we ran into the only storm during our entire voyage ? fog , wind and sleet ? and for thirty-one hours we battled . Most of that battle was on the very edge of the Arctic and after they entered the Temperate Zone . The area of fog and sleet and bad flying weather moves north from the Temperate Zone to overlap the edge of the Arctic in the late spring period which Ellsworth is describing . In midsummer it covers the whole Arctic , which is then as foggy as the worst parts of the Temperate Zone , only the fogs are lower and easier to fly over so you can at least have the sun to navigate by even if you can not see the ground below . But , as in the case with the Atlantic , more convincing than the testimony of a few flyers is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it when he said , at the end of three years ' drifting across the Arctic basin with the ship Fram embedded in the floating ice , that the Arctic was as to weather the most placid large area in the world . The rest of the story is that it is never as cold one thousand feet above the Arctic sea-ice as it sometimes is in certain towns in the United States . Six or seven months of the Arctic winter are almost as free of fogs as the Sahara . And even in the short foggy season of summer the fogs average low . It is not uncommon that two Arctic whaling captains can see each other clearly in shimmering sunshine as they stand in their crow 's nests a hundred feet up , while the men on the decks can barely locate the sun as a blur and can not see the other ship at all . Remembering Byrd 's dictum that " The fog remains the chief enemy of aviation , " we see readily that the tropics and sub-tropics must be better , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are known to be less foggy . The papers are already saying that the route to London from New York will not be by way of Newfoundland and the North Atlantic , but subtropical via Bermuda and the Azores . That is an increase in distance , but even at a loss of time and fuel it will be well worth while because of increased safety and certainty . The Arctic ranks at least as high above the North Atlantic for flying as do the tropics , and an Arctic route between points in the North Temperate Zone that are far apart will usually save fuel and time . Cold , as such , is no handicap to airplanes , for passengers and pilots will be in compartments heated from the exhaust . Cold will be a great advantage for airships , for the lifting power of the gas bag increases when the temperature of the air drops . But there remains the problem of landing places , over which the authorities have disagreed till recently . Before citing the striking testimony that has just come to hand , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far wider than the Arctic , and in that sense more difficult to " hop over . " The Pacific is wider still . Furthermore , there are more islands in the Arctic than in any other ocean , and these will eventually be used as way stations . But it has been said not only by laymen but also by some of the professionals , that landing places for flying boats , such as Amundsen-Ellsworth used in 1925 , are rare in winter ( which is admitted ) , and that planes with wheels or skids can land only with practically suicidal danger . Amundsen describes , for instance , on pages 138 and 139 of The First Crossing of the Polar Sea , what he saw in looking down from a dirigible and emphasizes the conclusions he had reached in his flying boat the previous year : The ice conditions seemed exactly the same now as in 1925 . We did not see a single landing place on the long way from Svalbard Spitsbergen to Alaska . .. . In spite of Byrd 's fine flight our advice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become so perfect that one can be quite sure of not having to make a forced landing . These conclusions as to the moving winter pack-ice of the Polar Sea were based by Amundsen solely on what he had seen from aloft , for his one landing had been with a boat in a lead , and he had never been on winter pack-ice on any of his previous expeditions . Byrd , who also had never been afoot on winter pack-icc , judged wholly from looking down while flying , and he was inclined to take a position somewhat nearer Amundsen 's pessimistic opinion than the optimistic view of Wilkins , who maintained that there would seldom be five miles on the winter pack without a reasonably safe landing with good visibility conditions . In other words , if you were flying high when your engine stopped you could usually glide to a safe landing . This view Wilkins based on extensive flying experience both in peace and war and on the knowledge of winter pack-ice which he had gained in three years , 1913-16 , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since frequency of landing places is one of the chief demands of heavier-than-air flying , the difference in opinion between Amundsen and Wilkins was crucial . If Amundsen were right , the Arctic , despite favorable air conditions , would be a dangerous place for airplanes ; if Wilkins were right , it would be the safest region in the world for the com mercial use of the flying-machine . Iv I pause here a moment , before introducing the dramatic story of Wilkins ' Arctic flights , to answer a question I am constantly asked . " Why should anybody want to fly across the Arctic ? " The reply is the same as for the Atlantic or the Pacific : in order to get to the other side . It is nothing but mental habit that makes one think of the permanent flying route from New York to Peking as lying either west by land plane to Chicago and Seattle and then by seaplane over the wide Pacific roughly following the steamer route along the south of the Aleutian chain ; or else east via Newfoundland , Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western route is had , for you have to cross those mountains which up till now compel a break in the transcontinental air mail between Pasco and Seattle ; overseas it is worse , for the Pacific just south of the Aleutians is about the foggiest ocean in the world , and the land edge bounding it on the north is the foggiest of all land regions . Eastward it is bad to Paris , though good thereafter . And both east and west routes are twice as long as necessary . You should fly north , to save half the distance , to avoid land fogs , mountains , sea fogs and wide jumps over water . That airway runs from New York over Montreal , thence north over the flat land west of Hudson Bay , across the Arctic Sea where it is narrow and studded with islands , and across the mountainless lowland of eastern Siberia and China , arriving in Peking from the north . And so with many other routes and many important cities that lie comparatively near to each other across the Arctic , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first the trans-Arctic routes will doubtless be flown by airship , chiefly , for they can already reach Peking from New York easily without landing , and there will soon be others built that can make the round trip without taking supplies . But providing short-jump air stations for planes on the direct route would not be difficult so far as freight transportation is concerned . With a globe before you , put a dot on every place you think there should be a relay ( say every five hundred miles ) ; you can arrange in New York with a common carrier which will take goods or fuel to every one of your dots for a regular freight tariff already in force . To be sure , if you go straight there will be one over-sea jump that is more than five hundred miles , though not half as long as the one from Newfoundland to Ireland ; but by keeping a little to your left you would be over land all the way except for a jump across Bering Straits corresponding to the hop from London to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions throughout the trip in any season of the year except , again , for the narrow Bering Straits . The mathematically direct route would be a winter route only . And now to the story of the Wilkins flights which throw light on the one question which remains in dispute , whether the Arctic deep sea pack-ice is specially dangerous to fly over because of few landing places , or comparatively safe because of many . As a preliminary to their deep sea work in 1926 , Wilkins and his pilot Eielson of the Detroit Arctic Expedition flew more than 4,000 miles back and forth between Fairbanks in Alaska , just south of the Arctic Circle , and Barrow , which is about three hundred miles within the Arctic , crossing five times in winter and spring a range of mountains one hundred miles wide with peaks 10,000 feet high . Landing places were numerous on rivers and lakes , except in these mountains , and they utilized some of them . The air in winter was the smoothest in which they had ever flown , not a bump or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be made for five crossings of 10,000-foot mountains in the Tropical or Temperate Zones . ) They also made a three hundred mile reconnaissance over deep sea pack-ice and came back of the opinion , as they had been before , that landing places for wheels or skids were numerous . But in 1026 they proved nothing in this regard , for they did not come down except on land , or river ice , or on sea lagoon ice . The critical flight which gave us all the experimental knowledge we as yet have about the safety of landing on the polar pack was made when the fickle daily press had turned from the Arctic flying of 1926 to the Atlantic flying of 1927 . We tell its story here more fully than any of the preceding , for unless you read the Detroit News , which financed the expedition , you have never heard , perhaps , that there was such a flight ? or unless , again , you read Science , in which Commander Richard E. Byrd and I published a jointly written statement calling attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arctic expeditions , then being strangely neglected . On March 29 , 1927 , Wilkins and Eielson , in a land plane mounted on skids and with gas for fourteen hours , started from Barrow , Alaska , three hundred miles north of the Arctic circle , on an intender triangular exploration flight of six hundred miles somewhat north of west , two hundred miles southwest , and then back to Barrow . They flew steadily for more than five hours , about five hundred and fifty miles . , and Eielson made a perfect landing . While Eielson worked on the engine , Wilkins made two holes in the ice for the use of the sonic depth finder . The ice was three feet thick and the water beneath it proved to be about three miles deep . During the flight the weather , fair at the start , had begun to turn cloudy , and a wind was increasing , blowing off the land . For winds do blow in the Arctic , though not so often as in the Temperate Zone , nor so violently on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in taking off , Wilkins decided to head straight back to shore . The trip was already fruitful . They had flown three hundred miles beyond the limit of previous exploration , had disproved the view of those who believed land existed within five hundred miles northwest of Barrow , and had proved the ocean so deep that the probability of land even far off in that direction is greatly lessened . And they had made one safe landing on the pack with skids ? an accomplishment of value in the face of the controversy , for at least you can not say that no landing can be made after one has been made . The take-off proved as safe and easy as the landing , and they flew straight back over their course , but with diminished speed , for the force of the head wind was increasing and the engine was not working well . In about ten minutes it got so bad that they had to come down . Again Wilkins picked what he thought was a safe spot , and again Eielson made a perfect landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the repairs , for the day was getting short , the wind had increased to a blizzard , and clouds had hidden the sun . The new-fallen snow , too , was a little soft and they had to make five attempts before the plane finally took the air . This used up precious daylight and more precious fuel , so that when finally under way Wilkins calculated that light would fail them two hundred miles , and the gasoline probably one hundred miles , before reaching shore . He consulted Eielson . Should they make a safe landing in daylight or fly through the dark till the gas gave out , on the chance that it might after all last them back to land ? Their calculations as to distance were very uncertain , as they did not know the force of the wind and how much it was delaying them . If the wind dropped , they might make land . Eielson voted for taking that chance . Night was on , and they had been flying for two hours without seeing the ice below , the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon in the sky above , when suddenly the engine stopped . Their fuel was all gone . Only from his instruments could Eielson judge how far below them was the ice . Through the dark of night and the murk of the blizzard they came to a third landing . Their machine stayed right side up , but a snag of ice broke one of the wings . Then , in the thick of the blizzard , Wilkins and Eielson got out their bedding and slept the night in fair comfort . We in civilized countries fear the Arctic which we do not know , and think indifferently of the Atlantic and the southerly oceans , for we know them . But do we really know them to be anything except merciless , especially in a storm ? On what sea but the Arctic could you make two safe landings , repair your machinery , take off again twice , fly till your fuel is gone , and then land , go to bed , and sleep the night dry and comfortable a hundred miles from the nearest land ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a travelling outfit , as Wilkins and Eielson did , and then walk ten miles a day for ten days , as they did , to a safe landing at a calculated spot ? On no other sea could you do it , except possibly the Antarctic . That is the burden of this tale . If ours is to be an age of commercial flying , or if the military men of the various nations are to apprehend correctly the danger of air attack from the north , we must get over the idea that the Arctic is a barrier . And we must took at our globes often enough to get instead the idea that the Temperate Zone , with all its great cities , lies curved in a circle around a central patch which is the Arctic .
