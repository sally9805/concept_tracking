It was a dull week for the President . At press conference on Tuesday he had next to nothing to say . This seemed too bad in view of the fact that there was present an unusual number of foreign correspondents , especially British-arrived in Washington to watch what Congress does about the Kellogg Treaty and the cruiser-building bill , and to get background for the inauguration of the Hoover regime . President Coolidge took the opportunity to explain to the foreigners that the reason he has the U. S. embassies abroad hand out copies of his speeches-such as the Armistice Day announcement about naval construction , foreign debts and the U. S. share in the War-is to avoid misinterpretation , not ( as suspected abroad ) to impress foreign governments . <P> Thinking of nothing much else to say , the President turned to Secretary Everett Sanders . What could he suggest ? Secretary Sanders murmured something about the Last Message to Congress . Ah , yes . President Coolidge stated that he was working on a message to Congress , that he expected to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Coolidge went to an Army dispensary and prudently checked on his health by having his teeth Xrayed . The presidential teeth are in excellent condition , announced Presidential Physician James F. Coupal . <P> Having received the diplomatic corps ( TIME , Nov. 26 ) and met all newcomers , the President &; Mrs. Coolidge last week dined the diplomatic corps-92 covers , 49 nations represented , music by Tenor Arthur Hackett and Harpist Alberto Salvi . <P> The press of the U. S. discovered , to its admiration and amusement , that President &; Mrs. Coolidge had made a Sunday morning motor trip to Bull Run battlefield in Virginia , returning for a 2 p. m. lunch at the White House . The matter went unreported for 24 hours-a record in the Coolidge administration . <P> President Coolidge appointed John W. Pole of Cleveland to be Comptroller of the Currency , vice Joseph W. Mclntosh resigned . Duties of the Comptroller of the Currency are to supervise application of the banking laws , study reports from U. S. bank examiners . All national banks must report to him periodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Mrs. Coolidge , at Hoover Field , christened a big airplane Christopher Columbus . If she noticed that it was a Ford plane , she said nothing . It was supposed to have been a Fokker plane , the first of the Pan-American Airways Transport system , soon to open routes from Miami to Nassau , Havana , Camagey ( Cuba ) , San Juan , P. R. and , later , Mexico , Central and South America . The Fokker ship meant to have been christened Christopher Columbus had been cracked up the day before . The substitute Ford was leased for one day . <P> Fourteen Senators and a Senator-elect-all Republicans-breakfasted at the White House . They went away digesting sausages , fried eggs , buckwheat cakes and the impression that President Coolidge wants to get the U. S. into the World Court as a crowning event of the Coolidge Era.
