Like all its inhabitants and all its swift and luminous companions , this earth must discover an eventual disaster . How the disaster will arrive , and when , is a matter for astronomers to ponder . Dr. James Hopwood Jeans , famed British astronomer , Secretary of the Royal Society , pondered ; last week , in London , he spoke sadly of the dwindling universe . Said he : <P> " The sun is undoubtedly wasting away as it radiates energy . " For each square inch of the sun 's surface , it radiates enough energy to keep a fifty-horsepower engine going . This goes on century after century . <P> " This radiation of energy and matter makes all the stars poorer ; but it is a kind of capital levy . It is graduated sharply , so those stars which are best able to bear the burden radiate the most and tend to become equal.to the poorer ones . . . . <P> " A million million years from now the sun will still be much the same as now , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a little longer and the climate quite a lot colder , while the rich accumulated stores of coal , oil and forests will be long since burned up . <P> " Nevertheless , that is no reason why our descendants should not exist . Perhaps the earth will be unable to support quite so many people as now , perhaps fewer will want to live on it . Mankind , three million times as old , may be three million times as wise . " <P> Dr. Jeans was not the only astronomer who , last week , was engaged in somewhat mundane speculations . Dr. Paul Renno Heyl , a physicist attached to the U. S. Bureau of Standards , began his second series of experiments to determine the world 's weight . Last year he estimated this to be **29;12512;TOOLONG tons . Now , by making a slight change in his apparatus , * Astronomer Heyl expects to achieve a slight but consequential difference in his result . <P> <P> * Last year he used two steel cylinders , equipped with small platinum balls , pendent in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the earth 's pull as a constant , he could discover a unit in which to compute the earth 's attraction . This time his steel cylinders are equipped with small glass balls .
