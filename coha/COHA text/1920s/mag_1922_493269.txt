December 27 , 1922 THE NEW Mind what she has said , so that when he rises in the morning , and goes tardy to his pad and pencil , there is not a syllable left of what she came so far to tell . And she never comes again with that particular message . When he finds that blank in his ' Hind , he wonders what she and her followers would have told him ? perhaps the very best news of all . If she signals him in the street , it is a sign in- be withdrawn , for she permits no mortals to be present to spy on her when she brings tidings . He knows then that he must search hastily for shelter , wherever he is ? sometimes the deserted Corner of a railway waiting-room or a quiet table at a restaurant . If she sees him obedient and doing his best to find cover and privacy , she will delay . A few times she has made her visit in he bright day and out of doors , but only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he could seize an envelope and lay it on his knee as he sat on fence or doorstep . He must let her sec that he is humbly ready , and that plainly there is no indoor retreat to be had . After he has done his best and begun to copy out her words , some- times a worldling comes , She vanishes . But she may return , if he has been short with the intruder and turned him away at once . For she understands just the measure of his welcome to her . She and her companions leave him to work out what they have said , once they have seen him take it down . They are plainly sure of its importance , but careless of whether he is wise enough to make use of it . Sometimes it is aerial , like their own substantial presence . Then , long after they are gone , he must supply ballast and underpinning . Sometimes it lacks sagacity , as if it had become mingled with shreds of mist on the way . Once it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery . He wondered if they had come a long distance that evening , and grown weary in flight , and so had spoiled their tidings . Or was it just possible they had planned the jest at his expense ? He did not believe it . Their high seriousness forbade it . He learned to love them . But not for that did he gain one inch on their impersonal demeanor , their impatience to be off . Were they only messengers ? And did they carry their story from some yet lovelier being , and lose a little in the bringing , and alter a little in the telling ? Or was news their own news ? Would they ever come to stay with him ? And if they came to stay , could they always talk at ease , or did they , too , have their silences ? In early days , they came only a few times in the dreary year . While he could not , even yet , win from them signs of friendliness , one gain he did make . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devoted himself more heartily to making ready for them , knowing not in what hour they would come , and so holding all times prepared . And for doing this thing , they rewarded him by coming more often , and staying a little longer . ARTHUR GLEASON . Tante Barbara Goes Back TANTE BARBARA has spent a summer in the land of her childhood , the land she left thirty years ago , a round-eyed girl of seventeen , to come to golden America . Once that land was " Home , " but now the word is reserved for her happy , busy apartment in the Bronx , with her children and her man . Sometimes she refers to the village near Worms , in Hessen-Darmstadt as " The old home " but it is an empty phrase of respect . She will never go back again . She does n't regret her summer , even though it took her three years to save the money which is now all gone ? whoo ! in steamer fares and train fares and presents for the nieces and nephews in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . But once is enough . It is too sad to see those comrades of your youth , whom you had treasured in your heart as stripling lads and tender lasses , now old , withered , ugly men and women . It was all a surprise for her sisters and her brothers , who knew nothing of her coming . The family had stopped writing back and forth when the war made communication first difficult and then impossible . Asking no favors of anyone , Tante Barbara crossed the ocean and took train from Hamburg , and another train from Worms , and got down at her own village . Outside the station she met a woman and a little girl and asked for her sister by name . " It 's the next village , " said the woman . " I do n't know her myself , but I 've heard of her often and often . " The little girl spoke up with " I know the house , " and described it . So Tante Barbara thanked them and walked the mile to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she feared a crowd would follow her . She found the place easily enough . The door stood open and she could see the family at dinner . " Now do n't get excited , here 's Barbara back from America , " she said as she walked in . ( She was awkward at first in her use of the old speech , for thirty years is thirty years . But it soon came back to her . ) After a few broken explanations , and some tears , they were pretty calm . There was her sister and her brother and the brother 's wife whom she had never met , though she had been a member of the family for twenty-five years and had borne eight children , six living . " And that 's all there was to it , " says Tante Barbara , back in New York , sitting in the best rocker , resplendent in her traveling dress , telling the story to us admiring neighbors who have come in to hear her adventures . Did the others in the village remember her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , of course , but plenty who played with her as a child were there and glad to see her . She visited all around , five villages up and down the railway . She was a sensation in that quiet Hessen-Darmstadt backwater . The little children followed her about the streets , this wonderful person from wonderful America . They called her Daler-Tante ( Dollar Aunt ) ' . Everyone wanted to go back with her to New York , especially the young girls . Did they show no bitterness because of the war , Tante Barbara ? They spoke very sadly of the war , and so many young men dead and the others crippled , but they were not bitter . " Your President promised us a fair peace , and then you did n't help to get it , " they said . But they knew that Tante Barbara could n't help that , any more than they in Hessen-Darmstadt could help the foolish things done by that so-wicked Kaiser . So-wicked , Tante Barbara ? Do n't they want him back , or another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say that 's one good thing anyhow , that old Kaiser gone . We have a republic now , that 's better . Times are hard ? oh , terribly hard ? but that 's not the government 's fault . It is doing all it can . Wicked France is to blame for the hard times . The village hates France . Before , they used French words ? " adieu " or " achee " but now it is always " auf wiedersehen . " Next to France , they hate Siberia . Some of the boys from Hessen-Darmstadt were captured by the Russians and sent to Siberian prison camps , where their treatment was so awful that even Tante Barbara burns with second-hand indigna ? tion at the memory of it . There was a boy from her village who had his eyes gouged out , as a pun ? ishment for breaking some rule . He was shipped home at last , and when his mother saw him , she dropped dead . Well , she had a weak heart , it is true ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Tante Barbara . Who started the war ? That old Kaiser , say most of the villagers . There is no monarchical sentiment in Hessen-Darmstadt , that Tante Barbara could see . The only defenders of the Kaiser , she was told , are the German-Americans who came to the United States before the war and now write back reproaching their kinsfolk for their republicanism . Most of the hatred of France is due to the acts of French troops in the occupied territory , and especially the colored troops , says Tante Barbara . She has seen the little mulatto babies playing in the streets , the children of German girls violated by Negro soldiers . How many babies , Tante Barbara ? Well , not many ; a few . But she has heard , too of innumerable affronts put upon the people . There was the owner of a factory , the richest man in his village . He had such a beautiful home , grounds , gardens . They threw him out of his house when the troops first came , leaving him to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have never given it back to him . Do they not pay him for the house ? Tante Barbara does not know , but even if they do , it is his home . It is hard , when your home is taken away . Yes , but Tante Barbara , think of the home the German army took away , or destroyed altogether , in France and Belgium . Think of the Belgium atrocities . That 's true , says Tante Barbara , who is a good American with Liberty Bonds , and a Hoover food card still hanging in her kitchen . But those atrocities now ? her village in Hessen-Darmstadt does n't believe they were committed . " You knit us Germans , " says her nephew , who fight through the war as a private . " A German wouldn ? t do such things . " The whole village echoes him . And certainly , the village is paying for the O You ca n't think how hard they work , says Tante Barbara . Every able-bodied man and woman goes into Worms on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . They come home on the train again , and drink a cup of malt coffee , and then go out into the fields and work until it is too dark to see . In summer , that means another eight hours ' labor . The village is surrounded by farms but there is not food enough for the people . When Tante Barbara walked in on her family , they were having chief meal of the day ? potatoes in their jackets and clabbered milk . The whole village lives mostly on soup , with wine and beer . The wine is fairly good ; but they all grumble about the beer . Her sister makes soup from potato peelings , or bread crusts , or anything at all For a family of ten she buys one-half a pound of meat a week . That ? s not enough , says Tante Barbara who serves steak or roast or chops every night for her family 's suppper in the Bronx . Her sister is well-to-do , she has a cow . The authorities compel her , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price to the milk station where it is distributed to poor people with children . This is not a charity ? the poor pay for their milk , and are glad to have the chance . Tante Barbara could n't eat their bread , at first . Rye bread in America is whiter than the white bread of Hessen-Darmstadt , she says . To buy at all , you must have a bread card from the government , and it only allows you about one-half as much as you need , with the children and all . I kept making mistakes about the ages of my little nieces and nephews , says Tante Barbara . A child of six or seven looks to be only four . They have bones , but there 's no flesh on them . My sister , she is younger than I am . In the old days she was the prettiest little girl in the village . Now she looks a hundred years old , all wrinkled and shriveled up . Well , I 'm no spring chicken myself , laughs Tante Barbara who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does n't at all look as though she were approaching fifty . What does the village do to amuse itself ? Not much of anything . There are no automobiles save among the very wealthy ; you will see perhaps three or four in the course of a day . A family go to a caf ? and spend the evening listening to the music . There is a movie theatre in thevillage ? they showed the Dempsey-Carpentier fight this summer ? but the price is so high that few can afford it . When Tante Barbara was there the admission was 75 marks , and 50 marks more fat the government tax . Then they reduced the admission to 65 marks and raised the tax to 75 ? which did n't help much , she observed . One thing that she missed was American ice-cream , which is unknown . They serve water ices , but Tante Barbara found them a poor substitute . All in all , the village is a very quiet , hard-working place . Even the church bells which used to make such a clatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away during the war , and to replace them is , of course , out of the question . when Tante Barbara was there , the mark was not sinking as fast as it is now . It was worth 1,000 to the dollar , but wages lagged a long way behind the alteration in purchasing power . It takes a girl six months , employed at housework , to earn the money for a pair of shoes . And things get Worse all the time . What ? s going to be the end , Tante Barbara ? What ? s going to become of all of them ? I don ? t know , " says Tante Barbara , shaking her head . BRUCE BLIVEN . Citizen Tom MY first sight of President C ? was in the telephone booth of a railway junction . " Hello , President C ? speaking , " he said . And then a moment later a tall , broad man in a blue serge suit with heavily padded shoulders , his hair red , his features large and decisive and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the station , large , firm , like a swelling piece of civic virtue . I knew the outlines of the president 's career . He had been first a baseball player of renown , he had then en ? tered the ministry , and now after several years of service had become the president of a New England college . In this state , I had been told , his athletic piety and direct man ? hood had made him adored . There were , as might be expected nowadays , some restless and reddish students Who rebelled at President C ? ' s quality and influence ; the majority of the college body took him for their ideal . President C ? and I became acquainted not long after this first sight I had of him . We sat together on a government educational commission , a left-over from the war . He never talked easily or was able to flow into simple hu ? man connections with other men , but he frequently con ? ducted a monologue or crashed into debate . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to learn his theory of education . I am not sure that I ever understood it quite , but the gist of it , as I gathered when I stripped it of its eloquence and vigor , was this ? The purpose of education is making men . A man among men . It makes leaders of men , how ? ever , also . The ideal education develops both mind and body , mens sana in corpore sano . Men learn to mix by being at college . Nothing teaches them to mix with their fellow men so well as athletics , as clean contest . Let us never forget the noble exercise of the mind ! President C ? himself might never have been able to mingle with men if it had not been for baseball . It had saved him . College men learn to he men not so much through book learning as through their freshman experiences , the rough and tum ? ble of the dormitories . College connections are valuable in ' after-life . The purpose of education is to make of young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , for he has expanded them into many addresses , were President C ? ' s theories of education . I have a friend , or rather a friend of the family , who sent her son last year to President C ? ' s college , partly because it is well known , partly to get him into the coun ? try and out of New York . Tom , the son , by some maternal engineering , by caresses and spanks and bribes , had been got through preparatory schools , and rather miraculously past the test of college entrance requirements . That was last year . A week or two ago I met President C ? on the street ; he is naturally on another commission and had run down to New York for the meeting . We talked as we walked along Park Avenue . Finally I asked , " What about my friend Mrs. L ? ' s boy , President C ? ? He is at your college , is n't he ? " A look of disgust came over the president 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that chap ? I think I remember him ; I make an effort to keep our men individually in mind . I was gravely disappointed in the course he pur ? sued in college . You can see he is a shy boy , with some ability , the dean tells me , if he would apply himself . But he made a total failure of it . He neglected his grades . He did not know how to mix with the men . He took
