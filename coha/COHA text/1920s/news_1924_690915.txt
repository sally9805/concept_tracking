txt Relief Work in the Near East . The observance of Golden Rule Sunday for the benefit of the orphans cared for by the Near East Relief brings impressively to mind the profound Influence which this work , dealing with the growing generation , Is sure to have upon the peace and happiness of that upheaved corner of the world . Nothing in the tragic and terrible decade that we have Just Passed through is so pitiful and unjust as what it has done to the children of so many different countries . That these helpless millions should know nothing of life but hunger and cold and misery , that there should be nothing to show them that there are such things in the world as Justice and gentleness and love  --  it turns one 's heart cold to think of It ! You come In to snatch as many as you can from this terrible kind of start in life , to try to , show them that there is another kind of world from this which they know , and that it is your joy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feelings . Every child that you can rescue from the miserable plight into which the war has forced him will be just so much gain for the forces of order and peace and good-will in the world . It is a work which gets down to bedrock , lessening the amount of threat to the future which must lie In rearing these great masses of children to know nothing but bitterness and misery , starting counteracting lorees of goodness and sympathy .
