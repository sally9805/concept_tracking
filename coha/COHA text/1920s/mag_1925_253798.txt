It is a comparatively simple affair to bring a child into the world . It is another matter to bring up a child once you have him . Civilized society is more or less agreed that here Nature needs much assistance , much understanding . Child-education is as prolific a subject as any other dear to the heart of man for public theorizing , wise and otherwise . <P> Last week , one Mrs. Winifred Sackville Stoner Jr. * permitted herself to be interviewed by newspaper reporters about a book she was just completing to set forth the " unquestionably " evil influence exerted by popular nursery jingles upon infant minds . Mother Goose+ herself was the object of Mrs. Stoner 's determined attack and the reporters were told , in no uncertain tones , that : <P> Simple Simon , meeting a pieman and making a request the economic premise of which was visibly fallacious , " glorifies stupidity . " <P> Little Jack Horner , sitting in his corner and eating with his fingers , inculcates bad table-manners . <P> The spider in Little Miss Muffitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear-complexes . <P> The exciting verse-Jack be nimble , Jack be quick , Jack jump over the candlestick- " puts ideas into children 's heads . . . they might kill themselves , or at least do themselves bodily injury . " <P> The tragic verse-Tom , Tom , the Piper 's son Stole a pig and away he run . <P> The pig was eat and Tom was beat And Tom went howling down the street-is obviously " bad grammar , bad morals . " I chiefly object , " said earnest Mrs. Stoner " to teaching children such nonsense because it misrepresents life . . . . It is not only criminal to do so but it helps to make criminals of children . " Then , to show that she was not merely a destructive critic , Mrs. Stoner recited one of the numerous " jingle facts " that she has written in the hope of ousting Mother Goose : <P> <P> Every perfect person owns Just two hundred and six bones . <P> Also : <P> In 1732 <P> George Washington first said boohoo ! <P> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty Cheatham* purchased four full columns of advertising space in another newspaper . Kitty Cheatham was bound that Mrs. Stoner should not enjoy exclusive credit for the great Mother Goose expose . Kitty Cheatham wrote in her large advertisement : <P> ' ' Perhaps Mrs. Stoner does not know that this idea ... is not new , but has been radically advanced , logically analyzed and fearlessly uprooted in an illuminating children 's book entitled Greetings and a Message to the Dear Children , by Augusta E. Stetson , C.S.D. ( Doctor of Christian Science ) . ... In this lovely book , the author . . . enables a child to think intelligently , in response to the law of God , or Spirit . <P> " During her 22 years of close association with children in the Sunday School of her church , First Church of <P> Christ Scientist , New Y , ork City , Mrs. Stetson devoted her tireless efforts . . . . But to return to Mother Goose , . .. let me quote the following from Mrs. Stetson 's book : <P>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
