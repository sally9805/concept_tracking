A great " temple of art , " having been sold to a cigar store corporation , will eventually be turned into a five-and-ten-cent store . Aeolian Hall , Manhattan , bought two weeks ago by the Schulte Cigar Stores for $6,000,000 ( TIME , Aug. 11 ) , has been leased to the Woolworth Co. for a term of 63 years . Says the official announcement : <P> " The ground floor ( the present concert hall ) , which will be occupied by the Woolworth Co. , will probably represent the most important store in their large chain of approximately 1,350 five-and-ten-cent stores , including stores in England and Canada . The deal emphasizes the tremendous growth of this company , which started about 40 years ago with one small store at Lancaster , Pa . " <P> The structure will probably be retained by the Aeolian Co. until May 1 , 1929 , on which date cigarettes and cheap cutlery will oust Art from the premises . Meanwhile , five more seasons of concerts will be heard inside the 43rd Street entrance , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be sold from the 42nd Street side . Then the five-and-ten will raise its scarlet standard , and the tobacco company will begin to profit on its $6,000,000 outlay . <P> Woolworth will pay a rental of $400,000 a year for the first 21 years . A graduated rental scale has been arranged for the second and last periods . These three periods have doubtless been fixed to correspond to Beethoven 's famous " three periods , " out of respect for the composer 's shade , which undoubtedly haunts the hall . The rent for the entire 63 years will amount to the neat little sum of $27,500,000 . In addition , the tenant has agreed to pay taxes , insurance and running expenses .
