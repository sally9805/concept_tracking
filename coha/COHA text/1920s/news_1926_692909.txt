txt A series of terrific explosions caused by lightning striking a magazine at the United States Naval Ammunition Depot , Lake Denmark , N. J .. six miles north of this town , at 5 o'clock ( Daylight Skving Time ) last evening , shook the country for thirty miles around , " tore houses from their foundations , hurled automobiles off the highways and darkened the sky with twin barrages of burning debris and smoke . The loss of life can not yet be estimated accurately , but it is feared that fifty persons have been killed . ' Nearby hos.pttals are filled with injured . All roads leading to the naval reservation have been closed and military and State police guards prevent any one from approaching it , at high explosive sheila are still exploding and the fire which  --  followed the first explosion has not burned out . Seven Miles of Destruction . The flames swept the scant half-mile separating the naval depot from the Picatinny army arsenal , where shells are made for the army , and reached there at 8 o'clock last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted and civilian personnel to evacuate the place soon after the ? first explosion began to scatter shells on the arsenal grounds . All night the ' thousands of shells stored in the naval depot were exploding and spreading flames and early this morning the seven square miles , which the reservations comprise . presented a sad scene of desolation . There was not a building left standing on the naval depot grounds and only one or two near the Dover road end of the army reservation . The ground looked like a shell-swept field in France . State troopers , ' just before midnight , had circulated through nearby towns , ordering these evacuated , as the civilians used ' to evacuate the areas back of the war lines , for fear of a new explosion of the T N T stored in the army arsenal . In many of these towns the warning was superfluous , for the residents had already fled , but the authorities were fearful of the disaster which might come in the wake of another terrific explosion . Fear of T N'T Explosion . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds were stored 90,000 pounds of black powder and . 50 , - 000 pounds of TNT . This , it was feared , might explode at any moment . At 2 A. M. , ? however , the magazines were still intact and officers at the arsenal said they did not know whether they would explode . Shells from the naval depot were continually dropping throughout the arsenal grounds ? and the reason for apprehension was that one of these ' might . set off the two magazines , completing the wreck of all the ' homes anywhere near by . This fear caused the Military and poli , -a guards to extend their lines from three ' to five ' miles around the arsenal and the naval depot . Back of th .. 3 ring there Were at ' least 5,000 automobiles containing persons whose curiosity had conquered their fear and who ' were drawn by the weird scene in which the flames from the numberless burning shacks and buildings which dotted the two reservations lit up the.sky . , Soldiers and ' Marines Arrive . Just after midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers from Fort Lockwood and a medical detachment under Colonel Freeman and took charge of the army 's part of the situation . Two companies of marines from the Brooklyn Navy Yard also arrived with a detachment of troops from the Sixteenth Infantry at Governor 's Island . After inspecting the Picatinny arsenal , , General Drum said he did Cot believe the magazines there would explode . He also said that , after with the marine officers , he w ! Went that many of the marines reported missing , and some an dead , would be found to have escaped to the woods and would report today . Lieutenant Bott and two of the enlisted men on duty at the army arsenal are among those reported as missing. , They started out at 6 o'clock last night to search for casurIties and have not been seen since . Many Injured In Hospitals . The General Hospital at Dover is filled with patients , most of them civilians . and a number have been taken to the Memorial Hospital at Morristown . These patients are only those who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurts is legion . The offices of the fifteen physicians in Dover have been filled with a never ending stream of patients and the Moose and Arcanum halls here and the Elks ' home have been converted into emergency hospitals . The fact that most of the civilian employes had departed for their homes when the lightning struck the magazine undoubtedly reduced the loss of life . The naval ammunition depot is COM ? minded by Captain 0 . C , Dowling , the other officers being Lieutenant H. C. Schrader , Lieutenant Commander E. A. Brown of the Medical Corps , and Car ' : in R. H. Clark of the Marines , Te depot was manned by a force of s ' '  - -  one marines , which today was e ? ** by twenty more from the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn , who were taking a gunnery course . There were also three sailors who served as pharmacists under Lieut . Commander Brown , The depot Itself contained 200 magazines which were filled with T N T , dynamite and other high explosives , shells and torpedoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and It had been supposed that if the contents of one of them should explode the resulting fire could not spread to the others . Captain Dowling 's Story . Captain 0 . C. Dowling , who was badly injured by the first explosion , gave this account of what had occurred to a reporter for TIM net YORK Thin : a reporter for ' run NEW YORK TIMES : " I was in my quarters with Mrs. Dowling , " he mid , " when the fire alarm rang . Some one had seen a wisp of smoite curling from the roof of one of the magazines and sounded the fire call . " I jumped into my automobile , which was in front of my quarters , and drove directly to the magazine from which the smoke was issuing . The magazine was filled with TNT depth bombs . When I was within two or three hundred feet of it there came a terrific explosion which hurled me out of my car , " The exploding T N T set fire to another magazine , which set fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off some high explosive shells , and when these began to let go it meant the demolishing of practically every building on the reservation . " There was nothing we could do to tight the fire ; we cvould only run before it . " - Meets Him In Hospital . Mrs. Dowling fled out the back door of her home and ran through the woods onto the highway , where a passing automobilist took her to Dover . She did not see her husband again until late at night . when he met her at the Dover General Hospital , Private Mertholdt of the Marine Corps said the marines had just finished supper when someone saw the smoke coming from a magazine and just then the fire call sounded . The men ran to their fire stations and Mertholdt went to his , which was with the fire apparatus . The men with the apparatus were within a few hundred feet of the magazine when the explosion let go . They were all knocked down . On getting up Mertholdt said , " Every one started to hunt a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Denmark and rowed across it in a boat to safety . Two of the civilian employes , William Barris and William Skews of Wharton. a village which almost adjoins the naval depot , were at work in the power house when the first explosion occurred , Both were knocked down , but Skews was so badly hurt that Barris had to carry him through the woods to his home in Wharton . Word bent to Summerall . The first news of the explosion was telephoned to Major General Summerall , in command of the Second Corps Area at Governors Island , by a Connecticut National Guard private , C. H. Mason . Mason , with another Guardsman , was on his way in his automobile to Tobyhanna , Pa. , where his regiment was encamped . The first explosion let go when the men were near the depot . They drove along until they met a telephone lineman . Knowing that the explosion must have severed all telephone lines , Mason took the lineman into his car and drove along until they found a line where the lineman could plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded Private Bretson Nye of Fostoria , Ohio , and twelve other marines dashed out from their barracks and were caught in the second explosion . Three of the ; men were hurt . Nye with four marines and a civilian employe rushed to Lake Hopatcong and rowed across it to safety . When the first explosion occurred , Sergeant Downing of the Army , on duty at Picatinny arsenal , was hurled out of his barracks . His home is about one and one-half miles from the first of the navy magazines which let go . Downing started at once for the navy reservation and met two army officers also bound there . Threequarters of a mile from the scene of the first explosion they found a young woman unconscious in the road and recognized her as a Miss Fleming . A motorist fleeing from the explosion took her to a hospital , where her condition was found to be critical . Shells Still Bursting . At o'clock , five haute after the expo On , the conditions were still auCh that search for bodies was impossible . Shrapnel continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heat was terrific . The flames , which Intermittently burst through the smoke screen showed the barracks where the ma ? tines had been quartered were destrayed . The barracks stood practically in the centre of the fifty magazines which it had erroneously been supposed were sufficiently separated so that an explosion of one would not spread to the others . One of every ten-windows in Dover was broken by the explosions , Many citizens left their homes , but their places were taken by hordes of refugees whose homes had either been made uninhabitable or were in danger from futother explosions . Twenty-five refugees , streaming In from the road leading to Picatinny arsenal , were lodged at the Dover House . Many residents opened their homes to people who flocked to Dover for safety . The fire , which continued burping with unabated fierceness , lit up the surrounding country for twenty miles . I All the main roads leading from Dover and Wharton to the two reservations even , guarded by State and local pm lice , who permitted only the cars of physicians and firemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited beyond the police lines for the moment when their occupants could satisfy their curiosity . Scores of ambulances with their complements of physicians and nurses also waited outside of the danger zone for cease so that they might ascertain if any of the marines still lived . But so far the only word is a dispatch froma Chief Pharmacist 's Mate prescott , sent to Headquarters of the Third Naval District in New York , which says : " Naval Ammunition Depot at Dover struck by lightning at 5 P. M. Apparently twenty people are saved . Survivors at Newfoundland in charge of Chief Gunner George Opp . " Newfoundland is a small hamlet near Lake Denmark .

By 9 o'clock the fire had spread to the Picatinny arsenal reservation which lies in a valley directly below the navy ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly wounded when the first of the army magazines began to explode , but continued on duty . The commander had already ordered all his enlisted and civilian personnel with their families from the reservation , and having posted guards to keep off those whose curiosity was stronger than their fear retired with his staff to the shelter of a golf bunker . While shell fragments fell about them , they remained observing the progress of the fire . Brooklyn Woman Killed . The first known victim of the explosion , for the:physicians at the hospitals were workingtoo strenuously to take the names of their patients , was Mrs. Francis Feeley of 130 West Twenty-ninth Street , Brooklyn , N.

Store windows in the Town of Rockaway , Morristown and Dover were shattered and many houses badly damaged , In Butler , N. J. , thirty miles from the scene of the explosion , window panes in the du Pont , fuse works were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , Telephone communication from the reservation was severed by the first explosion , but every one living in the near-by towns knew that the trouble came from either the envy depot or its close neighbor , the =ay arsenal , Fire ? men , physicians and Mines hastened immediately toward the depot , guided by the huge columns of smoke and flame , which were shooting up . But there was work for them all along the highway . There were hurt motorists crawling from beneath their machines , which had been hurled off the road , and there were men , women and children cut by glass whin had been shattered in the windows of their homes or hurt by falling wood or plaster . As those eager to aid drew nearer to the depot there came two more exIplosiov , almost as great as the first two . These were followed by more columns of flame and smoke , and the clouds of burning splinters and charred wood increased until they seemed to blot out the sky . III Exploding Shells a New Terror . Still the rescuers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled explosions which told ' them that thee high explosive shells stored at the depot were now going eft and that a new terror had been added to those which they must face . With the sky growing darker and darker ? as the debris rode fast and far on a high wind came a new impediment on the highways . This was the number of people flee- ' ing from the surrounding towns . The countryside knew the ammunition depot ; it knew there were fifty magazines filled with every variety of explosive , including the five which were filled with powder . It knew that the Picatinny arsenal a half mile away offered an equal danger . The wind fortunately was In the opposite direction from the arsenal and all of the damage there resulted from the explosions at the depot . When the firemen and physicians arrived close to the reservations they found their way blocked by the military and State troopers who would not let them venture on for fear of increasing the death total . Then it was that every one turned to the assistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away had been subjected to an intermitten rain of debris . At Pompton Lakes an equal distance from the depot , houses rocked with the explosions and there was a strong smell of sulphur and gunpowder . Village Homes Collapse . Several homes in the mining village of Mt . Hope , three miles north of the depot , collapsed under the concussions and there was work for the doctors here . At Rockaway , a small village four miles from the depot , the houses rocked crazily and there was general panic among the inhabitants . Screaming women and children fled into the fields to escape the timbers tumbling from their houses . The personnel of the Picatinny arsenal , with the exception of a guard , left when it appeared certain that nothing could be done to check the spread of flames from the ammunition depot . The soldiers and civilians dodged their way to safety while the exploding shells continued to fill the air with a hail of death . And always there came that stream of injured pouring into the hospitals ? a stream that would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and a sky darkened with smoke and debris .
