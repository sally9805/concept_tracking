So low was the air pressure in the apparatus that blows out the rifle barrels and closes the breeches that the latter had to be shoved home by hand after the second salvo , according to testimony of Francis Majewski , plug-man , whose duty it was to close the breech . He was one of the three sailors who escaped uninjured from the turret that became the tomb of his mates . Naval experts pointed out that lack of thorough cleansing of the gun barrels of fumes and gas after each discharge heightened the danger of ignition of powder left in the barrel or of any fresh charge that might be rammed in .
