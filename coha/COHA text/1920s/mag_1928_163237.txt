" I have the honor to inform you that on this day your mine has been reduced to ashes . . . . The losses which you have sustained in the aforementioned mine you may collect from the Government of the United States and Mr. Calvin Coolidge , who is truly responsible for the horrible and disastrous situation through which Nicaragua is passing at present . <P> " As long as the Government of the United States of North America does not order retirement of its pirates from our territory there will be no guarantee in this country for North Americans residing in Nicaragua . <P> " In the beginning I was confident that the people of North America would not be in accord with the abuses committed in Nicaragua by the Government of Mr. Calvin Coolidge , but I am now convinced that North Americans in general uphold the attitude of Coolidge in my country ; and it is for this reason that all that is North American that falls into our hands assuredly will have come to its end . <P> " ( Signed ) Augusto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a letter found last week amid the ruins of the two Nicaraguan gold mines owned by brothers of U.
