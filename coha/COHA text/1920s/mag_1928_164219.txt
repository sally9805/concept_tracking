The late King Alexander of Greece died of a monkey bite ( 1920 ) . Last week the Prime Minister of the Greek Republic , famed Eleutherios Venizelos , was bitten by a woman . <P> " Let me kiss your hand ! " pleaded the woman ( not old ) as M. Venizelos was leaving the Presidential Palace . After sinking her young teeth into the 64-year-old statesman 's hand she screamed , " You traitor to the King ! " fled . <P> Cried Eleutherios Venizelos , " Let her go ! I command it ! " Physicians pronounced the bite " clean , " scouted rumors of hydrophobia . <P> The king in whose name the bite was taken is George II , now banished , who recently and superfluously announced that he would return and rule over his country if called upon to do so by a national plebiscite .
