txt The ? conference at The Hague has. - - no* halted ell other business while France , Italy , Japan and Belgium consider the possibilities of meeting the British demands for a. greater share of the German reparations than is allotted to them under the Young plan . This afternoon the heads of ' those delegations had long meetings with their experts , - who were asked to draft a proposal which will be placed before the English on Friday . The four delegations were unanimous in deciding that the distribution scale of the Young plan could not be revised , officially . Nevertheless , a study is being made of the possibilities of meeting the British within the framework of the Young plan . It is believed that the four powers will prepare a statement for the English tending to show Philip Snowden , their Chancellor of the Exchequer , that he underestimated the British advantages Under the Young plan , and that if these are taken fully into account , Mr. Snowden will find his demand for an additional 45,000,000 marks ( about $10 , - 500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Spa Percentages . Mr. Snowden figures that the application of the Spa percentages in the German payments under the Young plan would give England . in addition to the part needed to meet her payments to America , an annual share of 100,000,000 marks , whereas the Young plan allows her 55,000,000 marks . It was thus that he arrived at his demand for 43,000,000 marks . But the others contend he did not take into consideration certain advantages that England gets from the liquidation of sequestered German property : front the provision meeting her payments to America , which are heavier , in proportion , in the next few years than that of the other former allies , and , so on . Thus , an effort is being made to cut down Mr. Snowden 's demand . Naturally , it is very difficult for Mr. Snowden to agree to the argument which means that he did not know the Young plan when he attacked it . Diplomatically , Mr. Snowden has been put into a poor position . The mere fact that tile other creditor nations are holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snowden has failed to get- the Germans on his side and Premier Briand of France has everyone else lined up against him . So . if the conference should break up over Mr. Snowden 's demands , all the other nations here will place the responsibility on the British . Certainly , there was no indication on the part of the four powers today to meet quickly Mr. Snowden 's demand by cutting their shares in the reparations . They do not believe that the Young plan is in real danger and that the worst that could happen here would be a delay . May Meet Other Demands . With regard to Mr. Snowden 's other dmiands , it is quite likely that a large degree of satisfaction can be given to him , but he has gone on record as making a request for 45 , - 000,000 marks additional as his chief demand , and so the conference may be said to hang on whether or not that demand can be satisfied . Unless Mr. Snowden is ready to admit miscalculation , the others allege , and unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other beneficiaries under the Young plan must give up something if England is to get more . If Mr.-Snowden can be satisfied the conference will probably resolve itself into a number of expert commissions to complete the final work after the meeting in the League of Nations Assembly n September . If Mr. Snowden is not satisfied , the conference will probably adjourn and the leaders will discuss things at Geneva . On the French side , it is believed that there would be another conference in six or seven weeks . One of the . encouraging developments today was the indication given by the Germans that they are willing to help meet Mr. Snowden 's demand that England be allocated 80,000,000 marks annually of the unconditional German payments . It is well known that Mr. Snowden wishes this sum for the flotation of loan receipts which the British Government would use in connection with its unemployment plans . The Germans could either increase , somewhat , the uit- ? conditional payments or give some other form of guarantee for the British . Quick Evacuation Seen . ? Naturally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the financial negotiations . There is every ' indication that if the Young plan is accepted , France , - England and- Belgium will withdraw their troops from the occupied regions quickly . Prime ' Minister wishes , as part of his Geneva program , to announce that the British troops have begun to move away from the Rhine . Howsomever , the Germans are much more interested in the ' movements of the last man than in the movements of the first man to go , for they obtain control of the occupied regions only when the . evacuation is complete . The British are anxious to have the evacuation completed by the end of the year if the Young plan goes into operation in September . And it is probable that Premier Briand. will swing in with them to apply this program to the second or Coblenz zone . As . for the first zone , M. Briand has been asked to wait until June , but it is known that private negotiations are going on to fix a date in March which the Germans will ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , this all hangs on the success of the negotiations for commencing the operation of the Young plan , for ' evacuation- can not begin until the Young plan begins to operate . At least such is the French position . This , as in everything , hinges on the satisfying of Mr. Snowden . Objectively , it would appear that there is a very large chance of success , but if one gets closer to the conference one observes the unhappy influence and bad atmosphere which was created by Mr. Snowden 's meth-1 ods in the first few days of the conference . There is no disposition on the part of any other of the delegates to give Mr. Snowden personal success . Yet , on the other hand , they all want the Young plan . Even if this conference adjourns , the Young plan would seem to be safe . It is now believed very doubtful if Mr. Thomas W. Lamont will come to The Hague . It was believed yesterday that he would accept the French invitation , but since then another delegation has expressed doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible the American financier will remain in England . This morning at the meeting of the financial commission Louis Loucheur , French delegate and Minister of Labor , made a soft-spoken speech in which , however , he declared that , while he was willing to make concessions on deliveries in kind , the basic provisions of the Young plan extending the deliveries in kind for ten years must be retained . He will accept the British demand for a rule against re-exportation . While sympathizing with the English problem of unemployment , M. Loucher expressed the opinion that the German payments in kind had only a small effect . The real cause , he said , lay in the effect . on European progression and American foreign trade . One-third of Europe 's trade with South America had gone to North America , he said , . and the results in Europe from the vigor of American trade expansion could not , he thought , be blamed on the German payment of reparations in kind .

American financial expert , today told inquirers that he was not planning to go to The 1 Hague , contrary to rumors prevalent that he would take a hand in the ! reparations deadlock .
