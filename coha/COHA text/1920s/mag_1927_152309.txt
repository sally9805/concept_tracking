Cheering , screaming frantic fanatics flooded George Herman ( " Babe " ) Ruth with the wildest ovation ever accorded a baseball player . In the eighth inning of a New York game against Washington , Ruth hit a ball pitched by left-handed Thomas Zachary into the right field bleachers . The home-run was Ruth 's 60th of the season . <P> Said Frederick G. Lieb , sage baseball writer : " It is doubtful if anyone in that crowd will ever live to see another baseball player hit his 60th home run in a 154-game season . I saw Ruth hit his 59th in 1921 and never thought I would score the game in which that record would be broken. * <P> Ruth 's record this year is chiefly owed to another member of Yankees . Directly behind Ruth on the batting list is Louis Gehrig . He too is a home-run hitter ( 47 for 1927 ) . With Gehrig next at bat , pitchers dare not give Ruth a complimentary base on balls , hoping to dispose of his successor easily . Ruth in 1927 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances to hit . <P> <P> * Anthony Lazzeri , present second baseman for the New York Yankees , hit 60 home runs in the Pacific Coast League in 1925 ; but the League plays a 200-game season .
