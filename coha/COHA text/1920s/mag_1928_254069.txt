Collective buying by ultimate consumers is not widely known in the U. S. ; but more than 5,000,000 Britons , mostly housewives , are owner-members of Cooperative Societies which buy goods to the stupendous value of $1,500,000,000 per year . <P> Last week the Cooperative Union Congress-representing the collective-buyer horde-met 4,000 strong in West Hartlepool . Soon the delegates were furiously debating whether to continue in active alliance with the British Labor Party . <P> Roared Delegate John Weatherhead : " Politics never grew an ounce of tea or turned a wheel . Let 's stick to trade and political independence ! " <P> " I know . . . " piped a delegate from Wallsend , " I know one Labor candidate who was elected to Parliament and wanted a new suit of clothes to wear up to London . But did he buy it ready-made in our Cooperative store ? No ! He went to a b --  tailor ! " <P> Although doubtless vexed by such tidings of Laborite dereliction , the Union Congress finally voted , with a few abstentions , 2,465 to 1,470 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large significance attached to this resolution , last week , because among the 5,000,000 collectionists represented by the Union Congress many are young housewives , under 30 , and these will soon be enabled to vote for the first time , by the confidently expected passage of the Equal Franchise ( " Votes For Flappers " ) Bill ( TIME , June 4 , et ante ) . Collective buying thus looms as an appreciable factor in moulding the new Flapper Electorate .
