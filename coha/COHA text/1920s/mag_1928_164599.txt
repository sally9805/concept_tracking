Aboard the Hoover bandwagon there clambered last week : <P> 1 ) Governor Fred R. Zimmerman of Wisconsin , who in 1924 was part of his State 's " bolt " from the convention that nominated Calvin Coolidge to the skirmishers who later nominated the late La-Follette . Governor Zimmerman , prodigal , visited President Coolidge at Brule , Wis. ( see p. 7 ) . Governor Zimmerman , candidate for reelection , began opening Hoover-Zimmerman clubs . Governor Zimmerman said that after the eight-year ( 1912-1920 ) Democratic rgime in Washington " it is but a miracle that there is anything at all left of America to be corrupt with . " This was a rebuttal of current Democratic talk about the Oil Scandals . <P> 2 ) Senator Smith Wildman Brookhart of Iowa . His method of transferring from the defunct Farm Revolt to the triumphant Hoover vehicle was to attack one of Lowdenism 's loudest promoters , George N. Peek , executive chairman of the Corn Belt Conference . He accused Mr. Peek of plotting to ditch Lowden in favor of Vice President Dawes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill . Mr. Peek has lately been advising farmers to go Democratic . Piqued at Peek , Senator Brookhart said the Democratic farm plank was worse than the Republican ; that Hoover knows more about the farm problem than Smith . <P> 3 ) Senator Charles S. Deneen of Illinois . He was a Lowdenite . Lowdenism 's fight on Hooverism was featured by frantic assertions that Hooverism could not carry Illinois . Presumably , Nominee Curtis was Senator Deneen 's excuse for predicting , last week , for the Hoover-Curtis ticket " a great majority in Illinois . " <P> 4 ) Vice President Charles Gates Dawes . In Chicago , he repeated that he would rather have seen Lowden nominated , but said : " If needed , I am ready to campaign for the ticket . Hoover will be elected . " <P> 5 ) Boyish Senator Gerald Prentice Nye of North Dakota . He swung grudgingly aboard after having abused Hooverism for many weeks . He said that it would require hard work but that North Dakota could and would be Hooverized.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
