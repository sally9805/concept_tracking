WE often think back to the funny days when writing was done largely by writers . The situation , of course , has changed . The most successful writers now are people who have dropped whatever else they were doing , and taken up the pen overnight  --  former presidents , shortstops , comedians , aviators , movie actors , fighters . We have followed eagerly the progress in belles-lettres of Cal Coolidge and Al Smith . We have glimpsed the rise of Babe Ruth as a sporting expert . Last week we saw his ranks joined by practically every player of the Cubs and the Athletics they were so busy writing for the papers they hardly had time to step up to bat . We have seen the Star of Will Rogers in the ascendant and traced his progress to the staff of the New York Times . Bloody but unbowed , we stood up against this frightful competition , striking out right and left with our faithful typewriter . But when we learned the other day that Lillian Gish had contributed an article to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Things look pretty black ; we 're ready to take the count . M a . LA GUARDIA has said plenty about the Casino . He failed to point out , however , that the Casino , whatever its sins , is not even an especially good place to eat . That 's what makes us mad . The food and the service are not sufficiently distinguished for the prices , which are pretty fanciful . The only really distinguished fealure of the Casino is its board of governors  --  and nobody sees much of them . The diners sit around , idly chewing their food , or staring at the hour . We 'd appreciate it if the presence of the governors were made obligatory . A rough schedule could be maintained , like this : Mondays , Jules S. Bache ; Tuesdays , James H. R. Cromwell ; Wednesdays , James Van Alen . And so OD . For Sundays and Yte days there should he special teams or " combinations . " We suggest ( we are just thinking out loud ) A. E. Lefcourt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr. , John Randolph Hearst and Florenz Ziegfeld . The gentlemen need net do anything  --  just sit quietly and lend tune . ' JITNEY WARREN has succeeded : the message of hate will be careen in stone on the Louvain Library . It is a great victory for American vulgarity , the greatest , to our notion , of all time . The outrageous inscription , " Destroy-ed by German fury , rebuilt by American generosity , " will stand on the Library , making it a monument to international discord . The only moderating circumstance is the fact that it is written in Latin , which people have difficulty reading these days . It 's there just the same ; and we are wondering to ourself how much of a job it would he for a stealthy amateur , armed with a cold chisel and a mallet , to obliterate the letters . Men have died for less Worthy causes  --  and so would we . Will anyone lend us a ladder ? WE 'LL soon know what stuff women are made of . The corset people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their freedom . A big advertisement in the paper this week bore the astounding ultimatum : " You more wear a corset . This season every woman , no matter how perfect her proportions , needs a restraining influence . " There 's a challenge , if ever there was one . Having escaped into the open , is Woman going to crawl back to cover again ? Is she going to sneak into her little whalebone sanctuary , safe and smug ? Is Man again to live through an era of unravelling his mate before he can discover her ? The ad spoke of corsets as " foundation garments . " Ah , how true that is . Must we again shake women to their very foundations ? VDR a little spell now it will be impossible for anyone to walk across the Queensboro Bridge to Long Island . The south footpath has been closed . Trucks may batter their way along , cars may fight for their inch gains at twilight , the I.R.T. may curve in happy flight to Astoria ; but the plowman , plodding homeward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross . It turns out that the city is widening the roadway by encroaching on the footpath . Because the Bridge was a place we sometimes went to glimpse the full dance of life , we are aroused and full of a deep hurt at thus being cut off . Walking will soon be illegal everywhere . Bridge vehicular traffic will soon he completely deadlocked . Long Island will be a case of swimming or not at all . Golden Apples SOLOMON 'S gold , or some of it the Inca 's Fold , a great deal of the gold that has for these many centuries caused happiness and woe , is right here in New York now , under the Federal Reserve Bank , which takes up the block bounded by Nassau and William Streets , Maiden Lane and Liberty . It is the biggest treasure store in the city , which is to say in the world . In value it totalled about a billion dollars at the close of business Monday . All of it is now in the custody of Colonel Hiram Ridings Bearss , D.S.C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hikern Hiram , " under which denomination lie became pretty well known before the war , and better known during it . He was noted for laying out long , preposterous marches for his troops and then riding up and down the column making them hustle . He must see that nobody steals the gold . The treasure is kept in three tiers of vaults beneath the street level , beneath tidewater too , to make tunnelling difficult . There , under Bearss , a hundred ex-service men , many of them known personally to the Colonel , are on duty , all expert with the rifle , the revolver , and the machine gun . He runs the place like a garrison . His office is exactly like a military headquarters except that he has a girl secretary . Peace has done that . A platoon of men is constantly on post at the vaults , vigilantly watching them and peering into mirrors which are arranged in a complicated manner to show any activity anywhere in the place . The most ' responsible job is getting the gold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which cuts into the bank , like an estuary , from Maiden Lane . In the walls are ominous slits through which Bearss ' soldiers peer over rifle barrels . Nobody has ever tried anything desperate in this sector . It 's like Gibraltar . THE Colonel is now fifty-four . He is a great disciplinarian , androars , but has a sense of humor . He has always been considered tough , in the better meaning of the word . He attended military school in Vermont and there , although weighing only a hundred and thirty-eight , made the football team . Later he played on the eleven of the Athletic Club of St. Albans , Vermont , against a team from Burlington made up of blacksmiths and locomotive engineers . After three min-utes of play Burlington refused to go on unless Bearss was removed . They said he Was too rough . In 1899 he became a lieutenant in the Marines and since has soldiered all over the world . In 1914 , when the Marines . landed in Vera Cruz , Bearss was already there , having quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . He took command of his battalion and by his knowledge of the city made its capture possible with a minimum loss of life . For this he got the Distinguished Service Medal . Like all soldiers , he is prouder of his Distinguished Service Cross . This is awarded for valor in action . Bearss got his at Chateau Thierry . General Harhord wanted a German prisoner and asked the Colonel to get him one . This is the grimmest order a soldier can receive . Vide " Journey 's End , " General Harbord said he would give the Colonel a seven days ' Leave if he brought in a German . " I 'll get you two and take fourteen days , " Bearss told him . That night some of his men saw him walking nonchalantly into No Man 's Land , alone . Four or five of them insisted on going with him . They encountered an enemy scout patrol and a short , bloody action followed . Shortly after this , the light of star shells revealed Bearss headed for his own lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . H'elcume THE October business of moving from one apartment to another apartment was made less gruesome for one lady by an incident that occurred after the ordeal WAS virtually over . The movers had puffed up the longstairs with pianos and refectory tables on their backs ; everything had been stowed softly ; and it was time for the men to go . Just as the lady was about to sink into the nearest chair for a comfortable sigh , the head man of the crew turned in the doorway , removed his cap , and delivered a two-minute speech of welcome which included felicitations on life in the new apartment and a rather neat emphasis on the Words " happiness " and " prosperity . " The lady ca n't yet decide whether the speech sounded a trifle studied ; she is inclined to think the fellow was just a bit out of breath .

It is not generally known , but the Mexican-jumping-bean craze of last year threatened to fade out , leaving a good many earnest saffron-farmers below the Rio Grande in a pretty fix ; not to mention a group of energetic jobbers up here . The situation has been saved , however . A resourceful novelty man was called in and , after thinking awhile , he brought forth the **32;411;TOOLONG game which is now having a vogue not only in the city but all over the country . Everybody is happy again , including the players , who get quite excited racing the little jumpers , if they are in fettle , If they are n't in fettle , this can be fixed . There 's trick to it which we have from a fellow who has done well wagering on the game . A bean can be greatly stimulated by a brisk rubdown between the palms . just before the start . Also , holding it under a light bulb is effective , but likely to cause arguments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards offered in the shops of late . We went into one place to ask about these . " No special advantage , " said the clerk . " Just round cards . " He said they were selling well as many people will buy anything new . We thought afterward that the round cards probably are an improvement on the rectangular ones for tossing into a hat  --  conducive to accuracy . Race of Life AWOMAN insurance agent ( they 're in that business too , now ) fought her way into the presence of a busy executive and in five minutes , grimly and energetically , covered the whole insurance situation , turned his private life inside out , learning all about the number of dependents , how they felt and all , and rose to depart . At the end the bewildered man said : " I must say , madam , that you are certainly a rapid worker . " " I 've been on the verge of a nervous breakdown for four years and I have to work fast , " the lady explained . Glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tioning that Pinaud 's planned one for store purposes in the East Twenties . The structure is n't up yet ; in fact , has n't been started . The municipal engineers are still trying to digest this radical idea and have n't approved the plans . The upper stories of the new building the Chanins are planning on the site of the Century Theatre , however , will be a combination of glass and metal and there is much talk of all-Lrlass buildings here and there , so much that sooner or later there is bound to be one , or a whole city of them for all anyone knows . The glass enthusiasts say that our present skyscrapers are a mistake and that plainly they will have to be torn down and replaced with sensible buildings . Among those who have been talking about glass are the vestrymen of Dr. Guthrie 's St. Mark 's In-theBouwerie , who are ever cannily seeking sound investments for the church funds . They have been in consultation with Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright , the western architect known for his radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next spring , on plots adjoining the church grounds , fur four apartment houses of glass . Wright is a glass-building man , although not exclusively . He would also build of copper , brass , and a lot of materials other than clay . The original glass man seems to be Mr. Frederick Keppler , who is interested in the Pinaud project . Twenty-five years ago , when a young architect in London , he stood looking out of a window at the fog . Why , he wondered , must only windows let in light and all the rest of the wall-space he opaque ? Subsequently he experimented with a brick of glass and finally got one that he considered satisfactory . His principal difficulty-was making one so that it would let light through but not the human gaze . He met this by putting on each brick a design in relief , which distorts vision . Later , learning that the city of Metz was dissatisfied with its railroad station because it was too gloomy , he went there and got a contract to put on a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades has helped cheer people waiting for trains on dreary days . Since 22 OCTOBER I 9 , 1 9 Z 9 then he has done various buildings in all parts of the world  --  factories , libraries , banks , etc. , imid a consulate in Korea , and a crystal dome on the Royal Palace at Brussels . His oddest contract was in Budapest . Twu neigh-hors quarrelled . One decided to put up a spite fence but was thwarted temporarily because the law forbade high walls of brick or stone . He heard about Keppler and got him to build one of glass . It stands today , a little sight fur tourists . M . KEPPLER , now a resident of RNew York , has put up a glass-brick factory in Long Island City , which he runs in conjunction with a studio for turning out mosaics . This he opened five years ago . At that time Tiffany 's was the only firm doing mosaic work here . He started up and has done panels and such for many buildings , St. Bartholomew 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of the stairs and in the bathrooms on the Bremen . At the studio Keppler 's artisans work before full-sized color sketches of the picture they are making . Piecing the bits of glass together is slow work ; it takes thirty hours to make a person 's head , life-size . There are ten thousand different shades of colored glass , " Good old Frank and Alice how 1 miss Alice ! " eight hundred tines of gold and silver alone . Rouge et Noir " THE best thing I 've seen at this - A-  station in years , " a gateman at Grand Central Terminal told us , " happened about a month ago when a big Wall Street man was leaving for Chicago . I saw him coming toward the gates with one of the outside , or Black Cap , porters carrying his bags . I expected him to dismiss the Black Cap at the gate and call one of the regular Red Caps , since it is a well-known rule that outside porters are not allowed to go through to the platforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and when I stopped him , he was indignant . I explained the rule , and three or four Red Caps strolled over to take over his baggage , but nothing would persuade that man . Finally he strode indignantly away , accompanied by the faithful Black Cap . A few minutes later back the two of them came , making straight for the gate . Again I stepped in front of them but the Wall Street man waved me aside . This gentleman , ' he said , with dignity , indicating the porter , ' is going to Chicago . Perhaps you 'd better look at his ticket to see that it 's all right . ' I examined the ticket and found it was all proper  --  extra fare , Pullman , everything . The other day one of the boy ; had a post card frum that porter . He decided to stay in Chicago . Likes it fine out there . " Fan YOU may have noticed that the whole Department of Justice rushed into the murder mystery of Virginia McPherson , a Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder in which no prominent persons are involved is not a matter for the Attorney General of the United States . The reason seems to he that the murder ( it might only have been suicide ) aroused President Hoover 's curiosity . More than a hundred persons were suspected  --  and it is n't every murder that can boast one hundred suspects . Anyway , the President , who is a great reader of detective tales , apparently was absorbed and fascinated by the mysterious ramifications of the affair . He had the old urge to turn to the last chapter and peek . The Department of Justice , knowing that Mr. Hoover could hardly wait to see how it would come out , thought they better dig in and help the police . That 's what people say , anyway . Cuticle History TO add to our collection of firsts , we have unearthed the history of the first manicurist 's shop in town . It was founded by one Mary E. Pray in the late seventies . Up to that time , surprisingly enough , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails of the populace . The business has its moments and its romance and also its glamorous figure , Miss Louise Lewis , now going on eighty , last of the pioneers . In the seventies , Mrskl4 Pray , long since deceased , practiced chiropody in smart Twenty-third Street . One day a client , fresh from a voyage to Europe , came in to exhibit a shiny manicuring set she had bought in Paris . Mrs. Pray , immediately recognizing an opportunity , orTHE NEW YORKER 23 ( 5 ifqtf.1 - " Waiter , ask the boys to play ' Just a 7 : . ) , Ile Love , a Little Kiss . ' " ? ? tiered another set from Paris and , when it arrived , set up as a manicurist ? America 's first . Shortly thereafter Miss Lewis became her assistant . In 1882 Mrs. Pray vanished from the picture and Miss Lewis opened her own shop . She moved slowly uptown with the fashionables , finally to Forty-ninth Street . A few years ago she retired after a very full life for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their homes . Thus she early came in contact with famous families . She has trimmed the cuticles of almost innumerable Whitneys , Pens , Vanderhilts , Morrises , Stokeses , Sloanes , Potters , Clewses , Astors , and Waterburys . In many homes she came to be accepted on a semi-social basis . She still is asked to the weddings of the children andgrandchildren of some of her clients . They know her simply as Louise . On first nights of the opera season she has for years occupied a seat in the orchestra circle . She likes to glance around the Diamond Horseshoe and " see all her people together . " Several ladies always lend her their boxes during the season , among them Mrs. Kahn . Thus , last year , she entertained thirty-five friends in the Horseshoe . Miss Lewis trimmed the nails of two first ladies of the land , Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Cleveland , and many times attended the late J. P. Morgan . That was before the days of manicurists in barber shops . Mr. Morgan used to phone her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing and go to his house with her kit . She has a large collection of photographs of fine ladies and gallant gentlemen of the last half century which she has refused to part with although large offers have been made for it . She was always a poor business woman lost the first ten thousand dollars she made by conducting an advertising campaign for manicuring incidentals before putting her goods on the market . Readers of her ads bought a rival 's product . In 1901 she got up the first advertisement of a manicure set that was allowed to appear in the wary Ladies ' Home Journal . Still active and interested in " her people , " she lives at the American Women 's Association Club , of which she was a charter member . N ewes is THEY may be slow , but Whalen 's men are thorough . For instance : in June , 1928 , somebody sent in a complaint about a little Italian grocer down in Jones Street . He was selling a good deal of something generally referred to as vinegar but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . Well , time went on , as it does in the Village . The grocer bought an estate in IVestche.ster , the building passed into other hands and was remodelled , store and all , into studio apartments . Sixteen months later , which brings us down to last Monday , a police sergeant called with a little notebook and a pencil in his hand , to investigate this business of vinegar versus wine . He puttered around for a while , rang various bells , and seemed pretty much annoyed to discover finally that the place where the store should have been was now occupied by a commercial artist . " Well , what do you want me to do ? " the artist , exasperated , demanded . " Open up a store here again ? " Evidently the sergeant had not considered this possibility . He thought a while , and then his brow cleared . " No , no , " he decided . " Just leave everything lay the way it is " ? and strolled off , twirling his pencil .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
