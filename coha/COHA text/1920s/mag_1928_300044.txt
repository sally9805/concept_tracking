Two months ago , in a field , not far from Los Angeles , Calif. , they were harvesting barley . Then came hordes of men bearing tons of wood , truck loads of nails , 9,000 barrels of oil , 2,000,000 gallons of water , The wood and nails they made into a grandstand ( capacity 17,000 ) into an exposition building , ultra modern , larger than a city block . The oil and water they sprinkled on the field so that whirling hundreds of propellers would not raise a dust . <P> Last week the National Air carnival at Mines field reached its climax . A Navy aviator climbed 10,000 feet in four-and-a-half minutes . An Army flier , Lieut . J. J. Williams was killed in formation stunt flying , Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh took his place , continued Immelman turns , loops , barrel rolls . But a Navy trio gave a superior exhibition of stunts . <P> In the exposition hall were 300 brightly colored booths , housing nearly every design of plane or accessory on the market . A professor demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying pickle . " <P> There were many races , the most important of which was the non-stop transcontinental derby . Col. Arthur Goebel in a Wasp-motored Lockhead-Vega Yankee Doodle was the first to arrive . But he won no prize because he had stopped once to refuel . Even so his time from New York to Los Angeles was a record ; 23 hours , 50 minutes . The other entrants in the race had been forced down . Col. William Thaw seriously injured , had said before starting on the race : " I 'm fat , I 'll bounce . " <P> The carnival was attended by 400,000 ( 75,000 on the last day ) . Five million dollars worth of airplanes were sold . A statue of Col. Lindbergh was always a centre for a crowd .
