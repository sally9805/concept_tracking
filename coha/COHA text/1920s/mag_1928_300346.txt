Than President Coolidge the U. S. people have seldom had a better tutor in U. S. geography . His person is the pointer , public prints are the textbook . Last week the President announced that he would spend his holidays on Sapeloe Island , off the coast of Georgia . Researches forthwith exhumed a history stretching continuously from the Mayan age to the U. S. tycoon age of today . <P> Sapeloe Island , eight miles by four , lies between Brunswick and Savannah , close to the marsh-fringed mainland . Originally it belonged to the Creek Indians , whose ancestors left trinkets and earthworks showing they were influenced by the Mayan culture of distant Yucatan . <P> Sapeloe is one of the southern chain of American sea-islands mentioned in Icelandic sagas of the loth century as part of Huitramanaland or Great Ireland . Portuguese sailors supplied data for a map which showed the islands in 1502 . The Spanish arrived in 1512 and called the broad-beached land they found the " Golden Islands . " It was from one of their missions , San Jos de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French tried and the British succeeded in ousting the Spaniards , in 1742 . The battle of Bloody Marsh , won by Georgia 's Founder-Governor Oglethorpe on St. Simon 's Island , near Sapeloe , was one of the actions decisive in breaking Spain 's grip on continental America . <P> Howard Earle Coffin , retired motors tycoon , bought Sapeloe 17 years ago and developed it the way other tycoons ( Goulds , McAlpins , Rockefellers , Drexels , Fords , Carnegies , du Ponts , et al. ) have developed Jekyl , St. Simon 's and other Golden Islands. * He built a mansion Spanish in style , Southern in rambling scope . He cut bridle paths and motor roads and stocked his forest with pheasants , peacocks , wild turkeys , deer .. Quail , ' possum and waterfowl were there in natural abundance . Through no imaginable chance should the President be " skunked " again on his next shooting foray if he makes it on Sapeloe . Mrs. Coolidge , who likes swimming , will doubtless try the mansion 's blue-tiled , glass-domed swimming pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . <P> <P> President Coolidge took up a pen and wrote " Calvin . " He took up another pen and wrote " Cool . " With a third pen he wrote " idge " and as he dotted the " i " the Swing-Johnson bill , authorizing the Federal Boulder Dam in Black Canyon on the Colorado River , became effective . California 's Senator Johnson and Representative Swing stood by , rejoicing over their seven-year job , done at last . Each legislator got one of the pens . The third pen was handed to a Hearst newspaperman . Dr. Elwood Mead , chief of the U. S. Reclamation Service ( Interior Department ) , immediately sent a telegram to his chief engineer at Denver , directing him to mobilize a construction army and begin the $165,000,000 project forthwith . In Southern California and Nevada , people fired shotguns and banged on frying pans for joy . <P> President Coolidge consented to sit for another oil portrait , to hang in the New York Genealogical and Biographical Building , Manhattan . <P> President &; Mrs. Coolidge dined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Northampton , Mass. , to visit her mother , Mrs. Goodhue , sicker than ever in Dickinson Hospital .
