txt Myron E. Forbes , president of Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Co. has every reason to be pleased over the attention which Pierce-Arrow securities are again receiving from Wall Street , for it was largely through his efforts that the company was turned away from the financial rocks toward which it was headed after the deflation . The result of his work has been to add two highlypromising prospects to the Pierce line in the form of the motor bus and the lower-priced six-cylinder car . At the same time , under his administration bank debt has receded frorri above $7,000,000 to around $1,000,000 . But with all that he has accomplished Forbes seems to have a little private regret , which he voiced the other day . You remember . " he said to one of his associates , " I told you - when we were trying out our new bus on the Buffalo roads a year ago last February that some day someone with , patience would make a lot of money in Pierce-Arrow stocks . If I had followed my own prediction I might have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I happen to be an automobile manufacturer , not a speculator , and the rewards - seem to come more slowly in that field .
