President George K. Morrow of the Gold Dust Corp . telephoned lawyers of John D. Rockefeller last week . Mr. Rockefeller and his friends owned 95,000 shares of American Linseed Co. ' s preferred stock , and President Morrow wanted that preferred stock as a good beginning toward buying full control of American Linseed . Later he would deal with Laird , Bissell &; Meeds ( investment bankers ) and others who owned American Linseed common stock . <P> American Linseed , organized in 1898 , has been the leading U. S. manufacturer of linseed oil and its derivatives . Out of flaxseed , which it gets in the U. S. , Canada , Argentine , India , it makes the oil essential for the manufacture of paints , varnishes , printers ' inks , linoleum , oilcloth ( American cloth ) and like products . By-products are linseed oil cake , oil meal , poultry feed , cattle feed . <P> But flaxseed , like all agricultural produce , is a whimsical item . Sometimes there is want , and the price is dear . Irregular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 30 full years it has paid a total of only $5.25 on its common stock , and not much more on its preferred . Flaxseed was the chief trouble . <P> Gold Dust had similar trouble with the cotton seed oil , feeds and other derivatives made by the American Cotton Oil Co. which it absorbed in 1923 . The cotton oil business did not pay . Gold Dust abandoned it and pushed the sale of cleansers made by the American Cotton Oil 's subsidiary , N. K. Fairbank Co . Those cleansers are Gold Dust , Fairy Soap , Sunny Monday Soap and like products . To them President Morrow late in 1925 added by purchase the shoe polishes of the F. F. Dalley Corp. - Shinola , Two-in-One , Bixby brands . Early this year he was negotiating to add Ball fruit jars and Crosse &; Blackwell 's good English jams , marmalades and other dainties . The Gold Dust Corp . stock is worth at current quotations , $29,464,300 . <P> American Linseed has not tried to abandon flaxseed products .

On the Pacific Coast its Gold Medal mayonnaise is the favorite salad dressing . Of these food items American Linseed , said Chairman Robert H. Adams this spring , last year sold $17,000,000 worth . Last February the Atlantic &; Pacific chain groceries alone sold 1,000,000 packages of Nucoa margarine . That explains to a great extent why American Linseed , despite the negligence of past dividends , was seriously considered worth $37,687,500.
