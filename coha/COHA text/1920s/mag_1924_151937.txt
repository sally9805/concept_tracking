On the sedgy , low-lying Sasco links ( Fairfield , Conn. ) eight amateur golf notables of both sexes held a private pre-championship showing of their wares . They had been lured thither by kind invitations , by promises of silver putters , bronze , silver and golden golf balls as prizes . <P> Attention centered on three of the women , the Big Three of the National women 's title play that would begin at Providence , R. I. , Sept. 1 : National Champion Edith Cummings , Miss Glenna Collett ( 1922 champion ) , Miss Marion Hollins ( 1921 champion ) . Mrs. Quentin Feitner ( six-time Metropolitan champion ) was the fourth . The men were National Champion Max R. Marston , onetime champions Francis Ouimet and Jess Sweetser , French champion John G. Anderson . <P> First the four women played together . The Misses Cummings and Hollins routed Miss Collett and Mrs. Feitner in a slow-moving best ball affair . Stalwart Miss Hollins seemed sound and solid in every department of her game ; Miss Cummings was brilliant but a touch patchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace or indifferent to the matter in hand , played a casual round . <P> Then the men " spotted " the women five bisques+ each and played them individual matches . As the two National champions went into battle , Miss Cummings was heard to taunt Mr. Marston : " Why , Max , no man in the world can give me five bisques and get away with it ! " <P> She recalled beating Marston in similar matches at Garden City in 1923 , at Philadelphia in 1923 ; and whatever " Indian sign " she had on him then , she still possessed . Confused , Marston topped drives , missed putts , was beaten 3 and 2 with only three bisques used against him . The rest of the men won . <P> The mixed foursomes were last , " Little Glenna " and " Big Jess " carrying off the golden golf balls . In these matches , where the men and women took alternate shots with the same ball , it was remarked how little difference there is between the best play of crack golfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful hitters , were pounding their tee shots 215 to 230 yards - far enough for any man . At pitching and short approaches to the pin , all the women were as accurate as the men . Miss Cummings perhaps more so . Her mashie-niblic manipulation is her chef d'oeuvre . Miss Collett 's putting was deadlier than any save steady Ouimet 's . <P> It was in consistency and in play through the fairway that the discrepancies appeared . No woman can get a man 's distance with brassie or iron out of a cuppy lie . Few women can play as many consecutive good shots as a man without " cracking . " <P> +A bisque is a handicap stroke given in match play that may be used by its recipient on any hole he elects . Recipient must , however , state his intention of using the stroke before playing the next hole .
