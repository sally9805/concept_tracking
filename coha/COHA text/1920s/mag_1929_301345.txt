In his study at the Community Church in New York , once known as the Church of the Messiah , the Rev. John Haynes Holmes knit his brows over a sermon he was preparing for Christmastide . He had his notions about this man Jesus . <P> While choirs in a thousand naves of Christian churches throughout Manhattan lifted their voices in the ancient glad Noels , while bells in the towers quivered with anticipation of midnight chimes to herald the eternal rebirth of the Babe , Pastor Holmes took the platform . <P> The place to look for Jesus is in the Jewish synagogs , he solemnly assured his congregation . More of the religion of Jesus is taught in the synagogs than in all the Christian churches put together . <P> Christians err , announced Pastor Holmes , when they speak of the Resurrection : " There is not the slightest shred of evidence that Jesus ever rose from the dead . " Christians are all wrong because they do n't understand the really great things Jesus did , such as wage war on Church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apotheosize the carpenter who loved the title " Son of Man . " <P> Jesus taught the Jewish religion , and his religion " remains Jewish all the same . " <P> There was holly in the Rev. Mr. Holmes 's church during Christmas week , and some special music on Sunday , but nothing in the way of a carol service . On Christmas Day , the church was dark . <P> In books and sermons Pastor Holmes has , since going to the Church in 1907 , identified himself with the radicals on all subjects : Jesus , marriage , socialism . In his own report of his activities in Who 's Who he dates his rationalistic coming of age thus : " Left Unitarianism and became independent , 1919 . " <P> His views on marriage have made newspaper copy from time to time , since the publication in 1913 of his book , Marriage and Divorce . Marriage , he contended , must be regarded as a human institution , a social form to be used so long as it is useful , and to be abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , but the test of a true marriage is " spiritualization of the physical instinct of sex attraction . " He approved of divorce whenever affection has dwindled . <P> In 1920 he published a study of the economic situation . Is Violence the Way Out ? In this he aligned himself definitely with the working class in the capital-labor fight . By some method Labor must eventually triumph , and a completely new order of society must be established . But it would be folly for labor to use violence to attain its end . <P> In New Churches for Old ( 1922 ) he urged : get rid of theology , develop in its place a conception of religion as a social fellowship . He is against war and whiskey .
