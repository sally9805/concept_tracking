Representative of Pennsylvania , Republican , Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee and head of the special committee , submitted a minority , report , in which he said that if the investigation had proceeded further there might have been a different conclusion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another member , in an independent report , scoffed at the majority findings . The summary contained in the majority report says : " The evidence discloses : " ' 1 . That there has been duplication of bonds , some fraudulent , the proportion not yet determined : " 2 . That the report of the Treasury relative ' thereto is incomplete . contradictory and evasive , and the testimony it offered to show innocent error was refuted : " 3 . That records have been falsified ? the extent of which is unknown to the committee ; " 4 . That indifference to duplications has been prevalent ; " 5 . That legal remedies have been neglected in the payment of duplicates ; " 0 . That destruction of bonds was conducted in haste And that destruction records are not dependable : " 7 .

" Duplicate payments of identical bonds stolen from Treasury vaults by em .. ployes and again circulated have been made , " states the report . " The extent of such thefts is rendered uncertain by inexact methods and faulty accounting . In great detail the contention of Secretary Mellon that duplicate numbers are out but that duplication does not exist in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says : ' A suggestive circumstance is that duplication of $50 and $100 denominations are much the most numerous and , being more easily disposed . of without arousing suspicion , they arouse our suspicion of their being more the result of design than accident . The fact that many of the bonds are destroyed , malting it impossible to tell which were honest and which were spurious when duplicate numbers are presented , emphasizes the importance of the issue as to destruction of the bonds . " It is also stated in the report : " Whether or not the major duplication resulted therefrom is not to be determined , but it is clear there was opportunity for fraudulent wholesale duplication of Government bonds at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . the Division of Loans and Currency and the Register 's Offiee , and that the opportunity was so created by the abandonment of regulations formerly designed as safeguards and was encouraged by loose practices in bookkeeping and accounting methods and failure to cancel bonds when paid and that some outstanding frauds have resulted from these practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp paper and distinctive silk fibre paper and as to shortages of securities in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and as to the destruction of securities in the Division of Loans and Currency . " Part of the report is devoted to the argument that , " in the repurchasing on the market for the bond purchase fund , the sinking fund , &c.,; the Treasury employed the War Finance Corporation from May 20 , 191$ , to June 30. 1920 , and a part of 1922. and frequently , instead of promptly turning into the Treasury the bonds so purchased . the War Finance Corporation accumulated large quantities of bonds after they had been purchased , and held them and collected a sum totaling nearly $2R,000.000 in interest from the United States Treasury . " Changing of Records Alleged . During the period of the transactions discussed and up until a recent date , the report says , the Managing Director of the War Finance Corporation , in his Private capacity , maintained an office at 14 Wall Street , New York City , and through the War Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also bought through the War Finance Corporation about $10,000. - 000 in bonds and approved the bills for meat . if not all , of these bonds in his official capacity as Managing Director of the War Finance Corporation . When those transactions just referred to were disclosed to the committee in open hearing , the Managing Director appeared before the committee awl said that , while the books of the War Finance Corporation disclosed the fact that Commissions were paid on these transactions , they were in turn paid over to the brokers , selected by the Managing Director , who executed the orders issued by his brokerage house . Immediately after this disclosure to the committee the Managing Director employed Ernst &; Ernst , certified public accountants , to audit the books of the War Finance Corporation . Upon the cornPlotion of their examination of these books they reported to the committee that all moneys received by the brokerage house of the Managing Director had been accounted for , the report continues . ? ? Whi le simultaneously- with the examination being made by the committee the certified public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was discovered by your committee that alterations and changes were being made in the books of record covering these transactions . and when the same was called to the attention of the Treasurer of the War Finance Corporation he admitted to the committee that chances were being made . To what extent these books have been altered during this process the committee has not been able to determine . " Indignation is expressed by the committee that bonds " were destroyed without authority of law , " and a " personal and confidential letter " from former President Harding to the Treasury demanding that destruction cease pending investigation is printed in the report . After June , 11121 , the report says , there were about $10,000,000,000 worth of securities destroyed . " The methods followed when the bonds were being destroyed , " the report says . " show that , rather than a duplication of the public debt requiring a multitude of people , a premise to the conclusion of the Secretary of the Treasury that duplication resulted from innocent error , destruction , as practiced. offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , to recirculate the Government securities with little chance of detection by removing them from the packages d est royed . " The majority report recommends that the printing of the securities be taken from the Bureau of Loans and Currency of the Treasury , and that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing also be separated , as well as the office of the Register of the Treasury . and that these last two should report to a joint committee of Congress . Defends Treasury . In his minority report Mr. said he withheld his signature because in his judgment the report . " under the exigencies of the situation , " was presented prematurely , and because if the presentation had not been forced by the approaching end of Congress the report " might have had a different tenor and different recommendations , " Although the committee had worked as speedily as possible , its bearings were curtailed in time to get the report in. he continued . There was no opportunity to hear all the witnesses from the Treasury nor to permit cross-examination by that department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my judgmment , should be fully accorded to it . " He had wanted the committee 's authority continued so that it could hold further hearings . But this having been refused , he could not sign a report , which , under the " necessities of the case is incomplete and which if hearings had been continued , might have , stated different conclusions and necessarily different recommendations , " he concluded . Mrs Strong declared he did not agree with the conclusions of the majority or the statements on which they were based . There were duplicate numbered bonds , but he did not find that these were spurious or fraudulent , nor that the Government did not receive full payment , he said . He did find " that there were errors made and that some petty thieving occurred . " lie reported , but that these were not more than could be expected under wartime conditions . He said it was remarkable that in handling over $1-10,000,000,000 of bonds and other securities front the start of the war until now the . Treasury sustained so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . Mr. Strong recalled that Secretary Mellon had repeatedly said the charges were unfounded . The majority report , Mr. Strong added , dealt with matters which occurred before Mr. Mellon assumed office and that the Secretary would have no personal or political reason for defending any such charges , even if true . The investigation has cost the Government hundreds of thousands of dollars in time . labor and other expense and the select committee has expended $10,000 . Mr. Strong said , adding that to go further would be a " great waste of public moneys. "
