txt The British public , irrespective of party , is reported to be rubbing its eyes and hands over the remarkable showing of the new Labor Government . It must have been no inconsiderable section of timid middle-class opinion to which the best that might be expected from a Socialist government was non-activity . RAMSAY MACDONALD and his associates ? so reassurance ran ? could n't begin to do what they wanted . Englishmen are now applauding MACDONALD and his associates for being up and doing every minute of the day . Merely by the amount of motion through space there has not been in Great Britain in the memory of man such a Cabinet of hustlers . Chancellor of the Exchequer SNOWDEN has been to The Hague and back  --  not a long journey measured in miles , but as exciting as the same distance over a Coney Island roller coaster . Foreign Secretary HENDERSON has traveled to The Hague and Geneva . J. H. THOMAS , in charge of unemployment . has just returned from a commercial trip to Canada. , Chief of all ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready to supplement his rapid air shuttlings between Scotland and Downing Street with a trip across the Atlantic . Like every ather employer , the British taxpayer can not help being pleased by such a display of energy on the job . Contrary to the general assumption , even taxpayers are human . Like farmers clamoring for relief , they will not always insist on results . The British public is fully as much pleased by . Labor hustle after Mr. BALDWIN 'S policy of wait-and-see as by the fruits of such hustle . It is hard to say which has caused more gratification ? Mr. SNOWDEN 'S bringing home the bacon in the form of a couple of million pounds annually or his bringing home an enemy scalp or two . Mr. HENDERSON is credited in London with hastening allied evacuation on the Rhine ; but such a move was everywhere accepted as bound to follow automatically on the acceptance of the Young Plan . A London cartoon shows Mr. J. H. THOMAS , in the beginning regarded as the strongest man in the Cabinet , coming back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no less than three other colleagues . Is the remarkable outburst of activity under MACDONALD to be explained in part by the spirit of emulation among the Ministers ? That involves no personal discredit and spells good for the State . But it must be something more than that . The Cabinet did n't simply happen to be on its toes when the whistle sounded . There is a calculated  --  and legitimate  --  strategy behind ' the speed and snap with which the government has been doing things , of which the objective is the enhanced prestige of the Labor party . The Young Plan could have been set into motion without the Snowden manner . The evacuation of the Rhine could have been hastened under any British Foreign Secretary . Arrangements for selling British coal to Canadian railroads could have been made without Mr. THOMAS 'S personal salesmanship . But it does not hurt Great Britain , and it helps the British Labor party , if a good bit of drama is injected into the record .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
