txt The three American navy officers , Lieutenants Hinton , Kloor and Farrell , who abandoned their wrecked balloon near Moose Factory on the shore of James Bay on Dec. 14 , are ? due in Mattice tomorrow afternoon about " 4 o'clock . Earl TroWz , one of the runners sent out by newspaper correspondents to give advance notice of their coming , arrived here at 10 o'clock tonight and reported that the party , with all members in good shape , had made a camp for the night at Skunk Island , . twenty miles from here on . the Missanibi River . Trowz , . who made a trip of eighteen miles over the heavy trail in five hours , was two miles south of Skunk Island at 5 o'clock this afternoon when W. R. Clarke , leader of the correspondents ' expedition , came rushing to him as fast as his snowshoes could carry him and directed him to make all speed for Mattice with the announcement . Clarke did not stop to tell him any details beyond , the facts that all members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp at the island , and might be expected in lattice about 4 in the afternoon . Met Indian Runner . Clarke reached Mattite . at 11 o'clock tonight and had nothing to add to Trowz 's Story except to explain that ho did not personally see the party , bat had learned of their whereabouts from an Indian runner who had pushed on ahead of the Americans to break the trail . ? Earlier in the night a message was received from Clarke from the hands of an Indian who said Clarke then was five and one-half miles south of Skunk Island . It had snowed hard here all day today and the flakes were whipped by a freezing breeze . The fliers ' failure to appear had given rise to uneasiness rather than anxiety ' here . This little settlement had every confidence in the ability . of the Hudson 's Bay Company to get its mail packet train through to the railhead , and it was such a train , though one of unusual proportions , that was bringing back Lieutenants Hinton , Kloor and Farrell . Clarke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runner , reported that the going was very heavy , and expressed the opinion that the aeronauts might not be out before Thursday . His , message read : " Fifty miles down river ; no signs of party yet ; going very heavy . We are giving Clairmont a great chase . Will advise when reach track . Had to hire Indians to take this out and get more grub . W. R. CLARKE . " Had Gone to Meet Balloonists . The Clairmont to whom the message referred is Abkik Clairmont , a Cochrane lawyer , who was sent into the bush with Indian guides and a dog train a week ago tomorrow to meet the returning travelers . The Indian who brought out the message was Dave Sa.gabishcome , a Cree , who left his hut at Cabbage Island ( twenty miles north of Mattice ) . He was bringing out his two children who are to be sent to the Indian Industrial Sohool maintained by the Dominion Government at Chapleau , Ontario . The youngsters and their father made the twenty miles in two days on snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sagabishcome agreed with Clarke that the going was bad , particua larly for tenderfeet , because of soft snow and ' fitfully thawing weather . Sagabishcome said Clarke and his Indians were encamped at Kettle Portage ( Akik the Indians call it ) , but he was unable to say whether the party had penetrated further north and had returned . So far as can be learned from Indians and the handful of white men who live here , a company packet train never had come to serious grief and there was no reason to believe this one had met with any mishap . Another reassuring fact in connection with the delayed appearance of the wanderers was ' that In the trains was a cariole for Lieutenant Farrell , who suffered most severely of any of the party . This sled with its big sides is heavy and slow , and if it has been necessary for the oldest of the three officers to ride all the way it naturally would follow that the journey would be a slow one . Interest in the return of the unwilling sub-arctic explorers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formality has dwindled to an intormality , the secret service agent in question explaining that it would be useless to ask fool questions when all the world already knows the balloonists came down because it would have been suicide to try to stay up . Meantime comes word first of the - publication of letters from Lieutenant Hinton to his wife giving an account of the harrowing time the three had in the frozen forest , and then the announcement that Secretary Daniels would order a court of inquiry to determine whether Lieut . Farrell , justly has been placed in a bad light in the Hinton communications . While Indians now here reported that Farrell , when Toni Marks met the party in the woods , was very near exhausted and had fallen several times on the trail , now word has ' come of actions on his part , which are interpreted here as representing him as having , to a degree , lost his grip on himself . Among the correspondents , official welcomers and others in the small party awaiting the return of the airmen the keenest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other when the fact that the letters were published is disclosed to them . Also there is much anxiety as to whether Secretary Daniels 's order to the men instructing them not to talk will dperate to keep them from clearing up all doubts as to their conduct in the forest the moment they arrive . The feeling here is that things have reached such a state it would be most unfortunate if . needless time were lost in making clear and certain just what happened in the bush . Particularly is this true of the Americans in Mattice , who are eagerly hopeful that both the publication of Lieut . Hinton 's personal letters to his wife and the Intimations in them that Lieut . Farrell was a less hardy and copfident traveler than the others will receive a pleasant denouncement when the airmen once ? tore are in communication with the world and can speak for themselves . The belief here is that this adventure of the Americans in a foreign country should not , through mistaken secrecy , be allowed to generate into anything approaching a scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ' not get in today are the Indians who brought from Moose Factory the last packet train and Kloor 's message , which was the first intimation that the balloonists Were alive , long after hope for them had been abandoned . All these Indians who were able to talk English met and talked with the Americans , and they had hoped to witness their triumphant return to what is described here in a comparative sense as civilization . The return mail to the James Bay Post can no longer be delayed , however , and the Indians will start on their 200-mile trek northward tomorrow morning , unless there is a snowstorm . With the train tomorrow goes J. G. Mayer , a Scotchman , who for eleven years has been factor at the Hudson Bay kompany post on Great Whale River , on the east side of Hudson Bay . This is the second time Mayer has been in a country of white men during his company service . He came this time to get married , and is leaving his wife at Port Arthur , Ontario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mayer ' , will not reach the home , where he is the only white person , until next March , and it ? will be September when the trading company supply ship Nascopie reaches Great Whale River before he learns the outcome of his wife 's experience . Mayer expressed himself as quite contented with his job as factor in the northern wilderness at about $25 a Week Though he did not learn of the war until six months after it started and had no iokling ? how the Entente was making out until six months later ; he said he had no interest in news and did n't mind hearing from the outside world only twice a year , provided he was able to keep well informed as to the fur Market . The Scotchman will accompany the packet train to Moose Factory . Then he will journey on over the rough coastal ice , keeping inside or outside the fringe of islands hi lower Hudson Bay , according to conditions on the trail , until he reaches Ruppert House . From there he will proceed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up there and take him to East Main River where his own dogs will Meet him and take him back to Great Whale River . Talking of his work today leaver said he liked dealing with the Eskimos who people his territory in Northern Quebec much better than- trading with the . Indians to the southward , though the Indians themselves are somewhat given to describing the Eskimos " the Fall people . " Maver 's trading is all in goods , particularly ? food and moleskin which he exchanges for the hair seals , polar bear , martin and other skins which the hunters and trappers haul to the poet on their dog sleds . Caribou Have Disappeared . He said there no longer were any caribou in his country , though once they had been plentiful , and beaver were not found at all because low willows along the coast and some distance inland and moss about the water holes were the only signs , of vegetation . The huge mammals which gave the river its name are almost never found , though Mayer showed a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The Great Whale River factor said that while moose never came as far north as his post and deer were shot only occasionally , and then well to the eastward , the Indians who ' inhabit the territory just below him had shot five moose in the last three years . In each case , he said , the Indian who killed a moose died soon afterward , and now the Indians of the whole region believe a blight is cast upon any one who slays one of the animals , Old will not touch them for any inducement . The factor said the only time he ever had any ' trouble at his post was the year of his arrival , when an epidemic of measles swept the ' tribe , proving to be mom destroping than the flu : For weeks he- was busy as parson and undertaker disposing of the dead . Writing of this factor 's dealing with the Eskimos calls to mind the different methods employed by the trading company with the Indians . They have become too sophisticated to trade altogether in goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company advances the money , often large sums , to keep them going in Summer and in Winters when the trapping is poor , and the Indians themselves say most of them are never out of the concern 's debt and hence never are able to save anything . They speak in cordial terms of the ancient company 's care of them , but bemoan their financial condition . Sam Sainsbury of Toronto , who describes himself as an explorer , started on the trail this morning with a motionpicture operator from Toronto and a charioteer to handle the ten dogs attached ' to the two sleds comprising his outfit . Sainsbury , . while admitting his aid had not been solicited , said he was going to " rescue " - the airmen and bring them in with his fresher dogs , an assertion which aroused the indignation of the Hudson Bay Company people , who said they did not need any volunteer helpers . The Toronto man brought his sleds and dogs with him .. The Indians did n't like the dogs because they odd they were n't real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the firm ice further north . Sainsbury 's first breakdown occurred 200 yards from his starting point on the railroad track . His second Was a few miles out from Mattice , where Sagabishcome , when he came in with his , children and Clarke 's message found ' him late this evening . Special to The New York Times .
