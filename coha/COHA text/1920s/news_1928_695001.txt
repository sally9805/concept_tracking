txt The protests against high taxes in Chicago resulted Sn official action from two sources yesterday . The first came from William H. Malone , chairman of the state tax commission , after he had been notified by C. C. Carnahan , attorney for the board of assessors , tnat he had advised that board to publish the tax valuations on all real estate by house and street number . If those pu'dished lists show , as all evidence indicates , that there have been gross inequalities in tax valuations , " said Mr. Malone , " the state tax commission will order a reassessment of all property , regardless of the time , trouble and expense involved . " C. 0 . Fairweather of the University of Chicago charges that one part of the real estate owners in Chicago pays $30,000,000 a year more than their just share of the taxes in order that another part of the property owners may be saved $30,000,000 in tax payments . Action in City Council . The other attack came in a resolution presented to the city council by Ald. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking a conference to devise a plan for reducing governmental expenditures . To this conference he would invite the school board , county board , drainage board , park boards , and the chairman of the house and senate committees on appropriations . Both of those moves suggested remedies looking to the future. , Neither of them relieves taxpayers of their present payments . Those taxpayers flooded the county building yesterday . - There were so many of them in the morning that one-third of the crowd .. could not even get inside of the collector 's office . They jammed the con , riders , blockading the entrances , jos-1 tling , shoving , and pushing around until they became tired and angry . - The bickering and quarreling be ' tween the taxpayers and the 30 deputy , sheriffs who were trying to preserve order threatened at one time to de , ' velop physical trouble . One out of every four taxpayers had a ' chip on his shoulder and indignation on his . tongue . Many of the. , hecklers were women . Women Heckle Clerks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crowding by 200 waiting and weary taxpayers who had been unable to get inside of the office . " There go two fat , bloated grafters to spend our money for their lunch , yelled one woman . That is a. mild sample of the comments . ' The only hope of relief from present bills was suggested yesterday by the taxation committee of the Cook county real-estate board . It obtained an opinion from Its lawyer , Austin L. Wayman . Ills suggestions offer aid to a very small minority . " Such taxpayers as filed or had filed with the board of review complaints against valuations placed by ' the board of assessors , " suggests Mr. - Wayman , " can pay such portion of their taxes as they deem equitable ; and on application for judgment along tively by a responsible official of the county collector 's office that ! tome must be paid before midnight of May 1-to avoid the penalty of one per cent a month . It was represented ' that was the legal view of Schuyler &; Weinfeld , attorneys for County Collector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . to a lawyer from Schityler &; Weinfeld 's office yesterday . The collector is proceeding on the theory that the written . opinion will conform to the oral view previously expressed by his lawyers . A little more than $29,000,000 has been collected in taxes to date this year , as compared with $42,000,000 on the same day last year . The big payers , as usual , are waiting until the last day before handing in their checks . Taxing Bodies Bombardel . The rooms of the board of assessors and the board of review were well filled all day yesterday with persons complaining and protesting against high taxes . Except where obvious clerical error has been made , neither hoard has the power to do anything . The persistent protests have put all of the board me'mbors on edge . Their position in general is that there has been a widespread plea for equalization of valuations , and they save increased values accordingly , no that the ' valt'lations now are fairer than before in  --  recent years . But members of tho assessing bodies are tell.Ing hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the , taxexpending bodies , the city , school board , park boards , sanitary dig . trict , forest preserve district , and others , It is claimed that the equalization of values for taxing purposes neither raises nor lowers taxes . That feat is accomplished by the levies demanded by the tax expending bodies . Carry Complaints to Aldermen . Many taxpayers have carried their stories to aldermen who are up for reelection next spring , Unless the tax feeling dies down in the meantime or promise of reduction of the burden . is made , it appears that some aldermen may have difficulty in being reelected . alas is said to be the motive underlying the council resolution of yesterday calling for . a conference of tax spenders to find a way to reduce taxes , One of the chief causes of increased taxes , so far as tax expending bodies influence it , is the city government itself . The city taxes levied to be collected this year are $12,000,000 more than last year by the most favorable method of reckoning . By a method which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year are $15 , - 000,000 ! more than those levied last year . Of ' Course it can be explained that all of the increase is not for current corporate . expenses , but , it is pointed Out , the tax payer must settle regardless of the particular purpose for which the taxes have been levied . The council finance committee at its session on Thursday was confronted with the need for $1410,000 more revenue , on Its own method of reckoning . It was revealed that the city through an oversight had neglected to levy all it could last year by about $1,800,000 . That . " slip " will probably not be made next year . However , the taxi increase ' for the city is only about 20 per cent , while that of the Sanitary district is over 50 per cent . The sanitary board is trying to collect $6,000,000 more this year than last year .
