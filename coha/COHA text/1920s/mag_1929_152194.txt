David Herbert Lawrence , bearded son of a miner and of letters , has often shocked his native England with the pagan implications of his novels ( Sons and Lovers , Women in Love ) . His most recent tale , Lady Chatterley 's Lover , he thought best to publish privately , stealthily . But officialdom soon learned of its existence , found the book so concupiscent that it was forever banned from England . <P> Last week , while its author sunned himself in Italy with sophisticated and sympathetic Novelist-Essayist Aldous Leonard Huxley , news came that another Lawrence venture had riled English moralists . In London since mid-June there has been a first exhibition of Mr. Lawrence 's adventures into painting . Two titles were typical : A Boccaccio Story , A Flight with An Amazon . Thousands of Londoners have seen them . Critics have snorted : " Repellent and distorted nudes . . . compel most spectators to recoil in horror . " <P> Last week a troop of detectives swooped down upon the gallery , made off with a dozen Lawrence nudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sculptor Jacob Epstein . Born by the Hudson , he has done most of his controversial carving beside the Thames ( TIME , June 1 , 1925 ) . Sculptor Epstein 's recent London exhibition of drawings also included many an explicit nude . Englishmen came , saw , said various things , but there was no official interference . <P> Last week , however , Sculptor Epstein heard that 200 books elegantly illustrating the exhibition , designed to sell in the U. S. at $90 per copy , had been seized by U. S. authorities , sent to Washington , pronounced " unfit for circulation . " <P> " Now is n't that silly ? " said Sculptor Epstein . <P> He had more to say when he read adverse criticisms of Night , his newly-unveiled ornament on the London Underground office building . One pundit had observed : <P> " It has no psychological significance whatever . It is a great , coarse object in a debased Indo-Chinese style , representing a creature half-Buddha , half-mummy , bearing upon her knee a corpselike child of enormous size . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street does not like the look of it on his daily way to work he can always avert his eyes . In any case , the artist who considers the taste of the masses is a fool and is stultifying his own art . . . . In all beauty there is an element of strangeness , of unfamiliarity , which ordinary , non-creative people find alarming . . . . In my Night there is a touch of the inhuman . That is appropriate to the vast , vague idea of night . You could not personify such an idea by an ordinary pretty human figure . "
