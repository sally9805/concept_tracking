" Red-hot , " " redheaded " Winston Churchill , ultra-reactionary Chancellor of the British Exchequer , alarmist par excellence , hurled defiance at the Soviet government last week in terms so abusive as to make a diplomatic protest from Russia all but inevitable . <P> Before an audience in London he literally shouted : <P> " I hope I shall live to see the day when either there will be a civilized government in Russia or when we shall have ended this present pretense of friendly relations with men who are seeking our overthrow . . . . " What folly Lloyd George committed when he brought these Russian intriguers into our midst ! . . . " I have to add this warning . Persons who lend money to Russia , as they are entitled to do , must be alive to the risks they run and understand that , in no circumstances , will the British Treasury accept any responsibility if they are defrauded . " <P> This tirade followed a reply by the Soviet government to Britain 's note of protest ( TIME , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government itself of funds to support striking British workers . Like the British note the Soviet reply was couched in mild terms . The Soviet government denied that it had sent the funds in question , but refused to take steps to prevent its closely interlocked labor organizations from sending " Red gold " to Britain . <P> Mr. Churchill 's outburst jibed ill with a statement by Home Secretary Sir William ( " Jix " ) Joynson-Hicks to the Commons that " the Government does not propose to terminate its official protest by renouncing the Anglo-Russian trade agreement-nor does the Government propose to stop any Russian money sent to aid the coal miners . . . . The total sum so transmitted now amounts to 380,000 ( $1,900,000 ) . " <P> Transparently the Baldwin Cabinet is badly strained over its attitude toward Russia . Ministers Churchill , Joynson-Hicks and Lord Birkenhead , ultra - Conservatives , reputedly did all in their power last week to induce Foreign Minister Chamberlain , Premier Baldwin and other cool heads to " stop selling British pots to Bolshevik cannibals . " <P> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal abuse which it will tolerate from a British minister .
