MIDDLETOWN " . i is in one of the North East Central States , well within the holders of the prosperous area It is a city of some 40,000 , a brisk manufacturing center surrounded by corn fields . It is not a one-industry town , but makes automobile accessories , glass , and metal products . Native white Americans of native parentage compose 85 per cent of the population . In 1885 the town was a placid county seat of some 6,000 souls , still retaining much of the simplicity of pioneer days . Industry meant a bagging plant , a clay-tile yard , a feather-duster shop , a planing mill , and a flour mill or two . Middletown consumed perhaps half of all that it produced . Today , save for the building trades , not 1 per cent of what Middletown makes is locally consumed . The output of its factories departs for the ends of the earth , and the whole world contributes to its supply of food , shelter , and clothing . Out of every 100 people in the city : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 are home-making ( housewives and helpers ) . 19 are in school . 15 are dependents  --  the very old , the disabled , and the children under six . The gainfully employed of Middletown engage in more than 400 different occupations . Seventy-one in a hundred belong to the working class and work mainly with their hands ; twenty-nine belong to the business class Twenty-seven per cent of the working class live in houses valued at $2,500 or less . Such a house the Lynds have graphically described . There are 2,500 of them , out of the 9,200 homes in the town . The poorer workingman coming home after his nine and a half hours on the job walks up the frequently unpaved street , turns in at a bare yard littered with a rusty velocipede or worn-out automobile tires , opens a sagging door , and enters the living-room of his house . From the room the whole house is visible  --  the kitchen with table and floor swarming with flies and often strewn with bread crusts , orange skins , torn papers , and lumps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilts falling off the beds . . . . The whole interior is musty with stale odors of food , clothing , and tobacco . . . . A baby in wet , dirty clothes crawls about the bare floor among odd pieces of furniture . I would guess that 25 per cent of all American workers ? say five million men  --  are coming home to just such sights and smells , and wet , crawling babies today . " In another very dirty house almost totally without furniture the housewife was at work at an electric washing machine . " The fact that a house has an electric washing machine  --  or a radio , or a Ford  --  does not mean that it is prosperous It may only ? This is the second in a series of seven articles on American Prosperity The third will appear in the issue of November 13 - EDITOR THE NATION See " Middletown , " by Robert S Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd Harcourt , Brace and Companymean that the local washing-machine salesman is an expert at his trade . Moving up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inhabited chiefly by skilled workmen and clerks , we find a tidy front yard , coarse lace curtains , a name plate on the door . The living-room is hard and bright , with pink-flowered rug , shiny oak furniture , and a sewing machine in the corner . Almost all the equipment has been bought on the instalment plan . In the 2,000 houses valued at $4,500 to $7,000 live head bookkeepers , small-store proprietors , school-teachers , and the lower ranks of the business group . It is a battle ground of forced choices  --  between a hardwood floor or a much-needed rug ; music lessons or a Y. M. C. A. camp for the children . The houses are larger but not so shiny as in the last group . Finally we reach the 600 houses of the upper-business class  --  valued at $7,500 or more . Everything from the bittersweet in the flower-holder to the mahogany smoking-table by the over-stuffed davenport bespeaks correctness . A sleeping porch is as mandatory as the cocktail shaker . An electric refrigerator purrs from time to time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second floor . The size of the standard building plot is growing smaller , leaving less room for children to play , less privacy , more noise . Flowers and shrubs must give ground to driveway and garage . " The make of one 's car is rivaling the looks of one 's place , as evidence of one 's belonging . " Furnaces are increasing in number but " most of the working class still live in the base-burner and unheated-bedroom era . " All new houses , except the very cheapest , have bathrooms , and in many old houses they are being installed . But in January , 1925 , one in four of all the city 's dwellings lacked running water and an even higher percentage still used the old-fashioned backyard privy . No less than 99 per cent of the houses in the town are wired for electricity . So much for Middletown 's houses . Is it a picture false to the overwhelming majority of the towns and cities of America ? I believe not . Only in the dozen or so great cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different situation . In Megalopolis the lawns , porches , and gardens are not only getting smaller , they have completely disappeared . At a rough guess , there are about 27,000,000 homes in America . They are now ( 1928 ) equipped with : 18,000,000 bathtubs 15,300,000 electric flat irons 6,828,000 vacuum cleaners 5,000,000 washing machines 4,900,000 electric fans 4,540,000 electric toasters 2,600,000 electric heaters 755,000 electric refrigerators 348,000 ironing machines . The supersalesmen have still a few days ' work ahead of them . By and large these national figures check with the Middletown close-up . The space in which the average American makes his home grows smaller and mechanical equipment somewhat greater . It is doubtful if his home is as truly comfortable as it was in 1890 . But he has running water , a bathtub , electric lights , probably a radio and telephone  --  which make it a cleaner , better-lighted , more strenuous , and far noisier home . In this era of house furnaces , heated office buildings , and inclosed automobiles , the importance of clothing as protection for the body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records for May 22 , 1891 : " Changed my flannels for cotton this morning . " May , mind you ! Today flannel underwear is as obsolete as the frock coat . The Middletown housewife used to do her morning 's work in a shirtwaist with high collar and long sleeves , a wool skirt over a flannel petticoat , over her second-best corset . Today the standard dress for a high-school girl is a brassiere , knickers , knee-length dress , low shoes , and silk stockings ; nor does mother , or even grandmother , ask for much more . Men still cover the body modestly from chin to soles , but women are rolling up from below , down from above , and in from the sides . In summer , men wear four times as much clothes by weight as women . Fewer clothes are being made at home . A dry-goods merchant estimates that he sold five bolts of cloth in 1890 for every bolt that now goes over his counter . As a result women 's clothes cost far more per pound than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the budget has been balanced in part by the decline in yardage . Women demand less cotton , wool , linen  --  which is a saving . The margin is eaten up by silk , rayon , furs , more processing , variety , color , and style . From 1919 to 1927 , rayon consumption increased from nine million to ninety-six million pounds . Aesthetically and hygienically , American women are better dressed , and the cost is not much greater . The effect of the new " siren " fashions remains to be seen . We come now to the last of the three great human staples  --  food . Here , too , weight is giving way to variety . Today Middletown , together with the whole country , is buying fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the year . The orange which used to make a Christmas gift for the children 's stockings is now a daily necessity . Refrigeration , cold storage , and rapid transportation have all but banished the " winter diet , " and with it " spring sickness . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be ; canned foods have come in by the million cases ; baker 's bread has worsted the kitchen oven ; the delicatessen store has undermined no small part of the housewife 's skill . Yet by and large , we eat a better-balanced ration today , to which the decline in sickness and the longer life-span figures in part bear witness . Mr. Leo Wolman finds that gross calorie intake is declining ( energy units ) , and with it cereal and meat consumption , while fruit , vegetable , and milk consumption is growing . Low-priced staples richin calories are giving way to high-priced foods poor in calories . The consumption of sugar also is increasing  --  in spite of the slogans of the American Tobacco Company . Food costs are creeping up because of more variety , fewer family gardens , longer hauls , bigger terminals , more competitive advertising , and hand-to-mouth buying in small packages . In brief , the era of prosperity  --  and also the years immediately before 1922 ? have brought a better-balanced , more nourishing diet , more variety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , less home cooking , more restaurant eating , and higher food costs . ( While retail prices as a whole have moved but little since 1922 , food prices are tending upward . ) Finally , as Mr. Wolman points out after his exhaustive studies , it would be a great mistake to conclude that malnutrition has been banished by American prosperity . It still obtains over great areas  --  particularly in the South  --  but it is not quite the scourge it used to be . The first internal-combustion automobile appeared in Middletown in 1900 . By 1906 there were probably 200 in the county . At the close of 1923 there were 6,221 passenger cars in the city , or roughly two for every three families . " As , at the turn of the century , business class people began to feel apologetic if they did not have a telephone , so ownership of an automobile has now reached the point of being an accepted essential of normal living . " Homes are mortgaged to buy a car . A local finance company estimates that 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of twenty-six families without bathroom facilities in the working-class group studied , twenty-one had automobiles . Here we have a new habit cutting in ahead of an older one . To be speedy and dirty is better than to be clean and stationary . Each year about 4,000,000 new cars come snorting upon the highways of the republic , and 2,000,000 battered veterans seek their last resting place  --  mainly in ditches beside the highway . In an urban community in 1928 buyers of passenger cars were classified thus : Per cent Superintendents , foremen , salesmen , clerks 30 Laborers , artisans , firemen , motormen .... . . 29 Manufacturers , merchants , professional people 27 Housewives and sundry 14 100 Of these cars 61.4 per cent were bought on the instalment plan , and 38.6 per cent for cash . Not the least of the reverberations of the automobile has been the enormous number of new jobs which it has created ; jobs which were non-existent in the economy of 1900 . A recent estimate shows nearly four million of them-795,000 in factories making vehicles , tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garages and service stations , on highways , in oilfields , in selling , and insurance . The automobile calls for tour million workers for jobs entirely unknown twenty-five years ago Do you wonder that I class the motor car as the outstanding Why of prosperity ? By way of summary and conclusion , it will be well to enumerate again the specific goods , services , and qualities which comprise the new American standard of living . It is not a list which all possess but to which all aspire  --  or almost all .

The schedule does not come so far from balancing out  --  particularly after the six billions of instalment credit is allowed for . We have not so much moved forward as done a side shift , crabwise . Study the changes listed earlier . Do they show progress or decline , or tit for tat ? Personally I believe they do show , on the whole , a margin of progress , with ups and downs in individual items . The final appraisal I leave for a later article .

It has been reliably estimated that in 1920 some 80 per cent of American families lived below the budget of health and decency as compiled by the United States Department of Labor , and priced at about $2,000 . ' ' Per capita income has increased nearly 20 per cent during the era of prosperity , bringing more families above the modest budget , but leaving the bulk of them still below it . By no stretch of the imagination can the average American be said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty per cent would hardly raise him to an adequate supply of the prime essentials . He has bought an automobile because his heart yearned for it and the instalment system made it possible .
