The winding roads that run through the smiling hills near Dover , N. J. , were populated with sadness ; no laughter broke through the stillness ; even the pudgy children , bronzed as rust , trotted , wondrously solemn , beside their stolid Slavic folk . Short-statured women , sunburned , stocky men , trudged ploddingly , bewilderedly , home . Whispers . Tears . Vague muddle . <P> Two weeks ago shattering explosions had prostrated their cottages , snorted through their gardens , shells from the lightning-struck U. S. arsenal mutilating kin , pigs , treasures . ( TIME , July 19 . ) <P> Over at the arsenal crawling soldiers and marines had squirmed through the charred ashes of leveled buildings , grasses , companions . Any moment a shell might explode , but most of the firing had ceased after 48 hours . Here a marine sifted , and as the grit drizzled through his sieve , he spied a black , circular object . A ring . Spattered on his shoes lay the reliquae of a ghost . Over in Brooklyn , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not identify dismembered legs with fingerprints . The bodies had been found thick around the first powder magazine which exploded - bodies of heroic soldiers who had defied an exploding arsenal with water buckets . Little metal knicknacks were pondered on with shrugging shoulders . Unidentified . Meanwhile , other Navy committees investigate God 's act . <P> In the villages refugee gentry told : " Before we knew it the explosion came and blew out our windows . Glass cut me , and my wife 's face was crimson with cuts . . . . Our baby was knocked to the floor and killed by a falling chunk of wood . . . . My son has lost his sight , my daughter was lacerated . . . . Blood was pouring from a dozen wounds in my back made by small pieces of shrapnel . " <P> Perhaps 900 refugees in all were whipped from their homes by the tornado of shell fire , ambushed by " duds , " harried by whining bullets . <P> The reports of the committees investigating the disaster have not yet been published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the magazines under ground , where danger would have been minimized ? Can they discount the contention of Professor Pupin of Columbia University , as given by Hearst-Editor Brisbane , that sheet copper roofings connected by huge copper bands directly with wet earth would have frustrated even this " act of God ? " The system of lightning rod protectors at Lake Denmark is obviously inefficient . The Government controls immense voltages of electricity at Niagara Falls ; why have not engineers sought a method to control electrical attacks on the concentrated sudden death at Dover ? Were the officials negligent in permitting habitation near the arsenal ? Will new storage plants be situated at Dover ? Will serious attempt be made to safeguard them against lightning ? Will the 21 other arsenals along the U. S. seacoasts and borders be modernized ?
