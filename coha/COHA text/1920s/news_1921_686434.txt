txt We have got to have a State Government administered by people who are willing to cp-operate with the head of the State Government and with the Legislature in producing an economical and efficient administration . There wo n't be anybody in the State Administration while I am at the head of it , if I can help it , who is not willing to do that . Such is the remorseless general notice served by Governor MILLER on all State departments , bureaus , agencies and officeholders . It was served in the Course , of a severe examination and reproof of two Republican members of the State Hospital Commis ; ion . The Legislative Finance Committees , paring down by some $80 , - 000,000 the budget 's request , took the liberty of reducing the commission 's estimate by some $2,100,000 . In March there was still incredulous surprise at ; Albany . This talk about economy was all very well in the campaign , but surely the Governor did n't mean it literally . Departments ' and institutions had a prime indispensable sacred purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to " leaders . " The dread proposal to decollate 2,000 officeholders could n't be serious . At least a plea for more money and jobs in the State insane asylums would have a deep sentimental public value . The two Republican Commissioners published to the world their criticisms of the Legislature for its stinginess to the State hospitals-for the insane . Commissioner HIGGINS was brought into the Senate to testify that there should be at least one employe for every eight patients in an asylum to insure proper care . He took occasion to say that " the only real obstacle " to an efficient administration of the " hospitals " was found in the Appropriation bill with its reductions . Governor MILLER called Mr. HIGGINS and his Republican associate , Dr. PILGRIM , before him . He subjected them to a rigid examination and cross-examination . He proved that they had more than money enough for the reasonable expenses of their departments . He showed that the Legislature had allowed one physician for every 200 patients , a higher rate than had obtained in the last eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know , " he asked them , " that " the State Government could not " raise taxes high enough and fast " enough to run the State unless the " legislative committees held depart " ments down to reasonable expend ! - " tures ? And in your ease the Legis " lature did even better than last " year . " Their public criticism of the Legislature and their opposition to the economy policy were improper . He gave them their choice between resigning or appearing before him on Thursday to show cause why they should n't be removed . The high character and excellent intentions of these gentlemen are beyond doubt , but plainly the servants of the State must give up the long-treasured notion that the State purse is illimitable and that economy is only a campaign catchword . Governor MILLER meant economy when he said economy . Any officeholder who wo n't co-operate with him in bringing about economy must get out . Hopelessness must be beginning to succeed wonder in the minds of the Republican bosslets . There is a rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GROVER CLEVELAND . The Republican politicians have found a master .
