( See front cover ) <P> He stands full six feet tall . No brittle yellowman he , but broad and bronzed and bland . Bible in hand or coat pocket . Pistol within arms reach . Devout Christian . Dead shot . Master of the world 's largest private army-195,000 men . Such today is China 's Strongest Man : Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang , pronounced " Fung U-sheeang . " <P> Recently the major northern cities of Peking and Tientsin were captured by Feng 's troops ( TIME , June 18 , 25 ) ; but last week he ostentatiously eschewed the role of Conqueror . With a gesture that smacked of authentic greatness the Broad Bronzed Marshal left a part of his victorious forces in the field and modestly withdrew to Honan Province , central China . <P> Friends of Feng-and he has many , white , yellow-hailed him as renouncing personal glory and proving the sincerity of his professed devotion to a great ideal : Nationalism or the Unification of China under a People 's Government . That ideal in concrete form is at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feng sometime since pledged the voluntary support and subordination of himself and his immense , completely independent army . In the name of the Nationalist Government Peking and Tientsin were conquered . <P> " BUT , " say in effect the enemies of Feng-and they are many , white , yellow , - " But really , you know , Feng has conquered those same cities before , in so many other names . . . . Feng 's a traitor , a Judas ! Of course the Missionaries like him . He 's the only Chinese War Lord they ever converted . But watch out for Feng ! He gets his arms from Moscow , got 27,000,000 cartridges . He 'll ditch the Nationalists yet and keep Peking for himself . " <P> Happily the Strongest man seemed , last week , on the point of wiping from his scutcheon the stain of treachery . Despatches reported him in complete harmony with the new regime , said that he and the onetime Nationalist Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek would shortly go to Peking and there jointly celebrate the union of all China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Past . Though nearly all journalistic historians of modern China explicitly describe Feng as a " traitor , " . the Christian Marshal 's missionary friends continued , last week , indignant at the adjective . The peculiar reasoning by which the missionary mind arrives at a conclusion opposed to the journalistic has seldom been better exemplified than by Miss Luella Miner of the Shantung Christian University , who wrote last week : " I challenge anyone to point to any ' cause ' or superior officer or associate whom Marshal Feng has ' deserted ' or ' betrayed ' that has not been discredited later by those who did not have the vision and courage to do it when Feng gained unpopularity by his ' treachery ' . " <P> Such logic , profoundly philosophical , is unanswerable . Men with the vision to betray superiors who are later ruined and discredited , have not seldom achieved that universal esteem which may soon be the portion of Feng Yu-hsiang.
