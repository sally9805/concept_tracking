A one-inch advertisement and a brief publicity notice appeared in New York City newspapers one day last week announcing the return of a famed young woman . A year ago the shrug of her well-rounded shoulders was worth a big black headline . But that was history by which many a newspaper profited and was shamed . Last week 's item was that Mrs. Frances Heenan ( " Peaches " ) Browning went on the stage of the vast Keith-Albee Hippodrome in uptown Manhattan . Adequately clothed , she sang briefly and badly in a vaudeville act , introduced by a sleek whippersnapper . To a few newsgatherers in her dressing room , Mrs. Browning talked intelligently , familiarly ; referred to her onetime husband as impersonally as to a street car conductor . " What 's the old man doing now ? " queried she . He has be-become comparatively obscure , has attempted to contribute to the letter columns of various dailies . But she has been traveling the " big time " vaudeville circuit , from coast to coast , during the last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
