txt Financial interests say Henry Ford is determined to assert his independence of the banking community and go it alone . Investment hankers , it is said here in financial circles , have received $15,000,000 in securities from Ford 's private box with directions to sell them . Ford has also renewed the $25,000,000 loans remaining from the $100,000,000 he borrowed when he bought out his partnon . How much Henry Ford has in his box , no one knows . Sonic people doubt whether he has kept any accurate record of his own assets or all his liabilities , The best local estimate of Mr. Ford 's box is $25,000,000 , although some people estimate that he has as high as $45,000,000 in securities outside of the Ford company . The December sales income of the Ford company was $12,000,000 gross including part renewals . Sales at this rate will not carry the overhead of the plant . Mr. Ford has made his prices too low for a reduced volume of business . It is estimated here by people familiar with the books and details of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars a day to carry the overhead and manufacturing cost . This is withaut any profit , or reduction in the indebtedness , or anything for taxes . In other words , the plant can not be profitably operated at one-half its capacity . Indeed the whole Ford organization and distributive system is planned on a basis of maximum speed . The business is now very irregular , but sales arc making in spots over the country . If the organization can be held together , the manufacture of replacement parts alone should carry the whole organization with more than $25 , - 000,000 a year profit . The supply parts alone had a peak profits point of $50,000,000 per annum . The Ford dealers are not allowed to supply parts manufactured by any other than the Ford company . But to keep the Ford distributing system going , there must be a fair output of cars paying profits to the distributors . It is said that Mr. Ford has worked his dealers to the limit . They have given him a circulation for the Dearborn Independent of 293,000 . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanks to fill up . Of . course the Ford dealers , whether Jew or Gentile , promptly sent in their checks for $100 , per hundred blanks and then had their Ford customers fill in the blanks . In other ' words , the Ford dealers have paid for the circulation of the Dearborn Independent . It is exactly this situation that the country outside of Michigan cannqt understand an respects the position of Senator Newberry in Washington .. Mr. Wilson , asked Mr. Ford to be a candidate for the U. S. Senate and Ford started in the campaign with an organization worth at least one million dollars . The Republicans met it with a $250,000 q , xpenditure and won . Of course the law was transgressed on a technicality which limits money expenditures in a campaign . Ford did not have.to spend the money . He had its equivalent already in his organization through which he distributed more than 100,000 expensively made books descriptive of himself . This item is of course charge . able to the Ford business instead of the Wilson-Ford cam , paign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nations . Newberry is now denounced as the criminal but the people of Michigan do n't see it that way .
