The U. S. Debt Funding Commission announced an agreement for settling another debt . This time it is with Roumania , and the principal involved is small change as compared with the British , French or Italian debt . The original loans amounted to $36,000,000 which with interest accumulated to last June is $44,590,000 . <P> Payments are to be made on the now standard plan-over 62 years , with 3% interest for ten years and 3% thereafter . A partial moratorium is , however , provided , so that the payment for 1926 is only $200,000 and successive payments increase gradually to $2,200,000 in 1939 . <P> It took a good many days to arrive at this agreement , although there was little question of Roumania 's ability to meet the payments , and the Roumanian commissioners were evidently instructed to accept whatever were the best terms that the U. S. had to offer . <P> The Roumanians pressed for very easy payments at first because of the tangled state of their finances and the debt payments to other countries which they have to make .
