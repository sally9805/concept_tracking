RANK AND FILE-Theodore Roosevelt - Scribners ( $2.50 ) . Author-Politician Roosevelt has one excuse for his compendium of two well-known hero sagas : an attempt is vaguely made to impress the reader with the fact that a nation expresses itself fully only in war time . <P> It is amusing to watch the propaganda of the elder Roosevelt stick its head up , break out a Rooseveltian double-barreled grin , and shout " Bully ! " Balloon Buster Luke* is here not so much an aviator as one who loudly condemned our shameful inactivity prior to 1917 . <P> Ably illustrated by Captain John W. Thomason Jr. , Rank and File might interest any reader who has been denied the Sunday supplements or Liberty . <P> <P> *Lt . Frank Luke Jr. , destroyed eleven German balloons and three airplanes in four days , in September 1918 , was officially rated an ace in October , killed in November .
