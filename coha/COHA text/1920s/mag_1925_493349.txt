pursuing tears instead of laughs , they may , not excluding Chaplin , merely succeed in becoming maudlin . Buster Keaton 's dumb solemnity was perhaps more touching in his frankly comic films than in this attempt at a sentimental one . Ste/la Dallas and The Tower of Lies are two long and pretentious films of very similar character and quality . They are both rather serious attempts at the realistic presen ? tation of the tragedies of simple lives ; and neither is a real success . It is apparently more difficult for the moving pic ? tures to be convincing with themes of this kind than with almost anything else . And the only way , aside from melo ? drama , in which we can be held by a story of country life like The Tower of Lies , is by being made to believe abso ? lutely in the reality of its people . An admixture of movie theatricality is here particularly conspicuous and particularly distasteful . None the less , it is perhaps unfair to blame all the defects of The Tower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously brought great intelligence and care to the direction , or on Lon Chaney , whose prodigious vir ? tuosity can not quite save him in a role in which he seems miscast . The writer has never read the novel of Selma Lagerhif ? The Emperor of Portugallia ? upon which The Tower of Lies is based , but he remembers encountering else ? where in her writings the same mixture of poetic realism with sentimental melodrama that one finds here ; and he confesses to having suffered a similar malaise . Stella Dallas has , however , not even the advantage of a Selma Lagerltif to built upon . Though it includes some respectable elements , it is essentially a trashy moving picture based on a trashy story . I found it difficult to believe in the reality of the characters , with the exception perhaps of the young girl , played by Lois Moran , and the situations seem to me impossible . Stella Dallas , for all its touches of honest observation , is essentially an elaborate piece of hokum . An organization called the International Film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meritorious old films . They plan for the present to exhibit a different film every Sunday , afternoon and evening , in the George M. Cohan Theatre and , if the enterprise proves successful , to take a permanent theatre and show a repertoire through ? out the week . Their first picture was Deception , a Ger ? man film directed by Ernst Lubitsch . This curious and rather interesting production , made soon after the War , deals with the wives of Henry the Eighth and appears to have been inspired by a strong anti-English animus . Henry the Eighth , well done by Emil tannings , is presented as a burly beef-eating Englishman , boorish , domineering , wilful , - unscrupulous , treacherous and cruel . It is a savage treat ? ment of an historical subject of a kind unconventional for the movies and perhaps such as could only have been arrived at by the imagination of one country applied to the history of another . At one point , the atrocious Henry is seen to tear up a scrap of paper .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
