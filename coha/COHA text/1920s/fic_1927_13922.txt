THE scene is the back-yard and rear-part of the GILCHRIST farmhouse . The one-storey house with a chimney at the end projects into the yard from the right rear . A narrow porch , about eighteen inches above the ground , with small two-by-four posts for columns , runs the length of it . Near the left end is a door opening back into the kitchen , and about ten feet farther up the porch to the right a door leads back into the dining-room . Over to the left front a small outhouse with a door in the center projects into the yard . A short log drum before it serves as a step . A clothes-line stretches from the outhouse across the yard to the column at the end of the porch where a water-shelf with a basin and bucket is built . A soap gourd is nailed to the column , and higher up a towel hangs on a nail . A farm-bell caps the top of a pole by the water-shelf , a wire hanging down for ringing . Farther to the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two wooden tubs beneath it . In the yard at the center front are two large iron wash-pots with a pile of brown ashes and charred pieces of wood around them . And to the right of these is a well , boarded up to the height of a man 's waist , a bucket and chain hanging from a wheel and cross-piece above . The yard is bare save for a few straggling bunches of footworn grass here and there . Between the end of the outhouse and the house an open space gives a view of GILCHRIST 'S wide cottonfields . A summer evening is coming down over the GILCHRIST farm . The sun has set , and beyond the rim of pines that enclose the level fields to the west the sky burns with a great smouldering flame , and the evening star hangs up above the circle of the sky 's glow . From behind the house come the sounds of flapping wings and cackling of chickens going to roost , and somewhere down the lane the muffled bark of a dog is heard . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home gives his quavering lonely yodel , bursting now and then into a high snatch of song  --  " You kin bury me in de east , you kin bury me in de west " reaches his cabin and is silent . A wagon passes on the road before the house , off to the right , the teamster cracking his whip and complaining to his team . The GILCHRIST household is at supper in the dining-room . The door is open and the room is lighted by a lamp on the table . HARDY GILCHRIST sits at the end of the table with his back to the door . MRS . GILCHRIST , a pale , dark-eyed elderly woman , is at the opposite end facing GILCHRIST . NEILL SYKES , at GILCHRIST 'S right , is eating in huge mouthfuls and washing down his food with buttermilk . He is a heavy-set muscular young fellow of twenty-six or seven . MAG and LONIE , two scarred and weatherbeaten old creatures , sit at the left . MAG is stout and talkative ; LONIE , her sister , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . HARDY Have something else , Neill . p. 3 SYKES crossing his knife and fork on his plate and pushing back his chair.No-a-thanky . I ai n't et so much in I do n't know when . Them was good biscuits , Mis ' Etta . ETTA with a look out of her great gaunt eyes.Thanky , Neill . MAG passing her cup.I 'd choose a little more coffee , please ma'am . Takes a lot of moist to run a hoe-hand this hot weather . She pulls up her apron and wipes her streaming brow . ETTA Have some more , Lonie ? LONIE is picking timidly at a bone and only shakes her gray head without looking up . You , Hardy ? HARDY Got all I want , thanky . He crosses his knife and fork , clears his throat and wipes his lips with his handkerchief . Like you , Neill , I 've overdone it tonight . But if you want a steam-engine to run you 've got to fire it , hanh ? SYKES rising and coming out on the porch.Right . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows of . He sits down on the edge of the porch , picking his teeth with a goose-quill pick , and gazing across the fields. p. 4 HARDY breaking into a loud boyish laugh , and looking around.You have that . You 've slayed the crab-grass this day , my boy . That bottom corn 's a-r'aring this very minute . SYKES taking a plug of tobacco from his pocket and biting off a chew.I bet so . HARDY Grow ! It 'll grow if we have rain . Teasingly . In a few years , Neill , maybe you 'll be able to keep sight of me in the field . Laughing again . You 're a little young and tender yet . Bringing his hand down on the table so that the dishes rattle and LONIE drops her bone . Go to it , you Mag and Lonie ! Tomorrow 's another day , and you 'll need all you can hold . MAG Lord , Mr. Hardy , looks like you 'd be tired adder your day 's work . You 're spry as a spring gander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River township to plow me down . Mag , you 're getting old , old like a frost-bit ' simmon . MAG G'wan , Mr. Hardy , allus a-teasing . Old ? Muh lived to be ninety . I got forty year to go yit . HARDY I hope you got fifty of ' em , sixty  --  yea , seventy for that matter , Mag . I wisht you could live forever , wisht all of us could . He lapses into silence and sits drumming on the table . MRS . GILCHRIST glances sharply at him . He looks up . How you feeling tonight , Etta ? p. 5 ETTA About as common , I reckon . HARDY kindly.That hurting in your breast eased off any ? ETTA A little , not much . HARDY moodily.Ah , that 's bad , bad . But that Rhody of yours coming down from Durham will take some of the work off'n you . MAG Mr. Hardy , you better go up to Raleigh and git Mis ' Etta one o ' old Miss Smith 's plasters . That 'll bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARDY Do n't reckon Miss Smith can do much if the doctors ca n't . As if stung by some untoward remembrance he stands up and walks out on the porch . In the lamplight his face and figure are visible . He is a tall well-built man of thirty-five or forty , broad-shouldered and powerfully muscled . His face is etched and lined with the marks of exposure to rain and wind and sun . From beneath the grimness of his manner and the will that shows in his countenance a sort of irrepressible boyishness now and then breaks through . He goes to the water-shelf at the end of the porch and takes a drink of water . With the dipper in his hand he stares at the west and then up at the sky above . SYKES Looks right nice  --  out there . p. 6 HARDY Looks dry though . No sign of falling weather . SYKES spitting in the yard.Hanh , not much , Mr. Hardy . But that snake I hung up in the bottom may fetch it . HARDY going into the kitchen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them cotton rows out there standing full of water , Neill . Have a smoke ? He sits down on the edge of the porch before the kitchen door . SYKES ' T would be fine , shore . We need it . No a-thanky . In the dining-room MAG and LONIE continue their eating . MRS . GILCHRIST sits with her chin resting on her hand gazing vacantly before her . HARDY I heard raincrows hollering this morning too . SYKES Mought a-been a ' old turkle-dove . HARDY A raincrow . I 've heard too many of ' em not to know . SYKES Yeh . He leans his head wearily against a porch column . GILCHRIST looks at him slyly . HARDY chuckling.Tired , Neill ? SYKES jerking up his head.Hunh  --  me ? No sir-ee. p. 7 HARDY Tired . SYKES Well , a fellow do get sorter sleepy-like adder a heavy meal like what I et . HARDY Come on now , you 're broke down , ai n't you ? SYKES This here has been a hard day . Hot , Lord , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock . Yeh , I 'll give in , Mr. Hardy , you just about plowed me to death today . HARDY gleefully.That so ? Come on , come on , a great big fellow like you let an old man kill you at work . And I 'd already sided half a ' acre when you got to the fields this morning . SYKES " Old fellow , " the dog 's foot ! You ai n't old . HARDY mockingly.Old , old I am . Why , I can remember back and ' way , ' way back . SYKES You ai n't forty yit . HARDY Do n't lack but a year of it , Neill . And you ai n't but twenty-five . SYKES Twenty-six ' cording to Muh 's Bible . HARDY Just a boy . Reaching playfully over and touching NEILL 's cheek . Hunh , he ai n't never stropped his razor yet . SYKES grinning.Pshaw , my beard 's grow worse'n a turkey gobbler 's . GILCHRIST suddenly tumbles over from the porch in a handspring . He jumps to his feet shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the table along with LONIE.Lord , Lord , listen to Mr. Hardy out there . ETTA still looking before her.Mag , I wish you would n't use the Lord 's name that-a-way . MAG But he 's jest sich a case . HARDY Can you do that , Neill ? SYKES I ai n't no good at tricks . HARDY spitting.Tricks ! Exercising his arms . Muscle power , Neill . Slapping himself . In here and here and here . I hope it 'll be a hundred year giving out . Soberly . But threescore and ten is all we 're promised , Neill , and most of the time them promises do n't hold good at that . Rising suddenly and going to the dining-room door . Mag , you and Lonie clean up the dishes , Mis ' Etta 's wore out tonight . ETTA No , no , they 've chopped cotton hard all day . I 'll wash the dishes . HARDY No , let them wash ' em . I 'll add a little extry to your day 's work , Mag . Gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etta . That dining-room 's hot as a furnace . He takes a chair out for her. p. 9 MAG Yeh , we 'll wash the dishes , Mis ' Etta . MRS . GILCHRIST rises and lights a lamp from a table in the corner and passes through a partition door into the kitchen . Through the open kitchen porch door a cupboard , stove and cooking utensils are seen . MAG and LONIE begin clearing away the dishes and passing into the kitchen with them . MRS . GILCHRIST throws a shawl over her shoulders , comes out on the porch and sits down . She takes out her snuff brush and box and begins dipping . HARDY Etta , I 've told you about working at that hot stove the way you do . Wisht you 'd quit it . ETTA Nobody else to . HARDY I can get Sandy 's gal back if you 'd let me . ETTA I do n't want that Negro girl in the same house with me . HARDY Why ? ETTA I believe she steals  --  and  --  and  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well  --  SYKES I never heard nothing ag'in ' her as a nigger . ETTA I do n't want her around . HARDY looking at her sharply.What you mean , Etta ? p. 10 ETTA nervously.I  --  I could n't stand her uppity ways . SYKES whistling through his teeth.Mebbe her good looks made her uppity . ETTA I 've seen things about her I did n't like , I tell you . HARDY suddenly.Anh ! ETTA What is it , Hardy ? HARDY Nothing . ETTA But now that Rhoda 's coming from Durham to live with us , I wo n't need any help . I can get along . SYKES When 's she coming , Mis ' Etta ? ETTA Any time now . HARDY striking his thigh with his fist.Great goodness ! ETTA Hardy ! HARDY standing up and walking back and forth in the yard.Nothing , Etta . He goes to the left at the end of the house and stands gazing out at his growing cotton . Be having blooms out there , Neill , before the nineteenth of June . Grown squares on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . p. 11 ETTA who has been watching GILCHRIST.We got a letter in the mail yesterday from Rhoda and she said she 'd come soon 's she could git her pore muh 's things straightened out . She may come tomorrow or next day or she may not come till next week . I would n't have been surprised to see her come today . SYKES Wonder how she 'll take to the farm ? HARDY turning back into the yard.Nohow , that 's how . Anybody 's been living in a town all their life ai n't no use out here , I guess . SYKES Bet it 'll be lonesome for her here . HARDY She wo n't find no bathtubs and shining lights here and great crowds jostling and jamming . No , she wo n't by a long sight . I give her just a week to learn there 's just one place she hates worse'n a farm and that 's the place the good preachers talk so much about . SYKES What place is that , Mr. Hardy ? Hah-hah . HARDY It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to . I ai n't baptized and I do n't go to church . SYKES Reckon I 'll be right there trying to far the b'ilers fast as you can . ' Twould n't seem natural if we were n't trying to outdo each other . p. 12 ETTA Neill ! SYKES Course , Mis ' Etta , we had n't ort to joke about scripture matters , I reckon . HARDY sitting again on the edge of the porch and puffing his cheroot.According to the Book I guess I 'll go there all right , me being an infidel and all , but I ai n't done nothing particular wrong as I know of . Thumping his chest . I 'm not condemned in here . ETTA Hardy ! HARDY turning and looking directly at Mrs. GILCHRIST.From people 's talk I know they suspicion things about me . Smiling grimly . Anh , it worries ' em because they ca n't find nothing against me . ETTA agitated.No , Hardy , it do n't neither . People respect you everywhere , all but your religious notions . SYKES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the country . HARDY fixing NEILL with his eye.Neill , people are quare . They look up to me around here , do they ? I 'm honest , I work hard , I 've accumulated property  --  some . And yet half this neighborhood would be glad tomorrow to hear I 'd done something awful . It 's not because I do n't join in with ' em at the church and sing , and shout at meeting and be like the rest of ' em . You know what 's in folks , Neill , that makes ' em like that ? p. 13 SYKES shaking his head. No sir-ee . Cai n't make heads or tails of it when you git to talking deep . HARDY You do n't know what it was in old man Jacob Alford made him start a little tale on me , do you ? SYKES What tale ? HARDY Tell him , Etta . ETTA What in the world is he talking about ? SYKES Search me , Mis ' Etta . HARDY Now old Jacob is a good soul . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few times has dropped into trances praying over sinners . And he 's a good man and still he tells a little lie about me and Sandy 's colored gal . MAG coming to the kitchen door.Course none of us did n't believe it , Mr. Hardy ! SYKES snorting.Hunh , that tale ! Nobody believed it . HARDY Somebody believed it a little bit , did n't they , Etta ? ETTA hurriedly.Let 's quit talking about that ! Old Jacob Alford 's weak-minded . HARDY You see , Neill , people like such stuff ; it 's excitement , something to interest ' em . Deep down they ai n't Christian , Jew or Gentile , black or white , but just people . Spitting on the ground . And people are quare , Neill , quare . They want something to talk about , something to interest ' em , I say . p. 14 MAG going back to her dishes.You hear that , Lonie ? LONIE nods her head . SYKES I reckon you 're right , Mr. Hardy . HARDY picking up a stick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figgered it out . Ah , funny ! SYKES after a long silence.I saw something that interested me once . HARDY teasing.You know you did n't , Neill . SYKES I did too . MAG comes to the door and listens . LONIE washes away automaton-like at the dishes inside . That time I carried a load of tobacco up to Durham for the old man . Talking about Rhody and her coming from Durham made me think of it . Adder I sold my tobacco that day it was late at night and I was coming out late from town . Just as I got clost to the Malbourne Hotel I never heard sich a racket of music and horns a-blowing and drums a-going it inside . It was music to beat the band . Never heard nothing fine as that before . Tell you what , it made the natchel hair quile up on the back of my neck . What 'd I do but drive off in a side street and hitch my mules and go back there and ast a man all dressed up in a uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say nary a word , jest motioned me in . I went inside a big waiting room and stood , Lord , I do n't know how long , looking through a glass door at the goings-ons in another big room , bigger'n the whole end of this house here . And there was men and women cutting up in there , kicking their heels , sashaying and promenading up and down same as they was wild . And dresses ! A plumb millionaire 's fortune was walking on that floor . The men was all diked out in white shirts as stiff as a ' arning board down to their belly-band and shoes you could see yourself in . And their claw-hammer coats hung ' way , ' way down behind . p. 15 HARDY And the women , how were they dressed , Neill ? SYKES waving his hand. I 'm jest gitting to them . The women  --  some of ' em had gray hair , but they looked young like girls  --  they was dressed like a wedding , and they did n't have much on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to hide things . Behind they was as bare as the pa 'm of my hand  --  down , well , low down . ETTA Neill ! SYKES I 'm telling what happened , Mis ' Etta . It ai n't my fault how they dressed . Some of ' em had on little gold shoes Mag there could n't git her big toe in , and silver shoes and satin and I do n't know what all . And most every one of ' em had a bunch of flowers at their waist big as a slop-bucket . Their cheeks was red and their teeth white as snow , and they was plumb purty as angels . ETTA shrilly.They were painted hussies , every one of ' em ! SYKES staring at her . I 'm sorry , Mis ' Etta . ETTA twisting her shawl around her.The sin in such places ! HARDY Pleasure ai n't sin to everybody , Etta . MRS . GILCHRIST is silent . Presently NEILL goes on. p. 16 SYKES Well , I reckon I 'd a-been there yit if the thing had n't busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head for a month or two . Fact is , it ai n't out even to this day . He hums reminiscently . Ta-ta , ta-ta . MAG from the door.Wonder if Miss Rhody 'll be like one of them painted women . She bursts into a loud laugh . ETTA That she wo n't . Sister Minnie knew how to raise her child . I 'll give her credit for that . HARDY Did n't look much like it when Rhody was down here years ago  --  and mischievous !  --  my  --  into everything . And as thin as a rail . She 'll be too weak to help much in the house . ETTA suddenly crying out.She 'll at least be company in this lonesome place , company . NEILL lowers his head and GILCHRIST is silent . HARDY presently.I hope she will , Etta . Yeh , I hope she 'll be able to play the organ in there and help you sing your hymns . ETTA shyly.That 'd be fine . SYKES I reckon she 's about grown now , ai n't she ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here visiting and that 's been ten years ago . HARDY Has ? Goodness , do n't seem more'n four or five at the most . ETTA Time seems longer to some folks , Hardy , than it does to you . HARDY looking at her kindly.Yeh , yeh , I reckon it does , Etta . Turning towards the kitchen and calling . Mag , bring that lamp out'n the dining room , if you do n't mind , getting a little dark out here . He goes to the tree in the front of the yard and gets a tub and takes it to the well . He then draws a bucket of water , pours it in and takes it back to the porch . MAG brings the lamp out and sets it on the water-shelf . By this time dusk has come on and the fields have become filled with a blue nebulous shade . GILCHRIST sets his tub down and begins taking off his shoes . MAG and LONIE come from the kitchen wearing their slat bonnets , and sit farther up the porch dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his shoes and stares at the sky . See that , Neill ? SYKES jerking his head again from the post.I did n't see nothing . HARDY A little wink of lightning right below the North Star . p. 18 SYKES Where ? HARDY To the north . Pointing . Look , there it goes again . That means rain , Neill , rain in forty-eight hours . That 'll hit us just right  --  cotton and corn !  --  According to the old saying . MAG to LONIE.Look , Lonie , there goes the lightning again . Rainy weather coming on and you can rest . HARDY taking off his other shoe and pouring out the dirt.The moon quarters day after tomorrow . Suddenly in the trees behind the house the katydids burst into a floody chattering . And there goes them June bugs singing their heads off in them maples . Hot nights and June bugs and rain , what more can crops want ? Pointing up into the sky at an angle of about forty degrees . See there , Neill , how the Great Dipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smugness in his voice . It 'll be pouring out water soon . You'n me better clean out that bottom corn on the creek tomorrow . SYKES Thought you laughed at me yistiddy for talking o ' signs . HARDY I do n't especially believe ' em Laughing.  --  but then they used to work for my daddy . p. 19 SYKES Is that Dipper the one old man Jacob says fell out of the north the year of the earthquake ? Softly . Oh , ho , I believe in ' em myself . HARDY The same , except it did n't fall . LONIE in a sudden sharp husky little voice.Reckon Ol ' Moster lives out there ' mongst them stars ? ETTA God 's power is everywhere , Lonie , in you and me and in them fields out there  --  everywhere . GILCHRIST pulls off his socks , rolls up his trouser legs and begins washing his feet in the tub . He made everything that creepeth , everything that flies , everything to glorify his holy name . Yea , he 's there among the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sion , Etta ? ETTA You and Lonie must n't forget to say your prayers , Mag . Do you ? MAG I du n no hardly  --  mebbe so . I du n no . Ask Lonie . LONIE with a dry cough.Did he make the pore and the rich , Mis ' Etta , some to live easy , some to live hard ? ETTA He made all things , Lonie . LONIE her voice dying in a wheezy sigh.I reckon he did . Sump'n ' made it . She bows her head under her bonnet and says no more . GILCHRIST finishes rinsing his feet and props them up on the side of the tub to dry. p. 20 HARDY Neill , when you go down the road , I wish you 'd give the mules some more water . A hot night like this they need it . SYKES All right , sir . MAG standing up.Time for you'n me to be gitting up the road along home , Lonie . LONIE gets to her feet and they go across the yard to the left . HARDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have breakfast on the dot , Mag . LONIE suddenly stubs her foot against a plank as she goes across the yard . Look out , Lonie , you hurt your foot . He rises quickly . Here , let me help you . But she limps on off around the house without a word . MAG She ai n't hurt , Mr. Hardy . See you all tomorrow if nothing happens . HARDY Yea . SYKES getting up.Believe I 'll mosey along too , Mr. Hardy . HARDY All right , Neill . Catch a good night 's sleep . Laughing . You 'll need it tomorrow . I want you to work my tongue out down on that creek . SYKES going around the end of the house.Cai n't be done . I give up . Good night . Good night , Mis ' Etta. p. 21 ETTA Good night . HARDY See you in the morning . He sits down on the porch again . Poor old Lonie ! He suddenly strikes the porch floor with his clenched fist . God A'mighty , she 's suffered and been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Old Moster out there in the stars ! ETTA Why you want to swear so much , Hardy ? Lonie and Mag both have a lot to answer to before their God . They 've been bad women in their young days . HARDY a sudden savagery in his voice.Both man and God have wiped their feet upon ' em . Etta , sometimes I think you got too much religion . ETTA Hardy , do n't take the Lord 's name in vain . HARDY Well , I 'm right . The old Squire Morgan et up Lonie 's looks and strength all the years of his life and then dies without leaving her a brownie . He threw her off like a nigger 's shoe in a fence-jamb . Why did God Almighty make such a man , tell me , if he made everything ? ETTA His ways are beyond us . Judge not . HARDY Yeh , I had n't ought to talk so , I reckon . Anyhow it 's most over now . Lonie wo n't be good for many more summers ' work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go . HARDY sharply.God better get ready to receive her . ETTA crying out.Hardy ! Do n't talk like that , I tell you . HARDY brushing the dirt from his feet.All right , I 'm done . Yeh , maybe you and the preachers are right . I am a blaspheming man  --  I 'm an infidel , I 'm lost . But the things in this world are enough to make a man cuss out the Holy Ghost , whatever that is . ETTA sadly.Some day , Hardy , it 'll come to you in a great light . You see through a glass darkly now , then as face to face . Bowing her head in her shawl . I 've prayed and prayed it would . HARDY Now , Etta , never mind me . ETTA drying her eyes.Still , let 's do n't fall out , Hardy . HARDY reassuringly.Sure we wo n't . Buoyantly . We have our ups and downs like other folks , but as long as we pull together we 'll get along . Do n't get down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ETTA Yes , everything 'll come out for the best . It 's promised to us in the Bible . p. 23 HARDY Them promises  --  He bites his lip and refrains . I tell you what , Etta , I was a-thinking as I plowed along today that if something happened to me before Mag and Lonie passed out , I 'd want ' em provided for so 's they would n't suffer . As long as I live I 'll see to ' em and give ' em work to do . ETTA You 'll be here many a day after they 've gone to the churchyard . HARDY You never can tell . Yes , I 'd want you to see to ' em . I 'll do for ' em what that cussed old Morgan ought to have done . ETTA Yes , yes . HARDY I 've worked and saved to accumulate something and  --  well , there 's nobody to leave it to after we 're gone  --  MRS . GILCHRIST makes no reply , and they sit for a moment in silence . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening star there , Etta , shining through them pines , big as a young moon . I 've heard it said that the evening star is the same as the morning star . MRS . GILCHRIST suddenly breaks into low sobs . What 's the matter ? He rises and comes over to her . Stop it now . Do n't cry . ETTA Oh , I keep thinking and thinking about it . I 've ruined your life . I ought never to have married you . p. 24 HARDY Now you feel bad . Go on to bed , tomorrow you 'll be all right . ETTA No , no . I 'll never be all right any more . She catches his hand and holds it . I was sitting there at the table and hearing you talk and laugh and play out here and it come all over me of a sudden how old I am and you so young . HARDY Why , we 're the same age , Etta . ETTA No , I 'm old , old enough for your mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the house . HARDY Now that 's all right . He pats her shoulder . I think that was a buggy stopped out there . Somebody 's talking . He listens . Presently hoof-beats are heard going up the lane . No , I guess they 've gone on , whoever it is . You 've got nothing to feel bad about , Etta . Fifteen years you 've been a faithful wife . I 'd never been able to make what I have without you . ETTA raising her head.What 's to be will be anyhow . But I 've ruined your life . HARDY Stop it , Etta . ETTA I 've been worthless to you . I 've been a barren fig tree , fit only for casting in the fire . p. 25 HARDY Jerking his hand from her and walking up and down the porch.You ca n't help it . ETTA With the right sort of woman you 'd have boys of your own now going with you in the fields  --  HARDY I tell you to hush it ! He sits suddenly down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patting his foot nervously on the ground . In a moment he goes on quietly . And still you go on believing in this God of yours , praying to him , trusting in him , and what does he do for you ? Bitterly . It 's all for the best , it 'll all come out right ! Yes , it will , and when ? Where is this God ? Show him to me  --  Stretching out his palm and closing it as if strangling something . Him who mashes us in the hollow of his hand like a worm ! Is he up there in the sky ? Is he down there in the earth ? Spitting scornfully . No , he ai n't . He wo n't answer me and he wo n't answer you till the judgment day , and what good will it do then ? ETTA Hardy , Hardy , that 's blasphemy to talk like that . HARDY standing up.Sometimes I think on it till I 'll go crazy . Yea , your God , he boasts and brags in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars and the light of the firmament above . And he made man , he says , in his own image and set him a king among all things . Then tell me why he persecutes people so ? Look at Lonie  --  ground down to the bottom like the dirt I plow in . And you ai n't seen them four idiot women over at the porehouse , have you ? Where is he ? Let him show hisself , and I 'd match muscle with him like Jacob of old . Throwing out his hands helplessly . But he wo n't answer . He wo n't come in the night . He wo n't come in the day , for this God of yours do n't exist . He ai n't nowhere . I 'm right and you and the preachers are wrong . p. 26 ETTA vehemently.I know that my Redeemer liveth and I 'll trust him though he slay me . There 's the word for it . HARDY Go ahead and trust him then , for he 'll slay you all right . Pore Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and she 's never known nothing but suffering . If she 'd gone to work trusting in her own might . Ah , it would have been different . ETTA I 've got to believe in him . I could n't live without it , and Aunt Margaret could n't live without it . HARDY Well , let 's stop . Talking wo n't change it either way . They are both silent . Suddenly out of the darkness at the left a young girl appears carrying a cheap suitcase . She speaks in a soft voice . CAMPBELL Good evening , you all . HARDY looking up in astonishment.Good evening , ma'am . The girl comes forward into the light . She is about twenty-three or - four years old , strong and well-made . Under a wide hat her brown hair clusters around her pale tired face and soft eyes . About her is a queer combination of innocence and wisdom . Her drooping weariness only partly conceals a sort of richness in her  --  a richness of living around her lips and in her eyes and full-breasted figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engrafted in her , giving along with her girlishness an air of decisiveness and strength as of one who had known the hard responsibility of bread and meat for others . She sets her suitcase heavily down. p. 27 CAMPBELL You all do n't know me , do you ? GILCHRIST rises to his feet and in embarrassment rolls down his trousers . NEILL comes in with a small trunk under his arm . HARDY I ca n't say we do . ETTA It ai n't Rhody , is it ? CAMPBELL laughing.That 's who it is , Aunt Etta . She hurries over to MRS . GILCHRIST and kisses her . How are you all ? Turning to GILCHRIST . You did n't know me , did you , Uncle Hardy  --  I have n't seen you in so long . HARDY fumbling with his shoes as he puts them on.You do n't mean you 're the little girl who was down here visiting once ? CAMPBELL shaking hands with him. I 've grown up , you see . Anybody will grow up in ten years . ETTA Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhoda . GILCHRIST hurries into the dining-room and fetches a chair . HARDY Sit down , I bet you 're tired out . NEILL sets the trunk on the porch , takes off his hat and remains respectfully standing. p. 28 CAMPBELL No , I 'll sit right here on the edge of the porch the way I did a long , long time ago when you would sit over there making hawk-callers for me . HARDY Did I ? I be dog ! She pulls out her hat-pin and takes off her hat . ETTA You sure have changed , Rhoda . I would n't a-known you anywhere . HARDY How 'd you get here ? CAMPBELL I came over from the station with Mr. Matthews . He brought my trunk by  --  if you can call it a trunk  --  and everything . We met Neill  --  your name is Neill , is n't it ?  --  as we came by the barn . SYKES Yes , ma'am , that 's my name . Yeh , I met ' em out there in the lane . Where you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ETTA Put it in the upper room , Neill . NEILL takes the trunk and goes along the porch and into the house at the right . MRS . GILCHRIST gets to her feet and follows him . You just sit still , Rhoda , and I 'll go in and see that the room is all straight . We 've had it fixed for you several days . CAMPBELL Oh , Hardy , I can hardly realize I 'm going to live here with you and Aunt Etta the rest of my life . HARDY mumbling.Wo n't take you long to get tired of this place . p. 29 CAMPBELL Tired ? I 'll never get tired . For ten long years I 've wanted to come back . And now I 'm here  --  She stands listening . What 's that ? HARDY What ? CAMPBELL That singing in the trees ? HARDY That 's June bugs , we call ' em . The right name is katydids . CAMPBELL They sound happy enough . And look up there in the sky at the stars shining . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right down here and sleep forever . HARDY mumbling again.Yeh , yeh . CAMPBELL There was always a crowd going and coming up there , such a stir nobody could rest . And out here there 's room , plenty of room and so quiet you can hear yourself think . And everything smells so sweet too . She gets up and goes over to the left and stands straining her eyes in the darkness . Is that cotton growing out there ? HARDY The best in the neighborhood . CAMPBELL I know you 'd raise the best . I know you would . Tomorrow I 'll get me a hoe and chop along with the others . NEILL and MRS . GILCHRIST come down the porch. p. 30 HARDY You 'd blister your hands the first thing . CAMPBELL without looking around.I want to blister them . My granddaddy and grandmother on both sides were farmers and I 've inherited it . I 've always felt it so . Mother had no business in a town . She looks up at the sky with shining eyes . This is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAMPBELL I 've already had my supper , thank you , Aunt Etta . ETTA Maybe you 'll want to go straight to bed , Rhoda . Your room is ready . CAMPBELL pointing to the tree in the yard.Yes . What kind of tree is that ? HARDY That 's a common china tree . SYKES They 're common everywhere . CAMPBELL Sure . It was nothing but a sprout when I was here a long time ago . Turning . All right , Aunt Etta . I am purty tired . She goes up the porch . Good night , you all . See you in the morning , I 'm sorry I got here so late . HARDY Good night . SYKES Good night , Miss Rhody. p. 31 CAMPBELL turning back.And wo n't I just eat you out of house and home though ! Eggs and potatoes and sausage and ham and collards and cracklings and all the garden " sass " you could haul in a cart , and buttermilk by the gallon ! With a sudden look at MRS . GILCHRIST . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She and MRS . GILCHRIST go up into the house at the right . NEILL leans against a post looking up the porch and slapping his leg idly with his hat . SYKES Well , sir  --  J declare ! HARDY What 'd you say , Neill ? SYKES Nothing , nothing . GILCHRIST picks up his cheroot from the floor and lights it . He rises and walks in the yard . HARDY That lightning 's quit in the north , Neill . SYKES Yeh . HARDY walking back and forth.Quit ! SYKES No rain after all mebbe . HARDY Dry weather , and it 'll rain when it will rain . No , I do n't believe in signs , Neill . SYKES Well , I believe I 'll mosey on down the road . p. 32 HARDY Water the mules , Neill ? SYKES chagrined.I be blamed , I forgot it ! HARDY I thought so . SYKES Sir ? HARDY Nothing . SYKES Then ag'in I did n't have time . Good night . He goes off and immediately comes back . Reckon she can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NEILL starts off again . Neill ! SYKES Sir ? HARDY lightly.She ai n't painted . SYKES That 's right , she ai n't . He goes off chuckling . GILCHRIST sits again on the porch , leaning his head between his hands and smoking. @x Several months later , the same setting as before . It is a cold December day near noon , and a big fire is roaring around the pots in the middle of the yard . A pile of firewood is near by . Off to the left rear stretch the fields of brown cotton stalks , dull and dead in the sickly light of the winter sun . The empty burrs rattle in the freezing wind , and the smoke rising out of the kitchen chimney is swept away in its breath . The china tree to the left front is bare . HARDY GILCHRIST is killing hogs , and off to the left by the outhouse the sound of voices , shouts , singing and grunting is heard . MAG 'S voice is raised in a **25;2593;TOOLONG  --  I got bumps all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sixteen , thin and snaggle-toothed , is squatted near the fire broiling hog milts on the coals . He makes some pretensions to being dressed up , with a dirty collar and tie . And now and then he carefully takes off his cap , pulls out a small pocket mirror and arranges his hair which is shining with grease and parted in the middle , with two little rolls of twisted curls on either side . A battered auto-harp is lying on the bench close by . Presently he takes up a milt , squints , blows on it , and carefully lays it back to cook . Then after diligently cleaning his fingers with his dirty handkerchief , he sits on the bench and begins twanging the harp . SION watching the kitchen door and singing in a high contralto voice . I wisht I was a snowbirdWith nothing else to do , I 'd set in the top of the apple-tree And make sweet music fer you  --  Good-by , my lover , oh , tell me good-by . Old LONIE comes in at the left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old slat bonnet , and a man 's ragged coat . She dips the bucket into one of the pots and returns the way she came. p. 34 MAG calling.Hurry up , Lonie , and help ketch me these hyuh chit'lings ! HARDY shouting outside.Now everybody pull together ! Pull there , Neill , do n't let the hair set on that hog ! That 's it , scrape him , boys ! Get it off him while he 's hot . JACOB grunting and laboring.Do n't be afraid of him , folkses . He 's dead and cai n't bite you . Shuck him . I tell you , shuck that hog ! HARDY presently shouting again.Spit on your hands and turn him ! In a moment GILCHRIST with his sleeves rolled up rushes in carrying a bucket . He dips it in the pot . Look out , everybody , here I come ! This boiling stuff 'll bring that hair . He rushes out . Presently he shouts again . Mag , bring us a pan of hot water to work on this head ! SION takes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . SION . If all the trees was silverAnd the blooms was diamonts too , I 'd take me my ax and cut ' em all downAnd bring the sweet blossoms to you  --  Good-by , my lover , oh , tell me good-by . MAG sniffing the air as she comes in.The Lord help my life , such a scent ! p. 35 SION Hanh ? MAG You stink worse'n a goat . SION sullenly.It smells sweet . She uses it . MAG She do n't wallow in it . Reckon she puts lard on her hair too , do n't she ? SION Hern 's purty and 'll lay without it . MAG He 's plumb crazy with love . Setting hyuh all roached up , greased and perfumed and singing like the cherrybims in heaven . You 'd better be out there helping your pore old daddy scrape them hogs . SION I ai n't able to work . MAG I 'd like to git me a stick and blister your hide , you 'd work . SION Mammy and Pappy says I 'm weakly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . MAG Your belly ai n't weakly . I can tell you that . Going out with her steaming pan . If you was my young'un I 'd break me a hick'ry and beat some o ' that love and mess out'n you . SION stares after her , puckering his forehead thoughtfully . He giggles gleefully and gobbles down the milt . The kitchen door opens and RHODA comes to the well with a pail . She is neatly dressed and wears a bright red sweater . Her eyes sparkle and her cheeks are glowing in the cold. p. 36 SION cleaning his fingers and jumping up.Lemme git your water fer you , Miss Rhody . CAMPBELL Help yourself . He draws the water for her as she stands looking out at the workers , and takes it to the kitchen . At the porch he relinquishes the bucket and stares open-mouthed at the door that closes behind her . OLD JACOB , a little bent man of sixty-five with a gray ragged mustache , comes in and drags up the wash-bench before the fire . His old coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits down , blows upon his fingers and stretches his heavy shoes to the fire , laying a whet-stone and butcher-knife beside him . JACOB in a piping voice.Sion , your milt hyuh is a-burning up . With a bound SION is back to the pot . He grabs his broil from the coals and begins eating it . Gim me a leetle piece of it , Sion . SION Nunh-unh . They 's plenty of ' em out there in the tub , Pa . JACOB musing.Sech a hog killing , sech a hog killing . He 's got enough meat to stock the county . Anh , that 's the way it is , Sion , them that has gits more and them that ai n't got nothing it 's tuk away . SION irritably.That 's it mebbe. p. 37 JACOB looking at him fondly.Course you do n't understand it , pore fellow . You know you 'll be keered fer . The Laord pervides fer babes and sech . SION licking his fingers.Hee-hee . MAG comes in and bends over the fire warning her hands . MAG It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shivering . That wind jest cuts through you . JACOB punching the fire.It do . Cocking his eye towards the northeast . Bad weather a coming . Wild geese was flying south last night . Holding up his hand . The feel in the air ' minds me of the winter of ' ninety-four . Laord , Laord , that was a cold ' un . The Cape Fair froze over so you could drive acrost it with a mule and wagon . Mis ' Kivette did , and her baby with her . SION goes out and gets another milt and begins broiling it . OLD JACOB looks at him and chuckles . Jest look at that there boy . He ai n't never had a bait of them things in his life , and do n't he smell good ? MAG If I was Mr. Hardy I would n't let him eat up my fresh meat that-a-way , and he not earning his salt . p. 38 SION He do n't keer . JACOB That he do n't , Mag . Hardy 's sorry for the pore boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vale below . MAG Hunh ! JACOB changing the subject.Do n't seem lak a r'al hawg-killing and Aunt Marg'ret not hyuh . MAG She 's a-nussing that dying boy o'hern . JACOB I reckon . HARDY off at the left.Step back , Neill , and let me hang him ! JACOB Jest look a-there at Hardy lifting that hawg up by hisself . He 'll weight three hundred if a pound . HARDY outside.Hanh , there you are . All right , Neill , bring me fresh water and the tub and I 'll gut him in a pair o ' minutes . NEILL comes in and gets a bucket of water from the pot . SYKES Jacob , you better fill up this here pot . He goes out as old JACOB creaks to his feet and begins drawing water at the well . MAG Sion , git some wood and put on the fire . SION This hyuh melt is jest a-cooking fine . p. 39 MAG cutting the wood herself and replenishing the fire.You make me mad enough to kill . LONIE comes in and sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot and sits down by her . He begins whetting his knife . MRS . GILCHRIST , wrapped in a heavy cloak , walks unsteadily down the porch from the right and stands leaning against a post looking out . ETTA How you all getting on , JACOB ? JACOB Got ' em all killed and hanging up now , Mis ' Etta , and a mighty fine chance of meat you got out there too . ETTA How much you reckon it 'll make , Jacob ? JACOB Three thousand pounds , no less . I 'd stake them two haslets Hardy give me on it . ETTA Two ? JACOB with a touch of gleeful malice.Two and a backbone . Me'n my raft o ' young'uns ' ll feed Sunday . ETTA Yes . Her eyes roam wearily over the fields and sky . She turns and goes slowly up the porch into the house again . Presently there is the weak labored sound of an organ inside , and a thin shrill voice singing " There is a fountain filled with blood . " p. 40 JACOB Pore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave . MAG Hanh ! Getting most too weak to play her organ now . LONIE gives a little nodding jerk with her head . JACOB ' Two n't be long and she 'll be to that bo'rne from whence no traveler returns , as the scripture says . LONIE with a gasp.Sump'n 's killing her . JACOB Aye , it is . She 's wasting fast . Sighing . We 've all got to come to it . MAG She 's a good woman too  --  better'n most people know . JACOB She is that . She do n't talk much , but she 's good . I ai n't never hearn her say a harm word ' bout nobody . Anh , she 's good With afterthought. and a lonesome woman too . MAG laughing and jerking her thumb towards the kitchen.That ' un she 's got in the house with her ai n't lonesome . She talks , she 's lively . JACOB with an admiring chuckle.Ai n't that young critter a wheel-hoss though ? Laord , Laord . She 's same as Neill and Hardy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she come here from Durham . But she were made fer the farm if anybody were . JACOB his eyes narrowing introspectively as he appears to forget the subject.Where does the scriptures say the spirits of hogs go when they die , Mag ? MAG popping her lips.They do n't go nowhere . They 're just dead , that 's all . JACOB In the ground , that 's where . It says the animal spirits return in the earth and the heavenly spirits go upward . Hah , hah . MAG Hogs ai n't got no souls . JACOB That 's what the scriptures says . They are silent . Presently RHODA comes to the kitchen door . JACOB watches her meaningly as he whistles to himself . CAMPBELL Sion , bring me some more water , please ! SION springs up and hurries to do her bidding . JACOB Jest look at that boy . He 'll work fer her , plumb crazy about her . MAG nodding as she spits.They 's others crazy about her if I 'm any judge . JACOB looking at her slyly.Heh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knife behind him and lowering his voice . How 's Neill gitting on with her ? p. 42 MAG Worships the ground she walks on . He goes around like a man asleep . JACOB quickly.Sho ' , sho ' . And her ? MAG Cai n't make out whe'r she takes to him or not . JACOB chuckles wisely again . JACOB looking back over the top of the house at the sun.Well , I reckon it 's ' bout dinner time fer us . MAG Yeh . Me'n Lonie 's going to leave the rest of the chit'lings to rid till after dinner . JACOB Heigh , Miss Rhody , ai n't it time to stop and feed ! SION coming out of the kitchen.She told me to . He rings the bell and returns to his broil . HARDY outside.Yeh , we 're just coming . Presently he and NEILL enter at the left . They come to the fire and warm themselves . Their hands are greasy and stained with blood . GILCHRIST turns and stands surveying the scene of his handiwork . How 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes sartain . HARDY Every one of them hogs hanging up there is less'n two years old . Purty good for piney-woods rooters , anh ? p. 43 JACOB You got the neighborhood beat in everything , Hardy . You 're the luckiest man ! HARDY Ai n't luck , Jacob , it 's hard work and a little use of my head . Sion , run there to the hog barrel and bring them two pans . SION My melt 'll burn , Mr.  --  HARDY reaching down with a laugh and lifting him up by the collar.Get the pans , Sion . SION with a terrified scamper dashes out and brings the pans . That 's a good boy . You all wash and get ready for dinner . I 'll get some soap . He goes to the water-shelf and takes a cake of home-made soap from the soap-gourd , calling . Is dinner ready , Rhody ? CAMPBELL opening the kitchen door and looking out. It 'll be ready in a few minutes , Hardy . HARDY Well , bring a little of your blackberry wine out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you do n't mind . MRS . GILCHRIST suddenly begins playing the organ again and singing . GILCHRIST stands listening a moment and then turns abruptly back to the group in the yard . He dips water from a pot and begins washing his hands in a basin . You all excuse me and I 'll wash this grease off'n my hands first . I want to step down to the barn and get a bag of salt . He pulls out a checkered handkerchief and wipes his hands . RHODA comes out with a pitcher of wine and a glass . As GILCHRIST goes off around the house , he calls back over his shoulder . Help yourself , folks . It 'll make you feel young . p. 44 JACOB Yes , and Neill needs it . He 's down in the dumps today . NEILL savagely stirs the fire around the pots . CAMPBELL pouring out the wine.Here , Lonie , drink a little . You must be frozen . LONIE takes it in her trembling clawlike hands and drinks . Old JACOB eyes her closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind out , Lonie , heh-heh . CAMPBELL And here 's some for you , Mag . MAG Thanky , ma 'm . She drinks and hands the glass back . CAMPBELL How much , Jacob ? JACOB Heh-heh-heh , I leave that to you . She pours him out a large glass . With a preparatory smacking of his lips and a clearing of his throat he takes the glass and drains it down . He screws up his cheeks till they close his eyes , washing the wine around over his toothless gums . MAG You 're a-gitting all there is out'n it , Jacob . JACOB I am that , heh-heh , I am that , Mag . CAMPBELL pouring out another glass.Here , Neill . p. 45 SYKES without looking up. I do n't want none . CAMPBELL Come on and drink some . SYKES sharply.I do n't want none , I tell you . JACOB What ails you , Neill , got the mulligrubs ? CAMPBELL Here , drink it , Sion . JACOB Hyuh , that boy 'll be down drunk if he swallows all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom and hands it to SION . Mebbe that wo n't hurt you . Do n't know though , the smell of a rotten apple makes him drunk . SION drinks his swallow and hands the glass back to RHODA . SION shyly.That was shore good , Miss Rhoda . CAMPBELL Glad it was , Sion . Anybody have any more ? JACOB No , no , a little snitch later on in the evening when the cold gits blue . MAG No 'm , I got enough now . LONIE shakes her head too and RHODA returns into the kitchen . JACOB Wonder Mis ' Etta would let ' em have wine around . Hastily . Not that there 's any harm in it , of course . p. 46 MAG Mebbe she cai n't help herself . JACOB They 's gospel fer drinking it though . God the Saviour hisself made wine at a wedding once . Suddenly he pops his hands together and rubs his thighs . That stuff shore goes to the right spot . Now a good dinner of collards and backbone and sweet ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bout you , Neill ? SYKES What ? JACOB cackling.By gums , he did n't even hear me . Anh , he 's studying , wropped up in sump'n ' . What is it , Neill ? SYKES Cai n't a man keep his mouth shet if he wants to ? JACOB Heh-heh-heh , I reckon he kin . More mouths than one 's been shet up  --  some of ' em forever  --  by a bright piece o ' calico . SYKES turning his burning eyes upon him. What 'd you say ? JACOB starting back.Oh , nothing , Neill , nothing . Suddenly reaching down and grabbing a pan . Le 's wash , everybody . He dips water out of a pot and begins washing his hands . MAG and LONIE do likewise ; NEILL stands staring at the fire . Old JACOB throws the water from his pan and gets the towel from the porch . He wipes his hands and passes it on to MAG . SION , now that RHODA is in the house , sits contentedly on his haunches gnawing his meat. p. 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come help me set the table and get the things on ? We 'll have dinner in a jiffy . And you 'll be a lot warmer in here out of that wind . They hang the towel on a limb of the tree and go in , closing the door behind them . Old JACOB sits down on the bench whetting his butcher knife . JACOB Neill , I did n't mean to make you mad with my talk . You know I will talk , my tongue jest will . SYKES turning himself about.Oh , that 's all right . I ai n't feeling well . JACOB Ai n't ? I 'll declare that 's bad . Where do you hurt , Neill ? SYKES Jest feel bad . JACOB slyly.Pneumony ? SYKES I du n no , I tell you . JACOB mournfully.Anh , pore fellow . Again he pops his hands together and slaps his thighs . Laord , that stuff warmed me up . He gets up from the bench , brandishes his knife in the air and cuts a step or two . Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ransom Pate 's dance . He turns and pokes his face up by NEILL 's shoulder . Ai n't she a purty thing , Neill ? p. 48 SYKES Who 's purty ? JACOB cackling and gesturing towards the house.Her in there . She 's like one o ' them big red apples you buy at the store . SYKES spitting with a distasteful grimace.I 've seed better looking many a time . JACOB No , you ai n't , Neill . They do n't make ' em no purtier . And I ai n't never seed a smarter one . Wisht I could call back about thirty year , I 'd go fer her . SYKES breaking into a bitter laugh.You ! JACOB Yeh , me . Oh , yes , I had a way with ' em , Neill , I had a way . Stepping before him and looking significantly up in his face . Oh , my boy , you do n't know your business . The way to do is to walk in and take ' em . Laord , with your strength you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she comes out to this here pot , I 'd jest up and say , " Rhody , we 'll git married tomorrow , " perviding that was the date you 'd sot , and tomorrow we 'd be married . SYKES Hunh , you do n't know Rhody . Quickly . I ai n't planning to git married to nobody nohow . JACOB Heh-heh-heh , I know you , Neill , I see through you . Anh , she 'd make a match fer you , she would . Smacking his lips , his eyes shining . Anh , blackberries and strawberries , Neill , they ai n't nothing to her . Boy , she 's ripe and ready to pick . I hate to see her going to waste and you 'd better retch and pick her or somebody will . p. 49 SYKES angrily. I do n't want to hear no more of it . JACOB throwing out his arms.I 'm giving you good advice all right . Stretching his hands out towards the fire . Do n't she keer nothing fer you a-tall , Neill ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I reckon . JACOB Mebbe they 's somebody else . SYKES Ai n't nobody else to be . JACOB Heh-heh-heh . Yeh , you 're mebbe blind . You see the sporrer ' way , ' way yander , and miss the turkey clost by . SYKES grasping his arm.Have you seed her with anybody else ? Casting JACOB from him . Naw , they ai n't nobody in the neighborhood she 'd think of going with , though plenty of ' em wants to . JACOB winking his eye.Look clost by , Neill , clost by . SYKES staring at him. What you mean ? JACOB rubbing his hands in delight.I 'm too deep for you , ai n't I ? They do accuse me o ' that at times . Casually . Well , jest to be talking , say a man marries a woman like Mis ' Etta in there  --  no harm meant to her , pore critter  --  Say he 's a big strong fellow like Hardy . Well , sech a fellow sleeping in a cold bed every night fer fifteen year is gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 SYKES looking at him puzzled.Yeh , you 're too deep fer me . JACOB You ai n't never been married . That gal 'd warm Hardy 's bed proper , would n't she ? Mebbe she already has , heh , heh ! Yeh , them two 'd make a fine match to see , would n't they ? And the pore woman in there ca n't live much longer . SYKES Great God ! Air you crazy ? GILCHRIST comes in at the left with a bag of salt on his shoulder . He throws it in the outhouse at the left . Unseen by them MRS . GILCHRIST comes out on the porch and stands leaning against a post at the extreme right . JACOB watching GILCHRIST and chuckling.Aye , boy , she 's a rich ' un , ripe and ready . And I 've seed looks going between ' em . And I 've seed other things . MRS . GILCHRIST draws herself up rigid , listening . NEILL 's long arm shoots out and knocks old JACOB behind him . SYKES in a strained voice. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter , Neill ? JACOB Nothing , nothing , we 're playing , fer I 'm feeling young ag'in . Drawing back in alarm . Why , Mis ' Etta , I did n't know you was out here . p. 51 ETTA faintly.I just this second stepped out for a breath . CAMPBELL opening the dining-room door. Come on to dinner , you all . MAG and LONIE are seen taking their seats at the table inside . HARDY going towards the house.Come on , Jacob . Come on , Neill . Sion , get up and see if you can eat a little more . JACOB Coming with my mouth open . SION looks in his mirror and follows him , polishing his fingernails as he goes . HARDY stopping at the porch.What 's the matter , Etta ? ETTA Nothing , nothing . Shivering . I 'm cold . CAMPBELL You want me to bring your dinner up to the fire , Aunt Etta ? ETTA creeping weakly up the porch.Yes , bring it up there . She goes off to the sitting-room . GILCHRIST looks sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seats himself at the table . Old JACOB and SION troop in after him. p. 52 HARDY looking out through the door. Come on in to dinner , Neill . SYKES Go ahead and eat , I 'll be in in a minute . CAMPBELL coming out with a bucket.You all go ahead and wait on yourselves . I 've got to put some water on to heat . She comes to the well and begins filling her bucket . GILCHRIST , inside , reaches behind him , glances out , hesitates , and then closes the dining-room door . SYKES suddenly clenching his hands.Great God Almighty ! Blind , blind , I been blind as a bat ! CAMPBELL You better go on in and eat your dinner , Neill . SYKES Come here a minute , Rhody . CAMPBELL leaving the well and moving uncertainly towards him. What is it ? SYKES snatching her hand.Are you going with me to that party tonight ? CAMPBELL struggling to free herself.I told you once I would , Neill . SYKES Do you want to go with me ? CAMPBELL If I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn me loose or I wo n't go with you anywhere . MRS . GILCHRIST begins playing the organ again and singing " How Firm a Foundation . " p. 53 SYKES Oh , Rhody , I cai n't eat nor sleep for thinking of you . Cai n't you think a little bit of me , cai n't you ? CAMPBELL Behave yourself , Neill . Now let me go on back , somebody might see you . SYKES I do n't care who sees us . Wildly , as he puts his arm around her , holding her to him and pointing to the house . It 's him in there , ai n't it ? Swear to God you do n't love him in there at that table ! CAMPBELL I wo n't swear nothing . Let me go , I tell you . SYKES I wo n't let you loose . I 'm gon na find out something . CAMPBELL I 'll scream so Hardy will come out here . No , no , I wo n't either . I 'm not afraid of you . SYKES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart out with that there butcher-knife . Tell me , is it him ? CAMPBELL I wo n't tell you . I wo n't . NEILL snatches her to him and kisses her . She fights against him and finally breaks into low sobs . SYKES By God , it is him ; it is him ! And I 'll git him ! The dining-room door suddenly opens and GILCHRIST stands on the porch. p. 54 HARDY yelling.Neill ! There is a scramble inside as old JACOB rushes to the door to look out . NEILL releases RHODA and she drops down on the wash-bench weeping . GILCHRIST turns back towards the dining-room . You all go right on eating your dinner and do n't none of you open this here door ! He closes the door and steps out into the yard . Neill , what you mean treating Rhody like that ? SYKES Nothing . I ai n't hurt her . Let me alone now , I 'm going in to dinner . He starts by GILCHRIST . HARDY grasping him by the shoulder.No , you 're not till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACOB 'S butcher-knife from the bench.Get out of my way now . The first man lays hands on me I 'll kill him . HARDY What'n the name of God ails you , boy ! Neill , wake up , have you gone crazy ? CAMPBELL running to GILCHRIST.Go back , Hardy , go back in the house . He 'll hurt you . HARDY looking down at her. No , no , he wo n't . He pushes her gently behind him. p. 55 SYKES whining with rage.I see it all now . Yeh , it 's you been standing in between us . Stepping forward with the knife in his hand . Git out'n my way now . GILCHRIST hesitates a moment and then suddenly kicks the knife out of his hand . NEILL doubles up , nursing his hand against his stomach . GILCHRIST picks up the knife and throws it out into the field . HARDY Now , Neill , go on and eat your dinner and behave yourself . Old JACOB 'S inquisitive face is seen peering through the half-opened door . MRS . GILCHRIST is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that door , Jacob , and eat your dinner . Jacob bangs the door . SYKES half sobbing.Oh , I could n't see it and it all going on under my nose . Look at you there with your arm around her ! HARDY dropping his arm , his mouth twitching and his fists clenched.Neill , you and me 've been together too many days on this old farm to fight like cats and dogs . But if you say another word like that I 'll break your neck . SYKES springing at him.Try it then , you sneaking devil ! GILCHRIST grapples with him and as they scuffle back and forth over the yard RHODA stands wringing her hands and moaning . The dining-room door is opened cautiously and old JACOB comes out followed by SION , LONIE and MAG . They are gnawing potatoes and meaty bones which they carry in their hands . SION looks on a moment and then clings to his father in fear. p. 56 CAMPBELL Stop it ! Please stop it ! HARDY trying to hold NEILL 'S hands.Behave yourself now , Neill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's up ? MRS . GILCHRIST comes down the porch . ETTA dropping weakly to the edge of the porch and calling in a low voice.Hardy , Hardy ! As they struggle , GILCHRIST casts his eyes over NEILL 's shoulder at her . SYKES gasping.I 'll kill you . I know about you two dirty dogs ! HARDY snarling.Now , Neill , I 'll fix you ! SYKES Yeh , and I 'll knock your teeth down your damn throat ! GILCHRIST with a wrench frees his hand and strikes NEILL full in the face . He falls flat in the yard , the blood running from his mouth . ETTA Let me get away from it all , let me get away ! She totters up the porch again . HARDY bending over NEILL.Bring me some water , Rhoda , and a towel . She snatches the towel hanging in the tree and brings the bucket from the pump . GILCHRIST bathes NEILL 's face . He 'll be all right in a minute . MRS . GILCHRIST is heard praying in the house. p. 57 MAG Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JACOB slobbering with excitement.A mule could n't a-kicked him no harder . Laord , that was a blow ! HARDY looking up.Go on back to your dinner . Shouting . Every one of you ! He waves them off before him . With backward glances they all finally return to their meal and close the door . CAMPBELL He 's getting better now . SYKES suddenly sitting up and speaking in a low hard voice.Let me alone now , I 'm all right . He sits quietly a moment and then springs to his feet sobbing . Damn you both . Raising his hands above his head . May I bust hell wide open if I do n't git even . Whirling upon them . You God-damn dirty hawgs , that 's what you are ! RHODA shrinks back with her fingers to her ears , and NEILL rushes off around the house sobbing and cursing , leaving GILCHRIST bent on his knees . He leans forward , balancing himself with his hand on the ground . RHODA comes up to him and stretches out her hand , touching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARDY standing up and looking at her with a queer smile.Such things happen , they just seem to happen all of a sudden sometimes . CAMPBELL twisting her hands in her apron.What 's to come ? And poor Aunt Etta saw it all . Suddenly clutching his arm . I 'm afraid he 'll hurt you ! HARDY taking her hands from him. Well , let him . I 'll never lift my hands against him again . With a sharp sigh . Anh , I 've loved him like my own boy ! CAMPBELL It 's all because of me . I ought never to have come here . I 've felt it before . He suddenly looks at her intently and then turns away . HARDY You belong here . Come on , let 's go in now . I 've got to get back to my work . CAMPBELL shuddering.What he said ! HARDY Ah , do n't remember it . Helplessly . Still people will believe whatever he tells . He shakes his shoulders and opens the door for her . CAMPBELL looking up at him as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. p. 59 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 The scene is the GILCHRIST sitting-room and parlor , the night of the same day . At the center back is a fireplace with a log fire going , and to the right of this is a door which opens into the GILCHRISTS ' bedroom . At the right is a neatly curtained window , and farther up at the right front an organ at which MRS . GILCHRIST sits playing feebly . A lighted lamp is on the table in the center of the room . In the left center a door opens into RHODA 'S room , and farther ' back at the left rear is a door which opens to the back porch . By the door is a wooden box piled high with firewood . The room is carpeted with straw matting , and here and there cheap prim chairs are placed about the room . On the walls hang several crayon portraits , distorted likenesses of relatives dead and gone . A rocking chair with a quilt draped over it is before the fire . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arums like a brood of swallows in the chimney . ETTA singing and playing slowly . What a friend we have in JesusAll our sins and griefs to bear ! What a privilege to carryEverything to God in prayer ! Her voice dies away and she leans her face over the keys , sobbing softly in her shawl . Steps are heard coming up the porch , and she rises hurriedly and sits in the rocking chair . MAG comes in through the door at the left rear p. 60 MAG Mr. Hardy told me to come in here and warm , Mis ' Etta . The fire 's gone out in the kitchen . ETTA That 's all right . Come in . MAG stands to the fire warming herself . Where 's Mr. Gilchrist ? MAG He 's out in the smoke-house salting down the meat . ETTA When will he be done ?

ETTA We 're all poor erring creatures , Mag . We are nothing in our own strength , even Hardy ai n't , though , poor man , he thinks he is . MAG embarrassed.Yeh , yes , ma 'm , I know . Lord . Hastily . Well , I ai n't never seed such a come-off in my born days . p. 61 ETTA Let me forget it , Mag . MAG And it 's jest about to kill Mr. Hardy . He looks like his best friend had died . ETTA Have you heard where Neill is ? MAG Jacob come by about dark and said he 'd gone and hired to old man Turner . ETTA bowing her head suddenly in her hands.He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 'll be a sad day for him if he goes back to drinking the way he useter . MAG Hunh , Neill Sykes 'll not come back . I know him and I know th ' Sykeses .

He would n't a-done what he done today fer a million dollars , but now that he 's done it he 'll harbor it up till it eats his insides out like box-lye . ETTA in a gentle voice.Mebbe they 'll make up tonight at the party . MAG Quare  --  her driving over there in the cold by herself . ETTA Hardy told her to go . p. 62 MAG shaking her head. I do n't understand it all , not me . Mebbe we 're all crazy .

Ai n't you seen looks going between ' em ? MAG getting free and staring at the ceiling.I do n't know nothing about all that you 're saying , Mis ' Etta . Backing towards the door at the left rear . Miss Rhody 'll come to her senses and take Neill adder all , she will . Do n't you worry . Neill 's the very one cut out fer her . He 'll be her husband yit . Hurriedly . I got to go back now and help ' em finish . As she catches hold of the door it opens and LONIE comes creeping in and draws up a chair by the fire . MAG , somewhat reassured , moves up again . You git done , Lonie ? LONIE nods her head , bends down and takes off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fire and says nothing . Presently GILCHRIST comes up the porch and enters . He sits down and stretches out his legs . For several minutes no one says anything . MAG turns herself about by the fire. p. 63 HARDY Well , Mag , you and Lonie done fine today . I appreciate it . MAG That 's all right . We 're glad to do it , Mr. Hardy . HARDY I did n't mean to keep you so late . Pulling out his watch and winding it . Going on ten o'clock . Well , you all sleep late tomorrow . Need n't come till dinner time if you do n't want to . MAG All right , sir . They sit in silence , embarrassed . I reckon we better be going , Lonie . LONIE begins to put on her shoes . GILCHRIST takes out his pocketbook and pulls a bill from it . HARDY Here , Mag , is pay for today . MAG taking it.That 's too much , Mr. Hardy . HARDY No , it 's not . And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch for you to boil of a-Sunday . MAG Thanky , thanky . Come on , Lonie . LONIE gets up and follows MAG . Good night , you all . HARDY See you tomorrow some time . ETTA Good night . HARDY Oh , Lord ! He drops his head wearily on his breast . MRS . GILCHRIST looks at him searchingly . This has been a hard day for you , Etta . How you feeling ? p. 64 ETTA Now , Hardy , it 's come upon you at the last . HARDY What ? ETTA Now you see what can happen to a man who 's proud in his own heart . HARDY I know I done wrong to hit him . Looking at his hand . If I could just get the feeling of his face from my hand . Growling . Stop , do n't bring it up to me no more . ETTA All these years you 've stood out and matched your strength against God , and now he 's brought you down low to the ground . I been setting here by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's God 's work . HARDY What 's God got to do with it ? ETTA breathing heavily.He 's got everything to do with it . He can keep your heart purified and save you from strange women . HARDY in amazement.Etta ! ETTA He can keep you from temptation . He can open your eyes and show you the gin of the adversary set for your unwary feet . HARDY Well , you pray for me then . ETTA with a sob.I 've prayed and prayed and prayed . And all this time you 've hardened your heart , and now you 've brought a curse down upon you and your household . p. 65 HARDY Do n't talk no more , Etta . You 've had enough excitement for one day . ETTA You 've got to reach in your heart and tear this sin out by the roots . HARDY What sin , Etta ? ETTA panting.You know what sin . With a sort of chant . And if thine eye offend thee pluck it out . Raising her clasped hands above her . This house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping.Hardy , Hardy , ca n't you see where you are going ? Whoever looketh on a woman  --  as the Saviour said  --  Crying out . Thou shalt not  --  HARDY jumping up and walking across the room.Stop , stop ! He goes through the door at the rear . In a moment he returns with a stone churn in his hands and sets it near the fire . MRS . GILCHRIST dries her eyes and sits up cold and straight . With an effort he retains control of himself . He turns to her kindly . She told me to set her milk to turn and I was about to forget it . ETTA . softly.Her milk . p. 66 HARDY angrily.That 's just a way of speaking , Etta . ETTA Yes , yes , her milk , her broom , her chairs , her everything . I 'm a burden to the earth , I 'm in the way , but I 'll live to save you from yourself . I 've prayed to God and he 's promised me that . HARDY bitterly.Promised . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened between me and Neil today . Wipe out his black and bitter words about Rhody and send him back here where he belongs . ETTA They ca n't be wiped out . They were the truth . HARDY shouting.It 's a lie ! You know it ! She 's as pure as an angel ! ETTA putting out a weak hand.Do n't talk that way , Hardy . If I die the next minute I know it ai n't no lie . You 've looked on her , yes , you have Hoarsely . And it 's a horrible sin against me and against God . She closes her eyes and leans back in her chair . There ai n't no difference between the thought and the deed . And for all I know  --  Her voice dies away . HARDY dropping down in his chair , thunderstruck.Well , by God in heaven ! p. 67 ETTA You love her . HARDY I wo n't say no more to you . ETTA And she loves you . I 've known it a long time from the way she sews for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slaving for you . Oh , God above , this house is accursed ! She 's tried to hide it , but I 've seen it and today I 've heard more of it from other lips . HARDY Who 's been talking again  --  Jacob ? ETTA If it was him he knew something of what he said . HARDY The poor God-damned old crook ! But he ca n't help it , I reckon . ETTA It 's the truth . HARDY Etta , listen to me . ETTA There 's nothing you can say , Hardy . Tomorrow Rhoda gets her things and leaves here . HARDY We 'll come to that later . Listen to me now . ETTA Speak then . HARDY They ai n't no use in what we 're doing and saying . Let 's get at the truth . I 'll tell you everything that 's passed between Rhody and me . Last summer , it was August and about sunset down there in the bottom , she was helping me pile up the hay and there by her something come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want . Since then I ai n't looked at her and that 's the God 's truth . It was wrong to kiss her and I know it , but there 's no use denying it . I done it . p. 68 ETTA What you going to do now ? HARDY Ah ! ETTA After what happened between you and Neill today she ca n't stay here no more . People are going to be talking , Hardy . HARDY Let ' em talk . They 'll talk more if she goes away . We 'll think of something to do . Stop fretting now , you 'll worry yourself into your grave . ETTA And that 's what you want me to do . You and her both would be glad to see me carried out through that door feet foremost to the tomb . HARDY helplessly.Etta . ETTA But you wo n't see it . I 'll live and save you yet . Now you listen to me , Hardy . We 're going to settle things tonight . I 've told you Rhoda 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . ETTA She 's got to leave , I tell you , and that tomorrow . HARDY And I tell you she ai n't going . She come here for us to take care of and we 're going to do it . ETTA If she stays here you 're both lost and ruined . I 'm the one that had her to come . You did n't want her . p. 69 HARDY They ai n't no place for her to go and let 's say no more about it . ETTA struggling for breath.If she stays here I 'll go out afflicted as I am and shame you before the world . HARDY You and her stay , I 'll go . Yeh , I 'll go out as a harling somewhere for wages and you can let the land lie out and grow up in sheep-burrs and wire-grass . Savagely . And turn out the hogs in the fields and let the cows and mules into the barn and devour all I 've made like the locusts of Egypt . ETTA It 's come to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against you before , but I will now . If I am sickly and half dead , I wo n't give in . She 's got to leave . If she stays here it 'll be over my dead body and the curse of the Almighty I 'll put on you and her . Light footsteps are heard coming up the porch . MRS . GILCHRIST rises out of her seat and clings to the back of her chair . That 's her now , and I wo n't stay and look upon her face . Tomorrow  --  Going across the room to the door at the left rear . It 's your immortal soul , Hardy , and her soul I 'm thinking of . I 'm going to bed now . She goes into her room and closes the door . GILCHRIST , as if awed at her manner , sits staring intently after her . The door at the left rear opens and RHODA comes in . She is dressed in a becoming hat , dark coat-suit , and trim shoes . Her eyes are red with weeping. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HARDY starting.Nothing . She goes into her room at the left and takes off her hat and gloves . When she returns , GILCHRIST stands up and gets her a chair . Warm yourself , I 'll go out and put up the horse . CAMPBELL I stopped by the barn and put him up . HARDY Come back by yourself ? CAMPBELL I came back like I went  --  by myself . HARDY You had n't ought to have stopped out there in the cold and took out the horse . CAMPBELL sitting down. I thought you 'd be working at the meat still . Did you get it all fixed ? HARDY Yes , Mag and Lonie stayed and helped . CAMPBELL leaning over and looking at the churn.The milk 's turned . I believe it 'll churn now . HARDY You 've done enough for one day . Have a good time ? CAMPBELL with a strained little laugh.Not much . HARDY Was Neill there ? p. 71 CAMPBELL Yes . HARDY after a moment.What all did you play ? CAMPBELL " Fruit-basket " and " Put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that 's about all . HARDY a smile hovering around his lips.Wisht I 'd a-been there . We used to play another good game called " Weaving the Thimble . " CAMPBELL I 'm glad you wa' n't , myself . If you could have seen Neill . HARDY Still I hoped you could get him to come to his senses . CAMPBELL Where 's Aunt Etta ? HARDY Gone to bed . CAMPBELL bowing her head.Oh , Hardy ! HARDY I know . Presently . What you been crying about ? CAMPBELL Neill was there at the party , drunk , and he stood up in the middle of the floor and made a speech about me . She hides her face in her hands . HARDY Not you by yourself , Rhody ? CAMPBELL No , about you and me together  --  yes . p. 72 HARDY He 's rushing on to ruin . I hate to think of what 'll happen when he gets sober . He 'll want to kill hisself . I know him . CAMPBELL I could n't stand it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he say ? CAMPBELL He told everything he knew and more , and he hinted and winked about a whole lot of things . Twisting her hands nervously . Hardy , Jacob saw us in the hayfield that evening . He was passing along by the hedgerow . HARDY throwing out his hands.There you are  --  CAMPBELL Neill told all that right before the crowd . Jacob let him on to it this evening when you sent him down the road to see Neill . HARDY sitting down.Now , it 's getting too much , Rhody . Neill got drunk because he 's kinder lost faith in you and me , that 's it too . CAMPBELL I know it , and there ai n't a thing we can do to convince him different . HARDY Tomorrow it 'll be all over the neighborhood . Raising his voice as if imitating some one . There goes Hardy Gilchrist whose word has been his bond , a man among men , one I wanted my boys to pattern after . All the time I trusted him he was rotten as a wormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife  --  Groaning . Ah , Rhody , I 've lived on my good name . My strength and my good name is all I 've had . I 've thrown it away . p. 73 CAMPBELL convulsively catching his hand.And it 's all on account of me . I 've done it . He gestures . Now do n't , it 's true . HARDY It 's not your fault . We both have been weak . Etta says no man can make it alone . He 's got to have an everlasting arm around him . Mebbe she 's right , I do n't know . Reckon she 's right ? He pulls his hand from hers . CAMPBELL I do n't know . HARDY Nor I. CAMPBELL If we could just call back that one time . HARDY You wish it had n't happened ? CAMPBELL in a low voice. I 'll always remember it and be glad just the same . But it 's you I hate it for . HARDY I 'll always carry it with me , Rhody  --  the  --  the kiss you give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knee with his fist . I do n't care if all the angels in the sky said it was wrong I 'd know it wa' n't . CAMPBELL And I 'd know it wa' n't . HARDY straightening himself up.So le 's put it behind us , child . Let that day stand there like a pillar in our minds . p. 74 CAMPBELL in a hushed voice.The fields and the sweet hay and the sunset there  --  and  --  oh , it will be with me till I die . HARDY leaning towards her.Hush ! Hush ! He puts his hand on her shoulder and then suddenly draws it away . Tomorrow I 'll go down and talk to Neill and tell him everything . Mebbe he 'll understand . CAMPBELL And tomorrow I 'm going away never to come back . HARDY No , no , you ca n't . That wo n't settle it , Rhody . The only thing you can do is  --  to marry Neill . CAMPBELL I do n't love him . I ca n't marry him . HARDY We 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't want to  --  sometimes . CAMPBELL I 'd do anything you said for me to do but that . Marrying would n't fix it . Let me go away and folks will forget , and all can be like it was before I come . She stands up . HARDY Where 'd you go ? CAMPBELL the tears running down her cheeks.I 'll go back to town or somewhere and work , and I 'll leave all these fields and things behind . She stifles her sobs in her handkerchief . But I wo n't be able to get ' em out of my mind to save my soul . p. 75 HARDY A-ah , child , all could have been different for you and me . Abruptly . I do n't see no way but for you to marry him . I 'll build you and him any sort of house you want , and you can stay here on the farm where you want to be . CAMPBELL If you just knew how I feel and will to the grave , Hardy , you 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARDY brokenly.Yes , yes , and I love you . It 's you that I was made for . Suddenly he takes her in his arms and falls to kissing her . In a moment she pushes his face away and with her head against his breast stands clinging to him . GILCHRIST looks out before him . I do n't care what they do , they sha n't take you away from me . Let ' em talk and let ' em laugh and mock me , I 'll keep you before the whole world . CAMPBELL moaning and pushing him away.No , no . I 've got to go . Let this be the last , Hardy , forever . She looks up at him and , catching his face in her hands , rises on her tip-toes and kisses him . That 's for good-by now . HARDY recklessly.Then I 'll go too . I 'll go where you go and be with you . CAMPBELL No , no , let me loose . I 'll pack my trunk now . p. 76 HARDY following her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go with you , and we 'll leave it all to her in there . CAMPBELL opening the door.Aunt Etta . HARDY We 'll leave her to her God and her Bible . CAMPBELL shivering.After tonight I wo n't see you any more . Now leave me . She pushes him from her and moves into her room . HARDY Oh , Rhody ! CAMPBELL suddenly turning back and throwing her arms around his neck.I ca n't go from you . I 'll die without you . You 're my man , my god  --  everything to me . She kisses him in an abandonment of love and grief . HARDY hoarsely.You 're mine tonight , Rhody . CAMPBELL holding him by the hand.Yes , yes . Her face aflame . This night is mine ; it 's all I 'll have . She moves within the door , her eyes closed and her head bent down . HARDY softly.Rhody  --  p. 77 CAMPBELL looking about her in the room and whispering.The nights and nights I 've laid on that bed and thought of you . Oh , Hardy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stroking her hair . MRS . GILCHRIST opens her door and sees them . With a low cry she falls upon her knees . ETTA God have mercy upon their pore souls . She sinks moaning to the floor . HARDY springing around.Etta ! ETTA raising her head.Do n't touch me . Screaming . Keep your hands off of me ! Her head falls back against the floor . HARDY hurrying to her and picking her up in his arms.Are you hurt ? What is it , Etta ? He carries her into the bedroom and is heard laying her on the bed . CAMPBELL standing alone in the room.Oh , my Lord , what have we done ? ETTA moaning , within.You cursed and defiled  --  you black of heart , God will  --  Vengeance is mine saith the Lord . Ye are cursed with a curse . p. 78 HARDY sharply.Come here , Rhody , quick ! CAMPBELL horror-stricken.Aunt Etta . HARDY in a moment GILCHRIST comes back and takes the lamp from the table.Come on in , Rhody . Huskily . Did you hear her ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips , a curse for you and me , Rhody . He looks heavily around him . CAMPBELL bursting into sobs.We killed her , you and me ! Terror-stricken , they go into the room and stand by the bedside of the dead woman. @x The scene is the same as Act One , several months later . It is a late afternoon in summer . The china tree is in full leaf and the green cotton-fields stretch away to the left . Morning-glories have been planted along the porch , winding up the columns in leafy thickness , and the well has been replaced by a pump . MAG is at the tub washing . The wire running from the outhouse to the porch is hung with freshly washed clothes . MAG singing to herself with mournful introspection . Get up in the morning , Trouble bothers my mind , I go to bed at evening , It 's trouble all the time.Oh , I wisht I 'd heeded what my mammy said.Oh ,  --  and now I wisht that I was lying dead . He come by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to listen , Nothing to bother my mind.Oh , I wisht I 'd heeded what my mammy said.Oh ,  --  and now I wisht that I was lying dead . LONIE comes quietly in from the left rear and stands by the wash-bench . MAG starting.Lord , you skeered me , Lonie ! LONIE I thought I 'd come down and maybe help you . p. 80 MAG I 'm shore glad you did for I was lonesome as a graveyard here by myself . You can start washing in that tub . LONIE holding a garment up from her tub.Mis ' Etta 's dress , pore soul , ai n't it ? MAG Yeh , I found it back in the closet this morning . That dress brings it all back to me . It was a fair day when she put it on . She come out on the porch there and called to me and said look at it . And she had a little bit of lace on the collar or something . But , Lord , I could n't help seeing her pale face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONIE soaping the dress on the board.Reckon she sees me washing out her dress from up there ? MAG No doubt she does while she 's a-singing with her harp . It 's good they got music up there , for she did like to play and sing here below . LONIE Yeh , she did . After a moment . Seems quare , jest like I mought any minute feel her flesh inside this here dress . MAG Pime-blank the way I 've felt seeing her shoes setting about and her specs and snuffbox on the mantelpiece by the clock . And yistiddy I found a ball of her knitting with the needle stuck in it . p. 81 LONIE wheezily.Anh , everybody has to give up what they 're a-doing some day and stop it . MAG That they do . And dying wo n't keep things from going right on and on . They 'll be marrying and giving in marriage still . LONIE Yeh , they will . MAG If I ai n't mistook they 's a wedding going on some'er 's now . LONIE Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning about ten o'clock  --  Miss Rhody all dolled up in finery and looking like a queen and he with his black suit and starched collar and shirt on .

LONIE Yeh , yeh . MAG Still she had n't ort to mind now fer she 's dead and gone and nothing cai n't hurt her there . LONIE Hardy needs a wife like Miss Rhody. p. 82 MAG Well , I hope they 're gitting married for I do n't want to stay here another night . Looking intently at LONIE . I tell you I do n't . LONIE I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I ai n't gon na stay in there nary another ' un  --  listen ! Last night , Lonie , some time ' way in the night I woke up and could n't hardly breathe . They was somebody in the room ; I felt it . LONIE Nanh , nanh ! MAG I struck a light , but they war n't nobody there . Then I heard sump'n ' in the wall trying to git out . I could n't sleep another wink . And this morning the new plaster was cracked clean acrost . LONIE holding up the dead woman 's dress fearfully.Lordy ! They wash away in silence . LONIE wrings out MRS . GILCHRIST 'S dress and hangs it carefully on the line , the two sleeves stretched widely out and caught to the wire by clothespins . Presently old JACOB and his boy SION come around the house at the rear and sit down on the pump platform . JACOB carries a trowel and level in his hand and SION carries a shovel .

MAG You have ? JACOB Yeh . SION It shore is a purty ' un . JACOB With two hands a-shaking on it and a verse out under it saying " Asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and can rest till the judgment day . When we was done I said a little bit of a prayer over her , did n't I , Sion ? SION slicking down his hair.He stood up and prayed out loud .

And , folkses , they was married at the courthouse this morning . He slaps his leg with his hat . And here I set waiting to welcome the bride and groom , and Sion too . SION polishing his nails.Me too . JACOB sadly.Bad fer pore Sion to lose his sweetheart that-a-way . But you 'll git you another ' un , boy . You and Neill kin go out courting together now . p. 87 MAG Has Neill heard about ' em marrying ? JACOB I told him . MAG scornfully.Course you did . JACOB And he 's coming up to welcome ' em home .

Who would n't drink in sich a fix ? MAG If you 'd a-kept your long tongue out of it , him and Mr. Hardy would a-been friends ag'in long ago . JACOB angrily.Why , I 've talked to him and Hardy 's talked to him and it do n't do no good . He 's done quit old man Turner and do n't do nothin ' but lie in his daddy 's house and eat and sleep . He 's ruint fer good ! MAG And you helped ruin him , you and him off together drunk every two weeks . JACOB Not me , Mag .

MAG and LONIE hang out their last garment . JACOB Hooray ! MAG You 'd better stop that hooraying and go back home if you know what 's good fer you . SYKES The happy couple come yet ? JACOB Not yit . We 'll jest set and wait fer ' em . LONIE sits down on the wash-bench . MAG I 'm going in , Lonie , and tie up my clothes . I wo n't be needed hyuh tonight . JACOB chuckling.That you wo n't , Mag . Hardy and the gal will be enough  --  heh-heh . MAG goes up the porch and into the house . SYKES with a magnanimous wave of his arm.Come over hyuh , Jacob ! Come over , I got sump'n ' purty for you . And you too , Sion ! p. 89 JACOB Nanh-nanh , Neill , I 'd jest as leave set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on over , I tell you . They move over to him and sit down on the porch . NEILL pulls a large flask of whiskey from his pocket . How 's that for joy and singing at a wedding ! JACOB looking at LONIE.No , no , Neill , I cai n't now . I 've quit . SYKES Quit ! When , this morning ? Hyuh , if you do n't drink you ai n't my friend . He hands it to JACOB . JACOB Well , what kin a-body do ? We are commanded to be friends one with another . Spitting out his tobacco and uncorking the bottle . They was spirits at the wedding in Canaan , and here 's to everybody . He takes a deep drink . A-n-h ! SYKES taking it from him and drinking.Here 's to him and to her , by God ! He pushes the bottle into SION 'S hands . JACOB Heh-heh  --  I be danged , Neill . Yeh , hyuh 's to ' em . SYKES Drink some o ' this far and git some color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face crawling in pain under the burning liquor. p. 90 JACOB Hyuh , hyuh , that 's enough . He lifts the bottle from him and drinks again . MAG suddenly bursts out of the house carrying a bundle of clothes in her hand . MAG Lord-a-mercy ! JACOB What'n the world has happened ? MAG dropping down on the pump platform.I seed a sight that chilled me to the bone . JACOB Was it a ghost or what ? MAG When I come out of her room with my clothes , there sot Mis ' Etta playing the orgin . JACOB giving a squeak.Nanh , nanh , you could n't . MAG And when I looked ag'in she was gone . LONIE in a low throaty voice.She cai n't rest in her grave . JACOB drinking from the bottle and appealing to NEILL.It ai n't so , do n't you know t'ai n't so ? SYKES springing up and waving his hat.Hooray fer the wedding ! Now we 'll have a grand reception . The old woman 's come back from her grave to help welcome ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heard down the lane . NEILL staggers to the left of the house and stands looking off around behind it . He comes back into the yard . Yonder they come burning the wind . A-ah , but they 're in a hurry . Brandishing his bottle . It 's love , love burning ' em up and driving ' em on . The buggy draws up and stops before the house . SION suddenly begins to cry . JACOB gives him a drunken punch. p. 91 JACOB Stop it , boy , there comes Miss Rhody . You do n't want to let her see you . SION snuffles in his sleeve . They listen and RHODA is heard entering the house at the front . MAG Come on , Lonie , le 's leave hyuh . LONIE gets up and follows her across the yard . Neill , you and Jacob better go on away from hyuh . RHODA comes down the porch at the right wearing a long gray clinging dress and a pale green scarf thrown over her shoulders . She starts back on seeing NEILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going , Mag ? MAG I 've got all my things tied up here and I 'm going . You wo n't need me tonight , will you ? JACOB bursts into a guffaw . CAMPBELL looking at him sharply.All right . Did you get through the wash ? MAG Yes 'm . Hurriedly . Come on , Lonie , le 's git away . They go quickly off at the left . RHODA stands looking after them perplexed . SYKES Where 's the happy groom ? p. 92 CAMPBELL brushing her hand across her face.Hardy 's putting up the horse , Neill . Is there anything I can do for you and Jacob ? SYKES Not by a damn sight ! JACOB winking.No 'm , Neill and me and Sion jest want to bid you welcome into the holy state of matrimony . Do n't we , Sion ? SION giggling drunkenly through his tears.Merry Christmas to you , Miss Rhody . He leans against a post slobbering and his tongue hanging out . CAMPBELL You 've been giving him liquor , Neill ? SYKES waving his bottle.We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And wo n't you join with us to celebrate ? JACOB Wedding and love  --  heh-heh . CAMPBELL shrinking back against the wall.Stop it , please . Oh , Neill , please go away before Hardy comes in . SYKES clinging to the porch post.What 's wrong with me ? Ai n't I sober as a judge , sober as that damned Hardy Gilchrist you 'll sleep with tonight ? RHODA covers her face with her hands and moves up the porch. p. 93 JACOB Course he 's sober , we 're all sober . And they ai n't no harm in tasting a drap to you . SYKES And this is my farewell party to everybody . I 've joined Uncle Sam 's men and tomorrow I 'm going to the army . And I got my gatling gun with me . He pulls out a pistol and brandishes it in the air . JACOB Gon na be a soldier , Neill ? Hooray  --  fight fer your country . He eyes NEILL foolishly . SYKES putting the pistol back in his pocket.I signed up yistiddy in Dunn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexicans . He suddenly waves his bottle like a saber and marches up and down the yard singing . Tramp , tramp , tramp , the boys are marching . He makes a drunken salute and then waves his hands unsteadily over the fields . What 's in this farming and sweating your insides out ? Nothing . It 's war for me in the service of the flag . I hate them fields out there . I hate everybody . I hate Hardy Gilchrist and all he 's done to me . I hope to God trouble comes on him like hail out'n the sky till it beats him to the earth as low-down as me . His voice breaking in drunken sobs . He 's laid awake at night and hatched his plans and sot his steel-trap to ketch me in . Jacob knows he has . And he 's caught me all right . I 'm down hyuh lower'n a nigger and he 's up there with his woman like God A'mighty on the throne . p. 94 CAMPBELL moaning.Oh , Neill , do n't , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces against the side of the outhouse.He 's plowed me in the fields like a damned old steer , night and day he 's drove me on in a yoke with him . I 've dug in his bottoms , and rooted up stumps a ' engine could n't budge and dug in his ditches and cut away his briars and hedges for him . And all the time he 's sot back and smiled at his eating me up in his hopper . Look at his hogs and mules and corn and his hay piled up higher'n a barn and his money rusting in a bank  --  I helped make it , these hyuh two arms piled it up for him . Spitting . A-ah , he takes all and leaves me nothing . Singing . Tramp , tramp , tramp , the boys are marching , Cheer up , comrades , they will come . Old JACOB takes up the song and begins marching with him . RHODA runs into the house and shuts the door behind her . Presently NEILL stops and puts his hands to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking out at the fields.He 's done me the same way , Neill , the same way . Hyuh I 've lived on his land fer ten long year and what have I got ? Durn his black soul . Me'n Nancy ai n't got nothing , nothing . Sion there 'll be left a pore boy without a cent in the world . A-ah , he 's et the fat of the land and fed us the husks and crumbs . God is hard on the pore harlings and tenants . GILCHRIST is heard entering the house. p. 95 SYKES Come on , there 's the bridegroom coming in to the bride . He pulls SION up and starts across the yard towards the rear . JACOB Leave ' em alone  --  heh-heh . NEILL stops and looks around him . He points to the outhouse door . SYKES Le 's git in there . I ai n't gon na leave him yit . We 'll come out and serenade the devil torectly . JACOB We 'll watch ' em  --  heh-heh . After much clambering and pushing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHODA come down the porch . HARDY Where is he ? CAMPBELL Do n't say anything to him , Hardy . He 's drunk and out of his head almost and he 's got a pistol . HARDY Never mind that . Looking around . They all must have gone . He steps down in the yard and walks to the end of the house . JACOB . CAMPBELL They 've gone , thank the Lord . RHODA comes down into the yard and stands beside GILCHRIST . I 'd give anything if he was back our friend again . Clinging to GILCHRIST . Oh , it just makes me feel awful to think of him . If he could just forgive us and be at peace ! p. 96 HARDY Aye , I 'd like for everybody to be at peace today , tonight . They stand looking out over the cotton-fields towards the red of the sunset . From behind a small cloud that hangs above the pines to the west the light from the hidden sun spreads up across the sky like the spangles of a great exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd like for all the hard words and the bitterness to be wiped out everywhere . It 's like ashes in my mouth to think of Neill . CAMPBELL Maybe he 'll come back from the army with it all forgot . HARDY The army ! CAMPBELL He 's going off tomorrow . HARDY Anh , worse and worse . The army . I 'll miss him and them fields 'll miss him . And as for him he ca n't never forget ' em . Still , maybe it 's for the best . Now let 's go in , go into our house , your house and mine . CAMPBELL Our house . They step up on the porch and GILCHRIST turns and looks out at the fields and sky , RHODA leaning against him . HARDY Try to forget all the trouble now . I 'll take care of you . CAMPBELL I ought not to feel afraid . But every now and then I feel like a cold breath of wind comes over me  --  feel afraid somehow . p. 97 HARDY You just imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your mind . CAMPBELL I 'll try . I will , Hardy . HARDY Somehow I feel almost like believing in Etta 's God tonight , Rhody . CAMPBELL I do , I do too . HARDY Look at that sky full of glory over there , Rhody , and the trees reaching around the fields like shutting off all the world for you and me . CAMPBELL Yes , yes . HARDY looking up at the sky.If they 's any place up there beyond the stars like Etta believed , I know she sees us and is satisfied . CAMPBELL She ca n't hold it against us any longer . I know she ca n't . HARDY No . For now she understands and knows we 've never meant no harm . She sees how hard it 's been for you and me , what we 've suffered and gone through with all these months . CAMPBELL And we 'll still have to suffer , Hardy . HARDY Ah , that we will . People will go on talking , but we 'll live it down . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to the poor and the afflicted and this house shall be like a well of kindness in a weary land . p. 98 CAMPBELL It will , Hardy , we 'll make it so . HARDY exultantly.And in these fields we 'll toil and labor and bring forth a hundredfold and more , With a wide gesture of his arm. toiling and sweating and happy for the joy and the life that 's in us , Rhody . CAMPBELL with a broken sob.I could die with you now just about , and not be sorry . HARDY holding her tightly to him.And we 'll raise up sons and daughters , Rhody , many of'em , as strong and solid as that dirt out there . And we 'll go down into the grave , them blessing us . He bends his head over her , and then bows down brokenly , clasping his arms around her knees . Oh , God , or spirit  --  if there is one up there or anywhere  --  look down on us and hear our prayer . Remember not our transgressions , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the image of the Most High . And  --  oh , Etta , Etta , be at peace and be merciful , for now we are happy His voice dying out. happy at last . He bends his head and kisses the hem of RHODA 'S dress . CAMPBELL leaning over him , her body shaken with sobs.Do n't do n't not that oh , you are great and wonderful and I am nothing . A little gale of mocking laughter trickles out of the outhouse . In a moment it sounds again. p. 99 HARDY standing up in horror.What 's that ? Who 's out there ? In the silence the chickens are heard flapping their wings and making muffled noises on the roost . CAMPBELL It was the chickens going to roost . HARDY looking about.I thought I heard somebody . Maybe it was nothing . Bending tenderly over her . Le 's go in now , honey . With his arm around her they go up the porch . Again the laughter breaks across the yard . GILCHRIST starts back as if struck . Who 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outhouse door opens and NEILL , old JACOB and SION tumble out . NEILL has a guano trumpet in his hand and old JACOB carries the joint of a stovepipe . They are drunker than ever . SYKES Hooray for the bride and groom ! JACOB Hooray . NEILL blows a blast upon his trumpet , old JACOB beats the stovepipe , and SION claps his hands . SYKES We 've come to serenade you . They stagger up and down the yard blowing and beating . SION makes his way over to the bellpost and leans against it slobbering. p. 100 HARDY shouting above the din.Neill , stop that foolishness ! SYKES lowering his trumpet and leering up at them.My best wishes to you . I hope you have a warm bed and great joy . GILCHRIST starts out of the porch , but RHODA clings to him . JACOB The same here , Hardy , with all my heart . SYKES May God A'mighty set a burning mark on you and give you no peace and send you a gang of children with the head of calves . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! Yea , I hope they 'll be snake-headed , for you 're both snakes in the grass ! JACOB beating on his stovepipe.Heh-heh-heh , and die without a roof over they heads . HARDY groaning and throwing out his hands.So be it . I wo n't hit you , for I know it 's tearing in your liver , Neill , and you 're drunk . A-ah , Jacob . Le 's go in , Rhody . He bows his head and he and RHODA go up the porch and into the house . NEILL and his companions fall to their blowing and beating again . SYKES shouting.You two dirty whores ! GILCHRIST rushes out through the door and down the porch , and then stops again , staring at them . Shouting . You two dirty whores ! Hawgs and whores , God damn you ! He marches up and down the yard singing . Tramp , tramp , tramp , the boys are marching He pulls out his pistol and suddenly shoots himself in the breast , falling heavily in the yard . JACOB stands looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins tolling the bell. p. 101 JACOB Heh-heh  --  what you doing like that fer , Neill ? HARDY rushing down the porch.What  --  Great God ! ' Rhody , Rhody , Neil 's shot hisself ! He hurries into the yard and bends down beside him . In a moment he turns away and stares at the ground . JACOB stands looking on in amazement , his mouth open and slobbering , tapping with his stick as if in a dream . RHODA comes slowly down the porch , her face hid in her scarf . GILCHRIST looks at her in anguish . Rhody , he 's gone . CAMPBELL sitting suddenly down on the edge of the porch.Oh , I ca n't look at it . She bows her head in her lap , weeping and moaning . HARDY screaming at JACOB.Stop that beating . Sion ! SION stands looking at him terrified . Presently he begins to sob . JACOB comprehends what has happened , and with a howl of terror scrambles out at the left rear . GILCHRIST raises his head and looks at ETTA 'S dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moves blindly towards him. p. 102 Act 3 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 The scene is the GILCHRIST sitting-room nearly a year later . The room is furnished much as before except that a center table with a vase of flowers takes the place of the organ , a new bureau with a mirror has been placed at the left , and a few sprays of budding branches are placed decoratively in pots in the corners of the room . It is a cold Sunday in Spring , and a log fire is smoldering in the fireplace . RHODA GILCHRIST , dressed in a loose wrapper , her hair hanging down in two shining braids , sits leaning over a baby 's cradle before the fire . Her face is drawn and pale . After a moment she rises and stares about her uncertainly . Finally she moves over to the door at the right rear , stands as if listening and then turns and takes up the Bible from the table with a touch of furtiveness , opens it and sits down reading . Every now and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are audible as she reads . CAMPBELL " and said Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not . " Ah , me ! She clutches at her brow and goes on reading . " Whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child " Her voice dies into a mumble . Presently Hardy GILCHRIST comes quietly in at the rear . He is dressed in his Sunday best , his hair combed back , his dark clothes pressed and neat save for splotches of mud on his shoes . The passing months have deepened certain lines of grimness in his face . As he enters , RHODA looks up startled and lets the Bible slide to the floor . You 've come back soon , Hardy . p. 103 HARDY his face softening as he glances at her.Yes . He looks down at the baby in the crib a moment and sighs . Poor little fellow . He bends down to listen and then lifts his head and stares in the distance . Ah  --  well . Reaching in the crib and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink any of it yet ? RHODA shakes her head and looks hungrily at him . GILCHRIST sets the bottle up on the mantelpiece and comes over behind her chair and smoothes her forehead gently . Do n't worry , honey child . CAMPBELL clutching his hand.He 's not had an ounce of food in two days . You did n't go . HARDY You do like the doctor said and quit worrying , and in a little bit you 'll be so you can nurse him . CAMPBELL I wish so . HARDY I do n't worry ; you must n't . CAMPBELL Hardy . HARDY Maybe some but not much . Forget it now . Come and rest yourself . He sits down in a rocking chair and takes her in his arms , soothing her . She closes her eyes and as he looks down at her a haggard restless look comes over his face . He begins abstractedly pushing his hand through his hair. p. 104 CAMPBELL looking up.Something  --  now , look , you 're worrying again . She watches him intently . And you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAMPBELL sitting up straight in his lap.Sometimes it seems you ought to hate me . HARDY smiling at her. Do n't be foolish , child , rest yourself against me . CAMPBELL All the time we were planning about him , strong and healthy , and then he comes so little and weak . It was my fault . HARDY soberly.It 's not that , hush . Oh , then so many things kept worrying you . CAMPBELL And I could n't help it , I love you so . HARDY restlessly.We both worried too much . CAMPBELL catching his face between her hands.Reckon we 'll ever get things straightened out the way we thought ? HARDY Sure we will . CAMPBELL staring at him searchingly.Are you keeping something from me again , Hardy ? p. 105 HARDY Why should I ? CAMPBELL You talk strong that way every time something happens . Has anything else happened ? HARDY caressing her.And every time I go out you think something bad has happened or is going to happen . CAMPBELL And I have reason to . HARDY Hanh ?  --  Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from church so soon ? HARDY I have n't been to church , Rhody . CAMPBELL Why you said you 'd go . HARDY I started , but I did n't go . CAMPBELL It was to be a big day for you , Hardy , all the people there to pray and try to help you , help you and me . HARDY Did you want me to go and be prayed over ? CAMPBELL I do n't know . I do n't know what I want . Timidly . Maybe it 'd help some . Oh , I do n't know . HARDY decisively.No , I decided not to go . Let them go on and follow after their God and I 'll follow mine . p. 106 CAMPBELL leaning against him.Somehow I wanted you to go , maybe for the baby 's sake , I do n't know . HARDY What you mean ? CAMPBELL After what the preacher said yesterday I wanted you to go over there , I think I did . HARDY And I 'd a-been weak if I had gone . CAMPBELL Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't , Rhody . Only with strength can we make it clean right on to the end . CAMPBELL I hope we can make it . HARDY buoyantly.Sure , poor child . Reading the Bible ? CAMPBELL I 'm always lonesome when you 're away . I picked it up . HARDY Well  --  yes , I might a-gone to church , but I went by the pasture to see about the big hog . CAMPBELL Is he better ? HARDY I suppose so . Grimly . He was lying in the pen dead as a door-knob . CAMPBELL Oh , Hardy . She looks at him a long while . Whispering . It keeps being that way . p. 107 HARDY with a faint touch of anger.I 've had cholera to kill my hogs off before . He pulls her tight in his arms . Lay your head on my shoulder and go to sleep . Everything is quiet and just us here , forget everything . CAMPBELL starting up. I felt something sharp in your pocket . She reaches into his pocket and pulls out a butcher-knife . HARDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I saw it lying there where I throwed it in the field that day  --  it all come back to me  --  and would I go to church ? CAMPBELL uncertainly.Maybe . HARDY My mind was so full of things I had no mind for their God , I tell you . RHODA gets up from his lap and sits in a chair . Soon GILCHRIST rises , lays the knife on the mantel , and reseats himself in his chair . Again for a moment his face is filled with a somber brooding . CAMPBELL watching the knife.I do n't like for it to be up there . HARDY starting.All right . He gets the knife down and holds it undecidedly in his hand. p. 108 CAMPBELL Burn it up . He looks at her sharply and then throws the knife into the fire . HARDY You ca n't burn it up , nothing but the handle . The blade is steel . Looking at the baby . He never cries , poor little man . CAMPBELL He 's never had the strength . HARDY taking off his coat.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes into the room at the left and reappears with his work-clothes in his hands . CAMPBELL I wish you would n't go . HARDY I 'll be back purty soon . Mag 'll keep you company . CAMPBELL She 's gone home a minute to look after Lonie . HARDY dropping his clothes again in the room at the left.All right . He stands a moment thinking . Abstractedly he rolls up his sleeve and runs his hand back and forth along his forearm . His face darkens again with shaggy introspection . CAMPBELL smiling with mournful teasingness.You 're just about the strongest man in the world , I bet . p. 109 HARDY quickly.And the weakest , like today , for instance . CAMPBELL coming over to him and putting her arms around his neck.That was my fault . I 'm sorry . You 're strong , stronger than any man almost as strong as God himself . HARDY kissing her.You make me strong . He hugs her to him and puts his face against her hair . The door at the left rear opens cautiously and old JACOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in ? HARDY releasing RHODA.Come on in . Old JACOB comes in , followed by SION . They are both dressed in their preaching clothes . JACOB with an old seedy brown suit , a collar without a tie and a brown derby . SION wears the same clothes as before , and his hair still keeps its greasy curls . They respectfully sit down near the fire , and HARDY reseats himself . SION at once begins to polish his fingernails and arrange his hair with his little looking-glass . JACOB How 's little Hardy coming on ? CAMPBELL No better . p. 110 JACOB Ah , that 's bad . HARDY Oh , yes . JACOB Hanh ? HARDY It 's bad , of course . JACOB Oh , yeh , as I said . HARDY stands up , turns moodily about the room , and sits down again . The eyes of JACOB and RHODA follow him . HARDY You gon na be here long , Jacob ? JACOB I du n no , I mought . HARDY I got to go up and bury my big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . JACOB Great goodness , is your prize hog dead , too ? HARDY Yes , dead Echoing. " too . " JACOB with a groan.Anh ! HARDY And " anh . " JACOB Warnings on top o ' warnings . HARDY snapping his fingers.Yes , yes , all the time warnings ! JACOB studying.When 'd you find him dead ? HARDY ' Bout half a ' hour ago . p. 111 JACOB raising his eyes sanctimoniously aloft.And I know what 's behind it . HARDY Yes , you do . CAMPBELL There 's nothing behind it . JACOB You do n't go to church , and a sign comes . CAMPBELL Stop now , Jacob . JACOB And why did n't you come to church ? Everybody was there and we waited fer you and they all said you 'd come fer they knowed you was a man of your promise . HARDY suddenly striking his thigh.There again ! JACOB And then you did n't and we sent up a hundred prayers for your soul , did n't we , Sion ? SION morosely.They prayed and prayed . HARDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be delivered from the curse of yer transgression . HARDY Jacob , I 'd be much obliged if you 'd go on now and leave us . JACOB I 'm going then , but they 's others 'll not go so easy . If you 'd a-heard that preacher it 'd a-melted yer heart . p. 112 HARDY He come here yesterday to melt my heart . JACOB Yeh , and he jest about had ye marching to the house of God . HARDY Not him  --  mebbe . CAMPBELL I asked him to go . JACOB You ?  --  Thank the Lord . CAMPBELL I knew he 'd go over there and stand up to you all . JACOB watching her.Ah , it was enough to break down a heart of stone to see the brethren and sistern weeping over yer lost estate . My own eyes still burn from they tears . GILCHRIST stares at the floor saying nothing . And the preacher is on his way here with a committee to wrastle with yer unforgiving sperit , Hardy . HARDY Here ? JACOB They 're coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hog . He stands up . CAMPBELL her face hardening.Let them come on . Show them who you are . Suddenly fighting back the tears . It 's not right for them to worry you so . They do n't know you . It 's a sin for them to torment you , and you the best man in the world . Turning to JACOB , the tears beginning to pour down her face . Why , he is , Jacob . You know he is . Look how much good his does for people . And God himself could be no better to me . Hotly . It 's because he 's got more sense than all of them put together , and is better . She finally controls herself and stares at old JACOB malignantly. p. 113 JACOB stirring uneasily.Oh , yes , good in a world'y way . But that wo n't save yer soul  --  plenty o ' heathens is good , Mis ' Rhody . HARDY suddenly shaking himself.I ought to 've gone to church . CAMPBELL And I ought not to 've asked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and answered ' em word for word , argument for argument , they could n't a-beat me down . Broodingly . I do n't know , Rhody , maybe I  --  She looks at him , saying nothing . JACOB angrily.You can throw off on us pore folks , Mis ' Rhody , but the preacher 's got plenty of sense and he 'll speak fer us . HARDY Yes , let ' em come on and talk to me . MAG comes in suddenly from the rear , wearing an old cape over her head . MAG They 's some folks coming up the lane there  --  My , it 's beginning to rain outside . CAMPBELL Mag , roll him in the other room . MAG rolling the baby into the room at the left.Come on , precious . He sleeps and sleeps . p. 114 CAMPBELL shivering and drawing a cloak up from the depths of her chair around her shoulders.It 's cold to be in April . GILCHRIST starts and stirs the fire . HARDY Jacob , I 'd be much obliged if you 'd leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand to be where I ai n't wanted . Come on , Sion . SION puts away his mirror and follows him . At the rear door JACOB turns and looks back . They ai n't nobody prayed fer ye harder'n me , Hardy . HARDY impassively.Much obliged . JACOB and SION go out . GILCHRIST stands punching the fire with the toe of his shoe , leaning his elbow on the mantel . Look , Rhody , that knife-blade 's red-hot . CAMPBELL Yes . HARDY tapping his lips.It looks like a long finger stuck out  --  even like a body lying straight in the fires o ' hell . CAMPBELL as MAG returns.You can go on and cook dinner now , Mag . MAG All right 'm . She picks up a straw broom from the chimney corner and sweeps the hearth. p. 115 HARDY How 's Lonie today ? MAG She sets looking at the fire , that 's all . HARDY Ah ! MAG Yes , that 's all . She goes out at the rear . HARDY I ought to 've gone to the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on into the other room and let ' em talk to me alone . CAMPBELL A long time ago you said my place was with you . HARDY kissing her with sudden fervor.And it is Ah , I do n't know how I lived them years without you . CAMPBELL putting her hands on his head.And do n't let me ever fail you . HARDY flinging out his hands suddenly. I could stand anything , have stood it . When it comes to people like them out there  --  good and kind and wanting to help us  --  then  --  well  --  I do n't know , I do n't know , I tell you . Intensively . Why , Rhody , they 're my own people , my folks . They love me and I love them . We know one another . All the year and last year a kind of wall has been growing up between us . Half to himself . I got to break it down somehow . p. 116 CAMPBELL If they loved you would they hurt you so ? HARDY smiling and shaking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they love us they hurt us ? Running the words over . Love and suffering , love and suffering so we know it well . HARDY We 're all alike down deep . I used to say so . Something in our heads we got , something different , God 's maybe principles we follow after  --  I 've thought about it a heap . CAMPBELL uncertainly.Theirs is in heaven , ours nearer with us , like we prayed on the porch that evening . And a great gulf as far as to the sky divides them . HARDY Yes , here with us Wisht we could go on believing . CAMPBELL We can . HARDY abruptly.I do n't know . CAMPBELL Hardy . HARDY going to the window at their right.Old Aunt Margaret comes there tramping in the rain . She nursed my mother the night I was born and come and help lay her out when she died . And every meeting year after year she 's sent up a prayer for my soul . She 's put her own boys away in the graveyard and loves me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mis ' Jones and Mis ' Jermigan with her . They 've all suffered and followed their God to the tomb . And the preacher leads ' em , the preacher coming here to gather my soul into heaven . And he 's a good man , a thousand times better than me . He 'd lay down his life for our little boy in there even and I would n't . Turning back into the room with a despairing gesture . Ah , there you are . p. 117 CAMPBELL Push it back from you . HARDY Who could fight against ' em when they 've suffered so ? Like me they 've suffered . Yea , more , and I feel for ' em and they feel for me . Steps are heard coming up the porch at the left front . A knock sounds on the door and GILCHRIST calls : Come in ! Three old women enter at the left front dressed in their crude Sunday clothes , their faces hid under big black slat-bonnets . The preacher , a thin middle-aged man with a pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap baggy clothes and carries a Bible in his hands . Without a word the women pass by GILCHRIST , clasp his hand a moment and look beseechingly up into his face with eyes red from weeping . Then they move on to RHODA , kiss her on the forehead , and get down on their knees in different parts of the room , bending their heads over on the seats of chairs and praying silently . GILCHRIST looks about him in consternation , makes a gesture of supplication towards them and then turns to RHODA , but she suddenly hides her face in her hands , crushed under their gentleness . He motions the preacher to a chair and sits down holding his head in his hand . PREACHER quietly.We 've been moved to come to ye , Brother Gilchrist . HARDY I 'm sorry . p. 118 PREACHER We 've had a great outpouring of the spirit at the church today . God said come . He smiles at GILCHRIST wanly . HARDY kindly.Thank you , we both thank you . OLD MARGARET at her chair , whispering.Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PREACHER We want to read a word of scripture and have a prayer with ye . He looks at GILCHRIST pleadingly . HARDY I do n't know  --  CAMPBELL Yes , let him , Hardy . GILCHRIST bows his head in acquiescence , and the PREACHER opens his Bible . PREACHER pulling at his collar.These are the words of God , not my words , brother . Though his words be like goads to the flesh , blessed be his holy name , they are just and full of mercy . For he hath said again and again that the proud heart goeth before destruction and the haughty spirit before a fall . Reading . " A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth . And a word spoken in due season , how good it is . The way of life is above to the wise , that he may depart from hell beneath . More loudly . The Lord will destroy the house of the proud ; but he will establish the border of the widow . His voice breaking in the room clear and bell-like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord ; but the words of the pure are pleasant words . He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house , but he that hateth gifts shall live . The heart of the righteous studieth to answer ; but the mouth of the weeked poureth out evil things . The Lord is far from the weeked ; but he heareth the prayer of the righteous . The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart ; and a good report maketh the bones fat . The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise . He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul ; but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding . The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom ; and before honor is humility . " JACOB and SION have crept in at the rear . The PREACHER closes the Bible . Let us pray . He gets down on his knees and JACOB does likewise . SION looks on with his mouth agape and finally he bows down . RHODA and GILCHRIST sit bent over in their seats. p. 119 HARDY softly.Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She makes no reply as the PREACHER begins to pray . PREACHER O Lord , come down now and be close to us and hear our prayer , give us strength , give our word strength , let it bring forth fruit from the heart of this man and this woman . OLD MARGARET twisting her head against her chair.O Lord , do , Lord , adder these hyuh many years ! PREACHER Day in and day out , night after night , we have called upon thee to bring these erring children , man and woman , man and wife in thy sight , towards thy holy throne . Thy ways are past understanding and we needs must continue to pray , holding on to thy promise , beseeching thee to save these for whom our hearts do ache and bleed . Old JACOB and the women answer with deep groans . Thou sawest the tears of thy children shed for them today , thou sendest thy holy spirit down to seal our hearts and give the message unto us . And we have obeyed thee , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . And it please thy blessed name we shall not go away until thou hast sentest thy blessing to this afflicted house . Yea , Lord ! Yea , Lord ! OLD MARGARET Amen . The others answer her . Hardy , ca n't ye see how we love ye and her ! p. 120 HARDY Rhody , please do n't stay in here . PREACHER his voice gathering strength.And thou hast promised thy wrath to them who sit in the seat of the scornful . Listen , Lord . OLD MARGARET Do , Lord . Save my boy . THE OTHERS Do , Lord . PREACHER Listen to our prayer , to the voice of thy children crying out of this dark world towards the gates of the New Jerusalem . Answer us and send thy power on this man . Touch him with thy finger that he may know thee as God , the very God , the Most High , the ruler of the firmament , the Alpha and Omega and the Great I Am . For thou art all good , all kind , and lovest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . You love them the way they love their little boy ! OLD MARGARET with a low moan.Yea , Lord . The two women and JACOB groan and mumble after her . PREACHER beginning to beat on the floor with his hands.Thou hast sentest warning and warning to him and he heeded them not . And woe , woe , woe , when thy wrath is loosed in the judgment day . For it is all prophesied and promised to them that forget God . Thou gavest him a saintly wife for ten years and five and she wrestled with his soul to bring it to the fold of thy salvation . And on her dying bed she warned him and he heeded her not . Yea , his proud spirit sent her to her grave . GILCHRIST jerks up his head . And who knows why he heeded her not ? Yea , even so , she died so suddenly ! The neighbors came and found her dead and another woman beside him . Lord , if there 's evil hid away there make him confess and bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop it ! HARDY standing up and then sitting again.Great God ! JACOB Lord , thou wilt bring all that is hid away to light . PREACHER slashing his arms around him.Thou canst see into his heart , whe'r it 's all black and vile there , what thoughts he 's had , what he 's planned in the night , for thou seest all . OLD MARGARET turning and embracing GILCHRIST 's feet.Confess it all , Hardy , clean out yer heart and save yer pore soul . He stares at her uncomprehendingly , shaking his head now and then as if trying to rid himself of a dream . PREACHER And thou hast seen it all and marked it all . Thou hast set a curse upon him since the day Sister Etta , a saint of God , died in this house . And yet thou lovest him , we all do . Thou sentest a young man , pore soul , who took his own life as a warning and still this man heeded thee not . HARDY hoarsely.Spare me something . PREACHER He heeded thee not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we thy children see thy wrath breaking upon him and breaking upon us . He wrings his hands and twists about the floor , his voice rising into a croon now and then , and the tears wetting his cheeks . The lightning came in the summer and struck his barns as a message of thy wrath . His crops begun to fail him and disease has come among his cattle and his stock . Wildly . Yea , thou art God of all things and there 's none beside thee . Crucify him , Lord , until he sees the light . I would I could be crucified in his stead , but he must save himself and die unto salvation . He hesitates a moment as if listening for a message , and then his voice breaks forth jubilantly . I hear you , Lord , and receive thy word . Yea , thou wilt continue to persecute him , thou sendest me thy promise . Stretch him on the rack , for it is the way to his salvation . Already thou hast laid hand on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to make his proud heart yield . For he 's a murderer , murderer ! His voice sharp as a knife . And we know it , his neighbors know it ! p. 122 THE WOMEN Oh , Lord , ha ' mercy ! PREACHER Yea , he stands condemned as a murderer , a destroyer of life . So is he in the minds of his people . And so he will stand until he do confess and humble himself before Almighty God . As thou hast said , " Will a man rob God ? Yet ye have robbed me . " In a hollow voice . " Ye are cursed with a curse ; for ye have robbed me , even  --  " CAMPBELL Have mercy on us , have mercy . She rises from her seat , turns helplessly about and then flees into the room at the left . GILCHRIST pays no attention to her , but sits rocking his head from side to side . The women suddenly burst forth in a frenzy of lamentation and prayer : " Lordy , Lord , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him , Jesus , save him . Let us have the light  --  the light for the darkness  --  tear the scales from his eyes  --  have mercy ! " The preacher leans his head over on the floor shivering . JACOB beginning to clap his hands.Thy will , Holy Father , thy will be done . His voice choking with sobs . Save him , Our Father , save Hardy Gilchrist from the burning pit . MAG comes in from the rear , watches a moment wide-eyed and then goes quickly out . SION sits back on his heels looking on , and now and then he wipes the tears from his eyes with his dirty handkerchief . The PREACHER on his knees feels blankly around him , touches a chair and leans weakly against it , mopping his face with trembling hands . OLD MARGARET breaks forth into loud screams , and rising to her feet , throws her arms ecstatically around GILCHRIST , hugging him to her breast. p. 123 OLD MARGARET Glory to God ! Glory to God ! Hardy , boy , cai n't ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yer pore mother is up there , Etta 's up there watching for ye to come to God . She falls on his neck weeping piteously . The other women come and crouch down at his feet . OLD MARGARET raises GILCHRIST 'S head and looks him in the face . Look at me , Hardy , look at the tears all of us is shedding fer ye . You 're my little boy and my pore old heart aches fer ye . HARDY brokenly.Do n't , Aunt Margaret . Catching her hands hungrily and staring at them . Pore hands that worked for me , cared for me  --  Oh , God ! OLD MARGARET And they will to the end . Sobbing . They ai n't nothing I would n't do fer ye , boy . I love ye better'n my own , that 's dead and gone . I 'm a mother to ye . HARDY convulsively.Mother ! OLD MARGARET falling on her knees and laying her head in his lap.Son ! My son , my boy ! Her bonnet is pushed back and GILCHRIST gently touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands over her head , feverishly clasping his. p. 124 PREACHER turning and crying out.A man who mought be a prophet among us . Purify him , Lord , and let him lead ! THE OTHERS Let him go before us . PREACHER And we will stand with him in that great day . Shouting . In that great day that 's coming . Standing up and beginning to sing : There 's a great day a-coming , a great day a-coming , There 's a great day a-coming by and by . The women climb to their feet singing and clapping their hands . When the saints and the sinners shall be parted right and left  --  Are you ready for that day to come ? Old JACOB rises to his feet singing . SION clambers up after him , his fresh voice rising beautiful and clear . The song mounts into a high mournful harmony as the singers draw up and encircle GILCHRIST . Are you ready ? Are you ready ? Are you ready for that day to come ? Are you ready ? Are you ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly stands up and looms above them . There 's a sad day a-coming , a sad day a-coming , There 's a sad day a-coming by and by , When the sinner shall hear his doom , " Depart , I know ye not ! " Are you ready for that day to come ? p. 125 HARDY his face pale and drawn.Stop it , let me say something  --  His words piling out , low and vehement . I do n't want her to know it , I do n't want Rhody to hear . But it 's been eating in me  --  here  --  Striking his breast . I been trying to get away from it . I do n't know what to do about it . I 've tried to pray  --  PREACHER Bless the Lord ! HARDY It wo n't come right  --  I know there 's something wrong somewhere . I do n't let her know  --  do n't let her know . I hold up strong before her  --  I keep fighting  --  fighting without the light seems like  --  and things keep going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try me no more , leave me to myself . I got to see it for myself  --  OLD MARGARET watches him happily , her toothless jaws trembling with eagerness . PREACHER God can clear it up . HARDY going on monotonously.Everything is all mixed up , my head seems all dead and cold  --  I keep lying awake at night  --  I do n't tell her  --  I do n't let her know  --  I keep trying and saying we 'll make it  --  I got to think it out , there 's a way out  --  Last night I saw a thousand faces looking at me . Half whining as he turns upon them . You come digging in my heart , you make me say things , you cut me in here like a knife  --  To himself . The preacher said you killed Etta  --  Murderer ! Murderer !  --  He says God knows all the blackness in my heart  --  I 'll see about it , I 'll see . " Ye are cursed with a curse " Ah ! Pushing his way through them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't he ? There 's been death all around me  --  Etta , Neill  --  Something 's all mixed up  --  SION continues singing , caught in the spell of the music , his face rapt and lifted towards the sky . GILCHRIST suddenly throws his arms around those nearest him . You are my own people , born with me in these fields , and I feel humbled down before you , you break my heart in two . Yea , the low and the high , the strong and the weak , all are one . I know nothing but that . Lifting up his voice . Where is this God ? Let him speak to me and I would answer him . He knows my heart ! Proud ! I 'm not proud ! He drops on his knees before SION and bends his head to the floor . SION sings on unconscious of him. p. 126 THE OTHERS in a burst of fervor.Glory hallelujah ! He 'll see the light ! God have mercy ! HARDY standing up.Let me alone ! Raising his head . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let it be you and me , man to man . I 'll go talk to you , and you answer me ! He turns quickly and dashes out at the rear . They watch him go wonderingly , and then one by one they raise their illumined faces in song . Are you ready ? Are you ready ? Are you ready for that day to come ? The music swells into a high fervid harmony . In the midst of the singing RHODA bursts in from the room at the left . CAMPBELL screaming at them.You stop that and leave this house ! Where 's Hardy ? You 're trying to kill him . He 's a thousand times better than you all , better than anybody , better than God is . He loves all of you and that 's why you They sing on , paying no attention to her , their faces set in ecstasy . Hardy ! Hardy ! She rushes through the door at the left rear after him . Presently MAG comes in leading her . She goes up to the PREACHER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor sobbing . The music rises triumphant above her and MAG comes softly forward and bends down by her prostrate form . Are you ready ? Are you ready ? Are you ready for the judgment day ? The curtain is lowered and the music dies away . When it comes up again , several hours have elapsed . It is late at night of the same day . A fire is blazing in the fireplace and outside the wind and the rain drive through the trees and against the house in great droning gusts . RHODA sits by the baby 's cradle as before . Now and then as the wind and rain swoop down in sudden violence , she lifts a pale anguished face to listen . Presently MAG comes in from the rear porch carrying an unlighted lamp and a coffee pot . She sets the lamp on the bureau , lights it and begins to heat the pot on a bed of coals at the hearth. p. 127 CAMPBELL Have you heard anything  --  anybody shouting ? MAG No 'm , nothing yit . CAMPBELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind , far-off like . MAG It was them trees out there bending and squeaking . Do n't you worry , he 'll be shore to come in a minute . CAMPBELL Something 's happened to him , something terrible . MAG I 've told you a hundred times , Mis ' Rhody , he 'd come back in a little bit . She puts wood on the fire and sweeps the hearth . CAMPBELL Ah , but the clock 's struck ' leven and he 's not here . MAG Cai n't nothing happen to a big well man like him . CAMPBELL He 's sick . They did it with their preaching . They just about broke his heart and mine too . MAG He 's off hunting the sow that 's found pigs in the pasture , that 's what I bet . CAMPBELL Oh , me ! MAG Have you fed the baby ? CAMPBELL Fed him ? MAG Ah Jacob 'll soon be hyuh and give us news . Mebbe they 're coming back together . p. 128 CAMPBELL If he could a-found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAG I 'll have you some coffee in a bit . It 'll warm you up and make you feel better . CAMPBELL I ca n't drink a drop . MAG But you ai n't et a bite all day . You got to eat , Mis ' Rhody , and git your strength back . CAMPBELL I do n't want my strength back . Oh , I do n't want to live any more , Mag . Ca n't we have any peace ? MAG wiping her eyes with her apron.Now , now , in a week you 'll be up a-singing about the house . You must stop worrying so for the baby 's sake . She sets a chair with hanging clothes to the fire to dry . RHODA rises and makes her way to the window and stands staring out . You 'd better come back to the fire , Mis ' Rhody , you 'll ketch your death o ' cold there . CAMPBELL Listen to that wind and that rain , rain , rain , day and night , day and night . Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feverishly . Get somebody to make it stop , Mag ! I ca n't stand it any more . Crying out . Somebody make it stop pouring down , and Hardy out there lost in it ! She turns and stares abstractedly in the fire as if fascinated with some inner absorption . Her voice rises husky and level . I know now . Hardy 's dead ! p. 129 MAG Nanh  --  nanh  --  he 's as much alive as you or me . CAMPBELL I do n't believe it . I ca n't believe it . I ca n't believe nothing except he 's dead . I 've prayed and prayed to God ; Mag , I prayed all the evening , but God wo n't hear me . Ah , he 's set his curse on us forever . MAG You better go lie back down now . It 'll fair off tomorrow and the sun 'll be out again , and Mr. Hardy 'll be back and all 'll be fine . She starts leading her across the room to the left . Suddenly the raindrops burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sharp gust of wind sucks the flame out of the lamp . CAMPBELL shrieking.Somebody blowed out the lamp ! MAG hurriedly getting a match from the mantelpiece and striking it. It was the wind . It blew suddent under the door there . She lights it again . CAMPBELL shivering and speaking in a throaty whisper.It 's her , Mag . She 's back here . Do n't you reckon so ? MAG starting with terror.Anh ? CAMPBELL She 's never left us , Mag . Pointing to the bedroom at the rear . She stays in there . I hear her at night moving about , slipping around . I know it 's her . She tiptoes across the room to the door at the right rear and tries the knob . I got her locked in , but she can get out , Mag , she comes through the keyhole . She wants to steal the baby , wants to kill him . Do n't you tell Hardy when he comes . He do n't know . I heard the bed-springs pop in there about dark and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her plain . And I run and locked the door tight . Moaning . But she can get out . p. 130 MAG Lord a-mercy ! CAMPBELL And at night I 'd wake up and hear her playing her organ in there and singing . MAG nervously.Come on to bed now . She puts her arm around her and leads her across the room . CAMPBELL You saw her once too , Mag , Jacob said you did . MAG No , no , I did n't . It was more of Jacob 's lies . CAMPBELL drawing back from her bedroom door. I 'm a-scared to go in there . MAG There 's your bed in there . CAMPBELL Hardy 's in there . He 'll hurt me . MAG staring at her. What 's the matter , Mis ' Rhody ? CAMPBELL shaking her head and brushing her hand across her face.I 'm kinder lost or something . Let me lie down now . MAG helps her in to bed , comes out and closes the door . She takes the poker and stirs the fire into crackling flames . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's coming on us . The door at the left rear opens gently and JACOB comes in with a lantern . His old rain-coat and felt hat are streaming with water , and a blast of rainy wind blows in behind him . MAG starts up at the suddenness of his entrance . Jacob , I did n't hear you . p. 131 JACOB softly.I did n't want to skeer her . Where is she ? MAG lowering her voice.Laid down a minute . CAMPBELL inside.Jacob , Jacob ! The door opens and she bursts in . JACOB I was hoping mebbe he 'd come while I was gone . I ai n't found him . CAMPBELL staring before her.He 's in the creek drowned ! MAG coming to her and leading her back into her room.We 'll find him , we will . JACOB Yes 'm , I 'm going to git Sandy and we 'll find him . Do n't you worry . MAG coming out of the room and closing the door.Pore thing ! JACOB Aye , pitiful ! MAG Did n't you see no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the woods , and then I could n't follow him . MAG No telling what 's happened . Why 'd you all come hyuh and try to run him out'n his senses ? JACOB warming himself.The sperit led us and you ought a helped . Laord in heaven , sich a sorrowful house  --  a-ah ! He takes off his coat and sits down. p. 132 MAG I 'm going on home now and I want you to stay . JACOB starting up.Nanh , nanh , I ai n't gon na stay hyuh by myself . MAG They ai n't nothing to hurt you , Jacob . I got to see about Lonie . JACOB This house 's accursed , Mag , you said so . MAG resignedly.Aye , it is , I reckon JACOB If you go and leave , I 'm going too . MAG I ai n't slept in it a night since they was married and I do n't ' spec ' to . When I stayed I sot up . JACOB Aye . MAG I did . JACOB taking up his lantern.I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found . MAG stepping before him.No , you ai n't . You got to stay with me . She makes me skeered saying Mis ' Etta 's in the house . JACOB Hanh ?  --  It 's her being sick so long makes her think it , you reckon ? MAG I reckon . She ai n't well by no means . She had n't ort to be out'n that bed , fer she give birth the hardest I 've ever seed fer a healthy woman . Going over to the crib . And any minute now it 'll die . p. 133 JACOB setting down his lantern.Anh ! You 've been faithful to ' em , Mag . MAG Lord , listen at that wind and rain ! JACOB The whole world 'll be washed away yit . They 'll be a second Noey 's flood . A heavy step sounds on the rear porch . JACOB and MAG stand fearfully away from the left rear door . MAG That 's him , that 's him at last , Jacob ! JACOB I knowed he 'd come . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drenched to the skin , his face haggard . He comes in and sits by the fire without a word . Is that you , Hardy , safe at last ? HARDY softly.Is Rhody asleep ? JACOB Where 've you been ? We 've scoured the country for you . MAG She 's in there . CAMPBELL with a scream of joy within.Hardy ! As he goes into her room , she springs forward to meet him and throws her arms around him sobbing . MAG goes over and closes the door , and RHODA 'S voice comes mumbling and broken from the room. p. 134 JACOB picking up his lantern.Anh , I do n't understand it . MAG Air you going now ? JACOB Adder I walk my legs off  --  a-hunting him , in he comes . He 'd ort to be carried to Raleigh and put in the ' sylum . I 'm going on now .

JACOB I 'm a-going , I tell you . MAG I do n't like  --  She stands a moment undecided . CAMPBELL coming suddenly into the room.Do n't go , Mag , do n't go . Stay with me , you and Jacob ! MAG You 'll be all right now , Mis ' Rhody . He 's back . You and him go to sleep . I 'll come down in the morning , God willing . CAMPBELL beseechingly.No , no , you must n't go , I 'm afraid . MAG I cai n't . I cai n't stay another minute , Mis ' Rhoda . She and JACOB go out quickly. p. 135 CAMPBELL going to the bedroom door. Come on , dry yourself . Fearfully . What you hunting for , Hardy ? HARDY within.I ca n't find it nowhere . There is a sound of closing drawers and GILCHRIST comes into the room . Have you seen it , Etta ? CAMPBELL starting.What you want ? HARDY with a queer smile.I 'd always put it where I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd ask Etta where it was . CAMPBELL throwing her arms around him.Hardy , you 've scared us all to death . I 've cried and prayed for you all the evening . HARDY pushing her from him.Yeh , yeh , sorrow and tears is our lot . He rummages in the drawers of the bureau . RHODA moves unsteadily over to him and clings to him . CAMPBELL Hardy , you 're scaring me again . Come to the fire ; you 're wringing wet . HARDY suddenly shouting out and striking her.Keep your hands away from me , you sinful woman ! She staggers back from him and falls weakly into the rocking chair , staring at him terrified . For a moment he stands gazing back at her and then with a cry he runs to her and buries his face in her lap . No , no , honey , I did n't mean it . I 'm crazy , crazy ! His voice rising high in pain . Why wo n't they let me alone ! He hugs her to him convulsively , his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think of it any more . I 'll take care of you . Stroking his head . Nothing ca n't bother you now . HARDY raising his head.There 's somebody hammering and beating in my head , beating on an anvil with a sledge-hammer . Hitting his breast with his fists . And I 'm stifling in her . Suddenly he stands up and his face hardens into its former cold and haggard look . I hear something like a voice talking to me in a field a thousand miles from here . He moves away from her and begins searching through the drawers , on the mantel , and around the room . CAMPBELL Hardy ! HARDY Somebody 's hid it . CAMPBELL gasping.Come back , come back , you 're sick . HARDY turning quickly towards her.Sick  --  you and me  --  sick unto death and they ai n't enough doctors in the world to cure us . I know it now . CAMPBELL stretching out her hands.Come back to my arms , Hardy . I 'll save you ! HARDY starting back.Look , look , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there 's blood on mine . Blood everywhere . You and me killed her and we killed him . p. 137 CAMPBELL shuddering.Ah . HARDY And blood must pay for blood . He feels in the lower drawer of the bureau and takes out something . You thought I would n't find it , did you ? CAMPBELL staring at him in horror.I did n't know it was there . HARDY I 've got it now . CAMPBELL staggering across the room to the door at the rear and pulling it open.Help , help ! HARDY sitting down by the fire and looking before him.Do n't cry and scream . I 'm not going to hurt you . RHODA creeps back to her chair and sits down , watching him with wide eyes . CAMPBELL Hardy , do n't look like that . What 's happened ? HARDY That 's a good fire there . Dry oak wood burns fine , a red flame in front and a blue one behind  --  hot as hell  --  and red as blood . There 's a plenty of wood under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? CAMPBELL Yes , yes , but it do n't matter now . HARDY A good farmer is always prepared for anything that happens  --  a woodpile full of wood for bad weather and plenty of corn for his stock , ai n't he ? p. 138 CAMPBELL Yes , yes . HARDY bitterly.Is he ? Hanh , no man knows what 's liable to come upon him , no man knows what a fix his mind can get in , does he ? CAMPBELL Maybe not , maybe he ca n't know . But forget it , forget it all . HARDY Nobody but God knows what 's going to happen , and he wo n't tell no man . I went out in the rain there to talk with their God , to match muscle with him  --  to get at the truth . Oh  --  we are blind and scared like chickens before a hawk . A sparrow sets on the ditch bank and a snake raises his head and swallows him , and with my briar-hook I come along and kill that snake . Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I was a snake . That 's what Neill called me  --  called me a snake , a snake in the grass . You heard him that day . CAMPBELL That 's all done been forgot long , long ago , Hardy . Rest your poor mind from it . HARDY It 's fresh with me now same as yesterday . Stretching out his arms . When my grandmammy died it was a cold winter day and I was a little boy no higher'n this chair I 'm setting in . I was out in the yard playing marbles , and before she died I heard a sweet cheeping sound and I looked up and a little bird as white as snow was setting on the comb of the house . And it was singing so pitiful-like it made me want to cry . I run in the house to tell Muh and there they was all sitting around still as death and Grandmuh was stretched out long and stiff under a sheet . There come a whirring sound in the room and that little bird went flying around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke . Then it flew out of the door and across the field . At the burying that day , after they put flowers on the grave , it come up out of the woods and perched itself on the headboard singing its song . When they were n't nobody looking I took my bean-shooter and shot at it and scared it away . They said after it was Grandmuh 's soul . p. 139 CAMPBELL trembling.What is it ? HARDY I saw that little bird again today setting on the fence in the graveyard . But I did n't have my bean-shooter with me , I 'm too old . CAMPBELL Was that where you 've been , Hardy ? HARDY suddenly standing up with a bitter laugh.When you and me die there wo n't be no little snow-white bird singing for us , will there ? There 'll be a buzzard setting on the roof of this house and his 'll be the only mourning . RHODA stares at him in amazement . I 'm going out to the barn now . Yeh , I went out to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! You must n't leave me ! HARDY I wo n't be long . I heard a plank flopping in the wind there and it 's got to be nailed up and the mules ai n't been fed , poor things . As he starts out RHODA springs up and clings to him . He throws her from him into the rocking chair and stands gazing at her cowering in her seat . Look at that hair and eyes and breast I 've felt against my face night after night . I 've drunk ' em down like a man perished and starved for a cool spring and they 've et up my vitals . All the time it was a harlot sucking my soul out'n me maybe so . p. 140 CAMPBELL O God , have mercy upon me ! HARDY Ah , it was . He turns and strides out at the left rear , leaving the door open . The wind and the rain blow in scattering the sparks through the room . RHODA bends over in her chair rocking and moaning with her head in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presently the child emits a thin high wail in its crib , gasps once or twice and is silent . RHODA turns and snatches it frantically up in her arms , walking back and forth across the room , feeling its feet , rubbing its body and crooning over it . After a moment she runs to the door at the rear . CAMPBELL shrieking.Hardy ! Hardy ! She starts to dash out through the door , but a rush of wind and water breaks across her and the baby . Looking down at the bundle in her arms , she wraps it protectingly from the storm and then turns helplessly back into the room . Presently she goes over to MRS . GILCHRIST 'S bedroom door and stands before it cold and straight . And you could get out . You 've had your way and taken him at last . You had no heart . A good woman ! Ah , cold and dark as the grave itself . Death , bloody and cruel death , reaching out and taking life . Now you can rest and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never hurt you . Still you wo n't let us be Jesus ! Jesus ! Sobbing , she lays the baby back in its crib and bows over it in heartbroken grief . And for a long while she bends her head crushed and stupefied . Then she moves uncertainly over before the fire and gradually raises her head and looks before her , her face settling into a cold impassive mask . Take all I 've got then and drive me from the face of the earth . Aunt Etta ! God ! Clenching her fist . And you can kill me , but I hate you for it all . Kill me , crucify me and I 'll not bow my knee now . My tongue will not confess you . GILCHRIST opens the door and comes in . He sits down as before . A gasp breaks from her . Thank the Lord ! p. 141 HARDY I heard a voice calling seemed like . A long ways off . CAMPBELL It was me calling for you . HARDY Aye . He sits staring abstractedly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting.He stuck his nose out of the stall and whickered at me and rubbed my shoulder . Shuddering . And that plank ai n't nailed . Raising his head . I hear it banging . CAMPBELL Yes . HARDY The cow was breathing soft and the pigs grunting and rubbing by the well-post . Shivering . It was all so plain , like I 've heard them all my days . CAMPBELL to herself.And it said woe to them that strive with the maker of heaven and earth . HARDY watching her.Yea , woe ! Woe here and woe hereafter in hell where you and me 'll maybe burn forever and ever . CAMPBELL starting and turning toward him.It must be easier there . HARDY She put a curse on us and we fed our lust on top of her grave . p. 142 CAMPBELL Let God judge . HARDY suddenly striking his breast and crying out in a loud voice.He set his mark on me and branded me and hunted me down like Cain of old . And he branded you along with me and our children would a-been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from the land of Nod . Him there in the crib 'd be if he lives . CAMPBELL Ah  --  God is a sneaking coward , their God ! I hate him ! HARDY No , no ! A just and righteous God , the Lord our God , like he says in the book . I was condemned here in my heart and I know now . Tonight my soul testifies it unto me . CAMPBELL Hurry and kill me then if you believe it . HARDY standing up and staring before him. I was blinded in my own strength . And now I see things clearer . Etta said I would . He sent signs to me and I would n't heed ' em . He sent Etta on the way with me to pray for me and bring me to the fold and I would n't heed him . I kept piling up the goods of this world and bragging in my own might . And then he sent death on her and a curse in her mouth to drive me from my evil ways and still I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is he ! Ah , a thief that kills , that steals the first-born ! p. 143 HARDY sitting down again.Hush , hush . Look how he 's sent his warnings to me . He stayed hid back behind his sky somewhere and let me go on my way . He let me stand up in the morning of life with you and taste of the joys of sin and when I was wropped away in it all he said to hisself , " Now I am the Great I Am and there 's none beside me and I 'll put forth my power and destroy him . " And he sent fire from heaven to fall upon me and a drought to come in the summer and parch up my crops . That preacher he knew it all . The cholera come and killed off my hogs and he cursed the whole neighborhood because of me . And he says I got to answer to him , render up my account . I been out there under that pine where his lightning struck three times . I went and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last he heard me there with the wind and rain blowing . Calmly . He says death . Shouting . Death ! And what was to be will be . The God of these fields , the God of the whole universe says I got to make sacrifice unto Him . Oh , Etta , Etta , hear me , speak to me and tell me you hear me now . CAMPBELL whispering.Their God , not our God . HARDY Yes , the God of all . With a loud drunken-like cry . I hear you  --  yes  --  yes  --  He moves awkwardly across the room'towards the door at the right rear . Come up out of that wide field  --  too far  --  too far away . Whispering . Yes , yes , we are nothing . RHODA pushes herself in front of him . He is everything . Like a breath we are gone . He abideth and remaineth like the hills  --  from generation to generation . Man is a flower soon cut down . p. 144 CAMPBELL She 's gone away from in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . CAMPBELL No , no , not you . HARDY Me , me . It 's got to be paid somehow . Death for death , an eye for an eye  --  CAMPBELL If it 's death , then he 's paid . Look . HARDY clasping his head in his hands and staring at her . I 'm crazy , crazy . I know I 'm crazy , and yet I ca n't seem to stop . Something driving me on . His voice sharp with pain . But he 's beat me down . I 'm tired now and I give in under his hand . Ah , me , I don ' know what to do . CAMPBELL pushing him toward the crib.Look now . It was to be him and not you . GILCHRIST gradually turns and stares down into the crib and then starts forward and puts his hand upon the dead child . He turns and blinks at RHODA uncomprehendingly . HARDY dully.Took him and spared me . CAMPBELL bitterly.The Great I Am that comes in the night ! A righteous God . p. 145 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God and Aunt Etta . HARDY We did n't , did we ? Not you and me ? We did n't kill him too ? CAMPBELL vehemently.She was here in the house and kept me afraid . Deep down I felt her stealing about , her spirit waiting to kill him . HARDY Ha ! She could never forget and never forgive . Fifteen year she said she loved me , and I do n't know . Maybe she hated me . CAMPBELL She did . She loved nobody . HARDY Her God , he done it ? CAMPBELL A God of hate . HARDY as if stung to sudden awareness.The innocent  --  I 'm the guilty . Whining in sudden fury . Who would do that ? Mumbling over and over . The innocent  --  the defenseless . His voice breaking in a bitter laugh . It wa' n't her , it was him behind her , principles , Gods  --  maybe something behind that , the way of things . Bending over the crib . He wants all . Whatever it is , that 'll take all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe us out sweep us away like dust in a wind . The windows rattle in their sockets , and the wind booms around the house . Hah , listen at him there in the night . Beating the back of his hand fiercely in his palm . Same like he was trying to get in here at us  --  that wind is like God after us , like the world turned against us. p. 146 CAMPBELL huskily , as she comes up and stands beside him.And we are not afraid . HARDY monotonously.Not afraid . Angrily . He comes when I 'm gone and takes away my child . CAMPBELL And spares you . HARDY savagely.To make me suffer more . CAMPBELL Let it be , and we can bear it . HARDY Now he 's mashed us down to the bottom . The world wipes its feet on us . There 's nothing else can happen to us , we 're down , down at the bottom now . CAMPBELL weakly.But we can rise again . HARDY repeating childishly.Rise up and fight again . His hand wanders vaguely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist . CAMPBELL catching his arm.We both can . There 's bound to be pleasure , joy somewhere for us . HARDY clutching her to him. Oh , Rhody , a little more  --  a little more . p. 147 CAMPBELL That can be the way  --  you and me in our love  --  together , going together . HARDY hungrily.Yes , yes . CAMPBELL Nothing can touch that  --  our love will remain , you and me together every day , you and me to the end . See all this sorrow , like a purpose to it , and still it did n't touch our love . HARDY tenderly.They ca n't touch that . Nothing ever has and nothing ever will . That 's so , nothing can keep me from loving you . Triumphantly . And nothing can keep you from loving me . Ah , I feel now maybe death could n't . Feverishly . Rhody , Rhody , ' help me now . Let that lead us towards rest , towards peace , peace . CAMPBELL whispering.Peace salvation and mercy in our love . HARDY to himself.God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is stronger than him , than all the world . It comes to me clearer now like a light  --  Wrinkling his forehead. like a great light . CAMPBELL It is . And my love will never die . HARDY Nor mine . It lives . It is life life . Life is  --  you  --  me  --  Lifting up his face . Let the dead pass behind us  --  like a dream and leave us forever . Their way is the way of death . Ours the way of love and that is life . It is , ai n't it , honey ? p. 148 CAMPBELL Yes , yes . HARDY as if seeing a vision.Love and life , love  --  life . It lives beyond death . His face crinkling into a smile . That 's it , that 's it . Life and more abundant life . You are my life , the one I love my wife and I 'm not afraid now with you here . Mumbling . Somehow all I can think of is you here with me now , so close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of hardly . CAMPBELL almost dreamily.And never be afraid , never any more . HARDY Not afraid of God even , their God that sets on his golden throne . No , not that . God , their God  --  They are their god . But he 's outside , up there in the sky  --  Loudly . They put him up there . Striking his heart . In here is where he belongs . Loudly . Rhody , Rhody , up there he is death and destruction , in here he is peace , life . His voice dies out and he stands gazing at her with burning intensity . RHODA leans her head against his breast and they stand locked in each other 's embrace . Presently there is a loud knock on the door at the rear . They pay no attention to it . It sounds again . GILCHRIST calls . Who 's knocking there ? The door opens and the PREACHER comes in dripping wet. p. 149 PREACHER timidly.Brother Hardy , I left ' em praying . I had no come and speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves further into the room . Aunt Margaret 's still praying for ye , and she wo n't sleep till you 're saved and tonight 's the night you must be saved . He stops by the crib , hesitates and looks down . After a moment he draws back in awe . Lord ha ' mercy on these pore children ! He watches them in sorrowful anguish . I 'm sorry , sorry . Mournfully . From them that hath not it shall be taken even that which they hath . HARDY without looking around.Your God giveth and your God taketh away . Go tell Aunt Marg'ret we 're saved . PREACHER Gazing at him hopefully.Blessed be the name of the Lord forever . HARDY Cursed be his name forever . PREACHER Lord ha ' mercy on him ! HARDY Still there 's something never can be taken away . Amen ! PREACHER The blessed light of God 's love . Amen . HARDY The light of our love . p. 150 CAMPBELL Yes , yes . HARDY The light of life . Not the light up there , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that shall burn forever . HARDY The light here in my breast and in your breast . The light of human beings that lighteth every man into this world . His face broken with a queer grieving happiness . And it will give us strength to go forth again in the morning . Now again I 'm strong and will be to the end . I was dreaming and now I am awake . The PREACHER states at him in perplexity . Now again we 'll go into the fields and sow and reap and bring forth the fruits of life . CAMPBELL Me with you . HARDY And me with you  --  both together . For the joy that 's in us . His voice rising fresh and triumphant . And we 'll raise up sons and daughters unto  --  onto  --  the light  --  our God . Yea , and I 'll go into the church and call my people and tell them the way of our salvation , the way of truth , the way of  --  of  --  our God . StammeringThe God  --  the God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The PREACHER watches them in amazement . GILCHRIST waves his hand at him . Go and leave us alone , now we are saved and you can stop your prayers ! Loudly . Leave us ! The PREACHER backs away from them in distress and goes wonderingly out at the rear . GILCHRIST falls on his knees and embraces RHODA . We are God  --  Man is God . That 's the light , that 's the truth . It will set them free . And love shall abide among us to the end . He kisses the hem of RHODA 'S skirt , his face touched again with a queer and indefinable sadness. p. 151 CAMPBELL her face shining through her tears .                                                                   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
