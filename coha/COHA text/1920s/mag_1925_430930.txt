 | AN ENGINEER TALKS ON MEDICINE I EVEN a casual survey of the broad field of healing will turn up the most divergent doctrines as to disease , cure , and health . They divide practitioners into schools , mutually exclusive , more or less competitive , about as receptive each of another 's philosophy as rival political parties . In fact , the more powerful of them have their political aspects quite as marked as their scientific . In discussing the subject almost everybody , professional as well as lay , stresses what he or she believes , ' or what his or her view ' happens to be . Medical wisdom has a nebulous fringe . Now is that not a hard pass for the layman ? Charged with preserving whatever he may have of health and perhaps improving it , he is faced sooner or later with the practical task of deciding what advice and assistance to select . How is he to choose ? A bashful swain in a bevy of girls has no more difficult or delicate selection to make , nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way . Few indeed have been the professors of medicine who have suggested at all audibly that there may be understandable laws at the bottom of the science , as there are laws underlying most fields of exact knowledge . It is not that medicine has lacked a most fascinating publicity . On the contrary , it occupies a generous share of type space ; but the conclusion most readily drawn from the public print would be that , rather than any laws of general application , there are separate laws for separate ailments , or at any rate for separate groups of diseases , and that successful practice is too mystical , too involved , too confused and technical for a mere layman to grasp . People thus dazzled find interesting and ingenious ways of avoiding the need of thought and yet making a choice that they can accept . Some gravitate to the most prominent physician in town , gauging therapeutic success by size of practice and invoicingability . Business men of ample spoils . deeming themselves good buyers , want their doctors in Packards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , ' fasten themselves to it offensively and defensively , much as they would join a church , and patronize those physicians who profess the chosen articles of faith . They pl- the emphasis less on circumstance an yore on denomination . A taste for precision inclines some people of means to specialists . If by precedent or by comparing notes with neighbors they persuade themselves to a fair certainty what part of their being is at the time deranged , they may take upon themselves the responsibility of selecting which specialist to consult . On the other hand , if discretion is held above courage they may employ the family physician to make the preliminary survey and to guess more expertly to what address they should be referred , saving in that way unnecessary examinations  | of parts not rightfully under suspicion . To choose with thought , however , and even to discover simple principles in medicine , is not unreasonably hard for the layman if he discounts at the outset the uncomfortable feeling that he may be in that respect odd and lonely . Going candidly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will find all thought and action in the practice of healing divided into two great parts . One embraces the vast majority of the profession and the laity , and devotes itself to isolated diseases ; the other embraces but a very few , and deals with disease-tendencies and constitutional remedy . On one side he has found all the confusion , and on the other a few simple principles he can really understand . This division occurred about one hundred years ago , as a result of Hahnemann 's work . He had based all of his conclusions on experiment , thorough and systematic , covering an arduous lifetime , working along independent lines and carrying them to their end . He more than anyone else had deduced laws . He was therefore reviled by the established profession . His work was distorted and misunderstood even by well-meaning would-be disciples . What characterizes this odd philosophy ? In what principal ways does it depart from usual traditional or common thought ? In the first place , Homoeopathy has a different objective . It is quite satisfactory to almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailment to disappear . Any means may be justified that has that result . A cancer may be carved off . After that , whatever there may be for the patient to complain of , certainly he no longer suffers from cancer , for there is no cancer . Suppose the cancer occurs at some point ? say on an important internal organ ? where it can not be cut off , because that would kill or seriously injure the patient . Two other courses are still open : a delicate operation to remove the organ , eliminate the cancer , and replace the organ with all necessary connections , ? perhaps to substitute a fresh part from another individual , ? or a cancer-destroying agent applied at the spot . New agents are discovered every few months . X-ray , ultra-violet light , and radium have been numbered among them . And related to these in purpose , but different in technique , are the many attempts to isolate a serum or virus such that , when properly injected into the blood , it will terminate the bacterial action that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , and amazing laboratory methods are devoted to the quest for still other and better ways of attacking ' this one disease . All this is based on the idea that cancer is a local affection and that , aside from the cancer itself , all the remainder of the patient is well . Whatever the disease , the usual examination goes no further than that ; it stops at the boundary of the affected parts and includes nothing that went before . Consider the matter from th other end . People confess that they a ck . If you sit down with one of them and make note of everything , he tells you , you will cover page after page with notes and by looking into his face you will see that he is sick . He may drift from one doctor to another , be examined from top to toe , and every examination and every test may turn out negative , and in that case he would be pronounced sound . Allow him to go unaided , even though he recover some of his lost powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any doctor would recognize it finally . When in later years such a person shows cancer  | of some sort , tuberculosis , fatty degeneration of the liver , some form of Bright 's disease , or whatever it may be , can we excuse the physician who said in the first instance that he was not sick ? The doctor was blind to everything that was not ponderable , that he could not sense with his own eye , and he passed over the sensations that the patient wanted to tell him about . He considered only a part of his case . Again , if the case is presented after the disease has run to ultimation in morbid tissue , and the doctor can see by his own independent senses that something is wrong , he then gathers only an unimportant part of the facts if he neglects what went on before ? precisely the kind of things , the very manner of suffering , that would have been his surest guide to treatment years before , had he known how to make use of it . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . These elaborate institutions for cancer research are beside the mark . What they ought to be studying is not cancer , but patients who have cancer , together with patients who are going to have cancer if they are not cured now . It is characteristic of Homoeopathy that disease-tendencies are divined and treated rather than diseases themselves . The significance of ailments is in relation to the tendencies that they betray . If the specific maladies are attacked separately the patient is not improved , ? he may easily be made seriously worse , ? even though the troubles that describe the disease are terminated . It is invariably true that when some deep-seated pathology is presented , such as a case of cancer , the patient 's peculiarities that went before were less serious and easier to treat . Attacking a specific symptom or special disease separately , aiming to eradicate it without reference to the patient as a whole , results in one of two ways . First and least harmful is palliation . A sore throat is palliated by a hot pack . A headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such devices establish no reason why the pain should not return . The patient is eased . but not cured . Now the second is a more dangerous way of getting rid of symptoms ? suppression . Surgical removal of the cancer is a case in point . Driving away eczema by external lotions is another . Suppression closes off the avenue of discharge taken by the disorder . If the eruption is regarded as the entity to be treated in eczema , and if it is suppressed from outside , it may never return as eczema , but sooner or later it will return ? very likely as Bright 's disease . Much modern therapy takes this blundering course , driving the patient from a comparatively light malady to a deeper and more difficult one , and we wonder why it is that , along with the increasing power of modern specifics , there is also an increase in the deepest disorders of body and brain , which end in death or public asylum . We wonder at the frequent stories in the paper telling of the sudden ending of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown , a sudden , complicated dissolution , somewhere between fifty-five and sixty-five yearn of age ; and the answer almost always is local suppression , cumulative through life , and practised by the choice of the profession . This is not altogether to be laid at the physician 's door . We get in doctors ' services , as in other services , about what we demand , and so we pay for our thoughtlessness . II Though almost any physician is quite content with any means that will rid the patient of disease symptoms ,  | Homceopathy , as I have suggested , knows three ways in which that can be done : palliation , suppression , ? one futile and the other desperately harmful , ? and cure . What is cure ? Cure rids the patient not only of his disease symptoms but also of his disease-tendencies ; renders him less likely to be sick ; places him at a higher level of health than he has known before . To cure in this sense is the full mission of the doctor . How then is cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symptoms ? Cure follows out a definite law . This law , like Newton 's law of motion , is commonly stated in two parts , though it is one law . First , cure proceeds from within outward . Complaints of the heart and chest and head must in recovery be accompanied by manifestations upon the surface , in the extremities , upon the skin , nails , and hair . Hence you will find that these parts become diseased when patients are getting well . . . . In cases of rheumatism of the heart you find , if the patient is recovering , that his knees become rheumatic ; and he may say , " Doctor , I could walk all over this house when you first came to me , but now I can not walk , my joints are so swollen . " That means recovery . ' Thus the late Doctor Kent of Chicago to his pupils twenty-five years ago . Cure proceeds from more important to less important parts of the economy , and thence permanently away . Secondly , cure retraces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of middle age was about to go to the operating-table in a famed Eastern hospital , near death from cancer . Surgeons prescribed operation , but said at the same time that she could not survive the shock . It happened that a sister knew of a true Homceopathist and determined to try him . He examined into the history of the case , as well as into the cancer , and found out what had gone before . She had suffered agonies of another sort months earlier , had been treated locally , and supposed she had been cured . This former malady was brought back to her and it in turn cured , and she lived to advanced age in good health and activity . Homoeopathy stands alone in medicine in results aimed at , in facts taken account of when examining a case , in conception , and in method . It stands alone also in that there are laws ? definite , simple , understandable ? that always apply and always , when applied , work . But someone says : You have n't been describing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infinitesimal dose . ' The handling of infinitesimals is part of Homeopathy . So also is the law of similars , from which it gets its name . But these belong to the therapeutics , while we are talking of the philosophy . When you know the laws you can employ potentized remedies . If you do not know the laws , potentized remedies mean nothing to you and you can accomplish next to nothing with them . Potentizing empowers medicines . That is a matter of experiment . When you have found the basis of a prescription according to the laws , remedies potentized and used in the right potency do the quickest and most , permanent work . Notice , if you will , how much more comprehensive is the study of the case in Homceopathy ; and yet there is no such thing as diagnosis . The peculiarities of the patient that guide to the remedy are not those that identify the disease . The patient is considered as a whole , and treated not on the diagnostic manifestations , but on the totality of symptoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those belonging to the specific disease , 346 AN ENGINEER TALKS ON MEDICINE  | ? if there is a specific disease , ? have disappeared from within outward and in the inverse order of their coming , then there has been a cure . So much for theory . The fact is that this philosophy has penetrated traditional medicine not at all . It could not penetrate . It would have to upset , wreck , demolish . Too many physicians are dogmatists , and too many laymen like that sort of physician . The traditionalists , called regulars , meet in convention , compare notes , relate their experiences , recount their laboratory discoveries , air their differences , and settle by consensus of opinion what shall be the approved practice . The following year , their experience having changed , they vote out the old practice and vote in a new one . Every disease is a separate problem . New diseases have a special fascination . New diseases , like influenza , catch them unprepared . They have little to offer to those armies of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Traditional medicine is no nearer to law now than it was two centuries ago , though its practice has been shifting . III When Homoeopathy came into the field traditional medicine was in a bad way . It used drugs in big doses . They were ill fitted to the maladies at which they were aimed . They brought on gross overeffects , and drug afflictions became as common and as dangerous as the more natural sicknesses . Public and profession were deserting the faith and casting about for something better . The thought was growing that , as Doctor Holmes later expressed it , the world would have been the gainer if all the drugs that people had consumed had been sunk in the sea . Homoeopathy seemed to offer a way to use drugs in very small doses and thus encourage the old school to abandon their gross drugging . This influence , superficial as it was , was still under way when the work of Pasteur came on the field . Here , it seemed . would be a possible escape from drugs altogether , by substituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them . In the temper of medicine at that time , this was  --  ; zed upon and elaborated as no other innovation has ever been seized by the established school . It was confidently expected to furnish a specific for each and every human ailment , and to establish the origin of each at some point outside the human economy , where it could be located , attacked , and routed . Entrenched practice had laughed at infinitesimals , but here was an opportunity to reach infinitesimals by making them seen , by bringing them to light . This was real progress . Besides , were not preparations similar in nature to the infecting agents to be used as cures , and would that not embrace all there could be in the law of similars ? Not all the influence of these two major developments was felt inside the traditionalist camp . Going a bit further than old-school men , but still failing to comprehend the philosophy , a new school grew up , called by the name Homoeopathy . ' These men made some study of Hahnemann 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and got some characteristic successes in that way ; but in desperate circumstances they resorted to the same palliatives , stimulants , and suppressives that characterized the older school . They thus took up in a limited way with some of the practices , but did not absorb the reasons . They were superficial , and presented a wavering front . With the advent of bacteriology as a factor in old-school practice , bearing a CINE FEAR 347  | ghastly resemblance to Homoeopathy , but dealing nevertheless with diseases and not with patients , it is little wonder that these half-breed Homceopathists were disconcerted . They were on no tirmer ground scientifically than their elder brothers . They were no less exponents of empiricism . Most of their thunder had been stolen . They flocked to serum therapy with quite as much zest as anybody . They lost their distinction as to method , and had never had any as to principle . Out of the jumble there could be ultimately no , ther issue than submergence . So one hears everywhere that Homce , pathy is a dead issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name have closed or have been handed over to the dominant practice . Scarcely a single medical college of first rank that was teaching at the opening of this century what passed generally as Homoeopathy has survived . The once powerful flourishing American Institute has fear and confesses it . Once reared as a menace to the entrenched medicine of its day , once the butt of the medical jibe and the victim of professional slight , scorn , persecution , this ill-founded mongrel empiricism is now passing out of sight by a process like that which one of our Presidents described as benevolent assimilation . ' Thus draws to a close an important epoch in the history of medicine . If the dominant school swells with pride in a well-earned victory , it is entitled to do it . But the blessing of it is that the air is becoming clearer . One confusion is blending itself with another , naturally enough , and it leaves standing in a less beclouded light the simple truths that are the laws of medicine . Homoeopathy itself is being rid of travesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down , but has come to the morning of a new day .
