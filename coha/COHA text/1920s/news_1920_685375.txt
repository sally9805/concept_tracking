txt There arc two subjects in the world on which reliable news is not readily obtainable . One is Russia and the other is Mexico . In both there is now what our new Secretary of State describes as " a commotion " . Of course , the . Washington Administration can not see anything in Mexico ortRus.sia except natural agitation and commotion of people struggling for light and liberty . If the American Revolution marked a progress in the world 's development what ought to he the greater progress of Mexico when Preident Wilson is willing to declare that Mexico is just struggling as did our forefathers and is entitled to all the benefits of the struggle ? History records 73 revolutions  --  not " commotions " ? in Nlerico in the past 100 years . As Diaz kept peace in the country for WY years , the record outside of his administration averages a fraction better than one revolution a year . A traveler just returned from Mexico says : " It is very difficult to get the real situation in Mexico City or anywhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling into the country to find that I was more behind schedule time in going from New York to the Rio Grande on the American railways than , I was in-traveling through Mexico to the City of Mexico . But then in Mexico trains do not run at night and their schedule is for slow travel by day-time with 25 armed guards sitting on top of the cars . " No sooner had I reached Mexico City than there was not only revolution but an earthonake and although Carranza had cut down some of the beautiful trees to protect his palace . there was , no other sign of " commotion " in the capital and Mexico City seemed to me one of the most beautiful cities in the world with her noble park and ' trees and beautiful buildings , well-kept , stately and grand . " I found that everybody was against ' his whiskers ' as they called Carranza . Slut who was on top or what was to be the government , r.obody seemed to know ; but , of more importance , nobody seemed to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business . The country is doing business on a. gold basis and you are about as well served as in New York . " The trouble with the Mexican people is that they are not serious . Everything with them is a joke . The revolution is a joke . Even life itself is a joke . If Carranza got away with the coined gold of the Treasury , it was a joke . " ? Another party returned from Mexico says : " If there could he international law , or proof under which the ousted party of the Latin-American republics could be recovered from after escaping to Europe , it would go a long way to stop the revolutions in the countries south of us . " When one party gets out , it he escapes with his life , he usually escapes with the Treasury . There are no certafied public accountar.ts in the country to prove whence came the personal fortune which later turns up in Europe . " Further investigation shows that Pelaez is now the military governor of Tampico and the oil district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and - united for a constructive government . How long they will remain united and whether they will do the proper thing and abolish the I. W. W. constitution of Carranza and restore constitutional government for the cause of which Carranza claimed to have made the revolution , can , not now be stated . But there is a little war cloud coming down from the north in the form of an I. W. W. party or army that is the radical wing in Mexico and may yet have to be dealt with . But at present the conservative forces of the country are in control . The army of Pelaez which has held and protected the oil fields for so many years represented the owners and workers of the soil the same as did the army of Zapata , which has held for so many years the region to the south and so close to Mexico City . The army of Zapata was an army of honest soldiery defending their own homes and lands . They were the only people *hat in possession of the city of Mexico refused to loot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however that Zapata is dead and " people in this country have photographs of his dead body . Pelaez was not only the defender of the oil fields aga4 , -t Ce-rraTIZa , but it is now known that it was the Carra.nia troops that did whatever damage there was in the oil fields such as the cutting of pipelines and the burning of bridges . Much has been said about the taxes paid by the oil companies to Pelaez . As a matter of fact , the contribution of all the oil companies did not amount to more than . $304100 a month in gold . With this money , Pelaez paid his soldiers . put down banditry , made the country reasonably wafer and protected it against Carranza and his minions . It is to Pelaez that the United States owes not only the protection of the American-owned oil fields in Mexico , but the protection of oil there which enabled the Allies to win the war . While Carranza was with the Germans , Pelaez was against the Huns and during the European - war , no one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to the position of Ohregon , it is now said that while up ' to 19l8 he was like mast Mexican generals against . Uncle Sam and threatening the big brother to the north with extinction , he opened his eyes in lO1.8 when he came to the United States and-made a trip through the country . He found there was no amibition in the United States.to posseas Mexico or make trouble for her people and he became ambitious to have some of the prosperity of the North transferred to the South . His conversation reminded one of that Douthern general who , after the Civil War , visited the cities of the North and exclaimed : " Why , in thunder , did we erer go to war against the wealth and power of the northern states and wiry . in thunder , did n't you lick us quicker and end the war sooner ? " Obregon has been the one-armed hero of Mexico . Ile outageneraled Villa , scattered his army and then settled down in Sinaloa as a ccrmrniasion merchant and made a fortune of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest market for their consumption . Obregon is now a business man that . knows iho value of capital , prosperity and American credit .
