txt It was Coolidge . Coolidge all the way in the opening session of the Republican National Convention this morning . The keynote speech by Representative Theodore E. Burton of Cleveland centred around a panegyric of the President and a denunciation of his enemies , especially those of his own household , which was echoed with terrific enthusiasm by the galleries and with moderate enthusiasm by the delegates . The attendance was one of the scantiest seen at the opening of a national convention in modern times ; the keynote speech was addressed to some 8,000 spectators and 4,000 empty seats , and this despite the fact that several hundred persons who had no tickets has " crashed tile gate . " But such crowd as it was was all for Coolidge and all against his enemies . A visitor from Mars getting his only impression of contemporary American politics from Mr. Burton 's speech wouliil have gathered that the enemies of the Lord were the Republican Congressional leaders in the first place . La Follette and the nominally Republican radicals in the second place , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , too . It rose up and roared approval when Mr. Burton said of the President : " In the midst of temptations stronger I than those by which the angels fell he has gone calmly and steadily on his way , unaffected by the lure of expediency or the promise of success . " If howled and cheered when he denounced third party movements , and said that " the word Republican is not a cloak for individual vagaries , " and men stood up in the galleries shouting " Put Wisconsin out . " It howled approval again when he demanded " a Republican majority in the next Congress made up of members tried and true , who will stand united . " Men stood up in the galleries then shouting , " Down with Lodge ! " " Put Lodge out ! " They waited till the tumult had died down to shout again , " Put Lodge out , " when comparative silence gave them a better chance to be heard . Congressmen Conceal Emotions . The speakers from the platform , equipped - with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the enthusiasts upstairs who took their chance to shout " Put Lodge out " ? Lodge who dominated the Republican Convention of four years ago , in every respect except the nomination of Calvin Coolidge . The delegates , of course , had to stand up when the crowd stood up . Some of them cheered when the crowd cheered . and others - went through the motions of cheering . But when Mr. Burton said that most people " look to President Coolidge rather than to Congress for leadership , " and the audience ratified his assertion with roaring cheers , fully half of the delegates who are going to have to vote for the renomination of Coolidge on Thursday stood up in silence , with sickly smirks on their faces . Henry Cabot Lodge stood up . too , and smiled , with a fair approximation to his usual self-possession . But if Mr. Burton 's tribute to the President provoked more than one-half of 1 per cent . of tht ? enthusiasm among the great bulk of the delegates , that they provoked in the gallery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delcgates , however , had already had their own chanoe to cheer . When Mr. Burton had discussed corruption in the Government and the Senatorial in ' vestigations. just before coming to his treatment of the President 's own record , he had said that " there is no criminal whom any investigation could expose who is more false to decency and honor than the man who would besmirch the name of honest citizens or distort the truth for partisan advantage or personal exploitation . " the delegates found a sentiment of which they could and did approve vociferously . And a. moment later , when he said that " those who seek to bring malign inMerle-on public servants make no political distinction either in the officials whom they approach or the lawyers whom they hire . " with obvious reference to William G. this somewhat dolorous convention emitted its first and last ripple of laug , iter . In his discusteon of the Winter 's scan dals in Washington Mr. Burton took the position already familiar from the expressmns or President Coolidge . Here , too , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of all these rumors of iniquity is to punish the guilty , but at the same time condemn exaggeration and protect the innocent . It is an infamous crime to destroy the confidence of the American people in the Government under which they live . " And , after denunciation of " indiscriminate scandal-mongering. he added : " This is no reflection upon any investigator who in good faith is seeking to expose crime or any other dereliction among public servants . The guilty individual , whether he be high or low . Democrat or Republican , must suffer the severest punishment . Upon this proposition the Republican party stands firm as a rock . " One man shared the honors of the day with the absent President . After the keynote speech was over , when the necessary formalities of organization were being finished off as fast as possible and the spectators were already beginning to troop out for a long overdue lunch , Mr. Burton announced , after the formal adoption of motions for the appointment of various other committees , that " the chair recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of making a motion to " appoint the Resolutions Committee . " Then everybody stood up and cheered again ? s. demonstration which to all appearances was spontaneous and which was as prolonged and uproarious as mealy spontaneous demonstrations are , as the Secretary of the Treasury came forward and went up through the little trapdoor to the speakers ' platform . He made no effort to make the crowd hear him , but turned over his formal motion to a reading clerk , who produced it in a fine lyric tenor . But the crowd had had a chance to see Mr. Mellon out in the open and it gave him a tremendous ovation , which showed that among the spectators of this convention , at least , Mr. Mellon is as popular as the Congressional leaders are not . It was all a Coolidge keynote . In the various issues on which the President has clashed with his own party leaders in Congress Mr. Burton spoke out for the President 's side of the question without compromise . Though praising the revenue bill just passed , he admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of his speech to an appeal for the reduction of high surtaxes as provided in the Mellon plan , though that specific scheme for tax revision was not mentioned . When he came to immigration he said that " it is to be regretted that the request of the President for time for further negotiation with Japan was refused . " He treated the bonus and the President 's veto as a closed issue , which is now law and " must be willingly accepted . " Paint Praise for the League . And when he came to the World Court , which , he observed , was not only essentially an American idea but a Republican ices , he ignored all the various Senatorial proposals and demanded flat adherence to the Harding-Hughes-Coolidge positioh . " It is not for us , " he said , " to assert that the League is a wicked institution . and in any case the provisions set forth in the protocol for the Court itself remove it from any domination on , the part of that body . " g As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one who had originally favored going into it with reservations , he said that he could discuss it dispassionately , and add most of what he regarded as its shortcomings to the association of the League Covenant with the Treaty of Versailles . ? " We welcome whatever of good . may be accomplished by the League , ' he saig , " and we recognize that in humanitarian and non-political matters it has accomplished beneficent results . In some of these activities we have taken part and will no doubt in the future . But this does not mean that we should assume membership . So long as the League remains a political body , inevitably dominated by the larger nations of Europe , poisoned with the tradition of age-long animosities , membership is not for us . ' Mention of President Harding . whose large , flag-draped portrait hung behind the stage , was , of course , much less copious , and in one instance at least was downright apologetic . In speaking of the death of Mr. Harding , " whose untiring labors made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sad as that of the soldier who perishes with all his armor on , " Mr. Burton took occasion to add : " If ever he made those mistakes which mortals must make , it was because of the kindness of his heart , because of a noble mind which thought do ill of friend or foe , but reposed trust in every one . " Mr. Burton spoke for an hour and a half , and until he came to the topic of the President 's personal record it would be inaccurate to report that he caused much excitement . He went into two questions  --  scientific tax revision and relief for the farmers ? at considerable length , and a great part of his speech sounded very much like a lecture on the fundamentals of economics delivered to a bored and somnolent college audience . ' Part of this effect , to be sure , may have been due to the multiplication of devices w.ach now permit a keynote speech to be heard by means of radio all over the country , but unfortunately bring incidental injury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed . For directly in front of the speakers ' stand are the microphones which must catch the-speakers ' words for the amplifiers , which carry them all over the hall , and the radio which sends them all over the country . Unless he talks directly into the amplifiers he is apt to be heard indistinctly or not at all . So Mr. Burton had to spend most of his hour and a half leaning on his elbows over the speakers ' desk , a tall , stoop-shouldered speaker , reading his speech with shell-rimmed glasses from small sheets of typewritten paper . In this part of his address he rarely raised his voice or wandered far from the stand : When he did become sufficiently interested about something to ( speak with more vigor and turn to address himself to different parts of the audience , he was apt to miss the micro , phones , so that , on the whole , he was least audible when he spoke most loudly . But the effect of this part of the speech depended , of course , very largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today was interested in nothing but the merits of Calvin Coolidge and , to a mild degree , in prohible tion . A demand for " law enforcement , " interpreted , of course , as meaning enforcement of the Volstead act , brought some applause , and there was actual cheering for the first time when he said that " hasty changes in existing laws or regulations can not he approved ; if that were the case , all our policies would be like the shifting sands of the sea , which ace scattered by wind and wave . " By no means everybody in the galleries applauded this , and a still smaller percentage of delegates , but those who did applaud were so vigorous about It that they sounded like a mob . Seats Were One-Third Brapti . Mr. Burton is probably the best-known citizen of Cleveland , outside of THE ; Speaker and elyron T. Herrick. but he would have made no great commotion in his home town today without Calvin Coolidge as a theme . This opening session apparently created little excitement in Cleveland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal convention hall , as much better than Chicaga 's much-used and more abused Coliseum as the Coliseum , is better than a vacant lot . as Cleveland has never , had a. carmen ? tion before , it had been supposed that at the first session at least a city of nearly a million people would have no trouble in filling an auditorium which , outside of delegates and convention staff , seats only about 12,000 . When the convention opened with the spectators ' seats a third empty , a good many people supposed that this mishap was due only to the unprecedented occurrence of opening on time . By a 1:30 it might have been supposed everLtaody would be on hand . But when the keynote speech , the only real business of the day , began at 11:30 , half an hour after the convention had started . there were hardly more people in the hall than there had been when Sousa and his band I ceened the proceedings with the " Star Spangled Banner . " Cleveland comes on time if it comes at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the convention hall , they came to the numbar of only a few hundred , and these were finally allowed to pass in . ' Yet , as shows go , it ought to have been satisfactory . A hall in which everybody can not only have a comfortable seat , but can hear and see . is not always found in convention cities ; Cleveland is in perhaps better luck than it knows . Before the proceedings began the crowd was entertained by the play of the trick lights of this highly modern auditorium  --  a sudden switching off of the ordinary illumination which left the stage brightly lighted and the rest of the hall in dusk , then the switching on of red and purple lights under the ceiling skylights , to make the Scotch plaid effect of which Cleveland is just y proud . though somewhat illogically in a city which is so largely Slavic and Magyar . The only decorations in the hall were flag-draped portraits of Presidents Lincoln , Roosevelt and Harding behind the stage  --  Harding in the centre and larger than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the session a large flag was let down from the flies and covered the three portraits until the business of the day began . Face Both Ways for Picture . At the very beginning of the session occurred an episode which . in view of the later demonstration by Republicans of hostility to Republican leaders , seemed ominously symbolic . John T. Adams , soon to retire as Chairman of the National Committee , announced that elle flashlight picture of the convention would be taken and asked that the delegates be seated and turn toward the rear of the hall . With proper docility the ' deleeates got themselves seated and then discovered that their seats were so close together that they could n't turn toward the rear of the hall . Some of them followed orders and stayed seated , thus getting only the backs of their heads in the picture , and some of them followed inclination and stood up to get their faces on record . Then , as later , the Republicans were facing both ways . Mr. Adams seized his last chance to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own misdeeds , as contrasted with America , " alone among the nations of the world united , stable , happy , prosperous and free . " But after all there was business to be done , and he got it done very promptly and gave Cleveland a chance to rise up and cheer one of its own favorite sons . Mr. Burton repaid the crowd for his welcome by devoting his opening efforts to flattering remarks about the city and the State . " I greet this vast throng , " he began , " gallery above gallery . " There was in fact only one gallery , and that was half empty , but after all a man may be excused a little exaggeration in his home town . He assured the delegates that Cleveland was glad to see them , and then had to go on to an apologetic explanation that the downtown parts of the city , which are all that most delegates have seen , are not the show places of Cleveland . " We are in the midst of the bustle and smoke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial community , but the pure air of heaven is ? around and above us. and a friendly spirit is everywhere . " His speech began , naturally , with a tribute to the various Ohio Presidents , which was received in silence except when he referred to another Clevelander , James A. Garfield , who drew the tribute of a Shakespeare quotation from Mr. Burton and some mild applause from the crowd . There was some more applause for his tribute to the ladies , whom he assured that " the finer grades , the keen discrimination of women are needed in the body politic . " But there was little to get eecitecl about in his prolonged review of the achievements of the Republican Administration , frequently interlarded with such words as " it is to be regretted . " " perhaps this was mot wholly satisfactory , " and so on . Discusses Nation 's Economics . Nor was there room for popular enthusiasm , though much for the approval of conservative economists , in his long analysis of the bases of agrarian prosperity . Diversification of crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ills of the farmers . " Any artificial stimulus to prices , which are depressed by irresistible causes can only postpone the evil day and add to the distress . " Quite as searching , but somewhat more congenial to the temper of the crowd was his discussion of the need for economy of expenditure and accompanying tax reduction . " The recent revenue law is not the last word , " he said . " To secure these most desirable objects of economy an active campaign of education must he conducted similar to that in the free silver contest of 1896 . " The applause that greeted this was a ' foreshadowing of the enthusiasm later to be shown for the appearance of Mr. Mellon , who has been conducting a campaign of education , so far unsuccessful , among members of his own party . More applause for the declaration that in dealing with natural resources " no hundred-year franchises should be given , " obviously aimed at Henry Ford and Muscle Shoals ; no applause at all for a hastily split-over remark about conservation of oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration that toward the desirable end of relieving the President from unnecessary burdens " there could be no more practical step than to diminish the demands upon his time for the settlement of questions of patronage . " But the whole house cheered when Mr. Burton , after deploring the occasional evidences of moral decay , solemnly asserted that " the heart of the American people is sound . " Yet on the whole , it would have been a dull speech and dully received but for the chapters dealing with the personality and record of President Coolidge . On that theme Mr. Burton dropped once more Into poetry , the higher form of expression reserved in this speech to Cleveland be- a Clevelander , for the actual President and Garfield the home town boy . Henry Cabot Lodge . the greatest mioter of poetry among contemporary American orators , who buried the Washington conference two years ago under an avalanche of Byron and Browning , sat listening while the amateur Berton quoted poetry and the galleries shouted : " Put Lodge out . " Perhaps he was thinking four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
