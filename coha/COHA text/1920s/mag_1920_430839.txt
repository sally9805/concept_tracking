 | A THOUSAND miles westward from the coast of China the Yangtze River , which in Chinese means " The Child of the Ocean , " in its passage through the outer rim of central Asia 's mountain system has carved , in surpassing beauty and majestic grandeur , the five gorges of the upper Yangtze , rightly called the gateways to West China . They stretch from Ichang , until recently the head of steam navigation , to Kweichow , a distance of I2j miles . The traveler is prompted to call " Hats off ! " as he sails between these massive walls , crowned with cathedral domes that companion with the clouds , and his ad- miration is mingled with awe of the river , with its succession of rapids and treacherous whirlpools that take heavy toll of life and merchandise from those who enter , thus creating the tradition that only the hardy and the favored of the gods pass through . Such is the entrance to the country which the first Western traveler , Marco Polo , who visited that country in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , and a recent visitor calls " Sze-chuan the Beautiful , the richest and most populous and altogether the most picturesque part of China . "  | For many centuries and until yesterday , the journey from Ichang to Chung-king. a distance of 50o miles , required fully a month and sometimes two . It was made by native junk , pulled along after the manner of the old-fashioned canal-boat , but , instead of the tow-path mule , by a crew of twenty to sixty men tugging at the shore end of a bamboo hawser sometimes fully one-half mile in length . The task of these trackers is most arduous and beset with constant danger . Sometimes they are seen scrambling over rocks and boulders upon which it would seem impossible for men to travel : next we see them clinging to the sides of precipitous cliffs , where a slip costs a limb or a life : and again set on all fours , gripping fast to rock or shore , while the crew aboard the boat pries it obliquely into and up the stream by the bow-sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lash of the fu-teo to gain headway as the boat is released and swings shoreward . Today , dynamite is blasting a safer course , and fourteen-knot steamers make the journey in forty steaming hours . The devils of the waters , as these rivermen will believe , have won their victories also , for a large German commercial steamer lies buried in 120 feet of water at the entrance to one of the gorges . Tomorrow it will be the railway , for it is now known that Sze-chuan holds a golden store for the first road that enters  | it . The French have long planned to extend their Tongking-Yunnan line northwest to Chung-king and Cheng-tu . The Belgian syndicate has contracted for a line southwest from Singan to Cheng-tu , which will connect the province with the railway systems of northeast China and Manchuria ; and the Four-nation HuKwang agreement , in which America has a share , calls for a line from Hankow to Cheng-tu . A company of American engineers has completed the survey of this last named line and a start has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supper in Ichang , breakfast in Chungking , and tiffin in Cheng-tu . THE SPIRIT OE THE ORIENT DEPARTS WHEN THE LOCOMOTIVE ENTERS Time , which in the West is born with wings and flies , but in China stands footless , content to crawl , will be saved , and the Sze-chuan Alps will vie with those of Furope as the Mecca of travelers . But with the gain will come the loss of the most extraordinary journey in the world , for the spirit of the Orient departs when the locomotive enters . Gone will be that growing sense of the grandeur and majesty of God 's creation , which is experienced as one moves slowly through these gorges to their climax in the Woosang Gorge , where thirteen peaks rise one above another five thousand feet into the clouds . No longer will there be the thrill of danger overcome , and one will not hear the weird antiphonal songs of the boatmen as they ply the oar or swing along the shore , nor join in their whistled prayer as they call to the spirit-winds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang-bang of the firecrackers , set off from the rear of the boat to loose the grip of the demons that hold us fast in the rapids , and we shall miss the odor of the incense burned at the bow as a favor to the gods . Such passing sights as the trained cormorant catching fish for his master , the gold-washers scouring the gravel for its gold , and the daily sport of half a hundred men struggling to be the first to devour his morning rice will not be encountered or enjoyed . Neither can we challenge another boat , bearing another flag , for a thirty days ' race to the city of Chung-king , and reap the joy of finishing with the stars and Stripes waving a salute to a worthy foeman less than one hundred feet behind at the end of the five-hundred-mile journey . CHUNG-KING AND BEYOND Chung-king , at which we have arrived , is a walled city with 600,000 inhabitants , situated at the confluence of the Yangtze and the Ilia-ling rivers , and is , through the fiction of a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is 1,500 miles from the coast and 1,000 feet above the level of the sea . It is now the head of steam navigation for nearly a dozen steamers controlled by the Chinese , the seat of maritime customs for the West , the point of distribution for all western-borne commerce and the assembling depot for all shipments to other parts of China and foreign lands . The chief exports to America and other countries are paint oils of the tung-tree , medicines , bristles , feathers , and hides , and , of manufactured articles , silks , satins , and crepes of the finest grades . Confined between its two rivers , this city , like New York , is growing into the air . It has no suburban lines to relieve its surplus population , and real estate has accordingly increased in the past decade from Too to 200 per cent in value , making it profitable to erect fine foreign buildings , in which it excels any purely native city in China . The English , French , German , Japanese , and Americans have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , with the English in the lead . United States trade is represented in kerosene , sewing-machines , cigarettes , patent medicines , hardware , and nails . A 300-MILE TRIP IN A SEDAN-CHAIR From Chung-king northwestward 300 miles to Cheng-tu we travel by sedanchair , borne on the shoulders of two , three , or four bearers , as one 's avoirdupois requires or his Troy weight permits ; for the rich ride in fours by choice , as do the portly without option . In addition to the chair-bearers , the foreign traveler requires a coolie to bear his cot and bedding , another to carry his food , and an attendant to cook it . A  | small party easily becomes a regiment , and if an armed escort accompanies it , as a usual , the party resembles an army . - Beyond the walls of Chung-king we enter the city of the dead . We pass square-built tombs of the Ming period ; near by are the crowded lines of public graves for beggars and the very poor ; and then , far away to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the regulation mounds of Chinese graves , with here and there beautifully carved , terraced mausoleums . A more orderly section of broad extent , reserved for Mohammedan graves , shows that the followers of the Crescent are no mean or inconsiderable company among the city 's population . Over these sleeping camps the telegraph lines are now strung and the Cheng-tu Railway will tunnel beneath them . Factories and homes are pushing them farther from the city , which is a sure indication that the hand of superstition is losing its grip , for a quarter century ago this would have spelled r-i-o-t . The Sze-chuanese from of old have been expert workers in stone , as is evidenced by the many tombs , homes , and places of defense carved deep into the rocky cliffs along the rivers . Their Chinese conquerors have inherited this art along with their land , for the country abounds with artistically carved stone bridges and memorial arches of massive proportions ornately wrought in stone . One never sees a monument dedicated  | to a warrior , but many to virtuous widows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others reared by royal permit have the four characters Wu Kia Tong Tang , five generations living together in one home . This , though not common , is by no means unknown in West China , and surely , if five generations can live together in one home and live peaceably. they deserve recognition , and the Chinese accord it , as these massive stone and tile mosaic monuments attest ( see illustration in color ) . THE LAND OF PAGODAS West China might be called " The Land of the Pagoda , " for nearly every city has its towering sentinel from three to fifteen stories in height . They are generally placed upon some eminence overlooking the city they protect , and may have served as watch-towers in times of trouble , but the real purpose of their erection most likely was to exert a benign influence upon the fang suei ? the spirits of wind and wave that bring prosperity and ward off disaster . Out from the crush and the hum of the city of the living and past the quiet camp of the dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country of the Western world ; rather a mass of terraced paddy fields and farm gardens , with human beings always in sight . People are the only feature of the landscape that we can not leave behind or ignore ; so we stop here in our journey to glance at the inhabitants of Sze-chuan , who surpass in rugged diversity of race the variety of the province 's scenery . More valuable than its rich mineral deposits and superbly tilled land , the people of Sze-chuan are at once its prime asset and interest . THE FOUR EPOCHS OF THE SZECHUANESE Your epochs mark the Sze-chuanese and help to explain them : First , the slow retreat of the ancient aborigines up into the mountains of the south and west and the occupation of the fertile land by the oncoming victorious Chinese . Second , the ruthless Chinese wars , culminating in the ravages of the tyrant Chang , who , in accordance with his slogan , " Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! for all men are evil , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . Third , the repeopling of the province by emigrants from the north , central , and southeastern provinces of China , who , fusing with the scattered Chinese and aboriginal inhabitants and with Mohammedan mercenaries from western Asia , formed the composite Sze-chuanese , styled " Chinese , with a difference . " Fourth , the contact of Christian life and thought upon these peoples , a period of reforms and revolutions , a transition from the old order to the New China of today and the China of promise of tomorrow . Prof. Edward A. Ross , author of " The Changing Chinese , " says of them : " Those who have known these people longest question whether in a match on even terms our own race could keep up with them . Their physiognomy tends to be intellectual and refined , with little of the Mongolian cast of feature . One comes on youthful shepherds who recall the wonderful shepherd Antinous , who became the favorite of the Emperor Hadrian . " Oval faces with penciled , arching eyebrows , fine eyes , delicate temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that male beauty went out with the Greeks . " Of course , the yellow race can never match the whites in charm of tint ; but , as regards mold , I doubt if there is anywhere a countenance more worthy of the supermen of the year 10,000 A. D. than that of the high-bred Chinese . " " THE MUSEUM OF THE HUMAN RACES " The picture may be somewhat overembellished , but one notes , however , one objection . There are too many of them ! It is this complex human amalgam that eye call the Sze-chuanese who occupy the eastern half of the province . The western part of Sze-chuan might well be called the Museum of the Human Races , the as-yet-undiscovered happy hunting-ground of the ethnologist and physiognomist . Here are to be found the surviving remnants in the most heroic struggle for existence that humanity has ever waged and who , for lack of a better term , we call the " Tribesmen . "  | As we cross the Alin River , which , flowing south , divides the province into east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , we come upon the shambling homes of these people , hidden in impassable ravines or perched upon cliff or mountain side , of which they seem to be part and counterpart ; for as the irresistible side-thrust of continental Asia pushed these mountain masses high into the snows and left them crumpled , broken , and isolated stormswept peaks , so , evidently , a similar convulsion of powerful peoples of Asia , in their movements toward this center , have driven back the weaker or defenseless nations , they in their turn being compelled to follow into these inaccessible places , where , like the mountains to which they still cling , they may yet reveal for us , stratum by stratum , the bedrock of the race . " THE SZE-CHUAN TRIBESMEN " The Chinese call them " The Eighteen Nations , " but it is believed that there are several times eighteen nations or tribes , each under its own king , council , or feudal lord , independent or semi-independent of each other and of the Chinese in whose borders they dwell . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white branches of the human family , and some of them , especially the dwarf peoples , are believed to be of very ancient origin . On the western side these Sze-chuanese are flanked by the Tibetans , who have spread their religious ideas among many of them . l , itang , the best known of the border lamaseries , is situated in one of the mountain passes on the roof of the world at an elevation of 14,000 feet . Here , in this sparsely settled country , there are crowded together not less than three thousand lamas , whose chief virtue is bigotry and whose daily service and joy is robbery of the people for whom they pray . Returning to the big road to Cheng-tu , we stop to notice the swiftly moving army of carriers , each with his minimum   load of 106 pounds on an average journey of thirty miles . Nothing is on wheels . Not a wheeled vehicle is seen in all West China except the wheelbarrow , near Cheng-tu . Thousands of tons of commerce pass over these highways annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we approach the centers of population we find the sewage and the water of the city are on their backs also . A NATION ON THE BACKS OF MEN The " Back of Man " is the unwritten epic of this land ; for , Atlas-like , it bears the world upon it . The coal and other minerals from the mountains ; the cities , with their walls and towers and all that they contain ; the wood on the hills and the grain of the plain ? all , together with the pigs en route to market and the men who can afford it all have ridden or ride upon the back of man . The reason is not far to seek . It is purely economic . Man is the most efficient machine and the cheapest animal , and so it comes to pass that he is the universal animal , the omnibus of commerce and the pact : - mule of the race . It is cheaper to wear men clown than keep roads up . When he falls , few care and still fewer pity , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to take the burden from his shoulder , he would regard it as taking the rice from his bowl . Sharing with these carriers the burden of the nation 's life is the proverbial " Man with the Hoe , " usually a poor tenant giving half his crop for the rent of his acre . Frequently , however , he is able to own his own implements and a water-buffalo , with which he plows his own and his neighbor 's plot , receiving in turn his neighbor 's help in seed-time and harvest . Still others , and on the rich Cheng-tu plain they are numerous , are wealthfarmers , who live in fine homes and till their estates with the help of sons and grandsons or with hired servants . To these farmers is given the task of feeding a nation of 60,000,000 people ; for Sze-chuan , isolated by mountain barriers , must be self-sustaining . The measure of this task is appreciated when we consider that fully 5o per cent of the 181,000 square miles of Sze-chuan is too mountainous for cultivation , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-half that of the State of Texas . Add to this condition his lack of scientific knowledge and the primitive implements with which he labors , as well as the necessity of securing and returning to the soil , as fertilizers , all that he reaps from it : remember , also , that rice , his chief cereal crop , is the most difficult of all cereals to produce , especially in a country where the hills must be terraced and water lifted to fill the paddy fields , and it becomes evident that the Sze-chuan farmer 's task is next to impossible and its accomplishment little short of a miracle . He is , however , favored with a temperate climate all the year and a naturally rich soil , an atmosphere saturated with moisture , an abundant rainfall , and a never-failing supply of water for irrigation from the melting snows on the mountains near by . He produces nearly every vegetable and grain found in our market and others to which we are strangers . The fruits that are ours are his also . Apples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange are second to none and are produced in great abundance . One thousand oranges on the upper Yangtze can be purchased for 50 cents . He knows little of the science of gardening , but much of its method . By interplanting , especially beans and peas , which he knows improves the quality of the soil ; by crop rotation , which he knows increases his yield , and by intensive fertilizing and the sowing o f vetch in the fallow season , he manages to keep his fields rich and raises from two to six crops a year . He has made Sze-chuan known as the Garden of Asia , the land where famine never conies . RICE THE MASTER CROP The tenant farmer pays his rent with the major portion of his rice , which is the master crop and his chief concern and joy in life . In the early spring he plows his paddy fields , and then prays for rains to flood them , offering incense to the god of the garden , whose shrine is built near by . When rain and gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot-treadle  | pumps , laboriously lifting into his terraced fields the water that he has conserved in the valley . Then , breaking up the rice sod , which has been grown from early sowing in highly fertilized plots , he transplants it in hills in the watered paddy fields . The roily water makes the hoeing of his rice field impossible ; so he does not hoe it ; he toes it . With bare foot he feels about the plant with his toes , and if he finds a weed , he toes it out ; then presses the dirt firmly in place again . With his right foot he toes two rows , with his left foot he toes two rows , and thus he toes four rows as he goes . That 's the way he hoes . Then come the tares , which the novice can not distinguish from the rice . Unlike the Bible story , he does not leave them till the harvest , but pulls them loose and casts them upon the highway to be trodden under foot . For the harvest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut with the sickle , gathered in bundles , and the grain beaten out by striking it upon slats in the center of a large bin which is pulled along after the threshers . Dried upon bamboo mats , rolled and cleaned , it is then ready to be transported to market . The native 's fondness for rice is proverbial . Corn and wheat he regards as poor substitutes , and sweet potatoes too plebeian for any but the beggar to enjoy . THE WONDERFUL SALT WELLS OF SZE-CHUAN About midway between Chung-king and Cheng-tu we are tempted by the long trains of salt carriers to turn aside and see the renowned salt industry at Tszliuching , which means " Flowing Well . " Its origin is lost in antiquity , being first mentioned in the reign of the Minor IIan Dynasty in Sze-chuan , A. D. 221-263 . With its forest of derricks , it resembles an oil boom town . The wells have been drilled by foot-power to a depth of 2,400 feet for brine and about 2,800 for natural gas , which is used exclusively for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government revenue and its production is guarded most jealously to prevent monopoly . The proprietor of the salt well can not own a gas well or evaporating plant . Likewise , the owner of the gas well or evaporating pans can not engage in the other branches of the industry , thus making each dependent upon the other and preventing family or government control . There are no flowing wells now , the brine being lifted in bamboo buckets about 5o feet in length and four to five inches in diameter . The power is supplied by water-buffaloes , hitched in fours to a 6o-foot horizontal drum , about which the rope fastened to the bucket winds as the animals are beaten around the circle at a wild gallop . The magnitude of the industry may be gleaned from the fact that every family demands its weekly pound of salt , and that many tons are exported each month to other provinces . THE " EMBROIDERED CITY " IN A FERTILE PLAIN Returning once more to the Big Road and passing without comment its towns and cities , located about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfect Capital , a vice-regal city of half a million people , ruling over Sze-chuan and Tibet . It is surrounded by a finely constructed brick wall , 35 to 40 feet in height , with a thickness at the top of 20 feet and a circumference of more than nine miles . Cheng-tu is an ancient capital , its first recorded wall being built 2,315 years ago . Marco Polo described it as a trinity of cities beautifully embellished . Its approaches were carved marble bridges which spanned its moat . Its wall , nearly 20 miles in circumference , inclosing a population of more than a million , was surrounded by rows of hibiscus trees , which in autumn bloom made it the " Embroidered City , " a name that has long outlived the wall and its trees . Some conception of the toil required to erect such a wall may be gained from the historical records , which state that the construction of one of its extensions , eight miles in length , required an army of 100,000 men and 9,600,000 days ' work . Cheng -- tu has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This plain is said to have one of the finest and most ancient systems of irrigation in the world . It was perfected about  | 200 B. C. by Li Ping , who has since become the patron saint of Cheng-tu ? the only instance of which I am aware where a civil engineer has become a patron saint . He divided the Min into three great delta systems of rivers and canals , which radiate to all parts of the 8o-mile plain . The waters are united again in two main streams , which leave the southwest and southeast borders of the plain by the Min and the Lin rivers . He left the people this motto for regulating the canals : " Keep the banks low and the bottom clean " ; and this wise counsel has prevented the disastrous floods of ancient times , while furnishing a never-failing supply of mountain water for the fields . AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL INFLUENCES It is not , however , this fertile plain , with its irrigation and teeming millions ; nor the city , with its ancient culture and modern shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean , that claims chief consideration , but a modern institution rising just beside it ; for , interesting as is Old China , with its walled-in peoples and civilization , it holds no such world significance as the China of today , which such institutions have in large measure made possible . We arc familiar with the magnitude and importance of the work of American colleges at Constantinople and Beirut , in the Near East ; but the far-reaching and beneficent work of the Christian colleges in the Far East is not so generally recognized . In marked contrast to the European missionaries , who have placed comparatively little emphasis on education in China , and especially higher education , the American missionary enterprise and Christian education have from the first been inseparable and almost synonymous . In the training of China 's sons the American missionary not only prepared many of the men who have taken high place in the life of the nation , but he created the impulse that led the sons of its first families to America to complete their education . When the Manchu Dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a new dynasty or to re-establish the old Han Dynasty of 4,600 years ago , it was a small group of men trained in Christian and American colleges who were the Jefferson and Hamilton of the Chinese Constitution and who brought the most ancient of monarchical countries in line with the democracy of our day- . The intimate relation of the Christian college to the progress of the nation is not , however , limited to parliament . Graduates of these colleges are superintending its great iron and steel plants . directing its railways and telegraphs : holding portfolios in the cabinet and sitting upon the Supreme Bench : directing in large measure the educational policy - of the nation and bearing their full share of the spiritual responsibilities in the church , the Christian schools , and the Y. M. C. A. Should we look into the embassies of that great , so , called heathen nation , we meet Dr. V. K. Wellington Koo at Washington and at London Hon. Alfred S. K. Sze , M. A. , both graduates of a Chinese Christian college . CHANGING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , is not confined to China , but it has found Christian education in that nation its worst enemy . Many of the gods of yesterday have been tumbled into the ash-heap to make wav for the school-boy with his books , and what was religion to many yesterday is useless superstition today . Customs that were respected hitherto are now despised . For centuries little children have been bound at the altar of custom to hobble with constricted feet to a painful old age . Preaching and protest went unheeded until the Christian girls ' schools demonstrated that big - footed women were the queens of the land , not its slaves . Students now in government schools are announcing that they will not marry girls who have not natural feet . and girls with bound feet parade the streets with their little feet in big boots . The reason is evident . Big feet and brains have come to be synonymous . Government schools are refusing admission to bound-footed girls , and the better classes are in the big-foot crusade . Women in useful service have come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
