With gleaming tusks , spotted skins , Africa lures the hunter . With savage tribes , brilliant plumage , exotic flowers , Africa calls to the explorer and the naturalist . But to the 20th century industrialist , eagerly scanning the world 's wealth , the world 's markets , Africa means first RAW MATERIALS , then CHEAP LABOR . Palm oil , extracted from the fruit of the African oil palm , the basis of many a soap , drew William Hesketh Lever to Africa in 1911 ( see p. 17 ) . More and more oil was needed for Lever Brothers ' gigantic plant at Port Sunlight , England . The Congo held a vast , almost virginal source of supply . Into the Congo , 1,000 miles , went British industrialism , dutifully accompanied by British medicine , British education . Lever Brothers became rulers of a black empire of 1,860,000 acres , exploited its mine of raw materials , its cheap labor . Last week , black labor in the Congo demanded and got 19 a day . Like the soap works at Port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be served . From one source or another , an unending supply of rubber must pour into the plant of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co . Angry at the cost of obtaining it from one source ( British ) , Harvey Samuel Firestone determined to get it from another . Said he : " Americans Should Produce Their Own Rubber . " Thus U. S. industrialism went to Africa , in the person of white-belmeted , soft-spoken Harvey Samuel Firestone Jr .. with engineers , chemists , physicians , builders . The Firestones chose Liberia for the first all-American rubber plantation . With typical U. S. efficiency , the groundwork was laid by refinancing the shiftless Liberian government , then obtaining the right to plant rubber trees over an area of 1,000,000 acres . With typical U. S. generosity , Mr. Firestone paid more than the average African wage . Liberian blacks receive 25 a day , in cash . Last week , the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations was called upon to read a curious document . It was a report , made by onetime Harvard professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junod , President of the International Society for the Protection of Natives . Declared Professor Buell , in effect : " Firestone forced its way into Liberia . The U. S. State Department and Herbert Hoover brought pressure to bear to make the Liberian government accept the refinancing operations and admit Firestone rubber . Eventually , the lands of the natives will be confiscated . Through the terms of the loan , through U. S. financial advisers , a closed door has been established . It will end in peonage . " Shocked , the State Department issued vigorous and sweeping denials . The Firestones have used but 20,000 of its 1,000,000 acres . The U. S. will not countenance closed doors , forced labor . <P> . . . <P> From Detroit , last week , sailed the motorship Lake Ormoc , carrying hospital equipment , an experimental laboratory , machine shop , refrigerating plant , provisions for two years . Its destination : Santarem , Brazil , a river port 100 miles north of Henry Ford 's new 5,000,000 acre rubber plantation . In ten years , Mr. Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber annually , enough to make 1,000,000,000 Ford tires.
