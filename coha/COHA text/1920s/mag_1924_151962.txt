Prince Luis Fernando Maria , 35-year-old son of the Infanta Eulalia , aunt of King Alfonso , was , last week , ousted from France without reason by order of the French Minister of the Interior . <P> Said he at his quarters in Paris : " Persecution ! The Radicals want to make themselves disagreeable to Spanish royalty and picked on me . What did I do ? I went to a house one night where , I suppose , one ought not to go ; but I had been there before in excellent company if I cared to name it- the kind of place American tourists , anxious to see something they should n't , go to in large numbers . <P> " I was recognized ; they tried to blackmail me . I refused , called for the police and now I am singled out for expulsion . I go . I exile myself , though I am more Parisian than most , as I spent my childhood here . <P> " I have given to Parisian charities even beyond my means . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Austrian relatives out of sympathy for France and now I am expelled . . . I am going to England for a few weeks . . . . Then I probably shall visit America . I know many charming American ladies and for several years have been planning to visit them . " <P> In Madrid , the blue blood of King Alfonso , of whom Don Luis is a cousin , went black with rage . In a decree calling attention to the Prince 's undignified behavior , the King deprived him of all honor due to a Prince of the blood .
