Perhaps the Greeks , notoriously fickle , want a King , instead of the President ( Alexander Zaimis ) their Parliament has just " elected ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) . Last week obstreperous old Prime Minister Eleutherios Venizelos , 100% democrat and " Father of the Greek Republic , " flung a bold challenge to Royalist Leader Panagiotis Tsaldaris . <P> " I am willing to hold a plebiscite here and now , " he announced , " on the issue of whether Greece shall remain a republic . " <P> Promptly . Tsaldaris henchmen sneered that of course the foxy " Old Man of Crete " would like to stage a plebiscite while his Government controls the Ministry of . Interior . The Minister of Interior conducts all Greek elections , is supposed to win most of them . <P> " I will amplify my offer , " snapped bristling-mustached M. Venizelos next day . " I offer M. Tsaldaris the portfolio of Interior for the period of the plebiscite ! " <P> Greek knows Greek . Tsaldaris knew that there must be aces up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rolled elbow high . Said he sulkily : " I will reserve my decision until I can investigate . " <P> In Bucharest the news from Athens warmed the cockles of many a Rumanian heart . One of the sons-in-law of dynamic Dowager Queen Marie is insipid Georgios II , deposed King of the Hellenes . Doubtless he would resume his rule if by any remote chance Greece should go Royalist . <P> In 1924 Greeks plebiscited 758,742 for the Republic and only 325,322 for gorgeous Georgios , still one of the best-dressed men in Europe . He now lives in London , partly on the bounty of George V with whom he often dines , week ends .
