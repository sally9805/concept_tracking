On Palm Sunday , in Elizabeth , N. J. , one Edward Fitzgerald , 22 , was eating raspberry jelly for dessert and thinking holy thoughts . He was about to take a last delicious mouthful when he gave a cry and waved his spoon in the air . There , right in his dessert plate , was St. Thrse , the Little Flower of Jesus . He had often seen her statue in churches . The image that now stared up out of his dish was precisely like these except that it was made out of fruit jelly and whipped cream . " Mother , come here ! " cried Edward Fitzgerald . Mrs. Michael J. Fitzgerald , like her son , saw the saint in the jelly . <P> Awed by this humble example of transmogrification , Edward Fitzgerald quickly gave $25 to further the fund for building a shrine to St. Thrse in San Antonio , Tex . In the meantime , gossip brought visitors to the Fitzgerald house , each visitor anxious to view the jellied saint . One of the visitors was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Catholic Church , who urged that the image be given over into the keeping of ecclesiastical authorities-supposing , perhaps , that if the trembling statue had already held its shape for a period of 24 hours , it might , in holy surroundings , endure almost forever . The Fitzgeralds consented to this course , then they closed their house to the pilgrim crowds that lingered at their door . <P> It was absurd enough , no doubt , that any one should take seriously this religious revolt in the dessert ; yet the incident has a value beyond the comic . Why did Edward Fitzgerald fancy that he saw the face of St. Thrse , the Little Flower of Jesus , fashioned in his tidbit ? Why not the face of St. Cecilia , St. Helen or the beautiful St. Priscilla ? Saints , like dresses , have their fashions and their vogues ; once it will be the stern St. Catherine , next the dashing Joan of Arc . Right now , the most popular Catholic saint is Soeur Thrse , the Carmelite nun , who died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 25 , 1925 ) <P> Sister Thrse Martin was one of the nine children of a jeweler of Alenon , a provincial town in Brittany . In 1889 , at the age of 16 , she entered the Carmelite Nunnery at Lisieux ; eight years later she died of tuberculosis . That would have been all that was ever known of St. Thrse had she not , at the request of her Mother Superior , written an autobiography , whose future publication she never imagined . In this , with bewildering and beautiful humility , Soeur Thrse confided her desire not to leave the earth when she was dead but to stay , to help other people in the world who were unhappy and distressed . She thought that she " would spend her Heaven on earth doing good " ; that she would " let fall a shower of roses . " The simple beauty of her book , which is the beauty of herself , is beyond description ; but in her " heaven on earth " fatal diseases were cured , as doctors testified before her canonization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the book that Soeur Thrse wrote ; soldiers in the War died praying to her , saying her name .
