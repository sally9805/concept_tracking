In the April number of Columbia , the Knights of Columbus magazine . Mr. Justice Joseph Morschauser ( also of the New York State Supreme Court-who presided at the Stillman case and other divorce suits ) advocated the abolition of divorce in the United States . " Divorce , " said he , " is a cancer in the vitals of American life . . . . From my experience on the bench I know that halfway reforms are ineffective . The only way to cure the evils of divorce is to completely abolish divorce . " This he proposes to do eventually by Constitutional amendment , but more immediately by refusing to recognize decrees granted to Americans in foreign countries , and by taking the power to perform the marriage ceremony out of the hands of irresponsible people , such as County Clerks and Justices of the Peace , who will marry almost anyone at a moment 's notice . Justice Morschauser advocates this reform only as a measure to protect the home and national morality , and would still allow separation , which he believes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage laws .
