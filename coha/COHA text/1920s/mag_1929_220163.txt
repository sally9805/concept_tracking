Sir Joseph Duveen , international art tycoon , has emerged unscathed if not triumphant from three $500,000 libel suits . In 1915 Art Dealer Edgar Gorer failed to prove that Sir Joseph 's opinionizing had spoiled the sale of a Kang Hsi vase to the late , great collector Henry Clay Frick . In 1921 Mrs. Harry Hahn of Kansas City brought a suit which only last fortnight came to a bootless halt ( TIME , Feb. 18 et seq . ) . In 1923 suit was brought by the late Art Dealer George Joseph Demotte of Manhattan , which ceased when Mr. Demotte was accidentally shot to death while hunting in France . <P> Thus the bland Sir Joseph may well believe in an angelic guardian . But he must have felt twinges of both chagrin and resentment , last week , when it was announced that the Duveen opinions which had caused the Demotte suit had been sharply repudiated . <P> Dealer Demotte owned a statuette of the Virgin and Child which he called a 13th century Limoges enamel . He was fond of describing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caused a niche to be cut under the pommel of her saddle to contain the statuette . With this tiny shrine she could jaunt while worshiping , or worship while jaunting . <P> The statuette fascinated the late Michael Dreicer , famed Manhattan jeweller . Shortly before his death he arranged to buy it for 350,000 francs . After he died , the bank handling the Dreicer estate engaged Sir Joseph Duveen to pass judgment on the authenticity of the statuette , for which 100,000 francs had already been paid . Sir Joseph called it a modern fake , and the bank promptly refused further payments . Mr. Demotte brought suit . Sir Joseph insisted that he had libeled no one , but had merely expressed a solicited opinion . Mr. Demotte 's death kept the affair from the courts . <P> Last week Lucien Demotte , son of the late dealer , announced that other experts had called the enamel statuette genuine , and that the Dreicer estate had accordingly paid in full a sum of approximately $14,000.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
