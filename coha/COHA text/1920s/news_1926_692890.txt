txt The universal belief that the present subtay strike will fail is one reason why it will fail . It alienated public sympathy from the start . This was not merely because it threatened Inconvenience to thousands of people . What the citY saw and greatly disliked was , first of all , an attempt to break up a labor union covering the whole subway which had functioned satisfactorily for several years . It is true that the striking motormen and switchmen are made to speak of the Brotherhood of Subway Workers as " a reptile company union . " But it was too obvious that they broke away from it with the idea of making their own particular interest superior to that of the entire body of employes and also superior to that of the public . in the present state ' of popular sentiment on the whole subject , such an attitude condemns the workmen who take it to defeat . Apparently , the strikers committed nearly every blunder possible . They served ultimatums , only to withdraw or modify them . - They voted one Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They rejected the plans and appeals of the Transit Commission and then offered a scheme of their own which was so fantastic as to be declined out of hand . This , certainly , was . no way to rouse the enthusiasm or stiffen the purposes of the men whom the leaders and organizers of the improvised union were trying to rally behind them . This strike bears every sign of being beaten before it fairly got under way . To date , it is more of a nuisance than a menace . Yet it should not be allowed to pass without prompting to serious thought about what the public can do to protect itself in such cases . Every cleareyed person perceives that there is a difference between an ordinary strike and a strike on a public utility . The two are morally distinct , and they ought to , be so legally . No orfe can fail to admit the injustice of allowing men to fight out their wage contests with a company , not . on the pure merits of their case , but according as they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distress a large body of - men , women aricl children that a public clamor will he roused and employers forced to yield what in simple equity they ought not to yield . Until now the ' law has not been able to deal effectively with this danger to the community . Public ? pint ten is at present the main dependence , and public opinion against a strike usually means its doom . Another hope has been created by the growth of self-government within given , industries . When corporations and the unions working for them can combine In a system of common effort for the correction of abuses and for the sharing of profits , the probability of a strike js much lessened . Yet , as has been seen . the very existence of such a system on the Interborough was a reason given by the strikers for their course . In the act , they condemned themselves as selfishly seeking for their small group what they knew ' was out of the reach of the many thousands of their fellows . Thus it is to be hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushing that the Interborough Brotherhood will be quickly re-established as the best means ofkeeping'ihe peace within the industry and at the same time serving : the public properly .
