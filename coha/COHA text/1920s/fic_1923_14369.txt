The scene is laid in the combined sitting and bed-room of SAM TUCKER 'S home . The interior is somewhat better furnished than that of the usual Negro tenant farmer in North Carolina . At the right front is a desk and a bookcase filled with books . A pile of magazines and newspapers lies upon the book-case . These are rarely found among this type of people . A large fire-place is at the right rear with a green oak wood fire burning . The hearth and facings of the chimney are whitewashed . The mantel is trimmed in white crepe paper somewhat the worse for smoke . A large silent Seth Thomas clock with one hand sits on the mantel . And on either side of it are several patent medicine bottles , salve boxes , an alarm clock , and a large bladder of snuff . A bed is to the right of the fireplace , and at its foot to the rear a window . Between the bookcase and the bed a door leads into the kitchen . A woodbox filled with wood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box and the left corner of the room a door leads into a back room called " the entry . " At the left center a door opens on the front porch . Nearer the front and to the left sits a large home-made chest . Above this several dresses , coats , and worn out hats hang . Four or five splint-bottomed chairs are about the room . Here and there on the walls flare bright calendars of stock powder companies and illustrations clipped from magazines . Tacked to the wall to the left of the clock is a motto in time-worn letters : " We are Rising . " The drawn curtain discloses SAM TUCKER at his desk near the front , writing by a lighted Rayo lamp . He is a powerful , heavily * All rights reserved . For permission to produce , address the author , University of North Carolina Chapel Hill , N. C. Music for the songs and ballads in the play will be sent upon request . built light mulatto of about forty-five , with prominent features , and short hair slightly graying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , army shirt , and necktie . There is a sleepless , haggard look about his face , and now and then a rumbling cough interrupts him . From a first glance one would say that he could have gone far in the world . His forehead is high , and the whole cut of his head impressive . But on a second look one senses by the wide nostril and sensuous lip that the journey to greatness would be through a mighty struggle with self . It would be guessed that reason and feeling are at continuous war within him and that when passion is in possession he is dangerous . With a kindly environment perhaps the reasonableness of his nature would have led him to accomplishments and peace . Farther back and to the right of the fireplace sits MUH TUCK dozing and quarreling in her rocking-chair . Her head and face are almost completely hidden in a large slat bonnet . She wears heavy ragged shoes and dark unkempt dress . A dirty pink " fascinator " is draped over her thin shoulders . A huge snuff brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of waving motion when she moves her jaws in sleep . Between her knees she clasps a walking-stick . Through the window at the rear comes the faint afterglow from the west . The November sun has set and the sky is rapidly settling into a grey . In the oaks outside the sparrows going to roost make a medley of sounds . The alarm clock ticks loudly on the mantel . For a moment or two , SAM continues his writing and then turns partially towards MUH TUCK and speaks . SAM You need n't say another word about it . I wo n't let him darken my door . ( MUH TUCK stirs from her doze and sniffles into a dirty rag , wiping the rheumy tears from her eyes . SAM turns to his writing for another moment , then lays down his pen and stretches his arms back of his head with a weary yawn . He looks toward MUH TUCK and speaks exultantly . ) That 's the best I 've ever done . They ca n't go against that , they can't. p. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .  --  Thank God you 's finished yo ' speech and 'll soon be outen my sight and I kin git a liddle nap . SAM ( Not noticing her ) .  --  That crowd 's going to listen to me tonight . MUH TUCK ( Scornfully ) .  --  Mebbe dey will , but you 's talked yo ' life away , and it hai n't come to nothing . SAM ( Looking at his speech ) .  --  I 've done my best this ti All I got from books and experience is there , and the truth 's in ( He gathers the closely-written sheets together . ) I tell ' erm ( He turns to his speech and begins to read as he rises from his chanI say , Ladies and gentlemen ( He does not notice the movem of disgust MUH TUCK makes as she turns away from him ) , t night is going to mean much in the lives of each and every one us , big and little . MUH TUCK Hit wo n't ef dey treats dey chil'en lak y treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  It marks the founding of The Ca Fear Training School , an institution that will one day be a lig to other institutions round about . It is to be our aim here wi the few teachers and facilities we can provide , to offer educati to the colored children amongst us and offer it cheap . ( He turns toward MUH TUCK and speaks with more spir as if his audience were directly before him . But she turns her ba to him and stares in the fire . ) Looking over the country , ladies and gentlemen , we see t million souls striving in slavery , yea , slavery , brethren , the slave of ignorance . And ignorance means being oppressed , both b yourselves and by others  --  hewers of wood and drawers of wat ( He picks up his pen and crosses out a word. ) p. 4 MUH TUCK ( Sarcastically ) .  --  Dey hai n't nobody in slaver Ef dey is , how come ? And I reckon de hewers o ' wood and drawers o ' water is ' bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues his speech . ) Ignoran means sin , and sin means destruction , destruction before the la and destruction in a man 's own heart . The Negro will rise whe his chareckter is of the nature to cause him to rise  --  for on th the future of the race depends , and that chareckter is mostly be built by education , for it can not exist in ignorance . Let m repeat that again , ladies and gentlemen . We want our children and grandchildren to march on towards full lives and nob chareckters , and that has got to come , I say , by education . W have n't no other way . We got to live clean and learn  --  an think , that 's it . ( He strides in front of the old woman who has dozed off agai as she is wont to do under his eloquence . She raises her head wit a jerk when he thunders at her . ) A little over fifty years ago the white man 's power covere us like the night . Through war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body and not freedom of the mind . And what is freedom of the body without freedom of the mind ? It do n't mean nothing , it do n't exist . ( Throwing his arm out in a long gesture . ) What we need is thinking people , people who will not let the body rule the head . And again I cry out , education . I been accused of wanting to make the Negro the equal of the white man . That is false . I never preached such doctrine . I do n't say that the colored ought to be made equal to the white in society , now . We ai n't ready for it yet . But I do say that we have equal rights to educating and free thought and living moral lives . With that all the rest will come . ( Vehemently . ) We got history to prove it . I say , it 'll come . ( Pointing to the bookcase . ) Them books there show it . ( Caught up in the dream of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air with his fist . ) Ladies and gentlemen , what 's to hinder us from starting a great center of learning here , putting our time and our hope and money and labor into it and not into the many foolishnesses of this life . What little education I got was by light'ood knots , and after reading and studying all these years , I am just a small ways along . We must give the children of the future a better chance than we have had . With this one school-building we can make a good start , then we can get more teachers later on , more equipment , and some day a library where the girls and boys can read about men that have done something for the world . And before many years pass we shall be giving instruction in how to farm , how to be carpenters , how to preach , how to teach , how to do anything . ( Forgetful of his written page , he shouts . ) And what will stop us in the end from growing into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill , a place the pride of both white and black . ( He stands a moment , lost in thought . Turning through the leaves of his speech , he looks towards MUH TUCK who sits hid under her bonnet . ) Ai n't that the truth , Muh Tuck ? Ai n't it ? ( Anxiously . ) They ca n't stand out against that , can they ? ( He coughs. ) p. 5 MUH TUCK Lawd Jesus ! You 's enough to wake de daid . And you brung on yo ' cough agin . SAM ( Fiercely ) .  --  I tell you it 's going through . I believe the people here are with me this time . MUH TUCK Sounds lak de same old tale . ( Bitterly . ) You 's made dem dere speeches from Gawgy and Alabam to I don ' know where . It 's foolishnesses , and you knows it . ( Sam arranges the leaves of his speech without listening to her . ) Time you 's learning dat white is white and black is black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so intended from beginning . SAM ( Staring at her and speaking half aloud ) .  --  We b taught and kept believing that for two hundred years . ( Blaz out . ) But it 's a lie , a lie , and the truth ai n't in it . MUH TUCK ( Going on in her whining , irritating voice ) .  --  Y all yo ' life you 's hollered Lawd and followed Devil , and look w it 's brung you to . Ef you 'd a put as much time on picking cott lately as you has on dat speech , you would n't have Mr. Tucl down on you de way he is . De truf 's in dat alright . p. 6 SAM ( Trying to control his nervousness and anger ) .  --  I ain ' farmer . My business is with schools . ( Hotly . ) Ca n't you lea nothing ? You dribbling old  --  oh , for twenty years you 've hea me talk the gospel and it ai n't made no impression on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . He speaks himself and the shadows in the room . ) That speech is so ! It 's and I got to speak it that way . ( He looks about him with burni eyes and pleads as if with an unseen power . ) The truth 's the Ca n't you see it ? ( His nostrils quiver and he goes on in a kind sob , calling to the unbeliever hiding within the dark . ) God A'migh knows they ai n't no difference at the bottom . Color hadr ought to count . It 's the man , it 's the man that lasts . ( B kenly . ) Give us the truth ! Give us the truth ! ( He coug slightly as a grey gloom settles over his face . ) MUH TUCK ( Looking at the clock and snapping ) .  --  Thoug you 's bound to be at de meeting by seven o'clock . It 's done pa time . Git on , I wants my nap . ( She pours snuff into her lip and turns to her snoozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crams his speech into his pock gets a plug hat from the desk , and blows out the lamp . The room filled with great leaping shadows. ) p. 7 SAM ( At the door ) .  --  You remember what I said about Wile MUH TUCK Git on , git on . ( Whining sarcastically . ) Sh you 'll be a light on de hill and de pride o ' de land  --  and you won even let a po ' old grandmuh see her boy . SAM ( Turning back ) .  --  Damn him . If he puts foot in th house he 'd better not let me get hold of him . They ai n't n man , flesh of my flesh or not , going to lie rotten with liquor an crooks around me And just because a little time 's passed is n reason that I 've changed . MUH TUCK Do n't go yit . He mought a changed and wants to do bedder .

You ruint him in his young days , and I do n't want nothing more to do with him . p. 8 MUH TUCK ( Mumbling to herself ) .  --  I 's gwine see him ' fo ' he he goes back out yander ef I has to crawl slam to Lillington . SAM ( With brightening eyes ) .  --  You heard me . He ai n't no longer mine , and that 's the end of it . MUH TUCK ( Bursting out in a rage ) .  --  And you ai n't none o ' mine . You 's gut all de high notions of old Colonel Tucker and do n't keer nothing foh yo ' own . Git on . Whut you skeered of , de dark ? SAM ( Shuddering and going across the room and getting an old overcoat from a nail ) .  --  Yes , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . Do you know what I am ?  --  nothing but what you had to bring in the world because you mixed with a white man , not another thing . ( The despondent look comes back to his face and he speaks more calmly . ) I 'll cut across the fields the near way , and tell Mallie not to worry , for I 'll be back by ten with the school good as started . ( At the door he turns back again and calls to the old woman earnestly ) Muh Tuck , do n't let her worry , do n't . ( She is fast asleep and does not reply . ) Let her sleep , let us all sleep . It may be we 'll need no waking . ( He goes out , closing the door softly behind him . A moment passes . The door at the left opens quietly , and WILEY BOY stealthily enters , carrying a guitar by a strap over his shoulder and a small cheap handbag in one hand . He is dressed in the clothes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse for wear  --  a gray cap , light checkered suit , red flowing tie , white collar , pink socks , and tan shoes . The guitar and handbag he places gently on the floor near the door and throws his cap on the chest . He is a dark , greasy Negro of twenty-three or four , with a distinct tinge of the mulatto showing in his reckless , dissipated face . His hair is cropped close to his head . And his pop eyes stand out above his heavy nose bold and daring . He looks around the room as if the surroundings are new to him . Coming noiselessly over to the fire , he stands looking down at MUH TUCK with a grin of amusement and affection . He starts to speak , changes his mind and picks up a charred splinter from the fire . The hot end he touches to her hand. ) p. 9 MUH TUCK ( Bounding up in spite of her seventy years a rheumatism. )  --  Lawd in heaben ! Whut 's dat ! ( She rubs her hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with repressed laughter . ) Who 's you ? I say . ( Speaking to heraelf . ) Dat laugh soun lak I knows him . ( He continues to gargle his fun . Sudden she screams and pushes her chair away from him . Brushing h bonnet from her head , she pulls her spectacles down out of her scra gly white hair , done in close knots , and puts them on her nose . A d lighted smile slowly breaks over her face . ) Lawd a muhcy , ef ' tain Wiley Boy come back agin !

Some white man 's gwine shoot his lights out one dese days , see ef de do n't . ( With a reckless forgetfulness ) And so I says gim me a fast time , a liddle gin to drown down all my troubles in , and den  --  ( He goes over to the door and gets his guitar ) , a liddle music to top it off wid . How ' bout it , Muh Tuck ? p. 21 MUH TUCK ( Straining her eyes through the shadows ) .  --  Whut you gut dere ? ( Jubilantly . ) Lawd , Lawd ! Ef you hai n't brung yo ' box wid you ! And I ai n't heerd nothing but dem sparrers by de do ' since you left two yea'h back .

My ' oman said ' t was de onliest chune . Hit 's called De Handsome Roundah . MUH TUCK Le 's have it , chile , le 's have it . And den a few o ' mine . ( WILEY BOY begins playing , and as he plays the criminal of him passes from his face , and he becomes a child full of harmless enjoyment . He starts the music slowly . After a few bars he joins in with patting feet . MUH TUCK sits tense with joy for awhile and then commences swaying from side to side in time with the music . WILEY BOY slides farther down into his chair , leaning his head back and growling out a syncopated humming sound as the melody quickens into an insistent throb . MUH TUCK pounds on the floor with her feet and stick . She quavers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He throws back his head and sings in a clear tenor voice . ) THE HANDSOME ROUNDERDe handsome roundah on his hoss , And de playing of de band.His yurnifo 'm was silver and gol ' !

( He looks at her , and they both smile as he puts " the gravey on it , " their inner natures one with the running music . ) Ai n't dat de old time stuff ? WILEY BOY ( Winking at her and beating his knuckles against the sides of the guitar . ) Say on , sister . Blab it fer and wide . Step on her , step on her . And whilst de music played he passedA-leading of his men.De ladies thought of wah and saidWe wo n't see him ag'in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosses pawed de san .

WILEY BOY ( In a broad grin ) .  --  Ai n't dat de hundred proof ! Ai n't it dough ? MUH TUCK Dat 's joy to my po ' soul , dess lak de old times . Turn her loose , turn her loose . WILEY BOY Awright  --  sho 's yo ' belly 's black . What you want ? How 'd you lak a little tech of de Band Party or Old Cotton-eyed Joe . I kin smear de grease on ' em . You knows me , honey . ( During the foregoing conversation he has not stopped playing but subdued the music , running through chords familiar to and beloved by every " toter of a box . " ) p. 23 MUH TUCK Dat 's it ! dat 's it ! Lawd , gim me de Band . I useter be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , dance all night , dess so I 's home by de broad daylight . Chile , I o 'd natchly knock de wool offen ' em . ( As WILEY plays , she chuckles and whines with delight and almost rises from her seat . As before he starts in a quiet manner , gradually working up to a paroxysm of pantomime and song . MUH TUCK begins doing the Jonah 's Band Party step with her heels and toes . WILEY BOY spreads his wriggling feet apart , leans forward with closed eyes , and commences the " call , " with the old woman 's quavering slobbering voice giving the " sponse . " ) JONAH 'S BAND PARTYCall : Sech a kicking up san ' ! Sponse : Jonah 's Ban ' ! ( This is repeated : Then comes the command to change steps . ) " Hands up sixteen and circle to de right , We 's gwine git big eatings heah tonight . " Sech a kicking up san ' ! Jonah 's Ban ' !

" Dance roun ' ' oman , show ' em de p'int , Dem yudder coons don'ter how to coonj'int . " ( By this time WILEY BOY is playing a tattoo on the wood of his box and carrying on the tune at the same time . MUH TUCK has risen from her chair . And with her dress to her knees , defying her years , she cuts several of the well-remembered steps . At sight of her bare and thin dry shanks the delirious WILEY bursts into loud mocking guffaws and only plays faster . ) The door at the right opens and MALLIE comes timidly in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his music and stops . For a moment MALLIE stands astonished in the door , holding a bulky tow-sack in her hand . She drops the sack and hurries over to WILEY. p. 24 MALLIE Muhcy me ! I knowed ' t was you soon 's I heerd de guitar . And sech carryings on ! WILEY BOY ( Rising confusedly as she comes up to him ) .  --  How you , Mam ? ( She puts her hand shyly on his arm and then clings convulsively to him , her shoulders heaving with restrained sobs . He puts one arm around her and stands looking tenderly and somewhat foolishly down at her . It is evident that in his way he cares for her . She suddenly raises her head , dries her eyes with her apron , and fetches wood from the box . ) MALLIE ( Punching the fire ) .  --  Why' n't you let me know Wiley 'd come , Muh Tuck ? MUH TUCK He dess come ' bout day down . WILEY BOY ( Laying his box on the bed ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be cold . ( She sits down wearily , and he stands with his back to the fire . MUH TUCK picks up her snuff-brush and slyly begins to dip from her tin box . ) ( MALLIE is almost a pure Negro , about forty . Her face is more kind than intelligent , and there is a strained , almost vacant look about her eyes . She is dressed in plain working clothes . ) MALLIE ( Looking at MUH TUCK somewhat reprovingly and yet kindly ) .  --  Seems lak you all was a-carrying on powerful foh a woman whut 's bout gone . p. 25 MUH TUCK ( Snappishly , yet ashamed ) .  --  Had n't we ort to celebrate a liddle and Wiley Boy come back ? ( MALLIE gazes in the fire with a look of uneasy joy . WILEY BOY shifts his weight from one foot to the other . ) MALLIE ( With a sudden start of terror ) .  --  You hai n't seed yo ' pap , has you ? MUH TUCK No . He dess left ' fo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief . ) Said he 'd be back ' bout ten o'clock . And co'se he thinks his speech de best dat ever was . Said de school was good as started . MALLIE I 's sho glad to see you , Wiley . I  --  I ai n't heerd a word foh more'n a yea'h . ( She chokes down a sob . ) WILEY BOY ( Shamefacedly ) .  --  Yeh , yeh , I kept ' specting to write . But I dess did n't feel in de notion . But it 's awright now . I 's back . MALLIE ( Looking up with a sorrowful joy in her face ) .  --  Thand de Lawd . And you 's come in a good time . We 's had trouble a heap dis last yea'h . How long you gwine stay ? WILEY BOY I guess ' bout a week . And I 's gwine sleep down at Joe Day's. p. 26 MALLIE ( Suddenly reaching out and clutching his hand to her face ) .  --  Do n't you and yo ' pap have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he  --  ai n't well and might rile easy .

MALLIE ( Slowly getting up ) .  --  You all set while I fix you some supper . I 's gut something good for Sam and de rest of us . Lemme show you . ( She brings the bag , sits down in the chair and takes out a big meaty hambone . MUH TUCK eyes it hungrily . Naively . ) Ai n't dat de finest dough ? And I gut a hog haid , too , and collards and cracklings . WILEY BOY ( Angrily ) .  --  Dat 's de way wid dem damn  --  wid dem white folks . Dey works you to death and den sheves dey old slippery meat off on you foh pay . MALLIE ( A worried look coming over her face ) .  --  You had n't ort to say dat , Wiley . Mr. Tucker gin me it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash foh my work . Sam 'll have a new bottle o ' medicine , Monday . ( She fingers the food childishly , and WILEY turns away his head with a smothered oath . Putting the food back into the bag , she stands up . ) Now I 'll git you some supper . p. 27 WILEY BOY I cai n't stay foh no supper . I promised to eat wid Joe . Le 's set and talk , ca'se we do n't have much time , and you can cook adder I 'm gone . MALLIE ( She hesitates ) .  --  Well  --  lemme put dese heah in de kitchen den .

MUH TUCK And ef it 's trouble dat ails her , I reckings as how you 's done yo ' shur in bringing it . ( He swallows his reply as MALLIE comes in . She lights the lamp then sits down and begins staring in the fire. ) p. 28 WILEY BOY ( After turning from one side to the other ) .  --  Mammy , whut 's de matter wid you ? MALLIE ( Brushing her hand across her face and looking up as she wipes the tears from her eyes ) .  --  Lawd bless you , chile , dey ai n't  --  dey ai n't nothing . I 's dess happy to be wid you . ( She catches his hand and holds it a moment , then drops it and begins to look in the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if somewhat awed by her manner . ) Cai n't you play something else on de box . ( Quickly . ) But I do n't want none o ' dem ungodly pieces lak whut you was playing when I come in . WILEY BOY ( Eagerly ) .  --  Yeh , lemme play a liddle something fer you .

You  --  had n't ort  --  ( She looks appealingly at WILEY . ) WILEY BOY ( Brusquely and beginning to pluck the strings ) .  --  Aw dat 's awright . I did n't say nothing . ( A screech owl calls from the hollow back of the house. ) p. 29 MUH TUCK Ugh !  --  listen dere , listen dere at dat scritch owl . WILEY BOY ( Starting ) .  --  Aw de devil !

She hug me and she kiss me  --  Oh , heaben de tech o ' her han ' ! She said I was de puttiest thingIn de shape o ' mortal man . I told her dat I love her , Dat my love was bedcord strong , And I axed her  --  MALLIE ( Crying out in agitation ) .  --  I cai n't listen to dat . It 's blaspheaming de Lawd ! ( WILEY BOY lets the music die away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice : )  --  when she 'd have me , And she dess says " Go ' long . " p. 30 MALLIE " Tai n't right . Dat 's a fast song . And I ai n't feeling lak no world'y reels . Gim me my old piece . MUH TUCK ( In a hypocritically sad voice ) .  --  Give us dat piece , chile . We 's had trouble , and mo ' trouble 's coming . WILEY BOY ( Ironically ) .  --  In co'se you 's had trouble and balanced on de brink o ' hell . MALLIE Yeh , yeh , play it . ( Fervidly . ) In dat turble Judgment Day ( WiLEY shivers. ) de Lawd 's gwine pay ' em back foh whut Sam 's had to suffer in dis world . De people 'll see , de people ' ll see ! ( She clasps and unclasps her hands nervously . ) WILEY BOY ( Mournfully ) .  --  Allus thinking o ' him . MALLIE ( With flashing eyes ) .  --  Play it ! ( WILEY glances at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which necessitates sliding his fingers on the strings in such a way as to cause them to give out a sound like a deep far-off groan . ) MUH TUCK ( Shivering and drawing her fascinator around her ) .  --  Ugh !  --  ( Again WILEY BOY starts nervously . MALLIE rubs her hands together , with a strange look set on her face. ) p. 31 MALLIE Sing it ! sing it , I say . WILEY BOY I cai n't sing it  --  I cai n't sing dat . ( Nevertheless his fingers go on playing . And caught in the spell of the song , he begins to sing . ) Judgment 's A-ComingJudgment 's a-coming , Judgment 's a-coming ! God 's gwine speak from outen de sky , All sinners gwine be burnt wid fi ' . Judgment 's a-coming , Judgment 's a-coming ! Judgment Day . MUH TUCK ( Whispering .  --  Lawd Jesus ! have muhcy on me !

Judgment Day . MUH TUCK ( In an ecstacy of terror ) .  --  God in heaben ! Jedgment 's a-coming ! O Lawd , snatch dis po ' bran ' from de burning ! ( WILEY BOY falters . MALLIE sits staring in the fire , wrapt away before the terrors of that great day when the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll . ) Judgment 's a-coming , Judgment 's a-coming ! De dark 's gwine kiver from sho ' to sho ' , And de angel wid de trumpet say time 's no mo ' . Judgment 's a-coming , Judgment 's a-coming ! Judgment Day . ( His voice dies in his throat , and he stands with bowed head , as he softly picks over the words , " Judgment 's a-coming . " MUH TUCK is half sobbing out a medley of prayers and exclamations of fear . MALLIE 's lips are almost silently repeating the words of the song , her face lighted up with a demoniac joy . She sees her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their deserved rewards . For a moment the picture of the world 's destruction and the final cataclysmic change overpowers them . They remain silent before the Worker of woes . The owl calls again . MUH TUCK crouches down in her chair . WILEY BOY in a fit of nervousness turns himself about . Then he throws the guitar on the bed , shakes himself , buttons up his coat , and throws some wood on the fire . He lights a cigarette , and with the puffs his courage returns . He begins to smile and look boldly around the room. ) p. 32 MALLIE ( Speaking as one in a trance ) .  --  In dat great day , in dat great day , it 'll all come right . WILEY BOY ( Peering intently at his mother ) .  --  Ai n't we a mess o ' people to be seeing the devil streaking th'ough the shadows ! ( He gets his cap from the chest and stands looking from one to the other . He goes up to MALLIE . ) Well , I ' spects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bout roosting time .

MALLIE ( Turning towards him in fear and speaking abstractedly ) .  --  Do n't be gwine off so early . ( She pulls at his hand . ) I hai n't mo 'n seed you . WILEY BOY Well , le 's git out o ' dese trances and ' muning wid de speerits ef I 's gwine stay heah . ( He tries to dispel the fears that have crept in around the hearth , and so he begins a rollicking railroad song . ) I wants to git a jobA-shevling down de coal , Where I kin gag de engineAnd heah de drivers roll.Hoo-la-loo  --  hoo-la-loo , Heah de drivers roll . p. 33 MALLIE ( Twisting her hands ) .  --  Do n't do dat . Le 's set and talk , and do n't go ' way and leave us . ( He crams his cap into his pocket and stands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S eyes . ) WILEY BOY ( Astonished and impatient ) .  --  Whut'n de name o ' God 's de matter , Mam ? MALLIE Ef you could only stay rat on wid us and did n't have to leave ! WILEY BOY ( Pondering a moment and then looking up and speaking nonchalantly ) .  --  Well , mebbe  --  well ,  --  ( With decision . ) I ' bout decided to gita steady job at de brickmill over de river and stay ' round where I kin sorter look adder you . MALLIE ( Uncomprehendingly ) .  --  Is you ?  --  MUH TUCK ( Bursting out ) .  --  And den we could have music at spells . MALLIE ( A great joy flooding her face ) .  --  Bless de Lawd ! At de last some o ' my trouble is gwine leave me . ( She watches him hungrily . But suddenly the harried vacant look settles over her face . ) But I du n no  --  I dunno. p. 34 WILEY BOY Whut 's dat ! Whut 's de trouble now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de crap away from Sam . He 's levied on all of it foh debts and fo'bids anybody teching it . He 's gwine har hands and pick it . ( Wringing her hands . ) I cai n't tell Sam ' bout it , I cai n't .

But you gut to leave him . MALLIE ( With a frightened movement ) .  --  I cai n't  --  I  --  ( The tears flood afresh from her eyes . ) ( There is a noise of someone 's coming up on the porch . ) MUH TUCK ( Crying out in fear ) .  --  Dat 's him , Wiley Boy . I knows his step ! ( MALLIE stands wringing her hands and crying silently as WILEY BOY gets his handbag and guitar and hurries into the kitchen . MALLIE rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left opens and SAM TUCKER enters . ) MALLIE ( Rousing the fire ) .  --  Why are you back so early , Sam ? Did  --  did everything turn out ?  --  ( MUH TUCK suddenly screams . MALLIE looks up and cries out . ) Oh !  --  ( SAM comes towards the fire . His face is bruised , his clothes torn , and he sways as he walks. ) p. 35 MUH TUCK ( Rising from her chair ) .  --  Dey 's been adder him ! Dey 's been adder him ! SAM ( Snarling at her ) .  --  Shet up yo ' damn yowling , will you ? and do n't be rousing de neighborhood . I 'm not dying yet . ( MALLIE stands a moment terror-stricken and then runs up to him . ) MALLIE You 's hurt , hurt bad , Sam . SAM ( Pushing her back ) .  --  I 'm not hurt much . No time to doctor me now . ( He stands before the fire , MUH TUCK collapses in her chair . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten and hunted . His learning drops away from him like a worn out garment . He is panting for breath . ) SAM I come to tell you to git away !  --  to  --  to leave , leave ! MALLIE ( Sobbing and burying her face in her hands ) .  --  Whut 's happened ! Whut 's happened ! MUH TUCK ( Swaying in her chair , and crying to herself ) .  --  Lawd-a-muhcy on us ! Lawd-a-muhcy ! ( For a moment SAM stands before the women silent with closed eyes . He pulls his crumpled speech from his pocket and throws it into the fire. ) p. 36 SAM I 'd ort to learnt better long ago  --  I ort to . They ai n't no chance , never has been no chance . ( He looks at the motto on the wall and repeats the words dully . ) We are rising ! ( Echoing . ) We are rising !  --  He did n't know what he said , he did n't . ( He staggers and grips the mantel and stands listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cowering women . ) Git your clothes and leave . You got to go , I tell you everything 's finished at de end . MALLIE ( Wailing ) .  --  Whut happened at de schoolhouse ? Did  --  did anybody ?  --  SAM ( Pushing his bruised hand across his forehead ) .  --  I cai n't , cai n't quite think  --  Yeh , they was a crowd of white men at de door with masks over their faces . They 'd already scared all the rest of ' em off . Said they wo n't going to be no meeting . And they give me till tomorrow to git outen the country . They threatened to kill me . You got to git away , for it 's worse'n that .  --  Oh , it is ! ( Calmly and without bitterness . ) Who you reckon set ' em on me ? Who you think it was told ' em about de trouble I been in before ? Yeh , and he made it out terribler than it was . Wiley told ' em  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  No ! no ! he was but ai n't no more !

He did though . But it do n't matter this night . I 'm laying on my last bed . And you got to leave . ( Half-screaming and tearing at the mantel . ) Now ! now , I tell you ! MALLIE ( Between her sobs ) .  --  Did you  --  who hurt you ? SAM I tell you I 've done murder , and they 're coming for me . ( MUH TUCK sits doubled up with fear , her head betwen her arms . With a sharp gasp MALLIE ceases weeping and sits strangely silent . ) MUH TUCK Muhder ! Oh , Lawd-a-muhcy . ( She mumbles and sobs into her rag . ) SAM They drove me away from the meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasps . ) Every white man 's hand agin me to de last . And Mr. Tucker come out to de road when I passed his house and begun to abuse me about the crop . Said I 'd been lazy and no good . He cussed me and said I was a evil charecter in the community . Then he struck at me , and I went blind all of a sudden and hit him with my fist . Then we fou't . ( His voice growing shrill . ) And I hit him and hit him . I beat his head in , I killed him dead , dead ! I beat on and on till all de madness went out of me and de dark was everywhere . And I left him there in the night wid his children screaming for help . They 're coming to get me . ( He holds out his bruised hands . ) His blood 's still shining on my hands .

SAM ( Turning wrathfully upon her ) .  --  Yeh , yeh , you  --  you bitch , coupling wid a white man ! ( He drops his hands helplessly . A sort of terror comes upon him . ) Oh , Lawd God ! I 'm another Cain .  --  I tell you , I-I scrushed his head in and beat on till I put out de stars wid blood . Mercy ! mercy ! ( With his hands still held before him , he stands with bowed head . After a moment he looks up and speaks calmly , almost resignedly . His dignity comes back to him . ) This is the way it was meant to be , and I 'm glad it 's ended . ( He stands with his fists to his temples , and then he flings out his arms in a wide gesture . ) Oh , but damn'em ! Do n't they know I wanted to do all for the best .

SAM looks at him without interest . ) WILEY BOY Befo ' God , Pap , I  --  I did n't mean no sech happenings . I never thought murder 'd be done . p. 39 SAM ( Eyeing him coldly ) .  --  Whose son are you ? ( More loudly . ) Whose son are you ! I mind me of a cradle in the other room there . They 'll burn it along with this house , and then there 'll be no remembrance left for disgrace . ( To the women . ) Here 's Wiley , and you can go with him . ( WILEY turns back into the kitchen and instantly runs out . His eyes are staring with fear . ) WILEY BOY ( In a throaty whisper ) .  --  Come on , Mam !

He looks back towards his mother . ) MUH TUCK Come on ! Come on ! WILEY BOY Mam , Mam , do n't stay heah ! SAM ( Raising MALLIE from her chair ) .  --  Because I 'm all tangled in things like this is no reason for you to suffer too . Go on with him . You ai n't to blame for nothing . ( He pushes her towards WILEY . But she turns and throws her arms around him , clinging silently to his breast. ) p. 40 MUH TUCK ( Pulling Wiley ) .  --  I heahs ' em . Dat 's dem coming ! ( With an anxious look at MALLIE , WILEY BOY hurries with MUH TUCK through the door and into the fields . SAM places MALLIE back in her chair and stands looking at her . Something like awe comes over him . He catches her by the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , Mallie ? What ails you , gal ! ( She sits looking dumbly at him with crazed eyes . He draws away from her in fear . There is a sound of stamping feet outside , and voices slip in like the whispering of leaves . A stone is thrown against the house , then another and another . One crashes through the window and strikes the lamp . The room is left in a semi-darkness . SAM , with a sob of overwhelming terror falls upon his knees . Twisting his great hands together , he casts up his eyes and cries out in a loud voice . ) God , God , where is you now ! Where is you , God ! ( He begins half-sobbing and chanting . ) You has helped befo ' , help me now . Is you up dere ? Heah my voice !

Ignorance means sin and sin means destruction . ( Shouting . ) Freedom ! freedom ! ( He opens the door. ) p. 42 VOICE Hell !  --  Lookout ! There he is ! SAM And guns and killings is in vain . ( He steps out on the porch . ) What we need is to  --  to  --  ( His words are cut short by a roar from several guns . He staggers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must have  --  have  --  ( At the sound of the guns , MALLIE springs to her feet . For an instant everything is still . Then several shots are fired . ) VOICE Quit the shooting . He 's dead as a damned door ! Now everybody get away from here before the word gets out .

The sound of crackling flames is heard , and a red glow begins to creep up in the rear of the room . ) ( The wind blows through the house setting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and the owl calls farther down the hollow. )
