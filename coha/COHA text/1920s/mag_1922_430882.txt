 | OUR friends in Antofagasta , on the arid coast of northern Chile , urged us to continue the journey south by sea . " So much easier than the long , dusty railroad trip , " they said . But some years before we had made the voyage , visiting the ports of this elongated country , whose amazingly diversifled shore , extending through nearly thirty-nine degrees of latitude , is exceeded in length only by Canada and Brazil . This tithe we decided to travel on the longitudinal railway , from its beginning . in the dreary desert , to its dropping-off place , on the wooded shore of the Gulf of Ancud . Few , save the Chileans thempelves , make this comprehensive journey , from the rainless region of the north to the rich agricultural heart of the country , and on through the magnificent forest and river lands , long held by the valiant Araucanian Indians , to that enchanting mountain and lake region unrivaled in beauty the world over . Still farther south , reached by coasting vessel , lies the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest-fringed fjords ; forbidding Magallanes , a network of channels and archipelagoes , with majestic glaciers slipping into a leaden sea ; and little-known Tierra del Fuego , whose unique pasture lands support two million heavily fleeced sheep , @# supplanting the dappled guanaco on the southernmost range of the world . Chile , the only South American country lying altogether west of the Andes , is 2,627 miles long . Placed east to west across the United States , its sword-like body , varying in width from Toy to 223 miles , would stretch from the Singer Building , in New York , to the City Hall , in San Francisco , and extend over 5o miles into the Pacific Ocean . Geographically it is much like our Pacific coast reversed . Alaskan fjords are paralleled in the Magallanes country . Where we have northern forests in the State of Washington , Chile is arid ; where we have southern deserts on the Mexican border , Chile is forested . The long agricultural valley of Chile , alternating between grainfields and vineyards , corresponds with the " Sunny San Joaquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the climate of the more densely inhabited portions of this southern republic is not unlike the sparkling , sundrenched atmosphere of our own Golden West . Our Antofagasta friends have a garden in the desert . My bedroom window , high up in the tower , commanded a view of the town . Walls and roofs as colorless as the sand were unrelieved by a tree or a blade of grass ; yet , just under my window , the barren soil had been touched by the magic  | wand of irrigation . Here firs and eucalyptus towered above bamboos and oleanders , and pomegranate and fig trees were heavy with fruit . In the shade of the grape arbor the breakfast table was laid . Water is brought 250 miles by pipe-line from the Bolivian : Andes . One night the Chinese gardener left the faucet open , and by morning forty dollars ' worth of the precious fluid had been consumed by the thirsty sand . MOUNTAIN PEAKS USED FOR SUN DIALS Irrigation in these lateral coastal valleys , lying between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agriculture was dependent on the streams flowing seaward from the Andes . We learned from the American consul at Tacna , in the province still in dispute between Peru and Chile , of the following ancient method still in vogue : In some of these irrigated districts sunset is the time fixed for transferring the water from one section to another but in the valley , several hundred feet below the inclosing hills , the instant of sunset occurs earlier at the western rim than in the other end of the valley . After the sun has set in the lowlands it continues for some time to illuminate the snowv slopes above , which glow with ruby light , then suddenly turn milky white and fade into darkness . To avoid controversy , the ancient Peruvians brought common sense to bear and agreed to consider it sunset at that moment when the sun ceased to illuminate the snow-clad mountain peaks . This method , known as " calculating the sky view , " is still in vogue in the province of Tacna . In Antofagasta we boarded the eastbound train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chilean longitudinal sixty miles inland on the pampa . The longitudinal 's beginning is at Pisagua , a port north of Antofagasta . Arica , still farther north in disputed territory , is not vet connected with the Chilean railroad system , being beyond the nitrate zone . Uninterrupted rail communication from north to south was finally completed eight years ago . In the 1,863 miles of track from Pisagua to Puerto Montt , on the Gulf of Ancud , three different gauges are employed . The government owns most of the road and is gradually taking over the northern section , with its many feeders , controlled by British and Belgian capital and originally built in isolated regions to bring nitrate and other minerals to the coast . It takes a drab pencil to draw for you a picture of the country crossed those first two clays out from Antofagasta . I looked in vain on the monotonous , treeless plain for so much as a cactus plant . We were too far inland to glimpse the restless , blue Pacific , whose tempestuous surf enlivens even the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleak gray hills shut off the snow-crowned Andes . This stupendous range , whose jagged peaks soar skyward , has created the barren waste by wringing all the moisture out of the trade-winds from the east . Before the Andes rose to their present height , this desert , nearly twice the length of Syria , was a tropical forest . Just to the north , in Tarapaca , numerous skeletons of gigantic ant-eaters , denizens of the jungle , have been found embedded in the sides of ravines . Chile was an altogether different country when the Andes were young . CHILE 'S CHIEF SOURCE OF REVENUE Near the railroad I saw deeply furrowed patches of white earth resembling old salt deposits . These mark the site of former nitrate workings . Nitrate of soda , Chile 's chief source of revenue , of which the country has virtually a world monopole , is obtained from the rough rock known locally as caliche . It is dug or blasted from the earth , in some places lying near the surface ; in others 20 to 30 feet below ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the coast , at an altitude varying from a little over 3,000 to 13.000 feet . Scientists disagree as to the origin of this valuable mineral . Some claim ( and Darwin among them ) that it had its origin in seaweed of an ancient period . One savant argues that the deposit resulted from nitrogen contained in guano . Others believe in its atmospheric origin , advancing the theory that in a remote age  | electricity passing through moist air , by combination , formed nitric acid ; this in turn , impregnating the flood waters of Andean streams and coming in contact with the limestone of the rocks , formed nitrate of lime : another step in Nature 's laboratory brought this nitrate of lime in contact with sulphate of soda , forming the caliche we find to-day . The nitrate fields stretch for several hundred miles along the pampas ' western rim , which marks the edge of the ancient flood waters . THE NITRATE PROCESS IS SIMPLE The process of production is simple . The loose rock is carried by mule teams . or cars suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nitrate establishments , and on to the crushing plant , where , after being broken into small pieces , it is thrown into iron vats and boiled until the dissolved saltpeter can be filtered . When crystallized it is cleaned , and the finished salitre , or nitrate of soda , packed in bags and sent to the nearest port . The greater portion now comes to the United States to enrich our soil and to be used in the manufacture of explosives . Iodine , precipitated from the nitrate solution , is the most important by-product of the caliche rock . By agreement among the nitrate establishments , its production is limited to every sixth year , that the market may not be overstocked . Operated for the most part by Chilean and British capital , 129 of these nitrate establishments , or oficinas , as they are known locally , are scattered over the pampa back of Pisagua , Iquique , and Antofagasta , their tall chimneys dominating the plain . At night , from our southbound train , the myriad twinkling lights of these strange desert towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sustenance on the world of trees and pastures beyond the far horizon . A LONG JOURNIY " JUST TO SEE RAIN " At a dreary ; sun-baked station , where one ugly galvanized-iron building broke the monotony of the plain , the khaki-clad British manager of one of the nitrate establishments boarded our train . He was going south , he said , " just to see it rain . "  | The eternal blue skies had gotten on his nerves . " The climate is trying , " he told me , " hot during the day , with afternoon duststorms , and often frost at night . " His particular settlement , with 2,000 or more inhabitants , is a little world in itself , miles from its nearest neighbor . Surrounding the plant are comfortable homes , a hotel , store , hospital , church , post-office , barracks , and a plaza , where the band plays in the evening . According to authorities , ' the explored nitrate region contains sufficient mineral to last for 240 years , at the present rate of production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or workingmen of the country , with a few Bolivians and Peruvians . Chile has always depended for labor on her own peasantry , never importing African slaves or Asiatic coolies , as have other of the Latin American countries . Alcoholism is slowly but surely sapping the vitality of the Chilean roto , long noted for his powerful physique . The Latin American of the educated class drinks temperately , regarding wine as a nourishment rather than a stimulant ; but , on my last journey , I noted a growing movement in favor of prohibition throughout Chile . among thinking people who realize the evil result of alcohol on the working classes . The second night out from Antofagasta we reached Copiapo , where we left the Valparaiso Express to travel thereafter on " local " day trains , stopping off in many Chilean towns all the way down to the Gulf of Ancud . CHILE 'S MOST HISTORIC TOWN Copiapo is Chile 's most historic town . The little stream which borders it , now nearly dry , now in full flood , was our first oasis after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . as to us , this strip of meadow land was a God-given sight . To Copiapo , in the fifteenth century , marched the Incan ruler , Tupac Yupan-  | qui , with his victorious army , to subjugate the tribes of northern Chile . The Inca 's trail from Peru led down the backbone of the snow-clad Andes and across the burning desert . In 1535 Diego de Almagro , a colleague of Pizarro , traveled the same road with a great army of Spaniards and Peruvians , horses and llamas , two Incan princes acting as guides . Old Spanish chronicles tell of the terrible suffering from cold and thirst endured by Almagro 's men on the six months ' march . The desert was strewn with their bones , Alluring were Copiapo 's meadows to those who survived ! Almagro failed to subdue the southern natives , and five years later a Spanish army was again encamped in Copiapo , led this time by Pedro de Valdivia , who kept on south to found Santiago . In the halcyon days of ' 49 , when California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great mart of the Pacific coast , supplying flour and other commodities to the California miners . My pioneer grandfather used to tell me  | of those eventful days . When he was in Chile in the early fifties , Copiapo was an important town , sharing the European opera season with Santiago and Valparaiso . Grandfather knew William Wheelwright , the American captain of industry , who in 1851 built the first railroad in South America from the port of Caldera , 50 miles inland to Copiapo . Wheelwright 's dream was of a transcontinental railway across the Andes to Tinogasta , in Argentina , and on to the Atlantic ; but the road never got far beyond Copiapo . THE ROMANTIC STORY OP GODOY , THE SILVER KING This great American also gave Chile its telegraphic system and , after failing to interest American capital in a steamship line between Valparaiso and New York , turned to England and inaugurated in the early sixties the first steamer service between the west coast and Europe . In 1832 a donkey driver , Juan Godoy , discovered a silver deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Godoy 's story reads like a romance . Tired of loading his train of donkeys with scanty brushwood for town customers , he started across the pampa to hunt the roving guanaco . Sitting on a rock to rest , he discovered that his seat was of silver . Returning home with specimens , he shared the knowledge of his discovery with an educated acquaintance , who aided the ignorant man to make the most of his find . Godoy became the Silver King of that period . It was hard for us to visualize Copiapo 's past splendor in the forlorn little town that we found . Half the buildings were still in ruins , after the disastrous earth-  | quake of the previous year . The hotel , kept by a sad-faced Englishman , had a decided tilt . Doors and windows were iammed and window-panes missing . Our host apologized for candle-light , saying that the gas-pipes were still out of commission . The stone bathtub , reached by a rickety flight of steps , had a somewhat tipsy appearance . But the Copiapinos have not lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . In this land where the extreme infrequence of showers is a hardship , they have come to believe that earthquakes are forerunners of much-needed rain . Between quakes they look to the east , watching for a heavy fall of snow in the Andes . Then the river runs full and the fields smile . From Copiapo a trail across the desert leads to the mountains , so sterile , gaunt , and forbidding ; yet there is a majesty in the Andean , contour . From our bleak , upland camp at the sunset hour , the coloring of slopes and crags was gorgeous beyond adjectives to describe . Pink deepened to rose ; rose to terra-cotta ; terra-cotta to purple . Then each towering peak became a sentinel guarding a mysterious Promised Land beyond the Andes . We passed the ruins of long-abandoned stone dwellings , occupied , perhaps , in those remote days of pre-Incan rule when these mountains had not risen to their present height and this region was within the corn belt . HOME OP THE GUANACO , VICUNA , AND CHINCHILLA We geographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising from the coastal plain , but as the most stupendous mountain system in the world , if we eon-  | sider its gradual slope from ocean bed to crowning summit . Young , as compared with other great ranges , it is still the giant among them . These heights are the home of the roving guanaco and vicuna , wild cousins of the llama and alpaca , all of cameloid stock . Here soars the mighty condor . A little to the north lies a highland plateau known as the Pampa of the Ostrich , where an occasional rhea , once so abundant on the Argentine plains , still roams . One afternoon we rode past a natural rock fortress with innumerable windows . At each opening squatted a wise little gray viscacha , gazing out over the plain . A southern naturalist told me of the remarkable habits of these strange rodents . " In Argentina , " he said , " the farmers endeavor to destroy whole colonies of viscachas by filling in the openings to  | their burrows . The task completed , the men ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will no longer be undermined . A mile or more away another viscacha colony receives , in some mysterious manner , an S. O. S. signal , and off the animals scamper to dig out their unfortunate neighbors . ' ' The fleet pampa fox and the velvety chinchilla dispute the borderland between plateau and plain . Near the railroad we passed a chinchilla farm , a new and profitable industry . The area was inclosed by a huge galvanized-iron fence sunk deep in the ground that the valuable animals night not burrow out . Cattle are driven from Argentina into Chile over the mountain passes , making the journey with their front hoofs shod . Throughout the length of Chile there are many of these Andean passes used by the natives from time immemorial . Through one of these natural defiles a railroad , now building west from Salta , in northwest Argentina , will eventually enter the Chilean nitrate desert , bringing vegetables and fruits now imported from the valleys of the south . LAND SUPERLATIVELY RICH IN MINERALS If poverty-stricken in verdure , this region is superlatively rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when the Chilean aborigines paid tribute to the Incas in gold and silver . Nitrate and copper to-day and manganese , perhaps , to-morrow guarantee the nation 's economic place in the world 's markets . Cobalt , nickel , lead , and sulphur are mined . Two rival American mining companies operate gigantic copper properties . I visited one camp , a transplanted American city with 15 , o00 inhabitants , where good old U. S. A. jazz resounded by night through the canyon . One of these properties is the largest of its kind in the world , with the possible exception of a Peruvian copper mine not yet thoroughly prospected . By the electrolytic method here employed , the purest copper is produced . We met a group of engineers and geologists , representing a Japanese syndicate , exploring Chile 's undeveloped mineral wealth . They proposed to acquire  | mines and work them on a grand scale with modern methods . Under the jurisdiction of the Department of Caldera , in which Copiapo is situated , is an isolated Chilean island , 2,000 miles west in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 1,400 miles from Pitcairn , its nearest a near-by province . A meteorological station is located on the island . With its immense stone terraces and colossal monolithic images , Easter Island is one of the threads in that tangled skein , yet to be unraveled , of prehistoric Pacific migrations . Are these South Pacific isles the top of a submerged continent ? Were they the stepping-stones of an ancient Asiatic civilization which migrated eastward to the New World , leaving its imprint on a primitive Americ people . The archeological field of northern  | Chile is merely scratched . Under the drifting sands of the vast Atacama desert lies the record of a pre-Incan race . In the Valparaiso Museum I saw a mummy recently unearthed in the Atacama region . The director told me that it differs from the mummies heretofore discovered on the west coast of South America , being more like the Egyptian type . In a collection in the Chilean capital I saw implements and pottery of this Atacama culture differing widely from archeological remains in Peru and Bolivia . Continuing south from Copiapo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass and stunted bush to tall algarobas and cacti of many varieties , one with a great red bloom . At Vallenar we entered a wide , irrigated valley , emerald green with alfalfa , and vines heavy with those luscious white grapes whose equal I have found in no other part of the world . The vine , brought originally from Spain in colonial days , is now cultivated throughout an extensive range . The French vine , popular in certain provinces ,  | was introduced in the fifties . Chilean wines are celebrated throughout Spanish America . Here the manufacture of wine is regarded as a national industry and few advocates of prohibition place light wine and beer on the black list . The chief producers market their highgrade brands with a little metal tag attached to each bottle . Each tag bears a number . The restaurant proprietor , when uncorking a bottle , keeps the tag . Every month there is a lottery , and those holding tags with the winning numbers receive cash prizes . Some proprietors turn the tag privilege over to their waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands . At the River Elqui the longitudinal railway gives a twist seaward to serve the charmingly situated town of La Serena and Coquimbo , its port . La Serena , now as tranquil as its name implies , dates back to 1544 . In its early history its calm was twice broken by English buccaneers . In visiting its old churches , I was reminded that Chile was devoid of art and industry for two centuries of colonial rule ; all church ornaments and books on sacred subjects were brought from Quito , Ecuador . As you sail down the Pacific coast , you say good-by to verdure at Guayaquil ; then follows the long stretch of desert coast through Peru and northern Chile . It is only as you near Coquimbo that green fields again greet you . For a century and a half Coquimbo has been famed as a mining center . One of our North American steel companies has developed a remarkable iron property in the gigantic Tofo mines , where ore taken from a mountain of iron by steam-shovels  | is conveyed by an electrically operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into specially constructed steamers . HOW THE CHILEANS TRAVEL From Coquimbo the railroad again strikes inland . Two locomotives urged our train up the steep grade to the cumbre , the rack system being used for some 30 miles . Our fellow-passengers on the clay train were middle-class Chileans . The elite patronize the express . In Chile , as in other of the South American countries , the middle class has gained strength since my first visit , in 1p03 . The aisle was crowded with hand-bags of huge proportions , as very little luggage can be checked free of charge . We heard much grumbling about the terrific increase in fares ? 75 per cent for passengers and 50 per cent for freight . Since then there has been still another increase . Our car was the average clay coach that one sees in the " States " ? a little cleaner , perhaps . A placard on the wall gave the date when the car was last disinfected . Each family carried an enormous lunchbasket , well stocked with cold meats , chicken , bread , fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-car , used only at meal time in our country , is filled all day long in Chile , the tables being utilized for cards and dominoes . Smoking is permitted in the diner , as well as in the coaches . Our train carried no second-class coach . In the third class were four benches running the length of the car . " Red caps " to carry luggage and uniformed armed guards for police duty were in evidence at the stations . We entered a mountainous region where graceful palms covered the hillsides . This is the palm from which the famous mid de palmy ( honey of the palm ) is obtained . The tree is not tapped , as in the production of maple sugar , but is felled . The sap obtained is converted into a syrup , in great demand to serve with hot cakes , here known as " panqueques . " Featured also on the menu we find two other old acquaintances ? ' cau-ktailes " and " beefteackes . " It takes six days of daylight travel from Antofagasta to Calera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , connecting the town of Los Andes , at the foot of the mountains , with Valparaiso . The Aconcagua Valley is Chile 's gem , a lovely vale where a merry little river , dashing down from crystalline heights , is bordered by velvety green hills . We are now in the rich agricultural region which stretches far south to the Bio-Bio River . This and adjoining valleys , the geologists tell us , are the remains of ancient fjords like those we still see in far southern Chile . In ages long past , all this country was a maze of fjords and archipelagoes . In the Tertiary period the Sequoia , mammoth of the plant world , to-day represented only by our " Big Trees " of California , grew on these Andean slopes . Where the coast range of the Andes dips its feet in the sea Valparaiso , South America 's chief port on the Pacific , rises like an amphitheater from the crescent shore . To me this city has never seemed typically South American or even distinctly Chilean . There are so many Britishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in common with British colonial ports . Cochrane and O'Higgins , Simpson and O'Brien , are a few of the many British names in Chile 's Hall of Immortals . Ever since the war of independence , men of their blood have here played star roles . In the late World War thousands of men of British blood left South America to serve in His - Majesty 's forces . ELEVATORS CONNECT THE STREETS OF VALPARAISO Like Hongkong , Valparaiso is formed of a few level streets on land in part reclaimed from the sea , and a residential section on the hills above . Elevators on inclined planes , known locally as " ascensors , " connect the streets by the shore with those on the heights . These lifts are the first objects in the port to claim the traveler 's attention and the ones that dwell longest in his memory . They are operated in the open , all , clay long and far into the night , lifting and lowering thousands . The view from one of these nearly perpendicular inclines , of  | town , harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful view from the peak above Hongkong . VALPARAISO IS WAGING A WINNING BATTLE WITH THE SEA The harbor of Valparaiso is called a hay by courtesy . It is almost an open roadstead . The traveler is impressed with the stupendous work , still in progress , for protecting the shore from the terrific inroads of the sea . At the season of tern ' , orals the surf dashes in with relentless fury , tearing down the massive masonry of the seawall and devastating the waterfront ; but bulwarking against the enemy goes on untiringly and in time the port will win . A norther sweeping in is a mighty spectacle to behold . I prefer to watch it from the shore . ' We 've slipped from Valparaiso , With the Norther at our heels . Well do I remember it ! It was just at the beginning of one of these storms . The passage from shore to ship was made in a rowboat . A mountain of undulating water towered on either side of our frail craft , and only miraculously , on the crest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp and drenched , on the heaving ship 's deck . The ship could not hold anchor , and it was with a prayer of thanksgiving that we beat toward the south . I am often asked what interested me most in Chile . Were I a materialist , I might say " the food . " In no other part of the globe is food at the leading restaurants better than in the south temperate cities of Valparaiso , Santiago , Buenos Aires , and Montevideo . Valparaiso 's market is stocked with excellent meat ? beef from Argentina , fattened in Chile ; veal from Tierra del Fuego : sea food from cold southern waters ; fresh-water fish from snow-fed streams ; dairy products from the southern German colony ; vegetables from central Chilean valleys . With tropical fruit from Ecuador , native wine of the best quality , delicious sweets in the form of fruit and sugar paste , augmented by almost any imported delicacy you may desire , I dare not recommend certain of these restaurants to friends of increasing girth . Chilean sea food , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from beds off the island of Chiloe and lobsters , of unusual size , from the islands of Juan Fernandez . ROBINSON CRUSOE 'S ISLE FAMOUS FOR ITS LOBSTERS Mas-a-Tierra , the largest of the Juan Fernandez group of three islands , lying 36o miles southwest of Valparaiso , is Robinson Crusoe 's isle . It was here , in 1704 , that Alexander Selkirk , a Scottish  | sailor , was dropped ashore from an English galley at his own request . If we are to believe his biographers , it was a clear case of " Mr. Captain , stop the ship : I , want to get off and walk . " Selkirk had dreamed of shipwreck and yearned for terra firma . Defoe , in writing his famous story , made the West Indian island of Tobago the setting for his hero 's adventures , instead of the Chilean island , where Selkirk lived for more than four years . Besides Selkirk and the lobsters-of-renown . Juan Fernandez has its unique chonta palms , now becoming rare , and other semi-tropic flora . Before the axe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a forest of sandalwood , far removed from its native habitat . Valparaiso must have been lively in 1849 , when my pioneer forefathers were trailing to California across the plains and round the Horn . It was then the emporium of trade with the newly opened gold-fields and a free port , where ships could bring in goods to be held in bond , paying only a small duty on transshipment . The bread of the California miners was made from Chilean flour . The situation of Santiago , Chile 's capital , nearly I , Soo feet above the sea , is most attractive , ranking in beauty among South American cities second only after Rio de Janeiro and mating La Paz , Arequipa , and Caracas . SANTIAGO 'S SUBLIME PANORAMA Come with me at the sunset hour to the summit of Santa Lucia , that singular hill of volcanic origin in the heart of the city , where Pedro de Valdivia , the real conquerer of Chile , built his first defense against the natives . This once barren knoll , 400 feet above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over its tree-tops we look down on the great city of half a million souls ? a city of low buildings and checker-board streets set in emerald meadows and encompassed by snowy mountains . Only at our own Mount Rainier have I seen flower-spangled fields and snow-draped crests in such close proximity . Now , as the sun sets , the jagged Andean peaks , towering above purpling slopes , are aflame . It is a sublime panorama .  | In this part of Chile are many mountains whose summits can be won by Alpine enthusiasts . The view of green fields , blue ocean , and surrounding ranges from one of these crests is worth the most strenuous climb . Californian poppies blowing in the breeze , Arching blue of heavens , curving blue of seas , Line on line of mountains , rising crest on crest , Steeped in golden sunshine , Chile at its best . Mount Aconcagua , the highest peak in the Americas , just across the line in Argentina , wears its eternal snowhelmet . Aviators crossing the Andes fly past the volcano Tupungato . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - men and one bird-woman have successfully dared the Transandine flight . Five were Chilean. two French , one Argentine , one Italian . There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts and two of the aviators lost their lives . Since this is the story of my journey through Chile from tip to tip , we can not linger in the capital , but again at Santiago , once south on the longitudinal . We are now in the long agricultural valley between the Coast Range and the Andes . Wheat-fields and vineyards border the track . Stately rows of Lombardy poplars and eucalyptus inclose the fields . At the stations are female fruit-sellers uniformed in white . They have melons for sale ? big yellow melons ? which , like the grapes , take first rank . Last year a consignment of Chilean fruit ? melons , peaches , apples , and grapes ? arrived in the port of New York . Some of the melons , weighing seventeen pounds , sold for six dollars each . At the same time , Chile was importing oranges and lemons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have long been a product of Chile . We pass Rancagua , a famous battleground in the war of independence , to-day the junction with a branch railway leading to a big North American copper property high up in the mountains . Now come the industrial towns of Talca and Chillan , with many one-story buildings .  | Industrial growth is slow but certain . Besides possessing raw material for manufacturing , Chile has unlimited water-power in the Andes for hydro-electric development . THE CHILEAN COWBOY 'S GAME OF " TOPIO " From Chillan we drove to a neighboring village to watch the country-folk at play . The Chilean cowboy is less picturesque than his fellow on the other side of the Andes , the Argentine gaucho . His trousers are not as baggy and he is not as gaily bedecked with silver trappings . He is known as the huaso , which means " countryman , " while the little country maid is the huasita . He is a splendid horseman , and his steed is high-spirited , with an Arab strain . His favorite sport is shared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topio . In front of a farmhouse , under the shade trees , were large , solidly built uprights with cross - bars . These elongated hitching-posts play an important role in topio . The horsemen pair by lot and " line up " in front of the bar . One of the riders presses his horse forward against the bar , crossing and imprisoning the head of his opponent 's mount . At the referee 's call the game is on , and the rider of the imprisoned horse endeavors to free him . The horses are as highly trained as our polo ponies , and , when matched with skillful riders , a single struggle may last an hour . In the preliminaries a dozen such contests are simultaneous , with short rests be-  | tween . A day is often consumed in determining the final victor . There is no more exciting sport for riders , horses , and spectators than a good topio match . The Chileans have never cared for bull-fights or cock-fights , favorite sports with others of Spanish blood . Among transplanted sports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and polo . but is not enthusiastic over golf or baseball . The national dance , the caeca , once popular throughout the country , is still in vogue in many of the villages . We sped southward through the irrigated bottom lands of central Chile , with their refreshing alfalfa fields , their browsing cattle . It is a country of large estates , where the roto toils for the master ? the ancient feudal system . CON CEPCION , CHII , Z 'S THIRD CITY . Few foreigners stop between Santiago and Concepcion , a day or a night journey on the express . Concepcion , Chile 's third city in importance , is , on the north shore of the Bio-Bio River , not far from the sea . The Bio-Bio , the largest river on the west coast of South America , was long the dividing line between civilized Spanish Chile and the territory of the indomitable Araucanian Indians , who for more than three centuries defied their country 's invaders . As a frontier post and the seat of innumerable earthquakes , Concepcion has known turbulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talcahuano , with the best harbor in southern Chile . It is the seat of the whaling industry , whales being found nearer the shore here than in most parts of the world . Southward lie the ports of Coronel and Lota , where vast coal mines extend under the sea . Although Chile is the principal coal-producing country of South America , with an estimated coal reserve of two billion tons , only one and a half million tons were produced last season , great quantities of coal being imported from the United States , Great Britain and Australia and fuel oil from Mexico . When we crossed the Bio-Bio River we entered that romantic territory known to the Chileans as the Frontera . Within the memory of the living , white men might not enter this region of great forests and noble rivers . It was the domain of the Araucanians . We dropped off in Temuco , to study and photograph this once strongest and most valorous of all South American tribes , for centuries unconquered by Inca , Spaniard , or Chilean . It was left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid resistance . Nowadays the Indians and Chilean peons can not get their drink too strong . They mix the native ail , a very hot pepper , with crude brandy to give it sufficient " pep . " There are about 100,000 Araucanian , ' left in southern Chile . They call themselves Mapuche , which means " people of the country . " They live in no particular place , being scattered through the forest from the ocean to the Andes ; but there are more of them around the town of Temuco than in any other section . Here they farm on a small scale , raising wheat , corn , potatoes , and apples ; some raise cattle . In the mountains to the east they raise cattle and sheep . Formerly these Indians had a much wider range , extending across the Andes toward the Atlantic . Some of their relatives , now differing widely in customs , still live on the Argentine side of the mountains . The Incas of Peru failed to subjugate these people and gave them the name of Araucanians , derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestiges of Peruvian culture somehow drifted down to them . From the Incas they learned the art of weaving , and woolen blankets replaced the old guanaco-skin garments . The guanaco , now found on the Patagonian plains east of the Andes , still strays occasionally , through some lowlying mountain pass , into Chilean territory . The black and white designs on modern Mapuche ponchos remind me of certain ancient Central American designs . The mass of silver ornaments still worn by Mapuche women show Incan influence ? the silk er figures of llamas and the silver pin , , fastening the blanket across the woman 's breast ( the tupu of the Incas ) .  | The cross , featured in Mapuche ornaments , erected over graves , and painted on the faces of warriors during festivals , is not , curiously enough , the Christian cross introduced by the Spaniards . It is the eight-pointed Maltese cross and antedates the European invasion . COSTUMES AND CUSTOMS OE THE MAPUCHE Incan influence can also be noted in certain Mapuche words . A species of seaweed , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the Incas it was cocha yuyu , " garden truck of the sea . " I compiled quite a list of these Incan-Mapuche words . The women cling to the old type of costume ? the black or deep indigo-blue belted blanket gown , pinned over the shoulders . They wear their abundant black hair in two long queues , wrapping a cloth about the head , turban-fashion . Their enormous silver ear-pendants and massive necklaces give them a bizarre appearance . The barbarous fashion of plucking the eyebrows , popular of late in the United States , has long been practiced by Mapuche belles.  | The men have forsaken native dress save back in the mountains , where a few still cling to the chirapa , or bloomers , evolved from a blanket wrapped round the legs and tucked through the belt , the same type of trousers formerly worn by the Argentine gaucho . Mapuche customs , slowly dying out , are interesting . There is the hair-pulling contest among the boys . Standing face to face , each combatant grasps the long locks of his opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy your opponent 's balance and bring him to the ground . Once down , there is no pommeling . The hold is loosened and the boys stand up and begin again . Chueca , the national Mapuche ball-game , played with clubs , is not unlike hockey . Certain names among Christianized Mapuches and Chileans puzzle the traveler until he learns that , regardless of sex , a child is often named after the saint upon whose day it happens to be born . Thus a man may be called " Maria " and a woman " Pabla. "  | Some of the Mapuche girls I met had names half Christian , half pagan , like little Maria Epuqui , who went to all the trouble of changing her gown on the sidewalk to have her picture taken . Her best clothes and shoes were in a bundle under her arm . There are Catholic and Protestant missions among these Indians . The'British missionary , who has lived here for twenty years , rides back into the wilderness and camps with his flock . " They are eager to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with the Chileans and retain their allotted lands . " ARAUCANIAN BLOOD IN CHILEAN VEINS The tragic history of this valiant forest tribe is told in " La Araucana , " that epic of Ercilla 's , the Spanish warriorpoet , who met these Indians on the battlefield in sixteenth-century wars . His mighty heroes , Caupolican and Lautaro. were real men . The one was put to  | death by the Spaniards ; the other caused the death of the Spanish conqueror , Pedro de Valdivia . In the blood of the southern Chileans , save among a few aristocratic Spanish families , flows the strain of conqueror and conquered . The great round eyes of Chilean children , the features of the universally beautiful women , show Mapuche l Mood . As a pure-blooded stock , these Indians are doomed ; but here there will be absorption rather than annihilation , and the splendid physique and valorous traits of this native people will not be lost to posterity . In Hopi-Land , in Arizona , the Indians hold their annual prayer festival for rain . In MIapuche-Land they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray for dry weather . The season of our visit there had been scarcely two consecutive rainless lays . We were under the weeping skies of Arauco . In northern Chile they long for rain ; in southern Chile , for sunshine . In the nitrate zone the total rainfall during the past twenty years has barely totaled one inch . For fourteen years not a drop fell . In Copiapo , 50o miles from the beginning of the Chilean desert , there is an average annual fall of three-quarters of an inch . But if the north has " gone dry , " the south is certainly wet . Here Jupiter Pluvius reigns . Vapor-laden winds from the Pacific meet winter-chilled earth . The winds , ascending the Andes . pass through Nature 's wringer and are hurled back in torrents . Annual precipitation must be gauged in feet instead of inches . Sixteen feet , even eighteen feet , farther south , is the official record . Our winter is the Chilean summer . If you plan a visit to rainiest Chile , go in December or January . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REPLACE RUBBERS Saddle travel is popular . Ox-teams drag carts over the muddiest of roads . The carts have wooden wheels , like the chariots of the Romans , and their creaking is heard from afar . In more settled regions , corduroy roads have been con-  | structed ; but the roads on the frontier are so bad for many months of the year that an American friend of mine , whose husband has a cattle ranch and lumber camp in the mountains , is actually marooned during the long wet season . Because of the mud , people south of the Bio-Bio wear wooden clogs over their boots , as we wear rubbers . But rain or no rain , mud or no mud , the traveler who fails to visit southern Chile misses one of the New World wonderlands . There is an almost continuous forest from the Bio-Bio to the " jumpingoff place " at Puerto Montt . In this forest are many lakes and clear grass-bordered rivers . Lumbering is the important industry . Sawed timber is piled high at the railroad stations . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for currency in the southern ports . The Indians brought  | them out on their backs from the depths of the dripping forest . Of Chilean trees , I like best the Araucaria pine , with its tall , branchless trunk and umbrella-like top . It has a relative in Brazil and Paraguay . The Mapuches gather the seeds from its cones . " Why do you import so much Douglas fir from America , when you have such splendid forests ? " I asked a Chilean fellow-traveler . He launched into a discourse on the wonders of the Chilean forest . " We do produce lumber , " he said , " lots of it , almost half of what is used in the country . That pile we just passed was lingue , ' used for furniture . Those gigantic pines are alerce . ' Some grow 120 feet high and 15 feet in diameter . It 's about the largest pine in the Americas ! . . . That big tree is the coihue .

It is the bell-shaped bloom of a vine which festoons the trees ?  | red-rose , rose , pink , and white in color . Boys and girls gather great armfuls of these lovely flowers and sell them at the railroad stations . THE LAND OP WILD BERRIES This is the land of wild berries . Here the strawberry is native . In 1715 a Frenchman carried the first Chilean strawberries to Marseilles and cultivation in Europe began . Later this berry , superior to our variety , was brought to the United States . Blackberries grow so luxuriantly that they are considered a pest . " You brought them to us from North America , " a Chilean acquaintance told me , " but we 'll have to forgive you , because you gave us , also , the California quail . " I had not expected to find quail here , or flocks of shimmering parrots , so far south . Back in the woodland depths hides the mysterious hucinul , the shy , minutive Chilean deer .

The first of these colonists , eight families in all , arrived in the port of Valdivia in 1846 . There are now about 30 , - 000 people of German stock in the country , mostly between Valdivia and Puerto Montt . The towns of La Union and Osorno show marked German influence , while Puerto Varas , on the shore of lovely Lake Llanquihue , is a typical Teuton village . I passed many groups of tow-headed school-children with knapsacks on their backs . These people have greater solidarity than any other foreign racial group . Their Chileanization seems to consist of learning Spanish and wearing the poncho in place of the mackintosh . Their children are taught to revere the fatherland . As dairymen , fruit-growers , and lumbermen , these colonists are most successful . Almost every family takes summer boarders . Each place has its waddling geese , its cool , trellised beer-garden . The Krupp concession in southern Chile , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession , granted two individuals on behalf of the Krupp Company , gave them the right for 30 years ? the lease renewable at the expiration of that time ? to 346,000 acres of forest land , with underlying coal-beds . A branch of the Krupp iron and steel industry was to have been established . Previous waterPhotograph by Harriet Chalmers Adams SELLING CHILE 'S NATIONAL PLOWER The copihue is the bell-shaped bloom of a vine which festoons the southern woods ? red-rose , rose , pink , and white in color . A famous horticulturist has said : " All in all , the copihue is the most beautiful flower which the earth has produced . " The Bureau of Plant Industry , U. S. Department of Agriculture , is now raising the copihue , and before many years this lovely flower will be known throughout the country .  | rights granted Chileans , and other legal knots , seem to have blighted the scheme . IN THE NEW WORLD SWITZERLAND At Puerto Varas we left the railway for a side trip , via the lake route , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever visited . The Chileans call it the New World Switzerland . There is a chain of four lakes , two on either side of the continental divide , with wooded stretches between . The first lake , Llanquihue ( a Mapuche name ) , is an ultra-marine sheet of water , with forest - encircled shores . F r o m Puerto Varas we steamed across the lake toward Mount Osorno . Osorno is one of the noblest mountains in the entire Andean range ? isolated , conical , snowdraped , not unlike Nippon 's sacred Fuji . The journey from Lake Llanquihue to the second lake , Todos los Santos ( All Saints ) , is made by automobile during the summer ; by coach when the roads are very muddy . We made it in the saddle , always our favorite mode of transportation , through enchanting woods , now rich in nuts and wild berries , across grassy flower-strewn fields , beside the merry little Petrohue River . Lake Todos los Santos is just at Mount Osorno 's feet , emerald green , with heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several hours brought us , at the end of the first day 's journey , to the Swiss inn at Peulla . The second day 's journey is over the Andean pass , here only 3,445 feet above sea-level , to little Lake Frias , in Argentina , and on to big Lake Nahuel-Huapi . From the town of San Carlos de Bariloche , on the shore of the last-named lake , the journey can be continued by automobile and rail to Buenos Aires . Many Argentines and Chileans cross the continent by this route in the summer time . The Argentine lake region has already been made a national park , and in time the Chilean side will be improved with metaled highways , so that automobiles may be used all the year round . No other transcontinental route south of Peru can boast of such magnificent scenery . Returning to Puerto Varas , we continued on to Puerto Montt , on the Gulf of Ancud , where the longitudinal railway @# ends . The only Chilean railroads south of this point are the line which connects the towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a privately owned stretch of rail near Punta Arenas . ANCUD SEAT OP A SHELL-FISH INDUSTRY Backed by evergreen hills , facing a crescent shore , lies the pretty little town of Puerto Montt , a busy port of southern Chile . From here steamers sail through the inland passage , that maze of archipelagoes , to the Strait of Magellan and  | into the innumerable fjords that here cleave the ragged mainland . We boarded a decidedly ill-kept little boat bound for Ancud , on the Island of Chiloe . Ancud , a galvanized-iron town fairly reeking of the sea , is the seat of the shellfish industry . Here clams , mussels , and shrimps are canned for export and oysters-in-the-shell shipped to Valparaiso . Wheat and fruit do not thrive in this moist climate , but potatoes form an important article of export , 200,000 sacks being shipped the season of our visit . I found Chiloe 's autumn climate very damp . Here I ate my first supper of cooked seaweed , which is not unpalatable . I was interested in the little Chilote pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having here developed a peculiar equine type . CHILE 'S UNEXPLORED REGIONS It is five hours by rail from Ancud to Castro , the last Chilean town of any importance until Punta Arenas is reached . The unexplored portion of Chile lies along the Andean range , in the provinces of Llanquihue and Magallanes . In 1783 a Spanish priest , Fray Francisco Menendez , explored and mapped a great portion of the wild region east and southeast of the Island of Chiloe . His long-neglected diary was some years ago published in Chile , and modern explorers found they had followed the intrepid friar 's centuryold trail . I have a copy of this fascinating diary . Last year an Argentine expedition , accompanied by several eminent Chilean scientists , explored the unknown region lying between latitudes 46 ? and 47 ? . An exhaustive study was made of glaciers and flora on the Isthmus of Ofqui . Lake Buenos Aires , one of a long chain of lakes on this southern borderland , surpasses in size all other South American lakes save Titicaca . The Chilean Government is considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will save steamers @#  | bound along the inland waterway from navigating the open sea . South of Taitao the scenery changes . The islands terminate in abrupt cliffs and glaciers come to the sea . Even at this great distance from the Equator , the trees are evergreen and the temperature rarely falls below zero . AT THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN We came , at last , in our voyaging to that winding , river-like channel , that cleft in the Andes which the great Portuguese navigator , in the service of Spain , discovered in 1520 . To the north lay the South American mainland to the south the Fuegian archipelago . I see still those majestic cliffs shading from gray into violet ; those mysterious glaciers slipping into a leaden sea ; those stormpetrels winging their way overhead ! These western reaches of the Strait of Magellan are treacherous . The Pacific is misnamed . Mariners usually find a gale off Cape Pilar . Punta Arenas has been the goal of many a missing ship . If you will consult the map ( see page 223 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the islands south of the Strait belong to Chile . The largest island of the group is divided between Chile and Argentina . The Chilean city of Punta Arenas , on the mainland facing the Strait , is the metropolis of this region ; but the Argentine town of Ushuaia , in Tierra del Fuego , is the southernmost permanent settlement in the world . From Cape Pilar to Punta Arenas we looked on a virgin country-huge masses of rock , a land suited neither to agriculturist nor shepherd ; but from Punta Arenas on to the Chilean boundary , both sides of the Strait are well adapted to agriculture . For its population , which is about 24,000 , Punta Arenas is the most commercially successful of all Chilean cities . It owes its recent prosperity to the growth of the sheep industry . Exports to the  | United States last season totaled $12,000 , - 000 . There was also a considerable export of frozen mutton to Great Britain . The earliest navigators passed this point , and Sarmiento 's band , settling here in the sixteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Famine the Chilean flag was planted in 1843 . Yankee sailors and whalers dubbed the forlorn penal colony " Sandy Point " ( Punta Arenas ) , and the name survived . In the sixties the first steamship line between Valparaiso and Liverpool was inaugurated , and Punta Arenas , the most isolated port in South America , came into importance . It is ' , Too miles from Bahia Blanca , the nearest big port on the Atlantic , and 1,200 miles from Talcahuano , on the west coast . At the time of our first visit , in 1904 , Punta Arenas was an unpretentious little town of galvanizediron roofs . I was struck with the total lack of verdure ; the terrific wind-with-an-evil-twist , which threatened to blow one across the Strait , right on down to Cape Horn . Whenever the bell at the end of the long pier tolled , there was great excitement . It heralded the coming of a steamer . Out rushed the cosmopolitan inhabitants of this " tail-end " city , eager for news from home . Telegraph and wireless finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impassable tracts of uncultivated country , in touch with the rest of Chile . The Panama Canal struck Punta Arenas a hard blow . Trade was diverted . But , in spite of its waning importance as a port of call , the city continued to thrive . AN IMPORTANT FUR MARKET Turning its eyes from sea to earth , it grew to value its surrounding grazing lands . Sheep ranches multiplied . Motor roads stretched out toward the Argentine pampa ; a steadily increasing fleet of small vessels sailed into the Fuegian channels .  | The metropolis of Magallanes has taken on a pleasing , prosperous air . This has long been an important fur market . Guanaco skins , pampa fox , cordillera wolf , white hare from the icefields , and muskrat are on sale . Belgian hares , introduced in recent years , have become such a pest that the government has placed a bounty on their heads . In the old days seals , sea-lions , and otters were unmercifully hunted , the seal rookeries to the south eventually being destroyed . The seals used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm Fuegian beaches . The most characteristic animal of the region , the guanaco , is now freed from the fear of the Indian-with-his-arrow , the enemy he has survived ; but there is still the sheep ranger 's shotgun . It is a pity that this animal has not been domesticated as was its cousin , the llama . Herds of several hundreds of these graceful , ruddy , dappled creatures may still be seen occasionally in the interior of Tierra del Fuego . Wild cattle , descended from those introduced by early settlers , are found in the mountains . In the eighties there was a rush of miners to this part of the world . The prospector bought a boat instead of a burro and headed into the labyrinth of canals south of the Strait . Gold was to be found in the black beach sands beneath the frowning precipices and in the river beds . The gold fever now has passed , but dredges are still at work . Some of the disappointed miners took to sheepfarming . One of the largest sheep-farming companies in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last four years amounting to $14,000,000 . There are five canning and freezing plants in this territory . Most of the Chilean sheep-ranges are on the Island of Tierra del Fuego , where the cold climate makes for firm flesh and thick fleece . Were we to marshal the Chilean sheep in one straight line , it  | would just about stretch from New York to San Francisco . Besides its sheep-farms and placer mines , Chilean Fuego has its coal deposits , of a rather poor quality , and an abundance of peat which can be used for fuel . Its lakes are all salty , some so rich in pure salt that the deposit is taken out by the spadeful and shipped to Punta Arenas for table use . When these islands , the tops of a submerged mountain range , rose from the sea the salt water remaining in the hollows formed lakes . The wind here reaches a terrible velocity , being at its worst in the spring ( our autumn ) . Fuego is approximately 1,000 miles farther south than Cape Town , in Africa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , gloomy , dripping forest , on the whole , yet the haunt of innumerable beautiful birds . I can not here name them all . The albatross , penguin , pelican , cormorant , and their like seem at home here ; but I had not expected to find a woodpecker ( Ipocrantor magellanicus ) and a thrush ( Turdus magcllanicus ) peculiar to this region , or one of the parrot family so far south . Great flocks of gorgeous flamingoes arrive from the north , followed by their inseparable companions , the white , blackthroated swans . When startled , the flamingoes whirl aloft in a scarlet chain , forming a perfect triangle in the azure sky , and the devoted swans follow . An occasional sight is that of a number of tall wading birds , their legs imprisoned by the freezing of a lake , released only with the midday thaw . A BLOODY PAGE IN CHILE 'S HISTORY In 1904 we still were able to find some of the original Fuegians . The Alacalufs , canoe Indians , used to inhabit the western reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Onas were to me the most interesting of the three groups . During the last years of the nineteenth century and the first fifteen years of this century these Fuegians steadily decreased and are now practically exterminated . It is a bloody page in Chile 's history . I am glad that I went there in time to see a little of the Onas , hunters and , fishermen of no mean ability , with round , smiling , Mongoloid faces , elaborately painted , their hair bobbed . They wore fur caps and guanaco-skin garments , fur side in . Poor souls ! They got as far south as the continent permitted , but even then the white man crowded them off ! Cape Horn , on Horn Island , is Chilean , the tip end of South America . The cape , rising about 1,400 feet above the sea , withstands the pounding of the tempestuous surf . Only about one-third of the days of the year here are free from rain or clouds . Few voyagers see the cape , since ships steer a course well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers , reaching the sea , slowly break off and form icebergs which float toward Antarctic waters . It is , in truth , the dropping-off place of the Andes . CROSSING TILE ANDES IN WINTER We have made three visits to southern Chile . On the last journey , instead of sailing around into the Atlantic , we returned to Valparaiso and crossed the Andes via the Transandine Railroad to Argentina . It was not , however , an uneventful journey in a Pullman coach , in the season when this trip of 888 miles can be made , very comfortably , in 48 hours . Winter had set in . Avalanches in the mountains had blocked the road . After many fruitless trips to Los Andes , at the foot of the Cordillera , we at last joined a party of restless pilgrims determined to cross the Andes that very month aboard a valiant mule . We lived to tell the tale . Two long clays there were of it between the rail heads on either side of the mountains ; two days of scaling icy ledges , plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old summer wagon-road , past the Christ of the Andes , in the Pass of Uspallata , but through the two-mile railroad tunnel , 10,000 feet above the sea , which connects the sister republics . Chile we left with its snowfields glistening in the sunlight ; Argentina we entered in a wild snowstorm . That long , silent ride through a damp , inky , inner world left a deep impression , a feeling of awe of those stupendous heights , those mighty mountains we had followed throughout the length of Chile .
