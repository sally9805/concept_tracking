txt The strongest army in Europe is massed at Germany 's gates eager to leap forward upon the Ruhr . That is the solid fact amid the doubts and anxieties , intrigues and negotiations , misunderstandings and jealousies of the present situation . After the single-minded purpose of the French military headquarters at Dtisseldorf the political atmosphere at Paris is like a fog compared with sunlight . The views of a French officer of high rank who is a , diplomat as well as a soldier , a competent judge of the tangled affairs of Europe without being hampered or influenced by considerations of internal or external politics , a man of action taught by the precept and example of Koch as by the grim practice of war that Indecision is the most dangerous of failings , as set forth to the correspondent in many different conversations during the last ten days , are materially as follows : It is a question for France of life or death to obtain from Germany execution of the financial and disarmament clauses of the Versailles Treaty . More even than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bankruptcy , is the necessary breakdown of the military machine which Germany secretly has reconstructed to repeat the revenge of 1812-14 . Already the Germans dare to boast that they will be able to crush France if she is deserted by the powers that aided her in the war . Already the weight of individual interests has created a breach between France and her allies . America stands aloof , her policy uncertain . Italy and England are trying for commercial reasons to check French 1:011Cy in Westphalia and Silesia . To them German recovery would be advantageous ; to France , a prosperous Germany at best would mean no more than a cheap shop , at worst a terrific menace . Therefore France can not and must not allow herself to be checked . Like her allies , she must consult her own interests first . To Lloyd George 's support of Germany in the matter of Upper Silesia , she must reply with the frank warning that the use of German troops against the Poles would ' have the immediate consequence of the advance of the French Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ruhr for herself in order to procure cheaply coal and steel for which her allies made her pay so dearly , but to encircle it with her troops as a Pledge in pawn to insure German obedience in paying and disarming . Today France is strong enough to act alone . Let her immediately tell the world that she will not hesitate to do . so if her allies continue to follow the present course . These views were corroborated in a lone talk today with one of the leading French publicists , a man whose moderation and sagacity are as great as his inelligenee . He said : " Not alone is the French Army beAnd its leaders in thinking like this , nit the whole nation also . Though France has cause enough , God knows , to tate soldiering apd war , you have seen ter peasants leave the fields in the tpring to join the colors without a aurmur .

They do not regard it in terms of ultimate world trade  --  they do n't think in those terms at all  --  but as a signed agreement apportioning to them certain things , like a bond between man and man . For the law of France . more than that , say , of England or America , is based upon Roman law , which furthermore Is the base of international law .

She refuses to be turned aside by abstruse arguments of economists , financiers or business men . Perhaps our view is wrong in the modern world . That does not alter the fact that it is the view we hold and will continue to hold and try to enforce . " It have said , in all sincerity , that I do n't believe there is any imperialism or militarism in France today . But I warn you that if France 's allies persist in ignoring our view or trying to impose their own upon us there is grave danger that a sentiment of aggressive nationalism will be created here . Already our people feel that they are being misunderstood by their allies . If that feeling sinnild suddenly be intensified there may be an outburst of popular anger whose consequences would be incalculable. "                  @ @ @
