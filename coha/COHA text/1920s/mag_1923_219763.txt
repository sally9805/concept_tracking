Irvin S. Cobb , whose side-splitting after-dinner stories have for over a year helped to carry the advertising in some hundreds of newspapers , has apparently made an even more lucrative strike . He is writing advertisements signed by himself . Notable this week was his full-page panegyric of " Jack Tar Togs " in the Saturday Evening Post . <P> The Jack Tar apparel is sold by the Strouse-Baer Co. of Baltimore . They have double-stitched seams and re-inforcements at the strain points . They cost $3.95 . The ad is illustrated by Tony Sarg . On either side of the display appear the faces of Cobb and Sarg , smirking knowingly.
