In a room in the Ministry of War at Bucharest , capital of Rumania , M. Manoilescu , onetime Under-Secretary of Finance , was last week put on trial before a court martial , charged with conspiracy against the throne . Earlier in the month ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) , M. Manoilescu was arrested while in possession of letters from former Crown Prince Carol to various political leaders in Rumania , including Prime Minister Jan Bratiano . <P> Colonel Vladiscu presided , as usual , over the military court , being assisted by two majors and two captains . A heavy cordon of troops was thrown around the War Office , armed sentries challenging all seekers of admission to the courtroom . Only the witnesses , lawyers and newspaper reporters were allowed in . <P> Counsel for the defense of M. Manoilescu numbered 110 . At their head were Rumania 's famed lawyer Dr. Pompiliu Joanitescu and onetime Prime Minister ( 1920-22 ; 1926-27 ) and General Alexandru Averescu . Thirty-seven witnesses were scheduled to appear , among them being Prime Minister Bratiano and former Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be allowed to return to Rumania , from which he is exiled , only if his presence were vitally necessary to ensure fairness in the trial . Meantime , the court would accept his written evidence . <P> Although Rumania is still under a censorship cloud , it being a punishable offense to mention Prince Carol 's name , either orally or in writing ( the newspapers overcome the difficulty by leaving blank spaces for his name ) , the court took no objection to it , speakers on both sides referring to him as Prince Carol of Hohenzollern . <P> The trial began with an unsuccessful attempt by the defense to prove the incompetency of the court . It was urged that the country was not legally under martial law , it being unconstitutional to keep it in a state of siege when there was no danger of foreign invasion , and that , therefore , the trial should go to a civil court before a jury . M. Carapancea , military prosecuting attorney , pleaded the contrary case , and the court came to the conclusion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Laughing , gay , eloquent , M. Manoilescu appeared before his judges to astound them with the news that Prince Carol sought not the throne but only a place in the Regency council . Said he : " The Prince is too loyal and decent to think of dethroning his own son . " <P> Then with a dramatic daring that astounded even his own corps of lawyers , he fiercely attacked the present regime . Cried he : " We live in a state of political abnormality without issue or hope . The only solution is the return of Carol through the joint action of opposition leaders and persistent moral pressure on the country . " <P> Prince Carol , he went on , was convinced that there is a growing movement for a Republic . " Every day 's events strengthen the Prince 's con victions . Hence his desire to return is merely an expression of his anxiety to strengthen the Regency . "
