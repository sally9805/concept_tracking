As the wife of a Christian Scientist , Mrs. George Bernard Shaw hesitated for just one day , last week , when her 72-year-old husband caught influenza , and then , despite his protests , called a physician . <P> The husband of Mrs. Shaw recently sold to an English review a cowardly attack on the physicians of George V. He insinuated that they did not employ a certain mode of treatment " because the inventor was both an American and a Jew . " His courage was such that his insinuations-although unquestionably directed against the royal physicians-were cast in the form of an allegory and entitled An Improbable Fantasy . <P> Charlotte Frances Payne-Townshend and George Bernard Shaw , 42 , were married in 1898 . She had just nursed him back to health after a severe accident . She is gracious , completely self-effacing , smart , Irish . Her principal achievement has been to translate most of the plays of Eugene Brieux-previously considered an obscene French playwright by most Englishmen-and to get them triumphantly produced in London , after years of bickering with the Lord-Chamberlain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their famed quarters in Adelphi Terrace when the building was torn down , and live today in a modern elevator apartment ( " service flat " ) overlooking the Thames .
