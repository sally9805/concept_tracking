Two weeks ago M. Caillaux came , last week he went , and all he achieved by his coming and his going was to settle that the French War Debt to the U. S. should be left unsettled . <P> The Negotiations . The history of the attempts to reach a final debt accord is simple : a French proposal , an American counterproposal , a second French proposal-all rejected . Then as M. Caillaux was about to depart the Americans made an offer for a tentative arrangement , which M. Caillaux said he would take home and think over . <P> Proposal No. 1 . M. Caillaux 's first offer called for payments in general as follows : $25,000,000 a year for five years ; $30,000,000 a year for the next five years ; $60,000,000 a year for the next ten years ; $90,000,000 a year for 42 years-then the extinction of the debt . One might calculate what part of these payments was to be principal , what part interest , as one chooses . The principal of the French debt is $3,340,000,000 , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French proposal provided about $4,650,000,000* in payments over 62 years-calculable as repayment of the principal with interest at less than 1% , or payment of higher interest but only a fraction of the principal . <P> Proposal No. 2 . The American counterproposal was for cancelation of about $200,000,000 of accrued interest , bringing the French Debt down to something like a round $4,000,000,000 . Interest was to begin at % and increase% each year until the 13th year , when it would reach 3% , the remainder of the principal to be paid off with that rate of interest over a period of about 62 years . <P> Proposal No. 3 . The second French proposal called for payment of $40,000,000 a year for five years , $60,000,000 a year for seven years , and $100,000,000 a year for 56 years . This would make a total payment of $6,220,000,000 over 68 years . It might be calculated as repayment of the principal with a very low rate of interest or ( as the Americans said in reply ) of interest at 4V2% and repayment of less than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the French hoped to succeed . The American Debt Funding Commission was divided as to whether it should be accepted . Messrs . Mellon , Hoover , Smoot and Crisp ( a subcommittee ) discussed it with President Coolidge . At length it was decided that it too should be rejected . <P> Proposal No. 4 ( tentative ) . By this time the last day of the conference had been reached , and M. Caillaux 's ship was sailing in only a few hours . The Americans then came forward with a tentative - ffer . Let the French acknowledge the principal of the debt and pay $40,000,000 a year for five years , which the U.S. would agree to consider as full discharge of all interest during that period . At the end of that period let a new conference be held . <P> This proposal is really an agreement to accept 1% interest for five years and then have the fight over a final settlement resumed . Its terms , $40,000,000 a year , are the same as the terms for the first five years of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.
