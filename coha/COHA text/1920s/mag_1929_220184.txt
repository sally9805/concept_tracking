Familiar is the figure of the executive who has worked up from office boy or shipping clerk , whose leadership of a company has resulted from long familiarity with all its twists and turns . Less familiar , but recently much in vogue , is what might be termed the Professional Executive . His distinguishing characteristic is the fact that he becomes president of a company not because of what he knows about the company but because of what he knows about being a president . He is in the business of running things , and what he runs is a subordinate factor in the situation . Thus last December ( TIME , Dec. 10 ) Hiram Staunton Brown was made president of Radio-Keith-Orpheum with .10 previous experience in the amusement business , and resigned from presidency of U. S. Leathe which he had assumed at a time when he knew little about leather . <P> Last week another Brown became president of a company with which he has had less than two years ' experience . He is Lewis H. Brown , who , at 35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeds the late Theodore Merseles . Both Mr. Brown and Mr. Merseles came to Johns-Manville in August , 1927 , Mr. Merseles as President and Mr. Brown as Assistant to the President . Both Mr. Merseles and Mr. Brown came to Johns-Manville from Montgomery Ward , and both made the change after the House of Morgan had become interested in Johns-Manville . Thus Mr. Brown was , in effect , transferred from mail-orders to roofing , said good-bye to catalogues and greeted shingles . It is conceivable enough that should the Morgan group acquire a soap factory and need a good executive for it , Mr. Brown might cease to concern himself with roofing and begin to concern himself with soap . <P> There is , of course , no good reason why the professional executive should not be successful in many and varied lines . The emphasis in U. S. industry has shifted from production to distribution , and a distribution expert should be able to function with equal facility whether he is distributing Montgomery Ward merchandise or Johns-Manville roofings . Furthermore , he is always working with other executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown has as his Board Chairman William R. Seigle , who has been with Johns-Manville for 29 years. * <P> <P> *Mr . Seigle succeeds H. E. Manville , who resigned from Board Chairmanship . Mr. Manville 's daughter , Estelle Romaine Manville , recently ( TIME , Dec. 10 ) married Count Folke Bernadotte , nephew of King Gustaf of Sweden .
