Gradually extra-creedal Christianity begins to put its substance into shape . Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick has long preached the " religion of Jesus " in contrast to the " religion about Jesus , " and the public is beginning to acquire a fair idea of what he means . <P> Last week brought forth the first concrete lesson in Dr. Fosdick 's idea of a church . He will accept the pastorate of the Park Avenue Baptist Church , Manhattan , on one major condition : it must be " inclusive . " This general idea , translated into specific requirements , meant : <P> 1 ) That membership must be open to all who profess themselves Christians according to the so-called " evangelical " manner-i.e. , Baptist , Congregationalist , Methodist , Presbyterian and the like . <P> 2 ) That rites or doctrines which distinguish Baptists from other evangelicals are not to be de rigueur . ( Of these , the most picturesque is the Baptist belief that the body of a convert must be totally immersed in water-either running water such as the River Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches from Catholic to Calvinist are content with symbolical sprinkling of water on the forehead . ) <P> " Inclusiveness " was acceptable to the retiring pastor , Dr. Cornelius Woelfkin , to John Davison Rockefeller Jr. , to other deacons and trustees of the church . <P> Dr. Fosdick made minor conditions which were also accepted : his salary is not to exceed $5,000 ; he must continue his teaching at Union Theological Seminary ; a larger church , seating 2,500 , must be built in the neighborhood of Columbia University , several miles from the residential district in which the church is now located . And also , as a graceful gesture , Dr. Fosdick could not accept until the Presbyterian General Assembly officially refused to permit the First Presbyterian Church , Manhattan , to take him back into its pulpit . It was thought that the church members would follow their leaders in accepting the Fosdick conditions .
