txt A Grievance Committee of the Army and Navy Club of America , headed by Martin Vogel , is making an investigation of a series of charges , the chief of which is that no proper accounting has been made for money raised in 1920 when a drive was held in the ' name of the club for $3,000,000 for a memorial to officers who died in the war . Some of the charges will be laid before District Attorney Banton today , according to complainants who declare that the investigation has been blocked for months and that the situation calls for an inquiry by the Grand Jury . Contributions were obtained from ? the ublic , especially from the families of slain soldiers for the officers ' memorial in 1920 . Families were also called upon for photographs , letters , citations and decorations of officers who died in the war , it was said , for the purpose of framing them in a memorial room , which was intended to become eventually , a fairly complete record of officers who lost their lives in the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been impossible to discover what became of the money contributions , and that the photographs and letters were  --  neglected and permitted to become watersoaked and that some of them were destroy d . Former Governor Resigned . Charges of forgery , misappropriation of club funds , the theft of a $2,500 piano , the illegitimate sale or an $8,500 set of chandeliers and other furnishings are made against a former Governor of the club who has resigned . Charges are made that this officer was improperly shielded and assisted by others . Other accusations in great variety are before the Grievance Committee . Many of the charges were denied yesterday by Governors and other officers of the club , while others were held to be exaggerated . The derelictions of a former Governor , who ' resigned in the course of his trial on charges , were admitted . Some of the Governors asserted that the money raised in 1920 had been satisfactorily accounted for , and others said they were not clear as to what had happened , because the matter had occurred before their term 's in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to bring ready money into the club 's treasury last year , was so mismanaged that $34,000 was spent to procure $24,000 in entrance fees and dues for one year . Much of the $34,000 , it was said , was squandered in unnecessary salaries , as high as $175 a week , while a large sum was spent in commissions to club members who obtained other members . General Weld 's Commission . It was stated in the petition Of the complainants that Brig . Gen. De , Witt Weld had accepted a commission of $5,000 while Chairman of a committee to effect the purchase of the German Club in Central Park South , which is now the building of the Army and Navy Club . This was defended yesterday as an ordinary real estate transaction in which the firm with which General Weld is connected received a commission from the former owner of the din for negotiating the sale . Th s charges relate to only a few men of the total membership of nearly 3,000 . Some of the most eminent men in the service and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and members of the club , and were too much occupied with their own affairs to scrutinize tile affairs of the club carefully . it was asserted , so that a small group obtainea practical . control of the club in 1919 . Brigadier General Howard S. Borden , Chairman of the Finance Committee of the club , said yesterday : " I have no first nand information about the drive in 1920 , as it was before my time in office , but I believe that a small amount o- money was raised and that it has been satisfactorily accounted for . " We had some unpleasant occurrences in the club , but they were being dealt with and are being dealt with . I greatly deplore any unnecessary publicity in con. nection with the matter , which can not but injure the club . The club is a splendid inetitution , representing great things and is fully capable of dealing efficiently within its own doors with any unpleasant situation . " The charge against General Weld is ridiculous . He took no commission at all , btrt the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,500 from the owners . He told about the matter at the time and I do n't remember any objection that was made to it . " The group insisting on drastic action was described as " the Bolshevik ! " yesterday by several club members who discussed the affair . More than 2,000 men in active service , most of them scattered throughout this country and abroad , are members of the club . which includes ex-officers , retired officers . National Guard officers and associate civilian members . The Governors of the Army and Navy Club at present are Major Elliot C. Bacon , a partner in J. P. Morgan &; Co. : Brig . Gen : Howard S. Borden . Brig. - Gen. Oliver Bridgman , Colonel Franklin Q. Brown of Redmond &; Co. , Colonel John J. Byrne , Colonel John Daniel , Captain W. B. Franklin . Colonel Wade H. Hayes , Brig . Gen.

James Robb , Major J. Beaumont Spencer . Major Almuth C. Vandiver , Brig . Gen. William - Weigel . Brig . Gen. De Witt Weld Jr. , Major Francis Weld , Charles E. Whitmore and Lieut . Colonel F. W. Wilson . The members of the club who signed the petition . on which they say action has been delayed four months , are Captain Victor Barcas , Commander E. H. De I , any ; Captain Charles Holzelerber of Henry Clews &; Co. , a former Governor of the Club . Captain Woodruff L. Post , Lieutenant Barr of the Navy and Commander Bradshaw . The following paragraphs appear in the petition : Petitioners allege that the conditions of the club 's finances is unbusinesslike and unsatisfactory . They insist that all members of the club be mailed within fifteen days a financial statement showing principal items of expenditure since the organization of the club , the obligations incurred and outstanding , the authority therefor . and the expected method of fulfillment . Minutiae of detail is not expected or desired . " ' rant Statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial irregularities discovered and of action taken thereon , together with explanatich of the failure of the Treasurer , the Finance Committee , and the Beard of Governors to advise the members thereof . Petitioners are given to understand that such failure is clue to a mistaken fear that such disclosure might hurt the reputation of the club . ? ' Petitioners allege that reports of the Finance Committee and of the Treasurer presented . at the recent annual - meeting were disingenuous and misleading as aconveying the idea that the Va. ! ' leis ' condition of , the club Is more sat . - tort ' than is actually the case . " Petitioners allege that the above reports were adopted at the last annual meeting without proper discussion because of the steam roller organization of the meeting and the arbitrary rulings or the Ctairman . . " Petitioners allege that the campaign fer membership has been feeble and grossly extravagant . This club now has a membership of only about I per cent . of - those eligible . Petitioners believe that the practice of paying salaries . commissions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petitioners suggest the immediate aliscontinaance cf any existing arrangements for such payments . Petitioners deninre the attitude of the Board of Governors toward Captain Victor Berea &; to wheese aleservence of ethical standarcs Is due the detection of gross financial irregular:a:es in the club 's administration . The posting of the name of Captain Barcas - in the notice inviting complaints to your committee seems . of : - . doubtful necessity . Several . petitioners had no acquaintance with Captain Barcas until their attention was independently attracted - to the unsatisfactory conditions of the club 's affairs . Frank E. Webb , one of those attacked by the complaining members , said yesterday : I understand that the investigation by the Grievance Committee is directed chiefly at a few trouble-makers in the club who are generally known as the Bolsheviki . They have made baseless charges against a great many people connected with the club . Our Board of Governors is composed of the finest men in the United States and the mere fact that the Governors are men of such splendid calibre is a sufficient answer to most of the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may reflect on me personally . The affair will probably end with the ejectment of the troublemakers from the club . " Captain Victor Barcas , one of the signers of the petition , said yesterday that the alleged irregularities were first brought to his attention by employes of the club in April , 1920. tt An investigation and audit , " he said . " brought to light the fact that money had been embezzled. checks had been forged , vouchers had been raised and part of the Christmas money hat been withheld by a member who was then a Governor . Approximately $2,200 in cash was found in his trunk , which he was compelled to return . He was forced to add to this amount making it total $4,000 , and this was paid over as partial restitution . Said It Was Private Fund . - reis explanation was that he was laying aside a little private fund , unknown to any one else , to aid in alterations at the club house . In spite of these disclosures , he was permitted . to remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $40,000 for alterations in the new club house . Those who investigated this affair permitted him to remain on his promise to make amends . " When additional irregularities appeared later , charges were made to the Board of Governors in November of last year . The committee which made the investigation sought to whitewash this Governor . When several of us heard of *this. a committee of six waited on the Board of Governors at their December meeting . In - the course oe ' a stormy- session , the resignation of the man on trial was accepted ' for the good of the club . ' " We made an effort to bring irregularities in the club . then known only to a few , to the attention of the members of the club at large at the annual membership meeting in Januarecof this year , but were overruled by the steam-roller methods of a faction which was determined to prevent the charges from - being made known to club members . A conference was thereupon called which resulted in sending the petition to the Board of Governors late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's affairs . A Grievance Committee was appointed by the President . No Action on Report . " They engaged Major Frank C. Henke , who was not a member of the club , to make a thorough and impartial investigation . He made a voluminous report sustaining the charges of the petition in every ? detail . It was a Scathing report r.nci- piaced the responsibility where it belonged . Although this report was submitted to the Grievance Committee previous to March la. no action has been . taken by them and they have not as yet reported to the Board of Governors . " About six weeks . - ago-  the Grievance Committee called the signers of the petition iii conference , as the Chairman of the committee . General Grote Hutchison ; was oraered to duty ' with troops in Hawaii . The signers of the petition were led to believe that definite action would be taken in the immediate future . No action having been taken up to this date , we were reluctantly compelled to areive at the conclusion that it was , the purpose of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no alternative except to bring the matter to the attention- of the District Attorney , which we will do today . " Franklin Q. Brown . President of the club , declined yesterday to discuss the charges before the Grievance Committee . Captain Charles Holzderber , of the firm of Henry ' Clews Co. , a former Governor of the club , but not the one referred to above , said yesterday that he had seen no accounting of the fund which was raised during the drive for ** in 192Q , and that he thought no full accounting had been made . " I have heard that the materials regarding dead officers furnished by their families had been neglected and the proposed memorial room-where they ' were to be exhibited has not been prepared as yet .
