SUDDEN wealth which comes with the discovery of oil is usually showered on folks who have no knowledge of the blessings of plenty and no sense of the desirability of luxury . If oil were struck in a great city , and if the sudden wealth that came thereby were to fall upon the poor folk of the town , these same poor folk would quickly find their way to the delights of riches . Are they not familiar with the evidences of wealth ? Limousines and the opera , gowns and furs , racing cars and cabarets , breakfast in bed , and journeys in Pullmans , pursuing summer sunshine across the continent ? the poorest citizens of our towns know of all these luxuries and their like . Put wealth into their hands , and they will find such things shortly , ' without study or effort . But the wealth which comes from oil falls , in part , upon folks different from city dwellers . It is a bleak land , usually , in which oil is found . Now and then it happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discovery of oil , but , in the main ? and this is pleasant to consider ? it is the struggling farmer , the man who is fighting nature in antagonistic soil , in what the Texas farmers call " a billy-goat land , " who suddenly finds himself rich beyond all his dreams and discovers that it will not be necessary for him or his family ever to toil again . Wealth finds him , indeed , unprepared and unequipped to seek the full advantages that riches may summon , but there is a fascinating interest in watching him and his wife , his daughters , and his sons , in their desperate attempts to realize that they , of all the people in the world , they who had never tried to be rich orever expected to be rich , but who had , in reality , thought themselves doomed to desperate toil all their forlorn lives , have suddenly become rich folks through no efforts of their own . The processes by which wealth may come so suddenly to a farmer in an out-of-the-way corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the farmer 's portion of wealth is assured . One day , let us imagine , there comes to him an oil man , who wants to drill for oil on the little farm . This oil man may be a " wildcatter , " a gambler among drillers , who takes his chances in unknown fields . He will ask the farmer to sell him a one-year lease on a certain number of acres , if not on the entire farm . The farmer will be lucky if the leaser offers him more than five dollars for an acre ; many " wildcatters " are willing to pay only one dollar an acre on virgin soil , in a community where no drilling has been done . With the deal closed , the papers signed , and the money delivered , the oil man goes his way . From that time on tranquillity is unknown in the farmhouse ; either bitter disappointment or news of wealth will one day enter its door . The leaser may immediately move a " rig " to the farm and begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a speculator who will take his lease away to the city and sell it there , if he can , for more than he paid for it . In all events , some one must drill on that land within a year , or the lease expires . If the " rig " is set up , and the drills bite down into an oil bed , the farmer , by law , will have one eighth of all the oil that comes from the well . State inspectors will watch the flow and will keep their eyes on the records of the company , and every week the company will place in a bank , to the credit of the lucky farmer , a sum equal to one eighth of all the income which the oil of that well has earned . The wise farmer ? and there are not many of them ? does not lease his entire farm to the oil man . If oil is struck in his neighborhood it will be possible for him to lease the remainder of his land for as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth , if the oil comes in . In every " oil community " there is the farmer who was the pioneer in granting an oil lease . He got little for the oil rights on his place , but his neighbors , profiting by his gamble , merely for granting newcomers the right to drill , receive hundreds , and even thousands , of times as much money as he did . A farmer in the Texas district sold the rights on his 400 acres at one dollar an acre . It was a " billy-goat " farm , on which he had worked like a slave . Four wells that were struck there brought in 16,000 barrels of oil a day . Of these he got 2,000 barrels . At $5 a barrel , the price at that time , his income was $10 , - 000 a day . The man who had bought the lease at one dollar an acre sold a lease on eighty of the acres at $7,000 an acre , and the other 320 acres brought him $21,000 an acre , over $6,000,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $400 . The value of leases on other near-by farms went up to more than $20,000 an acre , and though some of the near-by farms yielded no oil , the farmers became millionaires through the sale of drilling rights . Such easy , unexpected , and comparatively vast wealth throws human nature into some of its oddest moods . As I moved about among such newly rich folk as these in the Southern oil lands , some weeks ago , I found myself looking on them as human vessels under which a fire of desire had suddenly been lighted ; I found myself trying to see what things had come to the top in the violent boiling of emotions , and I learned that each broth of human nature was different from all the others . Youth and age , for instance , pass through the experience with different emotions . Age immediately seeks security and comfort . In a town in Kansas , on a board fence which surrounds a small fair ground , you may see painted an extraordinary picture . It shows an old farmer and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rambling old house . They are looking out contentedly on a rich wheat field in which the harvesters are working . " John . Smith and His Farm " are the words beneath the sign . " John Smith " explained his sign to his fellows in luck . It showed a most peculiar lack of knowledge of the first principles of advertising . " All these town fellows who git along in business put up signs tellin ' how smart they be , " said John , " and maw and I , after we got our money , jes ' allowed we 'd do a little braggin ' ourselves . " He and " maw , " in truth , were fixed for life after years of labor , and if there was any better news in the world than that to fix up in bright colors on a signboard he did n't know it . A sudden flow of oil on the average farm is as paralyzing as a flow of lava from Vesuvius . Just as Pompeii was stopped in the midst of its daily gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an under - side richer than its top-side comes to a dead standstill when the stroke of good fortune falls . That little farm has its big moment , indeed . For weeks , and perhaps even months , the occupants of the farmhouse have been going about their chores in a half daze , waiting for the day when the drillers will " shoot the well . " The time comes at last . There is little work done in that neighborhood that day , no matter how great the need . All the farm folks for miles around gather at the well and watch the experts lower sons and daughters had been horn , and then we went to the other end of the little farm where it faces the main road , to see the new house . The Walkers had moved from there , I was told . They had stayed there in the new house on a corner of their old farm for three months , but new wells had come in on the farm and the balance at the bank had piled up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town . Trailing down the Walkers , I went into Cushing , and on a finely shaded , finely lawned , and evidently exclusive street I was shown the new Walker home . It was late afternoon , and on the front porch , clad in crisp white summer garments , sat a plump little woman , with her hands folded across her ample lap . " Is this Jess Walker 's new house ? " I asked . " Yes , ' t is , " said the little woman . I explained that I had seen and photographed the other two Walker homes , and that I should like to take a picture of this one . " Go ahead , " she said , " but jes ' step in . I don ' want to be taken . " When she returned to the porch , after the camera had snapped , she said : " This ai n't our newest house , though . We bought a better one last week and we 're movin ' soon . " She gave us the address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , on the outskirts of the town in the newest and most aristocratic addition , it was too dark to take a picture . The latest " new house " of the Walkers was a great , rambling bungalow of the California type . And only eighteen months before their home had been that miserable little but which was now surrounded by oil wells ! The Walkers ran to new houses , it seemed . And from all I could hem they were not running one tenth fast enough to keep up with the balance that was growing with the addition of weekly checks in the local banks . Now and then , among these newly rich folk , you come across a man who by some strange and unexpected mental strength has carried through the hard years a dream which his new wealth helps him to bring true . Down in the Texas oil fields there stands a brick hotel which is a monument to a man who had such a dream . It is known as McCloskey 's hotel , and for the oil men it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wet and muddy and dreary land . No finer meals are obtainable in the United States than at this hotel , the oil men say . On a winter 's evening , when the mud-covered oil men enter the place in their dirty boots and leave their tracks from the front door to the dining room , one can be sure that , though muddy as the hard-wood floors may be , everything in the room along and above the level of the table tops , including the napery , the silver , the tableware , and the food , is as fine and clean as can be found . The oil men will tell you about McCloskey . McCloskey was a bricklayer who had turned farmer . Things had gone very badly with him on this bad land ; he was nearing the end of his rope , and , indeed , the end of his years , when the oil strike came . McCloskey had always dreamed , they say , that sometime there would be a town near his isolated farm . When his wealth began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his dream come true . To start a town one must first have a hotel , said McCloskey . Therefore he bought bricks at fabulous prices , wherever he could find them , and had them shipped to him , at extraordinarily high rates , gathered together the few bricklayers he could discover in the countryside , and began the job of building . He laid bricks himself , did McCloskey , to set a pace for the workers , but just as the building was being finished he caught cold from a hard , winter day 's work , and died of exhaustion . But his hotel is there , running full blast , and the town has come at last to edge and overlap his farm , just as he had dreamed . There are other men , of course , with lesser dreams . In the Burke-Burnette district one rich farmer , who never in all his life had been able to buy all the canned peaches he wanted , ate himself to death in a canned-peach orgy . In the main , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after wealth has come to them . An automobile and a new house satisfy the first cravings for luxury . New clothes come in for attention , but there is so much discomfort in new and expensive gowns and vestments that most of the new-rich farmers and their wives ? but this applies only to the old folks ? soon discover that there is a luxury in the comfort of good , familiar old clothes , such as Mother Hubbards and overalls , that money can not buy ; and there is a double satisfaction in being so rich that you can wear old clothes without being suspected of poverty . The axiom that wealth brings suffering and worry to human beings is one which one does not see carried out among these people . To be able to have everything you want in this world is a dangerous situation , in truth , but to have only simple wants restores the balance of safety . There are stories , indeed , and somewhat pitiful ones , too , of educated men such as lawyers or young clerks , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs with their new wealth . Sometimes they are saved by more level-headed friends . In a certain place in Oklahoma there was a young lawyer who had the proudest spirit of any man in town . He had many friends , but he never called on them for advice or help , even when things were going very badly with him in business . He paddled his own canoe , and for a long time , it seemed , he paddled it very badly . The fact of the matter was , he was saving money for a certain purpose . He piled up his little fund dollar by dollar while the VOL CXLIII ? No. 854. - 32 neighbors were pitying his wife for her lack of pleasures , and when finally he had enough money he put it all into a farm of one hundred and sixty acres , in a district remote from the oil country . " It will be a place to crawl to if things go too bad in the city , " he laughingly told his friends . He struggled on with his law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men moved his way . He sold a lease for a few acres of his land and the drills bit into a lake of oil . Actually and literally , overnight , he became a millionaire . And then came his really unhappy days . He would go to his little office and sit and sit and sit ; law business which came his way he turned over to others . Down at the bank , he knew , checks were coming in for deposit to his account , not only weekly , but daily ; they were checks not in the hundreds , but in the tens of thousands . At one time he was greatly worried to discover that he had forty thousand dollars more in bank than he thought . He seemed to have come to a standstill , stunned by his success . Two or three times a day he would go down to the bank , . walk up and down the lobby floor , apparently sunk in deep thought , and then walk out again . Beyond keeping track of his seven-figured bank account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last , for the first time in his career in that town , he humbled himself one day and went to a lawyer friend and asked his advice : " What ' 11 I do ? " he said . " I ca n't go on this way . I do n't seem to be able to get interested in anything . " A group of his friends held a conference and decided to advise him to go into the business of buying Liberty bonds ; they realized , as he did himself , that without an occupation in life he would be ruined , at least mentally , even with all his wealth . The advice proved his salvation . He opened an office , and by means of banking connections scoured the country for bargains in Liberty bonds . Automobiles , a new home , a trip to Europe , all followed in due course , after his interest in life revived , though before that time he had bestirred himself only sufficiently to purchase one set of wicker furniture , which his good wife had promptly sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his millions and is one of the busiest men in his town . " But it was horrible during those days I was standing still , " he has often told his friends . Generally , however , people follow their natural bent when the sudden oil wealth comes . There is a big , husky , uneducated young man in a large Texas city who has solved the problem of using his wealth to his own satisfaction and to the joy of many of his neighbors . He bought a house in a well conditioned but not fashionable part of town , had it tripled in size , built a gymnasium , swimming pool , and billiard room in the basement , laid out a tennis court and a baseball ground in the neighborhood , and now he keeps open house for all the athletically inclined boys and girls in the district . During the baseball season his three or four automobiles run around to the offices where acquaintances are working , and carry them to box seats in the grand stand as his guests . He tests a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes have brought more pleasure to their owners than his . One man whose trail I crossed is enjoying , with his wealth , a lifelong joke on his brother . Together the two bachelor brothers ran a farm in the " billy-goat " country that kept them alive only with desperate toil . The elder brother got sick of the game ; he felt he was getting too little sugar for his penny . " I 'm going to find some place where you do n't have to work so hard for a living , " he declared . He sold out his half to his brother and went off to the city to work on the railroad . Ten years later the railroader received a telegram calling him back to the farm ; it was the first word he had received from it . His brother met him at the railroad station in a great car , and took him through lanes of oil derricks to a great house in one corner of the old farm . " Got a place fer you here , Jim , " ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said nothin ' would ever come out of this ole farm , but I worked like hell raisin ' onions , and saved a leetle every year , and now we 're all fixed fer life . " The brothers live together now in such luxury as they desire , with several million dollars to spend , if they choose , and their place is called the " Onion House . " The brothers never admit to each other that the money came in any other way than by onions . " Bill is sure some onion grower , " is a local joke that delights the heart of the millionaire stay-at-home . It is not often that a farmer who has made a fortune in oil by no efforts of his own , sinks any of his wealth in oil gambles . Enough money to live on in comfort or luxury the rest of their days seems to be about all that the average farmer and his family ask from oil . It is difficult to create new wants after one 's life has been set in the mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you want it is about all the average new rich ask of fortune . All above that is a comforting abundance which lies undrawn in the bank . Now and then , however , in a waning field , the farmers take a renewed interest in affairs as they see the attention of the oil men directed to other areas than theirs . In the town of Cushing there is a hero of the community who has put new wealth in the farmers ' pockets . The oil craze of some years ago died out and left Cushing somewhat fiat . Everybody had money laid away , but it looked as if the incoming flow of gold had ceased . Milton Thompson , who owned 160 acres , on which he had made a small fortune in previous years , conceived the idea that the wells were failing because they had not been drilled deep enough in the first place . He figured out that S00 feet more would bring in a new oil supply . All the other farmers were holding their leases at the old high figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away a lease on his farm . The company that drilled went down to the usual 2,700 feet , and found no oil . Thompson begged them to continue . At 3,500 feet they brought in a huge well . Thompson 's fortune , as well as that of everyone in the community , was immediately multiplied . One farm which Thompson had bought for $2,000 he sold , it is said , at Cushing , for $575,000 within a few days . The population of the town increased fourfold within the next year , and in one year the bank deposits jumped from $1,713,000 to $3,500,000 . As a town boomerThompson is famous far and wide in the Cushing country . it is the city man who has a taste for wealth and who , through experience , has learned not to fear the world and its ways , who puts the money he has made in oil back into the oil wells . The oil country abounds in stories of men who have made their fortunes and then have drilled them back into the heart of the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , that the city man who has had rural training , who started out his life as a farmer boy , and who knows the feel of the earth , is safer and surer in his oil investments than the city man who knows only the pavements and to whom an oil well is only a piece of paper and so many checks in the bank , instead of a real hole in real earth spouting forth real oil that will begrime your hands with its richness if you touch it . Harry F. Sinclair , one of the most spectacular successes in the oil fields in recent years , was born in the oil country in Kansas . While his father was not a farmer , Sinclair , in the farming town , got the feel of the oil game and lived among the farm-land oil wells in the early ' nineties . He had all of a farm boy 's familiarity with the good earth , and to him an oil well never existed on paper , as it does to the average city man , but was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil business was never an office business with him , but it took him into the fields and the mud which he had known as a boy . Sinclair has told me in so many words that the difference between him and the average farmer who made a pile out of oil and was content with that , was that , after his oil came , he hated to sell it at a price which others fixed . His next step , therefore , was to establish tanks and pipe lines so that he could either hold his oil until he could get the price he asked or move it away to some point where he could command his own prices instead of yielding to those fixed by " city folks . " His business gradually pushed him forward , but his success is attributed by other oil men to the fact that he had the country boy 's sense of realism in regard to the earth and its products . Another farmer boy who has made a conspicuous success in oil is the famous Charles Page , of Tulsa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a half century ago . About twenty years ago he went out into the Oklahoma country , dead broke , after failing at the mining game in the West and after roughing it along the Pacific coast . When the oil craze started Page was in his element . There was a literalness and a realism about this game of gambling with Mother Earth which he understood . Page was many times a millionaire , it is said , before he even established an office , and then that was the office of a bank which he instituted to care for his own great funds . He lived among the oil derricks and was mentally buried in the earth ; he knew the various earths and sands and stones as a painter knows his colors ; and paper , which is so important to a city man who thinks of wells in terms of stocks and bonds , was an unimportant item with him . To-day he is the founder of Sand Springs , a beautiful suburb of the city of Tulsa , with a population of seven thousand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage than Charlie Page , I have not heard of him . " Come to ' The Hume ' Sunday night , to dinner , " he said to me . " I want to show you something interesting . " Sunday night I met at tables , in a great brick house which in any other case would have been called an orphanage , one hundred and fifty boys and girls , every single one of whom bore the name of Page and had been legally adopted by the big , husky oil man . " They 're not orphans now , " Page explained . " I 'm the daddy of every last one of ' em , and the only reason Mrs. Page and I do n't take ' em over to our own house is because we have n't got room for them there . I 've got a public school for ' em here in Sand Springs , and a high school , and it 's pretty near time for me to start a university , too , because some of ' em arc gettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys and girls dashed at the big man out on the lawn , calling him " daddy , " and begging for a romp . " Go ' way , now . Go ' way ! " he said . " You fellows are too many for me . " We retired to the safety of Page 's big automobile , in which he drove me to a hospital which he has established also with his oil money . Thirty patients were there , under the most expert care and in the most scientific surroundings that money could command . " These children got me started , " he said . " I adopted a few , and then I had to take care of their mothers , of course , when they had any . Pretty soon , as the money came in , I stopped pickin ' and choosin ' among the little fellers in trouble . I just adopted all corners , and the first thing I knew a town was growing up right here . " On a wall at the " Home " I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give only the meat courses : THINK RIGHT M &'-vu; Celery Olives Assorted Nuts Roast Young Bear with Chestnut Dressing Venison Steak with Cranberry Jelly Venison Stew with Vegetables Cold Roast Buffalo and Potato Salad Baked Buffalo Hash Baked Opossum and Candied Yams Roast Mallard Duck with Chestnut Stuffing Baked Sirloin of Elk with Brown Gravy Fried Rabbit on Toast with Cream Gravy Quail on Toast ? " Who had such a dinner as this ? " I asked Page . " We did , " he answered , with a roaring laugh , " here with the kids . It was our Christmas dinner last year , and you should have seen ' em eat . " " But where did you get such food ? " asked . " Why , in my amusement park ! " he answered . " You see , I figured out the children ought to have sort of a playground , and when I got the playground started it seemed to me they ought to have a kind of zoo , so I got that started , and then I put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big merry-go-round at Coney Island , and by the time 1 had a few other things put in to amuse ' cm I had a real Coney Island going . I got our Christmas dinner out of the zoo , and we could have had a lot of other things , too , if we 'd wanted ' em . But I guess we had a big enough Christmas dinner as it was . Things have just sort of grown big on me since I got interested in these kids . " " And do the oil wells grow , too ? " I asked . " I 've missed only two wells in my life , " he said , quietly . There 's oil to be got out of the earth if you can find it , and there 's gold to be got out of the oil . But there 's something to be got out of the gold that most of the folks whom I saw in the oil country seem to have missed . I think big , gruff Charlie Page , has found it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
