HOSE of us whose personal experience is limited to the cloistered colleges of the Eastern states , have a romantic tendency to idealize the unseen coeducational college . Along with the wide grain fields of the Middle West , the automobile industries , the verse of Carl Sandburg , and the prose of Theodore Dreiser , we have thought of it as something large , spontaneous , sound , and free of preciousness . It is a conception that even adolescents share . One hears now and then of a serious-minded Eastern girl who , though having grown up in the Eastern tradition , distrusts the preponderantly feminine atmosphere o , f the woman 's college that has been chosen for her , ? Smith or Vassar or Wellesley or Bryn Mawr , ? and elects instead to enter Oberlin or Ann Arbor because its central idea seems to her more logical and reasonable . And though there are doubtless fewer cases of boys who , forego Harvard or Yale in order to register at Wisconsin or North/ western , the fact remains that to the thoughtful youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevita make a strong appeal . But this sympathetic attitude is naturally based on the bel that coeducation coeducates , ? that is , that it supplies the sa or equivalent conditions for young men and women to live a work in , and that it fosters between the two an interplay of nmi which might in fact easily be supposed to be the main purpi of the arrangement . What first-hand observation does for unprofessional outsider , ? and this is the purport of the prese confession , ? is to undermine this assumption rather lamentably The point should be made , in explanation of the tentativ comments and questionings that follow , that they result front acquaintance with but one set of conditions . But there is reason to suppose that these are typical conditions . In a region where so great uniformity prevails as in the middle western States , it is hard to believe that any institution could succeed in being saliently individual , even were such its ambition . If the college that supplied these data differs very much from scores of other small State-supported " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of superiority . With a more than average percentage of liberal minds on its faculty , and with a man of uncommon quality at its head , it far from deserves to be cited as a horrible example . What appear , from the point of view expressed in these pages , to be its shortcomings , are emphatically the shortcomings of its type . It is without a reservation in the world that the alien betakes himself to the promised land of learning and looks hopefully about the scene , ? a scene that proves to be not only charming , but charming in the familiar way . Swarms of young creatures drift gaily across a campus as classically tree-grown , as traditionally furnished with old brick and ivy , as though it were not next door to the prairies and a minute or so from Main Street . The whole thing is very simple , after all , one tells oneself , ? merely that the girls and boys who were side by side in school have not been arbitrarily separated on reaching college age ,  |p2050  Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women should have four years of daily mental Interchange . If the man 's mind is identical with the woman 's , it is only logical that they should be exposed to the same influences . If they are different , neither should be deprived of the advantage that discovery of this very difference will bring . Then there is the happy circumstance of free personal , association , and the legend , familiar to us all , of those sane , steady friendships , with no nonsense about them , formed in library or laboratory and acquiring just about the time of the final examinations a romantic glow intense enough to light the marriage for a lifetime . Which is all very well . But there is a point , forgotten for a time , that one sooner or later sharply recalls . The term " co-ed " applies only to girls . The boy is educated . The girl is co-educated . A trifle in itself , especially as precisely the same courses are offered to men and women , courses followed at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faculty ,  - -  a faculty , however , composed entirely of men . How much farther , they might ask you , need coeducation go ? But the students themselves know well enough that this is n't the whole story . And if they do n't know it instinctively , there are plenty of voices , from that of the cynically indolent freshman to that of the sentimental orator at Commencement , to assure them that the essential value of their experience consists not at all in what the curriculum may provide , but in something a good deal more elusive , something called " college life . " And " college life , " in this special sense , is made up mostly , as we know , of sports , friendships , " student activities . " It is these , they will tell you , that really develop , that really educate , the student . It is these that the alumnus will emotionally protest he came to college to secure and would consider it nothing short of tragic to have missed . Books ? ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concede this , even in part , is to admit that there is in the plan of the coeducational college a flaw so serious that it is  |p2051  extraordinary it should excite no attention . Because it is pre cisely where these extra-curricular matters are concerned that the young men and young women , as an outsider sees it , do not share equally , are by no means on an equal footing . The matter is worth going into a little ; beginning with its more conspicuous , external features and from these , as it were , working inward . To begin with , there is football . Probably nobody will deny the supremacy that football has gained over all other elements of college life , in any college where it exists at all . And coeducational colleges are a part of the football world . So that in the college now serving as an illustration , for at least a third of the college year , practically all the youths are absorbed by this predominating passion . Not only the lordly few who compose the actual team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , think it , dream it , talk it . Thus is supplied the test whereby a boy proves himself normal and average , rather than highbrow and queer . During this long football season , what of the girls ? The truth is that they watch the heroic pastimes of the men 's athletic field with an appalling passivity . Month after month , they continue mere spectators . They express a real or counterfeited despair when an ominous hush settling upon the campus on a late Saturday afternoon tells that " our " team has Iost , at home or abroad ; and they appear to exult when the lively ringing of the chapel bell , at the same hour , announces that " our " team has won . But in this far-fetched sense of participation they are sharers , of course , in a very common fallacy , the truth being that they have no more to do with the result of a game , in any possible sense , than if they had foregone college life and re mained to dust the family parlor in Gopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this situation is not , naturally , that girls are not admitted to football teams , but that the immensely prevailing power of the football cult among the men seems to suppress whatever desire the girls may have to express themselves similarly . Either they feel that it is hopeless to attempt to compete with a thing so entrenched and power/ 1 , or they may actually believe it appropriate , as their " ladylike " grandmothers would have believed , that the men should be sole representatives of the athletic life of the college . The girls ' basket ball seems rather perfunctory , and not only in the development of this one sport , but in all organized or unorganized play , one would say that they were a good many years behind the women 's colleges . Their habitual campus costume sufficiently betrays them : high heels , narrow skirts , furs hunched about their necks . It seems an almost startling anachronism that in this era of " sports " there should be grouped together hundreds of girls whose whole need of exercise , outside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for outdoor life . One next looks hopefully to discover in the social life of the men and women students somewhat more of the element of give-and-take . But here again the disparity in the life of the two groups seems almost grotesque . Without going into the question of the desirability of secret societies , it may simply be set down that fraternities and sororities exist at such a college and that they powerfully affect in one way or another the happiness of practically every student , ? particularly , of course , the excluded ones . Therefore all the youths representing the operation of the selective principle live in the comfortable , often luxurious fraternity houses and regulate their own lives with a minimum of official interference . It is quite otherwise with the girls . Since there are no sorority houses , there is no conspicuous segregation of the " popular " and " prominent . " The women students live at least two in a room in large , stereotyped dormitories , obey rules , and are answerable for the disposition of their time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the men , who may seek the girls ' society as much as they please . But before a girl may acquiesce in a proposed scheme of amusement , she must obtain her Dean 's permission . It may or may not be necessary that an undergraduate should go to bed , or pretend to go to bed , at a certain hour . What  |p2053  certainly could n't be argued is that such a measure is any more or any less imperative in the women 's case than in the men 's . Yet the women are n't allowed lights after ten , while the men , who the authorities very well know would n't tolerate such a restric tion , are discreetly overlooked . And this is only one detail . Now either or both these opposed systems might of course be eloquently defended , ? the liberty that the men enjoy and the restrictions imposed upon the girls . The only point now being made is that they are totally opposed systems and that they therefore can not serve to " coeducate " the students but must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but tangible watershed be tween them . A perfectly definite psychology is imparted to the youth . He is led to think of himself as competent to form his own judgments , free to follow his own desires and therefore naturally superior to a student who is kept on a tether . And the girl acquires a psychology no less definite : that of a person who is supervised , questioned , protected , whose inferiority is implicit in the code that governs her . Furthermore , when one compares her days with those of the woman 's college undergraduate , it stems as though the " co-edsuffered some inhibition of her social as she does of her athletic impulse . An outsider has the impression that among themselves coeducated girls have a listless social life , and that since they are uninterested in forming independent groups , vigorous leaders fail to stand out among them . But neither do they express themselves freely and naturally in the general social life , control of which they have yielded , as has already been pointed out , to the men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency seems to be toward suppressing personality , in so far as it is individual and characteristic . Unhappily , too , since there are more women than men , the competitive factor exists , and with it , the really debasing temptation , to the girl , to be something other , and often lesser than she is , something more frivolous and more unstable , in order to be approved and chosen , ? and to have , that is , any social life at all . A coeduca tional college must be the hardest place in the world for an  |p2054  eighteen-year old girl to remain faithful to her genuine self . There remains the field of " student activities , " where , if anywhere , the students should meet on equal terms . But five minutes ' inspection of the college bulletin board will sufficiently indicate how completely there prevails the unwritten law that of any group in which power or responsibility is vested , a man student must stand at the head . The class president , for instance , is always a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobody ever mentions it or even thinks about it . But can we suppose that it is without its psychological sequences ? Of this unwritten law in operation , noticeable instances suggest themselves . In the college where these impressions were formed there existed a few years ago no literary monthly . A group of young women with an urge in this direction , trying but failing to rouse their men classmates to the point of cooperation , planned , wrote , and issued such a magazine . After the publication of several numbers they were halted by the administration and reminded that in a coeducational college anything so conspicuous as a literary monthly must not be issued by an editorial board composed entirely of women . And when men were appointed to the reorganized board , a man was by administrative decree made editor-in-chief . To no one connected with the college , except perhaps to one or two of the superseded girl editors , did this seem an unfair action . On another occasion the college obtained publicity throughout the country from the fact that the " student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerable and forced him out of the college . But in this matter the women students were given no chance either to obstruct or aid . It is not on record that any woman student , in the college at least , has ever openly revolted against the code that assigns her to second place , whatever her ability . But if she did , she would have to combat the unanimous adherence of students and faculty to the traditional notion , so thoroughly outgrown in many parts of the outside world , that men , by sheer virtue of their gender ,  |p2055  must always lead , women always follow . And she would have to combat , too , the belief that her very presence in the college is in the nature of an encroachment . Before coeducation was thought of , this was a college for men . The reason still given for excluding women from the faculty is that there is a masculine tradition to sustain . Naturally no such deference is paid to any other outgrown view once held by the founders of the col lege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words : woman 's position in the coeducational college has yet to be legitimatized . It would be very strange if the everyday conditions that have been instanced did not affect the character of the students ' men tal development ; and as a matter of fact it seems pretty clear that they do . The students can not or do not strip themselves of their artificial form of sex-consciousness in order to make a direct mental approach to the subject their professor is pre senting . Before they can speak aloud a natural sentence , the youth must make it clear to his special audience that he is always and unwaveringly the dominating male ; the girl must suggest unmistakably that she is guiltless of any views the dominating male might refuse to tolerate . It is easy to imagine how serious a mental handicap this must be . More than this , they even outwardly dramatize these mental postures . A survey of one of these classrooms would astound a liberal-minded social philosopher beholding it for the first time . To the front rows drift the exponents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , on parade . Their hair arrangements are intricate and laborious , they are soft of eye and of voice , their effervescence is charmingly subdued . Behind them lounge the boys , rough-shirted , unkempt , taciturn , as determined to overdo their crude masculine pose as the girls are to overdo the traditional feminine . The paradoxical oppo site , all this , of the results coeducation has been counted upon to produce . This situation naturally could not remain as clear cut as it is if the students were not so profoundly unaware of realities that lie outside the campus gates , ? a defect , of course , that most  |p2056  collegians share . It may not be altogether surprising that they should be ignorant of contemporary arts . But they are almost as unaware of political issues and of practically all important questions . In a day when the woman 's movement throughout the world has reached so significant a stage , it seems almost incredible that young women of twenty should smilingly tell you that they have never thought anything about the status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they scarcely even know the meaning of the terms . Jane Addams may be the most widely known woman in this country . She is , at all events , a figure that you would suppose college girls could hardly avoid being informed about . Yet when Miss Addams came to speak at the college , on a topic she was no less eager than competent to discuss , the brief time she had to give was consumed in answering questions of the most elementary sort about Hull House , ? questions that the better-informed student in the woman 's college of a generation ago would n't have dreamed of asking . The post-graduation plans , too , are betraying . Some of the girls expect to teach , but professional or artistic achievement , even economic independence in itself , seems to lure them not overmuch and most of them are rather frank in their hope of marrying young and prosperously . Nor are the men bent on serious professional careers . The dull youths look unimaginatively forward to " business , " the clever ones , and without reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these may separately have little significance ; but taken together they surely go to establish that there is , after all , no really profitable mental association between coeducated students and that everybody knows there is n't . It seems also clear that the illiberal tradition outside the classroom is at fault . But the baffling circumstance is that nobody concerned in the coeducational arrangement has any interest in discussing it . One exception to this statement does stand out : ? there is a very general willingness to debate whether or not the students have too great an opportunity to develop romantic interest in  |p2057  each other . Perhaps this is merely because adults everywhere like to gossip about the love-making proclivities of the young , but at all events , within the circle , discussion very nearly begins and ends with this one consideration . Meanwhile , the looker-on without the circle comes to the conclusion that the influence of the sex-urge is the one element in the life of the coeducational college that can be trusted to take care of itself . Need their elders , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certain set of rules in force , a greater number of students develop absorbing attachments for each other than under another set of rules ? One feels that if the academic police that are so vigilant at every college could dismiss their own obsessing fear of that small percentage of cases , frivolous , scandalous , whatever they may be called , that are going to happen anyway , their minds would be freer to approach their own special edu cational problem , which is so far from being permanently solved . But either these impressions of a single observer are totally misleading , or else some at least of the eminent persons con nected with coeducation are satisfied with the word alone . In fact , the dreary suspicion occurs to one that those in immediate charge of coeducation may be those that believe in it least , that are even least interested in it . It seems even not unfair to sug gest that their ambition is largely negative . They feel , that is , that they are achieving all that could be asked of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too frequent or sensational . If the idea of the coeducational college includes any serious challenge to the older type of institution , nobody ever expresses it . If these teachers believe that educating men and women together ought to result in some finer human product than the separate colleges can show , nothing they ever say or do betrays this belief . So that the searcher is obliged to conclude that the very thing he had expected to find at the core of coeducation not only does n't exist , but is so far unhoped for , unthought of . Coeducational colleges may already exist where the boys and girls start even and continue without handicaps . If not , the development of one should tempt some educational pioneer .  |p2058
