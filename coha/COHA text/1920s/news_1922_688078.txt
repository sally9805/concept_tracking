txt John Bergen , the handsome young daredevil of the movies , who was shot and killed by George F. Cline , a moving picture location man , at Edgewater , N. J. , on Friday night , turned out yesterday to have been a married man , although he had represented himself as a bachelor . His wife . Mrs. May Bergen of 164 West 128th Street , went to Edgewater after reading the newspaper accounts of her husband 's death and was confronted in the police station there by Mrs. Mary Cline , ' Whose relations with Bergen were responsible for the shooting . The two women kissed each other , and wept as they discussed the tragedy . The widow , however , displayed no sorrow at her husband 's fate . " He deserved just what he got , " she said . It seemed that he had deserted her and her daughter , Margaret , a year after their marriage in 1111 . They bad met as dancing partners in a minstrel show given by tile Church of St. John the Baptist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Field Artillery , New York National Guard , where he had learned the horsemanship that he later capitalized as . a " Wild West " performer in vaudeville and the movies . When the war came , though he had deserted her , she obtained his exemption from the draft , and he did not serve with the colors . From then to the time of his death , she said , his career had been a succession of amorous affairs . Both Women Are Mothers . Neither the woman who was deserted nor the woman who was betrayed is a striking beauty . Mrs. Bergen is tall and thin , and shows the strain she Lae bee-1 *under in supporting herself and her child for the last four years . The other woman is somewhat better looking and better dressed , but she also si-ows the effect of a mental struggle . Mrs. Cline Is of medium height , rather plump , with attractive features . She , too , Is a mother , having a little boy and girl . She 26 years old , several years younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into the movies a year ago he had become well known for his " daredevil " stunts , which he had performed for the Fox , Selznick and other companies . He has doubled for Eugene O'Brien and other movie stars in performing dangerous stunts . Bride Thirteen " was one of the pictures he had appeared in . When Bergen died in the Edgewater police station a short time . after the shooting , a piece of blood-stained paper with the words , " George Cline killed me , " was found in his pocket , as was told in the original story of the shooting . The wounded man evidently had written this after he had been shot , in the realization that lie was dying and would be unable to make an oral statement . In addition to this document , however , Prosecutor A. C. Hart of Bergen County , announced yesterday that another note was found in the dead man 's pocket , which had been written before the shooting , and in which Bergen said that he expected Cline to shoot him . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am shot in the next few weeks , it will be done by a George Cline , alias George Watz , of Edgewater , N. J. For reasons unknown to me he is ' hreatening me . ? No doubt a German Lueger , calibre .25 , will be used , as it is a favorite of his many guns . I am John Bergen , 214 East 115th Street . " Note Is Important Evidence . Prosecutor Hart considers this note an important Piece of evidence , as it shows that Bergen had been threatened by Cline , and may be used to prove premeditation . If it can be shown that Bergen wrote the note some day previous to Friday , it may also go to disprove Cline 's version of the shooting and the events that preceded it , because it might indicate that Mrs. Cline had previously told her husband of her relations with Bergen , whereas Cline insists that she did not tell him until Friday morning . Cline , who was held without bail on the charge of murder in the Bergen County jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooting yesterday . He said that not only he but his wife had telephoned to Bergen oil Friday afternooni  --  inviting Bergen to come to the Cline 's nome at Edgewater to discuss the . whole situation . And when Bergen arrived at the house , not only Cline and his wife , but - Mrs . Cline 's two grown brothers , were lined up inside the door to confront him . It waa one of her brothers who handed to Cline the pistol with which the shooting was done , and it was with this pistol that Cline chased the terror-stricken Bergen when he ran out of the house in fear of his life and forced him back into the house to meet his death . According to the Prosecutor , Cline changed his story yesterday in some important particulars . In his original story of the duel that he proposed between himself and Bergen on account of his wife 's honor . he did not explain why the duel was not fought . He merely said that after giving Bergen a pistol and t ling him to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting came afterward , when he was forced to shoot in self-defense because Bergen attacked him with a blackjack . The whole thing , he said , took place in the pr ? sence of Mrs. Cline and her two brothers . Intended to Fight in Dark . vestertlay , however , he admitted that he hail lied in this . His amended version of the shooting is that after Bergcn had confessed his - intimacy with Cline before the latter and her brothers he took Bergen upstairs to a ica:ari where they were alone , handed him a pistol and was about to turn c.if the gas so that the duel could be fought in the dark when Bergen ; - ointed his gun at him and seemed : bout to shoot him down treacherously . Then , Cline now says , - he sprang at Berg-en and grasped the pistol , which went off while it was still in Bergen 's grasp . The shot thus fired while the two men were struggling for the gun , Cline says , was responsible for Bergen 's death .
