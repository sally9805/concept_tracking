Financial press agents fought doughtily all week , as they did less conspicuously for three preceding weeks , over a national railway problem , essentially political , secondarily financial . The problem is whether there are to be four or five dominant trunk-lines westward from New York . The fifth , if at all , would be organized and run by Leonor Fresnel Loree , who now controls the Delaware &; Hudson . Mr. Loree , grizzly-bear of railroads , Harriman 's successor in talent , conferred for nearly three hours . His conferees represented four trunk-line adversaries : the Pennsylvania , the New York Central , the Baltimore &; Ohio and the Van Sweringen merger group ( once planned to be based on the Nickel Plate , now planned to be based on the Chesapeake &; Ohio ) . <P> Shrewd , the anti-Loree interests got the following statements into the newspapers : <P> 1 ) That Mr. Loree would abandon his fifth trunk system plan . ( TIME , April 27 , 1925 et seq . ) <P> 2 ) That Mr. Loree would within seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of directors for the Van Swer-ingen 's system . <P> 3 ) That Mr. Loree , ill , had been advised by physicians not to attend merger debates . <P> 4 ) That Mr. Loree was marking time in his Eastern merger negotiations because of his troubles with the Interstate Commerce Commission over his Kansas City Southern-Missouri , Kansas &; Texas-Cotton Belt merger in the Southwest . <P> All these points were , with varying emphasis , denied by Loree soldiers . <P> <P> If Mr. Loree 's opponents succeed in crowding him out of the Eastern trunk-line field the following mergers will in all probability become effective as long planned : <P> 1 ) The Wabash Railroad will go bodily into the Baltimore &; Ohio System . <P> 2 ) The Lehigh Valley will be divided half- &-half; between the Pennsylvania and the Van Sweringen group . <P> 3 ) The Buffalo , Rochester &; Pittsburgh will be divided between the Baltimore &; Ohio and the New York Central . <P> 4 ) The Delaware &; Hudson will remain an independent or " bridge " line . <P> 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6 ) The Virginian will be split between the Norfolk &; Western and the Van Sweringen group . <P> 7 ) The Lackawanna will go to the New York Central . <P> 8 ) The Pennsylvania will be given a Chicago-St . Louis short line by Interstate Commerce Commission consent . <P> If Mr. Loree 's adversaries fail , there may come into being a fifth Eastern trunk-line system . Last week Loree stood silent . His faithful lieutenants howled " press agent " at adverse propaganda , as usual . Three years the battle has raged . Significantly , April First is fixed by both sides as solution date .
