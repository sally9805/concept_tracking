In case the plan is approved it will be necessary for stockholders to exchange existing certificates without delay for new non-par certificates so as to be in a position to exercise their rights on December 30 , next . After pointing out that the act of legislature of 1912 permits corporations to issue stock without par value , President George B. Cortelyou says in part in letter to stockholders : " The principal objection to the shares having a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representation made in the certificate carries with it the implication that this expresses the actual-value of the share in the property of the corporation represented by the stock , whereas such is rarely the case . The property may he worth more than the par value of its capital stock or it may be le , s . All that a stockholder possesses in any case is such an interest in the entire net assets of the corporation as the number of his share bears to the total number of shares outstanding . By issuing stock without par value the stockholder has the same proportionate interest in the assets and management of the corporation , but there 1. s no longer a misleading statement on the face of his certificate . " The reason for having stock without par value is especially applicable in the case of public utility corpora . tions . The courts have held , with increasing emphasis , that such corporations are entitled to an adequate return on the reasonable value of the property used or useful in serving the public . The value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely in excess of the par value of its capital stock , without reference to the value of the stock of subsidiary companies held by it , so that it is entitled to earn much more than a bare return upon the present par value of its capital stock . These facts escaped the attention of a large portion of the public who are easily mislead into belie . ing that when a company pays a dividend it has no right to pay more than the legal rate of interest on the par value of its capital stock . Much of the misunderstanding in regard to the charges made by public utility companies a sN% ould cease if the consumers were not mislead by the rate of dividend paid upon the par value of the capital stock . " Regarding the new preferred stock issue , Mr. Cartelyou pointed out that the company has always sought the mutual good will and helpfulness of its employes and as a ' consequence has a loyal and efficient body of employes numbering about 20.000 . To further increase this feeling of common interest th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fi ' ? ? , preferred stock at an attractive price which would have the same element of security as a direct obligation , with the additional advantage of a participation in the expected benefits to he derived from increased efficiency and operation . Similar reasons , he added , had influenced the trustees in recommending that some of the preferred stock be sold to consumers on the same terms as to employes
