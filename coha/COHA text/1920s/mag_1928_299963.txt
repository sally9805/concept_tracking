With the wet views of Alfred Emanuel Smith , Premier L. A. Taschereau , of Quebec , is in accord . Said the Quebec Premier last week : " I can not make any actual comment upon any of the planks of the platform advocated by either Mr. Smith or Mr. Hoover . However , I might say that I am not altogether insensible to the reference made by the Democratic candidate to the liquor question . When some of my friends in the opposition in the Legislature offered some bitter criticism at the time the Government introduced the Quebec Liquor Act , I replied that before very long our liquor legislation would be copied by the other provinces . ... I did not altogether expect that the day might come when even the U. S. ... should through one of its great public men pay us the compliment of a reference to the excellency of our law . " The Act provided for the establishment of government-controlled liquor dispensaries.                   @ @
