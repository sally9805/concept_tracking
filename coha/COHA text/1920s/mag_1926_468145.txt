RHETORIC is possibly ? nay , even probably ? of all the sciences ( " arts " if you prefer the Aristotelian epithet ) the most intimately human , the most vital ; since by its aid alone can one man know the hearts and minds of other Men , or reveal himself to friend or enemy . Not the least interesting aspect of rhetoric is that of so-called " usage " : the attitude of a nation or a tribe to a given word , an attitude that shifts and alters as the national or tribal attitude to the thing defined shifts and alters . Often the fate of a word is fortuitous : it falls on evil or good days by accident . Generally speaking , however , the use of a word reflects the spirit of the time , and an investigation of " connotation , " as the rhetoricians call it , is really an excursion into social science . Take , for example , the word " gentleman . " No one except a philologist cares about its derivation , or its adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , who have not had , at some time or other , to meditate passionately and profoundlyon its true significance . There are dramas of which some man 's being a gentleman or not a gentleman is the whole crux , since the solution depends wholly on it . The word , indeed , is not often used lightly . However people define it , they mean by it something significant , revealing , ultimate ; something on which they can base their own actions , stake their own destinies . " Being a gentleman " ( " gentlemanliness " is not quite a synonym ) constitutes moral solvency : a state which makes it possible for other people to do human and social business with you . Yet , though its significance ( on which depends its correct implication ) is immensely important now and then , if not constantly , to all of us , it is extraordinarily difficult to define . Indeed , I do not think it is much discussed . To speak paradoxically , it is too important for discussion . There is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications that we ourselves find resident in the term . Each of us thinks fondly that he numbers no man among his intimate friends who is not ( according to his private definition ) a gentleman . But of course each of our intimate friends has friends whom we should not admit to be such , and we may be sure that we are in like position when our own friends are classified by him . Moreover , we use the term empirically , defining it , if at all , by example . X is a gentleman , and Y is not , and from such statements you must infer what a gentleman is . We all keep a " gentlemen 's agreement " not to call names ; which precludes , as I say , discussion , and , perhaps , complete elucidation . There have been many much-quoted definitions of " gentleman " ; but , so far as I know , no perfect one . Cardinal Newman , we recall , had a famous page on the subject ; and Newman 's tentative definition is as often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " he says , " that it is almost a definition of a gentleman to say that he is one who never inflicts pain . " I remember once hearing a brilliant Englishman comment on this to the effect that Newman omitted a necessary adverb : that a gentleman is one who never inflicts pain unwittingly ; who is never objectionable unless he wishes to be . The proposition covers a lot of cases , but it does not cover the case of the man whose instincts are impeccable yet who may wound people through his fundamental stupidity . Newman 's definition , I fancy we should all agree , is too finicking . We all know cases where a gentleman has inflicted pain , though he may have done it with distaste or regret . How , otherwise , should any of the ends of justice be served ? In considering the term , there is no point in burdening ourselves with foreign definitions . The average Englishman puts into it certain connotations that America can not accept . It is part of our social creed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman , regardless of his social inheritance . We reject it as a class-name . The people who use it as a class-name only are apt to find themselves constantlychallenged . Careful individuals , indeed , are more likely to say " a man of breeding , " or " a man of good family , " than " a gentleman " when they are excluding all moral implications . " A man in whom gentle birth is accompanied by appropriate qualities and behavior ; hence , in general , a man of chivalrous instincts and fine feelings , " says the Oxford Dictionary ; and elsewhere , " A man of superior position in society ? . . often , one whose means enable him to live in easy circumstances without engaging in trade , a man of money and leisure . " Neither definition helps American questioners much . We have no heraldry of our own to determine " gentle birth " ; our heraldry is purely derivative , and if a man brought no coat-of-arms from Europe , he could find none here . The search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly modern in America , and many of the " gentlemen " who came to the New World to found families were careless , if not scornful , of the falcons , boars , and wyverns , salient , rampant , eombattant , that were legally , though mystically , theirs . If an ermine couch-ant with a Latin tag above was supremely important to you , you did not exile yourself to an unconventional wilderness . In the wilderness , anyhow , full of real beasts , heraldic ones became absurd . The griffin bowed to the grizzly . Every man bore arms , whether his remote ancestors had been entitled to or not . As for not engaging in trade , the requirement is as alien to us as the ordeal by fire or membership in a leopard society . That England , too , finds less technical definitions is proved even by Newman . Yet it is true that a man 's class is less easily shaken off in England , and even democratic Americans often reluctantly say of an Englishman that he is not quite a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to become one . Our inaccurate assumption that all men are created equal has the compensatory virtue of permitting a man to assimilate himself to his natural group . There is no one to say him nay , if he can reach it . We have , in the strict , the Hindu , sense of caste , no caste-marks , whereas the British have ; and it is easier for the Englishman to make a fortune or become Prime Minister than to rid himself of his caste-manner , the whole social inflection of his class . II What , then , do we mean by this important , this almost sacred term ? That , alas ! it is difficult to say ; for we mean different things , each according to his temperament and tradition . There are those who mean by it , like Oliver Wendell Holmes , " three generations of portraits in the family " ; there are those who mean by it the habit of literate speech ; others who mean having money in one 's purse , or being able to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually virtuous . The gentlemen who prefer blondes are a different category from the gentlemen who prefer grammar . In some groups it means willingness to put up a fight with your bare fists ; in some it means having a pew in church . I once knew an eminent scientist who had a way of saying ? not simply in the interests of humor ? " a geologist , and , therefore , a gentleman . " And so on , indefinitely . To find a common denominator for the myriad definitions would be well-nigh impossible . Yet I think we can say that to every group the word " gentleman " expresses a certain ideal of masculine bearing . When it is used satirically it is only someone 's else definition that is being satirized ? never one 's own . We can also say , I believe , that in spite of the loosening use of the word , it has never lost its importance . Usually , when a word comes to be used loosely , inexactly , it becomes discredited . " Gentleman " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the people ? agree less than ever on its meaning , yet we do not cease to carry it , as a kind of gauge , inour private consciousness . The same , indeed , might be said , in all reverence , of the word " God , " which has never before been so variously defined , yet never more reflected upon . If few of us can demonstrate God to the satisfaction of the infidel , they are scarcely more numerous who can explain why they consider a man a gentleman . We do not so much know , as apprehend the matter mystically . We do not so much possess a fool-proof definition as realize inwardly whether or not a man satisfies our tacit demands . Curious that we should accept as final an epithet so difficult to expound ! Curious that we should express our ultimate judgment of a man in terms that we can not precisely explain ! Yet so it is . It is not , for most of us , a matter of external manners alone . I can think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as America affords , adequate to the whole gamut of social exigencies , concerning whom I have no information that they have ever done a questionable thing , whom , none the less , I can not bring myself to call gentlemen . I have known , though more rarely , men born with no social advantages and possessed of no innate social gift to whom I should find myself readily applying the term . Nor is it a matter of external morals , though both manners and morals somehow count . Shelley was a gentleman and Swinburne was a gentleman , both much more certainly than Wordsworth or Keats ; yet the balance of morals , as they are popularly appraised , is heavier on the side of the two latter . Some of the best work in the political and social world has been done by men who were not , very certainly , gentlemen ; some of the greatest harm has been done by those who indubitably were . Look at Cromwell and Charles I. It was the gentleman who made the thug necessary . Lancelot 's honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsely true , yet is there anyone to maintain that Lancelot was less of a gentleman than King Arthur ? One can jot down these appraisals with impunity , since , as we were saying , there is no perfect definition of the term , and each man can always retreat behind his own sense of its meaning . For it is a " sense " rather than an intellectual conception . I have called it ultimate , final , revealing ; yet we must admit that there are cases where it becomes useless . I can imagine pedants making out a very pretty case for Shakespeare 's not being a gentleman , or Abraham Lincoln , or Alexander the Great ; though I can not imagine being interested in their arguments . Something in each of these men transcended such classification . It is not , in any case , of much importance when a man is once dead . For you will notice that we use the term less as an appraisal than as a prophecy . In the last analysis , we apply or withhold it with reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have never arisen , than to what he has actually been known to do . It is an expression , chiefly , of confidence . We say more often " He is a gentleman ; he would not do that , " " he is a gentleman ; he will certainly do this , " than he is a gentleman ; he did this . " Though we build up our opinion partly on past experience of a man , we do not hesitate to determine for or against the person whom we have never crucially tested . What it really amounts to , for most of us , is almost the dumb brute 's feeling about a human being . Something within us ? that " sense " we have been referring to ? is the counterpart of the dog 's delicate nose . When we say of a man that he is gentleman we mean that in a trying situation he will act in a certain way ? not always predictable even by us . Not necessarily a pious way , or an intelligent way , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will show us that his instincts perceived immediately in which direction his greatest loyalty was due . The greatest good of the greatest number does not come into it . The gentleman , at the moment when he is proving himself , is not acting " socially . " Being a gentleman , indeed , may make it imperative for him to lie , to steal , even to kill-.though fortunately such exceptional cases belong to fiction rather than to life . He will do none of these things for his own sake , to save his own skin , but it would be ill setting limits to what a gentleman might do to save another 's skin if he felt himself peculiarly responsible for keeping it intact . No : you can not define it . Yet each of us " feels " it , as some individuals " feel " the north . A certain inflexibility is always implied , something in a man that is not to be swayed by tempest or melted by fire ; a certain selfishness , also , an orientation of the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never let you down . Yet , bearing in mind those who have , in their time , been let down by men indubitably gentlemen , I would add that the gentleman has to make his own estimate of any situation , and that we may , deceived by our own egotism , be making invalid claims upon him . It is not our summing up of the evidence , but his , that must control his gestures . Who is to say , except the man himself , where his greatest loyalty lies ? And what is the use of confessing that you can not make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are going to cry out , as soon as you are broken , that it is no omelette ? Calling a man a gentleman is an expression of high faith . " Yea , though thou slay us , arise and let us die . " It is a registered confidence in his judgment , even though his judgment should not agree with ours ; a confidence that transcends information . All of which is flung into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly is not easy . Rarely , rarely , do we have all the evidence . A man who behaved like Sir Galahad last month may , to our poor vision , behave like Dick Turpin , the next . That is why I contended that the term is rather an expression of ultimate confidence than a comment on past behavior . No gentleman has ever lived who has not done things that to some honest person or other may have seemed ungentlemanly . For the days of any strictly defined code are gone . There is not , as there may have been , in a smaller , tighter world , a given set of motions by going through which a man may prove himself . A gentleman , in these days , may even turn the other cheek ; and not so long ago that would have been ethically impossible . No gesture , one might almost venture to say , is absolutely prescribed to-day for a gentleman . We have left the minuet behind , and the best dancers improvise th ei r steps . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it is bad dancing . Those who misuse the term through ignorance of its implications , and those who scorn it because to them it reeks of the old , imperfect centuries , have alike failed to discredit it . That " a perfect gentleman " is apt to be a bounder does not make a real gentleman one . That people who might have been gentlemen have preferred neither to be nor to call themselves such , does not mean that the breed is destroyed . In the heart-searching solitudes , we are hound to come back to it , because even the clever iconoclasts have given us no other way to sum a man up . III There is also the word " lady . " With the utterance , the Crinolines are upon us . Ten times harder , " lady " is than " gentleman " ; and I think we must admit that if " gentleman " is a word whose significance is to be felt rather than expressed , " lady " is a word whose significance it is very hard even to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ours has been a period of really violent transition in the affairs of women . I am told that they still use " lady " seriously in the South . I do not know the South socially , and about it I must hold my tongue . They use it in certain parts of the West , where it is , I take it , an archaism . " Woman " is not , in some sections of our land , thedignified term that it is in others . " Lady " is not a word that my generation ever had much use for . We knew perfectly what our mothers meant by it ; but we were so busy varying and enriching the type that we disdained the limitations of the word . We , too , were ? not so long ago ? the younger generation , and , like all younger generations , we revolted . We did not want to be ladies ; we wanted to be gentlemen ; and when , in intimate talk , we wished to pay tribute to the gallant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called her a gentleman ? not a lady . We were hoping to develop , in our new freedom , some of the masculine virtues , and the feminine term did not cover them . We perceived with disdain that a lady was sometimes capable , for example , of reading other people 's letters ; whereas a gentleman was not . We perceived that ladies sometimes told lies for their own ease or profit ; whereas gentlemen did not . Meredith was the novelist of our revolt , as Wells , I suppose , was the original novelist of the present one . I do not know that our plight can be better illustrated than by the question once put to me by a Princeton professor . Under the honor system , each undergraduate must sign , on his examination , a statement that reads : " ' pledge my honor as a gentleman that in the course of this examination I have neither given nor received assistance . " My ill-natured friend asked me how such a statement could be phrased in a woman 's college . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , would it mean the same thine Her honor as a woman could hardly he brought into it , since a woman 's honor means , traditionally , simply her chastity . My friend ? who is no feminist ? meant , I perceived , to make me unhappy ; and he did . Not because " lady " itself carries no honorable implication ( I am not of the age to love the word overmuch ) but because there is no term as yet to describe the large group of women who arc honorable in the masculine sense . Individuals will not be lacking to defend " lady " in the old sense ; yet theirs is a lost cause . " Gentleman " has often been sneered at by a certain type of pietist because its significance is not ? never has been , and probably never will be ? exclusively moral ; as it has been sneered at by the apologists of awkwardness and " Nature 's noblemen . " The significance of " lady " was never , I think , moral at all ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lost lady a lady , in spite of her more than questionable behavior . Mary , Queen of Scots , was a lady , too , as far as one knows . Being a lady , that is , was a matter of manners ? of those minor manners that have no very profound significance . If her bearing was fine , her heart might be black . She must have tact but , under the bland surface , treachery might lurk . " Lady " loitered behind its period , while " gentleman " was being actively molded by the spirit of the time . A moral element got into " gentleman " long before it got into " lady " ? if , indeed , it ever got into " lady " at all , which I incline to think it never did . The chances were all against a lady 's sinning socially , since she lived and moved within conventions as tight as her own stays ; but there was nothing in her ladyhood to prevent her being furtively mean and quietly disloyal . The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrower sense ) the word still has its uses ; it is shorthand for a whole group of pleasant attributes . But it does not give assurance as to what lies beneath the surface , behind the mariner . Beneath , behind , beyond , may be the wilderness . In so far as morals are a matter of external manners , the lady will be moral . She will not often do things to shock her social group ? therefore , she will usually keep the purely social law . Her selfishness will be wreaked , her blows dealt , in privacy , in such a way that her victims can not complain . An excellent person to invite to a party , but not necessarily to live with . Be it understood , I beg , that I am not saying that all , or most , ladies were , or are , like this ; only that being a lady did not exclude these possibilities . The curious limitation of the lady 's virtues was no doubt an inheritance from darker days , when good breeding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature whom religion , philosophy , and law united in deeming inferior . When Sir Austin Feverel wrote , " Men have rounded Seraglio Point ; they have not yet doubled Cape Turk , " he implied the standard set by gentlemen for ladies in other than sexual matters . Perception of these limitations led our generation to revolt , as I have said , against the use of the word in any but the narrowest social sense . We saw it also becoming absurd even in the social sense . For lady " came very near implying , when we were young , a certain physical context . There were honest activities a lady might not engage in , respectable places where she might not go , gestures of the purest that she might not make , decent costumes she might not wear . She might not act on the stage or work in an office ; she might not go alone into a men 's business district or along any street after dark ; she might not speak to any stranger , or wear bloomers , or refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of these things , she endangered her ladyhood , and for doing each of these one has known women to be refused the honorific term . What cruel conclaves sat in the case of each gentle pioneer ! And if a woman maintained that some unconventionally behaved sister was none the less a lady , she felt the proud glow of the epigrammatist . No wonder the bottom dropped out . For within a few short years ? a decade or two at most ? women rushed into academic , professional , commercial , social , physical liberty , less in the manner of a Roman legion than of a Hunnish horde . It was neither siege nor pitched battle ; it was an undisciplined , irresistible , arrival , at once a seeping and a surge . Briefly , suddenly , they were everywhere , and only prejudice said them nay . They did so many unladylike things all at once that categories shivered and fell . Once a lady could not be a stenographer or a shop girl , and now stenographers and shop girls are almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been welded into the word that even the gold of it was not worth keeping . As there is no gain without some loss , we may as well admit that we have lost something , both actually and verbally . I know plenty of women for whom the old term is no misnomer , and if , to myself . I call them " ladies , " I mean by it something , something , moreover , lovely and desirable . But the term has become curiously useless in dealing with society at large . Virtues and graces have redistributed themselves , re-combined into new types , with new predominances and new emphases . " Lady " always indicated a combination , and that combination , in the youngergeneration , has gone . Young things are differently assembled ; in the finest creature , the proportions are other . Mr. Canby has recently implied , in Harper 's , that the truly modern author can not write a novel about a gentleman , because " gentleman " is rather an historic than a contemporary term . That " gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Mr. Canby says , does not mean that it is not still a. living word , or that the gentleman himself perished with the people who conceived him in a certain way . " Dickens never drew a gentleman " was once a commonplace of criticism , yet according to Mr. Canby , the type was going strong in Dickens ' time . Personally , I have never agreed about Dickens , since I have always held Sir Leicester Dedlock to be a gentleman , but the point has been ably made by better critics than I. In any case , if Dickens never drew a gentleman , it was not because there were not plenty of them , but because he was personally uninterested or incapable . Similarly , the fact that Mr. Wells , Mr. Dreiser , Mr. Lewis , and Mr. Anderson do not ( according to Mr. Canby ) draw gentlemen proves only that they are uninterested in gentlemen , or incapable of drawing them ? not that there are no gentlemen . It might be said , too , that if Mr. Canby knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not declare that Kipling 's gentleman must pass as the public-school mold is broken . While the " public-school type " was in its day a convenient summing-up of certain qualities and defects , there is unstinted evidence in Kipling 's work that he knew it was not the sole synonym for " gentleman . " It is peculiarly dangerous , indeed , to generalize about Kipling , for there is always apt to be something , somewhere , in the vast and varied volume of his work ? no English author since Shakespeare is so parti-colored or so polyphonic ? which confutes any generalization , even the neatest and most timely . " Gentleman , " like " Romance , " is a self-perpetuating term . In so far as is carries implications of character not tribal but truly basic , it keeps , like romance , under changing guises , a residuum of indefeasible validity . Both more plastic and more vital than " lady , " it has a better chance of survival . IV As a middle-aged woman , looking over my acquaintance , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ladies , and that if I had to describe them to a stranger , I should clutch at that helpful term . Yet even admitting my own indifference to the word , I do not find myself applying it carelessly . I once had a cook concerning whom a former employer who was very fond of her said to me , " Z ? is really a lady . " I often pondered it while Z ? was in my household . I thought at first I knew what her former employer had meant ; I decided , after many months , that I probably did not . I wondered in the end if I was not wrong , and the other woman right . Was not my tacit refusal to apply the term to Z ? due to my tendency to import into " lady " for my own satisfaction certain of the moral implications of " gentleman " ? This , although I had known for a long time that to do so is to be rhetorically inexact . " Lady " is ? must needs be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady do a really unladylike thing and still be a lady ? Can a gentleman do a really ungentlemanly thing and still be a gentleman ? Yes , to both questions , no doubt , since no individual achieves the perfection even of his own type . Yet surely ladies may betray their type oftener in the course of a lifetime than gentlemen ; for it is harder for the lady herself to know what being a lady consists in . The social implications of the noun have been shot to pieces in the last decades ; the moral implications were ever undetermined . I like immensely a lot of young women whom I should not think of calling ladies ? they post-date the word . And when I most want to call a woman a lady I hesitate because the word is not good enough for her . The term " gentleman " is probably better left to the men . Women use it , perhaps , more often than men do , and , I daresay , with less chance of accuracy . Women use it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attitude to women , which is no small part of the word 's significance , yet by no means the whole . In the matter of calling a man a gentleman , a woman is more apt to agree with her mother or her sister than with her husband or her brother . We women sidetrack the word , I think , into the channels of our own purpose . There are many cases where class is more important than sex ; subjects more easily discussed and agreed upon by men and women of the same social group than by men apart or women apart , if they have different backgrounds . Sex itself , notably ; and the rights and wrongs of many things . But bring " gentleman " into the discussion , and the sexes are better segregated . " Lady , " too ? only , does anyone discuss " lady " ? Among the many French terms that we have taken over , " grande dame " has had one of the most curious adventures . Our recent puristic tendency to anglicize all foreign words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not ( as so often the native equivalents that the purists find for us , do not ) say quite the same thing . I doubt if " great lady " or " great gentleman " need detain us in this particular bit of social research . They are romantic intensifications , and , like all such , must be sparingly used . Miracles of breeding are as rare as other miracles . Not long ago a woman of my acquaintance , much admired by many of us , referred to another woman ? now dead , and known to me only by reputation ? as a great lady . My friend made out her ease very ably ; and by the time the portrait was built up , out of reminiscence , anecdote , and descriptive phrase , I , too , felt the dead woman to have been , in all probability , a great lady . I doubt if either of us ? the one who knew her or the one who did not ? would have called the deceased woman a lady . A lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than Queen Elizabeth was . A great lady , for example , may be ruthless ; a great lady , in the slang of yesterday , can get away with murder . Shakespeare 's Cleopatra was perhaps a great lady ; a lady , she certainly was not ? any more than her imagined prototype in " The Craftsman " : Saying how at an alehouse under Cotswold He had made sure of his very Cleopatra Drunk with enormous , salvation-contemning Love for a tinker . The great lady may be salvation-contemning : the lady is not . " Great gentleman " we use even more rarely ; perhaps because " gentleman " itself suffices where " lady " does not ; perhaps because it implies an even greater and , therefore , rarer , degree of mundane magnificence . Both phrases are , in any case , as we were saying , romantic intensifications , and romantic intensifications of the franker , nobler sort are not popular at the moment . Nth powers and sentimentalized superlatives are restricted , at present , to the lower forms of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own . Even the Founder of Christianity is being vulgarized constantly in sermons , histories , and fiction . Mr. Thomas Beer ends one of the chapters of his exciting Mauve Decade with the question : " Is it matter for such wonder among critics that only satire can describe this American of our time who drifts toward middle age without valour , charm , or honour ? " Which is as much as to say that Babbitt is the only way in which the modern American male can be expressed . One is all with Mr. Beer in most of his brilliant characterizations , though one would perhaps blame Louisa Alcott 's contemporaries more than poor Louisa herself . That valor , charm , and honor , in the mediaeval , and slightly later , sense , have gone out , no one , I suppose , will deny . Gentlemen according to those definitions would be anachronisms . Romeo and Juliet , Rodrigue and Chimene , find themselves nowadays quite differently situated . The social fabric has changed , and we have become more individualistic . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Mr. Hergesheimer 's Bale of Balisand might be late Minoan instead of early American , for all the kinship the contemporary world can feel with him ; and it is not without significance , I think , that such comments as I have heard on that very interestingnovel have all concerned themselves , not with the remarkable portrait of Bale himself but with the incidental horrors of the " gouging " fight . Yet abolishing the duel , and suppressing the point of view that made the duel reasonable , have not changed everything . " The Titaness " ? whom I loathe quite as much as Thomas Beer does ? has not changed everything . The word " gentleman " is still useful , and , 1 fancy , will continue to be . Three quarters of the human and social situations that our boys and girls must meet are different even from those we met . Public opinion has changed , and public opinion is the arbiter of manners and customs . Yet with all our tolerant perplexity we still mark a difference between the truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not sticking . A great many centuries went to build up the gentleman , with his fortuitous and his fundamental virtues alike . You can not junk a type in one decade or two , or three . And as the gentleman has always had a little way of being " a man of this world , " he was ever capable of evolution . As for " lady , " I have enough faith in my sex to believe that either the word , amended and rehabilitated , will come back to its own , or that a new term will be found . As long as we discriminate at all , some nouns must be set apart to distinguish the people who play the game from those who do not . We may , it is true , disintegrate so far as to lose all power of making distinctions . But in that final blurring of all types , controversy would die , and without controversy we , too , perish . The race is not going to slay itself by drinking either boredom or hemlock.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
