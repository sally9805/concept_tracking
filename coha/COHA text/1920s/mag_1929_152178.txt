George Simpson of Ohio State , holder of the world 's unofficial record ( 9 4/10 sec. ) for the 100 yd. dash , traveled about 1,200 miles to Denver for the 54th annual senior track meet of the National A. A. U. There , waiting to beat him , were Eddie Tolan , little bespectacled Negro from the University of Michigan and Western Conference champion ; Frank Wykoff , defending A. A. U. champion ; Claude Bracey , 1928 N. C. A. A. champion ; Russell Sweet , Pacific A. A. U. champion ; Cy Leland , Southern Collegiate champion . But George Simpson never ran . Two days before the race which somebody christened " the century of the century , " practicing , he sprinted 50 yards , fell on his face . He had pulled a tendon . On the sidelines he stood two days later and watched the others run . <P> There had been sun and heat the first few days in Denver University 's High Crescent Stadium which stands nearly a mile above sea level . But on the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peak . It was evident that Simpson 's record would not be equalled or broken . <P> At the crack of the gun Frank Wykoff , whom Charlie ( " World 's Fastest Human " ) Paddock picked as winner , was first out of his holes . He led at 20 , 30 , 40 yards . Bracey drew alongside him . They were even at 50 yards . Bracey went ahead , far ahead , led at 60 , 70 , 80 . Russell Sweet drew even at 90 , was a foot ahead at 95 . Then out of nowhere appeared what looked like a little black ball . It was Eddie Tolan , 5 ft. 4 in. high , running so low his knees seemed to graze the ground , who hurled himself through the tape , won the windy race in 10 sec. flat . He explained : " I guess I 'm built so low the wind just did n't hit me . " Then he proceeded to win the 220-yard dash also . Herman Brix , Los Angeles A. C. , hurled the 8-lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's record .
