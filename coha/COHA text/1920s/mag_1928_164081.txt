Officially he was on a mission to the French Mandate Of Syria , there to improve the wool yield of native goats by gland grafting , as he has already done with sheep in Algeria ( TIME , Aug.11 , 1924 ) . <P> <P> But at Paris fellow surgeons discreetly discussed a rumor that Dr. Voronoff has gone to the Near East to invigorate a very great patient indeed . <P> It was said that President Mustafa Kemal Pasha of Turkey , called the Ghazi- " The Victorious " - but now somewhat debilitated by incessant , nightly champagne tippling , would confer with Dr. Voronoff in the inconspicuous city of Adana , some 30 miles inland from the southern coast of Turkey . The chief question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lively young chimpanzees which are bred especially for Dr. Voronoff 's convenience in French West Africa by the Pasteur Institute .
