The bulbous hearts of high blood pressure victims chirked up last week with hopes that a cure , at least a palliative , for their malady had been devised . <P> High blood pressure , a disease mainly of old age results from many causes-riotous living , too strenuous athletics , brain fatigue , disease , any undue strain on the human corporation . To repair damage to worn or fatigued tissues the heart works harder to pump cleansing , healing blood . Normally the arteries-flexible , elastic , contractile tubes springing directly from the heart as the great aorta and ending far away as tiny arterioles-expand as the blood enters them , then contract progressively to push the blood onward to the ends of the body-to the brain , the vitals , the tissues of the heart itself , the limbs , the skin . From the terminal arterioles tiny capillaries suck this blood into venules like tiny , feeble fountains trickling foul blood back to the heart . This venous blood the heart pumps into the lungs for the filth to be burnt there by inhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs the blood returns red to the heart , which starts it again through the arteries . <P> In normal people expansion and contraction of the heart and the arteries go on without effort in perfect team play . But when the heart-in the worn-out or sick- must push the blood in abnormal amount or at too great speed through the arteries , these stretch , lose their elasticity , their contractile powers . They thicken in spots : thin in others . Them too the blood tries to heal ; brings serum to weak spots , serum which turns gelatinous , gelatine which hardens , calcifies . The arteries become ropy , then hard like the stems of clay pipes . The patient has hardening of the arteries . <P> A stroke of apoplexy or a fit of angina pectoris is horrible to see , infinitely more horrible to pass through . The victim counts himself as captured by Death , thenceforth a tolerated thrall . A docility comes upon choleric , domineering men ; an apathetic quietude rules their minds and bodies . They must be quiet , cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood vessel . <P> To such forced idlers last week came a flickering hope expounded by Dr. W. J. MacDonald , surgeon and physiological experimenter , of St. Catherine 's , Ontario , before the Toronto Academy of Medicine . For seven months Dr. McDonald has neglected his practice to work in the laboratories of Toronto University under the guidance of Dr. J. J. R. Macleod , skilled inspirer of students , keen biological chemist , co-discoverer with Dr. F. G. Banting of insulin , hope of diabetics ( TIME , Aug. 27 , 1923 ) . <P> Drs . MacDonald and Macleod have crushed beef livers ( from healthy two-year-old animals ) , let serum rise from the maceration , filtered , titrated , decanted the serum , got a whitish grey fluid which they injected into the muscles of men suffering from high blood pressure .
