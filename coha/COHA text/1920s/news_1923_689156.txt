txt Margin between cost of production and net sales realization on all sizes of anthracite was figured by the Coal Commission at $1.05 a ton for the fourth quarter of 1922 and at $1.07 for the first quarter of 1923 . This was under most favorable conditions . These figures are before deducting interest on investment , federal taxes , dividends or reserves for surplus . Operators claimed during the negOtiations last year that all of the miners ' demands , which were much the Same as those now being considered , would mean an added burden on the industry of $140,000,000 , which would be over $3 a ton on a 53,000,000-ton production of domestic sizes . The wage demand increase of 20% of itself , it was contended , would amount to over $1 a ton on the domestic sizes alone . Wage demand for day men this year is $2 a day advance as against $1 demanded last year which would considerably increase the forgoing figures . On the subject of cost of distribution , the commission found that retailers ' margins ranged from $3.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following : " About a third of the output of anthracite is mined under leases in which the operator pays the landowner a royalty . The royalties collected on fresh-mined coal range fromlas low as 12 cents on old flat-rate leases to as high as $1.50 a ton , on percentage leases and on certain stripping operations the rate is even higher . The royalty rate of the Girard estate leases for 1921 averaged $1.27 a ton on all coal mined , 2,983.723 tons . As the Girard lands are in the Schuylkill region where mining costs are relatively high and the percentage of ' domestic sizes relatively low , they are intrinsically less valuable than the lands in sonic other Parts of the region . The high royalties of the Girard estate thCrefore suggest the profit that inures to the more fortunate operating companies simply in their capacity ns landowners . For where land is held in fee , the mining company 's costs arc lower by the difference between the depletion charge and what they would pay as royalty if they were lessees , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAY " Producing interests stress the opportunity for earning a living wage in the anthracite industry , and quote the report to this effect wherein it is set forth that of those who avail themselves of the opportunity to work the year round , the income for a family of five ranges from $1,500 to $2,000 . Some exceed this ; many fall below it . " Those who take full advantage of their opportunities to earn in-the various occupations connected with the industry and are not handicapped by serious misfortune need not suffer for shelter , food , clothing , or other decencies atd comforts of life , even without suppleMentary earnings of wife or children . " Without mentioning directly the check-off system , which is one of the demands of the minors , the operators point out this paragraph in this commission 's report as being adverse to the check-off and closed shop : " The principles that a man has legal right to work free and unimpeded by threats , duress , coercion . or restraint , when , where and for whomsoever he chooses ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he plcasep ; and that men have a right to bind themselves together for collective bargaining touching wages and working conditions are freely admitted by everyone . These principles honestly lived up to would keep the open shop and at the same time permit the existence of the union . "
