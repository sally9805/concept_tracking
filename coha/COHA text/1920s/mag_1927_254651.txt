Had they been interviewed , some people who figured in last week 's news might have related certain of their doings as follows : <P> David Belasco , play producer : <P> " Equipped with crackers , a bottle of milk and a play for reading , I was speeding in my limousine down Manhattan 's Riverside Drive in the small hours of New Year 's Eve last week . Biff , crack , splinter-clatter-the glass of the windows broke about me as another car , revelers within , ran head on into mine . Five stitches had to be taken in my eyelid , and my head is bandaged over other cuts . The New York Herald-Tribune , perhaps to increase sympathy , reported me as ' in the seventies ' ; I am 67 . " <P> <P> Maria Jeritza , prima donna : <P> " Teddy , coal-black boiler room cat at the Metropolitan Opera , last week momentarily disrupted a performance of Turandot . As the curtain rose for the third act , Signor Lauri-Volpi , my stage lover , was disclosed supposedly asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him across the stage . Box-holders jerked their opera glasses into position . Others opened wide their eyes . There was tittering , laughter and one great solemn guffaw . Teddy prowled on . Lauri-Volpi rose to sing . The audience roared . I , offstage , about to go on , had hard work to keep the severe demeanor of the cold Chinese princess . Signor Lauri-Volpi shooed . I called . Teddy came . " <P> <P> Ganna Walska ( Mrs. Harold Fowler McCormick ) : " Belgrade , 950 miles distant from Paris , is the capital of Jugoslavia . There I , earnest singer , appeared in the title role of Tosca . I stabbed the Baron Scarpia of the piece so vigorously that I broke my stage property knife . I got five curtain calls , and was pleased with this tribute to me , after my unkind treatment in the U. S. ( TIME , Oct. 26 , 1925 ) and my recent failure to secure a stage in Paris , even after buying , as I thought , an opera house for myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onetime ( 1909-13 ) governor of Missouri : " Ill , I was unable to deliver my speech at a university club luncheon in Kansas City , Mo . But the mayor read aloud what I had written , including my endorsement of President Clarence Cook Little 's ( University of Michigan ) plan to minimize the importance of college football by having rival universities prepare two teams apiece . Let them be called , for example , the Red team and the Blue . Let only Red meet Red and Blue meet Blue , a game at each college on the same day , ' thus making it unnecessary for students to leave their own school to witness a football game . ' " <P> Charles Gates Dawes : " ' That would be assuming , ' said I last week over the telephone to a news-gatherer who asked me to say something to the U. S. people for New Year . ' That would not be modest , ' said I next , to a proposition to wish them a ' Happy New Year . ' The persistent fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year . ' Happy New Year , ' said I.
