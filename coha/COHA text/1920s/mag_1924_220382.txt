Filling the afternoon air with a droning roar , racing speedboats plowed foamy furrows up and down the Niagara River at Buffalo . Chief plowhand was Commodore Gar Wood of Detroit . Guiding Baby Gar IV , he won three straight 50-mile heats and a leg on the $5,000 Fisher-Allison Gold Cup . Baby Gar IVs average speed for the 150 miles was 42.06 m.p.h . Rainbow , owned by S. B. Eagan of Buffalo , plowed home second ; Nick Nack , owned by Humphrey Birge of Buffalo , third . Nick Nack finished second to Baby Gar III in 1922 , at Hamilton , Ontario , and was awarded a protest that Wood 's boat had an airplane engine . This year Wood 's secret of success was carrying fuel enough for non-stop heats .
