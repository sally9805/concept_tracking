txt Here in California , where Herbert Hoover is expected to win his greatest victory in any of the States , they are arguing as to where the Republican nominee stands on prohibition . Everybody admits he is dry , but is he " bone dry , " some of the disputants ask , or is he inclined to be " reasonable " as to what is or is not the point at which liquors are intoxicating ? Saturday , just before Mr. Hoover delivered his speech of acceptance , a close personal friend , whose status approached that of spokesman , declared that what Mr. Hoover wanted was the facts and , once they were available , legislation in harmony with them . The Hoover war library is a part of Stanford University , and a part of its war records are originals , or copies , of every letter Mr. Hoover wrote as Food Administrator under President Wilson . The letters , said a friend of the candidate , quite accurately give Mr. Hoover 's point of view on the liquor question . Letters Show Stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES . They show that Mr. Hoover was for national temperance in 1918 , but that he opposed stopping the brewing of beer of less than 2.75 per cent . alcoholic content . At that time Mr. Hoover declared it would be " mighty difficult " to get drunk on beer the alcoholic content of which was not in excess of 2.75 per cent . Then there was a vast supply of whiskies , gins and other spirituous liquors in the United States , and there was no law by which the sale of such liquors could be stopped . Hence , in the interest of temperance , Mr. Hoover opposed putting up the bars against the brewing of beer . Mr. Hoover , in June , 1918 , said : " If the American people want prohibition they should prohibit by legislation to that end , and not force the . Food Administration to the responsibility for an orgy of drunkenness . " About the same time Mr. Hoover addressed a letter to Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas , the author of the prohibition amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance situation as it then existed . He called Mr. Sheppard 's attention to the fact that he had been a lifelong advocate of temperance . His Reply to Senator Sheppard . In the letter to Senator Sheppard , which bore the date of June 4 , 1918 , Mr. Hoover said : " My dear Senator : I am greatly obliged for your letter of June 2 , enclosing copy of letter which you received from the President , upon which you ' ask for some comment from me . " I have the feeling that the form in which the Food act stands makes temperance issues and food conservation issues incapable of separation and in sharp conflict . You will recollect that the provisions of the Food act of Aug. 10 , 1917 , provide five types of operations in connection with the liquor trade : " First  --  The immediate stopping of the distillation of liquor . " Second  --  The authority to commandeer any distilled spirits for redistillation so . far as may be necessary to provide alcohol for munitions requirements . ' ' " Third  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preparation of wines . " Fourth  --  The authority to rem:late the . use of foodstuffs in brewing beers . " Fifth , the authority to prohibit the use of foodstuffs entirely in brewing . Cites Big Liquor " Under the first authority distillation was stopped on Sept. 10 throughout the country , and there has been no use of foodstuffs since that date for this purpose . There proved to be in stock , at the time distillation was stopped , somewhere between two and three years ' supply of whiskey , brandy , gin , &c.,; and this stock is in coarse of distribution , as the act provides only for the stoppage of new supplies . " Under the second authority the War Industries Board found no necessity for commandeering distilled spirits in the country for redistillation into munitions alcohol , and I am informed by them that there are technical difficulties in the way as well , as the fact that commercial alcohol can be obtained not only abundantly but on a much cheaper basis than could be had through commandeering and redistillation of potable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken . because the wines produced in this country are from grapes , of which a very small proportion are available as table or raisin grapes , and , therefore , the stoppage of wine making would add no consequential amount of food to our national supplies . The conversion of vineyards to other production would not be likely so long as there is prospect of resumption of wine making at a later date . The conversion of these grapes to grape juice instead of wine , as suggested , would add nothing to our National food supplies . ' " Under the fourth authority , with regard to brewing , the alcoholic content in beer was reduced to 2% per cent . and the amount of grain and other foodstuffs that could be used has been limited to 70 per cent . pi-that-4nd- during . the ! corresponding period of the previous year , the effect being to stop any expansion of brewing and to reduce the foodstuffs consumed by 30 per cent . " The actual amount of grain being used in the brewing of beers is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which approximately 30 per cent . is recovered as cattle feed , and the loss therefore into the beer is practically the equivalent of 3150,000 bushels per month , the grains used being barley , corn and broken rice . " There is , of course , a great deal of contention that the beer itself contains the remaining food values , but omitting this the cessation of brewing would effect a saving in grain of apnroximately 3,150,000 bushels a month from a nutritive point of view . It needs no comment from me , from a food point of view , that I should favor the saving of this amount of grain . Would Nt Ban All Brewing . " Under the fifth authority  --  that is , the stopping of brewing altogether it does appear to me that there are temperance issues involved of such tremendous moment that they outweigh the use of the reduced amount of foodstuffs in brewing and in any event give ground for a difference in judgment as to the alternative national risks and losses which needs the most careful consideration . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liquor trade within one or two months and the whole country would be put practically on a whisky , brandy and gin basis , with some supplies of wine . " The saloons would be left open and upon a basis of selling drinks carrying 40 per cent . to 50 per cent . alcohol , with some small supplies of wine , instead of a large proportion of their customers being served with a drink of 2% per cent . alcoholic content , and , therefore . from a temperance viewpoint much less harmful . " It raises the very serious moral problem as to whether infintely more damage will not result from such action than in a continuation of the use of this limited amount of foodstuffs in brewing . It does not appear to me that the losses in food are entirely secondary to the moral and - physical dangers , The President 's letter indicates his feeling in this particular . " You are probably aware that I have been a lifelong believer in national temperance ; on the other hand . as a purely administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should not enter into any contentious matters , and can only compromise this situation pending definite action by the American people , or by Congress , to whom the ultimate responsibility in such questions belongs . " Saw Danger in Liquor Stock . The following day , June 5 , 1918 , Mr. Hoover issued the following statement : " As to the discussion over the suppression of brewing , I wish to say emphatically that from a strictly food conservation point of view I would like to see the use of foodstuffs suppressed in all drinks , hard and soft . This is not , however , the whole story . " We stopped distilling a year ago . There is a long supply of whisky , gin and other 20 to 40 per cent . distilled drinks in the country . We have reduced the consumption of foodstuffs in brewing by 30 per cent . and reduced the alcohol content of beer to 2% per cent . " If we stop brewing , the saloons of the country will still be open , but confined practically to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of national efficiency in these times will shrink from this situation , for the national danger in it is greater than the use of some 4,000,000 bushels of grain monthly in the breweries . " If the American people want prohibition it should prohibit by legislation to that end , and not force the Food Administration to the responsibility for an orgy of drunkenness . It is mighty difficult to get drunk on 2% per cent . beer ; it will be easy enough if we force a substitution of distilled drinks for it . " The Food Administration has gone as far as it can toward temperance without precipitating a worse situation . If the American people or Congress will stop the sale of distilled liquors. the Administration will find no difficulty in stopping brewing . " These statements Indicate the posi. - tion of the Food Administration under Mr. Hoover up to Sept. 21 , 1918 , when the Administration announced that from that date no malting of grain would be permitted for the purpose of brewing beer or so-called near beer . Friends of Mr. Hoover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are proof of the dryness of the Republican candidate . His position then is little different , they contend , from the position he has taken in his candidacy for the Presidency . Mr. Hoover has made it plain that in this campaign he will do no " free " talking . Instead he will speak through official statements and in public addresses , although he probably will discuss the prohibition issue many times . The nominee secluded himself today in his study to work on the speech he will make at West Branch , Iowa , his birthplace , next Tuesday evening . That will be the most important utterance on his journey East and will deal largely , it is understood , with the farm problem . On the next day , Aug. 22 , he will confer with farm leaders , who are to meet him in Cedar Rapids , Iowa . Mr. Hoover will leave here Thursday night . His itinerary calls for stops ranging from ten minutes in Arizona , New Mexico and Kansas towns to the longer ones in Santa Barbara , Cal. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedar Rapids he will proceed direct to Washington , being due there about 8:30 P. M. Friday , Aug. 24 . Telegrams congratulating the candidate on his speech of acceptance continue to arrive . Among messages given out today were those from William R. Willcox , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee ; Adolph Lewisohn , J. Will Taylor , Republican leader of Tennessee ; Samuel S. Koenig of the New York County Republican Committee , and Louis Marshall . With the exception of Mr. Taylor all are from New York City . Mr. Willcox wired that the speech had made a profound impression in New York , while Mr. Lewisohn described it as one of the greatest utterances of recent years . Mr. Marshall called it an example of exalted patriotism . Mr. Koenig said the speech was universally commended in New York City . He also referred to Mr. Hoover 's " courageous stand " on prohibition , and added that New York State would rally- behind the ticket on election day .                @ @ @ @ @
