Whoopee . " Here is another of Mr. Ziegfeld 's sumptuous durbars , a large and glittering ceremonial with Mr. Cantor at the comic centre of its parades . . . . The celebration earns the right to be called magnificent . ... He ( Florenz Ziegfeld ) employs the expensive Eddie Cantor . . . the prodigal Mr. Urban . ... He inspires the lazy silkworms to weave new and fabulous fabrics . . . . " - Percy Hammond in the Herald Tribune . <P> " It is almost too well done . We become satiated with an excess of splendor . Let these ladies see to their makeup . . . . How it is to be cut down I can not imagine . ... I ... I have seen ... I ... I ... " - St . John Ervine , in the World . <P> " Carnival time has come again to the New Amsterdam Theatre where Mr. Ziegfeld 's first production of the season was produced last evening . . . . " -J . Brooks Atkinson , in the Times . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziegfeld gathers his bards . . . . The swiftest , most lighthearted , loose-limbed show for miles and years around . . . . " - Gilbert Gabriel , in the American . <P> " Dear Flo Ziegfeld : . . . What , my dear Flo , is your secret ? . . . Thank you , my dear Flo Ziegfeld , for the musical comedy the town 's been waiting for . . . . " - Robert Garland , in the Telegram . <P> " Of course you do run out of Ziegfeld adjectives after awhile . . . . Why not just call them ' Zigs ' ? queried he . . . . " - Burns Mantle , in the Daily News . <P> " The peer of all spectacle sponsors , the paramount figure of America 's entertainment impresarios , the amazingly adroit F. Ziegfeld . ... It is swift , sure and steadily sparkling . It is better described as one of the grandest things Mr. Ziegfeld has ever done . He is truly a great man , this Ziegfeld . This reviewer . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a superb evening . . . . " - Walter Winchell , in the Evening Graphic . <P> With these perfervid paeans the drama-reviewers of Manhattan let it be known that they had caught Whoopee , a cute little musical show , starring Eddie Cantor and exposing to view large portions of Gladys Glad , Olive Brady , and the like . <P> Singing Jailbirds . To Author Upton Sinclair , it seems that the lack of charity with which rich men deal with poor men is a novel wickedness , separate from the other beetlish wars which people wage among themselves . He sympathizes with the poor men and writes tirades in their favor , damning " capitalists . " Such a tirade is Singing Jailbirds which was acted last week by the New Playwrights Theatre . <P> It appears that the incident with which Author Sinclair herein expresses his rage actually occurred in San Pedro , Calif. , in 1923 . Strikers were imprisoned and when imprisoned they were compelled to stop singing their " wobbly " songs . By sentimentalizing this repression , and by causing his hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming dementedly of the scenes of his life , Author Sinclair has concocted a tract which will bring cheers only from those who agree with him . <P> For , though Em Jo Basshe has done well with his direction , and though a Broadway cast brings a welcome efficiency to the stage of a Greenwich Village theatre , the play never touches reality .
