A N Irish Free State at last ? It seems incredible , unbelievable , a myth conjured up by age-long desire . Yet there it is , a miracle if you please , but a miracle won by the steadfast devotion of a people through seven hundred years . Belittled , ridiculed , abused , often starved and always enslaved and oppressed , its leaders have dreamed their visions even as they stood on the scaffold 's trap , dying with absolute faith and certainty that some day the new light would shine . So here it is , dearly enough purchased , Heaven knows , but irradiating the whole world ! No single event in generations has done so much for real peace and goodwill , particularly between England and America . And with it the embattled and oppressed everywhere are quickened and uplifted . This ultimately will mean freedom for Egypt and for India . It will stiffen the resistance of the Chinese to foreign outrage and set men everywhere to realizing anew that no moral issue is settled until it is settled right ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seek it but desire it with all their hearts ..  --  But it is not the Irish only who are to be acclaimed . To Lloyd George the congratulations must be unreserved . The old , Liberal , pre-war Lloyd George has spoken here and it is enough by itself to entitle him to immortality . Moreover , it is in the best tradition of English , progress  --  so often honored in the breach , yet flashing always from time to time , as in the Milner report on Egypt  --  now , alas , marred again by those spoil-ails , the soldiers . Some will say it is the hand of the opportunist Lloyd George again , that with thiS success  --  if it goes through  --  he so rivets his hold uyion his office that he could not resist the play . Sometimes it is worth while to have an opportunist in office  --  that is , it is better to have one than a ' rock-ribbed reactionary whose prejudices never change . More often than cynics think what is expedient is also what is right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can only note what wonderful thing he has done for England and the world and praise him without any qualification whatsoever . He must have his due and if it means a new lease of power for him it is well worth the price . While The Nation has never had any doubt from the beginning of the negotiations that hostilities could not be resumed again , that peace must be the result , no one could have been prepared for the patience and skill Lloyd George displayed and his strategy in handling the Ulster situation . Ulster is no longer the imperial stalking-horse and the unsocial bigotry of her Orangemen has at last been made clear for all men to behold . The religious issue now sinks into its proper place and into a true relationship to the whole . It is for Northeast Ulster to say whether she will play by herself or be a part of a nation which we believe now has within it the promise of great achievement for all mankind to profit by . Feeling thus we can not believe that the opposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation will prevail . For Mr. De Valera we shall always have the profoundest respect and gratitude ; in his modest intrepidity , his calmness and gentleness , his readiness at all times for prison walls if need be , we have found a true approach to the heroic . It is but right , perhaps , when he has so often declared that he stood in all sincerity not for dominion status but for a free republic , that consistency alone should make him refuse his assent ; we know that nopersonal ambition or selfish motive could sway him . But we can not at this writing believe that his view will prevail . One step at a time , and this step spans the centuries ! To banish at one stroke every last abominated red-coat from Erin ; to see every hated and blood-stained black-and-tan take ship for England ; to have Ireland receive the right to her own army ; to see her in control of her ports at last and of her trade , able to put on her own tariffs if she see fit , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agreement to negotiate on an equality with Britain as to regulations for the control of the air  --  surely , - this together with religious freedom for all sects , is enough of glorious revolution for one generation , enough to justify and guarantee one long breathing-spell . Then , if after decades the arrangement does not work , if necessary modifications can not be achieved , if the demand for even greater self-expreSsion is not to be downed , if a separate language and a separate entity call unanswerably for complete independence , it will as surely come as-has by Heaven 's ( mercy the Free State , and that , too , we believe , without so desperate a struggle . For human dramas often move as irresistibly as Greek tragedies but not always to tragic ends . When Gladstone failed and Parnell died , it seemed as if Ireland were lost . Had not John Bright himself , one of the greatest of Liberals , defeated home rule believing neither in that nor in a Dublin Parliament ? The social and financial powers that were then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no explanation for any other opinion about Ireland than their own save " moral turpitude and personal degradation " ? a painful demonstration , as he wrote , " how thin after all is our social veneer even when most highly polished . " What hope was there ? Even Morley and Gladstone had believed , prior to the Home Rule Bill , in coercion and arbitrary force as the remedy for Ireland 's disease , the Great Commoner himself actually imprisoning Parnell and many others for months and months without trial or even formal accusation . At best he advocated but a limited extension of home rule with a probably entirely unworkable Parliament and he- insisted on British control of the police . No wonder that men have exclaimed until now that Ireland seemed the sport of a destiny that was aimless . But the blood of the martyrs has been the seed of a state , and David has once more triumphed over Goliath . Gladstone was right , if inconsistent , when he declared , while he kept liberty-loving Irishmen in jail , that " it is liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made - their own government astonishingly effective despite the presence of armies of occupation can be trusted to work out their own destiny . The links of cooperation forged - in the bitterness of oppression will hold fast in prosperity . We can not believe that the Irish fire will die to ashes now that the Irish task is no longer to win freedom but to use it gloriously . We look to see Erin 's arts flourish side by side with teeming trade in her now bare but glorious harbors . We look to see a literature all her own , with the Celtic temperament brimming over with wit and sentiment , with pathos and mirth and happiness , celebrating , in closer and closer spiritual union with England , the glory of the peace which surely to every Irish home will seem that which passeth understanding . A Farmers ' Strike ? T HE last wheat and corn crop in the United States sold far below cost of production , and there is widespread and serious suffering in the grain country as a result . The outlook for next year is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sowing of adequate crops another season ; acreage is going to be cut down . Several remedies for this situation have been suggested . The first is the advice of the old school to let " economic law " take its course . This means a smaller crop next year and a wiping out of at least part of the big surplus of the last two seasons . But the returns on a smaller crop next year , even at the somewhat higher prices that could be expected , would not put the farmers on their feet . There will be more bankruptcy and more suffering . This means the abandonment of still more acreage in the following year and a gradual drift from thei country to the cities . This drift cityward will continue until crops have become so small as to send prices skyward again . President Harding , in his addresq to Congress , has come forward with a second proposal to assist the farmers . In glowing terms he advocates cooperative marketing . This is an excellent suggestion , but why it should be made to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one form of farmers ' assistance which farmers must accomplish primarily by themselves . The practical difficulty with cooperative marketing at the present moment , however , is that it is necessarily something of slow growth  --  too slow to meet the immediate need . Moreover it requires considerable capital on the part of the participating farmers , and this is just what is lacking in the regions that most need help . Another proposal is more novel . It is for a farmers ' strike , at least among the corn growers of the Central ? West . This suggestion originates with Wallaces ' Farmer , published at Des Moines , Iowa- . This is the organ of Henry C. Wallace , Secretary of Agriculture in President Harding 's Cabinet . The idea is indorsed by other conservative farm journals , such as the Nebraska Farmer and the Prairie Farmer of Chicago . It is proposed to reduce acreage in the corn belt by at least 25 per cent . According - to Wallaces ' Farmer , business men and bankers will be asked to assist the plan by bringing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will be asked to stop credit to those who do not reduce their acreage . A reduction in the corn acreage of 25 per cent is considerably more than - would normally follow the recent low prices , and it is estimated that it would raise the- price of corn in 1922 to a point where there would at least be no loss to the growers . The spectacle of Wallaces ' Farmer and other " respectable " farm journals advocating a strike among agriculturists is remarkable . Unlike the press of the National Nonpartisan League , these journals have not encouraged cooperation between farm and city workers  --  between farmer organizations and labor unions . They have condemned strikes on the part of union labor . If it has no other result , the propaganda in favor of a farmers ' strike in the corn belt will at least help the agriculturists- of the region to understand that there is sometimes no remedy but to strike . But what will President Harding say , in case his administration takes action against labor unions , when these organizations point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in favor of strikes , and that , too , inso basic an occupation as the production ? of food ? Wallaces ' Farmer seems to realize some inconsistency in its position , for it says : " The policy of restricting production in order to secure an excessive profit is a vicious one . And farmers never have practiced and never will practice it in the same heartless way the italics are ours as certain other classes of society . " The " economic pressure " to be brought to bear upon farmers to influence them in favor of the corn strike is hinted at in Secretary Wallace 's paper as follows : In the South , bankers , business men , and politicians are so firmly convinced that their welfare fundamentally rests on the price of cotton that they all join in wholeheartedly to make the cotton acreage campaign a success . The bankers in many cases are of especial help , because they refuse to stake those men who do not cut their acreage by at least 20 per cent . Will the bankers and other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity as clearly as these Southerners ? Finally , there is a fourth suggestion : revival of the Grain Corporation with the powers which it had during the war . This idea is sponsored by A. C. Townley , president of the National Nonpartisan League . In its behalf Mr. Townley points out that the Grain Corporation was created to keep the price of wheat down . When the price had actually mounted to $3 a bushel during the war , the Grain Corporation - set it at $2.20 . ? Mr. Townley thinks that if the Grain Corporation worked so well to keep the price of grain down , it can be made equally efficacious to keep the price up , so as to insure cost of production plus a reasonable profit to the farmer on the 1922 crop . But would the Grain Corporation find it as simple to keep the price of wheat up as to keep it down ? - If there were only the domestic consumer to consider it might be possible . Then the Government could buy and sell the wheat crop at its own prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff levied for the benefit of the farmer . It would be open to the same objections as a duty intended to protect the manufacturer . Moreover , the problem of export would seem to constitute an insuperable difficulty . The Government might fix the price of wheat at home but obviously not abroad . The result would be that the Grain Corporation would have to sell abroad at the market price , and make up the difference out of government revenue , or else it could not sell at all . Now , if the Government did not sell at all abroad , it would not only fail of its duty toward Europe but the home market would be glutted with a surplus useless for- anything except fuel . Such a course is clearly unthinkable . The other alternative  --  that of selling abroad for - less than at home and paying the difference out of taxes  --  would involve the Government in a speculation too vast and uncertain to warrant trial even if the publiC would undertake to finance it . The farmer will probably have to extricate himself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted . He will have to realize and fight for his group interests just as organized labor has had to do , often in opposition to what we fatuously call " public welfare . " If the realization and the fight lead eventually to an alliance with organized labor , it will mean progress for both sides  --  and incidentally an approach toward a truer public welfare than that usually in the minds of those - who so glibly make use of the phrase today . The Four-Power Treaty O N the face of it the Four-Power Treaty which was so promptly adopted by the Washington Conference makes for peace , but in diplomacy things are not always what they seem and this new treaty must not be accepted , if at all , without the closest scrutiny and most careful consideration of what it is , how it came to be , and what it may involve . Its ratification would have manifest advantages : ( 1 ) It ought to hasten the independence of the Philippines , to which we are morally committed , by depriving our imperialists of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japan or England would gobble them up ; ( 2 ) the treaty contains the excellent provision that in the event of disputes between any of the four parties to the treaty , the questions at issue will be referred to a joint conference of all four nations for discussion and adjudication ; ( 3 ) the treaty does away with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance ; and ( 4 ) it decreases the danger arising from disputes over Pacific islands in general . Unfortunately this is not the whole story . There are dangerous features of the treaty which would seem to outweigh its advantages : ( 1 ) It confirms for the signatory Powers their title to spoils which at one time or another they acquired by force or trickery  --  in particular , it may bar Russia from recovering her part of the Island of Sakhalin ; ( 2 ) the pact ought to include as signatories Russia and the Far Eastern Republic of Siberia ; ( 3 ) there is a dangerous hint of force in Article 2 which declares that if the rights of any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the high contracting parties shall communicate with one another fully and frankly in order to arrive at an understanding as to the most efficient measures to be taken jointly and separately to meet the exigencies of the particular situation . Against such dangerous ambiguities in future years the verbal assurance of Senator Lodge that there is no provision for the use of military or naval force is vain . At least a definite affirmation that the United States hereby commits itself to no act of force or war is imperatively demanded . But the most serious objection to haste is that this treaty cannot. be rightly understood until we know what terms will be embodied in the proposed nine-Power convention as to China . If that convention should prove a thieves ' agreement , the adoption of this treaty can but strengthen it , for it is impossible to believe that the four great Powers can be allied in matters pertaining to the Pacific without having that alliance effective in matters pertaining to China and Siberia . In reality this treaty is simply a modified AngloJapanese Alliance and a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else , made it necessary for the British to abandon the alliance . They could do it gracefully only by substituting a pact to which the United States was a party , and if we are rightly informed it was this arrangement which they first sought . Mr. Hughes refused to be a third in such a treaty , but agreed to be a fourth with France . If France was added , why not Holland with far more at stake ? Shall we be told that our fears are groundless and that the whole American press approves this pact ? So were we told when The Nation stood out against the madness of Versailles . Now , as then , it is necessary to appeal to the sober second thought of America . The United States of Christmas SUPPOSUPPOSE , now , we organized a genuine league of nations SE , and called it the United States of Christmas . It is true that Christmas customs vary a great deal among the countries which might be asked to join the federation , but they vary about as little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of any other scheme we have yet heard of ; and in addition the Christmas customs generally agree in a habit of good-will which would be an asset . Certainly Christmas has been a potent festival . Origen , ascetic creature , ' thought that keeping the birthday of Christ treated him " as if he were a king Pharaoh " ; yet under Justinian the celebration had grown so popular that there were riots and soldiers necessary in Jerusalem when the related feast of the Epiphany had its date changed to match the new date for Christmas . And we all know what happened when Christmas invaded Britain and hit upon the happy coalition with the pagan " mothers ' night " which still survives . Give Christmas a fair chance and , in our opinion , it would spread as much farther as it has spread already . It is true that there might be some question among the African and Asiatic races as to why they should join in honoring a day sacred to an alien religion , but here the answers would be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Christmas is not so very Christian as all that : it has a multitude of pagan elements which fit almost any disposition . And then it might be pointed out that the League for which we propose this substitute has not taken the African and Asiatic religions into account in every article . No , the non-Christian nations would be at least as well off in the United States of Christmas as they are - now , so far as their religions are concerned . Moreover , they would surely gain from a touch of benevolence in the compact . Who would make a better President of Christmas than St. Nicholas the Open-Handed ? He comes originally from Holland , which invented the Hague Conference . He has a very satisfactory dominion in the United States , which has all races in it . The Commonwealth of Great Britain , scattered through its seven seas , could understand his genial dialect . Germany would recognize his tree . Russia of the late Czar and of the present Lenin would see in Nicholas 's name something not foreign . The Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , the Latin nations have no one to nominate who would do better . Turkey , Persia , India , China , Japan  --  there the machine-guns or the missionaries will have to do their part . Let them remember how Ferrovius , the pious blacksmith , wrestled with his convert : " The next morning his hair was white , but he was a ChriAtian . " Let them study how Thangbrand the priest swung the Bible and the battle-ax in Iceland till there were none left but those who were willing to observe Christmas . There is even a dim possibility that these robuster methods could be dispensed with . Peace has a fire in its heart that kindles wherever it comes . Kindness has been known to conquer enemies whom no rage could frighten and no tyranny oppress . Very hard hearts may be melted with affection , when hands reach out sincerely asking for forgiveness . After long chaffering men have sometimes learned that honesty procures what all the craft in the world can not procure . " Gifts often buy more than guns or gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
