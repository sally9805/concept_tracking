SOUTHERN CHARM-Isa Glenn - Knopf ( $2.50 ) . There are few more ludicrous members of the U. S. population than the garrulous women who stray from rustic homes below the Mason &; Dixon Line into the complicated excitements of Northern metropolitanism , there to stand , like cats in the rain , meowing about their cousins , Southern courtesy , and Robert E. Lee . These women are a small class ; but they are a class which may be stamped upon vigorously , with the hobnailed heel of satire . <P> Isa Glenn writes about four such women ; one is Mrs. Habersham , who , as she approaches old age , is entirely concerned with matters of sex which she should have outgrown ; Mrs. Habersham resides with her elder and married daughter Alice May , who is stupider , prettier , lazier than her mother ; visiting Alice May are her two aunts , Sallie and Natalie , both quite credibly prurient and unattractive . The entrance of Laura Habersham , Mrs. Habersham 's second daughter , who has so far forgotten her Southern breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strikes her mother , sister and aunts like an unaccustomed cold douche . The demure plot of Southern Charm consists of the anticipation and then the actuality of Laura 's arrival . But Author Glenn does not overlook the element of charm that prevents her female Southerners from being monsters . This is perhaps because she was born in Atlanta and has herself strayed Northward , not to meow , but to chuckle .
