THERESA-Arthur Schnitzler-Simon , Schuster ( $2.50 ) . <P> " Theresa was just sixteen years old , that spring . . . . " Theresa was soon seduced ; then she left the country and went to be a governess in Vienna . Before long she had a bastard by a rascal called Kasimir Tobisch ; when the child was born she wished to kill him in her agony and sorrow . Instead , she sent him to live with some country people and went on being a governess . Lovers came to her again and she accepted them : Albert , who had loved her long ago ; Richard , who thought that she was " too good for him , " slept with her friend and committed suicide . Her son grew up to be a sneak-thief ; to have him with her she rented furnished rooms and started to give lessons . For one of the girls who attended her classes , Theresa came to possess a deep and sacrificial love ; it appeared that she was to marry the girl 's father but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , unhappy , and growing old . Franz , her son , had by this time become a pimp and jailbird ; he came home to his mother only when he wished to take money away from her . Finally , she refused to let him have any more . Then Franz , whom she had wished dead , strangled her . Albert came to see her in the hospital where she lay dying . Theresa said to him : " He has only repaid what I did to him . They must not punish him too severely . " <P> That is the end of " the chronicle of a woman 's life , " the first full length novel which famed Austrian Arthur Schnitzler has written for 20 years . The book moves slowly with the pace of life in language that is bare and beautiful . Author Schnitzler does not blame Theresa for her tragedy , nor does he blame the circumstances which compel it . He merely understands that these things are a part of life , and writes about them seriously and gently .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
