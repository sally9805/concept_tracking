txt Many thousands of visitors come annually to the Boston Navy Yard to see the tamous old frigate Constitution . Her ancient bulwarks. her muzzleloading twenty - four - pounders , with which she battered the Tripolitan forts in 1804 and four British warships in the War of 1812 into submission . and her lofty spars and- rigging . are of perpetual interest , contrasted as they are by the lines and batteries of the modern steel warships which keep her company from time to time at the , levy Yard . These visitors carry away with them a new amisselation of what Americans of an earlier and less secure day did upon the sea . The sight of this beautiful old ship instills a deeper reverence for the dignity and beauty of American ideals and also for the Constitution for which she was named . The country is about to lose one of Its most glorious patriotic shrines. for the old ship is fast rotting to pieces . A move is on foot to restore her to her original stanch condition . not for active service but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gained for the American people forever in 1812 . A brief review of dramatic history ' will show why she is thought to be worthy ' of restoration by the American people . who will be asked to contribute pennies , dimes and dollars toward a fund for her preservation . The U. S. S. Constitution is one of the first three frigates launched for the United States Navy . She was authorized by Congress in 1704. or 181 years ago , and is still flying the American flag . She was launched and named Constitution in 1797. ten years after the Constitution of the United States had been adopted . No greater mark of hope and confidence could have been bestowed on a ship than this , for it meant that Americans had the same faith in her to protect and to represent them that they had in the Constitution itself , a faith which she nobly justified by a victorious and honorable career In war and peace for more than a century and a quarter . During this period . she participated in forty actions without defeat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all parts of the world the United States flag as an emblem of justice , good faith and freedom . Her services in the War - of 1812 , in which she defeated successively the Guarriere. the Java , the Cyane and Le- 1 vant , and forced the British to send squadrons instead of single ships in search of her , had a profound effect on our national existence , for they came at a time when we were being badly beaten on land and when it looked as though the new American nation was about to break up through secession bred by partisan politics and general discouragement . Something more was needed than the political appeal of the Constitution of the United States to bring the sectional interests of the several States together . The first victory of the frigats Constitution , that over tha OuerriAre in 1812 , supplied what was needed  --  a national pride in a national achievement . An American frigate named the Constitution met and utterly destroyed a crack frigate of the acknowledged Mistress of the Seas , old England , whose cruisers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warships of European nations whenever they met them . The Constitution herself was scarcely damaged in this action . so cleverly was she sailed by her American captain and so well was her battery served by American gunners . Few sea fights have been so decisive in such a short time . So unusual was it for a British frigate to strike to an enemy that at first the whole naval world was dumb with amazement . To the despairing Americans the news of this victory , followed by her succeeding victories , came like a clarion call to have faith in themselves as a united American nation . From that day the soul of the nation found itself and the dormant seed of political unity sprouted into the sturdy oak of Union which weathered the storm of secession in 189/ . The frigate Constitution is old and honeycombed with decay . It will soon be necessary to strike down her tapering spars , remove her old muzzle-loading guns and to tow her to some mudbank , there to rot away , a mute reproach to Americans who should appreciate what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in 1833 , when Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote " Old Iron ' sides , " arousing the patriotic instincts of the nation in her behalf , and again in 1874 , when a still grateful country rebuilt her a second time . Fifty-one years have passed away since then . It is time for her third rejuvenation , not only to preserve her as a beautiful reminder of the days of sails and spars. but also as a symbol of our faith in the Constitution itself as a perpetual heritage of the American people . The school children of the country are asked to start the ball rolling ; $500.000 is needed . or about 3 cents from every school child in the country . Many patriotic friends are expected to help these children . The Secretary of the Navy is authorized by Congress to accept contributions for this purpose . Th. , Society of the United States Daughters of 1812 are sponsoring the campaign , with the help of other patriotic societies and influential men . A treasurer to receive contributions has been appointed . Every cent collected will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign are voluntary . The commandant of the Navy Farr. , Boston . will be glad to give all informs . tion possible about the Constitutiois. which lies at the yard waiting for that day when the I-00.000 she has so well earned is available to start work on her .
