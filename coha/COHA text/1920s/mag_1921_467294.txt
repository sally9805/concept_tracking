OLD ! Yes ! but what do we mean by " old " ? Probably there is no other question that could be raised for which it is more difficult to find an authoritative and conclusive answer . Whatever testimony we may call , there must he always a suspicion that the witness is not quite disinterested . For has he not , nolens volens , a personal stake in the inquiry ? If , as a preliminary , he be asked , " How old are you ? " ? and mark , such questions are always put in terms of " age " ? we do not say , " How young are you ? " or , " What is your youth ? " but , " How old are you ? " and , " What is your age ? " ? well , if the witness answers , " Twenty , your worship , " it is a foregone conclusion that the attainment of thirty years will be what he means by " old . " " After thirty , " wrote one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all life is a mere repetition . " If , on the other hand , a person of eighty be called to the stand , we shall find ourselves even farther away from an answer , for no person of eighty ever owns up to being " old . " And , indeed , it might with reason be contended that the attainment of that age is a mode of youth . A robust and green " eighty " might be called a masterpiece of youth . Nothing is more delicate and sensitive than this matter of age , nothing so painfully presses on the nerve of one 's amour propre . It almost looks as though it were a disgrace to be " old , " so desperately do we all avoid and disclaim the imputation . The situation is rather pitiful , and difficult for all concerned ; not least for considerate and well-mannered irouth ? that " youth , " I mean , about which , alas ! there can be no argumentvhose dilemma occasionally in presence of chronological seniors is apt to be comically distressing . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has referred to a third party as an " old fellow . " " How old , my dear ? " comes the implacable , jealous inquiry . Poor youth ! how it blushes and flounders and makes things worse ! " 0 quite old . " " Yes , but how old ? " " Well , about . . . about . . . fifty . " Fifty , you foolish child ! Surely you do n't call filly old ! Of course not ! It was an idiotic slip of the tongue . But it is too late ; the damage has been done . Unintentionally , the kind heart of youth has planted an arrow in the heart of the chronological senior ; yet , at the same time , it goes on wondering to itself . . if fifty is not old , what on earth is ? Mr. W. B. Yeats tells a charming story of a wandering Irish poet who , footing it , blithe of heart , along the country roads , comes upon a girl sobbing , face down , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble ; and , between her sobs , she replies that her mother intends marrying her to an old man , because he is prosperous , because of his large potato-patch , etc . And she begs Hanrahan , whose voice she recognizes , to curse him in a song . The poet , quite willing , asks " the number of his years , " that he may put them into his song . And then , turning her tear-filled eyes upon the poet , she answers , " 0 lie has years upon years ? he 's as old as yourself , Hanrahan ! " And poor Hanrahan goes upon his way , exceeding sorrowful , for up to that moment he had been thinking of himself as still quite a young fellow . Had not his heart been full of song up to a minute or two before ? No doubt another poet felt the same way when they brought a young maiden to cherish him ; but the thoughts of Abishag the Shunamite on David the King are not recorded . Still another poet , Goethe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother of little Ulricke Lewetzow , still in her teens , refused consent to their marriage , though the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar pleaded the suit of his youthful friend . After all , Goethe could dance with Ulricke as actively as any young man . Was that being old ? Not to speak of his writing the second part of " Faust " at eighty-two . Long before Goethe , Sophocles had given similar evidences of " youth . " Was he not lovesick for young Archippa ? and , when his son sought the jurisdiction of the court to have him placed under guardianship for senility , what a victorious answer he had ready to his hand in a chorus of the " Edipus at Colonos , " which he had just written ? at ninety ! Ninety , you foolish child ! Surely you do n't call " ninety " old when a man of ninety can write like that ! And so it goes . Concealment of age is , of course , part of the immemorial business of women , as also in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , depending upon " the public " for their livelihood , such as actors , actresses , musicians , and writers . A consultation of contemporary biographical dictionaries reveals the suppression of the birth date in certain cases ; and such a " disgrace " is it , sometimes , for popular favorites to grow " old , " so much a part of their stock in trade to remain immortally " young , " that it would not be surprising to hear that the unauthorized publication of their true ages might come under the law of libel , as being detrimental to them in the practice of their professions . What is the meaning of this universal fear of growing old , or , worse still , of being regarded as old ? Has it , indeed , any sensible meaning , or is it not rather a superstition , a form of hypnotic suggestion , to which we become subject almost before we have begun to live atall ? For it is by no means only those who are technically " middle-aged " or " old " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed twenty to feel the chill shadow of this threatening disgrace . The debutante and the freshman already wrinkle their smooth brows with anxiety on the subject . Already they have a feeling that no time is to be lost if they are to make a success of their lives ? and the implication in both cases would seriously seem to be that they have but up to thirty to succeed or fail . After that . . . well , nothing matters . Now , if this nervous impatience were founded on history and biography , it would be easy enough to understand . If all history had been made by men under thirty , and all great lives had attained their crescendo at that early age , there would be no wonder in boys and girls being thus disquieted at the swift passage of their twenties . Some remarkable history has indeed been made by famous individuals under thirty , some immortal poetry , some immortal music . There is no need here to recapitulate the proverbial precocities of fame . Yet all great rulers and generals did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor all politicians as Chatham and Pitt , nor all poets as Byron , Shelley , and Keats . In fact , these and such names are merely the exceptions which prove the rule ? that history and " greatness " have been , for the most part , the business of men who neither made the one nor achieved the other till they had passed , and , in most eases , far passed not merely their twenties and thirties , but even their forties , fifties , and sixties . The destinies of the world at this most portentous crisis of its history are certainly not in the hands of men under thirty . In fact , the one " youngster " who has been intrusted with any important participation in their control is sixty ? that is , General Pershing ; and he , I understand , is considered very " young " for his position . Yes ! even now in this most " modern " of all epochs it is " the elders " to whom we turn for counsel and guidance , exactly as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise old men , who , though their bodies might be but a precarious bundle of bones and their - voices as those of grasshoppers , yet retained in that mysteriously important part of them called " the brain " a long and varied experience of men and things and the mutations and vagaries of time , and a wisdom for applying that experience , combined with an authority to enforce its conclusions , which , so far , have not been found in the possession of young gentlemen under thirty . Therefore , if it be a desperate sense of the need of achievement which so early intimidates " youth " with the menace of " age , " it is evident that mere ignorance of history accounts for its alarm . A wider knowledge of " the best that has been thought and done in the world " would bring it the reassurance that , while certainly the youngest of us has no time to waste , there is , all the same , lots of time left after thirty to be " great " in , and that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late to be ambitious . " The history of mankind teaches that " youth " and " age " share achievement in common , but that the preponderance of achievement is far from being on the side of " youth . " Therefore , in any attempt to define what we mean by being " old " ? or " young " ? we must eliminate achievement . Other matters and characteristics are common also to people under thirty and over eighty . People of eighty are frequently near-sighted , even blind , also deaf , bald , or gray , and they often walk with difficulty . Yet there is no need to be eighty to attain these results . Every one of them is far from seldom achieved by people under thirty . If they are to be considered signs manual of " age " they must also be considered signs manual of " youth . " Besides , they do not pertain to all people of eighty , among whom , in every generation , may be counted many who suffer from none of these disabilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , wherever these disabilities are found , there we have " age " ? but that is quite another point of view , and a very important one , to which we shall have later to return . " These tedious old fools ? " exclaimed the young Lord Hamlet . But how about the tedious young fools ? The same poet has declared that " crabbed age and youth can not live together " ? but the implication that " age " is always " crabbed " and that " youth " is always easy to live with is far from being borne out by human experience . As a matter of fact , so-called " old people , " granted certain original graces of nature , are much better day-in and day-out companions than the green and callow , undeveloped , unweathered , strident , petulant , domineering , pathetically confident and omniscient , radiant absurdities whom we indiscriminatingly honor and flatter by the name of " youth . " The more one ponders the matter the more difficult it is to see what special qualities or characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , or its patronage of , " old age . " Of achievement , as we have agreed , it certainly can not claim the monopoly . Nor , as we have seen , can it claim exemption from those bodily ills common to all flesh . What then can , or does , it claim as its own peculiar possession to justify its arrogance or to support its confidence ? Is it beauty ? But does it always possess beauty ? Are all boys and girls , all young persons under thirty , beautiful ? Are there no beautiful old men and women ? The beauty of bloom and smooth skin is one beauty . But there is a beauty of line and furrow and wrinkle , a beauty made by time and storm , " a beauty wrought from within upon the flesh , " with which the mere animal-like beauty of " youth " can not compare ; the beauty of great old fighting-men , of great old priests , of sacred , distinguished , old grander dames . The face of Lord Byron is beautiful ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newman ? And while many women , born beautiful , such as Ninon de L'Enclos , have grissvn more beautiful as the number of their years increased , most of us , while we have known women of whom the same is true , must also have known many who have achieved in age a loveliness of which their girlhood gave but little promise . It would , therefore , seem that as " age " has no monopoly of deafness , baldness , tediousness , and so forth , " youth , " in like manner , has no monopoly of beauty . Indeed , the more one strives after a definition of what we mean by being " old " the more it would appear that " youth " is little else than what Sir Thomas Browne would call " a naked nomination , " a mere chronological term , unclad with any qualities special to itself ; that , in fact , it consists in being " sweet and twenty , " or sweet and twenty-nine years , eleven months , thirty days , twenty-three hours , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere matter of the calendar , a mere mathematical formula . That we should have thought other-. wise , credited it with potencies and enchantments by no means peculiar to itself , is largely the fault of the poets , the hypnotism of literature . Literature , indeed , is the very pander , the paid press agent , of youth . It has seldom a good word to say for age in any language , and its standards of " youth " and " age " are not infrequently grotesque . The learned rano rated all persons between forty and sixty as " seniors , " and here he is at one with the good Sir Walter , who writes of an " aged woman of fifty , " and handles the soldierly Guy Mannering of forty or so as tenderly as though he were a patriarch . In this regard , indeed , novelists are depressing reading . They must be especially so for women ; particularly Russian novelists , whose forte is to be depressing under all circumstances and conditions , and whose serious business seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first rules , then , of that art of not growing old is the repudiation of most literature dealing with so-called old age , all its pessimistic and mortuary commonplaces . We must resist , too , the hypnotic suggestions of social tradition and refuse obedience to those conventions which , taking count only of the number of our years , would insist on one adopting elderly and senile attitudes and fashions as yet entirely inappropriate for us . All gray hair is not the same . There is much gray hair on young heads , particularly in America , where , indeed , that frequently most becoming cranial adornment has the look of the stately powdered wigs of our forefathers , where the humane fashion of not wearing one 's own hair after adolescence did much to equalize the generations , gave people over thirty an extended span of " youth , " and prevented the confusion of a bald head with decrepitude . Any society leader who would reintroduce the fashion of wearing wigs would do a great service to his and her fellows ; for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gray hair should be allowed to misrepresent us ; as , for example , the loss of one 's front teeth in our early years , as not infrequently happens , would do were it not for the reconstructive skill of the dentist . Youth does not consist merely of sound teeth or raven hair , and the arts of the dentist and wig-maker are not arts of disguise , but arts of truthful presentation . They enable us to appear not younger than we are , but merely as young as we are . With no few people , their crude tenements of clay often treacherously misrepresent the youthf ul tenant ; and , therefore , women who are essentially as young as their daughters are within their human rights in taking all convincing means of advertising that charming truth to the world . At present the conventions deny to men such methods of combating that superstition of chronology , and this , in the business world , is a serious matter , where to be over forty is often a serious handicap , and to be over fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ye who enter here . " On the other hand , much ox what I have called this physical misinterpretation comes of a depressed acceptance of those false notions concerning youth and age ; for the body is a very sensitive recorder of the inner life that mysteriously dwells within it , and to think old is soon to look old . Young thoughts go a long way toward making young faces . Properly understood , " youth " is merely another name for vital force . It is that fiery principle within us which animates our whole being , developing it , broadening and intensifying it , making it stronger and finer , a more and more perfect instrument of living . We have but to tend this fire as we would any other , see that we provide it with its proper fuel , for it to go on burning with an even steadier and whiter flame as the years pass . Swedenborg 's well-known saying that in heaven we grow ever younger has a profound truth for even those of us who have not yet got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon sod , under sun , " where " from flesh unto spirit man grows , " if we may believe Meredith , we may put STedenborg to the proof by the determination to grow toward youth , instead of away from it . The merely chronologically young know little better than babies what to do with the divine fire which burns within them , " Confusions of a wasted youth " are the result . How they waste and cast to the winds this elixir vita ' , prodigally spending in a few ignorant years their treasure ? like a savage throwing gold pieces into the sea , laughing to watch them sink with shimmer and gleam , or as a madman burning down his palace to watch it flame . Yet to be " niggard of one 's youth " is not wisdom 's way , either ; for , in regard to youth as with so much else , the more we give the more we have . But how to strike the balance between prodigality on the one hand and parsimony on the other is a branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows instinctively and for which it is impossible to formulate directions . It is far indeed from my purpose here to perpetrate one more of those hypocritical , distasteful paradoxes with the flattering unction of which " old people " are so often indulged ? and insulted ; such well-meaning vulgarity as assures some lovely grande dame that she is " eighty years young , " or jocosely slaps some splendid veteran on the shoulder and asks , " How is the young fellow feeling to-day ? " So-called " old age " has no greater indignity to wince under than such impudent euphemisms of the inbred person who really means that they are as good as dead and buried , and merely go on living by the sufferance of " efficient " blatancies of coarse health and vigor like himself . ' That " old age " is a fact I do not , of course , attempt to deny , but what I do deny is that it comes automatically and inevitably by the mere attainment of a certain number of years . Take the case of an oak-tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad and mighty , with innumerable stalwart branches and a great canopy of fresh and rustling leaves . It has been growing where it stands for over a hundred years , but the sap rises as irresistibly within it as ever and its topmost twigs tingle with energetic life . In terms of time it was " younger " when it was a mere lanky sapling , newly sprung from the acorn ; but was the spirit of life within it anything like so prosperous or victorious as now , when in its hundredth year its multitudinous greenness shelters a thousand lives of bird and squirrel , and when its broad roof spreads a vast mothering shade for hot and sleepy herds ? As a fire burning in a grate is bigger than the match that set it alight , so the fire of youth in this " old " tree is mightier than that which animated that lean young sapling which once swayed and shivered in the wind . If by " old " one means that it has gone on victoriously growing , adding strength to strength and freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously , no objection to the statement , but if , on the other hand , you mean by " old " that it is decayed and withered and has lost all its " efficiency " as an oak-tree , one has only to look at it to perceive the contrary . It will be time enough to apply the word " old " to it in the condemnatory sense when some of its boughs begin to show black and leafless amid the thinning green or when its trunk is split and hollowed . Meanwhile it remains mightily young , young as the morning which it greets with its huge freshness and the music of its swaying nests . This is no merely fanciful illustration . It is with men and women very much as with oaks . Their span of life is indeed shorter ? in spite of literally " youthful prodigies " such as the famous Thomas Parr ( 1483-1685 ) , who married again at a hundred and twenty , and lived to see the child born of his marriage attain the ripe age of thirty-two . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in men as in oaks ? may well he crescent to within a very few years of the time when , as the sword outwears its sheath , it must go seeking another " envelope . " Youth is a quality , a spiritual energy , and , properly speaking , there is no " old age , " but spiritual decay . " The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew " is no valid evidence of growing old , any more than to lose a leg in battle . Fussy physical activities are not the only tests of youth . That brain of Sophocles which , as we previously recalled , gave us his greatest play at ninety , is more to the point , as also that famous saying recorded of him , in reference to the cooling of the passions with the years , that to grow old was like being set free from service to a band of madmen . Because we grow wiser and stronger , less selfish , and generally more useful to our fellows with the passage of the years is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only means that we have learned how to employ it . We do not run in every direction as we did . We know a little better what we are doing , or what we want to do ; but the motive force that enables us to do it is that same energy which once drove us to make fools of ourselves at the beginning , and still provides the same " swift means to radiant ends . " Decay , disillusion , weariness : we mean these things when we speak of " growing old , " but we fail to realiZe that these are no necessary accompaniments of the years . We may , unfortunately , inherit them , or acquire them , like bad habits , or through neglect of a proper care and exercise of our spiritual selves . Spiritual and intellectual laziness makes most people " old before their time . " If we lose interest in life , life will soon lose interest in us ; and it is just as possible to achieve a precocious senility in the twenties as at any later period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first impulsive aspiration : He had but to reflect a moment or two to realize what price his garnered middle age would lose by exchanging itself for that " twentieth spring . " Indeed , who would be twenty again when they can be eighty ? as some wonderful people know how to be eighty ?
