txt " HEALTHIEST CITY . " The Claims of Seattle to American Pre-eminence Presented . To , the Editor of The New York Times : People of the Pacific Northwest , who ' have regarded THE NEW YORK TIMES as a sort of keystone of journalism , were surprised to read in the Jan , 15 , 1922 , issue a headline , " New York Healthiest City in the World , " and a story written by Royal S. Copeland , Health Commissioner of New York City , giving New York as the healthiest city . The undersigned is a native of New York , but has lived in the wonderful Puget Sound country thirty-six years . The readers of THE Times in the Pacific Northwest would like to see THE TIMES maintain its reputation for accuracy by printing the following information , which is taken from official Government figures : The healthiest metropolitan city in the United States is Seattle . Government figures on the average annual death rate for the fifteen years from 1906 to 1920 in cities of the United States having a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthiest city . During that fifteen-year period the average annual death rate in Seattle was 9.78 per thousand population . The nearest rival was Portland , Ore. , with 10.75 , then St. Paul with 11.54 , and Minneapolis , 11.58 . New York 's rate was 15.83 , contrasted with Seattle 's 9.78 . Babies born in Seattle have a better chance to become adults than if they were born any . place else in the United States , show the same figures . The official Federal summary of infant mortality rates in forty-three cities for 1920 gives the following number of deaths of babies under one year of age for 1,000 births : Seattle 51 New York 85 Philadelphia Milwaukee 91 Buffalo 101 Boston 102 Baltimore 106 Pittsburgh 108 Fall River , Mass 134 Dr. Woods Hutchinson , in his book . " The Conquest of Consumption , " wrote : " When once we cross the summit of the Cascade Mountains we enter a country of green mountains , of dazzling snowtipped peaks , of grass , of moss , of fern , which knows neither the barrenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ? The most restful and soothing climate in the world , the land where ' it is always afternoon , ' the ideal home for the blond races upon this American continent , and not half appreciated yet at its full value . " While appreciative of what New York has done along the lines of prevention to reduce the death rate , it is believed that THE New Yoak TIMES in the interest of accdacy should tell its readers what American city is the'most healthy . C. T. CONOVER . Seattle , Wash. , Jan. 28 , 1922 . Los Angeles Climate . To the Editor of The New York Times : I hope you wo n't feel too badly in regard to the criticism of A. R. Ogden in quoting what Dr. Copeland had to say about Los Angeles temperature in Tits NEW TOSIC TIMES of Jan. 20 , but having resided in Pasadena all of 1921 and in that time visited Los Angeles several times during the Summer , I feel that Dr. Copeland did not exaggerate when he stated that the heat was excessive during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain why The Los Angeles Times during the Summer always quotes the temperature of Los Angeles Harbor , which is twenty miles away from Sixth and Main Streets , the heart of Los Angeles  --  very much as if THE NEW Yost ; TIMES quoted the temperature at Sandy Hook instead of ' limes Square . In closing would state that it is very unusual for any one to walk twenty-five miles with the temperature ranging between 99 and 106 in the shade In Southern California unless he IS trying to get away frnm something disagreeable . G. T. TAYLOR . Pasadena , Cal. , Jan. 25 , tsr.s : . Kenyon Appointment Constitutional ? To the Editor of The Neu , York Tinter : Is not the appointment of Senator Kenyon t ' ) the United States Circuit judgeship in the Eighth Circuit unconstitutional ? Section 6 of Article I of the Constitution provides as follows : - " No Senator or Representative shall , during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the authority of ' the United States , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been increased during such time . ' Senator Kenyon has been a member of the upper house for some ten years and during that period the salary of the circuit judges has been increased from $1,500 to eti , 500 . The question is an important one , for it may affect the validity ' of decisions of the Court in which he is appointed to sit ; hence , immediate publicity should be given to the objection raised , before the Senator goes through the form of oualification . DRURY W. COOPER . New York City , Feb. 1 , 1022 . Lenin at Genoa . To the Editor , of The New York Times : Lenin at Genoa 's economic conference  --  is n't it a. little bit like asking a mad dog to attend a doctors ' consultation as to a sure cure for rabies ? JOAN BENEDICT . Brooklyn , Jan. 31 , 1022 . NEWSPAPERS AND HISTORY . Approves Times 's Articles on Mr. Wilson . To the Editor of The New York Times : I do not know whether you receive so many commendations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record my hearty endorsement of your publish- , ing so much valuable material about our recent history . Mr. Tumulty 's book shed much new light upon the great work of Mr. Wilson during the most . critical years of world history since the days of Napoleon I. And now comes tile exceedingly important material of Mr. Ray Stannard Baker . These historical writings do not commend themselves to . many of the leading newspapers of this country , and they do not reprint or syndicate them . Their editors ? do not know how much they and the country owe Mr. Wilson . They will not know . It seems to me to be a courageous thing in a New York paper to publish such material , in view of prevailing prejudices . Courage is a good thing to have ; sometimes it pays . I hope it pays THE TIMES . It certainly pays the country  --  and it 's your country as well as mine . I hope you will continue to publish from time to time bits of . history or documents like Baker 's , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us shall be enlightened , even against our wishes . WILLIAM E. DODD . Chicago , Jan. 30 , 1922 . International Justice Court . To the Editor of The New York Times : In your Issue of Jan. 31 In making use of a " release " of the League of Nations News Bureau a wrong impression was given In referring to tile Permanent Court of International Justice as being the accepted court of eighteen nations . The court is the creation of the fifty-one States members of the League of Nations , the representatives of whom participated in electing the Judges . You confused the compulsory Jurisdiction of the court and the membership therein . It may , therefore , be interesting to your readers to have the facts set forth . ' Membership in the court , as distinguished from the privilege of electing its Judges , is acquired by signing the protocol of Dec. 16 , 1920 , which at the present time has been done by forty-five States . This protocol is to be ratified by tile Governments and ratification has been given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia , Austria , Belgium , Brazil , Bulgaria , Canada , China , Cuba , Czechoslovakia , Denmark , Finland , France , Greece , Haiti , India , Italy , Japan , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Rumania , Serb-Croat-Slovene State , Siam , South Africa , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , ? United Kingdom , Uruguay and Venezuela . The following States have not yet completed the processes of ratification : Bolivia , Colombia , Costa Rica , Esthonia , . Latvia , Liberia , Luxemburg , Panama , Paraguay , Persia and Salvador . In addition to the compulsory Jurisdiction accepted by all signatories for specified types of cases , an optional clause providing for general compulsory jurisdiction was attached to the protocol of Dec. 16 , 1920 , and at the present time has been signed ? ratification not being required  --  by the following eighteen States : Brazil , Bulgaria , China , Costa Rica , Denmark .

New York Dispensary Appeal . To the Editor of The New York Times : The New York Dispensary , founded in 1790 , Is the oldest dispensary in New York and the second oldest in the country . Since its foundation , the dispensary has been physician to more than four million . Last year 114,1331 patients were treated at the dirdensary , 925 quarts of milk were given to babies and patients needing extra nourishment , and Medicine was given free to those who could not afford to pay the small fee . Seldom in its history has the New York Dispensary felt that it needed to adopt more than the usual methods of seeking contributions . This year , however , we shall face a very serious financial condition . Apart from a small endowment , we are entirely dependent on voluntary Contributions . We are not supported by the Hospital Fund , the Red Cross . nor do we receive any financial aid from the eit:S . Your help is urgently needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foster , Treasurer , and sent to the dispensary in enclosed envelope . JOHN A. , Chairman of Finance Committee , The New York Dispensary , 34 Spring St. New York , Jan. 31 , 1922 . Milton as a Prophet . 4'o the Editor of The NctO York Times : The article in yesterday 's TIMES telling about the extraordinary experiments of Professor learlgoule of the University of France in developing a sense of sight through the skin of the " hopelessly blind , " and his initial success , calls to mind the lament of Samson over his blindness in Milton 's " Samson Agonlstes , " in which occur the lines : " Why was the sight To such a tender ball as tile eye confined , So obvious and so easy to be quenched , And not , as feeling , through all parts dif-fused That she might look at will through every pore ? " May not this passage be classed as one of the " deep presentiments of the powers of science " ? to use a phrase of Emerson 's ? B. M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Asquith 's Talk . To the Editor of The New York Times : Mrs. Herbert Asquith is only the latest of a long line of English visitors who have come to America persuaded that American audiences will be content with allusions to or trivial anecdotes about personages in England . Some of those who received the extremely meagre fare Which she offered to her first great audience at the New Amsterdam Theatre yesterday , went away not only hungry , but convinced that had she chosen site could most easily have given us exactly what we wanted . Let Mrs. Asquith try the experiment of speaking to her American audiences as she would talk to a man whom she respects , to Viscount Grey or to Lord Morley , and she will make a conquest which is worth the making and change thousands of mere curiosity seekers into appreciative hearers . HELEN GILMAN BROWN . New York , Feb. 1 , 1922 . Liszt 's Concerto Pathetique . To the Editor of The New York Times : In Mr. Aldrich 's criticism of the New York Symphony Orchestra program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above concerto has ever been played here in any form . The anncuncement of the orchestra 's program stated that it was given for the first time . I should like to say that I heard Liszt 's Concerto Pathetique given by the Thomas Orchestra and played by Raphael Joseffy on the evening of . March 10 , 1886 , at the Academy of Music . The orchestration was by Reuss-Liszt . This must have been before this work was urranged far two pianos , as on the same program appears the Mozart concerto In E flat for two pianos played by Joseffy and Samuel Sanford , so presumably the Liszt work would hive been played for two pianos It it had existed in this form . ?

To the Editor of The New York Times : The recent theatre disaster in Wash . ington calls attention to a danger that 1 Is always present in New York  --  one never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great loss of life unless means are adoptod to prevent . That is i ? the use of revolving doors in buildings with an enormous population . . ( ? Imagine what might occur in an office building containing two or three thou.t. sand people if an explosion or fire should ' , Cause a panic . From a dozen directions people would rush to the exit . The slightest clogging of the doors would render them absolutely worthless and in a. moment people would be piled to ; the height of the doors in a struggling mass , every moment growing more dense ;  --  and there would be no remedy but the smashing , if possible , of the heavy and frames , with resultant loss of life ? perhaps too late to be of avail . The writer , to verify the difficulty of throwing back the revolving doors flat in the frames ( as they are built to do ) . requested an official in a Broadway office building to show how this was ' . done . In spite of the fact that there ; were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it impossible to throw back the doors , on account of the orderly persons always involved in the I various leaves of the doors , in less than two minutes of ' precious time . One can imagine the impossibility of effecting this in a panic with thousands of frenzied persons rushing at the exits in endeavor to escape . The door mechanism can be worked only when the doors are at perfect rest , and two distinct operations are required . One Broadway office building contains 14,000 persons . Many hold thousands each . The danger is a real one , and the matter deserves serious attention . - Because no such calamity has occurrea is no reason to neglect the danger now . Let some one propose to install revolving doors as the sole means of exit from theatres and moving picture houses ! It is easy to see *hat would be the-fate of such a suggestion . Is it not equally dangerous to have such doors in buildings with double the population of a theatre audience ? They are simply fire traps in disguise . It . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roof Suggestion for Theatres . To the Editor of The NM York Timers : The appalling theatre tragedy in Washing . ton last Saturday evening points to preventive measures . A simple suggestion 00-curred to the . Why should not a mechanical device like the go rden sprinkler , known to me es " Jupiter Pluvlus , " which sprays lawns by the , hour at a minimum cost of water and labor , he applied to roofs of houses , substituting hot water for cold ? With the first snowflake this could be turned ion at half pressure to warm the roof gently , and turn the accumulating snow into water at once , and prevent such unneceasary and frightful tragedies . M. L. MANNING . New York , Feb . I , 1922 . Schools for Seamen . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your article with reference to the proposal by Colonel Forbes , Director of the Veterans ' Bureau , to establish a number of schools where the returned soldiers vibe now are without employment , or with none that satisfies their IleW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared to enter the merchant service as sailors or as officers , was read with much interest . However , It would be well for the Director of the Veterans ' Bureau to thoroughly Investigate the conditions of the American merchant marine as it is today and the Prospects of the future for the American merchant marine before expending any money in the establishment of these schools . It will be remembered that during ? the war numerous schools were established by the Shipping Board for training young men for officers and various other capacities on American ships . Today a large percentage of the men who were so trained , and also the Americans who followed the sea as n profession previous to the war , are without employment . Wages for all classes of labor on stemnshipe have been reduced in greater proportion than in any other line of endeavor with which the writer Is familiar , and men have been waiting for months for opportunities to work for even the meagre wages which are offered at the present time . With the above facts in view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for the education of soldiers for positions on American merchant ships would merely be educating them for the purpose of transferring them from one class of unemployed labor to another . L. A. VAN MATRIO . New York , Jan. 18 , 1922 . Japan 's " Spheres of influence . " To the Editor of The New York Times : Japan acknowledges , through Baron Tr .. Shideliarit , that her Chinese " spheres of he . fluence " are vital necessities to Japan ' . The inference to be taken from the Baron 's remarks is that this problem , which Is purely Japan 's . It-lust be solved at the expense of her neighbor or neighbors . Has it ever occurred to the worthy Baron that these neighbors may have some rights in the matter and ( het Japan 's necessities , while we may be sympathetic , are really hers to solve In a manner which will not interfere with the rights or possessions of others ) ; It is a grave question whether an increase in population in itself is a benefit to Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be solved by controlling , as far as possible , her birth rate . The obvious fact which may be cited against this  --  that it is difficult of administration  --  Is true enough , but when the alternative is infringement upon the territories of other powers the question , difficult as it is , must be thrown beck upon Japan herself . It Japan can not control the increase of her population , and must find an outlet for It , it is open to her to allow her surplus population to Settle in such other countries as are open to this race ; whereupon these emigrants will take upon thetneelves the same status as expatriated Englishmen or Americans take under like circumstances . When an Englishman leaves his own country for America . Canada or Australia , he loses his British citizenship and becomes a Canadian , an Australian or an American . EVA L. MOLINEAUX .
