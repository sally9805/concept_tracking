The Comedians Are Coming <P> The musical comedy and revue season in Manhattan is fast becoming a laughing matter . No matter where you go , you run into a lot of crazy comedians . Long ago , it used to be the girls that sold the singing shows ; later , it became the music , even the singing itself now and then ; for the past few years , it has been the dancing . Currently , Broadway is flawed with wise cracks , opening everywhere to emit their little jests of joy . With the few inevitable exceptions , every great comedian we have will be winter-quartered in Manhattan . <P> At the risk of receiving infernal machines by mail , this department nominates Al Jolson as the big pet of joy , in fact as the geyser of gaiety . After an endless wandering in Bombo , he is preparing to go into action in Big Boy at approximately 9 p. m. every evening of the winter except Sunday . <P> Ed Wynn and Eddie Cantor emit almost as much cubic laughter per evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cantor will function most of the year in Kid Boots . <P> Lest your correspondent fail to mention the Marx Brothers in the same breath and thereby commit critical suicide , be it noted that they continue in I 'll Say She Is . Joe Cook and James Barton , further favorites of the erudite commentators , are with us in the Vanities and The Passing Show . W. C. Fields , last year 's most ribald recruit for the comedian championship , returns later in a show of his own writing , The Old Army Game . Most everyone knows that Will Rogers is in the Follies . <P> Raymond Hitchcock , after a period of metropolitan inactivity , is in eruption with the Ritz Revue . Associated with him is the elongated Charlotte Greenwood , than whom there is no more foolish female unless it be Fanny Brice , who is among the natural phenomena of the forthcoming Music Box Revue . In the same Box are Robert Benchley and the ridiculous Clark and McCullough . In Dutch is the Gallagher and Shean trademark . Leon Errol will fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Fred Stone , commanding exponent of clean fun , is just leaving . Jack Hazzard entangled himself with a failure called Bye , Bye , Barbara , but will probably be back . Other vacant niches are labeled : Sam Bernard , Lew Fields , Frank Tinney . Yet their absence can not discourage the general jet of joy . It seems that louder and funnier theatricals are inevitable . In fact , loudest and funniest .
