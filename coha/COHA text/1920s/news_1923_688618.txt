txt Continuing this attacks upon Mayor Hylan and his administration policies . Controller Charles L. Craig sent another memorandum to members of the State Legislature yesterday protesting against the bills introduced at Albany in relation to the issuance of city bonds . One bill authorizes the issuance of long term bonds for permanent public improvements , which the Mayor has termed his " Pay-as-you-go " bill , to take the place of a similar measure passed in the Mitchel administration . The Controller said this bill would add $15,000,000 to the city 's debt . Under the terms of another bill introduced at the request of the Mayor , the Controller declared that the erection of public buildings and the acquisition of sites would proceed unchecked by the debt limit . He said the latter bill did not apply to many of the buildings new under construction . In his opinion there is no necessity for either of the bills , and if they are enacted the city 's power to finance rapid transit will be seriously undermined . " The debt of the city will be piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liabilities that it should meet , " he added . I The Controller declared that he was not consulted in the introduction of the ' bills by the Mayor and as the , chief financial officer of the city charged with the responsibility of looking after the city 's credit so that it could handle the transit situation he was compelled to oppose the measures . The memorandum - is as follows : Text of the Memorandum . Memorandum in re Assembly Bill Int . 375 , Pr . No. 375 , by Assemblyman Dunne , and Assembly Bill Int . No. 435 , Pr . No. 439. by Assemblyman Alterman , to amend the Greater New York Charter in relation to the issue of bonds . These bills regulate the use of the credit of the City of New York . They authorize increasing the city 's debt for expenditures that should tie made in cash out of the current annual taxes . Assemblyman Dunne 's bill authorizes the issuance of long term bonds for " any public improvement of a substantial permanent character . " The only improvement expressly mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other public places . " Under this bill , $15,000,000 per year could be added to the city 's debt . Under Assemblyman Alterman 's bill there is no limit to the increase in the city 's debt , which may be made for " public buildings ? ? ? and the acquisition of sites therefor ? ? ? and the furnishing and equipment of such buildings or houses when first erected or acquired . " These bills do not ' relate to indetedness to be incurred for water Apply , docks , rapid transit , schools , ferries , the Staten Island Tunnel , west side improvement nor for any revenue producing improvement , for the city has express authority under existing laws eor all such purposes . Nor do the bills relate to any improvement the cost of which is to be met by assessing property benefited or an ' entire borough or the city at large ? such as the Coney Island Boardwalk , parks , playgrounds , &c.; Nor do the . bills relate to the proposed new Municipal Building in Brooklyn , the new Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Natural History , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Central Library in Brooklyn or the museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences or any public k.:nilding now in course of construction . All of these are covered by existing laws . Sees No Justification . I think it can skfely be asserted that there is neither Justification nor necessity for either of these bills . If they become law two results are inev- itable : First , the city 's power to finance rapid transit will be seriously undermined , if not entirely destroyed ; second , the debt-of the City of New York will he piled up merely to relieve . the State of New York from liabilities that it should meet . Proposals for the constl'uction and operation of new subways have been presented for public consideration , the cost of which requires the use of the city 's credit to the extent of several hundred million dollars . Without going into figures , it may unhesitatingly be said that for the City of New York to finance urgently needed transit facilities . will require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , but will also require the utmost skill in the use of that credit and the postponement of other ' very desirable public improve1 ments until a subsequent time . The Dunne bill would authorize the present city administration in the three years of its unexpired term to tie up I $45.000,000 of the city 's debt margin , and if the Alterman bill , which has no limit , were subjected to a self-imposed limit by a majority of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment equal to that in the Dunne bill , $45,000.000 more would be added o the City 's debt in the same period . If , in this manner , $90,000.000 is to be taken from the city 's credit , then municipal ownership and operation of transit facilities may as well be forgotten forthwith . If only $45,000,000 be diverted under the Dunne bill , it would be a serious deduction from transit resources . Entirely aside from their effect on the transit situation , there is no necessity for the passage of these bills . Fears Growth of Debt . The replacing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no essential particular from the payment of salaries and wages and the purchase of materials and . supplies . The construction of comfort stations , branch libraries , police station houses , firehouses , garages and practically all other public buildings not provided for under existing laws is a species of recurring expenditures the requirements for which each year are about the came ; and If their costs were financed by bond issues instead of by current taxes the city 's debt would mount higher and higher . and less and less of its credit would be left for the enduring public works like subways , docks , schools . &c.; It may be alleged , however , that the city can not provide for these things in the budget or annual taxes , because the amount annually to be raised by taxes has reached the limit prescribed in Article VIII. , Section 10 , of the Constitution . That is true ; but it is a condition that can easily be corrected , and it should be corrected without delay . The City of New York has been driven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the support of education . The unfairness lies with past Legislatures and the improvidence in the policy insisted upon by Mayor Hylan . Discusses Teachers ' Salaries . In 1919 and 1920 the Legislature in creased the salaries of the teaching , supervising and administrative staff in the public schools of New York City at the rate of $31,000,000 per year : and by subsequent legislation affecting City College and Hunter College , and by the enlargement of the school system , the increments and pension requirements , the annual increase is now at the rate of approximately . $36.000,000 a year . These increases were made on the theory that education is a State function ; but when it came to provide the wherewithal to meet the liabilities thus created education did not continue to be a State function . Increased salaries for school teachers were not regarded as consistent with economy in the State appropriation bill . The members of the Legislature who vtoed for the salaries did not vote the money to pay them . Prior to the passage of such legislation the State of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teachers ' salaries in New York City . When the Legislature increased the teachers ' salaries the State of New York increased its appropriation to aid in paying them in New York City to about $18,900,000 for the current year . In other words , the Legislature increased liabilities for salaries at the rate of $36,000,000 per year - but provided only a little more than $13,000,000 per year to meet the liability . This is a little more than thirty-five cents on the dollar . That might sound ? like a good settlement in a bankruptcy court or a traction receivership , but it is not worthy of the great State of - New York . Therein rests the unfairness of Wm legislation . If the Leirialature provided the whole of the increase to be paid in school salaries in New York City , it would still be providing less than one-half of the cost of such salaries . Insists State Should Pay . Personally I have never ceased-to insist that the State should assume its just proportion of these increases and finance it by its own power of taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York would not , now-be forced to the limit of its taxing power to meet the State 's liability . It would have ample time to finance the repaving of streets and other expenditures covered by the Dunne and Alterman bills . In their final analysis these bills , in effect , require the City of New York to issue long term bonds to ? pay teachers ' salaries . Mayor Hylan , however , has preferred to have the city carry . the State 's liabilities rather than insist upon the State doing so . It was ? considered inexpedient to run the risk of a charge that the City Administration was not appropriating enough money to support the schools . Rather than squarely put this responsibility up to the State to carry out its theory that education is a State function , the Dunne and ' Alterman bills are put forth to run the city into debt and impair the credit it needs for transit facilities . Mayor Hylan has publicly stated that he had such legislation prepared and introduced and requested the members of the Board of Estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid in the passage of such measures . This action was - taken by Mayor Hylan after I had several times explained to him the undesirability of such legislation and that it should not be introduced . Its introduction was without notice to me . As the chief financial officer of the city of New York , charged with the responsibility of issuing and selling any bond 's authorized thereunder , and desiring to conserve the city 's credit so that it may handle the transit situation without being delivered in bondage to the Interborough or the- B. R. T. , I am compelled to oppose these measures . In conclusion , I may add that the Dunne bill , while purporting to relate to the repaving of gtv.tets , would in three years ' operation finance the cost of a new bridge over the East River . Such a bridge can not be financed under existing laws except as a toll bridge . Controller Craig remained at Lakewood , N. J .. yesterday , but it was announced that he would return to the city on Tuesday , -  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
