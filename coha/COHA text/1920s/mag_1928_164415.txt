Why should onetime President of France Alexandre Millerand , 69 , stand up in a pelting rain storm and deliver an oration about cheese ? <P> The reason seemed simple , rational last week to citizens of Vimoutier , 35 miles south of fashionable Deauville . In their public square stood a splendid new statue , ready for unveiling , a statue of a peasant woman holding a pot of cheese . <P> With the portentous tread of a cheese gourmet and epicure , M. Millerand advanced to the base of the statue . There he spoke movingly of the woman now commemorated in bronze , Mme. Marie Harel . It was to her glory and to the glory of France , said Alexandre Millerand , that in 1771 good Mme. Marie Harel invented and produced that soft white pearl among cheeses , Camembert . Today , added practical Lawyer Millerand , the sale of French Camembert exceeds 75,000,000 boxes per annum.
