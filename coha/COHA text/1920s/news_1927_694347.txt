txt President Coolidge considers reduction of taxation an i the public debt as the greatest possible benefit to the country despite arguments by returning members of Congress for his support of pending legislation for numerous projects . It was made clear at the White House that Mr. Coolidge intends to insist upon steady reduction in the public debt in the face of whatever new legislation Congress may consider . In the President 's opinion the annual interest charges on the public debt would more than pay the cost of the Mississippi flood disaster at an outside estimate . That is an example , to his mind , of the importance of lowering interest charges by reducing the public debt . President Coolidge in a speech before the Red Cross on Monday had no intention of indicating that the administration had ready any set program of flood relief , coupled with inland waterway developments . However , as flood relief plans progress waterway developments along the Mississippi will follow naturally .                   @ @
