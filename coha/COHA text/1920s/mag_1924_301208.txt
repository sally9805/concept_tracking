The development of a theory : <P> Cancer is caused by absence in the human body of a serum which dissolves centres of infection . Therefore , extract this serum from animals and inject into humans . <P> But it is found necessary to repeat this treatment every few weeks , with the result that the patient 's natural resistance is weakened . <P> It is then discovered that the serum which naturally prevents cancer is produced in a small gland in the neck , and that this gland becomes decreasingly active until , at 50 , it often ceases to function . Therefore , stimulate this gland . But the gland can not be sufficiently stimulated . <P> Finally a serum , artificially made , is discovered . Injection of this serum will give immunity from cancer . Use of the serum in connection with an operation will prevent a reappearance of the disease . <P> This epitomizes the work of Professor Gaetano Fichera , upon which he has lavished a great part of his life and most of his private fortune , at Pavia , Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the meeting of the Medical Section of the League of Nations , at Rome , next month . <P> Many medical men , as tribute to Fichera , have undertaken to collect funds for a cancer institute in Milan , where his discoveries can be developed .
