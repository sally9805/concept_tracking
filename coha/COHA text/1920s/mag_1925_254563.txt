" With the Atlantic comfortably smooth , we are headed for the Sargasso Sea* and expect to resume our trawling and dredging there , which we had to abandon in March owing to high seas . " Such was last week 's , news of Explorer William Beebe , whose last wireless , reports ( TIME , May 11 ) came from the neighborhood of Galapagos in the Pacific . <P> Meantime , a book appeared in the U.

The style , vivid and highly charged with verbs and adjectives as exotic as the boat-billed toucans on the book 's jacket , ranges from the masterly English of Galapagos and Jungle Nights , to sloppy jargon . In the midst of Author Beebe 's spells , one is continually jerked up by the wish that , on his present trawling trip to Galapagos , he may lose the word " adumbrate " forever overboard . <P> <P> * An expanse of ocean bounded roughly by 25 and 30 N. and 38 and 60 W. , which currents make a back-water accumulating flotsam .
