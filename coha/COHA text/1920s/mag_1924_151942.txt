The U. S. globe-circling aeronauts sat in lonely Reykjavik ( Iceland ) and looked out westward over a cold grey sea . Naval scouts wirelessed them that the eastern harbors of Greenland were jammed with ice-floes , that their next hop would have to be 825 miles , to Ivigtut on a southerly Greenland cape . That meant they would need to carry extra fuel . Hoisting spare gasoline tankards aboard , the pilots started their engines , sought to take off . But the tankards were too heavy . The planes could not rise . Exasperated , the pilots tossed away every nonessential ounce , repaired minor breakage occasioned by their false starts , shot off hazardously . After 10 hours and 19 minutes in the air-fortunately not tempestuous-they soared down through a dense fog that blanketed their haven , " taxied " safely to anchorage . Lieut . Locatelli , exploring northern airways for the Italian Government ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) , who had preceded the U. S. couple out of Reykjavik by a few minutes , did not turn up in Ivigtut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neared the Greenland fog banks and felt sure he had not overshot his mark . Searchers from Ivigtut cruised the perilous icebound coast to eastward , Esquimaux trotted along the shore , looking , looking . Late Sunday night , 125 miles from shore , floating helplessly with a dead motor , Locatelli and his companions were sighted amid the waves by the U. S. cruiser Richmond , were taken aboard worn with fatigue but sound . To save the patrol ships further trouble , Locatelli scuttled his plane .
