Chuckling because he , a dentist , and so an engineer and founder of sorts , was asked to make a small gold rivet for the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corp. , Dr. Henry Roehner , Goodyear Tire &; Rubber 's rosy-round company dentist , last week took some gold used for making inlays and bridges , melted it , poured it into a plaster-of-paris mold . The resulting gold rod was about the size of a girl 's eye tooth . It weighed two pennyweights , worth less than $2 in coin value and not more than $5 as dental gold . As a golden rivet , however , its intrinsic value was incalculable , for it was made to be fastened into the highest j part of the biggest ( " master " ) rib-ring of the biggest dirigible yet planned-the ZRS-4 which the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corp . was to start building this week for the U. S. Navy , with ceremonies which , however , the funeral of Senator Theodore E. Burton at Cleveland delayed a week . <P> The Goodyear-Zeppelin Corp . was formed five years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubber had visited Friedrichshafen , home of the Zeppelin Luftschiffbau , where dirigible-building is an adult profession . Mr. Litchfield , who long before the War had induced Goodyear Tire &; Rubber to build balloons , saw opportunity in dirigibles . He dickered with Dr. Hugo Eckener , as usual in need of construction money , for the American rights to build rigid airships and for the loan of some Zeppelin technical men . The Goodyear men incorporated Goodyear-Zeppelin Corp . The Zeppelin Works got a minority block of its stock . Dr. Eckener became a director/ Most important for the U. S. company was the transfer of Dr. Karl Arnstein , Prague-born chief engineer of the German company , to Akron . <P> At once Dr. Arnstein began designing two military rigid airships of 6,500,000 cubic feet capacity. * His design won first prizes in two competitions held by the Navy 's bureau of Aeronautics . Last year Goodyear-Zeppelin got its Navy contracts and started work . <P> Last week preparatory labors were almost done . Preparations consisted of building at Akron the largest airship factory and dock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 364,000 square feet ( more than 8 acres ) , the largest single uninterrupted floor area yet built . Over this is the dock structure , a cavernous semi-paraboloid building 211 ft. high , 1,175 ft. long . From the high perspective of a flying machine it looks like a peanut or silkworm cocoon . Although the dock was not entirely covered last week , 40,000 people could congregate under the finished portion to watch the ceremony of fastening the first sections of the first airship with Dentist Roehner 's gold rivet . <P> It is to be shortly after noon . Light through the girders and from many searchlights fall on a comparatively diminutive fabric of duralumin lying at one end of the dock . The duralumin section is 50 ft. long , 10 ft. high , and just one arc of the 133-ft. diameter ring which is to be the " keel " of the airship . A rope on standards marks off the round of the ring-to-be . Within the circumference are 400 dignitaries , official guests , each with a 3-in. disk of duraluminum , memento of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
