Squiggle , loop , scratch went the fountain pen of a swart little Dictator-King Ahmed Zogu , last week , signing out the old Islamic law of Albania , signing in a new civil code based on the Swiss. * <P> No longer will an Albanian husband divorce his wife at pleasure in the Moslem manner simply by exclaiming three times , " I divorce thee-thou art no longer my wife ! " * The minutest private acts of Albanians need no longer conform to the precepts of the True Prophet . Finally a salutary Swiss provision against carrying concealed weapons will completely alter , if it can be enforced , one of the most cherished customs of Albanians , who have always gone about with loaded pistols and sharp snicker-snees in their dirty blouses . <P> Another reform of King Ahmed Zogu has been to encourage Greek Orthodox prelates among his subjects to proclaim at Tirana a new Holy Synod of Albania , with Archbishop Bessario Javani as its President . In Constantinople the Most Holy Patriarch Basil of the Greek Orthodox Church was incensed , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Synod . Soon he unfrocked with awful and pious curses both Albanian Archbishop Javani and his ecclesiastical accomplice the Archimandrite Tjamzi of Berat . <P> *Similarly based on the Swiss code is the new civil law imposed on Turkey by Dictator-President Mustafha Kemal Pasha ( TIME , Feb. 21 , 1927 ) . *Egyptian Prince Sabit Bey divorced himself in this convenient fashion from Mrs. Jean Nash , famed " Best Dressed Woman in the World , " after they had been wed for a whole month .
