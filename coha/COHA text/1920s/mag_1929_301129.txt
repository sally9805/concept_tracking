At six in the morning , most Roman citizens are still abed . Few were the early risers who saw , one morning last week , four automobiles speeding by a devious route-past the Temple of Vesta , the Palatine , the Circus Maximus and the Coliseum-to the Basilica of St. John Lateran , which is the cathedral of the Diocese , its high altar reserved to the Bishop of Rome , who is the Pope . A small party of ecclesiastics got out of the motors , entered the church . <P> Inside the Basilica , Pope Pius XI , served by only one acolyte , celebrated mass at the spot where , 50 years before , he had been , ordained to the priesthood . After mass he went next door , visited the Lateran Palace . Then back to the Vatican he went , as quietly as he had come . Next day the Pope , robed in the full majesty of his Pontificate , in cream-colored silk cloak , gold- &-silver-embroidered,; crowned with the Triregnum ( triple crown ) , closed his golden jubilee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where 70.000 Catholics cheered him . Then he beatified the relics of Father John Ogilvie , Scottish priest hanged by the Calvinists 300 years ago . <P> After conferring the galerum rubrum ( red hat ) and cappa magna ( Cardinal 's cloak ) on the six new Cardinals named last month ( TIME , Dec. 2 ) , His Holiness Pope Pius XI last week published an encyclical letter to the Catholic episcopacy . Excerpt : " The greatest malady of the modern age , the principal source of the evils we all deplore , is the lack of reflection . . . . There is only one remedy which I can propose . This is to invite tired souls to have recourse to spiritual exercises . . . . We must not neglect this supernatural breath which is life to many souls . "
