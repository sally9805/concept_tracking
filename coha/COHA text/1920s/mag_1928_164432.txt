Flowers were in the arms of Lucrezia Bori and everywhere on the front of the stage . Applause was thundering . Miss Bori was bowing . The audience was standing up . Miss Bori tossed one of her bouquets to a woman standing in the second row of the orchestra . The woman caught it gracefully . She , too , bowed . The applause was getting louder and louder . Much of it was meant for the woman in the second row . Her name , as everyone knew , was Geraldine Farrar , 46 , onetime darling of the diamond horseshoe . <P> Thus , the noisiest , longest and perhaps the most sincere demonstration of the Metropolitan Opera Company 's season in Manhattan . It happened last week after the second act of La Rondine , in which Miss Bori sang with triumphant charm . It was also the last week of the season ; but before Miss Bori packed her trunks , she did something that would have pleased the late Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . It was not easy , for Mozart operas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance a season . But Miss Bori was allowed to sing Despina in his Cos Fan Tutte ( ' T is Thus They All Do ) . There was no denying that the story of two young men setting out to hoodwink their fiancees into infidelity was faint fodder for great music . Mozart , however , could put anything-a piece of string , a blot of ink-to music . So well did Miss Bori interpret Cos Fan Tutte that critics raised a cry for more Mozart. * <P> Giulio Gatti-Casazza has completed 20 years as impresario of the Metropolitan .
