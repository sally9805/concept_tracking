The dissatisfied Chicago theatre musicians who are clamoring for bigger money ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) , threatening to walk out on Labor Day , are rapidly infecting their brethren all over the country with the spirit of revolt . The insurrection has spread from Chicago to St. Louis , Cincinnati , Washington , Philadelphia , New York , Syracuse , Boston , within a week 's time . Requests for a 10% increase in material appreciation have swelled to demands for as much as 50% additional salary . The original band of 700 strikers has grown to a body of 4,000 or 5,000 unwilling performers . Theatre owners stand by their original compromise-offer of a 5% increase in salaries , which would bring them up to from $60 to $90 per week . If the deadlock continues , Sept. 1st will find our eastern playhouses deprived of the dulcet rustle of violins as the lovers dally in the garden , and of the eerie wail of the clarinet as the butler hides the revolver in the sideboard .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
