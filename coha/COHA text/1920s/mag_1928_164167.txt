Nearly two months ago ( TIME , May 28 ) , there appeared in the Oxford Isis an editorial denouncing " Buchmanism . " Like all criticism of this cult , the editorial received wide publicity . Observers in the U. S. supposed that English collegians , like the majority of their U. S. fellows , had been stung to fury by an unauthorized insertion of an unpopular propaganda . Such a supposition was not encouraged by a letter which was soon published in the London Times : <P> DR . BUCHMAN IN OXFORD <P> TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES <P> Sir , -A report has been widely circulated regarding the work of the groups in Oxford associated with the name of the Rev. F. N. D. Buchman , D.D . From what we have observed of the results of this work , it is our belief that this criticism has arisen from misunderstanding and unfounded rumour , and misrepresents the spirit of the work . The letter was printed above another communication which dealt with " The Laws of Cricket . " It was signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important colleges at Oxford : Alexander Dunlop Lindsay , Master of Balliol , Sir Michael Ernest Sadler , Master of University , and W. C. Costin , Dean of St. John's.
