Walt Whitman y OU ask my opinion about the place of Walt ' Whit ? man in American Poetry and hero-worship ? He is " in my humble opinion " as big a poet as his most em ? phatic admirer makes him out to be . John Burroughs and also the latest Thibetan to discover Leaves of Grass arc right about the book . But Whitman is no hero , and much turns on this . Stephen Graham has . generally reported me most kindly and most generously . But in one place he has me wrong . He says I prefer Longfellow to Whitman . No , I prefer Whitman to Longfellow . I agree with the whole of Greenwich Village about Leaves of Grass . I agree with them about Longfellow 's poems . But I prefer Andrew Jackson to either man , as a " hero . " Here I part , with the Village . Those who are impatient with the citizens of the U. S. A. for not surrendering abjectly to Walt Whitman , and producing an army of singers and citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they should blame oneof the habits of art history . Walt Whitman , like Milton and Michael Angelo , has the grand style , with all the fatalities of the grand style for imitators or slavish ad ? mirerS . Michael Angelo 's art destroyed the Renaissance . All who imitated him were destroyed , and his manner was so infectious that he bred generations of pompous " little giants . " It was a sound instinct in all those who refused to be in any way infected . Those who imitated Donatello might still grow into themselves , but the sculptor or painter touched to imitation by Michael Angelo was forever dis ? tended . Michael Angelo was the only volcano with the lava to fill a crater so gigantic . All the others burned with fires of straw . Not till William Blake was there a draughtsman or painter who could take over the manner of Michael Angelo ? without being destroyed by it . He was , first , a man of letters , and is still for the most part a literary tradition on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill that old crater , however . I should say that we are fortunate in Sandburg , who owes a direct debt to Whitman , without being destroyed by him . But we may find in this a reason parallel to the triumph of Blake . Sandburg is something more than a Whitmanite . And there is only one Sandburg , not an army of a million singing Sandburgs . The parallel of Whitman with Milton ? as a destroying influence ? is even more precise . No imitator of Milton , so far as I know , ever gained a fully authoritative place , even for a time , except Mr. Young , the distinguished author of the Night Thoughts , and Mr. Young is now forgotten . Certainly we do not have a million democratic Miltonites . I hold that young imitators of Donatello , or Wordsworth , are not in artistic danger . Such masters are " democratic " enough , and such direct and simple masters keep the talent an ? elastic child , not overstrained , till it finds its own direc ? tion . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve or write . It is a sound instinct to leave the author of a grand style as solitary as the politicians leave George Washington . It is a sound instinct to admire him ? but to begin again . Andrew Jackson showed that sound instinct in fighting Washington . There was some ? thing in it deeper than politics . Andrew Jackson foresaw the two-cent stamp , and the Gilbert Stuart portraits . The only direct imitation of George Washington 's grand style I know is Robert E. Lee . I prefer J. E. B. Stuart , as a hero of the Confederacy . He who would have a grand style ? must begin again . And it is personally and artistically , even then , ? a perilous business . It has been achieved in the Woolworth Tower . But in no imitation thereof , direct or indirect . Yet Amer ? ica is full of successful variations of the bungalow theme . And Scribner 's Magazine and Harper 's Magazine are just alike , and " little masterpieces . " Another reason the citizens of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do before Lincoln in statesmanship ? is that there are no interesting details to Whitman . He might even be compared to a bound volume of Daniel Webster 's Orations . But there is no such perpetual distension either in the letters and speeches of Lincoln or the incidents of his life . He gets down off his high horse the minute the great occasion is over . With Whitman America is not a land , but a sea , with one wave about the size of every other wave . It is all horizon line , and no gossip , except suppressed gossip . Lincoln 's best biographer is his battered gossiping old law partner Herndon who told every tale out of school , and yet left his hero standing . The bold ' Whitman concealed most of the essential facts of his life , and biographically is best at a distance like certain bare mountains or half-extinct volcanoes . Yet Whitman claims ? and his fanatical follow ? ers claim for him ? a perstnal devotion . A literary and personal devotion has been accorded . to Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers claim for him a devotion beyond the wildest that was ever accorded to Lincoln at the height of the Civil War . Now this has nothing to do with art or literature , yet it is thoroughly mixed up with ' Whitman 's alleged claim , till it almost ruins the claim . He seems to make it himself . But his followers have misread him . They thrust him upon us like Buddha , Prince Siddartha . What men in history have rightly won a personal devotion ? The first , in my opinion , is Prince Siddartha . The second that occurs to me is St. Francis . These are my heroes tonight . As for St. Francis he won the allegiance of saints and sinners . But The Little Flowers of St. Francis records a life that // was a masterpiece . Whitman 's book was a masterpiece , but his life was only half that good . Or for an instance of deserved worship take a pagan , a great mixer ? Raphael . His life was a cup of wine . He died " worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trick to it . That hand was the same fabric of flesh as the pictures . The eye was the same eye . This only happens once in hundreds of years ? , ? that the man is the same ex ? cellent fabric as his art . Whitman claimed to be such a man . He was not . He , personally , was in the same class with Santa Claus and Longfellow when he behaved , and when he did not behave he was something like the King in Huckleberry Finn , an admirable man in some respects , but no leader , neither Caesar nor Brutus . Leadership , the ' kind that shines through all the mists of the centuries , - sacramental leadership ? where the very body and blood of the leader is identified with his work ? is seldom the gift of the artists , or we would have gods , and not men , very soon . Buddha did not write . Socrates did not write . It left them the strength to make an art of life . So , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pupil of Plato ever made the claim for his personality he continually made for the per ? sonality of Socrates . Yet your true Whitmanite would combine the general consequence and weight of these two men and call it Whitman . And the Puzzled citizens of the United States grow suspicious . VVhitman can never be any nearer to them than Milton , and Milton 's private conduct is not thrust upon them even in vague and dull metaphor as the supreme model of heroic democracy ? though he went blind in what to him was a holy cause , the radicalism and democracy of his time . Whitman , per ? sonally , has less real ginger in his life than the Damaged Souls of Gamaliel Bradford . For courage and style John Randolph of Roanoke was a whole lot more of a man ; for frankness and variety of incident Barnum outshines Whitman , and for thumping democracy Benjamin F. Butler is more of an American , with all his sins . I can admire a devil ? but he must have some salt . I can ad- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some personal lightning . Not all the personal tales about Whitman equal the single simple narrative of John Randolph , fresh from hunting , marching into Congress and down the aisle with his hound-dogs in front of him and a dog-whip in his hand . I will grant for Whitman 's Leaves of Grass everything ever said in its praise by the wildest French critic . But the thesis of Whitman 's followers is that we must follow him personally . Which would mean we must be lost in clouds and deliberate obscurities and personal secrecies . We have not even an apocryphal cherry-tree story to cling to . The American people if they love a man as a hero of romance must know as much about him as Spain knew of Don Quixote or America knows of Henry Ford . We want a few details . There is no true confession in Whitman . Mark Twain tells on himself . In Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn he tells on himself as a youth . In The Mysterious Stranger he tells on himself , as an old man . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back , ; we would have had still more confession . Therefore he has a growing " personal " leadership , by no means what is claimed for Whitman , but nearer to the Great Democrat whose sins are a secular sacrament than Whitman 's fanatical followers can ever ? make of him for us . Finally : ? Whitman ? both as a man and a poet ? fails in his definition of United States democracy , in an essential matter . He has no chivalry . His heroines are neither mediaeval nor modern . They are the fat and foolish ladies that sit on pillowy pulchritudinous clouds and decorate the court paintings of Peter Paul Rubens . Rubens is also magnificent , epic , ? but no one ever claimed for him , per ? sonally , the one and only spot-light and divine honors . Like Whitman he went forward serving a muse who was indeed a thumping giantess , fair , fat , fish-eyed , frail and forty . But she neither demands nor inspires chivalry . And chivalry is one of the indestructible elements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American life . It grows and takes new beautiful forms even here . I remember the birth of the Gibson Girl . We all , high and low , gave her a breathless devotion . Mary Pickford is a person of appalling simplicity , but chivalry is the essence of the United States dream of her . And do you remember the reign of Grover Cleveland 's bride ? Edgar Lee Masters 's most heart-searching poems are Anne Rut ? ledge and Lucinda Matlock . Chivalry is of the essence of these poems . The daughter of the poorest poor white may win a place in one of our inter-state beauty contests , and the prize will not be for cheap silliness . Even in this there is more austerity , more Athenian grace and more chivalry than in all of Whitman . He assumes that that child can ? not possibly be exquisite . He assumes in her cheapness , slackness . Even our most elementary democracy understands that beauty is a proud , filigree , butterfly humming bird thing . 0 . Henry 's little shop girls , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments when they were high ? bred . They were all craving honor and worship , the most delicate flowers and honors our tournament could give , and the most filigree crowns in sight . There is no lace in Whitman 's democracy , though there is lace on the Negro baby 's cap , and there are delicate feathers in the war-bonnet of the Indian . Robin Hood is to be seen in this little town next week . Pretty soon comes The Covered Wagon . They are both famous films , both essentially democratic ? and breathe from end to end of chivalry , chivalry . All men must be equal , but all little girls must be queens ! We demand in the U. S. A. millions of queens , forever and ever . The root of the matter was in Mark Twain . He wor ? shipped Joan of Arc as some old southern Colonel might worship his favorite daughter or niece . He was after all only an old southern Colonel disguised as a humorist . And in his worship of Joan of Arc all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maiden was ever more abject or magnificent . No one is going to cure us of the worship of women who are good and beautiful , by any kind of silly theory , even though it be from the latest medical book . No doctor will ever cure little boys of buying lace valentines for pretty little girls . I have recited in hundreds of high school assemblies in this country , from Maine to California , assemblies two thousand strong , and giving for my delectation all their yells . But the chivalry was there . The girls were all potential movie queens ? but still queens , and not fat fish ? wives , and it was perfectly obvious the boys feared and loved them . Their athletic contests all have the flavor of Valentine 's Day and the old tournaments combined . And this in the high school ? where young America is at its rawest stage , and really the most " democratic " period of its existence in the Whitman sense . They are children of Robin Hood , and of The Covered Wagon heroics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Michael Angelo are . After all both those men had a passionately democratic theory of life , nearer Whitman 's than we will admit . But their " grand style " is a peril to artists and personal imitators . Those who come after them in democracy , in citizenship or in art , must begin again with other models , even if their final goal is the grand style . It is good medicine , but bad food . ' Whitman urges it upon us as food . Sandburg has taken it as medicine only . Whitman will always survive outside the main line of tradition as a gigantic lonely individual . He can not take the central place , for he has no heroines , not even a Juliet nor a " little shop girl . " Anne Rutledge is nearer to being our ultimate sweetheart and the Virgin Mary nearer to being our ultimate Queen than all the glad Jezebels of Whitman . There is not one valentine in him . And Amer ? ica is a land of valentines , white lace valentines.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
