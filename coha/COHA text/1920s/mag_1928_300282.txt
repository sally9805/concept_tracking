( See front cover ) <P> Dec. 17 , 1903 , Orville Wright , at Kitty Hawk , * N. C. , made the first airplane flight in history . His brother Wilbur who had helped him invent the motor and design the plane , watched him , nervous , confident and inquisitive , from the ground . An undertaker also stood by . Wilbur Wright died in 1912 ; but Orville Wright has lived to see : <P> 1 ) This week , the $100,000,000 U. S. aviation industry hold a vast commercial exposition at Chicago ; <P> 2 ) Next fortnight , himself as guest of honor at the International Conference on Civil Aeronautics , at Washington ; <P> 3 ) Dec. 17 , his flight 's silver anniversary ceremonies at Kitty Hawk-the National Aeronautic Association dedicating a 10-ton granite boulder at the point whence he took off , the Government laying the cornerstone of a monument there . <P> First Flight . A biting cold wind was blowing 24 miles an hour along the beach at Kitty Hawk the morning of Dec. 17 , 1903 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on a knoll . Dismally nearby was a horse and wagon . A man sat on the wagon seat , leaning patiently forward , his hands hanging loosely between his knees , the reins looped over a crooked finger . He was a native undertaker . <P> The plane resembled a great , wide box kite with " struts supporting vertical and horizontal rudders far out in the rear . The engine was at one side of the flyer 's seat , so that if the plane tumbled it would not fall on him . Two skids projected in front to prevent the plane somersaulting on landing . <P> The Wrights built the plane according to specifications which they developed themselves . When they had been boys at Dayton , Ohio , they had played with kites and gliders and grew expert in their flight . When they were young men and in the bicycle business they continued to study aerodynamics . They built themselves a wind tunnel and learned new aerodynamical laws . Two things , they learned , happened to a moving plane-wind " pushed it up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the plane was slightly curved and tapered from front to back the suction force was about three times the pushing force . They learned , too , how to warp the plane wings , how to steer it , how to control it in all ways . They built their own motor . And then they were ready to make their first flight . <P> At Kitty Hawk that cold December week , Wilbur and Orville Wright tossed a coin to decide which would try the first flight . Wilbur won , got into the machine , rose a few feet . After three seconds the machine stalled . Next it was Orville 's turn . He succeeded ; he sustained the flight of a kite . <P> Wright Honors . The U. S. , then , was tepid to flying . So the Wrights went to Europe . There they won recognition and financial backing . That is why , when Orville Wright believed that the Smithsonian Institution at Washington was erroneously giving the late Samuel Pierpont Langley credit for the first man-carrying airplane , he sent his Kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , London , for preservation . <P> Of course , Orville and Wilbur Wright , who never attended college , soon received honorary academic degrees . Orville Wright has eight . <P> And , of course , they made money . In 1915 , three years after Wilbur Wright 's death , Orville sold his patents to the Wright Aeronautical Corp . It is a $7,000,000 concern .
