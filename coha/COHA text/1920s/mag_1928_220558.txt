If a white elephant , adorned with tar and talcum powder , strolled down Fifth Avenue , Manhattan , at 12 noon , trailing behind her a train of toy trolley cars , each painted , in large letters , with the name of that excellent hostelry , The Hotel Roosevelt , what would this be ? It would be a publicity stunt . What would a hardboiled , wise , cynical , alert newspaper reporter think it was ? He would think it was a front-page story . This , at least , was the opinion which intelligent persons were compelled to adopt after witnessing last week in Manhattan an example of journalistic susceptibility to unoriginal press-agenting . <P> There was an acrobatic dancer , one Mlle. Simone Roseray , who performed adequately enough , in a Manhattan night club . The press-agent for this night club , one Irving Strouse , cudgeled his wits to think of some smart dodge whereby he could place Mlle. Roseray and the club in which she performed , more conspicuously before the public eye than either had ever been before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mlle. Roseray would go into Central Park and give an imitation of a woman trying , not very hard , to commit suicide ; she would be rescued by sensation seekers who , with shouts and squealings , might decoy a few newshawks to the scene of action . Newshawks would then fly to the home of Mlle. Roseray ; there they would find a note addressed to the proprietor of her night club , a suicide note , of which this was to be the purport : " Because , you see , I love you . " In the meantime , the rescued lady would be taken to a hospital , examined by a physician and let loose to an admiring world . After a day or two , there could be an advertisement in the papers saying : " Mlle. Roseray , now completely recovered from her recent indisposition , is dancing nightly . ... " <P> All happened as arranged . At an early hour on Sunday morning , just late enough to miss the Sunday morning papers and in time to give the reporters a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday 's packets , Mlle. Roseray waded into a small and shallow Central Park pond , splashed . A man dashed , fully garbed , toward the floundering female , who struggled away from him through the broken ice . " Mister , Mister , let me alone , " she cried , but eventually permitted herself to be taken to the Lexington Avenue Hospital . Here , Mlle. Roseray was treated by a Dr. Martin J. Blank , who , despite his name , was no party to the plot ; the man was put to bed so as to recover from a severe chill . <P> But were the reporters , when they arrived , as stupid as Press-agent Strouse had fondly hoped ? They were , with one exception , more stupid . Forgetting that the most obvious moment for such a publicity stunt was precisely the moment at which it had occurred , they sleepily made up their minds that no one who did not really want to drown would have chosen such a time for submergence . They discovered a photograph of a man , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's handbag ; but no clue was offered when they perceived that the image was that of the proprietor of her night club . The Lexington Avenue Hospital refused to inform them as to whether Mlle. Roseray would recover , or how soon . These details the reporters were compelled to invent .
