Swift coursing news must be speeded onto paper by a lightning , decisive mind . Necessarily the titans of newspaperdom have been dictators-James Gordon Bennett , Joseph Pulitzer , Viscount Northcliffe . These men had no time , in business moments , for Democracy or its delays . They are dead , but their dynamic Shades must have approved , last week , when that trampler upon Democracy , Signor Benito Mussolini , * was impetuously championed in the London Daily Mail by its owner , Lord Rothermere , brother and successor to the late Lord Northcliffe . <P> No sooner had Il Duce entertained Harold Sidney Harmsworth , Viscount Rothermere , in audience , at Rome last week , than His Lordship rushed to cable the Daily Mail , over his personal signature , and with an abrupt , excited opening paragraph , as follows : <P> " ' As you can see for yourself , the Fascist regime is unshakable . ' <P> " These emphatic words , spoken to me by Signor Mussolini during my visit here , deserve the attention of the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five and a half years this month since Mussolini seized personal responsibility for his country 's fortunes by his dramatic ' march on Rome ' in October 1922 . <P> " To most northern minds that enterprise seemed at first no more than a desperate incident in Italy 's impending collapse into Bolshevism . <P> " The Italian nation virtually was at civil war . Railways , postal and telegraphic services . . . were hopelessly disorganized . Industry had been paralyzed for several years by revolutionary strikes . The government had lost all effective authority . Parliament was a feeble confusion of conflicting cliques . <P> " This was a supreme crisis not only for Italy but for Europe . . . . <P> " Our escape from so great a danger we owe to Mussolini alone . . . . <P> " There can be no doubt as to the verdict of future generations on his achievement . He is the greatest figure of our age . " <P> Although none could doubt the sincerity of bullnecked , forthright Lord Rothermere , persons of active memory recalled that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this " founding " was essentially a renaming of Nationalist groups which had been assembled by others in the days when Benito Mussolini was an ardent Socialist if not a Red . <P> Lord Rothermere , secure in the knowledge that Il Duce is now politically a Black , wrote on , last week , in somewhat mystic vein : <P> " To that broad table of his , in the corner of a vast room in the historic Palazzo Chigi , which with its lofty painted roof and row of fixed seats like choir stalls has something of an air of sacristy , are brought for Mussolini 's approval reports and projects from almost every branch of public life in the country . <P> " He sits there in a carved chair with nothing in front of him but a long list of his day 's appointments , giving decisions on the manifold and complex questions that come before him with extraordinary powers of memory and judgment . <P> " Very seldom does Mussolini need to call for the file of any state business which he previously had studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' is one of his sayings . . . .
