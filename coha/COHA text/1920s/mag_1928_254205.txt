The Who , pre-eminently Who Is William Gibbs , the McAdoo . . . He 's always up and McAdooing From Sun to Star and Star to Sun His work is never McAdone . <P> Early this month , the McAdoo got himself up in the red and black velvet of a caballero and up onto a prancing mare . Mare and McAdoo were chief prancers at an oldtime Santa Barbara fiesta . No man had better right to be . Ever since the earthquake ( TIME , July 6 , 1925 ) he , lawyer-engineer with many a mighty deed to his credit as such , has been in the front of reconstruction of that lovely town . He and his wife ( daughter of the late Woodrow Wilson ) are prominent &; popular in Santa Barbara 's so-called millionaire colony . But their home , of course , is in Los Angeles where the " heir " who failed to inherit from Wilson , makes legal fees and not a little political whoopee . The latter has attracted almost no attention since last September ( TiME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to political penury . But he has never endorsed the Brown Derby . So tense now is political battle that ears were strained last week to catch a McAdoodle . There was , for Brown Derbyism , a stillness ominous , yet not hopeless . Hoover had made his speech , in no sense a McAdoo progressive speech . Surely Smith could more nearly approach the progressive note . And if he did , might not McAdoo win the everlasting gratitude of an eager-to-win Democracy by saluting it . If he did , the effect upon the Dry South , upon the anti-Tammany West might be worth 1,000,000 votes . California is , by almost common consent , Republican , although not enthusiastically so .
