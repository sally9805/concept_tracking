Cuffs , kicks and curses was the order of the day in the Chambre des Dputs when Royalist Reputy Magne called canaille ( Scum , scoundrel , brat , riffraff ) in a loud voice , apparently at ex-Premier Painlev , who was reading from a large book of records . M. Painlev did not hear the serious imprecation hurled at him , but his friends insisted upon telling him about it . <P> Thereupon did the ex-Premier flush with anger , despite the fact that he is a professor of mathematics , a critic of the Einstein theory . He dropped the big book with a bang and with 20 of his Socialist colleagues he dashed across the Chambre to storm the Royalist benches . Six uniformed sergeants-at-arms rushed forward to stop the threatened mele ; one seized M. Painlev around the waist , but it was useless ; they were outnumbered . Blows , kicks , curses , cuffs rained in profusion . <P> Meanwhile , Premier Poincar was noticed to be " strained and nervous " ; MM . Daudet and Magne , responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cool , calm and collected despite the taunts of laches ( cowards , cravens ) from the crowded galleries . <P> Then President Peret seized his silk hat and suspended the session and ordered the galleries to be cleared . <P> Later , in President Peret 's office , M. Magne declared that the insulting word had not been intended for ex-Premier Painlev , but " as a simple commentary on dfaitists name given to the pacifists during the war like Bolo , Duval and Almerleda . " The insult had been provoked by M. Mandel . This explanation was made public in the Chambre and was accepted .
