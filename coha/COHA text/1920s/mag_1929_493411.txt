Washington Notes THERE are so many cross-currents in Washington these days , that at times it is difficult to keep a sense of direction . Also , there is a lack of stability about these alliances and antagonisms in and out of Congress that is more or less baffling to the normal mind . To cite one instance , there is the case of Mr. Alexander Legge , head of the new Farm Board . When Mr. Legge was first appointed , he was looked upon with considerable suspicion by the " friends of the farmer " in both House and Senate . He was haled before the Senate Agriculture Committee and heckled . The fact that he had been president of the International Harvester Company and was worth several million dollars was dwelt upon as a more or less sinister circumstance , and the Progressive Republican Senators assumed anything but a friendly attitude toward him , reluctantly acquiesced in his confirmation , and were filled with foreboding that it would turn out that all Mr. Legge wanted was to raise the price of plows , or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an almost complete switch , and the congressional critics of Mr. Legge from the agricultural belt have become his ardent . supporters in the controversy which has arisen between the Farm Board and the grain commission men , over the action of the Board in establishing a governmental wheat marketing policy calculated not only to stabilize the price but to eliminate the middleman . This suggestion aroused the commission men , and , headed by Mr. Julius Barnes , close friend of the efficient Herbert and man of large affairs , they have locked horns with Mr. Legge and the Board . In this controversy , the " friends of the farmer " on Capi- tol Hill appear to have completely shed their antagonism to Mr. Legge , and seem disposed to look upon him as a hot champion of the downtrodden and oppressed . W be the outcome of the clash between these twofrha friends will joifl December 25 , 1929 THE NEW , REPUBLIC 141 ' the President ? Mr. Legge and Mr. Barnes ? is not quite clear at this moment . However , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not , as has been suggested , take sides one way or the other ? which amounts , of course , to support of Mr. Legge and the Farm Board . There is certainly no other possible thing for Mr. Hoover to do . The published stories that Mr. Barnes 's intimacy was such as to insure enough White House pressure on Mr. Legge to cause a change in his course , were absurd on their face . Immediately following the application of such pressure , 1%/Ir . Hoover would have on his hands the large , flat and final resignation of the head of his Farm Board , who , less than any other man I know on the public pay-roll , would be pained by getting off it . Knowledge of this fact , plus appreciation of the position it would put him in to have the head of his Farm Board quit mad , after Herbert had declared him to be " the best man in the country for the job , " should be enough to deter Mr. Hoover from interfering on the side of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such circumstances , he would have considerable trouble getting a self-respecting man of any size at all to succeed him . But , in addition , I am credibly informed , Mr. Hoover really agrees in this matter with Mr. Legge , and the policy of the Board is the policy talked out between them either before or immediately after the latter 's appointment . There is not any difference of opinion between them on this score . They see , I am told , eye to eye on this subject , just as they interestingly entertain the same doubt as to the fundamental economic soundness of the whole Farm Board financial structure . In the judgment of both , what is being done is an experiment , and the best that can be done is to hope it will work out well . Notwithstanding these doubts , the Farm Board , with the Hoover backing , is going ahead as hard and as far as it can along price stabilization and cooperative marketing lines ? and the bucking of the esteemed Mr. Barnes will not slow up the machinery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political field , I regret to report that the Hon. Claudius Huston , the newly-chosen chairman of the reorganized Republican National Committee , is hitting one or two snags as he rambles along . He is not making the sort of progress he expected to make , and is , I hear , considerably discouraged . Of course , he has a difficult job . With a party split into three distinct Senate factions , it is manifestly impossible for him to launch forth in a publicity campaign to counteract the Democratic blasts of the flamboyant and calculatingly garrulous Shouse , who is pinch-hitting for the gallant Raskob . Obviously , if Mr. Huston rushed around making speeches and giving out statements extolling the greatness of Mr. Hoover and answering the attacks of the Democrats , he would make his situation worse , not better . He would inevitably and promptly be hammered by the militant Progressive Republicans on the one side and the aggrieved Old Guard boys on the other . Under the circumstances , there seems nothing for him to do except pursue a mole-like policy and a subterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the net result is nothing at all . National chairmen get nowhere without publicity . The idea that they can effect compromises between factions and " strengthen the party fences " by a series of " quiet conferences " is just so much bunk . The national chairman has exactly two real functions ? first , to raise money ; second , to put up a front for the party through the newspapers . So far as the first is concerned , I suppose Chairman Huston is getting along reasonably well , though that suit against him for a " loan " of $88,000 , filed in Washington last week by one Guy Standifer , of Oregon , has had a rather stunning effect upon certain members of the medicine-ball circle who had been most enthusiastic in describing the financial genius , substance , standing and station of Mr. Huston . Exactly what the suit is about , seems more or less shrouded in mystery , and nothing has appeared in the Washington papers since the first announcement . I am told nothing will . Mr. Standifer , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a " good sport , " a " corking golf player " and all that ? a man who is never afraid to back his game of golf or anything else to the limit . Those who know him well say that he had neither business nor political relations of any kind with Mr. Huston , and that the " loan " was entirely a personal one . The whole thing is mysterious . Probably there is a perfectly simple explanation for the suit , but if Mr. Huston has given one , it has certainly not appeared in the press , nor do any of his friends here appear to know it . When members of the Secretariat are queried on the subject , they simply look troubled and turn away . In the meantime , poor Mr. Huston is getting criticized for his failure to provide proper party publicity ? which , as has been pointed out , he can not possibly do without causing more trouble ? and he is being blamed for practically everything political that comes along . He has to be the buffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , he is compelled to be the goat for a lot of stories , allegations and rumors well calculated to annoy him and impossible to do anything about . If he had an efficient publicity department , such as Mr. Shouse carefully and at large expense equipped himself with before he took hold , Mr. Huston might better handle some of this stuff , not a little of which is entirely without substance or foundation . A sample is the story printed in various papers to the effect that Huston is the prime mover in a deep administration plot to induce Mr. Coolidge to come to the Senate from Massachusetts , the idea being that , if elected , he would be sidetracked for the 1932 presidential nomination . On the surface there is , of course , a certain spurious plausibility in a story like that . It can be written in a way , to make good copy , and it is the sort of thing that is avidly lapped up by unthinking people . To any thoughtful politician , however , the absurdities are so manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as put . out by an anti-administration source with the idea of making a little extra trouble for the chairman . The authors of tho story were careful to put in it no concrete statement that would afford any chance for repudiation or denial . The result is the complete inability of dr . Huston to do a thing. , He has got to sit and suffer . Furthermore , this story ? in which traces of the fine Italian hand of the Shouse burean can be clearly seen ? is neither the first nor the last that will appear to annoy Mr. Huston , who , through an 4. most unprecedented lack of publicity facilities , is in a more cr less defenseless fix . If it were not that he is disposed to take himself and his new post just a bit too seriously , and if he had not put out that rot about " business efficiency in politics , " and if he and his friends were a little bit more satisfactory , adequate and frank about that $88,000 suit-1 should feel a trifle sorry for Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame up as much stuff as they like on him without protest from me . So long as he is left without real publicity protection , the Democratic framers in the National Press Building can have a lot of fun with Mr. Huston . And it is not revealing any secret to say that such is their intention .
