HERMAN MELVILLE-Lewis Mumford-Harcourt , Brace ( $3.50 ) . <P> The Man . A white hedonist basking deliciously among South Sea Islanders and a sturdy Cape Codder poising his malicious harpoon over boiling seas , join incongruously in the popular impression of Herman Melville . As a matter of fact , he was born of eminently conforming New Englanders and but for a few glorious seagoing years , lived drably enough as an indifferent farmer , writing feverishly in the slack winter season . Failing as farmer , failing too as popular writer , he aspired to a post at some foreign consulate , but had to content himself with a job as customs inspector . He once described the post as " a most inglorious one ; indeed , worse than driving geese to water , " but at least it kept him near to the life of the sea and took care of his Manhattan houseful of wife and nondescript children . <P> Yet this is the man who , according to the present discerning biographer , " shares with Walt Whitman the distinction of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic , Moby Dick , is one of the supreme poetic monuments of the English language ; and in depth of experience and religious insight there is scarcely any one in the nineteenth century , with the exception of Dostoyevsky , who can be placed beside him . " <P> Epic . The sentimental cinema version of Moby Dick served as a reminder of the curious , thrilling story of Ahab , monomaniac . " A Khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great Lord of Leviathans was Ahab . " His was a terrific pride , and a consuming lust for vengeance on the White Whale . Moby Dick , who in malice , or in play , or accident , or instinctive self-defense had bitten off Ahab 's leg and left him humiliated , crippled , to hobble on a stump of whale ivory . " Ever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> A chase to the catastrophic finish , Moby Dick provides palpitating cinema material , to say nothing of a complete scientific compendium of whaledom . But far more than these it offers so excellent a parable on the mystery of evil that every man can read into it the drama of his own experience . " Mr. D. H. Lawrence sees in the conflict a battle between the blood-consciousness of the white race and its own abstract intellect , which attempts to hunt and slay it : Mr. Percy Boynton sees in the whale all property and vested privilege , laming the spirit of man : Mr. Van Wyck Brooks has found in the white whale an image like that of Grendel in Beowulf , expressing the Northern consciousness of the hard fight against the elements ; while for the disciple of Jung , the white whale is the symbol of the Unconscious which torments man , and yet is the source of all his proudest efforts . " Less tortuous is Mr. Mumford 's own interpretation : " The white whale stands for the brute energies of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the spirit of man small and feeble , but purposive , that pits its puniness against this might , and its purpose against the blank senselessness of power .
