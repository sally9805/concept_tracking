txt // because of their tendency improperly to hamper or re-strain competitors , or to lessen competition , questions of economic or business judgment are constantly involved . It is true that they are the kind of questions which the courts have for a generation been considering under the Sherman Law , but dissatisfaction with the courts was , as we have seen , one of the principal motives which actuated Congress in setting up an administrative tribunal . In the Clayton Act , the language more clearly suggests a non-legal criterion . rilile phrase " where the effect may be . . . to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly ill any line of commerce , " qualifies , in one form or another , all the prohibitions over which the Commission has jurisdiction , and it implies an exercise of economic or business judgment rather than a finding of law . This is true whether the phrase be taken to refer to the probable effect of the price discrimination , tieing contract , or other practice , under the particular circum stances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general economic tendency inherent in the practice under any circumstances. $ " Upon either interpretation , the ques tion involved seems particularly appropriate to the exer cise of administrative judgment . Experience with the Sherman Law has shown the futility of the attempt to find a strictly legal solution of the problem of monopoly and restraint of trade . The language of the Clayton Act seems to be a recognition of this experience , and the power of enforcement conferred on the Trade Commis sion strongly suggests the inference that Congress ex pected the Commission , with the aid and advice of the experts and examiners which it was authorized to employ , to exercise in its enforcement an administrative judg ment not necessarily guided by technical legal reasoning , and entitled as such to respect by the courts . Such being the apparent expectation of Congress , the // next question to consider is how far the Commission has availed itself of the opportunity offered . If we may take the somewhat oratorical pronouncements of its 1919 An nual Report at face value , the Commission itself has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the creation of the Commission , " the report says , " the courts had ruled upon various forms of unfair practices . Their decisions are designated as cases arising under the common law . But upon the creation of the Commis sion it was empowered to leave the shores defined by the common law and , taking the knowledge of those decisions with it , to embark on an uncharted sea , using common sense plus the common law for its compass . ' The re-port adds : " The legislative mandate thus far defined is broad enough to challenge the interest of the most am bitious , but when it is realized that the Commission must substitute a constructive measure for a destructive meas ure , revive an economic principle , or remove an uneco nomic factor , the task devolving upon the Commission and its legal department must appear almost overwhelm ing . Were it not for the efficient service of the economic department , the work imposed would be impossible . Once , however , the facts are investigated , established , and classified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the decisions of the Supreme Court , on the other hand , there is language which suggests a different point of view . " The words unfair method of competition , ' " said the court in the Gratz case , 8 ' " are not defined by the statute , and their exact meaning is in dispute . It is for the courts , not the Commission , ultimately to determine what they include . " And in the Curtis Publishing Com102 THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION pany case:90 " We have heretofore pointed out that the ultimate determination of what constitutes unfair com petition is for the court , not the Commission ; and the same rule must apply when the charge is that leases , sales , agreements , or understandings substantially lessen com petition or tend to create monopoly . " The implication is that both statutes set up a legal standard , rather than a standard dependent upon expert practical judgment , and perhaps that the Commission is only a " fact finding " body in a very restricted sense , with authority to make conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical facts . All questions of economic or busi ness judgment would thus be for the court to decide , and there would not be , as there is in the case of the Inter-state Commerce Commission , a range of " administrative questions " which are not in the strict sense questions of fact , but which are so peculiarly within the competence of the administrative tribunal that its conclusions , within reasonable limits , are respected by the courts . The question is of great importance , for if the Commis sion is , by these decisions , shorn of all power to exercise administrative discretion in matters of unfair competi tion or of restraint of trade and monopoly , it has become little more than a subordinate adjunct of the judicial sys tem . Perhaps , on the other hand , the language which I have quoted will be held to mean merely that it is for the courts to decide , ultimately , the limits within which prac tices may reasonably be held by the Commission to be unfair , or to substantially lessen competition or tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corresponding provisions of the Interstate Com merce Act.91 I will leave the subject for the present , and return to // it in a later chapter . For the problem is one which does not involve merely the formal construction of the language of a statute . It is necessary to inquire to what extent the problems with which the Commission deals from day to day do in fact involve the exercise of expert judgment , and to what extent the findings of the Commission indicate that expert judgment , rather than legal reasoning , has been used . In subsequent chapters , a review of the Commission 's findings will be made , both with regard to their form and general qualities , and in relation to the different types of controversies in which they have been made . From such a review it will be possible to obtain a clearer picture of the elements and scope of the problem . CIIAPTPllt III FINDINGS OF FACT THE published decisions of an administrative tribunal , like those of a court of justice , should fulfill two important objects . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the tribunal in a particular case , and they should afford an accessible collection of precedents by which its probable action in other cases can be forecast . The latter function is perhaps the more important of the two , especially where the tribunal is administering laws as general in their terms , and as important to the business world , as the Clayton Act and the Trade Commission Act . It was by the gradual accumulation of precedents and the slow evolution of principles tested by concrete cases , that the application of those statutes was to be determined . To the five published volumes of Federal Trade Commission decisions we therefore turn , to obtain an estimate of the character and quality of the Commission 's findings , and to ascertain how successful the Commission has been in giving content and vitality to the laws which it is administering . The published report of a decision of the Federal Trade Commission is made up of the full text of the Commission 's complaint , and of its formal findings of fact , conclusions of law , and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published , nor is there any summary of the respondent 's contentions or of the evidence presented on his behalf . It does not seem to me that this method of presenting the facts is fair to the respondent . It will be recalled that the Commission is itself the complainant in each case , and that it may not file a complaint until it " has reason to believe " that the person complained or has violated the law . In a provisional way , it // is compelled to prejudge every case that comes before it . The authors of the statute apparently believed that a just decision would nevertheless be assured by the provision made for hearings , and for opportunity to present evidence on behalf of the respondent . Yet the evidence so presented , and the contentions of the respondent , are buried in the official files at Washington , where only the curious inquirer can discover them . One who has not the time or opportunity to search the original docket , will naturally gain an opinion of the case from the published decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission as complainant , and the conclusions of the same Commission as judge . He will have no opportunity to ascertain from a survey of the evidence and of the opposing contentions , whether or not the conclusions are warranted , or appear to have been arrived at fairly and impartially . In defense of the Commission 's practice , it may be admitted that 90 per cent of the answers in these cases are probably not worth printing . Sometimes the answer is no more than a formal paper , three or four lines in length , advising the Commission that the respondent herein " now comes " and denies each and every allegation of the complaint . More often it is a long , wearisome document , full of the verbose ambiguities so dear to the expert pleader , formally admitting , denying , or professing lack of information or belief as to each allegation , seriatim , of the complaint . Only rarely does it serve to narrow the field of controversy or throw light on the issues as they appear to the respondent . I have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they appear in the Commission 's dockets , and the result has been to confirm a scepticism as to the value of lawyers ' pleadings in cases of this sort . Occasionally , it is true , there is a striking exception . It sometimes happens that an officer of a respondent company , treating the coinFINDINGS // plaint as a business communication , turns to his stenographer and dictates , out of his own experience and knowledge of the situation , a letter giving the facts and arguments which in his opinion justify the practice complained of . Such a letter is sometimes docketed as an answer , and it is apt to be refreshingly direct : Lnd informative , as compared with the run of lawyers ' pleadings . Probably the respondent 's attorney would consider it an unfortunate indiscretion . These are , however , exceptions , and , as a general rule , it may be conceded that little would be gained by encumbering the published reports with the text of the formal answers . It is not necessary to set forth the pleadings textually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side of a case , and the Commission 's failure to do so detracts greatly from the value of its published decisions . They are not only , for this reason , one-sided and unfair to respondents , but their usefulness as precedents is greatly impaired , for unless we know what facts or arguments were presented in defense , it is generally impossible to judge correctly the scope and application of the Commission 's decision . It should be observed , moreover , that formal findings are made and published only in those cases in which the decision supports the charges of the Commission 's complaint . Where the complaint is disproved , or the facts alleged are found not to constitute a violation of law , the complaint is dismissed by formal action of the board , but the text of the decision is not made public . In each volume of decisions there is an appendix containing a tabular list of " cases in which orders of discontinuance or dismissal have been entered . " The table shows the docket number and the name of the respondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razors " or " shoes " or " drugs and druggists ' sundries " ) . In another column there is a brief indication of the nature of the charge , // such as " false and misleading advertising " or " harassing competition " or " commercial bribery ( money and gratuities ) . " The next column shows whether the dismissal or discontinuance was upon trial , or stipulation , or on respondent 's answer . The final column is headed " Reason for discontinuance or dismissal , " but the entry in this column rarely goes beyond such scant phrases as " failure of proof " or " evidence not sufficient to support an order , " and in the majority of cases the entry is " no reasons assigned . " This failure to give to adverse decisions the same publicity as is given to decisions supporting the complaint is perhaps based upon a literal interpretation of the statute . Section 5 of the Trade Commission Act requires a " report in writing " only where the Commission , upon hearing , is of the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute . Yet the authority conferred in Section 6 ( f ) , " to provide for the publication of its reports and decisions in such form and manner as may be best adapted for public information and use , " is surely sufficient to warrant a detailed public statement of the facts and reasons warranting dismissal . To fail to make such a statement is manifestly unfair to the person complained of . If charges have been made which prove to have been erroneous , the respondent is entitled to an unequivocal and detailed exoneration . A mere dismissal of the case with " no reasons assigned " is not sufficient . And of course the reports suffer greatly , as a storehouse of precedents , from the fact that only decisions favorable to the Commission are published . Surely it is important that the business world should know what it may lawfully do , as well as what is found by the Commission to be unlawful . The next point that will occur to the student of the Commission 's published reports is the form which the " findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a " report in writing , " upon the facts of the case , there is no narrative statement of the kind usually included in the opinion of a court or commission . Instead there are formal " findings , " in numbered paragraphs , couched generally in the artificial legal phraseology of a common law pleading , and designed apparently to embody the Commission 's ultimate conclusions upon the major issues of fact or judgment thought to be involved , rather than to set forth the happenings or events or economic considerations out of which the controversy arises . Formal " findings " are a notoriously unsatisfactory means of conveying information . Almost any controversy , and especially an economic or business controversy of the kind that comes before the Federal Trade Commission , has a history , and a setting . To understand the business or economic significance of a practice , we must know something of its origin , of the objects and purposes of those who pursue it , of the persons who object to it and their reasons , and of its practical effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and direct language . Even a statement of the simplest occurrence suffers when it is couched in " legal " phraseology . To say that " for more than one year last past said respondent has given and offered to give employees of his customers and prospective customers , as an inducement to influence their employees to purchase . . . from the respondent , without other consideration therefor , gratuities consisting of liquors , cigars , meals , theater tickets and other personal property , " carries conviction only if we have full confidence in the judgment of the person whose conclusion it embodies . If the examiner would only tell us what happened , his finding would carry more weight . It would be better to say : " The evidence seems clearly to establish that the giving of gratuities on a large scale to employees of customers , was a settled practice of this respondent . Five of his salesmen took the 11O TIE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION stand , and of these all admitted that they customarily handed out cigars to buyers , took them to theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expendi tures of this sort were included in their expense accounts . Two of them admitted receiving express instructions from the head salesman not to be too moderate in making disbursements of this sort . The chief accounting officer produced the books of the company , and verified entries for spending money ' over $100 a week during the buying season . The president of the company , it is true , denied that any formal instructions to treat ' buyers were ever issued , and denied any intention to exert improper in fluence on employees of customers , yet in view of the acknowledged and long standing practice his denial can-not be given great weight . We conclude that the charges of the complaint in this respect are fully sustained by the evidence . " Such a statement would show the elements from which the Commission 's conclusion was reached , whereas the bare formal " finding " which I have quoted , does little more than to stimulate curiosity . Yet it is the phraseology in which the great majority of the " com mercial bribery " cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that a moving picture booking agency " has employed and used the following unfair method of com petition within three years last past and prior to Feb ruary 1 , 1918 : ( a ) Cancellation of contracts for the exhibition of certain moving-picture films made and entered into by and between certain of its competitors similarly engaged and the producers of moving-picture films : " or that the same agency " ( d ) by divers threats // and different methods of intimidation has induced the owners and operators of certain moving-picture theaters to pay this respondent a sum equal to 10 per centum of the cost of all moving-picture films of various producers booked directly from said producers or exchanges , " leaves the reader in the greatest doubt as to what has happened . ' Yet the docket , if we have the time and pa tience to examine it , reveals an interesting and significant story of the attempt of a powerful booking agency ( under the leadership of an officer who had since died ) to force independent theatres at Atlantic City and Philadelphia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " exclusive " contract which it tried to enforce , the attempt to persuade producers to boycott the independ ents , the point at which persuasion becomes coercion , and advice or suggestion becomes a threat , the extent of the economic power which made the threat effective , these were issues upon which , certainly , the judgment of the Commission might be expected to be helpful ; yet the formal findings of which I have given a fair sample do not even suggest that such questions exist . The Commission finds that " respondent . . . through and by its agents , servants and employees , has wilfully caused certain of its trucks to collide with automobiles owned and operated by said competitors . . . ( and ) that such collisions were calculated and designed to and did so damage the machines of the competitors as to hinder , delay and embarrass said competitors in the conduct of their business . ' " In the absence of any detail as to time , place , or circumstances , a finding of this kind is of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the company or a personal row between truck drivers ? Did it happen once or twice or constantly ? By whom were // the collisions " calculated and designed " to injure com petitors , or is this an allegation of law upon the theory of presumptive intent ? Upon these issues neither the reader of the Commission 's reports nor the reviewing court can get any assistance from the findings , yet they would seem to be of some importance . It does not satisfy our legitimate thirst for facts to learn that " numerous agents and representatives of re spondent . . . while acting within the scope of their em employment with the purpose , intent and effect of stifling and suppressing competition in the manufacture and sale of pumps , tanks . . . , " etc. , and " for the purpose of embarrassing , harassing and restraining competitors of respondent , . . . have by divers means and methods in duced and procured and attempted to induce and procure a large number of . . . customers . . . to cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet that is all there is to the " findings of fact " in the Milwaukee Tank Works case . ' This is not a report of facts , but a conclusion as to the existence of a practice , and even the practice is not so described that we can gain any concep tion of its scope , its effect , or of the means used in carry ing it out . Many similar cases could be cited . In one case there is a bare finding that " the respondents . . . entered into , engaged in , carried out , and conducted , a combination , conspiracy , understanding or pool ' among themselves as to which of said respondents should receive particular printing contracts submitted to them or brought to their attention for the purpose of bidding on the same and for formulating their respective bids so that the selected member of said pool ' would receive the business.75 There are no further details as to the nature or incidents of the alleged conspiracy . In a series of price maintenance // cases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that respondent " for more than one year prior to " a given date , " indicated the resale prices at which same should be resold and endeavored to have those prices maintained , " and ( 2 ) that respondent for the same period " refused to sell and did not sell its said products to jobbers , wholesalers or retailers who sold the same below such indicated prices . ' " The findings in some of the " passing off " cases merely inform us that the respondent made " certain statements " which were false and misleading and which " were calculated and designed " or which " tend " to deceive the public into believing that his product is that of a competitor. ? In a misbranding case8 the charge was that respondent ad vertised as " pure linseed oil equivalent " a product which it called " Flaxol . " Upon the vital issue of the falsity of the claim , the only finding is that Flaxol " is not the equivalent of " linseed oil . The ingredients and properties of the preparation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conclusion . Another respondent ' was found to have sent out letters and circulars " containing statements to the effect that certain competitors of re spondents were and are financially irresponsible , which statements were and are false and misleading and known by the respondents so to be . . . " The statements are not given , nor the facts which render them false . In the same case it is found " that the respondent has made false and injurious statements to prospective customers con114 THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION corning the material of which certain competitive cleaners are constructed and the cost of production of said clean ers . " The statements themselves are not given . In the Sears , Roebuck case , the formal finding is that respond ent circulated advertisements " which were calculated to lead the trade and the general public to believe that com petitors were charging more than a fair price for the same , " and other advertisements " in which it was rep-resented that respondent 's competitors did not deal justly , fairly and honestly with their customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining the docket , or the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals on petition to review.1 ' The typical way in which a violation of Section 2 of the Clayton Act is set forth , is by substantially repeating ( without more elaboration ) the language of the statute . Often all that appears is a finding that " the respond ent . . . for several years last past in the course of inter-state commerce has discriminated in price between differ ent purchasers of the commodity in question which commodities were sold by respondent for use , consump tion or resale within the United States . . . and that the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly . ' The typical finding that Section 3 of the Clayton Act has been violated , takes substantially this form : That the respond ent for several years last past has sold or made contracts for the sale of ( a given commodity ) and is now selling // or making contracts for the sale of ( said commodity ) and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or discount from or rebate from such price , on the con dition , agreement , or understanding that the purchasers thereof shall not use or deal iu the goods , wares , rner chandise , supplies , or commodities of a competitor or competitors of respondent , and that the effect of such sales and contracts for sale , or such condition , ngreeu ent , or understanding may be and is to substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly . " In the Standard Car Equipment Company case , " there is an interesting example of the manner in which a formal finding can be made to conceal a serious conflict in the evidence . From the docket , it appears that the case in volved a dispute between the Pennsylvania Tank Line and its former president . He organized a car construction company , and , according to the allegations of the com plaint , had been for more than a year last no occasion for their services , all " with the effect of stifling and suppressing competition in interstate commerce " in the leasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner sub mitted tentative findings that respondent had " enticed away the entire office force " of the Pennsylvania Tank Line at St. Louis , and had persistently , systematically , and on a large scale , enticed away employees of the Pe troleum Iron Works Company , an affiliated concern . The proposed findings gave the names of eight employees enticed from the Pennsylvania Tank Lines , and twenty-one from the offices of the Petroleum Iron Works , with the exact date , in each case , of the alleged enticement. // The respondent filed formal exceptions , and a brief in support , raising , by reference to the transcript of the testimony , serious doubts as to the accuracy of the pro-posed findings . Some of the employees named had , it was claimed , resigned of their own volition and applied for work without any solicitation from respondent . One had testified that he had been dismissed . Another was said never to have been in respondent 's employ at all , and yet another to have resigned to take a job with an elec trical contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually all of the persons mentioned , an issue of fact was raised , which , it would seem , the " re-port in writing " of the Commission should have analyzed and met . The following , however , is the revised version of the finding as it was adopted by the Commission : Par . 2 . That within three years last past respondents , for the purpose and with the effect of unduly harassing and embarrass ing a competitor in the manufacture , sale , and leasing of tank cars in commerce as aforesaid , maliciously enticed away em ployees of said competitor.16 In some of the cases one is appalled at the amount of time , labor , and money obviously expended in the in vestigation and trial of the facts , and at the meagre quality of the resulting findings . Thus in a case against an automobile company , 18 alleged to be selling its securi ties by means of fraudulent representations , both com plaint and findings charge , in a series of formally phrased paragraphs , that respondent has made false and mis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resources , assets , and financial standing of the com pany , and the manufacture , design , and production of its cars . The following is a typical paragraph : That during said period respondent Samuel C. Pandolfo , as // fiscal agent of said company , at divers times has made , published , advertised and circulated false and misleading statements , rep resentations , predictions , and promises relating to the design , production , and manufacture or a certain motor tractor , de-scribed as the " Pan Tank-Tread ' tractor . " 17 It is not stated what the representations are , nor in what respect they were false . The findings are practically worthless . Yet the docket shows that testimony was taken in this case for three days at Denver , two days at Monte Vista , Colorado , and four days at Minneapolis . The testimony covered 1056 typewritten sheets , besides two large volumes of exhibits . A year and a day elapsed between the filing of the complaint and the entry of the order . If the case was important enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was worth while to devote a little painstaking care to the preparation of a real statement of facts . The use of stock phrases to describe frequently re curring situations is noticeable in the reports , and is one of the unfortunate consequences of the formal character of the " findings . " The time element is generally indicated by a finding that " for more than one year last past , " or " for more than two years last past , " respondent has done the acts complained of . The phrase leaves it in doubt whether a continuous practice is involved , or occa sional acts spread over a period of more than two years , or whether there was only an isolated occurrence . The use of this phrase seems to have originated in the Reliance Varnish Works case , " and it reappears with distressing regularity in the findings in subsequent cases.19 A good illustration of the ambiguity of the phrase is in the Sears , // Roebuck case . The complaint in this case was filed Feb ruary 26 , 1918 , and charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two years last past . " The findings were made June 24 , 1918 , and recited that the sales of sugar below cost as a " leader " had taken place " for a long time prior to August , 1917 , and continuously during such period . " All the other acts were found to have been performed " for more than two years last past " ( apparently meaning for two years prior to the findings ? ) . The stipulation , however , upon which the findings were based , shows that the advertise ments complained of were issued principally in March and April of 1916 , and that none were more recent than August , 1917 . The dissenting judge in the Court of Ap peals thought this fact of sufficient relevance to warrant a reversal . Sometimes the finding is merely that the respondent " within the last three years , " or " prior to " a given date , " has given and offered to give " commercial bribes , or committed some other unfair act , again without specifica tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many occurrences are referred to.20 On the other hand , a // stock phrase that often appears where the examiner wishes to emphasize the frequency of an occurrence , is " systematically and on a large scale . " The phrase seems to have originated in the complaint iii the Botsford Lum ber case , 21 and perhaps appropriately described the con-duct of some of the respondents in that case , but the phrase , by itself and without further specification , sug gests a formal pleader 's allegation rather than a mirror of actual happenings.22 A favorite stock phrase , apparently used to fit almost any state of facts , is the allegation that certain acts were done " with the intent , purpose and effect of stifling and suppressing competition in interstate commerce " either generally , or in the sale of designated articles . The phrase suggests conduct involving some element of re straint of trade or of monopolizing methods , 23 but it is // most frequently used in cases involving commercial bribery , or misrepresentation , or even in simple " passing off " cases.24 Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of harassing and embarrassing its competitors and destroying their trade , " as in the Sears , Roebuck case ? a seemingly exaggerated characterization of a practice of selling sugar below cost for advertising purposes.25 The purpose of such a " finding " seems to have been to meet , argumentatively , the contention that the Commission had no jurisdiction over cases of mere fraud or misrepresentation , but that its powers related only to cases involving some kind of an assault upon competitive conditions , of the kind encountered in Sher-man Law cases . It resembles , in this respect , the " find ing " to be found in many of the later commercial bribery cases , that " the cost of making such expenditures be-comes a part of the expense incurred by respondent in distributing its products and is added to the price charged the purchasing public for such products , ' or similar language , the purpose being to meet the contenFINDINGS // tion that the Commission had no jurisdiction over these cases because they did not " affect the public . 727 Yet it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any effect as a finding of fact . The phrase about " stifling and suppressing competition " is little more than an epi thet , and , in some of the cases , is ludicrously inappro priate . Witness the solemn " finding " that the respond ent , by setting up a " Sweater Store " in the city of Washington , in simulation of the name of another store , " stifles and suppresses competition in the sale of men 's and women 's wearing apparel and knitted goods in the District of Columbia.728 The " finding " as to the effect of commercial bribery upon the price of the product may be relevant , but it is generally so phrased that , it is impossible to tell whether it refers to something which the testimony shows has actually happened , or whether it is no more than an economic conclusion of an argument mentative character . This is especially so where the " finding " takes the following form : " That as a result of the payment of such sums of money to employees as aforesaid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of money given by it as shown by these findings , and the price of its product to its customers is its cost of doing business plus its profit . ' An argument against the relevancy of such a finding may be that the economic conclusion which it embodies suggests a corol lary : that the employees who receive the bribes may in the long run be content with lower wages , and that there-fore the costs of the purchasing company may be reduced , with a corresponding reduction in prices . It seems , how-ever , that the public interest in the rooting out of this disgraceful practice does not depend upon a showing that // a few cents may be saved in the price of what the public buys . It is a striking fact that ambiguous and inadequate findings are most often encountered in cases in which there are agreed statements of fact . Sometimes the vice seems to lie in the Commission 's summary or interpreta tion of the agreed facts , a matter to which I shall return shortly . Frequently , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often apparent from the record that the stipulation is the product of compromise between attorneys . Doubtless a word is objected to and a substitute is suggested , and there is a deadlock which is finally solved by the use of an ambiguous or colorless phrase . It seems to be especially true of economic or busi ness controversies that a litigation upon an agreed state ment of facts is likely to turn upon the construction of phrases rather than upon inferences or judgments based upon actual facts . In the Wayne Oil Tank &; Pump case , and the Stanley Booking Corporation case , previously referred to , 30 the unsatisfactory character of the findings merely reflects an unintelligible or inadequate agreed statement . Even where the agreed statement is detailed and elaborate , one gains the impression that while it may represent an agreement of attorneys as to phraseology , it fails nevertheless to reveal that thorough comprehension of the facts which can only be gained by hearing wit nesses , by questioning them , and by examining at first hand the documentary evidence involved . The danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a picture of actual events and circumstances is illustrated by the Botsford Lumber Company case.31 Complaint was filed against more than a hundred lumber dealers in the middle // western and intermountain territory , charging a conspiracy to suppress the competition of mail order houses . It was alleged that through the medium of a trade periodical , a campaign had been conducted of which the object was to encourage sending to the mail order houses spurious requests for estimates and catalogues , with the object of causing them expense and embarrassment . The answers in general denied participation in any such conspiracy , denied that the trade periodical was the organ or representative of the respondents , and in so far as they admitted sending for estimates and catalogues , claimed it was for the legitimate purpose of obtaining information as to the prices the competing mail order houses were making , and not to cause them expense or embarrassment . After negotiations between counsel , however , all but a few of the respondents signed a stipulation of which the gist is in the following paragraph : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of them without concert or conspiracy with any one or more of the others , some of them with the purpose or intent of causing such mail order houses annoyance and delay in the transaction of their business , and damage and expense , and some of them without any such purpose or intent , and some of them with the purpose or intent of furnishing the information thus secured to the respondent Platt B. Walker for publication in the Mississippi Valley Lumberman , and some of them without such purpose or intent , has done or caused to be done one or more of the acts charged in paragraphs 8 and 10 of the complaint in this proceeding and for the purpose of this proceeding it is further agreed that each stipulating respondent consents that an order and decree may be entered against him or it within substantially , the terms hereinafter set forth . Another paragraph admitted that " some of stipulating respondents " have " systematically and on a large scale , " and " some " have occasionally and at infrequent inter124 TIE FEDERAL TRADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and catalogues ; that one object of these inquiries was to secure information as to prices ; but that " some " of the stipulating respondents " knew or are chargeable with knowledge " that the requests would cause expense and delay to the mail order houses . Obviously the stipulation contains no admission by any respondent that he has been guilty of any specific act of wrongdoing , but it contains a clause declaring that each respondent " does hereby waive all and every right each has to object to an order based upon this stipulation on the ground of indefiniteness or lack of precision in designating or stipulating the particular act or acts which each respondent has done . " The Commission 's trial counsel commented upon the clause at the final argument as follows : " Frankly and plainly the purpose of that waiver . . . is that in view of the fact that the specific act is not designated , not charged against a specific respondent , it takes a waiver of this sort to make the order valid against all of the respondents against whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legality of the order was saved by the waiver , it would seem that it should have been beneath the dignity of an administrative tribunal to act upon an agreed statement , of this character , obviously devised by astute attorneys with the sole view of giving the Commission a paper victory without conceding any facts against any particular respondent . An agreed statement of facts may be a convenient means of shortening a trial and avoiding expensive litigation , but an agreed statement of economic conclusions is seldom conducive to a clear understanding . It is not very helpful to have a complaint , a stipulation , and a formal finding unanimously agreeing that the effect of a contract " may may be to substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly , " but equally silent as to the subFINDINGS // sidiary economic factors which go to make up the con clusion.32 The examples which I have given show the " findings " at their worst , and while the percentage of cases of this kind seems to me to be large , I do not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , or even that they are typical . Especially in the later volumes there is a noticeable improvement , and a growing tend ency to eliminate vague phrases and conclusions , to give names , dates , and figures , and even in some cases to refer to the evidence in substantiation of conclusions.83 The form of the " findings , " however , remains the same . They are still formal pronouncements in legal phraseology rather than simple narrative or descriptive statements of happenings and circumstances . An examiner charged with making formal " findings " is apt to approach the task in the wrong frame of mind . He is apt to begin with // the legal conclusion which he wishes to reach . Next he will ascertain from the textbooks and precedents what conclusions of fact are necessary in law to support the result . Finally , if he is conscientious , he will comb the record to ascertain whether it contains evidence supporting the necessary conclusions of fact . A person charged with writing a narrative and descriptive account of a controversy approaches the task from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth as clearly and accurately as possible what has happened and what are the circumstances and surroundings . Having stated the facts , he will endeavor to reach more general conclusions of fact or judgment , and finally he will apply the law to these general conclusions . Throughout , he will be concerned mainly with the fairness and accuracy and impartial character of the report , rather than with its sufficiency in supporting one or another legal conclusion . Even the best of the Commission 's findings have an accusatory rather than a judicial tone , which , in the eye of the impartial reader as well as of the reviewing court , must greatly weaken their authority . In the instances which I have given it has generally been evident on the face of the printed reports that the findings were inadequate and unsatisfactory , whatever the evidence may have been on which they were based . To go further , and attempt to ascertain to what extent , as a matter of substance rather than of form , the findings correspond with the evidence , is of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the evidence is not summarized in the published reports , such a task would involve a study of the original records , including often voluminous testimony and exhibits . This study is concerned , however , with the Commission 's technique , and such examination as I have been able to make of original dockets , supplemented by the opinions of reviewing courts , reveals certain defects which appear to be directly // attributable to methods which seem to be mistaken . I will review a few such cases , with the caution , however , that only a small percentage of the dockets have been exam ined , and that the examples which I give may not be representative of the average . I may add , however , that I have examined in all 100 dockets , that the selection was made , of course , without any previous knowledge of what the search would bring to light , and that I have tried so far as possible to select for examination cases represent ing a large variety of subjects fairly distributed , in point of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will begin with a case in which we can test with a fair degree of certainty the quality of the Commission 's find ings , because it is possible to compare them Wit II an exhaustive review of the evidence in the opinion of an able judge of a reviewing court . " A complaint was filed against the Curtis Publishing Company , charging a vio lation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act , and also a violation of Section 3 of the Clayton Act . Upon the first charge , the only allegation in the complaint ( aside from formal averments relating to the corporate existence of the respondent and to its business in inter-state commerce ) was the statement that " with the intent , purpose and effect of stifling and suppressing competi tion , " the respondent refuses and has for several months refused to sell its publications to any dealer who will not agree that he will not sell or distribute the publica tions " of certain of the competitors of the respondent to other dealers or distributors . " Upon the second charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of Section 3 of the Clayton Act , including the formal aver ment " that the effect of such sales and contracts for sale , or such conditions , agreements or understandings , may be and is to substantially lessen competition and to tend to create a monopoly . " // The findings contain a few more details . It is found that the respondent " has entered into contracts " by which the dealers in question agree not to " act as agent for or supply at wholesale rates , any periodical other than those published by " the respondent , without its written consent ; that of such dealers , 447 were regularly engaged as wholesale dealers , and that of these " many " have requested the respondent 's consent to engage also in the distribution of " certain publications " competing with respondent , " which permission as to said competing publications has been uniformly denied by respondent . " Thereby , it is found , respondent has prevented and now prevents " certain " of its competitors from utilizing established channels for the distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these channels are " in most instances " the most efficient and in numerous cases the only medium for the distribution of such publications . A formal averment that the method of competition " has proved and is unfair " concludes the findings upon Section 5 . The findings as to a violation of Section 3 of the Clayton Act are in the identical words of those relating to Section 5 , except that the formal conclusion is " that the effect of said contract provision has been and is to substantially lessen competition with respondent 's magazines and tends to create for the respondent a monopoly in the business of publishing magazines of the character of those published by respondent . " Even as to the physical facts and occurrences upon which the controversy arises , these findings are vague and lacking in precision . The so-called " finding " that the contract " has proved and is unfair , " and that its effect " has been and is " to substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly , is the barest assertion of unsupported opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert a fact , or an economic judgment , or an opinion of law . Turn now , by way of eontrnst , to the // opinion of Judge Buffington , in the Circuit Court of Ap peals , where the case was carried for review.86 Observing that " an examination of these findings of fact shows that no findings whatever have been made in reference to the greater part of the vast volume of testimony in this case , " the court proceeds in an opinion thirty-five pages long to develop from the record what actually had oc curred . It seems that the Curtis Publishing Company had developed , in the course of years , a remarkable sales organization composed of young boys , mostly still in school , and employed on a part-time basis . The boys were organized into a league , membership being dependent in part on standing in school , as well as on efficiency in making sales . Local " teams " were organized , iii charge of distributing agents , and the educational features of the plan were entrusted to these agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably successful from the sales viewpoint , and in its educational aspect won the praise of as high an authority as Ex-President Eliot of Harvard University . It was correspondingly expensive to maintain ; in the four years from 1914 to 1917 alone it represented an investment of over $5,500 , - 000 . Naturally a few competitors began to cast hungry eyes on this sales system , and endeavored to persuade district managers to use the Curtis boys in selling their papers as well as those of the Curtis Publishing Com pany . Some of the district managers were regular news dealers , but the court found from an exhaustive review of evidence that what the competitors were aiming at was the appropriation of the sales system organized at much cost by the respondent . It was to protect itself against these would-be appropriators that the Curtis Publishing Company inserted the clause in its contract , and it was against them alone that it was enforced . // All this elaborate testimony appeared in the official records of the Commission . It was doubtless the view of the Commission that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint ; hence it was ignored in the findings . Another feature of this case must be mentioned . Under the terms of Section 3 of the Clayton Act there is a viola tion of law only if the transaction constitutes a lease , sale , or contract of sale . A mere consignment to an agent is not within the language of the section . Upon their face , the contracts between the Curtis Publishing Company and its retail distributors purported to be mere con-tracts of agency , contemplating sale on consignment . Whether they were what they purported to be , or whether , instead , they were disguised contracts of sale , was there-fore a crucial issue in the case , so far as the charge under the Clayton Act was concerned . It is impossible to con ceive that this issue was not clearly in the examiner 's mind when he prepared his findings . Yet this is what he found : " That in the course of such commerce the re spondent has made sales of its magazines to or entered into contracts for the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The use of the word " or " negatives the force of the first part of the finding ; the italicized phrase is a masterpiece of ambiguity . The text of the contract is not given nor are its terms set forth except as above stated . Both the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court subsequently held that the con-tracts contemplated an agency rather than a sale . The case strongly suggests that the examiner purposely used an ambiguous phrase to smooth over a defect in the proof . A case against a well-known mail order house illus trates the same weakness.3 " The complaint was issued on May 4 , 1920 , and charged that Montgomery Ward &; Com pany " has been within two years last past , and still is , " // offering for sale a liquid roofing cement advertised to con tain no coal tar , when in truth and in fact it does contain coal tar , " which respondent has well known . " The docket shows that on September 10 , 1920 , an agreed statement of facts was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report recites , " being in lieu of evidence , no test testimony being taken or other evidence offered herein . " The agreed statement " sets forth in detail that respondent had been purchasing the liquid cement in question for some time from a Cleveland manufacturer , and that the president of the Cleveland company had told the paint advertisement writer of respondent that the cement con tained no coal tar , and had suggested this as a valuable advertising point . On January 14 , 1920 , a representative of the Federal Trade Commission celled on officers of Montgomery Ward &; Company , and charged verbally that the product did contain coal tar . ' Pests were made by respondent , and the presence of coal tar was revealed . The company thereupon returned all the stocks on hand to the manufacturer , and has since sold only a product which contained no coal tar . All this appears at length in the agreed statement , stipulated by both parties , but it does not appear in the published findings . The findings aver that respondent has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale a liquid roof cement repre sented to contain no coal tar , " and that said representa tion was false , because said liquid roof cement did in truth and fact contain coal tar , all of which respondent knew or ought to have known . " The falsity and mislead ing character of the representation are emphasized by repetition in two paragraphs of the findings . Finally there is a statement that " there was no evidence to show that the respondent did in fact know that the said liquid roof cement did contain coal tar , " and that on or about January 14 , 1920 , " being informed by a representative // of the Federal Trade Commission of said false and mis leading advertisement " the respondent discontinued the further sale of the liquid cement in question . Nothing appears as to the source from which the cement was obtained , nor is the stipulated fact revealed that the rep resentations were made in reliance upon the statement of the president of the manufacturing company . Whether or not the order to cease and desist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the re spondent , and the phrase which I have italicized is both gratuitous and unjust . Somewhat similar is the case against Park &; Tilford , as distributor , and Louis Phillipe , Inc. , as manufacturer of a toilet preparation known as " Creme Angelus.738 The findings are based upon agreed facts embodied in stipulations of counsel . It seems that the product was made in New York City , and the whole output sold by the manufacturer to Park &; Tilford , in the same city . The stipulation recites that " since January , 1920 , the respondent , Louis Phillipe , Inc. , has not sold or shipped any of said products outside of the City of New York . " Park &; Tilford , however , sell the product in other states . The contract between the two concerns provided that Park &; Tilford should have full control of the advertising , as to subject matter , style , and arrangement , the cost , however , to be divided equally . Some advertisements ap peared in the daily press which gave the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An gelus " contained lemon juice , whereas in fact it contained no lemon juice , the ingredient being " oil of lemon , " made from lemon rind . The stipulation proceeds : // That shortly after Park &; Tilford took the exclusive sale of " Creme Angelus " it arranged with the advertising firm of Jules P. Storm &; Sons , Inc. , of 120 West 41st Street , New York City , which is a reputable concern , to conduct an advertising campaign with reference to said " Creme Angelus. " 1 n the course of this advertising campaign copy of an advertisement was sent to Park &; Tilford by Storm &; Sons which contained the statement that Creme Angelus contained lemon juice . Immediately upon this copy being submitted to Park &; Tilford the manager of its druggists ' sundries department notified Storm &; Sons that all reference to the fact that Creme Angelus contained lemon juice must be stricken from the advertisements . This was done , but through some inadvertence in the office of Storm &; Sons , the original copy went out and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained lemon juice appeared on two occasions , and on these occasions because of the inadvertence mentioned . It would seem that this succinct statement , stipulated to by counsel for the Commission as well as by respondent , should have appeared , as such , in the findings . It seems to show clearly that neither respondent had anything to do with the misleading advertisement , unless upon some legal theory of responsibility for the unauthorized acts of an agent or independent contractor . In the published findings , the agreed statement of facts is completely rewritten , and while , perhaps , if critically scanned , the findings contain no statement of fact inconsistent with the stipulation , the impression which they give is very different . Partly this is a matter of emphasis . Thus the stipulated fact that respondent has made no sales outside of the city is omitted from the findings , but appears inferentially in the finding that by the terms of the contract Park &; Tilford agreed to purchase the entire output of Louis Phillipe , Inc. , delivery to take place at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finding that the respondent , Park &; Tilford , " in promoting the lal THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION sale and distribution of these products , advertised the cleansing cream trade-marked Creme Angelus , ' on the 31st day of October , 1920 as follows : " The text of the advertisement follows . Subsequently there appears the following paragraph : Par . 6 . The advertising campaign of these products was con-ducted by a reputable advertising agency in the city of New York , under the direction of Park &; Tilford . During this cam paign Park &; Tilford gave directions to this advertising agency to omit from the advertisements statements that " Creme An gelus " contained lemon juice . Through an inadvertence on the part of the advertising agency , twice after notice were statements made that lemon juice was used in the preparations . There is a finding that the effect of the advertisements has been to mislead purchasers and the general public , and a conclusion that " the practices of said respond ents , " under the circumstances described , are " unfair methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as from the brief filed by the Commission 's attorney , it is apparent that the con clusion and order are based on a theory of respondeat superior . In the brief it is stated that : " The claim that the advertisements which contained the positive state ment that the preparation contained lemon juice , were inserted contrary to the instructions of Park &; Tilford , can not be relied upon by respondents as an extenuating circumstance , for the reason that the agency which had charge of the advertising was respondent 's agent , and respondents are bound by the act of such agent . ' And the brief points out that while Louis Phillipe , Inc. , is not engaged in interstate commerce , it is in law a participant in the illegal act because it paid half the cost of the advertising . A reader of the findings , however , taking // them at their face value , hardly gets the impression that the case rests upon such an artificial legal theory . Instead he finds the direct statement that respondent " advertised " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements mislead the public , and that " the practices of said respondents " are unfair methods of competition . The only extenuating circumstance revealed by the findings is that sometime during the course of the campaign Park &; Tilford directed that the reference to lemon juice be omitted . The essential fact that these instructions were given " immediately " upon receipt of proof of the advertisement , apparently before any advertisement appeared , is not brought out in the findings . It would seem in such a case that the published report of the case should clearly show that respondents have violated the act , if at all , only on a legal theory of respondent superior , and did not themselves participate in the deceptive conduct . I pass now to a case against a company not so well known as the respondents in the Montgomery Ward and Park &; Tilford cases , but nevertheless equally entitled to just treatment on behalf of the Commission . A complaint was filed against the Rockford Varnish Company , of Rockford , Illinois , charging that respondent , with the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for more than one year last past , has been , systematically and on a large scale , giving and offering to give to employees of customers and prospective customers , as an inducement to influence purchases , and " without other consideration therefor , " gratuities such as liquor , cigars , meals , theatre tickets , and entertainment . Another paragraph , in similar verbiage , charges secret payments of " large sums of money . " The findings set forth that respondent has " in several instances " given foremen finishers of furniture manufacturers meals , cigars , Christmas turkeys , etc. , and that " one of 1:3G TI3E FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION the purposes of said gratuities " was to induce them to influence their employers to make purchases from respondent . On one occasion , it is stated , a salesman of respondent offered to give " a certain foreman finisher . . . without the knowledge and consent of his employer . . . certain sums of money , " ? but that the offer was made without respondent 's knowledge or approval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat obscure statement that respondent 's relations with Rockford manufacturers ( the nature of which is not revealed ) " were not such as to relieve respondent from the necessity of competing for the trade of such consumers " with other varnish companies doing an interstate business . The order to cease and desist covers the giving of money as well as of other kinds of gratuities . While the findings are general , and , as to the giving of money , somewhat weak , they do not differ substantially from the findings in scores of commercial bribery cases in the Commission 's published reports . The docket , however , reveals a story which gives the case individuality and interest . It seems that Rockford , Illinois , has been for years a furniture manufacturing centre . The furniture companies are a community affair , often owned by the workmen themselves or by the descendants of former workmen , many of them of Swedish origin . Dissatisfied with conditions in the varnish trade , and especially with the practice of commercial bribery so generally prevalent , substantially all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which undertook to manufacture varnish in Rockford . From 92 per cent to 95 per cent of the varnish company 's business was local , although it tried at times , on the whole unsuccessfully , to get some business in adjoining states . Substantially , it was a community venture , owned and controlled by the local furniture companies and operated for their benefit . // It seems that the town of Rockford has always had the " picnic " habit . When the hot weather comes , someone organizes a party to spend a few days " at the lakes , " swimming and fishing . The general manager of respondent was often a leader in these outings . Ile would call up some of his friends , generally among the officers of the stockholding mills , often among their buyers , and suggest a trip to the lakes . The officer in question would gather together a few friends , generally among his employees , contribute his automobile , and the " party " was launched . There was of course nothing secret about the trips , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the parties included employees of respondent 's customers , there is no evidence in the record of any wrongful purpose . The expenses were generally Lorne by the participants , although on one occasion the Rockford Varnish Company paid a bill for a dinner at a country hotel , at the rate of 75 cents per guest . On another occasion , again with the full knowledge and acquiescence of their employers , the company sent to the finishing foreman in each stockholding mill a Christmas turkey . The only testimony as to the purpose of these gifts was that of the general manager , who said that since the varnish company was owned by the mills , it seemed a convenient conduit through which such expenses should be met . As to the offer of money referred to in the findings , the record contains the testimony of the buyer of a Grand Rapids furniture house that a Mr. Franklin , then a salesman of respondent , called on him and offered him a commission of $5 a barrel on all purchases , but that the offer was rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockford Varnish Company was that he had specifically directed his salesmen never to offer bribes , and that he had never heard of an instance in which the practice was indulged in . It was also an undisputed fact that Franklin 's salary was $100 a month , 1:is TIE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION and that his expense accounts , including railroad fares and hotel expenses , averaged only $142 a month . Franklin himself was no longer in respondent 's employ , and was apparently not available as a witness . Whether or not the evidence warranted the issuance of an order to cease and desist , is not here relevant . My point is that the record contained an elaborate and on its face fairly convincing defense , which should have been presented and disposed of in the Commission 's " report in writing " upon the facts , before respondent could fairly be held up to the public as a giver of commercial bribes . A case against an Ohio breeder of hogs is worthy of note , because the findings seem on their face to be unusu ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale an alleged breed of swine known as Ohio Improved Chesters , or O. I. C. 's , claiming that they were a distinct breed from the usual Chester Whites and superior thereto , and that two of the O. I. C. breed " weighed 2806 pounds . " Especial immunity from cholera was claimed for the O. I. C. 's . In fact , the complaint charged , they were no different from the Chester Whites , and were not peculiarly immune from disease . As to the 2806 pound hogs , the advertisements were said to give the impression that these phenomena were then or re cently in existence , whereas in fact two alleged specimens of the year 1868 were referred to . The findings cover nine printed pages , and contain much interesting information of a technical character as to the breeding and genealogy of hogs . It is found that all authors of national reputa tion on the subject , who have made personal investiga tions , state that the O. I. C. is only a " strain or type " of the Chester White , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livestock shows they are so classed , except // that some fairs , " induced to do so for financial considera tions , " give the 0 . I. C. a " special , " but not a " sepa rate " classification . The National Association of Swine Records refused membership to the 0 . I. C. Swine Breed ers ' Association , as such , on the ground that the 0 . I. C. was not a distinct breed . In support of this conclusion the findings invoke the cumulative testimony of " eminent professors of swine breeding , " of " practical prominent hog growers of National reputation , " of the Canadian Government , of federal and state officials , of local veteri narians , and of " the general public in and around Salem , Ohio . " The marshaling of evidence is on its face complete and convincing ; in fact , before the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case appeared41 I had tabulated the case as worthy of special comment because of its clear and apparently convincing findings . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals the following facts , shown by the evidence , but not alluded to in the findings : 1 . That L. B. Silver and his successors have claimed since 1870 that the 0 . I. C. is a distinct breed . 2 . That no one had taken any action to challenge the truth of this claim until 1916 , and again in 1918 , when complaints were made to the postal authori ties , which , however , failed of their purpose . 3 . That it was claimed by respondent ( though not proved , since the matter rested on tradition ) that the original O. I. C. was a cross between a Chester White and a Mammoth English hog . 4 . That whether or not this was so , " there is no conflict in the evidence that by careful selection and sys tematic mating he did accomplish a substantial improve ment in the original stock , and that the result of his efforts was a valuable contribution to progress in swine breeding . " 5 . As to what constitutes a distinct breed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irreconcilable conflict in the expert opinion evidence . " One group of breeders and experts took the view that where the blood line goes back to the foundation stock , there can not be a distinct breed ; another group , that a distinct breed may be established through inbreeding and selection . 6 . That the words " breed " and " strain " were used indiscriminately by many breeders , so that it was not of controlling importance whether the O. I. C. is a separate breed or a strain . 7 . That at time of the complaint there were registered in the herd book of the 0 . I. C. Swine Breeders , about 950 , - 000 hogs , whereas but 90,000 were registered in the books of the three Chester White Associations . The court concluded that regardless of the merits of the controversy , and even giving conclusive effect to the Commission 's finding that the 0 . I. C. was not in fact a distinct breed , the subject was one of long-standing scientific dispute , upon which honest opinions could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfair method of competition to express claims based upon either view of the controversy . As to the 2806 pound hogs , the opinion reveals that they have been featured in advertising for forty years ; that at one time the advertising read " two hogs weigh 2806 pounds , " but that some years before the complaint was filed this was changed to " two hogs weighed 2806 pounds . " As to this feature also , therefore , the complaint was vacated . In some other respects it was sustained . The case speaks for itself . It is obvious , whether the Commission or the Circuit Court of Appeals is right in its ultimate conclusions , that the Commission 's findings failed to give an adequate account of respondent 's defense , or even to mention the evidence given in respondent 's behalf . A complaint , was issued against the Wayne Oil Tank // &; Pump Company , 42 a manufacturer of automatic meas uring pumps , charging , among other things , that re spondent , with the intent , purpose , and effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods procured customers and prospective customers to " cancel and rescind orders and contracts " placed and made with competitors . The complaint also charged that respondent , with the purpose , intent , and effect ; of annoy ing , embarrassing , and restraining its competitors , sys tematically and on a large scale induced salesmen of its competitors to leave their employment , by offering them employment with the respondent . An agreed statement of facts was entered into , of which the first three paragraphs contain the formal state ments as to corporate organization and interstate busi ness contained in the corresponding paragraphs of the published findings . Paragraph 4 of the stipulation recites that " on numerous and divers occasions " the president , and the sales and credit managers of respondent have directed its sales agents , orally , by letter , and by circular , not to cancel or interfere with orders given to competitors , and " have discharged certain of its sales agents for dis obeying such orders and instructions . " Nevertheless , numerous sales agents , " while acting within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent , and effect of stifling and suppressing competition , have induced customers , " to cancel and rescind orders and contracts . " Paragraph 5 of the stipulation sets forth that for the past four years , respondent 's contracts with its district managers have , with one exception , contained clauses forbidding the district manager to hire employees away from competitors . It admits that on one occasion a district manager was employed who had within a month pre viously thereto resigned from the employment of a com142 TIE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION peting manufacturer of pumps and tanks . It sets forth , however , that within two years last past , district managers have employed and attempted to employ salesmen of a competitor for the purpose of injuring the competitor in the conduct of its business . In the findings , based solely on this stipulation , there is no reference whatever to the instructions to salesmen not to procure cancellations of orders , nor to the discharge of sales agents for disobeying the instructions . Nor is the clause in the contract with district managers mentioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of numerous of its sales agents , who were acting within the scope of their employment , . . . with the purpose , intent and effect of stifling and suppressing competition . . . has by divers means and methods induced and procured " the cancellation of orders and contracts of competitors ; and that respondent " through numerous of its district managers , while engaged within the scope of their employment , has within two years last past employed and attempted to employ salesmen and sales agents of a competitor of respondent , well knowing that such salesmen and sales agents were then in the employment of such competitor . " Here again the finding is obviously based upon the doctrine of respondeat superior , a doctrine apparently deemed applicable even where the principal has done his best to prevent the commission of the wrongful act by the employee . Yet even if it was right as a matter of law , surely the examiner was not justified in suppressing important parts of the agreed statement of facts , which strongly tended to lessen the gravity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exoneration , and which showed flint the intent to harass competitors and stifle competition was not an actual intent entertained by the managencent of the company , but an intent imputed to them by n fiction of law . // A complaint was filed against the firm of Korb &; Dwyer , dealers in secondhand typewriters and adding machines , charging that they had advertised for sale " several hundred rebuilt , first-class Dalton Adding and Listing machines , " whereas in fact they lia ( l on hand only a small number of such machines , and had no way of procuring several hundred as advertised . The only ma-chines they had on hand were alleged to be not " rebuilt " but merely " overhauled . " Obviously the case turned largely upon the correct technical meaning of the phrases " rebuilt " and " overhauled . " The Cornn-is iom made a finding that " the word rebuilt ' as applied to secondhand adding machines has a well-known meaning , especially to the adding machine and typewriter trade , so that an add ing machine may properly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is stripped down to its base and then built up , replacing parts that have been worn by new parts , and building into the machine at the same time any refinement and improvements made since it was manufactured . " 43 It found that the leading adding machine manufacturers made it a practice not to sell new parts , so that as a practical matter , only the Dalton Company could , properly speaking , " rebuild " its own secondhand machines . It found that the false advertise ment was inserted " for the purpose of misleading and de ceiving the purchasing public . " Examination of the testimony shows that the definition of a " rebuilt " adding machine was based mainly on the testimony of sales representatives of the Dalton and Burroughs companies.44 A member of the respondent firm , on the other hand , testified that in his opinion a " rebuilt " machine was one in which wornout parts had been replaced by serviceable parts , either new or second-hand , provided they were in good condition . I am not // suggesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is wrong , although it would seem that the finding would be entitled to more weight if it gave some reason for preferring the testimony of one witness over that of another . But it does seem that a full and fair " report in writing " should have mentioned the fact , fully established by the evidence , that at the time they inserted the advertisement , Korb &; Dwyer held an option ( secured by a cash deposit ) on 600 secondhand Dalton machines from the General Adding Machine Ex-change , which was a corporate subsidiary used by the Burroughs Adding Machine Company in disposing of secondhand machines " turned in " for new ones ; and that the letter from the Burroughs subsidiary confirming the option referred to the machines as " 600 rebuilt Dal-ton Adding Machines . " Yet this important piece of testi mony , which strongly tended to impeach the Commis sion 's conclusion that the use of the word " rebuilt " was false and misleading , was not mentioned in the finding . The reader will have noticed that in several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex clusively of an agreed statement of facts stipulated by counsel on both sides . Where facts have been formally stipulated it seems elementary that formal findings should set forth the facts as stipulated , or at least that where any portions are omitted for the sake of brevity or be-cause deemed immaterial , the omission should be clearly indicated in the findings . Often the findings are in fact verbatim reproductions of the agreed statement of facts.45 // Yet in a distressingly large number of cases the ex aminer seems to have felt himself privileged to rewrite the agreed facts , leave out what is unfavorable to the conclusions which he desires to reach , and even to make additions and alterations which substantially change the meaning or emphasis of the statement . And this is clone without any indication on the face of the published find ings that the agreed statement is altered . All that appears is the recital in the preamble that counsel for the re spective parties have made an agreed statement of facts , and have stipulated that it may be treated as the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made its findings . I have given some examples , but more can be added . A complaint against the Albany Chemical Cotripany46 charged that upon expiration of The Bayer Company 's patent for " aspirin , " and the cancellation of the name as a trade mark on the ground that it had become merely descriptive , respondent had procured the registration of the name on its own behalf with numerous state au thorities , and was falsely claiming in its advertising that the word was its registered trade-mark property . An agreed statement of facts substantially admitted the charge , but added that the registration of the word " Aspirin " by the respondent was made on advice of counsel ; that as soon as the matter was called to the com pany 's attention by the Commission , the practices were abandoned ; and that respondent is now as rapidly as possible abandoning the registration of the name.47 The findings follow the agreed statement in substantially the // same language , except that the defensive matter above summarized is wholly omitted . In another case48 a maker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tires were guaranteed to give 4000 miles ' service , and would be replaced at half price if they failed to do so , the implied representation that they would in fact run 4000 miles being alleged to be false and misleading . I give in parallel columns the paragraph of the stipulation , and of the findings relating to this charge : Par . 4 of Stipulation . That a circular was distributed under the name of Akron Tire Co. , Inc. , containing an advertisement representing substantially that if a tire failed to give service of 4000 miles , such tire would be replaced at one-half the price paid ; that the advertisement tended to create the belief and impression among users of automobile tires that the said tires sold by respondents could be expected to give a service of 4000 miles ; that many of them did give such service ; and those which did not , were replaced by respondents on the receipt from the customer of one-half of the original purchase price . Par . 6 of Findings of Fact . That a circular was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , containing an advertisement representing substantially that if a tire failed to give service of 4000 miles , such tire would be replaced at one-half the price paid ; that some of the tires did give this service , and that those which did not were replaced for one-half the original purchase price , but that the advertisement tended to create the belief and impression among users of automobile tires that the said tires sold by respondents could be expected to give a service of 4000 miles . It will be noticed that by a rearrangement of clauses the emphasis is completely changed . One is tempted to // ask by what warrant the examiner felt himself entitled to change the word " many , " which I have italicized in the stipulated facts , to the word " seie , " similarly itali cized in the findings . Although the stipulation above quoted obviously destroys the Commission 's case upon this point , an order was nevertheless entered to cease and desist wording its advertisements so as to give the im pression that its tires could reasonably be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial bribery case49 the complaint was issued May 13 , 1921 . The answer was an informal letter of the vice-president of the company , admitting that his com pany had once indulged in the practice , but stating that he was in thorough accord with the Commission 's at-tempt to root it out , and maintaining that he had suc ceeded in stopping the practice , so far as his company was concerned , in the summer of 1920 . Paragraph 4 of the agreed statement concludes as follows : " That the respondents assert that since June , 1920 , such practices by this company and its salesmen have been discontinued and that since that time they have not used such practices in connection with their business . " The findings set forth in detail the stipulated facts as to wrongdoing in 1919 , but omit all reference to the claim that the company had of its own initiative discontinued the practice almost a year before the complaint was issued . In a case against a mail order lumber house50 it was charged that respondent had circulated as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Trade Commission against some lumber dealers . ' The stipulated facts admit that the report was // a gross misrepresentation of the order , but go on to say that the advertisement was " unauthorized and undig nified " and that " distribution of the circular was imme diately stopped for that reason when the fact of its existence became known to the officers of respondent . " Specifically , it is agreed in the stipulation that the dis tribution stopped on August 1 , 1918 , being nearly four months before the complaint was issued . The findings give the text of the circular , state that it is false and mis leading , and a gross misrepresentation , but fail to reveal the stipulated fact that it was unauthorized , and was dis continued as soon as its existence became known to re spondent 's officers . Instead there is a finding , totally unsupported by anything in the stipulation , that the ad vertisement " was calculated and designed to , and did , deceive the trade and general public . " Paragraph 6 of the stipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made by re spondent , ending with the statement that such representa tions " were not wholly true , and did unfairly tend to mislead purchasers and the general public . " The rep resentations are set forth in five separate sub-paragraphs lettered ( a ) to ( e ) , respectively . The same paragraph , lettering and all , appears in Paragraph 5 of the findings , but carefully edited by deleting all matters favorable to respondent . Thus sub-paragraph ( a ) admits a representa tion that " the United States Government vouches for , and guarantees the reliability , honesty and business methods of respondent , " but adds , in parenthesis , that " no representations to this effect have been made since February , 1916. ' 2 This latter sentence does not appear in the corresponding sub-paragraph of the findings . In-stead there is interpolated a clause , not included in the stipulation , " that such statements carry the impression // that the Post Office Department censors respondent 's advertising matter . " The stipulated matter omitted flatly contradicts the statement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representations have been circulated " for more than two years last past . " Sub-paragraph ( e ) , in the stipulation , admits a representa tion that respondent saves for purchasers from $200 to $500 per building as compared with prices of " regular " dealers . The stipulation adds , in parenthesis , " Respond ent has received numerous letters from its customers , many of which have come unsolicited , in which letters statements are contained that in certain cases such sav ings have been made . " In the corresponding subpara graphs of the findings the matter in parenthesis is omitted . The concluding sentence in the stipulation , ad mitting that the statements " were not wholly true , " is completely rewritten in the findings , and much strength ened and elaborated . In the same case there is a finding that respondent , " for more than two years last past , did offer to pay to local contractors , builders , and carpenters a bonus or so-called commission without the knowledge of the pur chaser or consumer , as an inducement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of re spondent 's lumber and building materials over those of its competitors . 763 The phraseology is like that of a com mercial bribery case . The only evidence to support it , however , is Paragraph 5 of the stipulation , which shows that offer of a commission was made on a printed form of cash certificate , that the payment of such commissions is a common practice , and that " only two ( 2 ) per cent of the allowances were paid to contractors without the knowledge of consumers . " A case against a manufacturer of underwear , 64 at Ben150 THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION nington , Vermont , illustrates the same tendency to take liberties with stipulated facts . The complaint charged that respondent , " with the effect of stifling and suppressing competition in the manufacture and sale of underwear in interstate commerce , " had branded as " Men 's merino shirts , " and " Men 's natural wool union suits , " certain underwear " composed but partly of wool . " An agreed statement of facts was entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which admitted the practice complained of , and admitted that the brands and labels " may tend to mislead the purchasing public " into believing that the goods were made wholly of wool . In defense of the practice , however , the stipulation set forth that the custom of using the brands in question is " general and universal in the trade , " and specifically , " that the word Merino ' as known in the underwear trade , signifies a fabric composed of a mixture of wool and cotton . " The stipulation adds " that there are a few manufacturers of underwear whose products are composed wholly of wool , and are branded and labelled by them as All Wool ' . " The findings set forth the practice as admitted in the stipulation , and concede that there has been for twenty years " a general custom and practice " to use such labels , throughout the United States , although the stronger word " universal , " in the stipulation is omitted . The findings , however , omit completely the sentence which stipulates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwear trade , " signifies a fabric composed of a mixture of wool and cotton . " The stipulated fact that a few manufacturers of underwear composed wholly of wool label their produce " All Wool , " is altered to read : " that there are a few manufacturers of underwear whose products are composed wholly of wool and are branded and labelled by them as such . " Perhaps the stipulation was improvidently entered into by counsel , but that is no reason for disregarding altogether an // agreed fact obviously destructive of a part of the Com mission 's case , or for rewriting a part of the stipulation so as to alter its sense materially . In the case just mentioned there was at least a ref erence , though an inadequate one , to the respondent 's defense , but in Federal Trade Commission v. Brown , Durrell Company , 66 decided as late as April 1 1 , 1923 , a long paragraph of the stipulation containing a similar defense , and showing that respondent had abandoned the practice nearly three years before the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings . hi another re-cent case , also , 66 the stipulated fact that , the practice had been abandoned " at least six months prior to the issuance of this complaint " was likewise omitted from the findings . A complaint was filed against a shorthand correspond ence school , which used the Pitin.utic system , charging that it had circulated false and misleading statements concerning its business and the business of competitors.67 One charge was that the respondent had circulated a pamphlet entitled " Government Reports on Pitmanic and Gregg Shorthand Writers , " and containing false and misleading matter , and statements erroneously purport ing to be from government reports . The stipulation con-ceded that the pamphlet contained what purported to be an extract of a report of a " New York High-School Committee , " or the " Shorthand Section , High-School Teachers ' Association , " and that " this association was and is a private organization composed of individual high-school teachers and was and is not a public or ganization or governmental agency , except insofar as shown by the report . " The stipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such committee are stated on // pages 5 and 6 of said circular . . . " In the findings the words which I have italicized , obviously damaging to the Commission 's case , are omitted . In another folder re spondent had said that " the Government stenographers who draw the big salaries , who hold positions paying $5000 or more a year , " use the Graham-Pitman method . Referring to this , the stipulation admits that " It is not a fact that the official stenographer for any United States court receives a salary of $5000 or more per year , " but qualifies the statement by adding that " some reporters and stenographers who report for Government depart ments make more than $5000 per year in salaries and fees and other emoluments . " The admission as to court re-porters appears in the findings , but the qualifying clause , which affords some justification for advertisement com plained of , is omitted . Finally , the stipulation embodies more than five pages of matter , showing that respondent had , on hearing of the objections raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , promptly eliminated all objectionable matter from its advertising . All this is likewise omitted in the published findings . In a misbranding case58 the findings follow verbatim an agreed statement of facts , with one exception . Para-graph 6 of the agreed statement sets forth that " while the aforesaid trade name and trade mark of Sol Satin ' so used by the respondents may not have been adopted and used by them in bad faith for the purpose of fraudu lently deceiving the public , nevertheless the use of the word satin ' . . . tends to deceive and mislead the public into the belief that the said fabric . . . is made either wholly or partly of silk . " In the findings the words above italicized are omitted . This is the only respect in which the finding differs from the agreed facts . // In a proceeding against a small producer of moving picture films58 the only evidence was an agreed statement stipulated by respondents . The findings recite that the respondents had purchased old films , changed the names and titles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " that the substitution of new names was done " with the intent , purpose and effect of stifling and suppressing competition in the motion picture industry , " and " furthermore , " that it was " calculated and designed to and does deceive the general public into the belief " that the films were new . Examination of the stipulated facts shows that the only admission was that the old films were exhibited under new names and titles " without designating and advertising said motion picture films to have been old films and reissues . " Nothing appears in the stipulation as to the intent , purpose , and effect of stifling competition , nor as to the calculation and design of deceiving the public . In a complaint against an Ohio concern " the charge was that respondent was selling as " second run " linseed oil and " second run " turpentine , products adulterated with low grade mineral oils . Paragraph 3 of the agreed statement of facts sets forth that there is no such product as " second run " linseed oil , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product is composed of 45 per cent linseed oil , 10 per cent turpentine , and 45 per cent mineral oil ; and that " the use of the term second run ' as applied to linseed oil may possibly tend to mis lead the purchasing public into believing that linseed oil sold and advertised as second run ' is a pure product and not an adulterated product . " Paragraph 3 of the findings sets forth the same facts , except that the quoted // language is changed to read : " That the use of the term second run ' misleads the purchasing public into believ ing that linseed oil sold and advertised as second run ' is a pure product . " In Paragraph 4 , relating to turpentine , similar changes are made : the stipulated fact that the use of the term " second run " applied to turpentine " may have a tendency " to mislead the public , is changed into a finding that it " misleads " the public . In the same para graph of the agreed statement , the stipulated fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold by it as pure and unadulterated turpentine " is totally omitted from the published findings . The complaint against a maker of disinfectants61 charged the circulation of an advertisement purporting to quote an official report of the Public Health Service condemning " drip machines " as toilet disinfectors . In fact the excerpt was from a paper of a private physician , published as a matter of information by the Health Serv ice , but not officially endorsed . The complaint also charged the circulation of letters " to the public " referring to drip cans as frauds . An agreed statement was drawn up , and it was stipulated by counsel that it should be taken " as all of the evidence " in the case . One offending letter and " not more than two or three similar letters " 62 were admitted to have been sent by the Eastern General Man ager of respondent , and the misleading circular was ad mitted to have been sent out from both the Chicago and New York offices . As to the circular , the fact is stipulated that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , by publishing the article of Dr. Thomas R. Crowder in the bulletin , intend to endorse all of the statements made by him , " respondent had caused // all the circulars in question to be destroyed . This is omitted from the findings . As to the letters referring to drip cans as frauds , the agreement recites : " that the re spondent himself , whose home , general office and place of business is in Chicago , Illinois , did not know that , his agent had sent out the above named letter or letters of a similar character to other persons ; that when complaint was made to him ( the respondent ) that such letters were being sent out he directed his agent not to write or send out any other such letters as the one above mentioned ; that the agent has complied with the instructions given by the respondent and has not sent out any such letters since he was so directed . " Not a word of this appears in the published findings . In a case in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy Paints " a product not in fact made for the Government or upon government specifica tions , the stipulation admitted the facts charged , but set forth that respondent realized immediately afterwards that the advertisement was misleading and gave orders to discontinue it . In response to all inquiries resulting from the advertisement , he sent the prospective purchaser a blank which set forth that the paint was " our special brand . " " Said respondent used the aforesaid acknowl edgment blanks , " continues the stipulation , " to give notice of such facts to the prospective purchasers of said paint . " In the findings this is changed to read : " Re spondent used said acknowledgment blanks because he realized that the said advertisements were misleading and improper . " In this way a fact stipulated as evidence of respondent 's good faith was made to appear as a con fession of wrongdoing . A case against the American Hosiery Company83 is in teresting , because it shows that the Commission itself // had , upon second thought , some compunctions as to the manner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings . The case involved mis branding of goods composed partly of cotton , and Para-graphs 1 to 4 inclusive of the agreed statement of facts contained a frank admission of the practice . Paragraphs 5 to 8 inclusive exonerated respondent of any deliberate intent or purpose to mislead the public ; showed that his descriptive price lists clearly revealed the presence of cotton in the goods in question ; and that the misleading brands in question had been in general and customary use among underwear manufacturers for the past twenty years . The findings , as at first made by the Commission , included , substantially verbatim , Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the stipulation , but omitted all reference to Paragraphs 5 to 8 . Two months later , however , amended findings were issued , which included all eight paragraphs of the stipu lation , adding only the conclusion , not admitted in the stipulation , " that the tendency of said labels to mislead the public , entails interference with fair competition . " Finally , mention may be made of two cases against the Standard Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Commission 's conception of the nature of an agreed statement and of its findings of fact . The complaint in one case ( Docket No. 85 ) involved un fair practices in the sale of petroleum products . In the other case ( Docket No. 133 ) unfair acts against compet ing makers of tanks and pumps were involved . A variety of practices were alleged , including division of territory with other Standard companies , " direct " sales to con sumers , and threats of such sales , for the purpose of " punishing " or intimidating local dealers ; loaning tanks and equipment on condition that they be used exclusively in handling respondent 's product ; misrepresentations as // to the quality of its products and disparaging statements concerning competitors ; causing " cancellation " of orders placed with competitors ; and sales below cost . There were also general charges under Sections 2 and 3 of the Clayton Act . In fact , the complaints include most of the offenses that could be brought within the scope of the Commission 's jurisdiction . A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings were held , and a stipulation of facts was entered into , to " stand in lieu of testimony , the same as though testified to by competent witnesses , and if approved by the Commission , it I shall be and constitute all the evidence in the case . " The stipulation disposes of a number of the charges of the complaint . Thus Paragraph 4 covers four pages , and is devoted to the charge of selling direct to consumers as a means of punishing retailers . The paragraph admits that the company has established filling stations " from which sales are made direct to consumers , but sets forth that its officers , if called , would testify that they established such stations only where there was reason to believe that they would be profitable . Paragraph 5 , covering three pages , admits that certain witnesses , if called by complainant , would testify that sales agents of respondents had used threats and other unfair methods , but that the sales agents , if called , would deny such testimony . It is set forth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith issued orders that no such threats or false statements regarding competitors would be tolerated . A preamble to the findings recites that the " agreed statement of facts " was submitted to the Commission , subject to its approval , by " the attorneys for the respective parties , " and that the Commission " approved all the agreed statements of facts except paragraphs 4 and 5 for the purpose of this proceeding only . " These are the paragraphs favorable to the respondent , men158 THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION tioned above . The findings are devoted solely to the practice of leasing tanks and pumps at nominal rates with " exclusive " covenants . The reader of the Commission 's published reports can not tell whether the serious charges of the complaint , spread at large over seven pages of the printed volume of decisions , have been withdrawn , or disproved , or whether they are perhaps true but for some reason are not pressed . They are simply ignored . The stipulation in Docket No. 133 contains a full description of the practice of leasing pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following : " that the practice of leasing , tanks and their equipments , requires a large capital investment in such outfits and equipments . . . that there have been and are many of the smaller competitors of respondent and its competitors who did not and do not engage in such practices ; that many of such smaller competitors have had , and have small capital and assets and would not have been able , and are not now able to invest the capital in pumps , tanks and their equipment that is necessary in conducting either of the above business practices . " The same language appears in the findings adopted September 12 , 1919 . A year later , for some reason that does not appear , the findings were amended by omitting the quoted language . It is not quite clear what purpose was served by striking out of the formal findings a fact admitted in an agreed statement of facts . I have devoted perhaps an undue amount of space to these comparisons between stipulations and findings , but they will serve to show the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters favorable to respondents , and interpolating findings which are thought to strengthen the Commission 's case . Of fifty-seven cases involving stipulated facts in which I have examined the original docket , twenty-seven cases have revealed important , discrepancies . Nost of these cases have been a nnFINDINGS // lyzed in this chapter , so that the reader can judge for himself the nature of the alterations . In fifteen more cases there are lesser alterations , omissions , or interpolations , but the revision is on the whole a fair one . la fifteen of the cases examined the findings conform , word for word , to the stipulated facts . Where the respective attorneys have agreed as to the facts to be embodied in a formal stipulation , it seems only fair to the respondent that the whole stipulation , and nothing else , should go into the findings , or at least that if any part is omitted , or anything added , that fact , should clearly appear in the published report . The reader is entitled to know what part of the findings the respondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpolations of the Commission . Often the findings , after setting forth in detail the representation or other practice in question , will end with a finding that such representation is " false and misleading " or that such practice is " calculated and designed to harass or embarrass competitors . " The preamble recites that the findings are based on an agreed statement , and the reader gets the impression that not only the representation or practice is admitted , but also its falsity or improper purpose . In fact , the characterization does not appear in the stipulation , but is merely the Commission 's conclusion from the facts stipulated . There is no reason why the Commission should not draw such a conclusion , where it is warranted , but the report should show that it is an inference , and not an admitted fact . The unsatisfactory character of many of the Commission 's " reports in writing " is , of course , greatly enhanced by the fact mentioned at the beginning of this chapter , that the answers of respondents are not included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respondent 's defense is given . Instead , the findings appear in immediate juxtaposition with a coin160 THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION plaint , in which sweeping charges are made , bristling with phrases about the intent , purpose , and effect of suppressing and stifling competition , the calculation and design of deceiving and misleading the public , and the intent to create a monopoly . For the use of generalities and stock phrases of this character , frequent enough in the findings , is even more prevalent in the complaints . By way of illustration , of the seventy-one complaints published in Volume I of the Commission 's decisions , forty contain at least once the phrase " with the intent , purpose and effect of stifling and suppressing competi tion , " or variations thereof . In one case it is repeated six times , 65 in another nine times , 66 in another twelve times.87 Where the complaint contains serious charges , and is published in full in the reports , it is all the more important that the published findings should clearly dis pose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a number of cases , however , serious charges in the complaint are completely ignored in the findings . I have already mentioned the case against the Standard Oil Company of Indiana.68 In a more recent case69 the complaint was against two respondents , one a manufacturer of women 's wearing apparel and the other a retailer in the city of Washington . The charge was that some coats had been sold by the manufacturer to the re tailer , and by the retailer to the public , on the false rep resentation that they were made of " Salt 's Peco Plush , " a proprietary brand . The complaint ascribed guilty knowledge to the retailer as well as to the manufacturer . At the trial , the retailer 's representative testified that he bought the coats from the manufacturer in good faith // on the representation that they were made of " Salt 's Peco Plush , " and expert witnesses were called to show that it was impossible to tell , except by the most minute examination , that the goods were not as represented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge , exonerated the retailer of any wrong inten tion . The Commission 's attorney endeavored to establish that the retailer had continued the sale even after he had been informed of the fraud , and the examiner 's tenta tive report so found , but upon exception this finding was eliminated . The order finally adopted refers only to the manufacturer . The charge of willful fraud against the retailer is ignored , and it does not even appear that the complaint , as to the retailer , was formally dismissed . Surely a retail merchant who has been charged with dis honesty by a government agency is entitled to an explicit public vindication if the charge is not proven . In other cases we find the following charges , embodied in the published complaints , not mentioned in the pub lished findings : false representations , by misquotation of public records , as to the contents of a patent claim ; 70 false representations that respondent was " closely affili ated " with a competitor ; 71 obtaining a patent by means of " false and misleading " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments of money to employees of cus tomers to influence purchases ; 73 refusal to sell organ rolls except to purchasers of respondent 's pipe organs ; 74 simu lation of the name of a competitor ; 75 concerted price // maintenance by competing salt manufacturers ; 78 and payment of gratuities and traveling expenses to public officials to induce them to purchase road machinery . " There is no valid reason why the Commission should not in all cases , as it has done in some , 78 admit frankly in its findings that some or all of the charges of the complaint were disproved at the trial or withdrawn by the Com mission 's counsel . I have analyzed in this chapter a substantial number of cases in which , either from excessive zeal or from a fail ure to appreciate the true function of a judicial state ment of facts , the examiner or attorney who drafted the findings has produced a report which is flagrantly de fective when compared with the evidence or the stipulated facts . I repeat again the caution which I have previously expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reader should not jump to the conclusion that all the findings are similarly defective , or that the Commission has a settled policy of impartiality . Doubtless a great deal depends upon the calibre of the examiner or attorney in charge of the case , and there are many cases in which a desire to be fair and impartial is apparent . But the num ber of the cases in which the findings are manifestly un fair is sufficient to seriously impair the value and relia bility of all the findings . And regardless of accuracy and fairness , the formal character of the findings , the use of " legal " phraseology and of ambiguous words and stock phrases , and the frequently obvious attempt to frame // findings with a view to the legal result desired , rather than as a mirror of events and circumstances , ? all these tend to make the findings unsatisfactory and unconvincing , and to explain in some degree the scant respect with which they have been treated by some of the appellate courts . CHAPTER IV DECEPTIVE AND DISIION EST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which the Federal Trade Commission arrives at its findings of fact , and have commented on the form and quality of the findings . In this chapter and the next I will attempt a more detailed appraisal of the output of the Commission in the different types of cases which it has handled . The cases will be classified according to the nature of the practice involved , and the inquiry will be , as to each type of practice , what contribution the Commission has made toward the substantive development of the law , and whether the procedure to which the Commission adheres is such as to enable it to deal satisfactorily with the practice in question . The cases divide themselves conveniently into two major categories : those which involve an element of fraud or dishonesty , and those which involve practices not dishonest , but for some other reason supposed to be restrictive of fair competition . Cases in the first category arise exclusively under Section 5 of the Trade Commission Act , while cases in the second category arise either under that section , or under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clayton Act . Without attempting any academic catalogue of frauds , some preliminaries may be helpful before turning to the specific dishonest or deceptive practices with which the present chapter is concerned . When a citizen has been induced to part with his money by false representations , he is the person primarily injured , and it is his protection that has been the main // concern of the host of punitive laws and ordinances designed to punish commercial fraud . The criminal law punishes one who obtains money by false pretenses ; federal statutes protect consumers against misbranding or adulteration of foods and drugs ; against the use of the mails to defraud ; against deception by improper grading of certain agricultural staples . State statutes and local ordinances give protection against dishonest advertising , fraudulent weights and measures , and similar forms of commercial fraud . The Federal Trade Commission , however , is not a general censor of business morals . It can take cognizance of a dishonest practice only if it is a competitive practice in the course of commerce as defined in the statute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting or tending to affect a competitor , appears to be beyond the Commission 's jurisdiction . It is concerned with the consumer only because the consumer is in the long run benefited by honest competition . Although the approach is different , the field covered is nevertheless much the same , for it is rare that a deceptive practice in the course of commerce is not a method of competition . Two men are commercial competitors when they are endeavoring to fill the same commercial wants by offering the same or similar goods . Any practice , device , or course of conduct adopted by either to improve his relative position as compared with the other , or to prevent the other from gaining on him , is a method of competition . It may be aimed primarily at increasing his own sales , or it may be aimed at hindering the sales of the competitor . In either event , if the method used is deceptive , it is an unfair method of competition . Accordingly it is not surprising to find that the Federal Trade Commission has encroached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative agcnc.ies . Deception in the course of commerce is the // foundation of the jurisdiction of courts of equity in cases involving trade marks and trade names , and " unfair competition " in the narrower sense of the word . The prevention of fraud , no less than the preservation of health , is the basis of the pure food and drugs acts , and of the many similar police measures , both state and federal , already referred to . For this reason it is especially important to estimate fairly the extent to which the Cornmission is fitted , by its powers and procedure , to deal with such cases , and whether it is expending time and energy upon cases which can more effectively he handled elsewhere . TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES I wrza , begin with those cases , familiar to all lawyers , in which a manufacturer or dealer complains that a competitor is simulating his trade mark or trade name , or by some other form of misrepresentation is causing confusion among customers as to the origin or identity of the goods they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may lead the customer to think that the goods he is buying from the competitor were in fact made by the complainant . Or it may lead the customer to think that the competitor , rather than the complainant , is the manufacturer of all goods sold under the brand in question . In either case good will belonging to the complainant has been wrongfully appropriated and the public has been deceived . The wrong may be aggravated where the competitor sells , under the complainant 's brand , a grossly inferior article , thus in effect representing that all articles sold under that brand are equally poor in quality . Although analytically they are closely allied , in considering available remedies it is necessary to distinguish between cases in which the simulation is of a registered // trade mark , and where it is of a trade name or device not registered . Where a mark , affixed to goods sold in inter-state or foreign commerce , is eligible for registration and has been registered under the Trade Mark Act , it is pro tected by a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dispute as to the right to use a trade mark ( in view of its possible interference with another mark previously in use ) , the question may be adjudi cated , in the first instance , according to prescribed pro cedure , by an examiner in the Patent Office , with a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Patents , and to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia . Or it may be determined in a litigation in the district court , between the adverse claimants , the registration being in such cases prima facie evidence of " ownership . " In such a case the jurisdiction of the district court does not depend upon diversity of citizenship , nor upon the amount in controversy . Where an infringement is found to exist , the infringing mark may be denied registration , or its registration canceled ; further use of the infringing mark may be enjoined ; where there is guilty knowledge , any wrongful profits derived from the infringement may be required to be accounted for ; and damages may be awarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , up to three times the proven losses sustained by the plaintiff . Infringing labels and wrappers may be de stroyed by the court . In addition state courts have con-current jurisdiction , often aided by special statutory provisions . Where the mark is one which can not be registered as a technical trade mark , or where the simulation is of the form , size , color , or other distinctive attribute of the complainant 's goods , the statutory procedure is not available . A court of law , however ( whether state or // federal ) , will give damages in a proper case for injury sustained on account of the fraudulent attempt of a com petitor to pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff , or the plaintiff 's goods as his own . A court of equity will enjoin such conduct , and will generally grant incidental damages . Where diversity of citizenship exists and the amount in controversy is sufficient , the litigation may be conducted in the Federal courts ; otherwise the state courts are available . In a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that where nothing further is involved than a claim of infringement of a patent , ' copy-right , ' or registered trade mark , ' the public interest does not warrant the issuance of a complaint , in the absence of important countervailing considerations . The rulings refer to the fact that special remedies are provided by Federal law in such cases . They are not , apparently , based upon any doubt as to the Commission 's jurisdiction but upon an exercise of discretion in view of the ade quacy of other available remedies . In several instances , however , the Commission has carried through to final order cases in which the violation of a registered trade mark appears to have been the gist of the offense charged . A maker of rebuilt automobile tires , for instance , was ordered to cease and desist from using the firm name " Racine Tire Sales Company , " or the trade name " Multi-Cord " because they were found to infringe reg istered trade marks of the Racine Rubber Company . ' A milliner was ordered to cease doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name " Louise , " be-cause it conflicted with the registered trade name " Marie // Louise.76 A chemical company was ordered to cease sell ing disinfectants under the name " B-D Bacilli-Destroy , " because it infringed the registered trade name " B-K Bacilli-Kill.77 In a fourth case the situation was re-versed : the Commission ordered the respondent to cease using a trade mark which he had duly registered in the Patent Office , on the ground that it infringed an unreg istered trade name previously adopted and used by a competitor . ' A much larger number of cases involve simulation of names of competitors or of their products , not registered as technical trade marks . There are conference rulings in which it was held that where the use of the simulating name had been discontinued , and assurance received that it would not be resumed , it would not be in the public interest to issue a complaint . ' The mere fact that there is a remedy by a suit at law or in equity , in state courts , and where jurisdictional requisites exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for refusing to act in such a case . There are twenty-four such cases in the reports covered by this study , ' ? and in many of them // the records are long and much time seems to have been spent by the Commission 's investigators and attorneys in their preparation and trial . Some of these cases seem on the face of the record to concern themselves with matters of but slight public consequence . One case in which a complaint was issued , testimony heard , briefs filed , and a formal decision rendered , involved a fancily quarrel over the right to use the name " Phillips Old Ti-ue Sau sage " in the District of Columbia . " In another ease it appears from the findings that one Sammons operated a " Shade Shop " in the District of Columbia , on premises leased from the respondent , by profession a wall paperer . There was a disagreement , and Sammons threatened to move out , and started to remove his signboard . This in censed the respondent , who drew " a deadly weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop . Thereafter he refused to speak to Sammons , and " continued this atti tude of hatred and malice " to the point of opening a competing business under the name " Shade Shop . " He was ordered to cease and desist from using the misleading name . " Z It is not clear what there was in the case to call for the intervention of a federal administrative tribunal . An order of the Commission in a simple " passing off " case has been sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals in one circuit , 13 but the court was of course concerned only with the Commission 's legal jurisdiction . The // wisdom of a proceeding by the Commission in cases of this kind seems to me to be open to serious doubt . Where a manufacturer or distributor claims that his goods are being simulated by a competitor , he has full redress in the courts , and can generally be relied upon to take all necessary steps to put a stop to any deception of the public incident to the infringement of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the public interest is likely to go by default . Moreover , the Commission is generally quite unable to give an adequate remedy to the complaining party . To deal effectively with these cases , a tribunal moist be in a position to do two things . Where there is a real dispute as to the substantive rights of the parties , where , for instance , each party claims in good faith the right to use a trade name or design , the tribunal must be in a position to render a decision which is just , impartial , and binding on the parties . Where , on the other hand , the rights of the complainant are clearly established , the problem is one of enforcement , and the tribunal must be equipped to compel prompt and complete obedience to its orders , and to secure effective redress for past injuries . The Federal Trade Commission can not properly perform either of these tasks . It can not determine disputed substantive rights , for its decisions are rendered in an ex parte proceeding , and are obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controversy . The Commission may solemnly decide , after the most exhaustive investigation and prolonged hearing , that A has the prior right to use a certain trade device , and that B is infringing . The decision may be affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon petition to review , and by the Supreme Court on certiorari . Even then there is nothing to prevent B from instituting a new litigation against A in the courts , trying all the issues of fact over again , and perhaps , by presenting somewhat different evidence , obtaining a decision contrary to that // reached in the Commission 's case . Nor is the Commission any better fitted for the task of affording protection to private rights which are undisputed or clearly established . Suppose that the manufacturer of a well-known brand of automobile tires finds that a " pirate " concern is fraudulently simulating his name or product , and appeals to the Federal Trade Commission for protection . The Commission will send out an investigator for a preliminary report . The report must be approved by the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a commissioner , and finally by the Commission as a whole . If the decision is favorable , a complaint will issue , and the respondent has thirty days to file his answer . I n due course ( perhaps not for several months ) the case comes on for hearing and testimony is taken . Time is then allowed for the filing of briefs and reply briefs , and , if the respondent desires , there is oral argument before the Commission . The case is taken under advisement and after further lapse of time a decision is reached and an order issued . Yet even now the pirate dealer is under no legal compulsion to cease his dishonest practices . He can continue with impunity to simulate the applicant 's brand . It is only when a petition has been filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals , the transcript remitted to the court , public hearing held , and a decree issued by the court , that the proceeding acquires any " teeth . " It will be unusual if such a decree can be obtained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of the original application to the Federal Trade Commission , and during that whole year the applicant may be losing business to the dishonest competitor . As an effective protection against the pirating of trade names or brands such a procedure is of course useless , and it becomes ludicrous when compared with the remedies which an ordinary court of equity can administer in such a case . If instead of appealing to the Commission the manufacturer files a bill in equity in the // state or federal court ( as the case may be ) , he can within a day or two , if the case is clear , get a restraining order or preliminary injunction , which can be violated only at the risk of paying a fine or going to jail . Such an inter locutory decree will generally put an end to the matter , and the offender will turn his talents into other channels ; but even if the suit is contested the manufacturer can in a proper case be protected by the preliminary injunc tion during the whole course of the litigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for past infringement , or even for willful in fringement after the order has been issued , nor can its order be made the basis for a suit for damages in the courts . In an equity suit in the courts , an award of damages or an order to account for profits derived from the infringement may be made as a part of the decree awarding an injunction . The argument is sometimes made that there is a legiti mate place for the Federal Trade Commission in cases of this sort , as the protector of the weak against the strong . A large corporation , it is said , can hire eminent lawyers and experts , and prolong the litigation until the strength and resources of the small competitor , whose private brand the corporation is trying to appropriate , have been exhausted . The difficulty with this argument is that , in the cases in which complaints have been issued , the object has as often as not been to protect a large , nationally known company against a small but unscru pulous competitor . Among the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. F. Goodrich Company , 14 the Universal Battery Company , " the Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Company , " the Vacuum Oil // Company , 17 and the Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Com pany . " These companies would hardly admit that they were applying , in forma pauperis , to have the Govern ment assume the expense of their private litigations . The only other argument I have heard to justify such a pro ceeding by the Federal Trade Commission was advanced by the complaining witness in the United Allegretti case.19 It seems that one Allegretti had achieved fame as a maker of candy , and that the witness ' company claimed to be the only true heir to the name and business . There were , however , at least eight different concerns , some composed of relatives and others merely of compatriots , in business under the well-known name . " We can not be iii court all the time with the different Allegrettis , " said the com plaining witness . " It is an impossible tiling to do , and for that reason we appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72O Such a bill of peace against the tribe of Allegrettis is perhaps useful , yet it seems doubtful whether the public interest was suffi sufficiently involved to warrant interference in the premises by a government agency possessed of such inadequate powers . Perhaps , however , a similar argument is applicable to a case against two enterprising taxi drivers in the Dis trict of Columbia who had themselves listed in the tele phone directory under fifty different names of taxi com panies , some closely resembling the names of competitors , others in imitation of concerns in other cities . " One of the local competitors secured an injunction in the District of Columbia courts , but the Commission took action on // behalf of the others , and ordered respondent to cease and desist from listing the same business in the telephone book under more than one name . What has been said as to trade mark and " passing off " cases applies with equal force to another group of cases , in which the complaint is that the respondent has cir culated false statements concerning a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ob tained from chemists an analysis of a competitor 's prod uct , and circulated it in the trade with comments of his own not strictly accurate . The Commission issued its complaint , found that the comments were false and mis leading , and ordered respondent to cease and desist.22 A manufacturer of lightning rods was ordered to cease and desist from circulating " any false or disparaging state ment , comment or criticism concerning the business or business method of any competitor , " the controversy arising out of a dispute with a named company.23 Again , a manufacturer of automobile tires and rims was ordered to cease applying the term " pirate " to a competitor who made spare parts designed to fit respondent 's rims.24 These cases are similar to the " passing off " cases in that they involve unfair acts aimed at specific named com petitors ; that these competitors , in so far as their cases have merit , have adequate remedies at law or in equity ; and that the powers and procedure of the Federal Trade Commission are ill adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake . Mention should be made at this point of a case which raises a more difficult problem . In Federal Trade Com mission v. Liberty Paper Company25 it appeared that the Liberty Paper Company was an established and wellDECEPTIVE // known manufacturer of gummed paper . The respondent was a dealer in paper bags and toilet papers , and pro ceeded to do business under the same name . Ile was ordered to cease and desist from using the name " Liberty Paper Company " as a trade name . The facts suggest a line of cases which have given the courts in the United States much trouble . It has always been said that a trade mark will be protected only against unauthorized use upon goods of the same kind . To use the classic example , the mere fact that one man stamps a lion on his iron products will not prevent another from stamping a lion upon his linen goods.28 It has been supposed that this rule requires that the owner of the trade mark and the in fringer be competitors.27 Yet the injustice of the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinctive name " Aunt Jernima . " By dint of advertising and persistent use he has induced the public to associate the name with his product , the quality of which is recognized . Suppose , now , that a second manu facturer should begin to sell " Aunt Jemima Pancake Syrup , " a third " Aunt Jemima Baking Powder , " a fourth " Aunt Jemima Yeast . " Obviously , the public would be deceived into thinking that the original Aunt Jemima Company had branched out into allied lines , and the new appropriators of the trade name would be reap ing the benefit of the original manufacturer 's reputation and good will . It is true that the appropriators would not be directly diverting customers from the owner of the trade name , but the injury would be none the less serious . As long as a man has the exclusive right to use the dis tinctive trade name to which he has given value , he re-mains in control of his own business reputation . But as // soon as anyone can use the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the quality be good or bad , the reputation of the trade name is at the mercy of persons whom the owner can not control . The argument , therefore , that no property in terest of the owner of the trade name is infringed seems unsound . The weight of authority is now clearly that a vendor of an allied though non-competitive art ? , cle may be en-joined from appropriating another 's trade name.28 The character of the goods manufactured by the alleged in fringer seems relevant only upon the issue of fact , whether or not there is substantial deception . Even the most gullible customer is not likely to think , from the similarity of brands , that a prominent iron manufac turer has branched out into the linen business . But he is likely to think that " Overland " tires are produced by the maker of automobiles of that name , 29 or that " Pens lar " cigars are made by the owner of a brand of " Pens lar " drugs and chain store supplies.30 So far as the jurisdiction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning does not , however , fully meet the situation . If the owner of the trade name and the infringer are not competitors , the latter can not be guilty of unfair competition toward the former . The Commission has no jurisdiction over mere conversion of property , whether tangible or intangible , // from one who is not a competitor . If the Commission has jurisdiction over such cases , it must be because the prac tice is unfair to the competitors of the appropriator , rather than because it is unfair to the owner of the trade mark . The Liberty Paper case , therefore , falls more appro priately within the class of cases next to be considered . Of the cases previously discussed the distinguishing feature has been an attempt by dishonest means to divert customers from a specific and identified competitor . We turn now to a group of cases in which the deceptive prac tice is not directed against any ascertainable competitor , but is designed to promote the sales of the person en-gaging in the practice , at the expense of his competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations . MISBRANDING GOODS OFFERED FOR SALE IN a leading case , it was held by the Circuit Court of Ap peals for the Sixth Circuit ( Circuit Judges Taft , Lurton , and Day ) that a manufacturer could not be enjoined from misbranding his goods , at the suit of a vendor of com peting articles which were honestly branded.31 The facts of the case were peculiar . The plaintiff produced under the name " Aluminum " washboards faced with that mate rial . The plaintiff was , moreover , the only manufacturer of aluminum washboards in the United States , having an exclusive contract with the sole producer of the metal . It was charged that the defendant was selling under the name " Aluminum " a washboard made substantially of zinc , and containing no appreciable trace of aluminum . The district court awarded an injunction , but the decree
