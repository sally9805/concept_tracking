When , last week , Knox Hat Co. , Inc. , announced an offering* of no par , non-voting common at $140 a share , a few U. S. hat wearers remembered the time ( 1917 ) when Knox shares were selling at $6 . That was during a reorganization period following the retirement ( 1913 ) of Colonel Edward M. Knox , son of Founder Charles Knox , and before the arrival of the present management , which , under the leadership of President F. H. Montgomery , showed net earnings in 1928 of $859,997 , or $10.10 a share on common stock . Acquiring Dunlap &; Co. ( 1919 ) , Long 's Hat Stores Corp . ( 1927 ) , Kaskel &; Kaskel Corp . ( 1928 ) , Knox Hat Co. , Inc. , today operates 62 retail stores as well as distributing Knox and Dunlap hats through some 2,500 agencies . Net sales in 1928 were $8,141,323 . <P> Hats . The felt hat , as everyone knows , is made from rabbit fur . According to ancient Chinese legend , the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tired Chinaman . This Chinaman , rabbit hunting , had caught several rabbits . <P> In catching the rabbits , however , he had tramped many a mile , and sore and painful were his feet . So he skinned two of his rabbits , put their fur in his shoes , and quickly eased his throbs and burnings . <P> How this experience resulted in felt hats rather than in felt shoes , legend does not relate , but it is undeniably true that the raw material for felt hats is the little animal with the long ears and the reputation for timidity and fertility . The straw hat lacks a romantic legendary origin , but includes in its ranks probably the world 's most expensive hat-the Panama-handwoven from fibres of palm leaves in Ecuador and priced up to $500 . Knox sells about a half dozen a year of the $500 variety . <P> Heads . The hatter deals with heads as much as with hats , and many a famed head , including the heads of 23 U. S Presidents , has been protected and ornamented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird's-eye view of heads and in the Knox files are thousands of outlines ( technically known as " conforms " ) of heads as they appear when looked straight down at . Generally speaking , there are two main types of outline-a long , narrow ellipse hardly wider at the centre than at the ends , and a short , pear-shaped figure with the wide part at the back . Long and narrow were the heads of Theodore Roosevelt , Robert G. Ingersoll , Victor Herbert . Short and pear-shaped were the heads of Ulysses S. Grant , Charles Frohman , General Phil Sheridan . <P> Calvin Coolidge 's cranium shows a distinct bump on the left side and William Howard Taft 's has bumps on both sides . <P> Manhattan 's Jimmy Walker has the narrow oval head ; Pittsburgh 's Andrew Mellon is pronouncedly among the pear-heads . <P> Knox men say that judges and generals have usually the same shaped heads . <P> The average hat size is 7 ? . Among average size takers are Calvin Coolidge and Al Jolson . John D. Rockefeller Sr. wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The largest hat ever made was a special order from a Ringling Brothers Giant , who weighed 480 pounds and took an 8 ? . There is not much variation in straw hat styles , straws of the present ( delayed ) season tending toward a narrowed brim and a slightly bell-shaped crown .
