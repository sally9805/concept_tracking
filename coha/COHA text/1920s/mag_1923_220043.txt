A case which it is estimated will ultimately involve close to $100,000,000 and will certainly affect tremendously the housing situation in New York City was decided by Mr. Justice Tierney of the State Supreme Court . <P> In Hermitage Co. vs . Goldfolge he held that the tax exemption law of 1920 , one of the Emergency Housing Laws of that year , is unconstitutional . The statute became a law September 27,1920 , and has been twice amended , but never challenged . All building in New York City since its passage has been done upon the belief that the structures erected would be nontaxable for 10 years . <P> In the Judge 's opinion the law violated the provision of the State Constitution which prohibits " granting to any person , association , firm or corporation an exemption on real or personal property " by means of " a private or local bill . " While his stand must have required an admirable degree of courage , there is considerable substance to the accepted opinion that he fell into error and there is an ample basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The legal point is a close one . The statute , as amended , authorized the legislative body of any town or city to grant tax exemption until January 1,1932 , to the owners of all buildings used for dwelling purposes which were completed after April 1 , 1920 , or commenced before April 1 . 1923 , and completed within two veal 's thereafter . Thus , unless all counties or cities availed themselves of the privilege granted by the law , it might have a local application . But ordinarily for a bill to be considered a local or private bill it must be limited to a particular locality , individual or thing . As tax exemption might be general or local , according to the action taken by the counties or cities , the law is not a purely local one , and there is reason to believe that the appellate units will not consider it to be such . It has already been referred to favorably by a higher court .               @ @ @ @ @ @
