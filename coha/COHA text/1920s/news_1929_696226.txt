txt The huge yellow monoplane in which three French fliers will attempt a fast flight to Paris is ready for the start . The last preparations were completed yesterday and Clarence Chamberlin , who flew to Germany , pronounced the plane fit . The start will be made as soon as reports show good weather prevails along the long route . The take-off probably would have been made at dawn tomorrow , on the second anniversary of the start of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh , but was abandoned because of f g and freezing temperature off Newfoundland . Armeno Lotti Jr. , backer of the flight , and his co-pilots , Jean Assollant and Rene Lefevre , had planned to leave on the anniversary . Yesterday Mr. Lotti indicated that the earliest getaway he could hope for would be at dawn on Tuesday . The fliers expect a weather report covering the entire course at noon today . They may base the time of their take-off on the conditions shown by the report , which will be supplied by the government Weather Bureau and by the British Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tryout of the 600-horsepower Hispano-Suiza motor was made in a flight of an hour and a half during the day , a jaunt which took Assollant and Lefevre in a big circle from Roosevelt Field , L. I. , and fifteen miles out to sea . The pilots reported the engine in perfect shape . The wide-winged Bernard-191 plane was trundled out of the Air Associates hangar at the Long Island field at 10:30 A. M. About 200 gallons of gasoline had been poured into her tanks and with Assollant at the controls the plane went away in a fine take-off . They wheeled in slow circles above the field for about fifteen minutes . Lefevre at the instrument board , in a wicker chair alongside Assollant , put the various instruments of the monoplane through their paces . The folding generator , which will produce the power for the radio of the plane , was given a brief test . The monoplane then swung south over Hempstead and passed over the coast line and out to sea . For a short time Assollant drove the roaring craft directly seaward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big adventure . Then he turned eastward and sped along high over Fire Island , and at Bay Shore took a course on a half circle for the landing field . The fliers had planned to fly over the lower bay and circle the Statue of Liberty , but changed this plan when they got into the air . No attempt was made to get speed out of the monoplane ; which cruises at 130 miles an hour and can be accelerated to 150 miles an hour . Assollant explained that they went as slow as they could -- a mere 100 Miles an hour ? so that Lcfevre 's study of the instruments could be more leisurely . Use Same Kind of Fuel as Lindbergh . The last of the fuel which the plane will take arrived at Roosevelt in the absence of the Bernard-191 . This consisted of twenty drums of extra grade aviation gasoline of the type used by Lindbergh . Fifty gallons of castor oil , favored by European air- men as engine lubricant , was arranged alongside the plane . Today the ordinary gasoline will be drained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refillinhe reservoirs with the finer grade l of gas . mixed with benzol. will be started . Every gallon of the gasoline will be trained twice through chamois and Mr. Lotti will be on hand to superintend this task . He will begin tabulating the weight put aboard . He expects to take off with a load of 12 , - ; 00 pounds  --  a task for a single motored plane . hut one which , he said , had been done often in France . Mr. Lotti visited the field yesterday via the Crescent monoplane of Chamberlin . The famous American pilot called at Lotti 's quarters in the Ritz Tower . Park Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street and motored the French aviator out to the Jersey City Airport . Lotti climbed into Chamberlin 's plane and with the American ace at the controls of the plane flew over New York City . It was Lotti 's first airplane view of the city . They reached Roosevelt Field at 4 P. M. A large crowd was on hand to greet them , and the first members of the usual army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lotti . Assollant and Lefsvre . Chamberlin , eager for a view of the French Plane , hurried away from his own plane while the prop ' eller was still spinning , and climbed into the cabin of the Bernard-191 . Plane Impresses Chamberlin. self . " Not to be outdone . interjected Chamberlin , each of the French pilots , when they took the controls for brief tests , also took their hands from the control . " They are exceptionally fine pilots , " Chamberlin said , " and from their questions I should say that each is well qualified as a navigator . In fact . Chief Officer Stedman of the Leviathan , who crossed with Lefevre , told me that the young Frenchman was one of the best navigators he had ever encountered . " Mr. Lotti said that he had received " very valuable suggestions " from Chamberlin during the inspection of the Bernard-191 . " You get lots of advice on a trip like this , " he said , " but some of it is not valuable . When a man like Mr. Chamberlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has flown the Atlantic and in addition he is one of the most competent airmen in the world . We are very grateful to him for giving us the benefit of his experience . " After Chamberlin had taken off for his return trip to the Jersey City air field , Assollant and Lefevre again went over the instruments aboard , rechecking each device . Then , aided by Raoul Leroy , an expert mechanic , who accompanied them from Paris , they tinkered with the Hispano-Suiza engine until it was too dark to continue . Arrangements to get the latest data on the weather prevailing over their proposed course Were completed during the day by Mr. Lotti . He conferred with engineers of the Radio Marine Corporation , a subsidiary of the Radio Corporation of America . He said that he had been extended full cooperation . Messages were didpatched to the Marconi headquarters in London , requesting that ships which will be at sea during 1.113 coming week hold their radio available for transmitting messages to and from the plane . The Marconi company also was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , together with conditions on this side of the ocean will be reported today to Mr. Lotti . He said that even if conditions for tomorrow were favoring he would defer his start . The staff at the hangar of the Air Associates , Inc. , Relic the fliers a souvenir of their visit yesterday . Combination billfolds and pocketbooks , made of the finest leather and edged with gold , were handed to Lotti and his Pilots . The fliers will go down to the field early today , but will not take their plane up for a flight . The test yesterday , they explained , had demonstrated that the monoplane was in readiness and they will not run the Bernard-191 out again until they are ready to go . Mr. Lotti and his two comrades look Chamberlin over the monoplane from tip to tip . The American flier , who set a distance record when he flew with Charles A. Levine from Roosevelt Field to Germany , expressed himself as tremendously impressed with the equipment of the Bernard-191 and with the quality and variety of the instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks like a fine job , " he remarked to newspaper men . " They seem to have pretty nearly everything and to have planned their trip with care . Given good weather , I do n't see a single reason why they should not drive right through to Paris and with good speed . " They are not going to take an earth inductor compass . I would if I Were starting out , although it Is true that the one I had in the Bellanca Columbia went out on the way over and I had to steer by magnetic compass . However , they knew what they are doing . Later Chamberlin invited Assolant and Lefevre to go up in his Crescent plane . The two young Frenchment  --  lk , are 24 years old and were " twins " in the French Army air sets side ? beamed with delight . They Jumped aboard and Chamberlin whisked them skyward . He pat the plane through its pace for twenty minutes and then landed .
