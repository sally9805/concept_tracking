txt President Coolidge , in a letter made public today , addressed to Frederick J. Libby , Executive Secretary of the National Council for Prevention of War , reproved that organization and others for attacking National Defense Day , Sept. 12 . President Coolidge said the organization had employed the term " Mobilization Day " instead of the designation given to it by the Government , Defense Day , in a way to make it appear as a military gesture . while the opposite was what was intended . He asserted that " it seems unfair that plans for Defense Day should be condemned out of hand , simply through the device of misrepresentation . " " What Is proposed for Sept. 12 is merely a compliance with the purposes of the National Defense law of 1920 , " the President said . " It is not a mobilization , and the people who first attached to it the term ' mobilization day ' and then proceeded to condemn it , have been ' : utterly unfair . Most of them , I am sure have been innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The President expressed sympathy with the movement to minimize the danger of war , but declared he was opposed to leaving the nation impotent and unprotected . until the time came when the possibilities of war had disappeared . Text of the President 's Letter . The President 's letter was as follows : The White House ; July 23 : 1924 . My Dear Mr. Libby : Some days ago I received a letter from yourself , as Executive Secretary of the National ' Council for Prevention of War , informing me that that organization " is preparing for a campaign in behalf of world cooperation for peace , to begin July 26-27 on the tenth anniversary of the outbreak of the great war . It is intended to be a great outpouring of the genuine peace sentiment of America . We believe it to be in harmony with your own purposes as expressed on many occasions . ? ? ? We respectfully ask your endorsement of the demonstration . " ? In reply , by my direction , the secretary to the President wrote to you saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your letter of June 80 , with the assurance of his most hearty sympathy for every practical proposal to minimize the danger of war . As you know , he has repeatedly expressed himself in this tenor , and you may be sure of his continued and most genuine friendliness for every worthy and effective effort along these lines . " As is well known to all persons who have done me the honor to familiarize themselves with my public expression on this subject , I have been unqualifiedly sympathetic with the aim and purpose to make war , so nearly as might be , an impossibility in this world . Doubtless this is a counsel of perfection not to be realized without much earnest effort ; to that effort . when guided along feasible lines , I have repeatedly pledged my assitance . It is now brought to my attention that your organization is profoundly concerned because of the assumption that the plans for a National Defense test on Sept. 12 coxestitute a militaristic gesture . This assumption seems to be based chiefly on a confusion of terms . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been denominated " Mobilization Day . " The Government did not do this . It would be proper to call it " inspection Day . " But it is not a mobilization , and the Government is not responsible for any such designation . As a result some well meaning people have misconstrued its character and purposes , assuming that a nation-wide mobilization of forces and of the civilian and industrial resources available for national defense is to be carried but on that day . This , of course , is far from the truth . The Constitution and the law contemplate the maintenance of a defense establishment , which in time of peace always has been , and is now , in proportion to our national power and ' interests , one of the smallest in the world . I have taken an oath to support the Constitution and to execute the laws of the United States . I could do.this by maintaining a large stand- ing army . I am opposed to any such Plan . I am trying to work out a method by which we can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , and leave our citizens free from that burden by letting them assume their own responsibility for a defensive establishment sufficient to provide for domestic peace and order and national defense . Instead of being a military gesture , this plan is the exact opposite . It is a non-militaristic gesture for the purpose of keeping down to Its lowest possible point the professional miUtary organization of the United Stater . Our country has always relied chiefly for its defense upon the readiness of Re patriotic manhood to take up arms when necessity presented . After the great military effort of the United States in ' the World War our army WO demobilized more rapidly and completely than that of any other warring nation . Not only this , hut the Government of the United States Initiated the Washington Conference for Limitation of Armament which brought about highly important reductions in the naval establishments of the great powers and which souzht , though without results to effect also an agreement for reducti , n of armies . Undiscortazed by the ' ailure in effect a limitation of a:mte. : . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly sines that time declared their wish to bring about a further consideration of this question , with a view to accomplishing a general reduction of armed forces by land . In the face of this record , which is known to all the world , it seems unfair that the plans for Defense Day should be condemned out of hand : " simply through the device of misrepresentation . Our Government is compelled to confront the realities of the world . One of these that international agreement for limitation of armies has not been brought into effect . That being the case , our laws provide a small permanent army and contemplate its expansion to meet emergencies . should they arise . Defense Day is intended to bring to the people a reminder of their relations to , and dependence upon , this skeleton defense establishment , in rase our country be attacked . There can be no doubt that failure to prepsr ? for the possibility of war at a time when that possibility was really imminent resulted In great hardship , unnecessary expense , and the unjustifiable prolongation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state what everybody knows . It is desirable that both the public officials who would be responsible for the national defense . and the people who would have to make the sacrifices to maintain it , should know something of our plans for It . What is proposed for Sept. 12 is merely a compliance with the purnoses of the National Defense law of 3920 . It is not a mobilization and the people who first attached to it the tern , - mobi:Ization day . " and then proceeded to condemn it , have been utterly unfair . Most of them . I am cure , have been Innocent of intent to be unfair , but they have been misled . Profoundly hoping that the outlawing of war from this world may be aecomplished . I am yet unable to detect any Inconsistency in giving my approval to the program of Defense Day . I wish crime might be abolished ; but I would not therefore abolish courts and pollee protection . I wish war might be made impossible , hut I would not leave my country unprotected mea ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure the fullest efficiency to the extremely modest defense force our country maintains . Very truly yours . ALViN COOLIDGE . Mr. Frederick . T. Libby . Executive secretary National Council for Prevention of War . 532 Seventeenth Street Northwest , Washington , D. C. tu campaigk but America 's fundamental policy In world relations . May I. before going further , remove a misapprehension about the term " mobilization day " ? This name was first used publicly in The Army and Navy Register of Jan. 5 , where , under the heading " Prospective Mobilization Day Manoeuvres . " it was announced that the " greatest peace-time military demonstration in the history of the United States " had come one step nearer realization that week " when Secretary of - War Weeks gave favorable consideration to the mobilization day plans on which General Staff officers have been working for months . " The same name for the demonstration was used in a story given to Junius B. Wood by the War Department 's publicity bureau over three months later and published in a copyrighted article in The Chicago News of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration In preparation and preparedness is set for Sept. ** Day , as it is to be called . " The name , therefore , if undesirable , was at least given to the day by its , friends . The opposition to this demonstration goes , however , far deeper than a name . First , it is opposition to the theory that is implicit in the demonstration as to the way of achieving national security . Multitudes of your fellowcountrymen believe that agars are no longer victories for any nation and that consequently our only security lies in preventing war itself ; that as a measure for prevention of war , increasing a nation 's military precautions tends only to precipitate the calamity it would avert , and the only hope lies in cooperation with the other nations for the organization of the machinery of peace . Secondly , it is opposition to what Is termed the " bad psychology " of holding such , a demonstration this year . If England or Japan . France or Italy were to announce such a " test " of Its military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded everywhere Rs bringing the world nearer another war . It is felt that a very different kind of demonstration is demanded of America  --  a continuous anti unkrokcn d monstration of America 's will to peace . Opposed as an Innovation . In the third place , this " defense test " Is being opposed because it is recognized as as radical innovation in our national policy which has not been thoroughly , considered by our people . The question is not that of Maintaining our miliStary status quo . The question is whether we shall without debate , in interpreting the very general provisions-of the National Defense act of 1020 , reverse our traditional policy without regard to the influence of such a. change upon our relations abroad . At a time when- the great body of American public opinion undoubtedly favors bur adherence to the World Court , it is felt that our War Department is , in effect , asking us to neutralize at its bidding - the beneficial results of this prospective step toward world peace by taking a very serious step in the opposite direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militarizing tendency of this demonstration and particularly its influence upon our youth . It is calculated to stir our nation 's war spirit and , as it would seem , quite unnecessarily . Our Secretary of State said recently : " So far as we can see into the ftityre , we are safe from the slightest danger of aggression . We know that in no power or possible combination of powers lies any menace to our security . There Is no occasion to vindicate our proper authority , for no one challenges it . There le no reason to demonstrate our ability to take care of ourselves , for no one doubts it . " Now it happens that the very first announcement of a State program for the " national defense test " that I have seen  --  that of the State of Maryland  --  begins : " An enemy is coming . ? - ? ? Within twelve hours after they get the signal to take the air , their armies can blanket the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida like swarms of locusts . ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men must spring to arms by millions . They must drive the enemy out in man-toman combat . ? ? ? They , with the organized branches of the ' one big army ' will be asked to join in the big gesterz that means , ' America le ready . ( From news article In The Halt more Sun . July 15. 1024.1 Your letter states that the " nations I defer , .. lest " is intoortt , to br ? a " nonintlitarh-tie " gesture . The Maryland ronitniltee must have ni Isunderatood its purpose . Such aropagancia as this Is the exact antithesis of what we all deem desirable for the youth of other countries  --  of Germany , for example . Fifth  --  The protest is directed against the restricted idea of patriotism that is being officially promulgated by the War Department in relation- to this demonstration . " Every patriotic cit- ? izen , " General Pershing said at West Point , and has said in substance also in official releases to the press , " will be expected to participate . " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are ready to mobilize for peace . , They stand behind you in your advocacy of the World Court . They will support you enthusiastically in effective cooperation with other nations . They will be a unit behind you - Then you call another disarmament conference to limit scout cruisers , submarines , naval personnel and land and air forces . But they believe that the wise national policy for our country at this juncture is to avoid " national defense tests , " and to express in concrete and practical forms of cooperation a spirit of audacious friendliness . They , too , count themselves patriots . Sincerely yours , FREDERICK J. LIBBY , Executive Secretary . Hon , Calvin Coolidge , President of the United States , the ' White House , Wa.shington , D. C. OBSERVE NO MORE WAR DAY . Women 's Peace Society Holds Meetings and Sends Out a Float .

The picture presented on the float , which was decorated with large trees . was modeled from the famoes picture by Benjamin West , showing the lndiaw ; and the Quakers mingling ; 77 peace . Two large banners , saying " No More War " and " Write to Your Congressman to Make War Illegal , " adorned the float . Mrs. Thomas said the message of peace was brought to about 50,000 people during the day , and that she noticed an Increasing friendliness by the people of New York to the message of no more war .

Handbills were circulated among the crowds telling of Sept. 12 as mobilization day in the army , navy and air service , and urging the movement to mobilize for peace , and recommending that Congress spend the country 's money in providing every child with an education and ' in protecting property and human life by intelligent methods , but not on , armies and navies . ' Another handbill stated that all the nations , including the United States , were now spending more for militarism than they did in 1913 , and perfecting machinery to spread death wholesale . From Wall Street the float went to Battery Park , Union Square and Madison Square , and last evening it held forth in Columbus Circle .

" The demonstration held today is directly in line with the wishes and commands of the Third International , whether the persons holding the no-morewar celebration are connected with the communist party or not . " This is obvious and it may be remarked in this connection that nowhere , in all the propaganda movement for peace , including the present one , has it been permitted to appear once that the Russian Army is the largest in the-world today with something over 710,000 officers and men , that it is largely directed by German officers and furthermore that it is equipped to a great extent by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States has never been and is not now militaristic .
