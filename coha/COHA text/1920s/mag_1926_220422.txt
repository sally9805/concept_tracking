President Erdman . Until three weeks ago Rev. Dr. Charles Rosenbury Erdman of Princeton Theological Seminary was moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly ( succeeded by Dr. William Oxley Thompson , TIME , June 7 ) . Last week he was chosen president of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions . Probably the most heavily endowed agency of its kind . <P> Contempt . If the Chicago Tribune and its noisy offspring , Liberty , had their way , they would persuade ignorant readers that Stephen Decatur 's " . . . our country right or wrong " is the greatest patriotic phrase ever mouthed . But executives of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church of Manhattan last week invited Dr. Minot C. Morgan of Detroit to be their associate pastor ( at $12,000 yearly ) , he who damned that phrase as " a damnable toast of some patriotic Americans . "
