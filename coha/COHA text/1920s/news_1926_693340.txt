txt The gentlemen in Moscow , whose policy toward Dame Britannia seems to be best summarized in the phrase . " How I love the woman : Curse her ! " will not increase their popularity In England or in China if they continue to dwell on their success in China in helping the Cantonese and the socalled Christian beneral PENG to undermine Britain 's commercial and political influence in China . Even British labor is beginning to realize that curtailed trade in China is not good for British factories . The Chinese may begin to ask themselves whether the assistance which the Cantonese have been receiving from Russia is as completely disinterested and high-minded as the Bolshevist agents pretend . Comrade KARAKITAN , the astute Bolshevist Ambassador who was forced to leave Peking last Spring , constantly assured visitors that Russia alone of all the foreign Powers was actuated by utterly unselfish devotion to the Chinese people . Out of Moscow now comes the report that the Soviets believe their general anti-British campaign in Asia is meeting with success . Not only are they highly pleased with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also Idelighted with As anti-British feeling in India , for which they take much credit . In fact , they see the ' Britieh Empire dissolved , and presumably themselves falling heir to its fragments . This cheering prospect is not unlike their prediction a few years ago that the United States would soon be Sovietized . The trouble is In harmonizing these views with their periodically renewed appeals to British capital for extensive loans for Soviet Russia .

Whatever the absurdities of these contradictions , it can not be denied that In China the Russians , for the moment at least , have outplayed the other nations . They picked a horse that has every appearance of being a winner . While encouraging the Chinese to throw off the yoke of " foreign imperialists , " they have been consolidating their influence over the Chinese nationalist groups and are preparing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other foreign nations . They have denounced them for assisting various Chinese war lords , and have tried to hide from the world the fact that of all the foreign nations Russia has interfered most in the internal affairs of China during the last few years . They have undermined British prestige in China and encouraged the Chinese to boycott British trade . In fact , they have capitalized every tendency in China which could advance their I selfish interests ; whereas the British and other foreigners have quarreled among themselves and wavered between weakness and violence . The British Empire , however , persists in enduring . This is a habit it acquired more than a century ago , and which it can not shake off , even though the Russians and others do what they can to help it " reform . " Just when the Russians are gloating with particular satisfaction over the good time that they expect to have at the wake , the patient refuses to die .                   @ @
