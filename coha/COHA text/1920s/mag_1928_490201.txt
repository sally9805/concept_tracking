ALTHOUGH we are an inveterate country gentleman and can be found all through the summer months in fields or along the banks of streams , this is one time in the year when we are deeply moved by the coziness of town life . In the morning the strong rich smell of the reviving radiator fills our office , making us a little sick but quite happy . In the evening , winding our slow way through the gloaming with the lowing- , herds , we leave the crisp street and creep to our firelit quarters , thankful for four walls and no knotholes . In these particular twilights , we do n't know any place in the world we 'd rather not he than in the country , russet and golden and beautiful though we know perfectly well it is . EVERYTHING bothers us . Even checkroom attendants bother us with the decoy twenty-five-cent pieces they display so conspicuously in order to make people think a quarter is the correct tip . Are we a moral coward , or do other people have difficulty introducing a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big shiny quarters ? Sometimes courage comes to us and we proffer the dime , and how quickly it disappears from sight ! We submitted a dime in a theatre checkroom the other night , and the attendant palmed it instantly , and there in its place was a quarter  --  for the benefit of the next customer , poor dupe . UP on Sixty-seventh Street another battle rages over the changing of a house number . Former Governor Miller , his back to the wall of his little town dwelling , lashes out manfully against the big new apartment building on the corner which is trying to steal his address . In all these fights we side with the little fellow , but sometimes we wonder why an address like Number 2 East Sixty-seventh Street means so much in anyone 's heart . Our feeling as of today is that one number is as prosy as another , and that buildings and streets should be named , not numbered . Owners could then wax sentimental about them with some reason . Miller 's **38;250;TOOLONG is an address the former governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixty-seventh Street somehow seems academic . QOMETIMES we get wondering kJ about things until our poor head seems ready to split . Last week it was Mrs. Willcbrandt 's husband . The question came up in our mind : " Where is Mrs. Willebrandt 's husband ? " Well , we did n't know ; yet it was a fair question . It was one of those annoying questions that stick in your head like a familiar tune . " Husband of Mrs. Willebrandt , " we kept murmuring . " Where is husband of Mrs. Willebrandt ? Where is . . . " Then , like a voice from the spirit world , the answer came through to us : " He 's out with Lyle Womack  --  that 's where he is ! " a person who has never once , to his knowledge , obeyed the in-structions in taxicabs to keep a record of the driver , we are not in a position to snake comments . It seems , though , that the photograph by whiah you are supposed to identify the driver is all wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his driver is the back of his head , with occasionally a little ear and cheek . LIrhy should n't the photograph he taken from the back instead of the front ? We have talked to many people about this matter . To a man they confess never having seen a taxi-driver 's face but can recall hundreds of backs-of-necks . G. H. Q. DUTY , and a candid friend who knows all about politics , took us to the various political headquarters . The Hoover offices , we were told , mark a new era in Republican campaigning . The furniture is cheap ; the partitions are made of unpainted hoards ; nowhere is there a trace of elegance . Thus do the Republicans illustrate that they are plain , blunt fellows , and thus are they able to point to what they call the unwonted elegance of the Democratic headquarters in Park Avenue . The Smith people have carpets and such . Hoover 's national headquarters oc ? ? ? ? 111111.1113 18 OCTODER G 19 2 8 cupy several floors high in the Salmon Tower . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their simple being . Two of the floors are given over to Bureaus and Services , including , for instance , a lantern-slide department . We were attracted by a model of a farm which occupied a table . It was of an ordinary farm , about six feet by four in size , and bore the important placard , " Hoover and the Farm . " Since Hoover was not in sight , we made inquiry . We were told that some man out west  --  evidently the kind of person who sends turkeys to the White House at Thanksgiving time  --  had made the model and shipped it in , together with the sign . They set up the outfit , although nobody had been able to figure out what the donor was driving at . We saw a man who probably was thinking the thing out , sitting quietly at a desk . THE headquarters of the Hoover state organization in Forty-first Street are even rougher-looking . The brick walls show through the plaster in two places . Nothing here equals the national committee 's farm , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest ladies come in and offer to Do Something , wan salesmen appear with little things to sell  --  ashtrays with elephants on them , collapsible drinking cups bearing the likeness of Hoover , all sorts of bibelots . They say this is the biggest gadget and gewgaw campaign since Harrison and Tyler . Campaign songs are offered in greatest abundance . An excited composer phoned the offices at nine one night ( they are open till after midnight ) and wanted to sing his song over the wire . Someone had to listen . People with mottoes and slogans arc next in number to songwriters . One man offered to sell for thirty-five dollars the line , " H , the beginning of Hoover and the end of Smith . " Some phrase-coiners send their slogans along by wire . From Maine a genius telegraphed this one : " Beat Smith with Might and Maine . " It was filed under " B. " The handling of candidates ' photographs is important . The pictures have to be just right . Nearly all of those used are somehow touched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line added . One of Senator Curtis looked so much like J. P. Morgan that it had to be thrown out . All this comes under the head of political strategy , and means votes . Doubling for the Talkies AMONG the recent feature films was one equipped with a " sound sequence " which included a sentimental ballad for use in the scenes amourauses . Before the open- , , ing it was discovered that the sound mechanism had gone wrong in this part of the film and that it would be several weeks before the sequence could be used . To meet the emergency , the singer who had recorded the air for the machine was engaged to appear daily in the theatre and sing the ballad behind the scenes . This probably is the first instance of a singer doubling for a sound sequence . Incidentally , different singers doubled for the sequence during the course of the run but the public did not know that it was listening to the actual artist , not a talkie . Roof With a View PERHAPS you ca n't see quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Woolworth Building , because it is not quite so high , but it is more central and you get a better idea of the city . You can see forty-five miles on a clear day , but the day we went up it was n't clear enough for that . It rarely is , we gathered , what with the smoke . We could , however , see a long way . Downtown , past the massed towers of the financial district , Broadway made a gate in which , across a strip of water , rose the low hulk of Ellis Island . A day liner was going up the Hudson , and on the East River three slim white yachts stood at their moorings off the New York Yacht Club landing . The two rivers looked like a bend of the same stream . At our feet was a cigar-box , the Commodore Hotel . On the northwest a scaffolding protected the unfinished tower of the Grand Central Building , with little workmen clinging to the sticks . The angle of vision took the arch out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was framed against a Sunshine Biscuit factory and a blurred patchwork of little houses  --  Long Island City . The Chanin Building is fifty-six stories high . Sightseers on the roof ( they may also visit the theatre for industrial exhibits to be on the fifty-second floor ) will he six hundred and eighty feet above the offices of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on the first and second floors . Our guide told us these things as we leaned against the flagpole . An electrician had just climbed the pole to put some light-bulbs in the globe on top of it . He said there was nothing to a flagpole job if there was no wind . Last . summer , though , he had been scared . It was when a derrick fell off the setback on the twelfth floor and passed the window beside which he was working lower down . He was afraid to look after it but when he did he saw the derrick lying in Forty-first Street between two Packard cars parked eight feet apart . No one had been hurt . After setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seemed about a yard away , we started down as we had come up one story on a wooden ladder , one on an iron ladder clamped to the side of the parapet , three on an unfinished stairway ; thence , from the fifty-first story , to the street level on an elevator made of packing boxes . The fifty-first was a many-windowed floor with radiators , wires , tiling , pieces of wood scattered about Our guide told us it would be occupied on New Year 's Day . We believed him , for we have heard many stories about the Chanin Brothers , Irwin , thirty-five years old , and Henry , thirty-one , ex-machine gunner  --  how , after the war , they started with a thousand dollars or so and built their way into the city from Bensonhurst , Brooklyn . They have put up many structures  --  office buildings , hotels , theatres . The pile that bears their name is their pride . They spent two years planning and an n g an then , after the foundation was in , put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world 's record for steel construction . The toughest part of the job was tearing down the old Manhattan Warehouse which had occupied the corner of Lexington and Forty-second since 1880 and had walls eight feet thick , designed to resist gunfire in case the Southern states should secede again and shell Ncw York . Imposter NE of the faddists who has been Ns- , going about the streets hatless entered Macy 's book department and was browsing about when a lady asked him where she could buy a vacuum cleaner . With hauteur he told her that he did not know . When he was accosted a second time he realized he was being taken for a floorwalker . This encounter was with a woman who had a sharp complaint about the way the book department was arranged . Getting into the spirit of the thing , the gentleman confided to her that he thought the whole store was badly laid out . His third adventure came on the way out . A buxom woman implored him to help her select a necktie for her husband . " Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a gesture of dismissal which sent the woman bustling indignantly off , probably to complain to Mr. Macy . This report may be helpful in case the management is losing a lot of time trying to find a mad floorwalker . Polo Man W vestment banker who sliced a A VERELL HARRIMAN , the in-shot through the goal posts and won the opening game for the United States polo team , takes his polo very seriously . He is a great stickler for details . This season he decided that mallets made by Salter in London were the only ones he could use , so he telephoned London and had several dozen shipped by a fast boat . During August , when horses from his racing stable were galloping at Saratoga , Harriman stayed on Long Island and played polo , in the hope of getting a berth on the International team  --  always a great ambition with him . Polo , however , has never interfered with his banking business , which comes first . He is slim , inclined to stoop slightly , hardly looks the athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is rated at seven goals . When , shortly before the tournament , it looked ? ? as though the team needed a shaking-up , he willingly dropped out in favor of Sanford , a six-goal man . It was nip and tuck for a day or so , and then suddenly Harriman went back in , on the eve of battle . This friendly rivalry between the two men fur a place on the team was also a struggle between two of the best polo strings in the world . Sanford 's stable is said by experts to be probably the best in existence , Harriman 's not far behind . The latter has spent about $200,000 to build it up . He owns Friarstown , possibly the best polo stallion in the country . For many years Harriman has found time to play in important matches , often with Hitchcock , and the latter 's familiarity with his play had much to do , they say , with his selection , finally , as No. 1 . AMEADOW BROOK game , under any kind of sky , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find anywhere . Between periods people speak in whispers . During action , " Well played , Guest ! " is an acceptable cry of praise , although in the last period , with the score tied , it was quite all right to tell any player to " Sock it ! " Hot dogs in the environs were sold for forty cents . This gives them caste . A Renault , parked on a neighboring hillock , bore the campaign legend : " Oovair for President . " Probably the nicest touch to the polo day was that given by Abercrombie ti Fitch , who placed , in their Madison Avenue window , a little can of hoof salve . Rare Old Stuff OO NE evening the proprietor of a speakeasy , a bottle in one hand , several small glasses in the other , went to a table where sat a group of his favorite guests .

" Real , genuine Scotch , " he said . Interim OSunday night , Fifth Avenue be- V longs to almost anyone . It is a vague and melancholy lane . The clock in the church at Thirty-seventh Street surprises you by striking ten as you pass . You have never heard it before . An old gentleman comes along , with an armful of marigolds . Drawn by an ambling horse , a barouche appears . It has been chartered by two college couples whose drinks have worn off . One of the young men solemnly walks along in the rear instead of riding in the seat with his girl . At Thirty-fourth Street a big double-decker bus rolls ponderously off for Boston , its passengers visible in the lighted windows . " How 's that for a hearse ? " says the traffic cop to a visiting friend . What few pedestrians arc abroad seem uncertain whether to walk further . They yaw unsteadily in the light air . In Mallinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crepe . At Brentano 's a piebald man gazes a long gaze into a window which contains fifty copies of one novel . The Fifth Avenue buses are doing well  --  everybody aloft to take the air , which smells strongly of gas from the bus ahead . A searchlight sweeps the sky over Madison Square . Below Twenty-third Street , life ceases for several blocks . An artist from the Village brisks along , bound north , hatless , swinging a cane , full of art . Two young men in Kelleg , e Kart clothes cruise south in an old sedan , looking for a pick-up . At Eighteenth Street they give the word to two girls . The girls walk on , averting their heads . A tired man in knickers passes , his golf dubs rumbling in the hag . At F-learn 's , an alcoholic person with cauliflower ears points out a gatcleg table to an imaginary companion .

Dropping in a dime turns on the current and the outfit then picks up music from the air for fifteen minutes . Proprietors get a percentage of the receipts from the Automatic Radio Corporation , which distributes the things . The machine has one meritorious feature the coin-operated piano lacks , a handle by which , even though the fifteen minutes have not elapsed , it may be shut off . The Bells ffiFIE chimes in the Metropolitan - 1-  Tower and those recently installed atop the Consolidated Gas Company building in Fourteenth Street , nine blocks away , will not , in case you have been worrying about it , clash discordantly . Ve are so assured by a gentleman connected with the Meneely Bell Company , makers of both sets of bells . The idea is that the two will supplement and enrich each other . It is a matter of tone color . Taking the Metropolitan chimes into account , it was decided to key the Consolidated bells a full note above the others and also make them lighter in weight and tone . Thus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand pounds , corresponds to 13 flat on the piano , while the largest of the Consolidated hells , weight five thousand pounds , is C. The other three bells in each set are similarly spaced . The Metropolitan 's E flat , F , and G hells correspond to the F , G , and A bells of the gas company . This combination would not harmonize on a piano , but with these bells it 's all right because the two sets were cast to have different tone colors and hence practically nothing that might be done would make their simultaneous sounding discordant . We asked why it would not have been simpler to have made the gas company 's bells identical with those of the Metropolitan company , and were told that this would have been simpler but that the gas people wanted to individualize their chime so that people would not say , " There goes the old Metropolitan again . " Both peals will play the Westminster Chime , or Cambridge Quarters as it is also known , composed by Handel . Pardon ANEW YORK man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that country from Germany some few weeks ago . When a dignified customs officer went about opening his baggage , the American asked him to cease . The other raised his brows . " You wear no gloves , monsieur , " challenged the traveller . It seems that there is a terribly old customs rule in France that guards must wear gloves in handling personal effects . Nobody , . - however , had ever been known to insist that this regulation he enforced . There was a scene . The guard besought his colleagues to lend him a pair of gloves . It was a warm day and nobody had gloves . Even the chef de gare , who has everything , did n't have a pair . There was a final excited little conference and then , with a flattering word of admiration for a foreigner who knew his France so well , the guards in a body bowed the gentleman through without examination . Snug WITH Old King Winter still two V V months away , a man named Blue has invented a device At . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last major problem of civilization crumbles before science . Lewis &; Conger have one of these window-closers installed on a window in the mezzanine , and we flew over there like a reindeer the minute we heard about it . A salesman , winking and chuckling to himself , led us to where the little article was concealed . It looked simple . A small alarm clock , painted battleship gray , was connected to a metal strap , screwed to the bottom of the window . ( Thirteen-fifty complete , everybody . ) The salesman cautiously approached . " Now , let 's say you want to get up at seven-thirty , " he said . " Make it ten-thirty , " we pleaded , for we have always loved realism . " All right . Now , when you go to bed you open the window , like this . " He opened the window , like that . " Now you set the clock for ten o'clock , like this . " He set it . " Now you are lying in bed " ( here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and held our breath while the little gray clock ticked out a few solemn seconds . Outside the snow was driving down , in bed all was warm and snug . Tchk ! The clock spoke , our eyes opened , there was an awful moment of waiting , and then , with an easy fluttering sound , the window dropped lightly down like an autumn leaf . It was too much . We rolled over and went back to sleep , right on Lewis &; Conger 's floor . THE Mr. Blue who invented the window-closer , we were told , lives in Pittsburgh , but is here at the moment in the Polyclinic Hospital , with stomach trouble . He is an engineer , about fifty , and has always hated cold floors on his hare feet . He invented machinery used in constructing the Hudson Tubes , before he took up bigger things .
