Rio de Janeiro workmen last week were hanging bunting and raising flags ; an official reception committee was hiring bands , inviting speakers , preparing lands ; the three aviation companies of the city were garnishing their planes-all to welcome home this week Alberto Santos-Dumont , whom all good Brazilians claim invented the first flying machine . <P> Of course , they err . Seor Santos-Dumont was flying dirigibles when Otto Lilienthal in Germany , Percy Pilcher in England , Samuel Pierpont Langley , the Wrights and Octave Chanute in the U. S. were perfecting airplane wings and gliding with them , when the Langley motored plane tried to fly in 1903 and the Wright motor plane actually did fly a couple of months later . Alberto Santos-Dumont did not fly a plane until Nov. 12 , 1906 . <P> His motored plane was a system of double planes , resembling box-kites fastened one to another in the general shape of the letter T. A very light and powerful petrol motor drove two light propellers at high speed . The pilot sat at the juncture of the T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santos-Dumont T-plane flew 220 metres in 21 seconds .
