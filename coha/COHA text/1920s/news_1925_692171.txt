txt Texans expect Mrs. Miriam ( " Ma " ) Ferguson to Put up a strong fight against any attempt to drive her out of the Governor 's chair or discredit her ten-months-old Administration because of the road building scandals . She has at stake not only her own good name as a woman Governor and ' a possible re-election next Fall , but also her husband 's chances to get the next vacant United States Senatorship from Texas . Her husband , former Governor James E. Ferguson , sometimes called " Old Jim , " for whose " vindication " she made a dramatic fight which carried a nationwide human interest appeal , is now called upon to fight for his wife . Those who know the couple say that they are devoted to each other , and that " Jim " will fight just as hard for " Ma " as she did for him . Friends of the Fergusons are said to be advising the Governor to call the special session of the Legislature demanded by the group of legislators who met here on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to fear from any impeachment proceedings , especially if she takes , the initiative in a legislative investigation of the highway situation , rather than let the Speaker of the House convena a special session for " impeachment and investigation " purposes . They point out , as the anti-Ferguson group ' admits , ? that not one cent of the hundreds of thousands wasted by thb State Highway Commission in its dealings . with road contractors has been traced either to Governor Ferguson or her husband . Not All Want Impeachment . If any of the money had been traced to " Jim , " the situation would be different . Texas has a Community . Property law , under which half the money a husband earns after marriage belongs to his wife , and half the wife earns belongs to the husband . If Ferguson had received any money in connection with the award of the contracts in question , Mrs. Ferguson then might be technically liable for sharing in the proceeds , but nobody here contends that such is the case . Not all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon " the Mme. Governor " that the Speaker of the House of Representatives would convene an " impeachment session of the House , if she did not call a special session of the Legislature by Dec. 10 , are in favor of ? bringing impeachment proceedings against Mrs. Ferguson . ' Some of them have been friendly to the Fergusons until now , and were active in suepo of the " Ferguson Amnesty bill , " by which at the last session of the Legislature " Ma " completed " Jim 's " - vindication by restoring to him the right to hold public office again , eight years after the - Legislature removed him as Governor in impeachment proceedings for misuse of public funds . Virtually all who signed the special session petitions , however , demand a " housecleaning . " They would like to have the Governor do it herself , but if she refuses they intend to do it themselves . Seek Laws to Prevent Road ? Graft . The moderates among the anti-Ferguson faction take the toosition that whether any impeachment proceedings should be undertaken against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , must depend upon development during the legislative investigation . Their view was expressed by Speaker Lee Satterwhite of the House of Representatives , who in his interview with THE : NEW Yonic TIMES reporter yesterday said he hoped there would be no impeachment proceedings against the Governor , but that if they became necessary the Legislature would not hesitate to impeach the Governor because she was a woman . Some of the Ferguson opponents in the Legislature would be satisfied to let the Governor serve out her term without molestation , provided she agreed to call a. special session herself and made no opposition to legislation which would make impossible next year or afterward such waste and extravagance in the use of the highway fund as has been disclosed this year . Would Avoid ' Vindication ' Tactips . Another view " which " has been put forth recently is that " Jim " Ferguson should be forced to keep his hands off the affairs of the Executive office . Twitting the former Governor on his statement months ago that after his inaugqration he , would merely hang around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant Governor Lynch Davidson of Houston said the other day , as quoted in The Dallas Morning News : - alagislation should tie enacted inhibitgia-gwood and water carriers from performing the functions of office held by - those of affinity or consanguinity , whether such offices are of , major or minor degree . " ' Still other Texans oppose any attempt ' to impeach " Ma " on an entirely different ground . " After Jim was impeached and driven out of office , " they say , " we had him on our neck for eight years . He appeared before the People at every opportunity , becoming a candidate for Governor , United States Senator , and even foe , President ( on his own ticket , the so-called American Party ) . " Finally , after his name was kept off the ticket in last year 's Gubernatorial race on the ground that his previous Impeachment had disqualified him to hold office , he nominated and elected his wife as Governor . Now if we Impeach her we 'll have the Fergusons on our necks for the next fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ferguson 's Bold on Voters . In this connection , it is pointed out here , Ferguson has a remarkable hold on a huge group of voters , especially farmers , who have cast their ballots for him in large numbers during past years , impeachment or no impeachment . He has an amazing faculty for making friends who believe he can do no wrong and who will stick by him through thick and thin . It seems evident , however , that among ? the anti-Ferguson group are some extremists who have been political enemies of the Fergusons -- especially " Jim " ? for years and who would like to see both of them driven out of politics for- , ever as a result of the present investigation . Like the rest of the " solid South . " of course . Texas is an overwhelmingly Democratic State , and almost all of the political fights are among - the Democrats themselves . There are not enough Republicans to stage a decent row between the two parties . So Ferguson 's most bitter enemies are right within his own party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive " Ma " Ferguson out of office in the same way as " Jim " was ousted , chiefly to " kill off " Ferguson for good . Just how much politics is behind the Present movement is hard to tell . The Ferguson element , of course , has insisted that it is all politics , but this contention failed to convince after the American Road Company last week agreed to a judgment in Attorney Geneneral Dan Moody 's suit against it , whereby It turned back $600,000 excess profits on road contracts to the State , and consented to quit doing business in Texas . The Fergusons have also been quoted as attributing the attack on them to instigation by the Ku Klux Klan , partly out of revenge for the way in. which Mrs. Ferguson defeated the candidate supported by the Klan in the run-off Democratic primary last Fall , and partly out of a desire to spike " Jim " Ferguson 's guns in the race , he has been Preparing to snake to defeat United States Senator Earle Mayfield for reelection . A visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klan is a dead issue here . The anti-Ferguson group , giving " Ma " and ' " Jim " credit for killing the Ilan last Fall , say that the people of Texas are sick of its attempts to dominate the State , and that it has no more political influence here . - Sympathy Mingles With Regret . While opinions differ about " Jim . " there are feelings of chivalrous symPraha for " Ma " in the present crisis . She is widely regarded as an upright , God-fearing , intelligent woman , a goad wife and a good mother . The.fact that she was the agency by which the Klan , met its final crushing blow in Texas will always be remembered to her credit here . Uncles different circumstances , if she* had had the requisite training and preparation in public life and civic affairs , it is believed her natural ability would have enabled her to have made a much better record as Governor . As it is , however , her present dilemz. a is regarded as proof that women are not competent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a State without the same training and experience that a man in public life would have . Mrs. Ferguson was transformed almost overnight from a housewife to a high public official , and the people of Texas are not surprised that she has blundered ' into a mess . i'Jim ! ' and " Ma " in the Executes ? Office . It is so much a matter of common knowledge here that " Ma " Ferguson is Governor in name only , and that " Jim " is the real Governor , that Texans express surprise when questioned about this state of affairs . When lawyers business men , politicians and newspaper reporters have business in the Executive Office nowadays , they ask for Mr- Ferguson and not for Mrs. Fergtvon , or if they hapPen to ask to see the " Governor , " it appears to be understood that they mean t " Jim " and " Ma . " If a representative of the State University , for example , wants to protest against the Governor 's Veto of items in the appropriation bill for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Ferguson apparently has been spending more time in the Executive Office since the predent emergency arose than she did before , but widespread reports have it that formerly she spent very , few hours there . It is said to have been " Jim 's " habit to walk over to the Capitol about 8 o'clock every morning , from the Executive mansion , and to remain at his desk Practically all day long . About 10 o'clock in the morning , it is said , " Ma " would drive over in her automobile and would enter the executive office to receive formal visits from persons who desired to pay their respects tp the Governor , and to sign official documents . Sometimes she would leave for luncheon and not return the rest of the day . papers being sent to the executive mansion for her signature if necessary . Governor and former Governor ? occupying the mime office , " Jim " would not bother " Ma " about technical details of the 14 , irninistration of the State business , according to callers who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission " Throne . " ' " Jim " even represedta the Governor in ugh formal affairs as speech-making and presiding over formal affairs of a Public or semi-public nature , " Ma " is a Door speaker . who reads a , brief mann . script when it is ' absolntely necessary Vie her - to make -- a speech , - as on her inauguration , but " Jim " is a born orator , with a fine stage- presence and the ability to sway crowds . Only the other day , when both houses of the Legislature held an " unofficial " meeting here to oppose Federal inheritance taxes on all property except taxexempt securities , itawfas " Jim " and not " Ma " who went out from the executive office to address the - legislators . One of the early criticisms of the Ferguson Admingiration , even before the formal charges of waste and ex ' travaganee were made in court , was that " Jim " sat with the members of the State Highway Commission when they awarded contracts . He had no official connection with the Commission ' any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his appearance at the Commission meetings ' was explained by the statement that he was representing the Governor to see that the interests of the people- were protected . . Those who are pressing the attack against the Ferguson Administration now charge that Ferguson " sat on the throne " in the Highway Commission " just as he sat on the throne in the Executive Chamber . " Charging that he attended every meeting of the Highway Commission until last month , Ferguson 's opponents are trying to hold him responsible for the conduct of the Commission 's affairs . Ferguson is being attacked with particular severity because , after Attorney General Moody filed suit against the American Road Corapany , " Ma " Ferguson , as Governor , wrote to the Highway Commission urging It to resist the suit , although she had been urged to investigate and hold the Highway Commission responsible for incompetency and waste . " Jim 's " opponents charge that Ferguson dictated his wife 's course in this action just as he had dictated previous actions by the Highway Commission , and that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to interfere with the investigation . It is even charged that two lawyers were paid $1,000 each out of public funds to help resist the Attorney General 's suit . Daughter Bonded Road Contractors . The name of Mrs. Guido Nsulle , daughter of the Ferguson . has been brought into the case in criticism of the road contracting situation . She has beep engaged in an insurance business , - writing surety bonds for road contracting companies which obtained contracts from the State . The Houston Chronicle commented as follows the other day on this aspect of the case : " We regretted that Mk daughter was in a business that permitted her to write surety bonds for road contracting companies . She is a sweet , sensible , refined woman and the soul of honor . We realized that she had a legal right to solicit surety bonds wherever she ' wished and that her business was legitimate . The indirect connection with the State 's business looked bad , but it - was not necessarily wrong . " It is regarded as curious here that although Ferguson 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road Company was not required to give any bond at all for the performance of the work it undertook , although its assets were less than a:50,000 and its contract was for $1,700,000 worth of road Iwo* . Would Widen Scope of Inquiry . Ferguson had also been criticized Prior to the recent explosion because of his conduct of Ferguson 's Forum , a weekly newspaper published in TerriPle . Texas , his home town . It was regarded as unethical by some of the people that he should publish advertisements of road contractors who night expect contracts , from the Highway Commission . He dos also criticized for accepting the position of attorney for the Sugar Land Railway . Although all the charges so far made in court against the Administration deal with the acts of the Highway Commission , it was learned today that the legislators who held a caucus here Monday night and decided on a. special session agreed that there should be an investigation of other State departments as well . The Prison Department is understood to be subject to investigation . There has been a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of pardons , paroles , and other relief granted by the woman Governor . She issued 105 clemency proclamations to prisoners today in honor of Thanksgiving , including eight women . The prisoners pardoned today/had been sentenced for such offenses as theft . burglary , manslaughter , second degree murder , forgery , pandering , criminal assault , robbery with violence and violation of the liquor laws . Many werfi liquor eases . - In the ten months she has beea Governor , Mrs. Ferguson has issued 1,126 clemency proclamations , a record for the same period of time for any Governor of Texas . The list included 209 full pardons , 460 conditional pardons , 67 paroles , 131 restorations of citizenship , 188 furloughs and extensions , 18 revocations of furloughs and paroles , 22 remissions of jail sentences and fines , 22 remissions of bond forfeitures , 7 commutations of death sentences to life imprisonment and i reprieves , Criticism of the Governor irk this respect , as in others . is also directed against her husband .
