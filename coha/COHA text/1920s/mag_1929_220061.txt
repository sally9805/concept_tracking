Charles Curtis of Kansas likes to have a discreet and well-trained young woman as his administrative assistant , so last week he appointed Miss Lola M. Williams of Kansas , long his senatorial secretary , to be the first woman to enjoy the majestic title of " Secretary to the President of the United States Senate . " <P> Speaker Nicholas Longworth of the House has long had a woman secretary , able and personable Miss Mildred E. Reeves of the District of Columbia . Her bobbed hair , olive complexion and wine-colored dresses are familiar decorations of the House , where she can generally be seen in a rear seat on the Democratic side watching legislation hawk-eyed . With women in its membership , the House is used to having women on its floor ; hence it admitted women secretaries long ago . But not the Senate , where men are statesmen . Women members of the House may tread there . And " grand old " Mrs. Rebecca Ratimer Felton of Georgia , was actually Senator , for one day in 1922 , by a southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more rigorously than senators-suspect . <P> Now Senators will see , tripping politely up to their august rostrum , a slim person in her early 30 's , with bright blond hair and a ready smile . Lola Williams got on in the world by cultivating a small potato patch of her own in a corner of the family farm ; later by selling newspaper subscriptions . She reached Washington in 1918 , a trained secretary looking for a job . The War Department took her in as a clerk until Senator Curtis found her . Now she is queen Secretary of the whole vast capitol . <P> Another Congressional secretary received a substantial promotion last week , when Representative Fiorello* H. La Guardia of Manhattan took Miss Marie M. Fisher , his secretary for 14 years , unto him as second wife . Congressman O. J. Kvale of Minnesota , a Lutheran minister , performed the service and the marriage was formally announced on the House floor . Two days later Representative La Guardia , swart and peppery , impeached a Federal judge . <P> <P> *Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Felton , now 94 , was flung against the back window of the car when it crashed another . She , the only one hurt , sat calmly while physicians worked on her face for two hours , staunching her wounds and putting in 20 stitches . * " Little Flower " in Italian .
