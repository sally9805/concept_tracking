The Week ONLY one thing can be said with assurance . about the President 's nomination of IVIr. fierce Butler as an Associate Justice : Quite enough lsknown , or at least , has been made known , to for b - , 1d hasty confirmation . His paper record tells Tittle . That he styles himself a " Democrat " means 11 ? thing ? That label ? no less than " Republican " is a veritable Joseph 's coat . Mr. Justice McReyn- ? ls is a " Democrat " ? and also the most hard- bailed member of the Supreme Court , That Mr. e'll.itler was counsel for the government in a pack- fla ' prosecution is , in itself , as irrelevant ground ? 1 Confirmation as the fact that latterly he has h linedeleted J vvilson 's C 13. et as a " trustbuster , " while ex- ust ' a 41 n Justice Clark was not blinded by his railroad coniecti0ns . It is essential to go beneath these sure layers to the core of Mr. Butler 's outlook on the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 1 . The vital significance of that Court is as 11 , einterpreter of the Constitution ? the arbiter of ? .4.1 and states ' power . But " constitutional law " is not a quantity of determinate knowledge . It ' rests , fundamentally , upon the attitude of mind of the Justices . Lincoln saw this clearly when he came to select a Chief Justice ; and it behooves the Senate to search the qualifications of Mr. Butler for shaping the destinies of this country as thor- oughly and as publicly as it examines any other executive proposal . The complexion of the person ? nel of the Supreme Court may affect the future of this country much more deeply than a ship subsidy or a bonus or a tariff . ONE of the elementary qualifications of a Justice of the Supreme Court is a judicial temper . No one would have thought of Jude Landis for such a position , even if he had been a monument of legal learning , because of his failure in this essential attribute . Does the record of Pierce Butler give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years Mr. Butler has been the most promi ? nent member of the Board of Regents of the Uni ? versity of Minnesota . He more than any other man is responsible for the reactionary tactics of that body . But the matter now of moment is that in his dealing with members of the staff of the Uni ? versity , who were brought before the Board for trial and sentence he exhibited the judicial attitude of Judge Jeffries . The case of Professor Schaper , for many years head of the Department of Polit ? ical Science , is one in point . He was called to ap ? pear before the BOard without notice , charged with disloyalty , put through a verbal third degree large ? ly conducted by Butler , denied written charges and opportunity for reply , and summarily dismissed on the same day . The teachers and alumni of the University of Minnesota should be heard on Pierce Butler 's record and personality . WHAT is President Harding going to do about it ? Is he going to stick to the old ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can carry to a more seaworthy bottom ? At present it appears that he prefers the former course . His effort to put the subsidy through and his nomination of Butler for the Supreme Court are the acts of a gallant gentleman making his will . They are cal ? culated to widen the breach between the progres ? sives and the conservatives in the party and , more ? over , are bound to increase the progressive strength . But too much may be inferred from these two instances of die-hard policy . President Harding is distinguished among men for the tardi ? ness of his reactions . He is the kind of man who does not turn until he is well past the turning of the road . It is still possible that he may come to see that his only chance of holding the party together is to transship . The sacrifice he would have to make would be appalling . Fall would have to be abandoned with the derelict ; so also Daugh ? erty , Weeks , Davis and Mellon . The President would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his present policy , postponing every meas ? ure that has any political bearing to a special ses ? sion of the new Congress convened after March 4th . It is not impossible that he may do this . But we can conceive of few things more improbable . SENATOR LADD has done valuable work for the progressive cause , and may be expected to do still more valuable work , , if only he can restrain himself from running off after the false gods of fiat money . He attacks the various plans now be ? ing put forward for the improvement of rural credit conditions on the ground that they are more pleasing to the bankers than to the farmers . What the farmers need , he says , is not credit , which will plunge them deeper into debt , but real money . If he means by that better prices for their products , we have no quarrel with him . We have one if he means non-interest bearing paper based on im ? perishable farm products and circulating as money . Such paper would no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoist other prices still higher . The farmers may enjoy a semblance of prosperity in a period of inflation , as they did in 192o . But the persons who win real prosperity in such a period are not the farmers , who have to devote their time to their fields and live stock , but the speculators who have nothing else to do than to . apply their wits to extracting the maximum advan ? tage from price changes . SENATOR - ELECT HOWELL is another progressive leader who owes it to the cause to re ? consider certain of his hasty prescriptions for economic ills . He wants the government to take over , not all the railways , but a single system , to regulate the rest through its competition . But our railway problem is not today one of monopoly . charges and excessive earnings . The real problem is waste ? waste due primarily to past competition . The biggest factor in waste is the excessive dupli ? cation of terminal facilities . Accordingly the government ought to take over all the roads in some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nationalization . In that way it could institute terminal reforms that would make lower , rates practicable . No important economies could be effected through the operation of one competing road among many . Of course , the government might cut rates on such a road , making up its defi ? cits out of general revenues , and thus drive other roads into bankruptcy . That , however , would be confiscation in fact , if not in law . We suspec ' that before it had gone very far the Supreme Court would proclaim the true character of this device . EUROPEAN diplomats make very wry faces over the American communication denouncing se ? cret treaties and arrangements " such for examPle as the tri-partite agreement of 1920 , " as conflict . ing with the principle , Of the open door . America , our diplomatic critics declare , is fertile in advice ' but barren in performance . We have views as to what should be done in the Near East , but refuse to assume any responsibilities . The criticism i9 not very well taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of . , responsibility for the open door policy when it enabled the Allies to win the war . It was no part of the American program to substitute Allied imperialism for Ger ' man . But that is exactly what the Allies proceeded to do . They undertook to carve up Turkey with not the slightest concern for the interests of civil ' ization , but each with a jealous eye to its DO material interests . That policy wrought endless mischief . It divided the Allies and gave the Turk license to do as he pleased . It has always worked that way and always will . America is irrevocably opposed to such a policy , which endangers her se ' curity as well as that of the rest of the world . M. CLEMENCEAU 'S attempt to bring about political and military cooperation between France and the United States will not be assisted by tW ? recent revelations of the tendency of French o6 ' cial opinion . One is the attitude of hostility which the Foreign Affairs Committee , of the Chamber of Deputies has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference . The treat may be ratified in spite of this hostility , but it Well certainly make Americans as well as Englishnleti uncomfortable to learn that the Committee on For ; eign Affairs of the Chamber of Deputies object to the proscription of the submarine as a commerce destroyer . That is a question about which , if sire remember right , the United States once went to War . Equally disturbing is the advice which M. Dariac , a commissioner whom M. Poincare recent ? ly sent into the Rhineland , submitted to his chief as the result of his investigation . He advises the permanent occupation of the Ruhr Basin in or ? der to insure the complete future domination in the Interest of France of the German metallurgical industry . The report was published in the New York World of November 27th . In the same is ? sue there appeared an article by M. Clemenceau in Which he condemned the base economic material ? ism of such critics of France as John Maynard Keynes . What can you do with such people ? Present prohibition enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , President Harding and his Cabinet agreed today . New York Tribune . The President and his Cabinet were deeply concerned over a belief that the moral fibre of the American people Was deteriorating through the open disrespect shown for the effort to enforce prohibition . New York Times . THE President need not have looked beyond his awn Cabinet table for reason to justify his anxiety . He might have asked Andrew J. Mellon , Secretary of the Treasury , why he ignored a communication from the New York Grand Jury , and permitted Ralph C. Day , Prohibition Director of New York , to resign , instead of indicting him . He might have asked the same official if he proposed to call to account Roy A. Haynes , Prohibition Enforce ? tnent Inspector , for issuing a statement in regard to the New York office which convicts him of false ? hood or incompetence . He might have asked Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty in regard to officials of his department whose theft of seized liquor was called to his attention by the Washing ? ton Grand Jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Volstead Act can not be given ' nen Measure of enforcement as to justify it , with ? ? tit a wholly impracticable diversion of the powers of the federal government . But it believes that the evil of corruption of the government through con ? nivance with law-breaking can be abated , and that the efforts of good citizens should be directed to this end . The place to begin is at the top . Once more we direct the attention of the sponsors for the Volstead Act to their unprofitable servants , Mellon and Daugherty . WE are glad to give credit to Mr. Daugherty Whenever it is due . We congratulate him upon the Bill of Complaint filed by the United States of , . In'lerica against the Chemical Foundation in the District Court of Delaware . It establishes a rec- ? 1. c1 of malfeasance in office of Francis P. Garvan , former Alien Property Custodian , under his own hand . We note with satisfaction the institution of suit to recover $21,500,000 alleged to have been fraudulently obtained . from the government in the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Com ? pany , the George A. Fuller Company , and others . But Mr. Daugherty should look nearer home . Across the Cabinet table sits a hard-faced man who did well in the war , from whom he might inquire concerning his participation in the profits of the Bosch-Magneto transfer , and his interest in with ? drawing the case against the Wright-Martin Air ? craft Corporation . It is John W. Weeks , Secre ? tary of War . THE Ku Klux Klan may well prove to be the most sinister and dangerous social development which has taken place in this country since the war . It combines violence with secrecy , compulsion with moral cowardice , racial hatreds and prejudice with religious bigotry , and the consciousness of social respectability on the part of its individual members with the methods and irresponsibility of outcasts . If it continues to grow in strength , it will become the kind of menace which only a widespread moral and social revival among the American people can neutralize . Yet dangerous as it is , the danger will only be emphasized if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mayor Hylan of New York proposes with so much right ? eous bravado . There is a passage in the letter which he wrote to Commissioner Enright which de ? serves to become classic in the literature of official violence . He orders his subordinate to " drive them out of our city as rapidly as you discover them " ; as if it was the business of the Police De ? partment to " drive out " citizens whom the mayor considers to be a menace . No wonder that the Civil Liberties Union felt called upon to protest . THE execution of Erskine Childers , like that of the four Republican soldiers which preceded his death and made it a logical necessity , is a terrible error . It is one of those irreparable acts which enter into the memory and blood of a people and survive for generations . The only future for Ire ? land is in unity and peace . That was the only hopeful future for the United States after the Civil War . Where would be that future now if the government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jefferson Davis , Alexan ? der H. Stephens and Robert E. Lee ? We do not press the analogy between these cases except in one particular ? the opportunity for political wis ? dom . We have held that the chid responsibility THE NEW for the unhappy state of Ireland falls upon the Republicans , who after the acceptance of the method of negotiation with England , broke the united front which alone could render that method successful . We admit the perplexity and exaspera ? tion of the Free State-government . Above all we regret the assassination of Michael Collins whose spirit and counsel were never more needed than at present . His death was in the deepest sense a fatality , of which the execution of Childers is one of the recurrent reminders . RICARDO FLORES MAGON , a Mexican anarchist , was arrested in 1918 because of an editorial he had written in a Los Angeles Spanish newspaper predicting that the war would result in world wide revolution , which , he said , ought to be accomplished with as little violence as possible . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine ? the severest sentence handed down under the Espionage Act . While in Fort Leavenworth he became almost totally blind , and was suffering from tuberculosis and diabetes . His friends , pointing , to the release from prison of Charles W. Morse and Francis H. Noble be ? cause of ill-health , asked that he be let out . At ? torney General Daugherty , whose connection with the release of Morse is too well known for his comfort , and who allowed Debs to go free without forcing him to " repent , " refused their pleas on the ground that Magon showed no sign of repentance , and that he was n't really sick at all . For months the federal government refused to allow any out ? side physician to examine Magon . Why should this be necessary ? There was nothing the matter with him . This statement has now been refuted in the only possible way . Magon died in Leaven ? worth on November 2 oth . The Great Liberal Victory ! W E have had a bad quarter of a hour with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judgment , and he has the merit , inestimable in our eyes , of i viewing and valuing political issues much as we do . But he quarrels with our journalistic methods . That bothers us , as our readers would understand , if we were free to give his name . It is the name of an extremely accomplished and successful journal ? ist , who knows the public well and understands what it needs . For the text of his strictures , he takes our hand ? ling of the recent election . Do we not agree , he asks , that the case of liberalism in America stands better than it did before the election ? We do . Do // we not rejoice in the fact ? We do . po we not recognize that in Politics , even more than else ? where , nothing succeeds like success , and that a feeling among liberals that they have won a pre ? liminary victory would immensely fortify their souls for the next struggle ? We do . Then , why in heaven 's name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , claiming the election as a great liberal victory , instead of laying emphasis upon the factors of vague discontent and off-year oscillation ? Our critic recognizes these fac ? tors as well as we do . But what good liberal interest , he inquires , is subserved by dwelling on them ? A liberal journal must , he says , perform for the rank and file of liberals the same kind of service that the official communique performs for a na ? tion at war . Above all , it must build up morale . Consider what a job fell to the lot of the com ? munique writers after the terrible collapse of the Italian front . They knew that we all felt much like frightened babes alone in the dark . They knew that nothing would reassure us but milk -- chalk milk if no other kind was to be had ? and they were too loyal to disappoint us so long as the chalk supply held out. , And so they wrote like this : " On the Isonzo our lines were withdrawn to stronger positions in the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitate occupa ? tion of the abandoned terrain . " That is how we should have handled even 3 defeat , says our critic . But the last election was certainly not a defeat for the liberals . Pinchot , Brookhart , Howell , Shipstead , Frazier ? are not these names alone sufficient to distinguish a vie ? tory ? Add the defeat of the Industrial Court in Kansas , of Newberryism in Michigan , of Frel ? inghuysen in New Jersey and of Millerism in New York ; add the liberal gains in Montana and Col ? orado ; add a host of other gains in the congres ? sional and state elections . Does not the sail amount to what may justly be called an imposing victory for liberalism ? Where now is the mag ' nificent machine of the reaction created by the 1926 election ? All knocked topsy-turvy on the inside . It wo n't run at all , after March 4th . No major mischief can be done by it in the next two years . Nothing else can be done either , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ful for nothing . Results , says our critic , are what matter in journalism and in life , and the results of the late election were a victory for liberalism . But the New Republic failed to present cheerful results at their face value . Instead it drew attention to the less cheerful facts behind the results ? as if
