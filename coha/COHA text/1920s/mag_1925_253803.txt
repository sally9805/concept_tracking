Mr. Bruce Barton used to edit magazines-The Home Herald , The Housekeeper , Every Week ; he was at one time sales manager of a magazine-Collier 's . He constantly writes articles <P> for magazines-Tin-American , Collier 's , The Woman 's Home Companion <P> ( TIME , Dec. 1 ) ; constantly writes advertising copy for magazines-the <P> magazines patronized by Barton , Durstine &; Osborn , a distinguished Manhattan advertising agency of which Mr. Barton is President . <P> Despite the fact , that Mr. Barton is <P> so friendly disposed toward magazines , <P> he has no very high opinion of newspapers . <P> Last week , Collier 's published an article at the hand of Mr. Barton : What Difference Does It Make ? Mr. Barton declared that he had " almost quit reading newspapers " and in so doing had added 30 minutes a day to a life which he appears to relish keenly . At one time , he had felt it incumbent upon him , as a well-informed man , to consume one entire newspaper both morning and evening-glutting up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brides , modern Bluebeards , poisoned toadstools , and incendiary spinsters together with more important social and political items . Then a flurry of circumstances had caused him to cease buying newspapers ; he had found he got on comfortably without them and his answer to his own question was implied : Not a particle of difference . " Is n't it possible that most of us overdo the newspaper habit ? " And Agent Barton adduced the example of President Roosevelt , who freed his mind of " all the pull and tug of the nonessential " by having his secretaries clip and paste up the essence of each day 's news . <P> <P> Herbert Bayard Swope , dynamic Executive Editor of The New York World , is obviously a man to take exception to such talk . When the editors of Collier 's showed him What Difference Does It Make ? , Editor Swope shouted for a stenographer and dictated It Makes a Lot of Difference . " Perhaps if my friend Bruce Barton were a more consistent reader of newspapers , he would not have committed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because one item in his paper was unimportant , he argues that all items are unimportant . . . Not so long ago some shots were fired at royalty in an insignificant village near the Serbian border . The Bartonized man would have asked ' What difference does it make ? ' He had-and has - his answer . . . Make a mistake some day in a newspaper and see what happens . . . Knowledge is fed from four main springs : <P> " 1 ) What we are told-the traditional . <P> " 2 ) What we are taught in school and what we read in books-the academic . <P> " 3 ) What we do-the empiric . <P> " 4 ) : What we read in the press-the journalistic . " <P> Finally to annihilate Mr. Barton in this friendly argument , Editor Swope closed with the adduction of Thomas Jefferson 's remark that , if it were left to him to decide " whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government , I would not hesitate for a moment to prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
