A plane flew from California to Hawaii last week . Inhabitants of the U. S. took the news calmly . Four planes had done the trick before . Nine men and one woman had died last year trying to do it . <P> In last week 's plane were four men : Capt . Charles F. Kingsford-Smith , commander , organizer ; Capt . Charles T. P. Ulm , copilot ; Capt . Harry W. Lyon , navigator ; James Warner , radio operator . They made the 2,400-mile hop from Oakland Airport , Calif. , to Wheeler Field , Honolulu , in 27 hrs. , 28 min. - having no trouble except that they thought they were going to run out of gasoline . Their plane , called the Southern Cross , is a Fokker monoplane equipped with three Wright Whirlwind motors . <P> Two days after alighting on Hawaiian grass , the four of the Southern Cross planned to do something that no man had ever before attempted : a 3,138-mile flight entirely over water , aiming at a pinhead in the Pacific called Suva in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anticipation ; the municipal council gave orders to cut down trees and remove electric wires in Albert Park , so as to make a landing field for the Southern Cross . <P> They left Honolulu . Their radio worked beautifully . It sent a babble of reports every few minutes , and the world knew that they were fighting clouds , wind and storm for more than 30 hours . They grew haggard . Suva waited . They saw Suva . Then with engines roaring but little louder than the crowd , they landed , their longest overwater flight accomplished , their gasoline almost gone . <P> From Suva , the four fliers planned to hop 1,795 miles to Brisbane , Australia .
