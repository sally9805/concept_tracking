Outside an office building , in Lichtenburg , South Africa , stood a solitary man . He wanted to enter an office but it was closed . Also he wanted to be first to enter , so he dared not leave the door lest someone take his place . So he waited , sleeping by his post at night , and nights were cold last week in Lichtenburg . <P> His fears that someone might try to take his place were not groundless . Other men soon joined him . They too slept in front of the door . <P> <P> Then came more and more men until there were 1,500 . Then the door opened , four days after the first man had arrived , for he , eager , had arrived four days early on purpose . <P> After the men had gone in the office , they ran out , rushed into automobiles , and recklessly sped toward fields near Lichtenburg . <P> Observers remarked that it looked like an old-time diamond rush in automobiles instead of on foot . They were right . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new diamond fields near Lichtenburg , and race on foot for their claims , the government made each contestant obtain a license in the city and then rush to the field . The distance obviously necessitated automobiles.
