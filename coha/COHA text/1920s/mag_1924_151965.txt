The Deutsche Zeitung ( Berlin daily ) exclaimed : " Another of them gone , over whose grave Germany will shed no tears . " The " another " referred to the Rt . Hon. Sir George W. Buchanan , last British Ambassador to the Court of the Romanovs . The Germans charged him with having been the " first to recognize the Provisional Government before the Emperor even had abdicated , " and , by so doing , with having " paved the way for the Bolshevist revolution . " It was also stated that he had kept the wavering Tsar true to the Entente . <P> Then from London up spoke a sound , corporeal Sir George . Stealing a phrase from Mark Twain , he said that reports of his death had been much exaggerated . In answer to the Germans , he replied : <P> " In the first place , the Emperor never wavered in his loyalty to his allies , but remained true to them up to the day of his death . In the second , it was the American Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the Revolution . I only did so nine days after the Emperor 's abdication and after his Majesty had himself , in his last proclamation to his Army , commanded it to render obedience to the orders of the Provisional Government .
