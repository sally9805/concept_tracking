In the midst of the Irish Sea about 60,000 persons live on an island . The island is called Man , the people Manxmen , and their cats , which are without tails , Manx Cats . The history of the Isle of Man is obscure and old . At present it is a British crown dominion , and many of its inhabitants emigrate to the U. S. or elsewhere . Of these emigrs there was a gathering last week in Cleveland , Ohio . Cleveland Manxmen to the number of 600 attended , World Manxmen to the number of 400 , and Manxmen direct from Man to the number of 26 . At the head of these came one Alderman B. Crookall , member of the lower branch of the legislature , <P> The House of Keys , reputed to be the oldest governing body in the world . He bore messages from distinguished Manxmen of whom one was famed Manxman Author Sir Hall Caine . Sir Hall Caine 's message contained this eloquent description of his birthplace : <P> " Just a sweet little green island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its rolling hills and slumbrous glens , full of gorse and heather and fern ; three or four quaint little fishing ports and one larger town devoted to the joyous and rather rollicking life of the visiting industry . " <P> The Manxmen had some purposes other than curiosity for journeying so far from home . Manxman Crookall and his lieutenant , Manxman Richard Cain , wished to induce the government of the U. S. to make a special proviso in its immigration quota for incoming Manxmen . Said A. B. Crookall : " Our young men are anxious to come to this country . We want a quota like the Irish Free State and Scotland . " <P> " In the homeland there is little ... to do except farm and fish , " said Manxman Cain . U. S. Manxmen , headed by Manxman Daniel Teare , did not favor this proposal . Said Manxman Teare : " I am an American as well as a Manxman and if we started making a separate quota for every little community the size of the Isle of Man , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the North American Manx Association was organized , with constitution and officers ; its president was A. B. Crookall . <P> The visiting Manxmen were impressed by the size of the U. S. , though not by its climate nor its political excitements . The latter , Manxman George J. A. Brown declared to be " weird , " while his companions , annoyed by the heat and dust and goings-on of the convention city , recalled with homesick joy that in Man , where each case requires individual legislation , there have been not more than half a dozen divorces ; that there are no snakes or foxes in Man , and that even the insects are not malicious ; that the Manx temperature rarely if ever exceeds 75 degrees . <P> The name of Man does not derive from its limited fauna but from the Latin name Mona . Its people are tall , Celtic , peaceable . In their looks there is none of that impish cruelty which is supposed by many to account for the condition of their cats . One of these last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congress of the Manxmen , in the capacity of mascot.
