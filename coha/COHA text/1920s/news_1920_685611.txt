txt Judge Learned Hand in the U. S. District Court on Wednesday handed down his decision confirming the report of Special Master A. S. Gilbert in the suit of the Consolidated Gas Co. to have the gas rate law of 1916 be declared unconstitutional and also restraining the Public Service Commission , the State of New York and County of New York from attempting to enforce the provisions of the law for five years from the date of entering the decree . Judge Hand also found that the present rate was confiscatory and fixed a tentative rate of $1.20 per 1,000 cubic feet which the company will be permitted to charge for the manufacture and distribution of gas until March 1 , 1921 . All sums over 80 cents per 1,000 cubic feet paid by consumers to the gas company are to be paid to Richard Welling . Esq. , a special master , until a final decree for its distribution may be entered by the United States Supreme Court . The court accepted practically every recommendation made by the special master and in the opinion covering 89 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendants . Judge Hand , in his decision said in part : " The company has put in proof that its property is worth $150,000,000 and urges that sum , but I am not clear that it means to demand 8% on that capitalization . At 8% that would require a net income of $12,000,000 a year and a gross income before Federal taxes of about $13,000,000 which with a loss of $800,000 would be about $14,000,000 on a spread of 20,000,000,000 cubic fee.t . This would mean an advance of 70 cents not 30 cents as resulted from the master 's findings . " I believe that it is reasonably clear that such an advance will under no circumstances be allowed and I think it best to accept the master 's rate base provisionally with the single exception of adding the full amount to the Astoria plant . This makes a base of $77,000,000 and re , quires-an income at 8% which with ; 800,000 loss is $7 , - 600,000 at a spread of 19,000,000,000 cubic feet . This is 40 cents , making the rate $1.20 instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is within the bounds of possibility that the rate may be fixed so nigh since the plaintiff must eventually account with the future rate in any event . I think it fair to protect it against the possibility that it may he so fixed . Any hardship to the public appears to me to be answered by the plaintiff 's inability for any period to escape the jurisdiction of the state authorities . I have provided that if the state does not act before March 1 , 1921 , the plaintiff shall have all the/funds and shall be free to charge what it pleases . " Such inaction on the part of the state would indicate that the state was contented to leave the matter in that form if the decree were affirmed . If so , I should , of course , to longer interfere with the plaintiff in its pursuit of its tights . While that possibility is in fact too remote to be really very practical , nevertheless the decree must provide against all possible contingencies . The decree itself fixed most of the questions which will arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible period beyond March 1 , 1921 , before the appeal is decided . Of course it should not attempt more than to , subject the sums impounded to the mandate of the Supreme Court . That court will have before it all the case and can make such final decree as it chooses . " I conclude therefore that the statutory rate has become unfair and violates the Fourteen amendment while present prices continue . The defendants must be re . strained for the present from enforcing it and such a decree will pass . " The case does not take into consideration a number of subsidiaries of Consolidated Gas , but includes only the parent company , as a manufacturer and distributor of artificial gas , the Astoria Light , Heat S. Power Co. , New Amsterdam Gas Co. , and the Standard Gas Light Co . These companies represent approximately 60% of the gas business of the Consolidated system . The remaining companies have started similar litigations for higher rates , and to date have been successful in their action . The master 's report fixed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas manufactured and sold . Onthis basis , the gas department of The Consolidated Gas Antem has a property value of about $128.000,000 , inasmuch as approximately 32,000,000,000 cubic feet of gas were sold in 1919 . This valuation , of course , does not include any of the electric subsidiaries , such as New ' York Edison and United Electric Light &; Power Co . While the valuation of these properties is a matter of conjecture , their importance as compared with the gas subsidiaries may be gathered from the fact that electric sales fund:di about 55% of the system 's total revenue . The master 's findings that the company is entitled to an 8% return is believed to have been in line with the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the Lincoln ( Neb. ) gas case , in which it was indicated that an 8% return would not be considered excessive at this time . When Consolidated Gas lost its initial fight against the Eighty-Cent Gas Law , in 1906 , the Supreme Court decreed that a 6% return would not be confiscatory . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money .
