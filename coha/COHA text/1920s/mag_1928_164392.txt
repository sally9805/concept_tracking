Like Hoover <P> <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Your elucidation of Hoover and " Hooverism " TIME , March 26 was the clearest thing we have had yet . We recently had a city election in Seattle . A successful business man , unknown in politics , opposed by every newspaper and every political agency in the city , won out by the most sweeping majority in the history of Seattle . Like Hoover , he was a " rotten " talker ; knew nothing about politics , but the people were willing to judge him by his accomplishments and looked with scorn upon the scathing efforts of the political agencies that sought his defeat . . . . <P> As the national election approaches , it might be well for us to don our gas masks and read TIME . And by the way , TIME , within twenty years , Seattle will be the largest city in the United States . Put a check mark after that statement . <P> R. B. HOYT <P> Seattle , Wash . <P> <P> No Dealer <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " The Beaver Man " in March 26 issue , there is , I believe , one startling misstatement . You say , " He is a very , very bad public speaker . " <P> Now I have a more than passing acquaintance , both with public speaking in general and with Hoover 's public speaking in particular , and , although it is true that the Secretary of Commerce is no spellbinder , no dealer in mellifluous mouthing , he is nonetheless a straightforward , direct , matter-of-fact speaker , who never talks unless he has something to say and who , when he has , says it in language that no one can fail to understand . His delivery and voice have both improved in recent years and still leave much to be desired . They are certainly far from being so poor , however , as to justify your superlative " very , very bad . " <P> FRANCIS A. THOMSON <P> Dean , School of Mines <P> University of Idaho <P> Moscow , Idaho <P> <P> Burst <P> <P> Sirs : <P> . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your magazine , and in every issue his name is invariably written with the phrase " . . . who mortally hates and fears the Roman Pope . " Sometimes you do it twice or thrice in a single issue . If I see it again , I 'll scream . No one hates the Roman Pope more than I do , but this constant repetition is getting nerve-wrecking . If you must explain this not wholly unique hobby of Senator Heflin 's , whenever you write his name , for God 's sake sit down and compose fifty or more variations of the phrase " . . . who mortally ( I ca n't bear to write it ) . . . " and then schedule them for successive mentions of Heflin 's name . <P> Now that I 've said what I have , I feel like apologizing for making such a big splash about such a little thing , but I hope to be helpful to TIME , as well as to myself in letting out this criticism before it became so inflated in me that I blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> R.

I am sure the American people believe in fair play . <P> This is what really happened on the Eighteenth of April , in 1775 : <P> THE LONG NIGHT RIDE OF WILLIAM DAWES <P> by John C.
