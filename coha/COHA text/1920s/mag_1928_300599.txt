Clarence Goecke , 12 , raised and owned , until last week , the best steer in the U. S. Clarence called the steer Dick . When Dick was calved ( July 27 , 1927 ) , Clarence paid his father , Fred Goecke of State Centre , Marshall County , Iowa , $55 for the gangling Hereford bull . Thereafter , every day Clarence fed Dick ground corn , cooked barley , oil meal , bran , molasses feed , clover hay . Clarence groomed Dick himself , made Dick 's hair curly with a special comb , helped make him a steer . <P> Dick followed Clarence about . But Clarence would not let Dick follow him to his eighth grade class in a Marshall County rural school . Dick stayed at home and grew big and fat . Poll came out on his flat , white head ; little knobs grew into shiny , short , down-curving horns . <P> Last summer Clarence led Dick to the Marshall County Fair ; Dick won the grand champion steer prize . Then Clarence led Dick to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize . Both prizes brought Clarence $148 cash . Someone offered Clarence $1 a pound for Dick on the hoof . Clarence 's father said sell ; Clarence said no , he wanted to exhibit Dick at the International Live Stock Show at Chicago . And to Chicago last week he led Dick . <P> Cold winds blew Chicago 's packing house stenches over the Union Stock Yard . But the trainloads of farmers , breeders , fitters , butchers , hay &; grain raisers there with their families minded the fetid air not at all . They were in Chicago for their year 's biggest holiday . <P> Hundreds of animals-cattle , swine , sheep , horses-were led into the crowded stockyard amphitheatre . Dick won the junior feeding contest , the prize for the best Hereford yearling , the grand prize for the best yearling , and $800 prize money for Clarence . Clarence was satisfied and wanted to go home to State Centre . But W. L. Blizzard of Stillwater , Okla. , who awarded one of the prizes , told Clarence to enter Dick for the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick before Walter Biggar , who traveled from Dalbeattie , Scotland , to do the judging . Emma Goecke , 17 , his big sister , took Dick to judgment . Clarence was sick to his stomach . If Dick won the grand champion steer prize , that would be Dick 's end . He would be sold at auction ( as is the live stock show 's custom ) , killed and eaten at some rich Christmas carouse . <P> And Dick did win . James Cash Penney , chain store owner and raiser of Guernsey , paid $7 a pound for Dick-$8,050 all told . The highest previous price was $3.60 a pound , two years ago . Mr. Penney intended to ship Dick to Manhattan , exhibit him to the urbanites , then eat him for Christmas dinner . But gourmanderie was not Mr. Penney 's prime reason for buying Dick , nor advertising . He has stores in small towns throughout the country and he wished to encourage boy &; girl stockbreeders , his customers . <P> When Dick was so fatally sold , Clarence was nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , kidnapped . A scared posse found the stripling all a-blubber , trying to warm his back against the outside of a stockyard store . Reporters nagged him . Muttered he : " Dick 's so gentle he would n't hurt anybody . But he knew me best , and every time I went near him he tried to lick my face . . . . "
