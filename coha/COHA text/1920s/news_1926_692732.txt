txt The interest of President Coolidge and the Government in the success of the movement for further reduction and limitation of armaments , begun at Geneva today , was manifested by the course of the State Department in furnishing to newspapers the text of a statement read at the opening session of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference by Hugh S. Gibson , Chairman of the American delegation . This course was taken in order that the American people should be fully acquainted with the attitude of their Government in its participation in an international gathering sponsored by the League of Nations . No direct or definite proposals were submitted by Mr. Gibson in behalf of the United States . His exposition of America 's attitude was not lacking in suggestion , however . This Government , Mr. Gibson made known , sees a prospect for practical accomplishment in regional agreements of neighboring nations for the limitation of land armaments . To attempt to work out a plan for worldwide limitation of armies does not appeal to the United Stakes as a practicable measure . Further reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington conference called by President Harding , is also suggested by the United States . Mutual Good-Will the Keynote . The keynote of President Coolidge 's position as set forth in Mr. Gibson 's remarks is the establishment of mutual good-will among nations . With that accomplished , " substantial progress " toward world tranquillity through armament restrictions will be made , in the President 's confident belief . The American delegation at Geneva is to use its good offices toward the attainment of that end . " It is imperative , as never before , " said Mr. Gibson to the Preparatory Commission today , " to destroy the spectres of suspicion and of distrust which rise from competition in armaments , and thus lay a foundation for lasting peace . No one of us can aco complish this alone , but together we can go far along the road if we approach our task with a single purpose ? with a readiness to understand each other 's problems and patience to seek solutions . We have no right to disappoint our peoples . " The establishment of mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . This Government holds the hope , however , that out of abstract discussion , no matter how long it lasts , may come concrete proposals to be dealt with " in a direct and practical way , " to quote Mr. Gibson 's opening address . The United States Government is not worried or concerned over predictions that the broad scope of the questions to be considered by the chief preparatory committee will take a year for full discussion . Nor is it taking issue with France , Belgium and some other countries over their insistence that " potential " strength of nations should be a basis for determining the limitation of peace-time armies . " Potential " Idea Not Practical . Mr. Gibson made it clear that the United States , while desiring consideration of proposals that afforded prospect for practical results , conceded that " it seems important to consider general abstract principles . " - This Government does not believe that limitation based on " potential " strength affords an outlook for practical results . But it is perfectly willing to have the " potential " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this " potential " strength theory is that a nation capable of developing war industries quickly and to a tremendous degree should not be permitted to maintain a peace=time army as large as another nation which , while it might have equal population , would be handi- capped in the event of war by industrial inability to produce war munitions to the extent that the first mentioned nation would be able to produce them . As far as disclosed in the general terms employed by Mr. Gibson , the view taken by the United States as to Pie prospect of accomplishment by the Preparatory Commission may be accepted as somewhat as follows : 1 . Seek to establish mutual goodwill and understanding and remove distrust and suspicion among nations by the fullest , freest discussion at Geneva , no matter how long it takes or however visionary some of the suggestions advanced may appear to be . 2 . Segregate from this discussion such concrete proposals as appear to afford an opportunity for practical agreement and consider these with a purpose of translating them into black and white for formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People . 3 . Having - voluntarily reduced its army to 118,000 men " or one soldier per thousand inhabitants , " as Mr. Gibson put it at Geneva today , the United States feels that it is not intimately affected by any proposal to apply armament reduction to land forces . At the same time It has a sympathetic understanding of the situation affecting other peoples . " It is fortunate that our situation has permitted this reduction , " said Mr. Gibson , " but we are not disposed to overlook the fact that other countries are differently placed and that their problems are not susceptible of such simple solution . " 4 . In these circumstances constructive achievement in limiting land armaments appears to the United States " to lie in the conclusion of regional agreements rather than in an effort to work out a general plan for limitation applicable to the whole world . " 5 . In an effort to put an end to international competition in armaments a practicable approach toward achieving the purposes of a disarmament conference is afforded . 6 . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished by the Washington conference of 1921-22 . Only big armorclads and aircraft carriers were affected by the agreements to curtail competition in naval armaments . Cruisers ( except as to their size and the maximum calibre of their guns ) , flotilla leaders , destroyers and submarines were not affected . The United States desires to extend the limitation of competitive building beyond capital ships and airplane carriers . President Coolidge today made it plain that he is unalterably opposed to legislation proposing an increase in the personnel of the army , despite the fact that this increase may be deemed necessary to meet the requirements of an increased air service , as proposed in the pending five-year army air pro gram . The President holds that the men needed for the air service should be drafted from other branches of the army . He believes that by following this course the size of the army can be kept down to the size specified originally by Congress and that considerable money can be saved .                @ @ @ @ @
