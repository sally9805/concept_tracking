" TIME brings all things " Faith <P> In Havana , one Angel Arango pleaded and pleaded with air pilots to take him aloft . He wanted to step off the wing of a plane and drop into the Gulf of Mexico from an altitude sufficient to test a combination parachute and buoyant belt he had invented . Pilots old and pilots young refused to budge . To them the device did not look practical . Last week , however , Senor Arango found his man , clambered joyfully into a cockpit , waved goodbye to watching thousands , crept out on the plane 's wing tip at 3,000 feet , stepped backwards into empty air . The parachute clung to his back like a bad dream , unopened . The Gulf of Mexico rolling absently splashed once . Rescuers found no whole bone* in Senor Arango 's corpse . <P> Gossip <P> In Nice , Prefect of Police Andr Gueulechien gazed across his desk , pensively caressing his pointed beard . Towards him from the door , assisted by gendarmes , staggered a woman , gurgling unintelligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentively . He recognized the woman as a Mme. Jaquin , a Belgian lately released from the jail . But he could not understand her . Peering closely , he perceived that her tongue had been cut out , evidently with a sharp knife , close to the root . He frowned . It would be a vexing investigation , for the Jacquin woman could neither read nor write , and her friends were few . Her late jail sentence had been for gossiping viciously about neighbors . <P> Clown <P> In Budapest , Bela Morvay , clown , put mad new touches upon his old familiar act at the Volksgarten Meirkus , convulsed his audience as never before , worked up to a climax where he imitated a man committing suicide by eating white powder from a little paper bag , fell to the ground writhing comically , waved away other clowns who rushed to his assistance , cried , " Let me die ! " and did so , grinning . Dismissed , he had failed to find a new job . <P> <P> * The bones of flyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , usually have to be dug out of the ground from beneath their flesh , through which they , being harder , are driven at the body 's impact with the earth .
