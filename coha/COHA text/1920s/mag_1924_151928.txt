The general contents of a report prepared by a group of experts for the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva were published . The committee consisted of experts from the College of France , the Royal Institute of Florence , the University of Breslau , the Pasteur Institute , and Harvard , Copenhagen , Rome and Columbia Universities . It was appointed to investigate the possibilities of the use of poison gases and of bacteria in future wars . <P> Its report was well calculated to arouse the fears of the closely-packed nations of Europe ; indeed , its portent is grave . It pointed out that in the last war some 30 poison gases were used , gases which caused burns , destroyed the mucous membranes , produced temporary blindness , brought about violent sneezing . <P> But these are a mere bagatelle compared to the new and more efficient gases which are now available . There are more than 1,000 gases which may be used in future wars . Moreover , most of these may be easily manufactured in ordinary chemical factories . So any nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being superlatively armed . The use of airplanes will make possible the spreading of these gases in industrial centres and among the civil population , with a terribly fatal effect . It will be practically impossible to provide protection on a nation-wide scale against some of these gases . <P> There is a painless gas which produces a fatal effect on the heart , of which the victim would have no knowledge before - or after - he dropped dead . There are gases which upset the digestive functions and prevent the taking of food . Other gases poison the blood and prevent it from carrying oxygen to the several parts of the body . Gases may be used which have a gradual effect , not noticed at first , or which-like mustard gas-seep into solid objects and infest a neighborhood for weeks . <P> It would be virtually impossible to equip an entire nation with gas masks , and against certain gases even gas masks would prove ineffectual . Any nation might discover an especially deadly gas and at the outbreak of war deluge its enemies with it , practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Fortunately , there will probably develop various practical obstacles to the execution of any such horrible schemes . Since , in the main , for an attack on civil populations , aeronautical means must be relied on , an adequate aerial defense against airplanes and dirigibles would be an effective countermeasure . The carrying-loads of air vessels and their radius of action are also limited . But among the smaller nations of Europe these limitations are not as important as in a great area such as the U. S. <P> As to the possibility of the use of bacteria , and the waging of a war of disease , this is fortunately less than the possibility of serious gas attacks . Water supplies can usually be fairly well guarded and protective measures taken to prevent the spread of disease , even if these sources are infected . There are filtering , chemical purification and vaccination as countermeasures . Bacteria , likewise , can not be distributed in shells as can gases , because the explosion would destroy them . They would have to dropped in glass tubes by airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of gases , is small .
