Not unto glamorous " Holy Russia " but into the drab , mechanized Soviet Union came last week the first Reigning Sovereign to enter Moscow since the days of Tsar Nicholas the Last . The visiting potentate was His Majesty , King Amanullah of Afghanistan , styled by his Moslem subjects , " The Peace of God . " Accompanied by his Queen , Thuraya , " The Starry One , " he is now completing a tour of the Occident ( TIME , Jan. 23 et seq. ) which has taken him on state visits to Rome , Paris , Berlin , London and several smaller Capitals . Last week the royal party , including Crown Prince Rhamatullah Khan and highest dignitaries of the Afghan State plunged from the Polish border into Russia aboard a new and sumptuous Soviet special train of 14 salon cars . The plunge was momentous because King Amanullah , whose Realm lies between India and Russia ( see Map ) , holds the balance of power in Middle Asia betwixt the British Empire and the Soviet Union . He has just learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer for his friendship . Last week it was Russia 's turn to cap the British bid and to dazzle King Amanullah with a display more imposing than the English pageantry and war games in his honor which have just cost the British Exchequer some 45,000 ( $219,000 ) . <P> Reception . To welcome and impress the Afghan Potentate , when his train chuffed into Moscow last week , there stepped forward a scrubby-bearded one-time peasant , clad in a plain dark overcoat topped by a soft felt hat . This was Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin , beloved President of the Soviet Union. * The effect of his sombre simple garb upon King Amanullah , who for four months has been feted by Presidents in sleek tail coats and Monarchs attired as field marshals , must indeed have been impressive . Darting a quick glance about the station , His Majesty saw not a single silk hat or full dress uniform . Behind the President were grouped several Commissars ( Ministers ) clad as simply as he , and behind them , filling the station square , stood rank upon rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President Kalinin , stepping forward and extending his hand , said briefly in Russian : " In behalf of the Soviet Government I greet your Majesty 's arrival in the Soviet Union . " Then as Queen Thuraya descended from the train , that great and polished linguist Soviet Foreign Minister Georges Tchitcherin advanced and addressed Their Majesties in their own tongue . He said : <P> T u F j o L " , l- ; ul 1 Comrade Tchitcherin words may be translated : " O King and Queen , you are welcome ! "
