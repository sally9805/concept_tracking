Thrice last week , jurists were titillated at the queer workings of French Justice : <P> Rent Free . For five years Mr. &; Mrs. Hadley Beck , U. S. citizens , have lived rent free in Paris , by tying up their houseboat to docks along the Seine . They have even escaped dock rent by moving their boat a few yards every fortnight . <P> But last week French Justice was avenged , when smart Mr. &; Mrs. Beck applied for a Paris divorce . They were told that their mode of life did not constitute a " fixed residence , " and that at least one of them would have to reside ashore for at least six months before they could apply for a French divorce . <P> Female to Guillotine . Not for 41 years has the head of a woman been legally detached in France . Though murderesses have abounded , one and all have successfully pleaded : 1 ) Faithlessness of the murdered man ; 2 ) Insanity ; or 3 ) Beauty . But last week there was sentenced to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither insane nor beautiful , and unbetrayed . <P> With Satanic cunning Junka Kures had strangled a little girl , Carmen Bruniaux , and then so arranged her that the child should appear the victim of a male attack . Righteously and furiously incensed , a male jury and judge condemned Satanic Junka Kures to have her head detached . <P> Apologetic Jury . So many French juries have recently acquitted murderers of both sexes that , last week , the foreman of a Paris murder jury which had acquitted a confessed murderer ( male ) apologized as follows to the Court : <P> " Juries are often embarrassed when they have to render their verdict because they have not a sufficient influence on the choice of the sentence to be passed . . . . We consider that the solution of the difficulty can be found in closer collaboration between Magistrates and juries. "
