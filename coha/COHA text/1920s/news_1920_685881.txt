txt Every citizen of the United States , and particularly every citizen employed in gainful employment , whether a member of a union or not , radical or conservative , should read the account of the condition of Petrograd as reported by unimpassioned doctors and civil engineers from observation on the spot . It is published in the Saturday Evening Post now current . It is a statement of facts , and in no sense a partisan document . If we could take a city of the size of Philadelphia and imagine it with all its sewer connections rotted and broken ; with its sanitary water supply non-existent ; with every toilet : mil similar convenience in private houses , public buildings al0l office buildings alike , completely out of order ; with the cellars of private houses and office buildings converted into cesspools ; with the garbage and refuse of all kinds rotting in the public streets and the backyards ; with wood the only fuel , and that only obtainable by the destruction of frame houses and even of the wooden barges to transport the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though incomplete idea of the condition in Petrograd today as a result of Bolshevist rule . The only remedy which Levine and his dictators can suggest is that the oppressed and dying people of Petrograd shall perform the impossibility of removing this filth themselvo. - . Before the Lenin ? regime , the population of the capital of Russia was upwards of 2,000,000. and it is now one-fourth of that number . Even the Bolshevists confess to at figure below a million . The hospitals arc in a condition as bad as that of the private houses . There is no provision for the commonest decencies . Necessary med. icines are not available . There is one doctor to two hundred patients . and foul diseases of a kind which were thought extinct are rampant . Infectious cases are pot in with the rest . The condition of the sick . in the matter of bedding and baths alone , could not be told outside the eolunns of medical journal . This is applied socialism , worked out to its logical rest:It . ? With capital destroyed , with individual effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administered by the most ignorant of the population , Petrograd is becoming a city of the dead . The only sonilacy method possible now is such a fire as that in London in which burned out the last remnant .. of the great plague . Excuses for the failure of the Lenine experiment may still have some validity in unbalanced minds . The best civilization can do now is to segregate this appalling evil in western Russia , so that the devastating curse may tint spread . Transportation is destroyed . There is no employment but the famine hunt for food . The worst excesses of war have produced no such hell as this . Every advocate of ** should be forthwith sent to Russia and forced to live under conditions he appears to ( fem. , . These are the conditions  --  but read them for yourself in the uncompromising columns of the Saturday Evening Post . You will need a stout heart and a strong stomach . That long line between drinks has nothing on the lapse between a wholesale price redaction hind the time it reaches the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
