<P> Two months ago the Polish Sejm ( Parliament ) attempted to convene . Ninety officers with clanking sabres and big black pistols stomped into the building . The Dictator of Poland , Military Josef Pilsudski , and his chief opponent . Civilian Marshal Ignacy Daszynski , snarled at each other across a table . The Sejm adjourned ( TIME , Nov.11 ) . <P> Unlike other dictators , Marshal Pilsudski 's official position is merely that of Minister of War . Last week , invigorated by enforced vacation , the deputies resolutely carried out their purpose to convene , listened to a two-hour speech from Finance Minister Matuszewski , promptly next day ousted the government of Prime Minister Switalski by a vote of " No Confidence . " <P> Usual Polish pandemonium broke out . Communists unfurled a huge red banner , flapped it in the faces of government deputies who closed their eyes and lustily bawled the " War Song of the Legionaries of the First Brigade " ( favorite Pilsudski anthem ) , then marched from the hall . <P> The retirement of prime ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilsudski . Ex-Prime Minister Switalski and parliamentary leaders waited hat in hand in the Pilsudski antechamber last week to learn who he thought should be the next prime minister .
