0NCE , in those dear , dead days when high-school girls wore pleated skirts almost to their ankles and opaque lisle stockings be ? neath them , I was publicly rebuked by my teacher for crossing my knees in the classroom . Not more than three inches of shin were visible below my voluminous plaid skirt , but those three inches were made the basis of a fifteen-minute lecture on the proprieties by the shrivelled little spinster in starched white shirtwaist and whaleboned collar who taught us French . Beginning with the abstract moralities , her homily ended with the more concrete announce ? ment that nice young men would never find themselves attracted to immodest young women who showed their limbs in public . Those were the days in which moral suasion was beginning to take on a somewhat pragmatic air . Twenty years previous to this , 1 should probably have been told that for a female to expose a small section of her limb was wicked andan offense to God ; but to the flaming youth of my high-school days God was already becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had faintly exciting connotations . Holly ? wood had not yet discovered sex appeal , but much of the moral training of girls , at least , was based upon a refined version of that primitive lure . Instead of " God does n't like , " it was " Men do n't like that sort of thing . " Men or boys , we were told , might temporarily " rush " the fast type of girl who powdered too freely , stayed out after twelve , and permitted herself to be kissed , but they never , simply never , married that kind . They were really attracted by the sweet , wholesome girl who , while independent , was still refined and acted and dressed in good taste . To be " intriguing " in a refined way was the ambition of the average girl and the mainspring of her conduct . For boys the persuasion to morality and good conduct was quite different . Inasmuch as they were to be the ag gressors in relation to the opposite sex , it did not matter so much what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak-minded for them to consider girls ' preferences at all . As with the girl , the threat of God 's wrath as a punishment for misdemeanors had lost its per ? suasiveness , and parents were reduced to arguments of expediency . The boy who smoked or stayed out late was endangering his chances for the football Or track team . Clean , simple living was essential to health that , in turn , was essential to the athletic prowess which all boys coveted . All this , in turn , was essential to success in business and professional life , which was the coveted goal after school days . The boy who hung around a pool room could never expect to become a captain of industry or even a successful bond salesman . A successful career was the reward of virtue dangled before the eyes of the adolescent boy just as a successful marriage was to be the reward of the refined and accomplished girl . Those of us who were blessed with somewhat " advanced " parents received certain delicate hints regarding the Facts of Life , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The beliefs in Santa Claus and in the Stork usually pass from the child 's mind at about the same time . The physiological facts conveyed to us at adolescence were both belated and inadequate . There were a thousand things about ourselves and our relation to the opposite sex which we needed to know , but no physi ? ology book would have covered these points , and our parents were either too ignorant of them or too inarticulate to express them . The psychological as ? pects of those relationships were as im ? portant as the physiological , but no one thought or talked about them then . Perhaps a sufficiently objective vocabu ? lary had not yet been invented in those pre-Freudian days . If our parents were beginning to dis ? count the more primitive aspects of fundamentalism , they still clung toquite arbitrary standards of conduct . I remember that when my daring girl cousin of seventeen was caught smoking a cigarette her mother wept for two days , and the rumor spread among the rela ? tives that she would probably turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents seem to have been without religious con ? victions ? at least , I was never sent to Sunday School or given religious in ? struction but the code by which I lived was practically that of my little Roman Catholic and Methodist neighbors . I should do as I was told because I was told . I was told that certain things were wrong but not why they were wrong . Being a girl , there were things I must n't do because they were unlady ? like , and people did n't like unladylike girls . I must not contradict older people . I must respect gray hairs ? a doctrine which I greeted with violent and vocif ? erous " whys . " It would have been more convenient for my parents to have answered , " because God says so " ; but they were already on the threshold of a rationalistic age . We who are the parents of our present youngest generation can not approach the problem of our own parental diffi ? culties without some understanding of our relationship to the generation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own upbringing . To every new generation of adults the codes of its fathers , as it looks back upon them , must seem inadequate in the light of new necessities . The faith men lived by yesterday never seems to answer com ? pletely the requirements of to-day . I think that the break has been particu ? larly definite between ourselves and our parents . Between us and them have come war on an unprecedented scale , revolution , counter-revolution , social chaos , disillusion with all the bright slogans which claimed our youthful en ? thusiasms , a general deflation of idealism . Perhaps in Europe , in the disturbed forties , there was a similar acceleration in life which left father and son , mother and daughter several generations apart . At no time perhaps has the actual world of reality been much like the one for which teachers and parents prepared us ; but at no time , I think , has there been the difficulty of adjustment which faced that generation which had its childhood and youth just before , and its adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including certainly our own Civil War , has been followed by an era of graft and plunder in public life , dis ? illusion and confusion in private life . We can not set men to doing all the things they had been taught were brutal and uncivilized without producing in many of them a cynical disregard for all social codes . Those of us who came into adulthood in this last war-time world found later that we had somehow achieved either a hard-boiled surface or a protective coloration . Having lived through an era of " blood and guts , " actually , or vicariously through newspapers and magazines , we found that our sense of the niceties of speech and conduct had become blunted . In life , literature , and drama we saw reflected our need for stronger stimuli , cruder sensation , more strident appeals . I remember my horror , during the early World War days , when I read Barbusse 's Under Fire , Lat zko 's Men . in War , and Ellen LaMotte 's book , The Backwash of War . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabulary than any of these , failed to stir me either to pity or indignation . Like most of my generation , I had become immunized to shock . The same held true in the social world . Some of us , having been raised in a world in which men and women , when they drank at all , drank " like gentlemen " and knew how to hold their liquor , graduated into a world in which it had become the convention , almost the moral obligation , at parties , to " pass out " as speedily as the supply of gin would permit . Raised in a period in which it was considered unladylike for a girl toshow the calf of her leg , we graduated into a world in which girls came to cos ? tume parties in two bandana handker ? chiefs , wore street dresses above their knees , and were afraid of being thought inhibited . While we were still groping in the wreckage of our own shattered beliefs , feeling for some foothold of reality upon which to take our stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so long ago suddenly found our ? selves called upon to act as guides , teachers , and friends to another genera ? tion . I can imagine that there are large numbers of people to whom this prospect is not terrifying . Probably most people do not find it so . They are still strong in the faith of their fathers . Neither social cataclysms nor Einsteinian dis ? coveries have power to make them doubt . They will raise their children , as their grandfathers did theirs before them , regardless of the fact that these children will have a world to face totally unlike the old . Such people live in a state of happy certainty about God and man . But , except in the most rural districts , I think they may be the last of their kind . Whatever professions of conformity and belief the young may make for the sake of family peace , the world has become too closely knit together for new atti ? tudes to be excluded much longer . This may seem the rash conclusion of a city dweller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of his city 's sophistication ; but the " New York idea " of to-day becomes the " Des Moines idea " of to-morrow . Those of us who have grown up and become parents in this world of shifting uncertainties must envy our forefathers the pure whites and blacks of their moral horizons . Life was conveniently simple in those days of good and evil when everyone knew just what to do and just what to tell the children . There was no more virtue and no less evil in the world perhaps , but the virtuous had no troublesome doubts concerning the source of their sanctity and the sinner knew just where he stood with God and man . But if the ancient taboos based upon the wrath of God no longer served our parents in the days of our youth , so their more pragmatic codes , which claimed material success as the reward of virtue and good taste , can no longer serve us who are the parents of to-day . It is idle to tell our adolescent daughters , even those who look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't like them if they do certain things . All about them they can see older girls violating all the taboos and ending up in the odor of sanctity and orange blos ? some with thoroughly eligible males . Those who look forward to careers out ? side of marriage are likely to answer this argument with " Well , what of it ? " All about them they see happy , useful single women living their own lives and having a good time . They know and we know that much of what was considered bad taste yesterday has become quite acceptable to-day . Nor can we tell our boys that success is wholly a matter of hard work , clean living , and personal integrity . We our ? selves know better . We have grown more cynical on this point than on any other . We know that success comes more often to the shrewd and unscrupu ? lous , the hard-boiled bargainer and the insensitive egotist than to the fine , sensitive , and generous human being . We know that the qualities of a gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of that word ? are more likely to be a drawback than an asset in the struggle for success . Tolerance , wide interests , a sense of genuine values , intellectual integrity , and emotional maturity are not the qualities which make one rich in worldly goods . All about us , with a few exceptions , we see men with vulgar and immature minds inheriting the earth . Perhaps this is not so true in the pro ? fessions ; but even here , if the predatory mind is less common , it is usually the single-tracked , highly specialized mindthat achieves Rolls Royces . This has been true in other generations , but they have had less courage to admit the fact . Yet , in spite of what seems a complete extraversion of our civilization , we mod ? erns , as the advertisements put it , are indulging in a self-searching introspec ? tion and a social criticism such as no American generation before us has known ? and here perhaps lies our hope of salvation as well as the source of our confusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialism , ostentatious display , and crude entertainment , on the other hand we are producing an analytical literature and drama which , ranging from gentle interpretation to savage satire , constitute a challenge to our social philosophy and our individual conduct . The drama and literature of social criticism have been with us since the days of the Greeks , but to social criti ? cism we have added a complete under ? standing of individual psychology . if " Abie 's Irish Rose " ran for five years in New York , " Strange Interlude " has played to packed houses for over a year , even though it has clone so by grace of the publicity entailed in winning the Pulitzer Prize and a reputation for dar ? ing . It is difficult to see how even those who came to snicker and be shocked could have remained entirely immune to its critical implications . If a great mass of unthinking people is increasingly engrossed in material prosperity , an intelligent minority is increasingly self-conscious , self-critical , disillusioned . We have seen so ninny platitudes proven false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many gods toppled from their pedestals in the last fifteen years . However much we may go through the old rites for the sake of our jobs , our families , or our social standing , in our hearts we hold few things sacred , save , perhaps , some degree of personal integrity . If we are honest , decent , discriminating in ex perience and considerate of our fellows , it is because we choose to be for the sake of our own approval , not because we expect success in this or eternal life in another world to result from our right ? eousness . We have found many of our parents ' codes inadequate to the com ? plicated situations we have had to face in a changing world , and so we have had to fall hack upon whatever inner light we have been able to summon for our judgments . We suspect that whatever codes we may now impose upon our children may be inadequate to the new problems they will confront in a still changing world of twenty years hence . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know that then , as now , there will be basic offenses which no man can commit with impunity , but we do not seriously expect our children to be tempted to those offenses . Murder and theft will never be tolerated in any civilized community , but how , for ex ? ample , will the world of twenty years hence feel about the wholesale murder called War ? Shall we teach our sons to abhor such a solution of international difficulties and , if so , will they find them ? selves at twenty-five or thirty , part of a civilized majority that has outlawed war , or part of a despised minority of conscientious objectors in some Federal prison ? But these are simple problems com ? pared to the more subtle ones of our sons ' and daughters ' whole general ad ? justment to life and to other people , particularly to the opposite sex . Be ? cause it is here that the greatest changes are taking place and we who are groping blindly for some philosophy of life upon which to base our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few decades . That life will not be simple for our children seems fairly certain . That it will be less simple for our daugh ? ters than for our sous is also certain , be ? cause it is in the status of women that the greatest shifts are being made . In the relations between men and women , growing out of these changes , most ofthe unhappinesses and difficulties of life arise . Even the most trivial of these difficulties will have a momentary seri ? ousness for the people involved . Just a year ago , at a costume party , I was followed into the cloakroom by a young girl whom I knew slightly . She was almost in tears and said she wanted advice and perhaps the loan of her taxi fare . The man with whom she had come to the party wanted to go home and had asked her to go back with him to his apartment . When she had re ? fused he had accused her of being " a bad sport ? a repressed little Puritan , " etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I think she should do , she asked . Was she really being inhibited or silly ? Of course , her mother would think the proposal insulting ; but one could n't feel that way these days . Bill probably thought he was complimenting her on her seductiveness . She really was quite modern and she hated being a prude , but he was tipsy and she was afraid she could n't handle him ? yet , she did n't want to be a bad sport . She was asking me , as someone between her mother 's generation and her own , who could understand the situation . . . " Do you want to go ? " I asked her . " No . He makes me sick when he 's drunk , but ? " " Then do n't go . Surely , you are uninhibited enough to know what you want and to do as you like about it . Tell Bill to go home and sleep it off . " She left the room with the sacred fire of personal freedom kindling in her eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught between the training of her home life and the intellectual preten ? sions of her own generation , was totally unprepared . In her mother 's day young men did not take young girls to parties and then get tipsy . If they had , they would have been ostracized from polite society . The girl rightly felt that to assume the outraged " How dare you , Jack Dalton ! " attitude of a former day would have been silly and out of place because Bill was really a good sort when sober , and she would have to meet him again and again in a society in which drunkenness was considered more amusing than taboo . Neither was she prepared for the completely casual attitude toward such matters professed by so many young moderns . She wanted to be , as she expressed it later , " free but not messy " ? a difficult feat of tightrope walking for girls of nineteen , if not for those of us who are somewhat older . It may be said that a serene and wholesome home life is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory adjustment to all these problems ; that with such a background he can face the complications of adulthood and work out his own solutions . This is probably true to some extent , but it is becoming increasingly difficult to assure him that serene and wholesome home life . Modern parents are becoming more and more conscious of their indi ? vidual needs and more desirous of play ? ing other roles than the parental . Intel ? ligent , well-rounded men and women who are something more than just parents are the ones best fitted by insight and wisdom to be the guides and companions of youthful souls , but they are also the men and women who need other forms of self-expression . Their attempts to combine these varying needs and desires , together with the solution of their practical problems , may result in strained and difficult household situations . I suspect that the seeming wholesomeness of our ancestral homes has been greatly overrated . Certainly as we look back upon our oldest living generation and upon the lives of our parents , with their fears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear rather than protest against , we begin to realize that the neurotic was not invented by Freud and Jung . In ? deed , our own scarred egos bear silent witness to the none-too-wholesome back ? grounds of the less complicated decades . Furthermore , whatever the home may or may not be in this crowded life we live , we can not keep the world outside from impinging upon the consciousness of our children . Before they begin to read , the radio , the comic strip , and the chatter of neighbors all bring the con ? temporary world to their intelligence . When they have begun to read we can ? not keep out of our houses the newspapers , magazines , novels , books , and dramatic reviews upon which the adult mind must feed . And once in the house , we can not keep them from the intelligent and in ? quiring child unless they are written in too dull a manner to engage his interest . The adolescent child can not be kept in a nursery , even were nurseries practicable in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the serious problem play , but it is difficult to keep him away from the movies where the same problem is presented with either a smirk or a , sentimental varnish . Recently I received a leiter from an intelligent friend , discussing this prob ? lem . " What should every young girl know ? " she wrote . " I find it rather difficult to decide . The physical aspect of the thing is so simple and so inade ? quate . Joan has known all about the basic facts of sex since she was seven . That was no problem . Her whole atti ? tude ou the subject is clean , informed , normal . But now she is thirteen and beginning to read everything she can lay her hands on . The other day she returned from a week-end with a friend and announced that she had read Hem ? ingway 's novel The Sun Also Rises . That certainly is no book for a thirteen ? year-old . What was I to do about it ? She knew that I had read the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would have given the whole thing an undue importance in her mind . I remembered the eagerness with which I bad read The Lady of the Camellias when I was thir ? teen and how glamorous the whole thing had been because it was forbidden . I did n't want to make Hemingway 's shopworn heroine glamorous to Joan nor could I dismiss her by calling her a wicked woman and her admirers drunken sots . That 's what my own parents would have told me , but neither she nor they quite fitted into those categories now . Joan was bursting with questions about them ? people who did things she thought were ' pretty rotten ' and yet seemed intelligent and likable . Why did they drink so much and why did Brett go off with one man when she was engaged to another ? There was nothing to do but go through with it , and I spent the next hour trying to interpret in some way she could understand that bewil ? dered , hopeless crowd of post-war ex ? patriates one sees haunting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation and some of their problems were my problems , but I had n't begun to think them through . I found that this interpretation really involved a philosophy of life ? which I did n't have . I came nearer to formulat ? ing one in the hour that followed than I ever had before . Then I told Joan that , while I did n't want to censor her reading , there were books in the house which I preferred she would n't read until she was a little older because she had not yet had sufficient experience from which to evolve a standard of judgment about them ; that an adult might read a book much as a biologist might dissect an interesting but disagreeable object in a laboratory , in order to understand that object as a part of life and to relate that understanding to his own experience . But until one had had experience , until life itself had taught one a great deal about oneself and about other human beings , books of this sort were useless to one and only likely to mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed to understand what I was getting at . " I can imagine that this situation is a common one in modern parental ex ? perience . We Americans live in closer contact with our children than do most Europeans . In the average American family the adolescent child stays up until nine or ten , studying or taking partin the conversation with parents and guests . Among intelligent people this conversation may cover a range of subjects outside the child 's experience and arouse his interest in those subjects . In these days when the pathological as well as the normal aspects of life are so freely discussed and analyzed , it is difficult for the modern parent to draw a conversational line . Frequently the child achieves an ap ? parent sophistication which has no rela ? tion to any experience it may have en ? countered in either home or school and which leaves the bewildered parent pondering the hopelessness of any at ? tempt to guide the footsteps of his progeny . Last summer , at the country home of a friend , the two small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show " during a rainy afternoon . They were nine and eleven . During the winter mouths they attended a private city school , and their summers were spent on a hundred-acre farm . They had never been permitted to sit up after dinner and listen to the family dis ? cussions . After a short , giggling session above stairs , the two children emerged upon the make-believe stage at the end of the room . The younger , in an old dress of her mother 's , was cast in the role of an indignant maiden aunt , while the older , very d ? collet ? in her bloomers and a silk shawl , draped Spanish-wise , was evidently giving us her version of a John Held , Jr. , flapper in an advanced state of intoxication . She puffed a choc ? olate cigarette vigorously . The maid ? en aunt , in the high thin voice that children always assume when they imi ? tate their elders , proceeded to lecture the inebriated flapper upon the error of her ways and the lateness of her return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this at two o'clock in the morning ? " she demanded , trying to look severe . " Do n't you know that nice girls do n't do such things ? " To which the eleven-year-old mimic of the younger generation replied with an abandoned sweep of her shawl , " Aw , baloney ! " Neither the language nor the situation used by these children could have been a matter of first-hand knowledge . Even the movies to which they were taken were carefully chosen . There remained only the Sunday newspapers , a magazine illustration , or the conversation of their playmates to account for the precocity of their little drama . Occasionally one meets a modern parent who , in reaction against the re ? pressions and futilities of his own up ? bringing or because of his bewilderment in the face of moral complexities , has determined on a course of complete in ? dividual liberty for his children . I once knew a man whose stern New England training had soured his own capacity for relaxation and enjoyment . He was determined that his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would never hear the word do n't , never find their natural impulses cramped by repressive authority . As a result of his experiment , the most philoprogenitive visitor can not leave his house without having stifled an impulse to strangle the three young barbarians who kick , scream , and ravage through the place , making conversation impossible and a headache inevitable . That their first contact with a hard-headed world in which some impulses must be restrained and in which men and women must live together in some degree of mutual consideration may produce neuroses far worse than did the repressions of his own childhood has never occurred to this modern father . The dilemma of the modern parent is not so easily resolved . We are prepar ? ing our children for life as it is and prob ? ably will be for some time . We want them to live fully , freely , happily in a world of other human beings . Complete individual liberty in a complex civiliza ? tion is obviously chimerical . That there is room in our civilization for a fargreater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite obvious . We all are hampered in our lives by outworn taboos and conventions which have lost all essential meaning and the breakdown of which would injure no one . Every human being has a right to decide for himself what degree of discomfort or social ostracism he is willing to endure for casting aside these outworn symbols , and the courage to do this is one of the characteristics which the modern parent will wish his children to possess . But here again we are somewhat be ? wildered . We know from experience and observation , whatever our purely intellectual revolt has been , that certain conventions under which we live and which hamper to some extent our free ? dom of movement have not been super ? imposed upon us , but have been built up on the basis of racial experience during long ages of human struggle . They have survived because they have best answered the deepest needs of the race . We know that the mere breakdown of restraint in the immature soul leads no ? where . If we have had an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the belated adolescents who dis ? port themselves in certain modernist circles , we have probably felt the urge to proffer the advice of the Dr. Freud of Anita Loos 's classic to its preferred blonde heroine ? " Go home and get a few inhibitions . " If we know something of psychological science , we know that the flamboyantly " free soul " is often acting out some inner compulsion of which he is unaware . Few of us have reached very definite conclusions about our own or other people 's conduct . We do things which are forbidden by law , the Bible , and the Book of Etiquette without conscious ? ness of guilt ; but to many of us there are acts and attitudes permitted by all these authorities which seem impossible . I drink wine with my dinner , covet my neighbor 's fur coat , and cut my salad with a knife , but I should find it impos ? sible , I fear , to foreclose on a mortgage if I held one . Both time and circum ? stances may alter these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel about a certain thing at a certain time ; and those of us who have lost faith in the immutability of rules of conduct can use only what good judg ? ment we possess . So fluctuating a code as this , however , must presuppose some inner stability and maturity if life is to be something more than a disordered mess and our convictions a mere rationalization of our impulses . We can not expect the child or the young boy and girl to have this stability . Somewhere between the out worn practice of complete authoritarian ism and the utopian ideal of a complete individual liberty we must take a stand which will prepare the child for the ac tual world in which he will have to live . I imagine that the cowed and obedient son of a stern unbending Puritanism and 1 the young Nietzschean egotist of militant anarchist training may have an equally uncomfortable time of it in the 1940 's . Perhaps there is little that the parent can do for the child 's equipment com pared with what is done by the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To many children the p world outside the home carries more weight than the world inside it . But what little direction and help we could offer most of us are unable to give be ? cause of our inability to be completely honest with ourselves . We know that our own attitudes differ from those of our parents . We know how inadequately equipped we were to meet a world in which the old rules were not always ap ? plicable , but we shut our eyes to the fact that many of the traditions which we hold dear may be passing . Al ! about us we see happy honest people doing things that would have brought the law upon them a few generations ago and which bring social disapproval even now ; but we refuse to face the fact that their ways may possibly be the forerunners of general practice in the world of our children 's maturity . Our attitude to ? ward most social problems is that of the average man 's attitude toward the pro ? hibition amendment . The average man does as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on the statute books as a mystical inducement to other people 's sobriety . I have said that it is in the status of women that the greatest changes are taking place and in the relationships of men and women affected by those changes that many of our difficulties arise . If love and marriage in our day are complicated problems , they may be even more so to our children unless we are able to give them a saner approach to these subjects than we ourselves have known . The woman of the next genera ? tion may know better what she wants and where she is going than we who are caught between the old allegiances and the new ambitions ; but whatever her decision may be about herself , the men of the next generation will need to adjust themselves to it with better grace and completer understanding than have their fathers . As economic conditions continue to push back the age at which men and women can settle down to mar ? riage and family life , some adjustment of the relations of young men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it impossible for a man to support a family until he is over thirty ; but nothing can keep young people from falling in love before that time nor from seeking some outlet for their impulses . We can leave them to approach this subject in the old shamefaced , furtive , or accidental manner of our own youth or we can help them to some understanding of both physical and emotional values that will keep them alike from needless repressions and from premature and trivial indulgences . We can not help them without com ? plete honesty with ourselves and them . If , in order to save ourselves the trouble of thinking through the conflicts which confront us and of formulating a personal philosophy , we attempt to impose upon them some ready-made code out of keep ing with their time , we shall merely drive them from us . All about us we see ample evidence , in our empty churches and our empty homes , of what this course can do . Preachers and parents may at ? tempt to rationalize these phenomena as they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what many of them have called " the old hokum " any longer . I think that if we were to tell them frankly that we ourselves are puzzled and bewildered by many of the problems of modern life , that we are not always sure what is best , that we are trying to think and feel our way through , just as they are , to conclusions which are socially workable and individually satis ? fying , they might be interested in making these intellectual excursions with us , helping us as well as themselves to satisfactory solutions . I have in mind the home of a liberal university professor which I once visited for a few days . Breakfast and dinner were always the occasions of intense and interesting discussions of every possible subject by the professor , his wife , his two children , and whatever guests were present . The professor was a pacifist , but his sixteen-year-old son with militar ? ist tendencies had joined the high school R. 0 . T. C. Father and son argued the question of preparedness all through one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated in a good-natured way . " You 're a young reactionary , " the father finally concluded . " Oh , you 're an old Bolshevik , " re ? torted his son with a good-natured grin . But the nineteen-year-old daughter leaned in the opposite direction . She did n't believe in legal marriage , she an ? nounced , and would never indulge in it , but she very much wanted three children . No one laughed at her or looked shocked . When her mother questioned a quota ? tion from Judge Lindsey , the daughter came hack with a paragraph from Westermarck 's History of Marriage . The professor backed up his daughter on some points , disagreed with her on others , and finally maneuvered her into the position of defending the rights of children to two full-time parents . An ? thropological authorities had been sum ? moned , wild surmises had been made and ripped to pieces , guests had taken part in the discussion with great gusto . It was an exciting evening . Those two children will never need to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " themselves . They can do so right at home . When they graduate from their family they will know how to think clearly and feel maturely . The ability to do these two things is probably all the modern parent can help his children to achieve . They are the tools with which the young must forge their own lives . We can stand by , offering whatever suggestions and advice seem applicable at the moment or an ? swering whatever questions are put to us as honestly and undogmatically as we know how . If we attempt to do much more than this we are likely to induce either thoughtless rebellion or spineless dependence . It is difficult for even the most modern parent to keep up this " hands off " policy . We all know so well what we should like our children to be . We are so eager that they shall avoid the mis ? takes and accidents that have made our own lives unsatisfactory . I should like my own small daughter to be the kind of woman I admire ? clear-headed , un @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and charming , with a keen brain , a warm heart , and an attractive exterior . I have no idea how such a combination of virtues may be achieved , and I know that there is little I can do to assure them for her . But I would not , if I could , as a fairy godmother , banish from her future all pain and difficulty , all struggle and misunderstanding ; for only through these can she develop an understanding of humanity . Perhaps the one redeeming feature in the situation of the modern parent is this : that if we are not very clear about what we should do , we usually have some understanding of what we should not do . Modern literature and psychol ? ogy have impressed us with the dangers of too much interference , too close emo ? tional attachments , too much mutual dependence in the relationship between parent and child . Most of us under ? stand now that we must prepare our children to live without us , not for con ? tinued devotion to us or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Psychology of the Adolescent , Dr. Leta S. Hollingworth of Teachers College , Columbia Univer ? sity , says : The major persistent problems of adoles ? cence are , as we have seen them , to get away from the family , to achieve self-support , to develop a heterosexual attitude , to formu ? late a point of view on life . When all these major adjustments have been satisfactorily managed , the adolescent has achieved psy ? chological adulthood . He has achieved emotional maturity . He has arrived at a condition of self-control and of self-posses ? sion , unified and wholesome . These , as Doctor Hollingworth says , are the major problems of adolescence . There are a host of minor ones . But all about us we see physically adult human beings , many of them parents , who are still psychologically tied to their own parents ' apron strings and who have never formulated a point of view on life . There are many who have never been able to achieve self-support and whose sexual impulses are as diffused as a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters with any of these we have emerged determined not to re ? produce another generation of their kind . To give our children the benefit of what life has taught us without curtail ? ing their right to learn from life ; to teach them the value of freedom without les ? sening their sense of responsibility to ? ward other individuals and the social group ; to make them self-reliant and eventually self-supporting without in ? oculating them with the virus of success-worship ; to make them fearless of life and whatever experience it may offer while giving them discrimination and the courage to reject what is foreign to them ? all this is what the modern parent day-dreams of doing . Is it any wonder that in our more wide-awake moments we are staggered by the job that con ? fronts us or that in moments of weakness we may sometimes yearn for the days when a personal God was in his heaven and father laid down the law from the head of the table ?             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
