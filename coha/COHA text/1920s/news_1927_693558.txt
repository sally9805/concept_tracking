txt Mayor Dever is ready for the light . Ho smiled last night as he sat in his Kenmore avenue home and listened to the primary returns over the radio . There was a glint of the joy of battle in his eyes . " What kind of a campaign will you make ? " he was asked . " I never can tell just what I am going to say until I get on my feet , " was the reply . " My present inclination is not to dwell on the depressing history of the past , but on present opportunities . and future needs of Chicage . " Chimgo is good enough to be saved . " I would like to talk about achievements and possibilities , let the people know what the traction situation is , just how our material growth might be increased or retarded , how our finances have been straightened out , tell them of the great work of our departments and bring them into a deeper Interest in the affairs of government .

" Any person who knows these needs and glimpses her great future , her unparalleled progress , will see how futile must be the effect on good government of a campaign that does not bring home to the minds and consciences of the people the difficulties and importance of governmental prob . lems . " We have had a long , hard pull to bring the city to the point where It is doing business on a cash basis , where bills are paid promptly and creditors get their money .

I intend to present it to them in a concrete way if I can get the owners and the committee to sit at a table ' and agree on a plan . " The gigantic work of straightening the river is about to start- Work has already begun on some bridge heads . The new city that will develop in that direction should be pointed out . In a year or so La Salle street will be widened to a new boulevard from the loop to the park . The new Wacker drive is an outstanding example of performance of public Work of a farseeing character .

We have added 73 ; 500 seats for children of school age , and have improved the educational methods under which 505 , - 000 future citizens arc learning . " Deep in the heart of many abides the hope that some superman will appear or , the horizon who , through his own power and personality , will ' lift the innate moral level of a city like Chicago . That is an impossible dream . It the home fails us , if the school fails us , if religion fails us , we will meet with certain disappointment when we turn to officialdom armed only with the power of physical force , for permanent relief . " We must turn hack to the child. , the mind of the future , to lift the mind of our democracy . And in teaching the children to read and love books - we must give them the measure of opportunity for self-thinking .
