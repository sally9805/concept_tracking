txt Far more blessed a word than " Mesopotamia " is " efficiency . " It is the " word of power , " the universal abracadabra of this time ; but it does n't always act as well as it sounds . The other day-the United States Bureau of Efficiency , a much more imposing and expensive body than the Civil Service Commission from which , It sprang , hauled its unfortunate parent over the coals . In Good Government Mr. Wieeiam DUDLEY FOUL , K E makes some neat historical and critical remarks about this critic . In 1912 an act of Congress directed the Civil Service Commission to provide a system of efficiency ratings for the Federal classified service .. in the District of Columbia , fixing a minimum rating for promotion and a Maximum for demotion and dismissal , tinder civil service rules . Subsequently there were disagreements between the then President of the commission and Mr. HEITBERT F. BROWN . Chief of . the Efficiency Division ; and there was more or less dissatisfaction with the methods of the commission . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , quite in the Gilbert-Sullivan tradition , congress , in 1916 , created a separate Bureau of Efficiency to which the officers of the . Division of Efficiency were transferred . To set . up two agencies to do the work of one is a truly Congressional notion of efficiency . The business of the commission in the examination , certification , probation , appointment of candidates is indispensably related to their efficiency , to promotions , . demotions and so on : . lievenc , . vind . Let the two , bratichei. work separately and in the.dark . Besides , the ' bipartite system has the merit of being expensive ; and what is expensive is politically efficient . - By duplication we thrive . Chief BROWN 'S salary is twice that of the humble Civil Service Commissioners . The bureau began modestly with an appropriation of $40,000 . In five years this grew to $135,000 . In March , 1917 , Congress directed the bureau to investigate the commission 's methods and report through the President . This again was charmingly " efficient . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the hands of soniebody with an ancient grudge . But watch efficiency effice . ) The work of the bureau , established ' Feb. 28 , 1916 , " was interrupted by ' the war . " Well , suppose the work was started afresh on the day after the armistice . It took nearly three years , till Oct. 24 , 1921 , to get the efficiency rating system prepared and started ; not till March 25 , 1922 , did the regulations appear . Yet the bureau must have been busy . all the time , for in 1919 it received a letter from the commission , whose appropriation had been cut from $300,000 to $50,000 , asking suggestions to help it function with a diminished staff . The chief has been too busy to answer . On Nov. 2 , 1920 , the bureau sent the commission for comment the proposed report of the investigation , a work of 350 pages , and asked that it be returned within a week . The inefficient commission managed to return it within two weeks . In a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureau sent to congress through the President its final report of 113 pages , " materially different from the first , " and without having sent it to the commission , as it had promised . With its criticisms and the commission 's replies to them we are not here concerned . It is happiness enough to exhibit to a discriminating public the singular efficiency of the Bureau of Efficiency .
