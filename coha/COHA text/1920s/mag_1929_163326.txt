CLASS REUNION-Franz Werfel-Simon &; Schuster ( $2 ) . <P> In a " prep " school near New York in 1902 , would the entire student body seriously prepare and abide by a shrewd timetable for playing hookey ? Would the rich boys and the well-born boys form a clique under the dominance of the literary boy , listen to his poems , read their own , play the ouija board , indulge with equal zest in philosophy and barroom wenches ? And despise footballers for brainless oxen ? Would U. S. students consider cheating on marks a crime from whose penalty , legal and moral , suicide was a welcome escape ? <P> In 1902 at the Nikolaus Gymnasium outside Vienna such things happened . Author Werfel 's story , the story of Sebastian and Adler , tells about it . Behind Sebastian 's soft eyes seethed envy-envy of Adler , the literary boy . Reason : the couple 's clique acclaimed Adler Mentally Most High . Sebastian , craving that title , decided first to make Adler feel inferior . Failing to compete with Adler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . That hurt Adler . Sebastian wrestled with Adler , pinned him to the mat , made him kneel for a sweetmeat , caught him with a harlot . That broke Adler . When the clique laughed at Adler , Adler laughed too , a self-annihilating laugh . All Adler 's superiority seemed to vanish . <P> Yet did it vanish ? A quarter-century later , now 43 and a Judge , Sebastian still feels superior . He meets a convict whom he ( wrongly ) thinks is Adler . He goes into a turmoil and says , " When we were boys together , your finer nature made a criminal of me : but when I had driven you away , you robbed me of my soul forever . Now when death seems ridiculously close to me , I accuse you of ruining my life . For I was fated to love you ! " When Sebastian discovers his mistake about the convict 's identity , he realized that not his sight but Divine Truth deceived him . Thus , Author Werfel concludes his thesis ( from Goethe ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon or remedy save love . "
