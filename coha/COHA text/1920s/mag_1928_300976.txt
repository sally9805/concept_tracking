It was an odd coincidence that the three outstanding new women office-seekers in the campaign were all named Ruth . All ran for Congress . All were widows , two were grandmothers . Two were able daughters of famed politicos . All three campaigned without emphasis on their sex . They were two Republicans and one Democrat , but all represented the new type of political woman . They were all ladies of greater wealth than previous women Congressmen have been . One 's husband had been a Senator and his seat in the Senate was her ultimate goal . But none was a Representative 's widow , as has usually been the case with Congresswomen . <P> Many a flat joke was made about the next Congress not being " Ruthless " and about this being the campaign of the four Ruths , since Baseballer George Herman ( " Babe " ) Ruth was stumping for the Brown Derby ( see p. 9 ) . The three ladies were : <P> 1 ) Ruth Bryan Owen of Florida , daughter of the late Great Commoner . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Modern conditions required her to substitute practical thinking for the passionate oratory that might have been her inherited forte . Long before the Smith tariff declaration at Louisville , she found it necessary to declare for Protection , which her father fought so long . Florida has changed since the Commoner first invested in its real estate and conducted prayer meetings there . Northern business men and methods opened a new field for northern political ideas and attitudes . Ruth Bryan Owen had to adapt herself and did so grudgingly . Besides the new Tariff ideas in her party , she balked at Tammany and the " grape juice " tradition of her family was affronted by the Smith wetness . She refused to let the National Committee use her photograph . <P> 2 ) Ruth Baker Pratt of New York , widow of a Republican financier , campaigned with the experience of a society clubwoman who had come through the rough-and-tumble of big-city politics . Even Manhattan 's " silk stocking " district has its seamy side . Mrs. Pratt encountered Tammany methods within her own party before securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opposed for nomination by a highly professional State Assemblyman , Phelps Phelps . Her primary victory seemed due to her astute counsellors more than to her social appeal . The seat in Congress which she sought was held by one Tammanyite and defended by another , both Jews . A woman Socialist , Bertha Mailly , also ran . Mrs. Pratt was expected to win because " Broadway 's Congressman " is normally Republican . She made a vigorous campaign , renouncing weekends in the country all summer and fall .
