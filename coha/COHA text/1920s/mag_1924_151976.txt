DOCTOR DOLITTLE 'S CIRCUS-Hugh Lofting-Stokes ( $2.50 ) . The Doctor Dolittle stories are for children or grown people or both . Hugh Walpole calls one of them " the first real children 's classic since Alice . " Doctor Dolittle is probably the only man in the world who talks animal language-in all dialects . His adventures are varied - one of the most entertaining being his connivance in the escape of Sophie , the trained seal . The good doctor 's intimates are all with him-Jip , the dog ; Dab-Dab , the duck ; Too-Too , the owl ; Gub-Gub , the pig ; Matthew Mugg , the Cat 's meatman . The book is excellent propaganda for the prevention of cruelty to animals .
