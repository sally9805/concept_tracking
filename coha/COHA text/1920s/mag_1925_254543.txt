In Manhattan , before the U. S. Federal Trade Commission , witnesses testified that Irish lace was a mere trade name . Large quantities of the lace were made in France and China and it was pointed out that the adjective " Irish " designated a type and not the country in which it was made . <P> One Lindsay Crawford , representing the Irish Free State , said that a determined effort was to be made against calling any product " Irish " that was not made in Ireland . The effort , he continued , is to be directed against those who sell " Irish " poplin , mackerel , butter and other products . <P> Returning to lace , he went on : <P> " The statement that the amount of lace imported from Ireland during the last few years was so small as to be negligible is not accurate , because most of the Irish lace went to England and was shipped from there as an English product . In England , the trademark laws are so strict that no one dares to misbrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the English trade was concerned . <P> " Ireland now has a stable Government , statistics are being kept and , before long , we will be able to make accurate reports concerning our imports and exports . In the meantime , we intend to prevent merchants from calling inferior goods by an Irish name . This injures us and restricts our market . "
