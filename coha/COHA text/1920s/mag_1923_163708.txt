By a roundabout way came information of another important American 's opinion of prohibition . In London was published a book , The Law of the Kinsmen , by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline , consisting of addresses made in this country and articles which appeared in England . The work has a preface by William Howard Taft , in which , among other things , the Chief Justice spoke of law enforcement in America , particularly with respect to prohibition . <P> The Chief Justice stated his belief that prohibition had come to stay , but characterized the effect of the law as " demoralizing " because it had added to the criminal classes " a group of well-to-do men and women , usually an element of strength in enforcing law . " <P> Mr. Taft explained : " In the colder and calmer state of the public mind , the reform is found to be at variance with the habits of many of our people , especially in the large cities , and in the outset the law has become most difficult to enforce . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the attitude of some well-to-do and intelligent people who protest against the justice and wisdom of the law , and who treat with levity its violations when such violations serve to furnish them the wines and liquors they wish to have for their own enjoyment .
