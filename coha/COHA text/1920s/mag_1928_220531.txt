Visitors in the U. S. last week included : <P> <P> Mme. Chaliapin . She appears to be Russian . She looks about 45 . Tall , with grey eyes and a fair complexion , she has luxuriant dark hair .

Princess Xenia . " <P> Thus it became a settled fact that rich Mrs. William B. Leeds , born Princess Xenia of Russia , is actually the hostess of the young woman who landed in Manhattan , last fortnight , claiming to be the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) . From Mrs. Leeds ' cable it may be inferred that she believes the young woman 's story that she was saved from being murdered with the rest of the Imperial Family by a Red soldier called Tchaikovsky whom she later married .

" <P> A slight man , with greying hair , the Bishop was born in 1885 of parents who had recently been converted to Catholicism . Last week , as he descended the gang plank of the De Grasse , several Japanese Roman Catholics crowded respectfully forward to kiss his massive bishop 's ring . <P> On the day after he landed , Bishop Hayasaka became the first Japanese ever to officiate at a Pontifical High Mass at St. Patrick 's Cathedral . <P> The diocese of Bishop Hayasaka is that of Nagasaki , Japanese town , which was an insignificant village until Christian missionaries made it their headquarters in the 16th Century .
