With the death of His Imperial Majesty Yoshihito Tenno ( TIME , Jan. 3 ) there began last week the usual sacrifices of loyal subjects in his honor . Hundreds of young girls cut off their hair and burned it ceremoniously in the temples . Stalwart youths pierced veins and painted in blood devout ideographic prayers for the Tenno. * Finally Baron Mansasuke Ikeda , lifelong companion of the Tenno , set up a portrait of the " Heavenly King " in his house near Tokyo , cried , " I followed you in life , I follow you in death , " and shot himself . . . . <P> Meanwhile the respected Rintaro Nishimura , hereditary hearse-maker to the Imperial House , arrived at Tokyo from Kyoto , the ancient Capital , with 50 workmen and began work on the great two-wheeled cart in which the Tenno 's remains will journey to the grave . For constructing the Imperial Hearse he will receive the princely fee of 100,000 yen ( $50,000 ) . No one else knows the secret of constructing the wheels of the funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeak . " At the hubs a mechanism capable of emitting loud groans will be installed . Finally the hearse will be made of unvarnished cypress , oak , teakwood and fir , 12 feet high , 23 feet long , the whole polished to glassy smoothness . <P> A committee of the Diet reported favorably last week the funeral budget bill , providing for a total expenditure of 2,980,000 yen ( $1,490,000 ) on the state funeral which will be held late in February . Among other expenses will be the permanent support of the oxen used to draw the Imperial Hearse , since these animals never thereafter perform labor of any kind . <P> <P> * " Heavenly King .
