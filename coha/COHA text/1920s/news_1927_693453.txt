txt Ford Madox Ford is in Chicago for " fortnight . " and because I think his work of the really great kind , because I think his three novels , " Some Do Not , " " No More Parades , " and " A Man Could Stand Up , " as good as .9 novels are made , his book about Joseph Conrad . he most stimulating thing about literary genius that any one interested in writing could read , his poems of real distinction , and the reviews he fathered the best of their kind , 1 wanted to talk to him . What he said was an so interesting that I do n't know where to begin ? perhaps about the novels . And that started with his asking me if I had ever read a novel of his called " The Good Soldier . " I hadn't. unfortunately . " It is to he reprinted very soon , " he said . " I had a contract with a French publisher for six novels in French , and for the first of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will find that the best of my work . Looking back on it after these years , I can see that it is . But it was to have been the last novel I ' was ever to write . I bade farewell to literature forever in 1914 and said that ' The Good Soldier ' was the last piece of fiction I would . ever do . " That was in July . 1914 . In August , 1914 , the Germans crossed the Belgian frontier , and for two years I never thought of writing . I was gassed , and as I was going back to the front I met another man from my outfit who was also gassed and we began to talk about the war , and I suddenly realized that . I was the only novelist of my age in the war . Just about this time I received a telegram from Conrad in-closing a fiver . A time before , when he had shown me the first draft of ' Chance , ' I bet him that it would sell 14,000 copies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two or three thousand , and he thought I was mad . I said 14,000 because there are 14,000 railway stations in England and I figured that each one of them could sell one copy . I began to take a literary view of the war from about that time . As soon as the war was over I wrote a novel . But when I came to read it over I found that I had been writing like a madman . The book was not readable . I suppressed it . And only later was I able to write about the war . " " But , " said I , " you wrote poems during the war . " " They were ordered , " he said . " The French government called me to Paris from the front and asked me to do some propaganda especially designed for the French , as separated from the English . I could n't do that , of course . Then they asked me to write some poems for the French soldiers to recite , and I wrote the poems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were later translated into English . By the way , I was sure that ' On Heaven ' could never be printed in England . " " Why ? " said I with more than curiosity , for there is n't anything in it to ban it , so far as I could see . " Because in England you ca n't say that God is a good man , you ca n't speak familiarly of God , " he replied . " It is blasphemous and you ca n't print blasphemy . But they finally decided that it might make the little English soldiers more willing to die , so they finally did allow it , and it made quite a sensation . " " Now that the three novels are finished , are you doing another ? " I asked , because I thought it my duty . They 're always doing another , but it 's always interesting to find out what it is . " I 'm doing nothing now . I write very rapidly when I start , but I al ? ways rest eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have come very often to New York for a holiday ; it makes a delightful holiday ? as slow a boat as possible , a fortnight in New York and another slow boat back . " He talked about New York . " I said in an article not long ago that the only native New Yorker I had met was a charming lady whei lived in St. Louis . Not long after that I was at a tea and Gouverneur Morris came up to me and said that every one in the room was not only a born New Yorker. but owned property in New York . I found , as I did later at a dinner party , that although they owned property in New York and were born there they did not live in New York . All of the New Yorkers live somewhere else . And so far a.9 I can see all of the middle western . ers live in Paris . I see no one in Paris but middle westerners .

As I was leaving he told me a love ? ly story about " a hot cup of tea . " The English think thitt a nice hot cup of tea is the one thing that is good for everything .

For eight hours ho was unconscious and when he woke up ho saw a nice English nurse leaning over him , saying , ' What you want Is a nice hot cup of tea . ' " I told that before a large group In New York and every one laughed except Rebecca West , who was present , " Mr. Ford said .
