txt An initial dividend on Pacific Oil Co. stock will prob . ably be discussed , and p'ssibly declared , at the first meeting of the board after the termination , on June 30 , of the ( first six months of operation . It can be stated positively that formal action on a dividend will not be taken at the meeting of the board to be held this month . A director of the company when questioned about an early declaration of di ' . idcnd policy , stated that it would clearly be unwise to commit the company to any dividend rate after only three months of independent operation . Fully six months should elapse , he stated , before such an important stop is taken . He added that it was quite probable that the dependabidty of the company 's earning power could be established well enough in that time to justify consideration of an initial dividend . Pacific Oil 's first dividend could easily be at an annual rate of $3 a share . The oil properties which the company now embraces earned almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6% dividend on Associated Oil stock owned , amounting to $1,209,000 annually , making net applicable to dividends last year  --  if company had then been in existence  --  somewhat over $19,000,000 , or about 134 a share on the 3,500,000 shares outstanding . Development of the properties has been steadily pushed forward since the first of the year . Company has agreed to furnish the Stock Exchange with a quarterly statement . It is believed that the first statement , which ir will be presented about May 1 , will show net earnings , which , with the Associated Oil dividend will exceed an annual rate of $4 a share . The recent advance of Pacific Oil from around 27 to 37 was partly the cause , and partly the result , of dividend rumors . It was widely reported at that time that the initial declaration would be on a $4 basis , and that such . declaration might be made at a special meeting to be hel.i toward the end of March . There will be no meeting , however , until the regular monthly meeting toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter may be submitted to the directors . Earnings for the quarter will be in the hands of New York officials about the 20th of the first following month . and the report to the Stock Exchange will be made a few days later . Compuny's.balance sheet will show no assumed liabilities . It began its corporate existence with a clean slate so far as funded liabilities were concerned . Amount of its working capital depends largely on the extent of ' development of property since the first of the year . The company received $8,750,000 from the $52,500,000 subscriptions to its capital stock , $43,750,000 of which reimbursed Southern Pacific- for the properties and Associated Oil stock turned over . This amount was- probably handed to the company toward the end of the quarter , thus making possible the appearance of a considerable cash item in the first balance sheet .
