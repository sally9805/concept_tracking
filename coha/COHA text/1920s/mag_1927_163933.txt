Liberal President Juan Sacasa of Nicaragua ( recognized by Mexico ) protested loudly , last week , the assertions of President Coolidge and Secretary Kellogg that he is receiving arms from Mexico ( see p. 6 ) . He declared that his soldiers are equipped with U. S. Army pattern Enfield rifles purchased in Manhattan and transshipped across the U. S. and Mexico to Nicaragua . <P> Meanwhile Rear Admiral Julian Latimer , his 15 U. S. war craft , and his 4,680 U. S. marines were policing Nicaragua in such a manner that President Adolfo Diz ( recognized by the U. S. ) was safe in his capital , Managua , while President Sacasa was being starved out for want of supplies on the West Coast . President Diaz , presumably advised by Admiral Latimer , cabled a long peace plea to the U. S. public , proposing that his regime be maintained until 1928 , and that an election then be held under U. S. supervision .                    @
