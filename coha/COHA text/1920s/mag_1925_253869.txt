The blatant ballyhoo for the trial , next month , at Dayton , Tenn. , of Teacher John Thomas Scopes , indicted by a grand jury under Tennessee 's anti-evolution law ( TIME , May 18 ) , continued to occupy an exaggerated amount of space in the newspapers . Actual developments were few . <P> In Dayton , Judge J. L. Godsey , counsel for the defense , entered a motion in the Circuit Court to quash the indictment on the grounds 1 ) that the act under which it was brought violates the Constitution of Tennessee in its guarantee of religious freedom and 2 ) that the indictment itself is " vague " and violates the U. S. Constitution in its guarantee of information to one accused , as to the nature of his crime and its guarantee of free speech . <P> In Manhattan , Teacher Scopes was rushed about , nervous and bewildered , to conferences where lawyers who were allegedly interested solely in seeing justice done squabbled amongst themselves as to who should be chosen and in what order they should rank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Great Cause . In the minds of one group of the Scopes advisors , this Cause was the dignified one of abstract academic freedom . This group wanted Lawyer Charles E. Hughes to lend distinction to the case . Others were for " jazzing " the case , splashing it in even larger type through ' the headlines of newspapers , thoroughly airing and " teaching the people " the theory of evolution . These men wanted Lawyers Clarence Darrow and Dudley Field Malone for popular appeal , Lawyer Bainbridge Colby for a modicum of distinction . Hardly consulting the defendant himself , the latter group won , after mollifying Lawyer Malone with assurances that he would get as much publicity out of the trial as any one , that his Irish Catholicism and the fact that he has been divorced were not viewed as undesirable qualities in him . <P> Then there was a banquet , at which Teacher Scopes stammered a few embarrassed words and the important lawyers indulged in brilliant jocularities . Scopes left for Dayton , leaving his friends to allege that he had refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , as most celebrities long to be , to a Ziegfeld Follies audience by Cowboy Comedian Will Rogers . <P> Lawyers Darrow , Malone and Colby called at the Museum of Natural History to confer with Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn and to be shown by him the complete paleontological evidence of Evolution . With this evidence , the barristers declared themselves " satisfied . " <P> In Chicago , it was announced that A Civic Biology , one of the text books containing an unBiblical account of the creation for the use of which Teacher Scopes was arrested to test the Tennessee law , had been placed on the reading list of that city 's high and junior high schools . <P> In England , George Bernard Shaw , in the course of a debate with Hilaire Belloc , described William Jennings Bryan , leader of the prosecution in the Scopes case , as " a man with an extraordinary uplift and no discoverable brains of any kind .
