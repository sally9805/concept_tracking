txt Samuel Montagu &; Co. , one of London 's greatest international banking houses , in their weekly letter make the following criticism of the German situation : Liermany has scored all the way . She started to befool the " auslander " even before the armistice was signed . In the early part of 191b she commenced to buy Bank of England notes and U. S. dollar notes in Holland , Switzerland and Sweden . Bank of England notes to a large amount were bought by these neutral countries , which were able to sell them at astonishing premiums against marks ( when the exchange was about M. 27 to the ? ) , and since then Germany has exported milliards and milliards of her paper money in exchange for huge amounts of raw materials , and other commodities and foreign currencies . Her nationals have the commodities and the foreign currencies ; the foreigner has the paper and at last he is : fired of the game . Further , the German Reich has vastly reduced its debt by watering the mark and sterling value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 205 milliards ) has been reduced to : 223 ; s-410,000 against which the State Bank holds 1,004.858,000 gold marks . These at the present market price are worth ? 54,000,000  --  a surplus reserve of ** its note liability . France suffered far more material damage . She had her factories destroyed , machinery smashed and her mines flooded , and could have adopted the same policy with her currency as Germany had she so willed , but cn the contrary she is ever striving to deflate her circulation and to reduce her indebtedness to the Bank of France . The sterling-equivalent of her 36 milliards of bank notes at today 's exchange is nearly ? 626,000,000 against a reserve of 3,582,713,000 gold francs , representing at today 's price ? 154,000,000 . The German government now pleads that on account of the depreciation of the mark it can not discharge its Treaty " Obligations , foreign exchange being unobtainable . We refuse to dissociate the Reich from its constituent parts , its nationals , who possess ample resources abroad arising from their sales of marks , and from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the export of German floating capital , which is safely lodged in sanctuary abroad and to talk now of taking steps to stop its export is too late in the day . What steps did the German government take in 1916 or since , although it has been common ic-nowledge what was going on ? Did it institute a censorship as was done in England to arrest any outflow and to inflict severe penalties on those who transgressed ? If England and France could take effective measures it was open for German to act in like manner . Even now a strong government could take measures by which its nationals would be cornoelled to declare their holdings abroad and to pay their taxes in foreign currencies ' ( of course at the exchange current when they were due ) . At this juncture when negotiations are in progress between our delegates and the German government , we reproduce an extract from a speech by our premier delivered early this month , in which he said : " Germany ( by the fall of the mark ) has wiped out practically her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a well-equipped Germany with ( 10.000,000 of people with no internal debt , with an external debt which was fixed at a time when things were pretty bad , and an England with a debt of ? 7,000.000,000 and an external debt of ? 1,000,000.000 entering into competition with the two great powers which are her rivals industrially.
