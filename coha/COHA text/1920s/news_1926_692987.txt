txt State Senator Alexander Simpson announced yesterday that important evidence in the Hall-Mills case , which had been in the hands of the authorities , had disappeared but that enough remained to obtain the indictment of a woman and at least two men . perhaps three , in connecting with the slaying of the Rev. Dr. Edward W. Hall and Mrs. Eleanor R. Mills four years ago on the outskirts of New Brunswick , N. J. He made this statement after he , had gone to Somerville , N. J. , where he conferred with Somerset County Prosecutor Francis L. Bergen . Acting in advance of his formal appointment as Special Deputy Attorney General , superseding Bergen in the revived in- I quiry into the case , the Senator interviewed Mrs. Jane Gibson , the " pig woman . " She has been regarded as the star witness against Mrs. Hall , 1 now at liberty in 515,1k10 bail on the charge that she killed her husband and his choir leader . Senator Simpson said he was " much impressed " by Mrs. Gibson 's story . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders and saw a weeping woman in gray kneeling beside the body of : the rector and a " bushy-haired " man standing by . Her narrative of what she saw on the night of Sept. 14. 1922 , on lonely Phillips farm was rejected by the Grand Jury , which heard the evidence against Mrs. Hall four years ago and refused to vote an indictment . Willie Stevens 's Pistol Missing . " While we have enough evidence upon which to obtain the indictments , " said Senator Simpson at Somerville , " 1 am horrified to learn that much of the important evidence is missing . Among it is the pistol of Willie Stevens . This , I am told , was returned to him after it had been kept for some time in the safe of the Warden of the Somerset County Jail . " There are also many important statements by witnesses which were also in the Warden 's safe that are missing . Strange to say , however , the one document which was carefully preserved was an affidavit by one of the witnesses u-ho attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns the positive identification of two persons , and I am confident that any Grand Jury will indict . I can not , of course , disclose the precise nature of this evidence at the present time . " Among the statements which are I missing from the Warden 's safe are those by persons who were under suspicion during the last investigation . One of my first steps will be to learn how these disappeared and who is responsible for their disappearance . " The pistol owned by Willie Stevens n-as an important link in the chain of evidence . I regard its return to its owner as amazing . It was in the Warden 's safe , and at this time I do not knew the circumstances of its return . I think that such details will have an important bearing on the case . " Avoids Comment on Mrs. Hall . " Do you believe that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the arrest of Mrs. Hall ? " he was asked . " I decline to answer that one , " he said . " Since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictments , is there to be another arrest in the near future ? " " It is sometimes wise to leave people at large even when they are under suspicion . " he replied . " I am going to read over all of the available testimony in the case to see if the State has a prima facie case . It is probable that the only witness 1 will call in the near future will be Hrs . Gibson . If I find there is not enough evidence to make a case I will interview all the witnesses . " The Special Deputy Attorney General 's blunt disclosure that vital evidence in the case had " disappeared " confirmed reports current in Somerville and New Brunswick that signed statements of witnesses and even a certified copy of the minutes of the Grand Jury had been " lost " in transit from one county office to another . These reports placed the missing documents as in the hands of persons outside of the case . James P. Major , Warden of the jail , was asked if he could explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He referred all questions on that score to Prosecutor Bergen , who maintained his attitude of consistently refusing to affirm or deny that evidence was gone . Starts Action Suddenly . The special prosecutor made up his mind to start action on the case suddenly . He had waited all day in his office in Jersey City for word that Supreme Court Justice Charles W. Parker , who was in charge of the previous Grand Jury , had signed the papers requisite to his appointment . It developed late in the afternoon that Justice Parker had mailed the signed authorization from Northeast Harbor , Me. , to Attorney General Edward Katzeneach 's office in Trenton . The pee Per hid net reached Trenton Iate last night . Anxious to start his work and realizing that the arrival of the paper was a mere formality , Senator Simpson telephoned , to the Attorney General at Leonard 's Farm , Brandon , Vt . Mr. Katzenbach indicated his willingness for the Senator to dispense with formality and get down to work . Ten minutes later Senator Simpson was on his way by motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went immediately to the office of Prosecutor Bergen in the Somerville Tru , st Company Building in Main Street . He entered the Prosecutor 's office with a small army of reporters at his heels . Bergen was seated at his desk . " Mr. Bergen ? " said the Senator . ' Yes ? I 'm Simpson , " he added , and they shook hands . " I received a telephone call from the Attorney General , " continued Senator Simpson , " and I am here to , discuss the situation . " Bergen looked hesitatingly at ' the newspaper delegation . " Shall we discuss it now or ? " and he waved his hand toward the visitors , who withdrew . Calls at Mrs. Gibson 's Home . The two men remained in conference for thirty minutes . When Senator Simpson came out he issued his oral statement .. He then motored to home of Mrs. Gibson , a ramblEg structure in Middlebush , just outside the city limits of New Brunswick . Newspaper men on post there had advised Mrs. Gibson of the advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senator followed by five other automobiles caused Mrs. Gibson , who was feeding her pigs at the time , to race to the door and bolt it . She was persuaded te open It and Senator Simpson talked fo her for about thirty minutes , When he came out , he said : " I am going to report to Governor Moore tomorrow that there is ample evidence for the indictments for first degree murder . Mrs. Gibson talked in detail about the entire incident . Her explanations and description of the quarrel and of hearing voices positively identified one person . She saw , two men and a woman , and perhaps a third man . She Is not positive of the third man . She heard one of the women remark , ' Oh , Henry , why did you do that ? ' Convinced Mrs. Gibson Tells Truth . " I am absolutely convinced that Jane Gibson tells a truthful story , and I shall report to the Governor that she is not the type of person who , through sheer imagination , could invent any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the murder . She tells me the story of recognizing the woman and two of the men . She gives a valid reason ler-being out at that time of night  --  and I thoroughly believe and shall so report to the Governor that her story is absolutely right and will stand up under cross-examination . " The Senator was asked if Mrs. Gibson had given the name of the woman in gray whom she identified . He said that she had , but that he would not disclose it . " The thing that surprises me , " he continued , " is the way the evidence in the case has disappeared . There are nowhere near the number of &cu.; mehts in that . safe ' now that were there when the late Prosecutor Azariah Beekman ended the first investigation . In addition to the pistol , the autopsy report is missing . This is an important point in the case . " Another thing is this : I found that the nose glasses which were found on the nose of Dr. Hall had , been wiped clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another thing I have discovered is that private detectives for the defense visited State 's witnesses in the first investigation and that stories were changed later . " A case in point is that of William Phillips , the night watchman who was arrested almost at once in this investigation . Phillips was badgered by private detectives and was even threatened with perjury proceedings if he did not change Ws story . That sort of thing is going to be looked into . " I shall apponit Patrick Hayes , formerly Chief of the Hoboken . Police Department and now chief investigator for Prosecutor John ' Milton of Hudson County , as my chief of staff in the morning . I plan to go over all the evidence with him . " On Wednesday at 4 P. M. I shall confer with Prosecutor Bergen and with Major Mark 0 , Kimberling , assigned to direct the work of the State Troopers on the case . The conference , marking the aktual launching of the field work of the investigation , will take place at Somerville . " The Senator said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though she should waive her rights to immunity . During the first Grand Jury proceeding Mrs. Hall made vain efforts to appear before the Grand Jurors , offering to surrender any or all of her rights for the privilege of telling her version of the events of the case before the investigating body . Touches on Fingerprint Angle . Another thing the Senator said that he had scheduled for early inquiry was an effort to ascertain why Lieut . Henry Schwarz , fingerprint expert from the Newark Police Department , was told that his services were not wanted . Lieut . Schwarz was hired by the prosecution early in the investigation and when he reported was turned back to Essex County . " I understand , " said the Senatqr , reverting to the missing evidence Again , ' that the firing pin on ' Willie ' Stevens 's pistol had been filed for purposes of identification . I never heard of anything like that being done before . " The filing of the pin , evidently unknown to the Senator , was developed early in the investigation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes of identification . The pin was filed down by Dr. Hall himself two weeks before the crime . No explanation of why the clergyman had seen fit to take this precaution was ever forthcoming . The weapon , a .38-aclibre Iver Johnson revolver , rather than an automatic pistol , had been hanging from its trigger guard from a hook on the back of a ddor in the Hall home for several years . Pistol Was Never Traced . The shooting of Dr. Hall and Mrs. Mills , as shown berthells found beside the bodies , by the bullet wounds ) and . by two bullets found imbedded in Mrs. Mills 's skull , was done by an automatic pistol of .32 calibre . This weapon was never traced , nor was the keenedged knife with which one of the slayers nearly severed the choir leader 's head . The Senator 's disclosure of Mrs. Gibson 's story to him indicated that she had amplified the version she repeated three times to the authorities and later told to the Grand Jury . In her earlier narratives she mentioned seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . ' After the special prosecutor had told the new account , however , it.developed that the . ' . ' pig woman " had reduced her neiv. vet-slog VI a sworn statement . months ago . Some Months ' aete ? the investigation had apparently closed in ' Somerville and New , Brunswick Gibson ' vleited the Prosecutor 's office in ' Somerville and had along talk  --  With Mr. Beekman ; who has- since died . ? ' ' Mr. Beekman questioned- her minutely and leaded from her a number of things which she had not told before . The presectitor was unable at that time to check het revised story to his satisfaction , but had her dictate it to ' a court stenographer . He divulged the contents of the newstatement to no one , and when he waz unable fo corroborate it in all its details he sealed it and filed it away for the use Of the Attorney . General in the event that the investigation was reopened . It is this statement , or parts , of it , upon which the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Bright Praises Simpson . ? Upon the . return of - Senator Simpson to his office . in Jersey City he found a letter awaittrg him . It was from State Senator Willlam H. Bright , Republican ' Representative from Cape May , , who was formerly President of the , New Jersey'Senate. /ri it Senator Bright . wrote , : " I am happy at the thought that there is one min whom the money of the , upper ten can not buy . It has been such a rotten mess that it fairly reeks with filth ; the air at that time and since . has been filled with ugly rumors about people who have been touched with the magic wand of money . ? Its ramifications penetrated every walk of life and if you can nail the culprit and fasten the crime you will create respect . for law much needee at this time . " In line with Senator Simpson 's charge that-evidence had been hpirited away , Captain John J. Lamp of the ? State Troopers , assigned to the case , asked George Washkowich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call at the - troopers ' headquarters in Somerville . Washkowich was one of the newspaper men assigned to cover the Hall-Mills case four years ago . Among First at Scene of Crime . He was one of the first reporters to get to the crabapple tree beneath which the rector andnfrs : Mills were found , carefully laid out . Washkowich , ranging over the ground , picked'up a handkerchief , which later was counted as a strong item of evidence in the case against Mrs. ? Frances Noel Stevens Hall . The bit of cambric had a single initial " Pi " in the corner . When the reporter arrived at the headquarters he was closeted with Lamb for fifteen minutes . When he came out , he said that Lamb had reported that the handkerchief had vanished with the other links in the State 's original case . During the day Captain Lambguestioned four other witnesses . Ire re'fused to reveal their identity or to Indicate in any witty the nature of their evidence . Two of the witnesses were , observed going into Lamb 's office in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ipan and a woman : Later a girl , apparently about 17 years old , I was questioned . The fourth witness came and- went unobserved . The man and the woman arrived in a Ford se- I clan . and when they left a State Trooper accompanied them . ' Shortly after they left Senator Simp-1 son arrived and made his charges . Prosecutor Bergen refused to comment when he was asked concerning the matter , but over in New Brunswick , Prosecutor John E. Toolan , of Middlesex County , who was an assistant prosecutor during the inquiry four years ' ago , spoke out . Mr. Toolan was asked if he had read of Senator Simpson 's intention to expand his investigation to include the handling of the first investigation in the belief that " undue influences " might have impeded the authorities in their work . Hopes Be Cleared Up . " Yes , I always read the newspapers , " said the Prosecutor , " and here 's what I have to say : I hole that somebody will ultimately investigate everything to the entire satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directly and by inference , not only of the murderer or murderers , but ' of everybody concerned with the case . " What we all should have is a clean bill of health , and I expect that we 'll get it from ' this investigation . For myself , I 'm willing to assist the prosecution of all the guilty , if any , including myself , if necessary . I have no intention of participating in the new investigation , since it is outside my county , but any information that I may have is , naturally , at the disposal of Senator Simpson . The investigation itself is none of my business . " e7 . ? ? Phillips Freed on Bail . William Phillips , reformed burglar and later a night watchman , obtained his release yesterday from the Somerville jail . He was arrested at 7:30 P. M. last Thursday at his home , 72 Dennis Street , New Brunswick , and held as a material witness in the slaying . His bail was fixed at e5,000 , but on Saturday his attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced : o The order releasing Phillips was signed by W. R. Sutphen , Justice of the Peace . The bail bond was furnished by Frederick E. Koechlein , who owns the house in-which Phillips lives . Phillips story , should it be substantiated , would be of prime importance to the State . He swore he saw Mrs. Hall enter her home at 2:10 4 .. M. the morning after the murder . Mrs. Gibson had sworn that the woman she saw at the murder scene wore a " gray coat . " Phillips testified that Mrs. Hall was wearing a light-colored polo coat . Mrs. Hall denied Phillips 's time element , saying that she came home at e:39 A. M. , after an abseil/le of only fifteen minutes spent with " Willie " Stevens , her ' brother , in a visit to the Church of St. John the Evangelist , searching for her missing nusband . Phillips went by trolley to his home upon his release . He was in a truculent mood when he reached the house and staged a fist fight with a photographer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then led him into the small apartment . " Why do n't you go to the right people ? " she said . " We do n't know anything about that murder . What do you want to bother us for ? " " I ca n't talk for publication , " said Phillips , as he entered the apartment . Mills Reiterates His Hopes . James Mills , husband ? Of the murdered woman , was found in his humble home in Carman Street , about two blocks from the churca where he formerly was sexton and a block from his present job as janitor of the Lord Stirling High School . " My attitude in regard to the prosecution of those guilty of this crime , " Ire said , " has not changed . a whit in four years . I am still anxious to have the whole thing cleared up ' . The first investigation was a , sample of the worst bungling I ever saw . I have every confidence in Mrs. Gibson 's story . The night before she went to the authorities With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw a certain woman at the scene . I have never had any reason to disbelieve her . " To the best of my knowledge Mr. ? and here Mills named a man who was mentioned early in the easel has metier teett , qiiestioned . " His alibi lever looked good to me . " The presents of money was brought to bear four years ago . I have often lain awake nights thinking , over , who did these murders , and I have always bad one . definite man in mind . Yes ; I do not think dt was , a woman who did the killing . I think , andel have always thought , that it ' was- a man . I wish the whole ' thing would be cleared up , /go that there would be ' ari end to the prosecution of - innocent persons . " , Mills verified a section of the exam ' ination of his daughter , Charlotte Mills , at the hapds of  --  Prosecutor Beekman , and County Detectives Ferd A. David of ' New Brunswick and George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' published yesterday in question ' and answer form , the girl , now 19 I years old , reiterated time and again her Conviction that money and- political influence had been brought to bear in the case . Girl Advised to " Keep Quiet . " ? In closing the examination , according to the story verified by Mr. Mills , Charlotte was advised by the late Prosecutor as follows : ' " We ' want you to get that out of your head the thought that influ- ' ences were at work ' as We are just as anxious as you are to find out who killed your mother . My advice to you is to keep quiet , but : of course you cad do as ' you choose as we do not intend to annoy you any more than you-have to be , and what you say and refuse tie say will be misconstrued in all probability and twisted around to mean what you did not mean yourself . " James Russell , husband of Nellie Russell , the negress who gave information to the State police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hall was at the scene of the murder , declared that the State police had been secretly endeavoring to terrify his wife into retracting het stories . ? " They have decided that Mrs. Hall is. guilty and they do n't want any one to show up Mrs. Gibson - because she is a witness against Mrs. Hall . They want to have ' you believe anything Mr. ; Gibson says , " he asserted . Russell said that last night just after dark Captain Lamb , - accompanied by Corporal Joseph Hanlon and two other detectives , called at his home and tried to get his wife to " retract-everything , including what she knew abouteRobert Erling and his seeing Mrs. Gibson on her mule at 8 o'clock the night of the murder . " ? He said he had told his wife to say nothing unless she was ' arrested , and that he " got down my old rifle and told them I 'd shoot if they did n't get off the place . " The detectives then left , he said . Troopers Question Erling . Erling was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somerville . Reporters who approached him when he was brought back to the factory where he works ? the Lyons Peace Dye Works at Lincoln Gardens  --  found him trembling and unwilling to talk . He would not confirm or deny the truth of what Mrs. Russell ; had reported him as saying , but . Mrs. Mary Gutman , ' with whom he boards , said . that she had heard him tell of ' finding bloody leaves in De Russey 's Lane , where the murder was committed , and having seen Mrs. Gibson near the spot at 8 o'clock . Mrs. Russell , in announcing she had found ? another witness , said that a woman in -a Manhattan employment agency had told . ' her about seeing blood-stained leaves neab the scene on the night of the murder . An investigation in twelve employm'ent agencies on Sixth Avenue from Thirty-sixth to Fortieth Street - yesterday failed to disctose any information regarding Mrs. Russell or her witness .
