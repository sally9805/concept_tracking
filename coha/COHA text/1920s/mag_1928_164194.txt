The outstanding feature of the opening address of Governor-General Henry L. Stimson to the Philippine Legislature , published last week by the U. S. War Department , was a long quotation from a survey-report of the Islands by Vice President Lyman P. Hammond of the Electric Bond &; Share Co. ( part of the so-called U. S. " Power Trust " ) . The Stimson-Hammond point : Let the Filipinos revise their land and corporation laws so as to permit the introduction of U. S. capital and management . Contrary to custom , even the brashest U. S. liberals were slow to cry " Wall Street " on this occasion . Reason : Statesman Stimson adroitly emphasized the truism that political independence which Filipinos so crave is nowadays synonymous with economic independence . <P> Leader Sergio Osmena of the Philippine Senate , long an agitator for Island independence and an old-time opponent of " foreign " capital in the Philippines , applauded the Stimson document ; said that the law changes suggested should not be difficult to effect . This was good news to such outreaching U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless Surveyor Hammond 's Electric Bond &; Share Co.
