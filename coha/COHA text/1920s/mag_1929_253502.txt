In Manhattan , last week , a long-simmering Bankruptcy Scandal boiled over . Charges of nepotism , favoritism in awarding receiverships , intimidation of witnesses , were made in Congress against U.S. District Judge Francis Asbury Winslow . Congressman La Guardia of New York called for the kind of investigation , by the House Judiciary Committee , that generally precedes impeachment . Countering , Judge Winslow said it was all " a diabolical plot . " The chief citation against him was that he had suspended sentence on a ' ' crooked bust ' ' named Meyer Kaplan in return for an " understanding " which , when subsequently not fulfilled , caused Buster Kaplan to be jailed for the full sentence . <P> Bankruptcies became front-page news in New York early in January when an attorney named David Steinhart , receiver and Republican politician , fled , leaving bankruptcy books $50,000 short . Judge Winslow had sponsored his appointment many times . Steinhart was indicted . Officials chased him ; disguised in red whiskers , through Canada . Charles Shongood , U. S. auctioneer , was removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Federal judges in Manhattan switched bankruptcy cases from personal receivers to the American Exchange Irving Trust Co . A grand jury gathered more evidence . <P> As President of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York , Charles Evans Hughes named a special committee to scrutinize bankruptcy law administration , " a matter of very grave concern . " <P> Bankruptcy . A business man possesses $50,000 . He owes $200,000 . He goes , or is thrown , into bankruptcy . A U. S. court takes over his $50,000 assets , turns them into cash at auction , equitably distributes the proceedings among the bankrupt 's creditors in extinguishment of all claims , at the rate of 25 ( less court costs ) on the dollar . He is discharged free of debt , but with his credit badly blotted . <P> Bankruptcies are of two kinds . <P> 1 ) Straight Bust : A business man , through bad commercial judgment or bad markets , overstrains his credit , owes more than he can pay , gives up all assets to the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Crooked Bust : A business man deliberately uses his credit to obtain excessive loans or merchandise , conceals his assets from the court , defrauds his creditors . <P> Only a thin line of intention divides the two classes . The Crooked Bust is a criminal offense . <P> The Court . Bankruptcy cases strain the integrity of the best U. S. courts . Countless dollars are held in trust by the court , countless assistants are named to administer them . The judicial machinery is cumbersome and complex , understood only by legal experts . Large are the potentialities for graft and corruption . <P> In theory the court guards the bankrupt 's assets , with all the moral rigor of the U. S. behind it . In practice the judge appoints a supposedly disinterested and trustworthy person as receiver who does the actual work , subject only to final court review . The Federal law fixes the service charges a receiver may make upon the assets , ranging from 6% on $500 or less , down to 1% on $10,000 or more .
