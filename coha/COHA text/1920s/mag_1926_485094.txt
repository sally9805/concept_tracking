rill-1E FAILURE OF THE JURY to convict the ex . ' . Attorney General , Harry M. Daugherty , and the Alien Property Custodian , Thomas W. Miller , is not as disheartening as it appears . It was an extremely difficult case because , the statute of limitations having run , these men could not be tried on the direct charge of bribery , but only on the charge of having conspired to accept bribes . That rendered the task of the prosecuting officer extremely difficult and this particular jury could not be convinced . We sincerely hope that the District Attorney , Emory R. Buckner , will not be deterred from moving for an early retrial . If so , we trust he will this time follow the suggestions made from time to time in these columns as set forth in the article by Mr. Mels elsewhere in this issue . No stone . must be left unturned to bring these men to justice , or to establish their innocence . They should be eager for a retrial . If the case is dropped now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one kind of justice for men who can pay their lawyers $50,000 or $60,000 and another for the poor men who fall into the clutches of the law . It is , admitted that Daugherty destrOyed bank records to cover up his actions and that some of Merton 's Liberty bonds passed to Mr. Miller 's account . Shall people say that Republican politics prevented the bringing out of the truth and convicting these men ? O NE OF MUSSOLINI 'S COLLEAGUES , after denying assorted reports that Mussolini was about to undergo an operation and to declare war on Turkey , that the chief of the Fascisti had resigned and that Italy was buying up Portuguese colonies cheap , continued I am just about tired of denying reports such as these . If things continue in this way I shall have to establish a special office for denying falsehoods . His Excellency might find it cheaper to let the opposition press and the foreign correspondents function freely . As it is , with the responsible unfriendly press suppressed no one takes any denial at face value and any hostile rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth believed he must set the unfriendly truth free too . Censorship of a nation 's news is an admission ' of weakness and an invitation to liars . R USSIA in these days is not so much censoring the news as trying to censor the production of news . The statement of the opposition leaders within the Communist Party , repudiating their manner of opposition , is an extraordinary document . We disagreed with the majority of the Central Committee it said on a number of principal problems . These views we still retain . But we categorically repudiate the theory and practice of the freedom of forming groups and fractions . . . . We declare that we definitely give up fractional methods of defense of our views because of the danger of such methods for the unity of the party . Here is the doctrine of party discipline frank and unlovely . These men have fought for principles in which they still believe but , for the sake of party unity , they renounce the struggle . They would make of the party an inhuman super- , machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of crisis such a doctrine can be understood ; in the long run it can only lead to a deadening uniformity . As a matter of fact these men deny their own interpretation of history . Their opposition is not born out of their own heads ; it grew out of the changing social structure of the soviet state , and the same economic forces which have thrust them into opposition in the past ( as Louis Fischer will show in an early issue of The Nation ) will throw them or others into a new workers ' opposition in the future . Economics and personality have thrown Stalin and Trotzky into conflict before , and will again . Lenin foresaw their personal incompatibility with uncanny accuracy . Max Eastman has just revealed Lenin 's long-concealed " testament . " Trotzky , he said , was " the most able man " in the Central Committee , but suffered by his " too far-reaching self-confidence " and absorption in administration . Stalin , he thought , suffered from " administrative impulsiveness , " lacked patience , and was too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trotzky 's second revolt has failed in its first attack . But permanent peace can not be built upon the cornerstone of bureaucratic autocracy .
