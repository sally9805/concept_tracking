A week ago the China sky was full of ugly black clouds : Dr. Sun Yat-Sen was reported to be on his way to Canton by way of Hong Kong . Would the British let him pass ? It was doubtful . <P> Since Sun 's arrival in Hong Kong , however , he and the British have been indulging in an orgy of compliments . <P> Dr. Sun strongly advised the Chinese to learn the English language and to imitate the example of good government in all China . <P> The British , on their part , have been feting Sun as China 's long-lost savior.
