txt Ratings for Physicians . A day or so ago there was an account in TEM TIMES of a ten-year-old boy who endured for four days the pain of a bullet in his abdomen because he feared punishment for playing with a forbidden rifle . According to the report , the child complained of a stomach ache , and a doctor diagnosed it us jaundice . The parents discovered the bullet hole in the boy 's abdomen , but the child died . Why was the doctor 's name not mentioned in tho news report ? if there is no way for calling a bungling practitioner to account . surely the public should be told his name . It would then be possible to avoid him when medical aid is needed by some other unfortunate . I am not attempting to imply that doctors should not malte mistakes . They - are human and , Into the rest of us , are bound to slip new and then . 1 do . however . believe that the public should be told of their mistakes so that their records may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be established somewnat along the lines of the commercial and financial bureaus referred to by business men when they desire to get a line on a firm or an individual . A standard should Ire set and a doctor rated according to his shill and ability . His financial success may or may not be a worth-while index . Competent physicians would doubtless welcome a weeding-out plan . EDWARD F. CHAIIIDLER . Brooklyn . Sept. 3 , 11127.
