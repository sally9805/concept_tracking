txt By a vote of 57 to 25 the House today amended the Immigration bill to prohibit immigration for one year instead of two years , and adopted a nuruber of minor changes . This was accomplished after a sharp debate , with Representative James R. Mann of Illinois and Representative Joseph Walsh of Massachusetts demanding that the legislation should be enacted for temporary purposes only and not as a permanent barrier against those seeking liberty in the United States . The attitude , of these Republicans influenced the House to accept their views and forecasts the passage of the bill tomorrow without any other important changes . The bill as amended is declared to be more acceptable to the Senate , where long hearings will be held by the Immigration Committee . The disposition in the Senate is favorable to prohibition , but the leaders believe that this should come through a board.swhich would have authority to restrict or prohibit as conditions might justify . When the House adjourned discussion on an amendment presented by Representative Henry T. Rainey of Illinois was in progress . This exempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter agricultural pursuits . " This bill , " said Mr. Rainey , " is presented largely at the demand of organized labor in order to keep up the present standard of wages . But organized labor refuses to enter the field of farm labor . Unless the farmers can get cheaper labor you will find that they will only , be able to till a small part of their farms with their wives and children and produce little more than enough food for themselves . The farmers need help and farm immigrants should not be excluded . " Knutson Fears Horde of Radicals . Representative Harold Knutson of Minnesota , Republican , who supported the measure , said that " foreign Governments are financing the movement of radicals to the United States . " When his statement was challenged he said that this assertion was ' based upon his observation and inspection of immigrants arriving in New York . " My parents came to this country as immigrants , " said Mr. Knutson , " and in the very nature of things I would be inclined to oppose any proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the period of two pears , were it not for the fact that I realize the imperative necessity for some legislation along this line . " Immigrants are coming in now at a rate where we can not sift them out , and the worst part . of it is that the class of People we are receiving now are largely radical in their political opinions . I am willing to stake my reputation as a member of this House that foreign Governments are financing the movement of radicals from several countries in Europe , moving them over here . Before the war immigration from Spain was practically unknown . Two weeks ago , when I visited Ellis Island , I found 2,000 immigrants from that country were received in one dale Spain is a seething mass of anarchy , and the Government is gathering these anarchists up and dumping them on us . " How long are we going to stand for it ? We can not allow the Governments of Europe to dump their , Bolsheviks and Communists on . us . We have no place for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with . We ought to deport those we have . " Representative Mann occupied the floor at different times , but before amendments were considered he declared his opposition to the general provisions of the bill and served notice that he would demand that the period of exclusion be reduced to at least one year . Amendments offered by Representative Siegel of New York to fix the period of exclusion at six months , and another by Representative Blanton to extend it to twenty-six months , were lost . The House compromised on Mr. Mann 's amendment , which fixes the period at fourteen months instead of two years . This is actually one year , as the act does not become effective until sixty days after passage . Says Irish Would Be Turned Over to British . " If I understand this bill correctly , it would apply to a case like this , " said Mr. Mann . " There exists today in Ireland a very deplorable condition , as every one will admit . What is going to be done there I do not know , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more drastic methods than it has up to the present time . That condition might exist in any other country in the world . Under the terms of this bill , as I understand them . if an Irishman seeks to escape in the end from the drastic measures adopted by the British Government and succeeds in getting a vessel which will carry him from his own shores and lands him ? in America , he will be returned by us to the British Government to be tried and convicted of treason perhaps , and perhaps to be hanged . " I will not vote for any bill or law which proposes that a liberty loving citizen anywhere in the world , ? attempting a revolution at home to secure what he believes is his liberty and his right , driven from his shores and landing on ours , shall be turned over by our Government to another Government to be hanged . " The same situation may arise in Mexico . It is said that the Guatemalan Government has a man in confinement who was formerly President of that Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would be compelled to return him to his Government for punishment . I doubt whether the time has conic when liberty loving America should say ' We will not permit under ? ny conditions the entrance into the United States of people from abroad who are being persecuted or prosecuted , as you please , because they are attempt ? ing to obtain freedom at home . ' " How far we ought to go in restricting immigration I do not undertake to say . For many years I voted against immigration bills in the House , but finally voted fdr the last one because we were told under the terms of that bill our Government would be able after the war to keep out the horde of migrants that might seek our shores . Whether it is because of lack of en . forcemeat of the law that this is not done I dp not undertake to say . I have no doubt that everywhere people are looking to the United States as the land of liberty and safety . I am not willing to say that if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution we shall say , ' You can not enter our doors . ' "
