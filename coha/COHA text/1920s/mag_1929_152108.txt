People have sailed , swum , flown , rowed , fought , argued their way across the English Channel ( 21 miles ) . If and when the much-bruited Channel tunnel ( TIME , April 8 ) is built , people will be able to train-ride across or even walk . But only two men have ever pedalled across the Channel . Hydrocyclist Rene Savard , in 1927 , crossed in 7 hrs. 13 min. and last week Raoul Vincent , pumping patiently at the pedals that made his paddles go , got across in " record " time : 5 hrs. 35 min.
