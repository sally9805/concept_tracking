On the day before adjournment , a Democrat , Representative Edward W Pou of North Carolina , sounded the name of Nicholas Longworth , said : A great many of us feel that our old enemy , the Republican Party , might do itself proud if in time it shall put him Mr Longworth forth as a candidate for the greatest office in the gift the American people and the entire world . He has been tried in the political fire . He stands forth today without a mark against his fair name . He stands forth as a rugged , typical American . We all on our side and on both sides wish him well . He presides over an American home . About his hearthstone is gathered rugged graceful refined , intellectual womanhood and innocent and guileless childhood , lofty integrity and robust manhood .
