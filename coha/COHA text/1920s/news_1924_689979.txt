txt That the railroads earned only 5.12 per cent . on an assumed property valuation in 1923 , whereas the Commerce Commission has declared 5.75 per cent . a fair return , is no calamity , even though the year was one of record-breaking tonnage and the valuation used is clearly too low . Champions of the railroads do them no service when they overstress the lack of a fair return and ignore the great climb up from bankruptcy the carriers have been allowed , and even assisted to make , since the prostration of 1920 . Primarily that recovery was due to the efforts of railroad management , as it should have been , but the conditions that made it possible were those created by the Transportation Act and its fairly intelligent administration . The difference between the actual return last year and the standard set up by the Commission means far less than the difference between last year 's return and the 4.14 per cent . earned in 1922 . When the 1923 net operating earnings of $977,657,000 are contrasted with $776 , - 880,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of the carriers to realize last year the lull measure of an arbitrarily determined " fair return " becomes relatively insignificant . To say that net operating income of 1923 was the largest since 1916 and , with the exception of that year , the largest in amount the carriers ever obtained is , of course , to tell a half truth of which the other half is , that since 1916 carriers have invested upwards of $3,800 , - 000,000 in road and equipment . If last year 's results had been proportionately as good as those of 1916 , net would have been $228,000,000 greater instead of $81,000,000 less than in that year . But the war , or our participation in it , lies between those years . The railroads were not the only industry to feel its damaging effects . What last year 's figures mean is that restoration of railroad earning power has been largely accomplished and can he completed within the next year or two , barring political interference with the sane and orderly adjustment of rates decreed by the Transportation Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the statutory fair return , will absorb a smaller proportion of the revenue dollar than the-did before the war . That proportion was generally falling before 1917 or 1914 and presumably will fall again in the future , following the sound principle of a narrowing profit margin on an expanding volume of business . What the country needs-most to keep in mind is that reasonably profitable and amply financed railroads alone can render cheap and efficient transportation service , and that inefficient or insufficient service is not cheap at any price . Every business man and nearly every farmer knows that the past year 's smooth handling of an unprecedented volume of business was an undisguised blessing to the country . That performance was made possible by the degree of financial recovery the railroads have enjoyed since the end of federal control . The country can have the transportation it needs at reasonable rates if , and only if , it allows such recovery to proceed .
