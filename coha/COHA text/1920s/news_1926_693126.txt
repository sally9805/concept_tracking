If the State and the Federal Government are to stick their noses into the coyote business , Harney thinks that some less magical trapper should be employed . In sixty days of 1924 " Bu.L " trapped 300 coyotes . Is this fair to them . or to Harney ? Why does n't the Government protect instead of trying to destroy this home industry of the homesteaders ?

" More than half a century after the formation of the Savoyard partnership it is safe to assert that GILBERT and SULLIVAN never will be missed , for the reason that they never will be missing . A " revival " of " The Mikado " or " Pinafore " is correct only in the technical sense that anything after the first run of a play is a revival . There can be no reviving of that which is always alive , but varies only in the degree of its incidence on the public mind , ranging from a classic to a craze . If never in the history of the stage have words and music been so blissfully wedded , it was , in its very happiest moments , a marriage of oppol sites .

Purists have maintained that the Georgian and so-called " Colonial " architecture is not American . This 151 as true as to say that because the architecture of the French and Italian Renaissance showed marked Roman and Greek influence it was not distinctively French or Italian . The inspiration , and often even the design , of the early American houses and churches was largely English . But it was so adapted to American needs and the American setting that it acquired a distinct American flavor . Whatever the origin of different features of decoration and design , the ensemble is a product which is so closely identified with the older America that it may be said to have embodied the American spirit in architecture . The saving as a museum of the Harwood House and gardens means another masterpiece preserved for the inspiration of future architects .
