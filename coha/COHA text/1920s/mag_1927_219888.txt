When blind Senator Thomas D. Schall goes home to Minnesota he will feel and hear a disturbance in the political air . Malignant Minnesotans , particularly friends of Magnus ( " Magnavox " ) Johnson , whom Mr. Schall defeated in 1924 , are saying that bootleggers contributed to Mr. Schall 's campaign fund . Such charges being " a dirty mess on the doorstep of the state , " the State Senate last week voted , 54 to 1 , to conduct an investigation . It matters not that the U. S. Senate looked into Mr. Schall 's election last spring ( TiME , June 28 ) and found it pure enough to allow him to hold his seat . <P> Said Senator Schall on hearing of the investigation : " It is a well laid political move , backed by the same big moneyed man , E. W. Backus of Minneapolis . " Mr. Backus is a paper-lumber-bankerman.
