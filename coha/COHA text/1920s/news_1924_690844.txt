txt When this newspaper says that only a lingering dread of its possible political effects prevents an increase in , the dividend rate on Atchison stock it speaks by the book.I It is not easy to understand how that fear has survived the election and quite impossible to believe it will survive , it long . Atchison 's dividend rate was made 0 per cent . in 1903 , when the company 's lines were 2,000 miles less than today , its funded debt 522.000.000 greater , its earned surplus in transportation facilities some $145,000,000 less , its physical condition doubtless inferior , its double track to the coast project only fairly begun . Atchison has never declared extra or stock dividends , as it might properly have done ; : t has never bought property outside its own business . For six years after the incorporation of the company , in 1697 , , the common stckholders received nothing and for another six years no more than 4 per cent .

Or do n't they believe in private ownership of railroads ? It would unquestionably be illuminating if the Atchison directors took a referendum to determine whether , and to what extent , the dirt farmers of Kansas would resent a higher dividend rate upon Atchison stock . Let them be asked to say who had done the more for Kansas , the late E. P. Ripley or the whole race of sockless senators from Simpson to Capper . Socklessness was never so much a condition of the feet as a state of mind , but while a state of mind may move a man from Topeka to Washington , or hack again . : t avails little to move wheat from Pottowattamie County to Chicago or Galveston . Common stockholders are rightly expected to wait until every one else , including shippers , employes , bondholders and preferred stockholders , have been served . As an inducement to such exemplary patience and the grace to go without when necessity arises , they are promised a more liberal helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as much entitled to the performance of the contract as they are bound by the obligation voluntarily assumed . As for a railroad 's public relations , do the directors of the Atchison considor its position superior to that of Union Pacific dr New York Central ?
