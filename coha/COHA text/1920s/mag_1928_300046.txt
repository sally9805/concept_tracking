In Sao Paulo , Brazil , last week , a one-ring circus was held . At the end of circus , as a final and most brilliant attraction , a wrestling match was arranged between a gigantic nameless Bahian Negro and a small , engaging Jap , name unknown . After a few minutes wrestling , the black Bahian had the Jap on his back ; but the Jap rolled over , snickering , and at the end of the wrestling he was sitting like a prime minister upon the dark and heaving stomach of his adversary . <P> The fight was important , not because the contestants were famous , but because they used different and interesting styles of wrestling . The Bahian lout fought after the manner of Brazilian capoeira . This is the national style of fighting ; it includes blows as well as grips and it was perfected , as might be imagined , by a huge band of Hoodlums who once terrorized Rio de Janeiro . Even kicks in the head are allowed and the Bahia Negro attempted these , without avail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used a style of combat peculiar to his nation ; Jiu Jitsu , the gentle and famous art of making an opponent use his strength to encompass his own defeat . For 3,000 years the Japanese have used this graceful and economical method of self defense . Jiu Jitsu must not be compared or confused with another often pictured species of Japanese wrestling , somewhat like capoeira , in which two 400-lb. bullies stand face to face and each endeavors mainly by pulling at the sparse clothing of his adversary to topple him over . Jiu Jitsu requires enormous training ; Jap boys rise early to practice it before taking cold baths . Occidentals , while they will never be as good as lithe little yellow wrestlers , may become proficient by virtue of talent and application . President Roosevelt loved Jiu Jitsu and recommended that it be taught in West Point and Annapolis .
