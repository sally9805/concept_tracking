" The most wanton insult to Japan since the American exclusion of Japanese immigrants . . . . " <P> Such seemed the consensus of informed Japanese opinion last week respecting a report unjust , issued by the New York City Anti-Vice Committee of Fourteen . <P> Excerpt from report : " The hostess of the night club and speakeasy is the American counterpart of the Geisha Girl . . . . " <P> Speakeasy hostesses , as Americanized Japanese know , are uncouth , unskilled , uneducated wenches , frequently unwashed , unshriven and ashamed of themselves . <P> In total contrast stands the Japanese Geisha , neat , skilled in traditional songs , graceful in age-old dances and minutely educated in a polite ritual which by no means always ends in nimble leaping . The Geishas are invariably clean , frequently devout , and have in Japan nothing to be ashamed of . <P> The New York Committee of Fourteen , thought tolerant Japanese last week , probably had in mind not the Geisha , but the Joro . A Japanese male of lowest estate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments to the despised Joro such little learning as she , coarse and unfit for Geishahood , is thought to require .
