Like a snarling , wounded panther , outraged Catholic France crouched ready to spring upon its enemies . Indeed , its attitude was so menacing that it was difficult to see how pipe-puffing , anticlerical Premier Herriot could survive its pounce ; and if he does , it can certainly be predicted that his way will be short and beset with thorns . <P> The trouble , which last week led to the initial stages of a religious war , started last year , when the Premier promised suppression of the French Embassy to the Vatican and enforcement of the laws relative to religious orders ( TIME , May 19 , Sept. 8 ) which were allowed to reenter France during and after the War . The Premier also promised to apply all the religious laws to Alsace and Lorraine which were to be enforced in France , despite earlier promises that the two Provinces would be permitted to enjoy the full religious freedom that they enjoyed under the Germans . <P> Alsace .

They also advised Catholics to emulate the Radicals who " march in a body to the doors of city halls , prefectures and ministries , send protests , delegations and ultimatums to the authorities , resort to all sorts of proceedings , even to strikes , and besiege and harry the Government , which almost always ends by giving , in to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , Premier Herriot responded to the Cardinals in an excellent imitation of " Papa " Poincar 's famed Sunday speeches .

We are laymen and we are fighting for laicism , which is not an aggressive doctrine . We stand for freedom of conscience and we protest when in this 20th Century an attempt is made in the name of dogma to constrain conscience and when we are told , as our ancestors were told in the Middle Ages , that Science and Liberty are idols.
