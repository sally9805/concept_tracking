txt Rear AdMilra/ Hilary P. Jones , Chairman of the Executive . Committee of the General Board of the Navy , told the House Air-11 craft Committee during testimony on naval aviation today that the Philip- ' pines could be taken easily , but he refused to admit that it could be done in Zwo weeks , as asserted by Brig . Gen. William Mitchell , Assistant Chief of the Army Air Service . In several other particulars the Admiral ran counter to , assertions of the flying General , but he showed almost enthusiastic support for aviation . At one time , when asked if he thought that airplanes are necessary to the navy , be replied : " Oh , my dear sir , yes . They are indispensable . " Admiral Jones was . the first of the Witnesses to be heard when the committee reopened its hearings today . He was asked to supplement the special report Prepared by the General Board on Aviation After the conclusion of his testimony , announcement was made that Secretary , of War Weeks would be called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the stand . tomorrow . Tinker 's Testimony Assailed . Representative Pratt of New York wants to question Secretary Weeks as to the difference in statements between him and General Mitchell as to the number of available airplanes . This afternoon Clifford A. Tinker of New York was examined as to a. magazine article in which he blamed Congress for failure to provide helium for the dirigible Roma , which was destroyed in 1921 . In the . Course " of his statement Mr. Tinker criticized General Mitchell and offered data , which the committee regarded as ' ! hearsay . " After a warm session , during which his testimony was assailed Dy Representative Prall as " unreliable , " the material was stricken from the record , and the committee voted not to hear Mr. Tinker further . The committee decide ? to accept the invitation of the Secretary of War to attend the demonstration of anti-aircraft guns at Fortress Monroe , March G. Admiral Jones was questioned at length about reductions in naval aviation which , Representative Prall declared , amounted ' to one-third , while other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A direct question by the New York Member asking the Admiral if he knew whether the President had ordered the reduction or not brought a negative reply . Admiral Jones said he did not know bow it took place . The reference to the Philippines came later when Representative O'Sullivan of Connecticut propounded a series of questions as to islands from which airplanes of a foreign power could attack the United States . Bermuda was the first mentioned , with the explanation that there was no equipment there for attack- From Cuba . it was stated , it would be possible to fly to Florida . Jamaica was the next named . " Coulct an airship fly f rain Jamaica to the Canal Zone-a ' Admiral Jones was asked . " Yes , it could fly there , " Admiral zones said . Formosa , a Japanese poss , ession , was next referred to as a place from which flight could be made to parts of Luzon in the Philippines . Mr. O'Sullivan asked as to whether it would be possible for a foreign power to take the Philippines by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by air alone . " Admiral Jones said . He added a moment later that he thought It would require a fleet and air attack . " We are better off in the Philippines than a lot of people think , " the Admiral declared . " They could be taken , of course . " " In two weeks ? " Mr. O'Sullivan asked . " Two weeks is a pretty short time , " Admiral Jones answered , ' ' to get them and ' dig iii ' . I would not like to say what time it would take . " Says the Islands Are Vulnerable . " But they are very vulnerable , " it was suggested . " Oh , yes . " he said . Admiral Jones said it would be difficult for hostile airplanes to attack the United States from their home bases , the distance being so great as to make such an attack not really serious , Called upon particularly to answer questions as to the relative importance of airplanes In the naval scheme , Admiral Jones defended the special report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that we would wave no trouble within the next ten rears , " he said , " we would know how to prepare for a possible war . But tinder the present circumstances it is the opinion of the board that all units of the navy , aircraft included , should be improved simultaneously , not one to the detriment of the other . " The witness asserted that the American Navy , in number and tonnage of capital ships , is fully up to the 5-5-3 ratio of the Washington arms conference . " But we are woefully weak in airplane carriers . the only other craft limited by the treaty . " he added . Representative Prall asked if he thought a ** bomb dropped from the air would destroy a battleship , one of the points that had been made by General Mitchell . " If it were not an armor-piercing shell I think its effect would be local , " Admiral Jones said . " It might do some destruction to exposed personnel , and might have a serious effect on . local fire control installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious effect on the motive power , the turrets or the , personnel in enclosed places . " He said that the effect would probably be very serious if the bombs were dropped alongside within ten feet of the vessel . The questioning turned to the tests on the battleship Washington . Admiral Jones stated that two 1,400-pound armor piercing , non-explosive bombs were dropped , and that while one hit the deck . it did not go through . " The object , " the witness explained , " was to ' test the resistive qualities of the deck protection . It was not to give aircraft a chance to destroy a battleship . " " Then there can be no criticism of aircraft during that test . " he was asked . " No , not at all , " the Admiral replied . Asked if he did not think to have sunk the Washington from the air would have been of value , he stated that it would not because information about bombing was obtained in 1921 . Defends Bombing Test Officers . " Let me say here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press have repeatedly impunged the honor of the navy officers who conducted the test on the German ship Ostfrieslarad . This has been done time and time again . and'it is unfair . Why , heavens . if anybody knows whether aircraft can put a battleship out of commission the navy would want to know , for our very existence would depend upon it . We are of the opinion that the battleship is dominant . " Mr. O'Sullivan asked if the navy was afraid that a bom would sink the Washington . " Absolutely not , " the Admiral said . " He told the committee that he had been informed by the Secretary of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics that , in an emergency , it would be possible to get quantity production of airplanes in six months . Representative Frail brought up the question of the extent of the reduction in naval aviation . After the first estimate of $32,000,000. the amount requested by the Bureau of Aeronautics , the request was reduced to $16,000,000 , with $4,000,000 authorized . Subsequent to the report on aviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,000,000 , making a total of $19,000,000 . " No other activity in the navy was cut one-third , " Mr. Frail said . Admiral Jones pointed out that the cruiser recommendations had been practically all reduced . " There may have been a good reason for the one-third reduction , " Mr. Frail commented , " but It seems to me that a cut of one-third was abnormal . " " How they work things out I do n't know , " Admiral Jones observed . He did not think the reduction had been too heavy . It was shown that of the total estimates for the navy of $3:12,000,000. the estimates as finally submitted to Congress call for $289,000,000 , with an additional authorization of $4,000,000 for aviation . - Mr. Prall said that the responsibility rests upon the department , and that it was evident that Congress had not reduced the sums to a great extent . Before the budget was established , Admiral Jones stated , liberal appropriations for aviation were recommended . Mr. Prall said further that the records would show that neither the departments nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend itself , " Admiral Jones continued . " I know the Navy and War Departments have tried to get what they could for aviation . " " Probably somebody does not understand the requests as well as the departments themselves . " Mr. Prall added . ' They know pretty well , " Admiral Jones commented . American Submarines Ontranged With regard to submarines , the Admiral stated that those of the United States compare fairly well with those of England . Japan and other countries , but he pointed out that the other countries are building longer range submarines than this country pos ; esses . A recent statement accredited to Admiral Fullam. in which he asked for a " three-plane " navy , advocating preparedness in the air , under the water and on the surface , was discussed . Admiral Jones said that he " would not class him as an expert on modern naval matters . " With regard to his own experience with aviation , the witness pointed to a feat under his own direction when eighteen planes were flown from Hampton Roads to Panama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes taking this test , and , while he- was not a pilot , the ships were moved under his command . Airplanes , he agreed , will increase the operating efficiency of the navy and its offensive power . He was asked as to what distance away the charges were set which were exploded off-side the battleship Washington , but declared that he ' Would rather not reveal that , as it was a confidential matter . Captain Aaron Bradshaw Jr . told the committee that ' actual war conditions would prevail as nearly as possible during the tests at Fortress Monroe next week . He was asked how many gune it would take to defend New York , but said that he could not answer , as the question is being worked on now . At present 159 anti-aircraft guns are in use and 166 more are . available for training purposes . The statement- of . Clifford A. Tinker resulted in a sharp tilt with members of the committee . During his remarks , which were later ordered out of the record , he said , in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army and Navy Air Services have little or nothing to show for the expenditure of $433,000,000 appropriated by Congress since the Armistice. and that the reason for this Is that the existing system is wrong . He has made the statement that the Army Air Service has only nineteen first-class airplanes with which to meet an enemy attack . " Now , General Mitchell has been assistant chief of army aviation following his return from Europe . In that capacity he , above all others in the Army Air Service , has been responsible for the expenditure of funds for the procurement of aircraft . If his statement that the Army Air Service has but nineteen first-class airplanes with which to meet an enemy is true , then , in my opinion , he convicts himself out of his own mouth as incompetent inefficient and wasteful in the expenditure of the Government funds . " Notwithstanding this , he seeks , through the creation of a united air force , to become a marshal of the air in order to give full sway to the extension of incompetency , inefficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of naval aviation , the Air Mail Service , the regulation and development of civil air navigation , and all other Governmental activities in aviation . " I am reminded of the Biblical story where the master said to the steward : ' Well done , thou good and faithful servant ; because thou hast been faithful over little things I will give thee charge over many things . ' But times have changed . It appears that the master should have said : ' Well done . thou self-seeking and wasteful servant ; because thou has been faithless over little things , therefore will I give thee charge over many things . ' " While General Mitchell may charge , or . admit , that the Army Air Service has little or nothing to show for its share of the $433,000,000 expended for aviation since the armistice , the navy has no such confession of failure to report . On the contrary , I am proud of our record of achievement in the development of aviation for naval purposes . I am frank to say that I regard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult than are the problems in the development of army aircraft.  --  The difference is that the navy has attended to business , has tried honestly to solve its problems , and is not concerned with offering excuses for failures nor with trying to reform the other service . " If General Mitchell and his followers in the Army Air Service had been half as diligent and attentive to duty in the development of army aviation as the navy - has been in the development of naval aviation , General Mitchell would not be in a position to confess the fail'urea that he has confessed . There would have been less time for polities and propaganda , and more results . " Mr. Tinker was interrupted by Representative Prall when he began to read some of the accomplishments of the navy . Mr. Prall insisted that the testimony should bear upon the , magazine story in which Congress was criticized for lack of funds to provide helium for the Roma . A letter was produced by Representative Reid showing that approximately $1,000,000 was available for helium before the Roma was destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his atateipent4 as IlePresentativePrall put it , he was severely criticized . Mr. Prall declared that in his judgment the story " was unreliable , unfair and untrue . " Tinker 's Story on the Roma. said With regard to the Roma , Mr. Tinker s " I learn from the press that I have been accused by a member of this committee of stating an untruth in a magazine article published in Collier 's Magazine on Jan. 24 , 1925 , in which I stated that Congress was responsible for the loss of thirty-four lives , due to the failure to provide for the transportation of helium from Fort Worth , Texas , to Langley Field , Va . The circumstances surrounding this case are as follows : " In October , 1921 , I returned from Europe with the bodies of our naval men killed in the ZR-2 accident . I advised that that airship be filled with helium land flown to Washington to show Congress the great advantages of helium over hydrogen , inasmuch as Congress was discouraged , with airship development . My recommendations were carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 121 the first airship to be filled with " About this time the Roma was placed in commission  --  a second-hand ship which had been dismantled in Italy , packed in the hold of a. steamer and re-assembled in the United States . Necessarily , her fabric was damaged in transit and the Ansaldo motors with which she was originally equipped were replaced by Liberties , and her speed increased beyond the limit which the structure of the ship would stand . " I was invited by General Mitchell to take a trip on the Roma and told him that I would do so if she were filled with helium . He stated that funds were not available . I was further invited to take a trip on the Roma by Major Van Nostrand , who at that time , I believe , was in charge of lighter-than-air developments in the army . I gave him the same condition  --  that I would gladly take a trip on her if they would fill her with helium , and 1 figured out at the time that sufficient helium could be transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be taken on a navy ship and transported to Hampton Roads , the cost of transportation and handling to be $14,000 . Major Van Nostrand assured me that they had no funds for the purpose . In fact the Fort Worth plant was closed down for lack of funds , and was not opened again until dAulraiiscti. 1922 . Van Nostrand not to-Itakaedvtlisiee Roma out of her hangar ; it would be dangerous- to do so . I called on the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation of the House of Representatives and plead with him to supply the money for the transportation of helium , and was told that Congress was not interested in lighter-than-air . " In the meantime , the ship was put into operation , and on Feb. 21 , 1922 , met with disaster , killing thirty-four men . The accident would have happened had she been inflated with helium , but the loss - of life from the burning of the hydrogen would not have taken place . The inability of Congress to function in this matter , I believe to be responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion based on the facts and I have stated this opinion in writing in Collier 's magazine . also in an Interview in The Washington Star , given on , the . date of the disaster , and ; alsci- in another ' interview with - THE IDT-leanc.Tnane on the , following'day.
