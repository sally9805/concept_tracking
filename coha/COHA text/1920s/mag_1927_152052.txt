Arthur Brisbane , Hearst newspaper seer , might have been moved to repeat one of his favorite homilies- " a sight to delight Darwin . " Indian Chief Tall Feather , aged 42 , was running along the broad highways from Milwaukee to Chicago . Sleek automobiles swished by him . On his right , electric interurban trains were hissing and steam locomotives were chuffing ; on his left , steamers were cutting the waters of Lake Michigan . It was a scene such as every child has seen in the educational " wonder books . " Tall Feather covered the 88 miles ( without stopping ) in 19 hr. 47 min. - no human had ever before run between Milwaukee and Chicago in so short a time . His reward was a purse of $1,000 . His modern name is Levi P. Webster and he lives in Green Bay , Wis.
