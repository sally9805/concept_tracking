A MERICAN cooking is in general bad  --  both public and private . But at that it is better than English cooking . Domestic science taught in the schools and colleges has helped only a little ; too often making our cooking decorative , inept , and given to fruit salads , boiled mayonnaise , paper frills , and striped ice cream . But good American dinners may be had in any community . In every town or village is always at least one righteous woman who can cook . And yet whole sections of the land , groups of States , have not one professional man cook worth naming , and no hotel cook who has either distinction or even rudimentary capacity to fry sour apples ! The American dinner typically is seasonal and served somewhat in the degree of familiarity with which the guest is known . In summer an American dinner would contain fried or broiled spring chicken and strawberry shortcake  --  made with actual shortening . After the strawberries go , comes corn on the cob , blackberry cobbler or green apple dumpling ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When young chickens become pass ? , turkey appears with its trimming ; and then pie  --  pumpkin pie , apple pie , or mince pie  --  is part of the typical American dinner , and the glace sweet potato , the parsnip , and the rutabaga . Of course ice cream , which of late years has been universally over the earth served , is rather typically American . Now all this is the company dinner ; the dinner for the stranger guest . But when he has been in the house for a week , or if he is a dear and trusted friend , he is served with a beefsteak of parts and consequence  --  cut two inches thick , broiled " rare , " and served with sauce or without it . The beefsteak is American . It is one of the things which may be found in American homes served better than in public  --  that is in homes where discerning Americans live . A beefsteak is the most American of our dishes . No other nation knows it  --  this big , thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side and broiled slowly after the searing without anything in the pan  --  no grease , no water , no foolish condiments . It is not regional . It is as accessible in Seattle as in Palm Beach . But a good beefsteak is the same onevery American table . Around it any dinner that is built scientifically becomes rather keenly American . But it is not the " company " dinner . That clusters around fried chicken , roast turkey , baked ham , or some sectional sea food . No man ever gets a typical American dinner at a New York hotel . The better the hotel , the less likely one is to get an American dinner and the worse it will be when it is served . Our best hotel cooks have the European tradition . Their American accent is always bad . A La Maryland By H. L. MENCKEN E ATING is no longer practiced as a fine art in Maryland . There are , in fact , not three public eating-houses in the whole State where decent victuals are still to be obtained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling off in my time . Prohibition , of course , is to blame . The old-time Maryland gentry are not rich ; in the main they ca n't afford to buy wines and liquors at the current bootlegging prices . So they cease to entertain , for they can no more imagine inviting a civilized , guest to a dry dinner than they can imagine putting him to bed with the hogs . For many years there was a standard Maryland dinner , served with few variations on all festal occasions , public or private . It began with olives and celery , proceeded to a plate of thin soup ( usually mock turtle ) , then to Chesapeake Bay oysters on the half-shell , then to terrapin in the Maryland style , then to roast wild duck , and then to some modest sweet or ice , and coffee . Sometimes a salad was added . If so , it consisted of hearts of lettuce with thin slivers of Maryland country ham ; the dressing was always olive oil and vinegar  --  much more vinegar than oil . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Madeira ; the vile cream sauces favored in New York were absolutely unknown . The duck was served bleeding if the guests were New Yorkers , but rather well done if they were cultivated Marylanders . The oysters were always large ; no Marylander ever ate a small oyster . The only condiment put upon them was a , drop of lemon juice . With this dinner there went an invariable program of alcoholic beverages . Cocktails were very seldom served ; the first drink was almost always a glass of dry sherry . With the terrapin came champagne and with the duck some sound red wine , usually a heavy Burgundy . With the coffee came a liqueur  --  almost always fine brandy . The highly flavored and scented liqueurs were never served save when harlots were present . After dinner it was proper to put a bottle of Madeira on the table , or , failing that , port . Such dinners are now only dreams . Prohibition has extinguished them , save in the homes of profiteers . Even the profiteers , alas , ca n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going downhill for a dozen years past , canvas-back ducks have become extremely scarce , and genuine diamond-back terrapins are almost unobtainable . The Marylander of today eats the common fodder of the republic . Like all other Americans , he has been ironed out . Where Pie Is King By DON C. SEITZ EW England does not run to course dinners in the I ordinary daily fare . The housekeeper usually " contrives " one dish with trimmings . Certain days have a specified menu . Thursday , for example , is the day of the " boiled dinner . " This consists of a considerable piece of corned beef cooked with turnips , beets , carrots , and cabbage  --  plenty of " rubbage , " it will be observed . Dinner is a noon , not an evening meal . Supper is light except on Saturday evening , when baked beans and brown bread are insisted upon . If there is company , in fall when the porkers are ripe , this bill of fare may be accepted as perfect : Baked beans Roast Spare ribs Baked potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian pudding is a delicious compound of corn meal and molasses , served with cream . Pie is the universal dessert and adorns most meals , including breakfast , north of a line running from Bellows Falls , Vermont , to Portland , Maine . For Friday , fish chowder is the dinner dish . It is best made from cunners , a fish with firm , sweet flesh , frequenting the rockbound bays of Maine . The chowder is embellished with round " Boston crackers " split in half . Pie and coffee in large cups , with milk , completes the repast . " Broiled scrod " ? haddock or young cod cut across the grain ? is a favorite breakfast dish . Codfish tongues with pork scraps is another . Portland will not eat flounders , our own filet de sole . There they are " mudfish . " Salt codfish is an important item of food . Boiled with beets and served with pork scraps ( cubes of salt port fried brown ) , it is considered delectable . If any is left over , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " red flannel hash . " Doughnuts and coffee go with every breakfast , as well as pie . For a supper , ginger cookies and tea serve . The pie allowance for a well-regulated Maine family of five is twenty-one per week ! When Company Comes in Tennessee By E. E. MILLER A TENNESSEE dinner , in October , for a welcome guest  --  a farm dinner , of course , since city dinners , like cities themselves , trend away from the individual and toward standardization . Country dinners shape themselves around one central dish , and at this season that dish is foreordained . Fried chicken it must be  --  not the little spring chicken , the creature of a few ounces and a few mouthfuls , but a lusty , coop-fed fellow at the limit of frying size , each drumstick a juicy and satisfying portion , each piece of breast flake after flake of tender whiteness . He is fried just to a golden hue , the skin crisp but not crackly , piled piece upon piece into a great pyramid on a broad platter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We give the preacher fried chicken when he conies , or Cousin Dave from the next county ; it is what we should give a prime minister if he came ; for in all the length and breadth of this lavish land there is nothing better to give . On one side of the master-dish waits the plate of boiled ham  --  disks of piquant pink tastiness that quicken appetites anew . On the other , the big bowl of gravy and the yell6w , syrupy sweet potatoes  --  who has not eaten chicken gravy and sweet potatoes has something yet to live for . Butter beans , too , and okra steaming hot , and scarlet tomatoes crisp and cool . Hot biscuits , inevitably  --  soft , thick , fluffy biscuits that divide at a touch and melt on the tongue , never a crust about them , only a hint of brown on top and bottom . Rivaling them , brittle corn sticks into which the butter fairly flows . And jellies  --  that glass of royal wine-color is blackberry jelly ; that clear red is apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get around to , but our hostess , in wholesome pride , may offer us along with them preserves of equally varied colors and equally intriguing flavors . We countrymen do not care much for the courses with which dinners may begin . Fried chicken is for us a good enough beginning ; but dessert there must be , and the dessert of apple-ripening season is prince of them all . Long before it comes into sight tantalizing fragrances drift in to us from the kitchen , and when it appears every eye brightens and every nostril widens . Apple dumplings ? The winiest-flavored apples fresh from the orchard , gently baked and slowly simmered a long , long time in a deep earthen dish , a garment of flaky crust about them , sugar and butter and the spices of Araby in their hearts . We pour over them a sauce of liquid sunshine and the dinner rises to its ecstatic conclusion . Preacher , prodigal , visiting cousin , revered celebrity from distant lands  --  the guedt has been well fed . In the Creole Capital By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as much a mystery , and will , I blush to confess , remain so , as tatting or Miss Stein 's " Tender Buttons . " But here , down in " Ny Orl'ns , " it is a pleasant task to catalogue the victuals and vintages ( in the French m  --  nage of means and a cellar this latter item is still featured ) that find their way into the anatomy . You are , we will say , a modest fellow of some importance . You have been invited to dine at the home of a prominent Creole family . If your host is a gentleman and a pirate , and he is usually both , an ojen , a Martini , or a Sazerac cocktail ( he will assure you if the last is proffered that his man mixes them with a skill equal to that of the head bartender at the old Royal Street establishment ) is thrust under your nose and you sip not unreluctantly thereof . Perhaps he is well stocked and plies you with another ; and perhaps a third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly placed . The stage  --  beg pardon , the table  --  is set . The man , a sepia-toned old South Senegambian , yassahs and ' scuse-me 's in the best tradition . Is it oysters on the half shell or shrimp cocktail ? Either is right . Is it crayfish bisque or consomm ? of fowl or mock turtle ( not gumbo at a course dinner ) ? It- is soup in any event . Hors d'oeuvres ? Well , as you will , from stuffed olives to pate de foie gras . Fish ? Broiled pompano , sheepshead a la Normande , snappers . With the arrival of the entree , if your host is true to form , a pirate and a gentleman , you have had with your soup , sherry ; with your fish , white wine ; and are beginning to feel  --  well , just a bit drowsy ; full is more like it . You glance indifferently at your filet mignon bordelaise and demi-julienne spuds , or Mallard and stuffed egg-plant , or veal roast and candied yams . You eye suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red ink of today or last night , literally . You positively sniff at the salad : alligator pear or water cress ( de cresson de fontaine ) or head lettuce with French dressing . You are sick if a pastry , or sherbet , or charlotte russe , or some other delicacy is shoved before you . Only your caf ? noir and cognac hold any allurement now , and these in the medicinary sense . Pousse caf ? , bah ! Suississe , out ! You totter from the board bloated , taut , sweating . You swear a terrible oath under your beard and smirk painfully at a pink gargoyle somewhat suggesting your hostess . God be thanked , mother does n't lay it on after this fashion . With mother now it 's like this ? Soup : tomato , vegetable , gumbo creole , oyster stew on " Fridays and days of abstinence . " Fish : now and then . Entr  --  es : lamb or pOrk chop , veal roast , roast beef . Vegetables : cauliflower with butter sauce , spinach with toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snap beans , butter beans , red beans , cow peas , green peas , squash cakes , corn on the cob , stuffed tomatoes , potatoes in variety  --  but not all at once ; in season , my dear . Everything in season . Salad ? Well , head lettuce , alligator pear , sliced tomatoes . Dessert : apple meringue , bread pudding , peaches and cream , figs in their time , watermelon , or fruit etceteras , brought up with a fine syrupy demi-tasse , brewed and dripped by Nancy Johnson in the famous manner . And the estimable lady next door doubtless has her own ideas on the subject . Monsieur Alciatore , proprietor of Antoine 's restaurant , has his ideas also . And also Madame Begu ? ' s anonymous successor , and the anonymous successor to Monsieur Maylie 's thriving establishment . Ferd Alciatore of the Louisiane , the Galatoire Freres , and Count Cazenave of Le Foyer du Gourmet , have theirs , too . The American dinner ? New Orleans answers we eat as we must , or please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLEMENT WOOD SHE private households of moderate means in Alabama I are of two classes : first , the Negro field cabins and the mountain and mill-town white houses ; second , the more prosperous white and Negro families . The typical dinner for the Negro field or furnace hand , and the white mill hand or mountaineer , would be about the same : Sow-belly ( fat white pork ) Turnip greens and pot liquor ( the latter the water in which the greens are cooked ) String beans , snap beans , boiled onions , or some other cooked vegetable in season Corn pone ( baked of corn-meal , salt , and water ) Coffee , with " long sweetening " ? or molasses You need not ask for the soup , fish , or dessert courses . There are none . For the rare dinner of state , there might be fried chicken , or possum " an ' taters .

Turnip greens Mashed yams with pecansand cream Rice Coffee with cream Fig preserves . Crab-apple jelly . Quince preserves Garden tomatoes , with sugar and vinegar Ambrosia , or Syllabub ( Ambrosia is equal parts of orange , pineapple , and cocoanut , served in orange baskets ; syllabub is whipped cream , sweetened and flavored with vanilla ) Lady Baltimore cake ( Before Volstead 's day , scuppernong or muscadine wine would be added ; with a mint julep before the meal .

The " Dutch " Tradition By REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN THERE being , happily , no such thing as a typical Amer- ican , it follows that there can be no typical American dinner . I think of Connecticut 's oyster-stuffing for turkey as a little more alien than garlic used to be , and I 'm sure that Connecticut would consider my scrapple of doubtful patriotism . Therefore , I may but contribute to The Nation 's symposium the menu of such a dinner as average Pennsylvanians of moderate means " get up " when they want to dine ? as on a Sunday afternoon  --  rather well and altogether " natively " : Fruit Salad Roast Ribs of Pork , Apple Sauce , Mashed Potatoes , Sauerkraut , and Real Beer Mince Pie ( laced , not with brandy , but moonshine whiskey ) , and Cheese Coffee Some smuggled liqueur Dining in New Mexico By ELIZABETH SHEPLEY SERGEANT T HE New Mexican , like other Americans , orders his life with reference to eating . Among the Pueblos religion itself , as Frank Cushing once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never fared more hospitably in the pleasant land of France than in this arid corner of our country , where the very cattle are scrawny and athletic like the cowboys , and every scrap of vegetable food  --  save the nuts and sunflower seeds and wild grasses and cactus fruit , the wild currants and plums which the aboriginal inhabitants used exclusively until the development of corn  --  has to be won , not only by the sweat of the brow , but by the most cunning ditching , terracing , and entreating of scanty waters . In discussing the real American dinner , I must , however , present three menus : Indian , Spanish-American , and plain United States . Dinner is the evening meal in the Pueblo country  --  usually there are only two  --  and when you enter a house in the pueblo of Zuni , for instance , you are always greeted : " Enter , sit and eat ! " The repast is set out on the earth floor before the three-cornered fireplace in decorated pottery bowls , the family , probably ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So long as the chief males or guests of the family are not there , nobody begins to eat . When all are gathered , every person , including the children , selects a morsel of every kind of food , breathes on it , and says this " grace " : " Receive , ( oh , souls of ) my ancestry , and eat ; resuscitate by means of your wondrous knowledge , your hearts ; return unto us of yours the water we need , of yours the seeds of earth , of yours the means of attaining great age . " With this the offering is thrown on the fire and the meal begins . Cushing 's first name as a real Zuni , **47;1738;TOOLONG , is indicative of Zuni table manners . Nowadays the guest is likely to be offered a metal spoon and white cup , and granite-ware coffee pots and iron frying pans prevail . But en famine , the one earthen spoon , the gourd dipper floating on top of the olla are common , and the food in the bowl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat joints and another of frijoles ( succulent brown beans ) seasoned with plenty of chile colorado ( red pepper meal ) , onion , and salt , and probably some spicy herb . For a relish , if there are guests , stuffed sheep intestines or a skewer of broiled meat , or a blood pudding  --  close to the French boudin  --  cooked in a large intestine . For vegetables , " in season , " fried or roast or baked squash , boiled pumpkin , green corn on the cob . For bread  --  a most important item  --  he'we or wafer bread , something like our dry breakfast foods in consistency , made by cooking a thin paste of red or blue or yellow corn meal on a hot stone and then rolling it . Sometimes puffy little brown loaves of wheat flour as well , baked in the round outdoor oven of sun-dried brick , common to both Indian and Spanish villages . In the melon or peach seasons there is an abundance of juicy fruit , and dried melon rind is often baked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole the Indian meal is without sweets . Now let us approach a Spanish house in a mountain valley not occupied by descendants of the Conquerors , but by simple " Mexican " people . If the family is alone , we shall be welcomed to little but frijoles , a bowl of chile , red or green , and a pile of tortillas  --  a sort of pancake of white flour browned on top of the stove  --  and a pot of coffee , brewed and re-brewed . In the corner is a sack of pifion nuts  --  a tiny nut which is taken into the mouth in quantity and cracked with the teeth , the shells being ejected from one corner of the lips while the rich kernel is still being chewed . There will perhaps be another sort of flat pancake of blue meal , served in layers with red chile sauce between , or rice cooked with onion and chile . On feast days there will surely be a rich sweet chocolate drink , white bread baked in the round ovens , chile con came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syrup , stewed dried apricots or peaches , a custard with bananas in it . The Mexicans are charmingly ready to share their last tortilla and their fiesta goodies with American neighbors , but a Spanish servant lass , brought up to abstemiousness at home , eats less than the proverbial mouse in the rancher 's house . " What pigs they must think us ! " said one of my white neighbors . The bountiful American farm dinner in my valley is not so different from that of New England . Fried or roast meat , several kinds of excellent vegetables , macaroni baked in a glass dish  --  for the mail-order houses keep us up to date  --  preserves of various rich species , flaky hot biscuits , pie , coffee , and cheese . The American rancher would scorn to borrow recipes from the Pueblos , but tortillas , " Spanish rice , " and chile are not unknown to his table . If there is one article of diet . common to all races in New Mexico , it is this same chile colorado , which hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown walls of the houses , like the flag of an exotic civilization . Chile keeps the palate keyed up to the climate and the mountains : it is a spice of the devil to counteract the dominant presence of God on the peaks .
