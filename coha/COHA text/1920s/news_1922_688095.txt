Samson , 48 , an insane veteran of the Spanish-American and European wars , two ward attendants of the United States Veterans ' Hospital 81 for Psychiatric Cases , Kingsbridge Road and Sedgwick Avenue , the Bronx , were arrested there yesterday by Chief Investigator M. P. of the United States Veterans ' Bureau in Washington . They gave the names of Timothy Joseph Luccie , 33 , and Harry J. Morgan , 24 , both of New York City . The two men were implicated by their own conflicting stories and by testimony from staff doctors , nurses and attendants , that disproved their statements in important points . Luccie , according to Mr. , said that Samson had tripped , against his bed as he rushed from him and Morgan into his own room , and had fallen against a radiator screen . Mary A. Conkling , the nurse in charge of ' the ward at the time , testified that she had heard the sounds of a struggle in the room , ' and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet from Samson . The room was found to measure 8 feet , 6 inches from the bed to the radiator . Later , Luccie declared that he saw Morgan kneeling on Samson 's chest as the latter lay on the floor of the room .. Too Feeble to Make a Fight . The patient 's injuries were two broken ribs , a broken left wrist , two badly blackened eyes and abrasions-teethe-top of the head . Lucete'admitted , according td Mr. , that such injuries must have come from a scuffle apd from a fall . The Investigator pointed out that Samson 's nose was not hurt , which could not have been the case with both eyes injured in a fall . Morgan said that when he looked into the room after Samson 's escape in the hall the latter was standing up .. Dr. H. E. Phillips , the doctor in charge of Samson 's ward , told Mr. . that the patiant was in a greatly weakened condition from general paresis ; that his bones were easily breakable from his ailment , and that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in charge of that floor of the ward the evening last week when Samson was hurt , and has had fifteen years ' experience as an attendant . It is alleged he was discharged for gambling a year ago from St. Elizabeth 's Hospital for the Insane in Washington . Morgan has been in service only a few months . - The tussle with Samson began , the two attendants testified , after he had rushed from a room across the hall from his own room with a " glistening weapon " raised in his right hand . This was found to have been a silver teaspoon . They said that Samson fought them for three or four minutes , was finally forced back over a table , but brushed them aside " like two flies " and ran into his sleeping room in the manner narrate. above . Luccie said that he was scratched in the chin by the teaspoon , but Miss Conklin testi , Pied that Luccie 's chin was uninjured when she dressed some scratches on his arms a few minutes after the scene With Samson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in an invalid chair yesterday when visited by Mr. , William F. Deegan , New York Commander of the American Legion ; Dr. A. P. Chronquest , head of the hos- pital , and a TrMSS reporter . He talked rationally of his army life , but when asked about the alleged assault he became excited , and declared , " I gave them $70.000 to beat me up . " His right eye was bloodshot and surrounded by a heavy red-black circle . and there was the mark of a blow under the other eye . His face was pale and his limbs were emaciated . Luccie and Morgan refused to answer Mr. 's pointblank questions whether they had struck Samson , They were locked up at the Webster Avenue Police Station , and following their arraignment in the West Farms Magistrate Court tomorrow will be held for appearance before the Federal Court next Tuesday morning . Commander Deegan , at whose instance the investigation was made , after a complaint had been made to him by Agnes Samson , the injured man 's sister , complimented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficiency of Mr. 's investigation , ? and the ready co-operation given by Dr. Chronquest . Calls It Cold-Blooded Brutality . Mr. , who for more than twenty years has been a detective and became widely known through his capture of Pat Crowe , who kidnapped Edward A. Cudahy Jr . in 1900 , said last night : " In all my experience I have never seen a case like this for cold-blooded brutality . All allowance must be made for a man 's right to defend himself , but when two able-bodied men strike down an enfeebled invalid , that 's gong too far . " Others who took part in the investigation were Major Harry Boyce ( leader of " Boyce 's Tigers , " ) and Captain Irwin Rackoff , both attorneys for the New York State American Legion ; Harry Buxton , former Chairman of the New York County Committee of the Legion , awl Francis Welsh , attorney and liaison representative from the National American Legion to the United States Veterans ' Bureau in the Second District . The fact that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and are therefore unavailable as witnesses before a court , presents an unusual difficulty to the prosecution , but the Veterans ' Bureau will have the advice of the American Legion lawyers as well as the services of the United States District Attorney 's office in its efforts to secure a conviction .
