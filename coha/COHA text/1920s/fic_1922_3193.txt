" " Is n't he ? And such wonderfully strong legs ! " " See his trunk , too ! Is n't it cute ! And he is well stuffed ! This is really one of the best toys that ever came into our shop , Geraldine ; do n't you think so ? " " Yes , Angelina . I must call father to come and look at him . He will make a lovely present for some boy or girl -- I mean this Stuffed Elephant will make a lovely present , not our father ! " and Miss Angelina Mugg smiled at her sister across the big packing box of Christmas toys they were opening in their father 's store . " Oh , no ! Of course we would n't want father to be given away as a toy ! " laughed Geraldine . " But this Stuffed Elephant -- oh , I just love him ! " Miss Geraldine Mugg caught up the rather large toy animal and hugged it tightly in her arms . " Be careful ! " called her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's just a Stuffed Elephant ! " laughed Geraldine . " I mean he has n't any works inside him to wind up . He 's just full of cotton ! But I am beginning to like him more than I care for some of the toys that do wind up . I almost wish I were small again , so I could have this Elephant for myself ! " " He is nice , " admitted Angelina . " Well , I 'm glad they like me , " thought the Stuffed Elephant to himself , for just now he was not allowed to speak out loud or move around , as the Make Believe toys could do at certain times . But these times were when no eyes of boys , girls , men or women were looking . It was mainly at night , after the store was closed for the day , that the toys had their fun -- talking to one another , moving about , doing tricks , and the like of that . Now all that the Stuffed Elephant could do was to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end , and his trunk , almost like a second tail , at the other end of his body . He had two white tusks sticking out on either side of his trunk , and at first you might have thought these tusks were toothpicks . But they were not . An elephant 's tusks are really teeth , grown extra long so he can dig up the roots of trees and the plants on which he feeds . But a Stuffed Elephant does n't dig with his tusks , of course . He never has to eat , being already stuffed , you know . And the Elephant in this story was well stuffed with cotton . " I am sure this Elephant is going to be one of our very nicest Christmas toys , " went on Miss Geraldine Mugg , as she lifted more playthings from the big box that had come from the workshop of Santa Claus at the North pole . " Yes , I wish we had more like him , " added Miss Angelina . The two ladies helped their father , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delightful place for children , and many a boy and girl would have been glad to stay all day in the " Mugg Toy Shop , " as the big sign out in front named the place . " Well , here are some more of those China Cats , " went on Miss Geraldine , as she lifted some white pussies from the box . " Oh , are n't they darling ! " exclaimed her sister . " Do you remember the first China Cat we had ? " " Indeed I do ! It was bought for a little girl named Jennie . And she told me , only the other day , that her China Cat had had ever so many adventures ! " " The dear child ! The children , I believe , really think their toys are alive , and can move about ! " " Of course we can , only you do n't know it , and you never see us ! " whispered the Stuffed Elephant to himself . And then he winked one eye at a China Cat -- an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how surprised the two ladies would have been to see a Stuffed Elephant winking one eye at a China Cat . But stranger things than that are going to happen , I promise you ! " Be careful , Geraldine ! Be careful ! " suddenly cried Angelina , as her sister arose from stooping over the box , and started toward the shelves with an armful of toys . " What 's the matter ? " " Why , you nearly stepped on the Stuffed Elephant ! " " Oh , I 'm glad that it did n't really happen ! We have only one toy like him , and it would never do to have him crushed all out of shape before he is sold for Christmas . I forgot that we left him standing on the floor . Gracious , but he 's a big fellow ! " she exclaimed . " I 'll lift him up on the shelf , " Angelina said . She picked up the Stuffed Elephant . Really he was one of the largest toys that had ever come from the workshop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy , only the best cotton and cloth having been used . " Does he squeak ? " asked Geraldine , as she saw her sister set the creature with trunk and tusks on a broad shelf . " Squeak ? Goodness , of course not ! What made you think that ? " " Well , some of the toy animals have a squeaker inside them , and make a noise when you press it . I was thinking perhaps the elephant had a squeaker . " " No . If he had anything he would have a sort of trumpet in him , " said Angelina . " Real elephants make a trumpeting noise through their trunks , but of course a stuffed one ca n't ! " " Oh , ho ! You just wait until it gets dark and this toy shop is closed ! " whispered the Stuffed Elephant to himself . " Then I 'll show you whether I can trumpet or not . Though I forgot . I ca n't show you nor let you hear , it is n't allowed . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Toy after toy was taken from the big packing box . There were Sawdust Dolls , Candy Rabbits , Tin Soldiers , Plush Bears and a Monkey on a Stick -- just like other toys of the same name who had had many adventures , and about whom stories like this have been written . As the toys were taken out of the box they were placed on the shelves in Mr. Mugg 's store . This was in a back room , for the toys had yet to be sorted and looked over , to make sure each one was all right , before they were put in the front part of the store to be sold . Mr. Mugg had a larger and finer store than the one before the fire , when the China Cat had so nearly been melted by the great heat . And , having a larger store , Mr. Mugg bought larger Christmas playthings , such as the Stuffed Elephant . Finally all the new toys were taken from the box and placed around on the shelves . While Angelina and Geraldine had been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store , waiting on customers . After a bit , when it grew dark outside , and the lights were lit inside the store , Mr. Mugg locked the front door and came back into the rear room . " I think we have worked enough for to-day , " the toy man told his daughters . " We will wait until to-morrow before looking over the new things and marking prices on them . I am tired and want to go to bed . " " Good ! " thought the Stuffed Elephant . " That is , I 'm not glad Mr. Mugg is tired , " he went on , in his thoughts ; " but I 'm glad he is going to bed so I can move about and talk to some of my toy friends . It 's been no fun to be shut up in that box ever since I came from the shop of Santa Claus . " A little later the store was in darkness , except for a small light burning near the safe , so the passing policeman could look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , everybody ! " suddenly called the Stuffed Elephant , waving his trunk around in the air . " How are you all ? " " Who is that speaking ? " asked a Nodding Donkey , a toy whose head kept moving all the while , as it was fastened on a pivot . " A new chap -- a Stuffed Elephant , " answered a Jumping Jack , who wore a blue and yellow cap . " A Stuffed Elephant ! Let me see him ! I never heard of such a creature ! " brayed the Nodding Donkey , and he slid along the shelf to get a better view . For it was the mystic hour when the Make Believe toys could pretend to be alive -- when they could move about and talk . " Here I am , right over here ! " trumpeted the Stuffed Elephant , and if Miss Geraldine and Miss Angelina , or even Mr. Mugg , could have heard him they would have been very much surprised . " Oh , you have two tails ! " cried the Nodding Donkey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elephant . " The other is my trunk . It really is a long nose , but it is called a trunk . " " Is there anything inside it ? " asked a Calico Clown . " Nothing but air -- I breathe through my trunk , " the Stuffed Elephant answered . " But I , myself , am filled with the very best cotton , lots and lots of it ! Have you cotton inside you ? " he asked the Donkey . " No , I 'm wood clear through , " was the reply . " But as long as you are a new toy , let me welcome you among us . We are glad to see you . What is the latest news from the land of Santa Claus ? " " Well , let me see . So many things happen up there that I hardly know where to start to tell you about them , " replied the Stuffed Elephant . " In the first place --  --  " " I 'm stuffed , too ! " suddenly interrupted a high , squeaky voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over here ! " " Yes , Miss Sawdust Doll , we see you , " brayed the Nodding Donkey . " But please do n't interrupt the Stuffed Elephant . He is going to tell us about Santa Claus , and I want to hear , as it is some time since I came from the North Pole . " " Well , I can tell you as well as that Stuffed Elephant can , " went on the squeaky Sawdust Doll . " I came from Santa Claus 's shop in the same box with him . " " You 're not the first Sawdust Doll , though . She was bought by a little girl named Dorothy , I 've heard said , " remarked a rubber dog . " Yes , that 's right , " said the Nodding Donkey . " And her brother Dick had a White Rocking Horse . But as long as the Stuffed Elephant kindly offered first to tell us the latest news from the North Pole , I think it would be only polite to let him finish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sawdust Doll . " Well , " began the creature with the trunk and tusks , " I think I will tell you --  --  " But just then there was a whirring noise at the end of the shelf , and a little voice cried : " Oh , save me , somebody ! Please save me ! I 'm wound up too tight , and my wheels are running away with me ! I 'll run to the edge of the shelf and fall off ! Save me , somebody , please ! " A Rolling Mouse , that could run across the room on wheels when wound up , dashed along the toy shelf . As she had said , she was in danger of falling off . Straight toward the Stuffed Elephant ran the Rolling Mouse , squeaking in fright . " I 'll save you ! I 'll save you ! " trumpeted the big toy . " Do n't be afraid , Miss Mouse ! I 'll save you ! " He uncoiled his long nose of a trunk , and stretched it out toward the Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catch me ! Save me ! Catch me before I fall off the shelf and break to pieces ! " squeaked the Rolling Mouse . " Do n't be afraid ! I 'm right here ! " trumpeted the Stuffed Elephant . On his sturdy legs , big and round and stuffed with cotton , the Elephant stepped to the edge of the shelf . As quickly as the China Cat could blink her eyes , the Elephant reached across with the tip of his trunk and caught the Rolling Mouse just as she was going to slip over the edge of the shelf . Holding her very gently , so as not to squeeze the breath out of the Mouse , the Elephant lifted the tiny creature up in the air , keeping her there until her spring ran down . Then , in a spirit of fun , he reached around and set the Mouse down on his broad back . " There you are ! " laughed the Stuffed Elephant in his hearty voice . " There you are , Miss Mouse ! " " Yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ! Oh , where am I ? " squeaked the little mouse . " You 're up on my back , " laughed the jolly Elephant toy . " Do n't be afraid . Stay there and I 'll give you a ride to where you came from . On what shelf do you belong ? " " Oh , put me down ! Oh , I 'm so afraid I 'll fall off ! " cried the tiny mouse . " It is almost as high up here , on your back , as it would be to fall to the floor from the shelf . Do please put me down , kind Mr. Elephant ! " " Do n't be silly , Miss Mouse ! " brayed the Nodding Donkey . " The Elephant is good and strong , and he is also careful . He will not let you fall . " " Are you sure ? " asked the little Mouse , trembling . " Of course I will not let you fall ! " chuckled the Elephant . " Just stay quietly on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . " " But maybe her wheels will go around again and make her roll off , " remarked the Sawdust Doll . " No , the spring unwound as I slid across the shelf , " said the Rolling Mouse . " I 'm all right now . Mr. Mugg wound me up to-day to show me to a little boy . But the boy wanted a pair of skates , and not a mouse like me . So Mr. Mugg put me down on the shelf without letting my spring unwind . He stuck me up against a Tin Soldier , and the Soldier kept me from rolling around . But just now the Soldier came out to look at the new Stuffed Elephant . That left nothing to hold me back , and away I rolled . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " said the Tin Soldier , touching his red cap in a salute to Miss Mouse . " I 'll forgive you , as I know you did n't mean to do it , " said the Mouse toy , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do wish you 'd put me down , Mr. Elephant . I am nervous up on your back , broad and big as it is . " " All right , Miss Rolling Mouse , I 'll lift you down , " trumpeted the Elephant . " And here you are at your own place on the shelf . " The big toy , stuffed as he was with cotton , reached back with his trunk , gently picked up the mouse in it , and set her down where she had started to roll from . As she had said , the wheels no longer whizzed around , as the spring which made them move had all uncoiled . It had " run down , " as it is called . " There you are ! " went on the Elephant , after he had gently put down the Mouse toy . " Any time you are afraid of falling off the shelf , just call for me and I 'll save you with my trunk . " " You are very kind , " said the Mouse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he big , though ! " giggled the Sawdust Doll . " I wonder if he is strong enough to give me a ride on his back ? " " Of course he is ! " brayed the Nodding Donkey . " Do you want a ride on my back , Miss Sawdust Doll ? " asked the good-natured Elephant . " All right ! Up you go ! " With a swing of his trunk he set the Doll on his back as he had done with the Mouse . Then the Stuffed Elephant carefully walked around among the other toys , taking care not to step on any of them . " I 'm glad the Elephant has come to stay with us , " whispered a little Celluloid Doll . " I 'd love to ride on his back , but I do n't like to ask him . " " I 'll ask for you if you 're too bashful to do it , " said the Calico Clown , and he did . " Why , of course I 'll ride you , too , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ride all of you in turn -- that is all but the very largest toys . They might make my seams come open and the cotton stuffing puff out . " For the Elephant was made of gray cloth , you know , and he was sewed together , his tusks of wood being stuck in on either side of his trunk . " I thought Elephants were always afraid of mice , " said the Celluloid Doll , when she was having her ride . " Pooh ! Me afraid of a little mouse ! " laughed the big Elephant . " I guess not ! What made you think that ? " " It 's in some of the story books , " went on the tiny Celluloid Doll . " The story says real , live elephants are afraid of mice because they fear the tiny creatures will crawl up the nose holes in their trunks . " " That may be all right for real , live elephants , " laughed the big , stuffed toy . " But I am only make-believe , you know , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get up my nose . " " And if I could I would n't , because you have been so kind to me , " squeaked the little mouse toy . " Next time I ride on your back I shall not be so afraid . " " Would you like to ride now , Miss Mouse ? " asked the Elephant , as he set down with his trunk a Fuzzy Duck who had just been given a ride around the shelf . " Oh , no , thank you ; not now , " answered the Mouse . " And I think it will soon be time for us to stop our make-believe fun . It will be morning in a little while , and you know we ca n't talk or laugh or do anything in daylight , when Mr. Mugg and his daughters or any customers are in the store . " " I hope the Elephant will have time to tell us a little of what has happened in North Pole Land since we came away , " said a Rocking Horse , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , do tell us ! " begged the other playthings . " I will , " said the Elephant . So the Elephant , swaying on his four big legs , in the same way that real elephants do , told the latest news from the workshops of Santa Claus , whence he had lately come with the box of other toys . " Is Santa Claus as jolly as ever ? " asked a Tin Horse . " Just as jolly ! " replied the Elephant . " More so , if anything . His whiskers are a little longer , and his cheeks are a little redder , but that is all . I heard him tell some of his workmen , as they packed me in the box , that he hoped I 'd like it down on Earth , among the boys and girls . " " You 're sure to like it , " said the Nodding Donkey . " A brother of mine used to be in this store , and he was given to a boy who took very good care of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a little girl named Dorothy , " a Cloth Rabbit said to the Sawdust Doll . " She has lovely fun , your sister has . " " You 'll very likely go to some boy . It seems to me you are too big a toy for a little girl , " said the Calico Clown to the Stuffed Elephant . " What will happen then ? " the Elephant asked . But just then Mr. Mugg came in to open the shop for the day , and the toys had to stop talking and pretend to be stiff and unable to move . They always had to be this way when any one looked at them . " Well , " said Mr. Mugg , as he and his daughters began dusting the toys , ready for the day 's business , " Christmas is coming , and we shall soon be losing some of our toys . " " You mean people will come in to buy them , " smiled Geraldine . " Yes , " her father answered . " Well , I hope this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take good care of him , " remarked Angelina , as she moved the big toy farther front on the shelf . " Oh , my ! " she exclaimed . " His back is all dusty ! " " Dusty ! " cried Geraldine . " Did you let him fall on the floor ? " " Indeed I did not ! He has n't been off this shelf or moved since he was taken out of the box last night . " " Then I wonder how this dust got on his back . " " I have n't the least idea , " answered Angelina . " But I 'll take it off with a brush . " This she did . Of course you know how the dust got on the Elephant 's back . It came from the toys who rode him along the shelf . And , though neither of the Mugg sisters knew it , the Elephant had moved from his place on the shelf . He had walked all about it . People began to come into the store to look about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has to let some of the toy buying be done by the grown folks , and a number of them came in to see what their little boys and girls would like . Among those who passed by the shelf on which the Stuffed Elephant stood , was a jolly-looking man , wearing a big fur coat , for the day was cold and it was snowing outside . " Oh , ho ! " exclaimed the man , as he saw the Stuffed Elephant . " This is just what my son Archie wants -- an Elephant ! I 'll get this for him , as he wrote Santa Claus a letter saying he wanted a Stuffed Elephant more than anything else . " " This Elephant is just from the shop of Santa Claus , " said Angelina Mugg , as she stepped up to wait on the man . " Is he , indeed ? " " Yes , he was taken out of the box only last night . He is well made and strong , and he has heaps and heaps of cotton stuffing inside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this big Elephant would do no harm , as he is so soft . " " He is , indeed , " said the man , feeling the toy . " I suppose he does n't bite ? " he added , looking at Miss Angelina and smiling . " Oh , of course he does n't bite ! " laughed Miss Mugg . " Shall I have him sent to your house so your son Archie will get him for Christmas ? " " Thank you , it is so near Christmas that I think I had better take the Elephant with me , " said Mr. Dunn . " I have my auto outside , and as it is a closed car the Elephant will not take cold . " " I 'm glad of that , " said Miss Angelina . Very often she used to make believe the toys were real , and alive , and could take cold , and become ill . Of course she did not know that the toys really could move about after dark , when no one saw them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " went on Mr. Dunn . " I 'll hide him away in the attic until Christmas , and then let Santa Claus give him to Archie . That boy of mine just loves animal toys ! " A little later the Stuffed Elephant was standing in among some other packages in the back of the auto . On the front seat Mr. Dunn was guiding the car through the storm , for it was now snowing hard . " My ! This reminds me of North Pole Land ! " thought the Elephant , as he looked out of the windows of the car and saw the white flakes swirling about . " The ground is covered , too ! " It had been snowing some time before Mr. Dunn went to the toy store , and now he was having hard work to make his machine plow through the drifts on the way home . " They took me away in such a hurry I had no time to say good-bye to any of my toy friends , " thought the Elephant , as he snuggled down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be kept warm , you know -- that is , real ones , and this Stuffed Elephant made believe he was real . " But of course I should n't have dared say anything while people were around , " thought the toy . " I hope I see some of them again , for it was n't very polite to come away as I did . " All at once , as the auto was rolling along quite fast , it came to a sudden stop , with a bump and a jerk . " Hello ! We 're stuck ! " cried the man . " I must see if I can break through the snowdrift . " He backed the car and started ahead again , with the motor going full speed . Bang ! the car struck the snowdrift . There was a crash of glass . " Oh , dear ! " whispered the Elephant to himself , for he went toppling , legs over head , out through a broken window of the car . Into a deep snowdrift stuck the poor Stuffed Elephant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Story of a Stuffed Elephant . Page 27 " Oh , this is terrible ! " sighed the toy . " Oh , I am freezing to death ! " CHAPTER III UP IN THE ATTIC Banging puffing , and grinding noises sounded all about the Stuffed Elephant . Around him swirled the white flakes of snow , but he could hardly see them , for part of his head , part of his trunk , and one eye were stuck in the drift . Mr. Dunn 's automobile had lurched to one side as Archie 's father tried to send it through a big , white drift . And the noise was made by the motor , or engine , of the car , working its best to force the car ahead . The glass window of the automobile had broken as it tipped to one side , a piece of ice flying through . And it was through the broken window that the Stuffed Elephant had been tossed , right out into a snowdrift ! " Oh , but it 's so cold ! So cold ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold up at the North Pole where Santa Claus has his workshop , and there was more snow and ice than near Archie 's home . But up there the Elephant had been inside the warm shop , just as he had been kept in the warm toy store , and , until a few minutes ago , in the warm auto . " Well , I guess I 'll have to back up and go around another way , " said Mr. Dunn , after a while . " I ca n't make my machine go through that snowdrift . No use trying ! I 'll upset if I do ! Hello , one of the windows is broken , too ! I 'm sorry about that , but I can go on with a broken window , which I could n't do if I had a broken wheel . And I guess the toys wo n't take cold . Yes , I must back up and go home by another road . " Starting the car slowly , Mr. Dunn backed it out of the drift . The front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were covered with masses of white flakes , but aside from the broken window no damage had been done . " I 'd better hurry home , too , " said Mr. Dunn , talking to himself , a way some jolly men have . " It 's snowing worse , and I do n't want to be kept out here all night . I want to get back with the Christmas presents . Archie will surely like that Stuffed Elephant . " And then , never thinking that the Elephant had been tossed out of the broken window into a bank of snow , Mr. Dunn started his car off on another road , leaving the poor Elephant stuck in the drift . " Oh , this is dreadful ! Terrible ! " thought the Elephant . " I am freezing to death ! Santa Claus wanted me to have adventures , but none like this , I 'm sure ! What shall I do ? " If the Elephant had only been allowed to come to life and call out when Mr. Dunn was around all would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been surprised at hearing a toy speak , he never would have gone away and left it in the snow . But the toy Elephant did not dare call out , though , now that no one could see him , he pretended to come to life and began to struggle to get out of the snow . It was getting dark , and growing colder , and even a toy Elephant does not like to be left all night in a snowdrift . " Oh , if only I can pull my trunk out and get the snow from my left eye , maybe I can see which path Mr. Dunn took and follow him home , " thought the Elephant . " I do n't want to stay here alone ! It is dark , and no human eyes can see me moving . I must get out ! " He struggled and wiggled , but he seemed to be sinking deeper into the snow instead of getting out . Down , down , down into the white flakes sank the poor Stuffed Elephant , farther and farther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his auto , Mr. Dunn went along by an easier road , where there were not so many drifts . He was driving past a garage when a man outside called : " Hey , mister ! Your car door is open ! " " I guess you mean the window is broken , do n't you ? " asked Archie 's father . " I know about that , thank you . I ran into a drift . " " No , your door is wide open , and is swinging to and fro , " the garage man went on . " It may bang against something and break off . Wait a minute and I 'll close it for you . " Mr. Dunn had slowed his car as the man called to him , and now he brought it to a stop . " So the door is open , is it ? " Mr. Dunn asked . " Well , that 's too bad . I did n't know about that . It must have come open after the glass was broken . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen out . I 'd better get down and take a look . " And no sooner had Mr. Dunn looked within the car than he cried : " The Elephant is gone ! " " Elephant ! " exclaimed the garage man . " Elephant ? " " Surely ! An Elephant I was taking home to my boy Archie , " went on Mr. Dunn . " I had the Elephant in the car and --  --  " " Oh , my ! " cried the garage man , backing away , and nearly falling into a snowdrift himself . " Do you mean to tell me you had an elephant in that machine ? " " Oh , I see what you 're thinking of ! You mean a real elephant , and I 'm speaking of the Stuffed Elephant that I bought in the toy store . It 's a toy Elephant that is lost , " Mr. Dunn explained . " Oh , that 's different ! " laughed the man . " I was wondering how a real elephant could get inside your car -- unless he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toy one , " said Mr. Dunn . " And I think I know where he must have slipped out -- back at the big drift where I broke the glass of the door , trying to smash my way through . I 'll go back there and see if I can find Archie 's Christmas present . " Back through the storm drove Mr. Dunn . The snow was coming down thicker and faster , and the wind was piling it into more drifts . It was dark , too , but the headlights on the car made the road bright enough , especially on account of the white snow , for Mr. Dunn to see his way . Soon he was back again at the same drift which had made him turn about and take another road . " Now to find that Elephant , " said Mr. Dunn . All this while the Stuffed Elephant had been trying to wiggle out of the snowdrift . But , not being used to such work , he was not having very good luck . The snow was soft , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , dear ! " sighed the poor Elephant . " What am I going to do ? The snowflakes are getting in my trunk ! And they tickle me and make me want to sneeze . It 's no fun to be in a snowdrift . I used to like to look at them through the window in the shop of Santa Claus , but they 're prettier to look at than to be in . " If only a lot of the Nodding Donkeys and four or five of the White Rocking Horses were here now , they could pull me out of this drift , " went on the Elephant . " But they are n't , and I 'll have to help myself . I wonder if I gave a trumpet or two through my trunk whether that would do any good ? " He was just about to try it when , all at once , he heard a noise . " That sounds like an automobile , " thought the Elephant . " I dare n't move or trumpet if any real folks are around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I 'll sink deeper into the snow ! " Just then a man 's voice said : " It was right here I ran into the drift . The Elephant must be somewhere about here . " Dazzling lights shone in the Elephant 's one eye that was not in the drift . He saw a big auto come to a stop just the other side of the snowdrift . And Mr. Dunn , for he it was , jumped out . " Oh , now I 'll be all right , I guess ! " joyfully thought the poor Elephant . Mr. Dunn stalked through the snow , until he was close to the drift . The headlights on the car made it almost as bright as if the moon had shone . " Ah , there he is ! " cried Archie 's father . A moment later he caught hold of one of the Elephant 's hind legs and pulled him from the drift . " Here 's Archie 's Elephant ! " exclaimed Mr. Dunn . " Not hurt a bit ! Only some snow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that man at the garage saw my open door , or I 'd never have known I had lost the Elephant . Now for home ! " A moment later the Elephant was put back into the auto with the other Christmas toys . " I 'll cover them with a blanket to keep the snow from blowing in on them through the broken window , " said Mr. Dunn to himself . The Elephant was glad of this , for he felt very cold . Then back started the auto , and it was so warm and cozy under the blanket that the Elephant almost fell asleep . He wanted to talk to the other toys , and tell them what had happened , but he did not dare do this with Mr. Dunn on the front seat . At last the car turned into the drive of a handsome country place . Mr. Dunn tooted the horn , a door of the house opened , letting out a stream of light , and a boy 's voice cried : " You 're late , Daddy ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to me , Archie ! You go inside and keep out of the way until I bring in some things . " " Oh , Daddy ! What you going to bring in ? " cried a small boy . " Never mind now . They are n't for you to see -- just yet . Besides , they are covered with snow , for some came in through the broken window , and I do n't want you to catch cold . Go hide yourself , Archie , until I call you to come . " Archie laughed and went into another room , away from the front hall , and then Mr. Dunn carried in many bundles , including the Stuffed Elephant , which was not closely wrapped in paper , as were some of the others . " Oh ! From Santa Claus ! For Archie ! " whispered Mrs. Dunn . " Hush ! " cautioned her husband . " He might hear ! I 'll take the things up to the attic to stay there until Santa Claus says it 's time to put them under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the attic . It was a queer , old , dusty place , and when the Elephant had been put on the floor , with some other toys , Mr. Dunn went downstairs and closed the door . At first the Elephant did not know where he was . But he soon saw the moonlight streaming in through a window , and he noticed the other toys about him . " Hello , there ! Who are you ? " asked a creaking voice , and near the Elephant a big wheel of wood began slowly turning . " Anybody want a ride ? " asked the Wheel . " I 'm a spinner , I am , and I 'm making believe I 'm a Merry-Go-Round ! Any one want a ride ? " " Dear me ! What a strange place an attic is , " thought the Stuffed Elephant . " It is n't as nice as the toy shop , but still maybe I can have some fun . I wonder if I could ride on that wheel ? I 'm afraid I 'm too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another chance , and --  --  " But before the Elephant could ask the Spinning Wheel how to get on , all at once there was a banging noise in one corner of the attic , and a voice cried : " Make way ! Stand aside ! Here I come ! " " My ! I wonder who this is . Not a Lion I hope , " thought the Elephant . CHAPTER IV CHRISTMAS FUN Since there were no real persons up in the attic -- no boys or girls or grown folks -- to spy around , the toys and other things in the dusty top of the house could do as they pleased . The toys could pretend to come to life , and even such a thing as a Spinning Wheel could whirl about and speak . Thus when the Spinning Wheel had invited whoever wished to get on and have a Merry-Go-Round ride , and the harsh voice had called : " Make way ! Here I come ! " the Stuffed Elephant hardly knew what was going to happen . Then , all at once , a big brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole in the corner , and , with a squeal of delight , jumped up on the twirling Spinning Wheel . " Here I go on the Merry-Go-Round ! I ride this way every night ! " squeaked the Rat to the Elephant and the other Christmas toys which Mr. Dunn had hidden in the attic until it was time for Santa Claus to come around . " Do you , indeed ? " asked the Elephant . " You must have lots of fun . " " I do , " answered the Brown Rat . " But who are you ? " and he stood up among the spokes of the Spinning Wheel and looked over toward the moonlight patch on the floor where stood the new toy . " I am a Stuffed Elephant , " was the answer . " And I have just had the most dreadful adventure ! I was pitched out of the auto into a snow bank . " " I do n't like snow ! " squeaked the Rat . " It 's too cold . But I am glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ride on this Merry-Go-Round ? " " Thank you , I 'm afraid I 'm too big , " answered the Elephant . " And I never before saw a Merry-Go-Round that spun this way , like a wheel . In Mr. Mugg 's store , where I came from , there was a toy Merry-Go-Round , but it spun like a top . " " I 'm not a regular Merry-Go-Round , " said the Spinning Wheel . " I just make believe I 'm one up here in the attic . Time was when I used to spin yarn for the grandmother of Mr. Dunn . But now all yarn is spun in factories by machinery , and spinning wheels are out of fashion . So I am up here in the dust , and it makes the time pass more quickly to pretend I am a Merry-Go-Round . " " Yes , and we Rats and Mice have good times ! " cried the brown chap , as he wound his tail among the spokes of the wheel , to hold on tightly as he spun around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride , too , " said a Tin Soldier , which was another toy Mr. Dunn had brought home . " All right ! Climb up ! " called out the Rat . So the Tin Soldier , being able to pretend to come to life since no prying eyes saw him , got up on the Spinning Wheel and rode with the Rat . The Elephant wanted to have this fun , but he was too large to get on the wheel . " Besides , " he said , " something might happen to my trunk . " He was very proud of his trunk and his tusks , was the Stuffed Elephant . Several days passed , during which the toys had to remain hidden in the attic , waiting for Christmas . They did not mind it , however , as they were left to themselves and could have fun . At last , however , Christmas eve came , and when the house was quiet and still , when Santa Claus was on his way flying over the chimneys with his sleigh and eight reindeer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parlor and placed beneath the Christmas tree . And when Christmas morning came Archie Dunn came racing downstairs , in his little pajamas , crying : " Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas ! What did Santa Claus leave for me ? " " Go and look , " replied his mother . When Archie saw all his toys , but especially the Stuffed Elephant , the little boy shouted and clapped his hands for joy and cried : " Oh , what a lovely Christmas ! Oh , I always wanted a Stuffed Elephant , and now I have it ! Oh , what a fine , big Elephant you are ! " He threw his arms around the stuffed creature 's neck and hugged him so hard that the cotton stuffing almost oozed out of the Elephant 's ears . " I hope he does n't squeeze me any harder , " thought the Elephant , though he dared not so much as give a trumpet sound , and as for saying anything or waving his trunk -- that was not to be thought of ! For Archie was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunn and the servants -- a room full of people -- and of course the Elephant had to remain quiet . " Look at my new Dollie ! " called Elsie to Archie , and it is a good thing the little boy had something else to look at , or he might have kept on squeezing the Elephant until he was out of shape . " Yes , your Dollie is nice , but I like my Elephant better , " said Archie . " Elephants is for boys an ' Dollies is for girls ; is n't they , Daddy ? " asked Elsie . " I guess that 's right , " replied Mr. Dunn . " But get dressed now , children , and have breakfast . Then you may play with your toys . " Archie and Elsie were so excited over Christmas that they did not want to stop to dress , or even eat . But they managed to get some clothes on , eat a little , and then they started again to play with the many presents Santa Claus had brought them . About ten o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , gave a squeal of delight and cried : " Oh , here comes Mirabell , and she has her Lamb on Wheels ! Oh , now we can have fun , and I can show her my new Doll ! " " Is anybody else coming ? " asked Archie . " I want to show somebody my Stuffed Elephant . " Elsie looked again , before running to the door to welcome her little caller . " Yes , " went on Archie 's sister , " I see Joe , and he has his Nodding Donkey ! " " That 's good ! " laughed Archie . Into the house came Mirabell , who carried a Lamb on Wheels , which had been given her as a present some time before . " Course this is n't for Christmas , " said the little girl . " I did n't bring out my Christmas presents ' ceptin ' this , " and she showed on her finger a gold ring that Santa Claus had left . " And I got a steam engine , only I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be lame but who was better now . " So I just brought my old Nodding Donkey , " he added . " He was in the hospital once , as I was , and Mr. Mugg mended his broken leg . " At the mention of the name " Mr. Mugg " the Stuffed Elephant began to listen more carefully . If he had dared he would have flapped his big ears , but that was not allowed . " I wonder , " thought the Elephant , " if he means the same Mr. Mugg of the toy store where I came from ? I wish the children would go out of the room a minute until I could speak to the Nodding Donkey and the Lamb on Wheels . " But the children were having too much fun to leave the room . Mirabell with her Lamb and Joe with his Donkey looked at the presents Santa Claus had brought for Elsie and Archie . Then there came a ring at the door bell , and in came a boy named Sidney , with a Calico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doll . These toys were not new Christmas presents , for Dorothy and Sidney had brought only their old toys , since it was snowing again . The Stuffed Elephant was getting excited . He had heard these other toys spoken of by his friends in Mr. Mugg 's store , and wanted to talk to them . But while the children were in the room he dared not say a word . At last , however , Mrs. Dunn invited the little callers out to the dining room to have some milk and cake , and out they rushed , leaving the toys in the middle of the floor . " Ah , at last we are alone ! " said the Elephant . " Please tell me , Mr. Nodding Donkey , " he said , " were you ever in Mr. Mugg 's store ? " " I came from there , " was the answer . " So did I ! " joyfully exclaimed the Elephant . " I do n't remember seeing you there , " the Nodding Donkey said , swaying his head up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys , " went on the Elephant . " I suppose you were there last year , or the one before . " " Yes , " said the Donkey , " it was some time ago , and I have had many adventures . Tell me , did you ever have a broken leg ? " " Mercy , no ! " exclaimed the Elephant . " Well , I did . And Mr. Mugg mended it for me , " went on the Donkey , proudly . " This Sawdust Doll here , " he went on , " has also had many adventures . Tell him about them , Sawdust Doll . " " Oh , it would take too long , " replied Dorothy 's plaything . " But they are all in a book . And Dorothy 's brother Dick has a White Rocking Horse , and his adventures are in a book , too . " " For that matter I have had a book written about me , " said the Donkey . " So have I ! " declared the Calico Clown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers catching fire . " " I wonder if I 'll ever have a book written about me , " sighed the Elephant . " Perhaps , " answered the Lamb on Wheels . " You are much larger than I , and there is a book about me . But let 's have some fun , now that the children are out of the room . " " All right , " agreed the Elephant . " This is like it used to be in Mr. Mugg 's store after closing time . What shall we do ? " " I know what I should like to do , " said the Calico Clown , as he looked at the big stuffed toy . " What ? " asked the Nodding Donkey . " I should like to ride on the Elephant 's back , " went on the Clown . " All my life I have wanted a ride on an elephant 's back , and I never yet had the chance . " " You shall have it now , " replied the kind Elephant . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? I 'm pretty tall , you see . " " I 'll stand on top of this toy trolley car , " said the Clown . One of Archie 's presents was a toy trolley car , and by jumping up on this the Clown managed to reach the Elephant 's back . " Now hold on tightly , and you wo n't fall , " said the Elephant . " If I had thought , I could have lifted you up in my trunk , as I did the Rolling Mouse . But I 'll lift you down again . Sit tight now . " So the Clown sat tight , and the Elephant walked around the room with him , giving the gay fellow a fine ride . The Sawdust Doll was just making up her mind that she would be brave enough to get on the Elephant 's back , when , all at once , the Nodding Donkey cried : " Quick ! Quiet every one ! The children are coming back ! " " Oh , let me get off your back ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see me up here . It is n't allowed ! " But he was too late ! Before he could slide off the Stuffed Elephant , Archie , Elsie and the other children came running into the room ! " Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! " they cried , as they saw the Calico Clown on the back of the Stuffed Elephant . CHAPTER V IN THE BARN Hearing the shouts of the children as they hurried back into the room where the Christmas tree stood , Archie 's mother came to see what the matter was . " Oh , Mother ! " exclaimed Archie . " Look ! The Clown is riding on my Elephant 's back ! Is n't he funny ? " " He looks very odd ! " said Mrs. Dunn . " Who put him up there ? Did you lift Sidney 's Calico Clown to your Stuffed Elephant 's back , Archie ? " " Oh , no , Mother ! " Archie answered . " It was n't I. " " Nor I , " said Elsie . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn . " Well , " said Mrs. Dunn , looking from one to the other , " of course the Clown could n't have gotten up on the Elephant 's back by himself , and of course the Elephant could n't have lifted him there with his trunk . Though I know a live clown could jump on a live elephant 's back , and a live elephant could lift a live clown up in his trunk . But these are only toys . They must be moved about . " " Well , I did n't put the Clown there , " said Archie again . " Nor I ! " echoed the other children . And while this talk was going on the Elephant , the Clown , and the other Christmas toys were very much worried lest their part in the fun be found out . Of course we know how the Clown got on the Elephant 's back , but Mrs. Dunn did not , nor did the children . They did n't know that the toys had the power to make believe come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had only stayed out of the room a little longer , I would have had a chance to slip down off the Elephant 's back , and all would be well , " thought the Calico Clown . " But , coming in so quickly , they caught me ! I hope they never find out about our having fun when they are out of the room , or they 'll never leave us toys alone . " " How do you s'pose that Clown got on my Elephant ? " asked Archie of his mother , a little later . " I think some of you children must have put him there , and forgotten about it , " said Mrs. Dunn . " No ! No ! " the children cried . " Well , then Nip must have been playing with the Clown and just dropped him on the Elephant 's back , " said Mrs. Dunn . Nip was Archie 's dog , a great big fellow , but very kind and good , and especially fond of children . He was called Nip because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats . He never really bit them , though . " But Nip is n't here to take the Clown up in his mouth and put him on my Elephant , " Archie said . " Oh , I guess your dog ran in here while you were out in the other room , eating the cake and drinking the milk , " Mrs. Dunn said . " Then Nip ran out again , after dropping the Clown . Anyhow , we do n't need to worry about it . Go on with your Christmas fun . " This the children did . And having seen the Clown on the Elephant , Dorothy wanted to have her Sawdust Doll ride in the same way . So the Clown was lifted off and the Doll was lifted on . " Oh , I 'm having my wish ! I 'm having my wish ! " joyfully thought the Sawdust Doll to herself , as she was put on the Elephant 's back , and Archie pulled the big , stuffed animal about the room . The Elephant , too , was glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as he had carried the Rolling Mouse and the other toys , though of course he could not speak and tell her so , for there were children in the room . The Doll , too , would have been glad to thank Mr. Elephant , but it was not allowed . So all the Stuffed Elephant could do was to swing his cloth trunk to and fro , as Archie pulled him over the smooth floor , and all the Sawdust Doll could do was to wave her arms a little . The children thought it such fun to give the smaller toys rides on the back of the big , Stuffed Elephant that they shouted and laughed with glee , making a great deal of noise . And there was more noise when Dick , who owned the White Rocking Horse , came over with his friend Herbert , who had a toy Monkey on a Stick . " Oh , my dear children ! You are making so much noise ! " called Mrs. Dunn , entering the Christmas tree room . " Do n't you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is n't it cold out in the barn ? " asked Mirabell , as she looked from the window and saw the snowflakes falling . " I would n't want my Lamb to catch cold . " " It is n't cold in our barn , " Archie answered . " It has steam heat , ' cause my father does n't want the horses to catch cold . And he does n't want the water in our automobile to freeze , either , so he has steam heat in our barn . " " And it 's warm and cozy , " added Elsie . " Oh , out there we can have a lot of fun ! " " Let 's go out there then , " said Joe . " My Donkey likes it in barns , I guess . " " And so will my Elephant ! " called Archie . A little later the children were running over the snow to the big barn on Mr. Dunn 's country estate . The gardener had shoveled a path through the snow from the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wet . Each child carried some toy , and Archie had all he could do to clasp the big elephant in his arms . For Archie was a small boy and the Elephant was one of the largest toys . Once , on the way from the house to the barn , Archie , carrying the Elephant , stumbled and nearly fell . " Oh ! " cried the little boy , as he slipped along the snowy path . " Oh ! " The Elephant wanted to cry " Oh ! " also , but he dared not . He felt shivery and frightened , though , as he saw the banks of snow on either side of him . " I do n't want to be pitched into another drift , head first , " he thought to himself . But Archie did not fall , and the Elephant did not get a second bath in the snow , for which he was very glad . Into the warm barn trooped the children with their Christmas toys , some old and some new . Jake , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big bin , and hay from the loft , opened the doors for the children , and laughed to see how happy they were . " We 're going to play here and have a lot of fun , Jake ! " called Archie . " See my big Elephant ! I just got him for Christmas ! " " He is a fine fellow , " Jake agreed . " Shall I put him in a stall as I do the horses ? " " No , we are going to keep him here to play with , " said Archie . " And I think I 'll get a little hay to make believe feed him . " " Well , be careful , " warned Jake . " Do n't fall off the haymow . " The haymow was a big place in the barn where the dried grass ( which is what hay is , you know ) was stored away . While the other children were having fun with their toys , Archie climbed to the mow to get some hay for his Elephant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have ever tried to climb up a pile of it in a barn . And no sooner was Archie at the top of the mow than down he slid , on the hill of hay . " Oh , I 'm falling ! " he cried , and his sister and the other children came running to see what would happen . Archie slid down the haymow toward the floor of the barn . And it seemed as if he would get a hard bump . But , as it happened , a lot of the hay slid along with the little boy , and it was under him when he struck the barn floor . So he fell on the hay , which was like a cushion , and Archie was n't hurt in the least . In fact he rather liked it . " Oh , this is fun ! " he cried . " I 'm going to slide down the haymow some more ! " Again he climbed to the top , and down he slid , sitting upright as though on a chair . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pile of hay on the barn floor . " Hurray ! " shouted Joe , who , being no longer lame , could play like other boys . " I 'm going to try that ! " He did , as did the other boys and girls , and soon they had forgotten their Christmas toys for the time being , in the newer fun of sliding down the hay . Thus the Elephant , the Donkey , and the different make-believe animals were left to themselves in a distant part of the barn . " This is our chance , " said the Donkey to the Elephant . " Let 's walk around . My legs are stiff , especially the one that was broken and which Mr. Mugg mended . " " Yes , a little walk will do us good , " agreed the Elephant . " I am a bit stiff myself , and I want to swing my trunk . " So the Donkey and Elephant , making believe come to life , walked about the barn floor , while the children were farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange things in the barn -- at least strange to the Elephant and Donkey . There were garden tools of all sorts , rakes , hoes , shovels and picks . There were strange pieces of machinery for cutting hay , planting corn and potatoes , and the like . In one corner was a big wheel , with a rope around it , and for a moment the Elephant thought his friend the Spinning Wheel had come out to the barn to play . But a second look showed that this wheel was larger , stronger and different in every way . " I wonder what this wheel and rope are for ? " said the Elephant to the Nodding Donkey . " I do n't know , I 'm sure , " brayed the nodding toy . Just then the wheel turned slowly , and the long , dangling rope swayed to and fro . " I wonder what that is for ! " went on the Elephant . Like most animals he was curious about something he did not understand , just as your cat or dog will try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you reach up with your trunk and feel it ? " asked the Donkey . " I have heard you say your trunk was almost like a hand to you . " " It is , " the Elephant answered . " I will feel the rope and wheel and see what it is like . " As the children were in another part of the barn , having fun in the haymow , and as there were no prying eyes to watch , the Elephant could do as he pleased . He raised his trunk and stretched it toward the dangling rope . And then , all of a sudden , something happened . The rope turned and twisted like a snake , a loop of it wound around the Elephant 's neck , and a moment later he felt himself being lifted off the barn floor in the hempen coils . Through the air , like the pendulum of a big clock , he swayed , and as the rope pulled tighter and tighter the poor Elephant cried : " Oh , my dear friend Nodding Donkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so tight it is squeezing all the cotton stuffing out of me ! Oh , what shall I do ? " CHAPTER VI A DANGEROUS SLIDE Anxious as the Nodding Donkey was to help his friend the Stuffed Elephant , nothing could be done . For the rope had suddenly been pulled up , taking the Elephant with it . And there he swung , dangling to and fro , the coil of the rope getting tighter and tighter around his neck , choking the poor toy . " Oh , I know all the stuffing will be squeezed out of me ! I just know it will ! " sighed the Elephant . " Then I 'll look like a balloon with all the air out of it ! Oh dear ! " " Ca n't you get yourself loose ? " asked the Donkey . " I wish I could climb up and help you , but I ca n't . " " And I 'd help you , for I am a good climber , only I ca n't get off my stick . I 'm fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , something will have to be done , if I am to be saved ! " called the Elephant , of course not speaking loudly enough for the children , in another part of the barn , to hear . Archie and his friends were still having fun sliding down the slippery hay , and they were making a great deal of noise . But you know how it is yourself . You often get tired of playing one game and want to go to another . It was this way with Archie and his friends . They slid and slid and slid on the hay until they had had enough of it . Then Elsie said : " Let 's go back and get our playthings . I want to see my Christmas Dollie . " Back to where they had left the toys trooped the children , and Archie , who ran ahead , was just in time to see his Stuffed Elephant swaying on the rope that was choking him . " Oh , look ! Look at my Elephant ! " cried Archie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll be killed ! Oh , dear ! " " Run and grab him down ! Pull him down ! " shouted Joe . Archie ran , but by this time the rope was pulled up still farther and the Elephant was so far above the barn floor that even Herbert , who was taller than Archie , could not reach the plaything . " Oh , stop ! " cried Archie . " Stop hurting my nice Elephant , Rope ! " Archie 's voice was loud and clear . Suddenly the rope which had been winding up , around the big wheel , came to a stop , and a voice called : " What 's the matter down there ? Are any of you children hurt ? " " Oh , that 's Jake ! " exclaimed Elsie . " It 's our man Jake ! " " What 's the trouble there , Archie ? " Jake asked . He was somewhere in the loft of the barn . " It 's my Elephant ! " Archie answered , trying to keep from crying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rope ! " " On a rope ! " exclaimed Jake . " Do you mean this wheel rope that I use to hoist up bags of oats to the bin here ? Is it that rope ? " " I do n't know -- but it 's some rope ! " Archie answered . " Ca n't you save my Elephant ? " " Of course I can ! " called Jake . " Do n't worry ! Your Elephant is n't alive -- choking with a rope ca n't hurt him ! " " Yes , it can , too ! " insisted Archie . " It can choke all the stuffing out of him and make him flat like a pancake . " " Well , yes , that might happen , " admitted Jake . " But I did n't know any of your toys were tangled in the hoisting rope , or I would not have pulled it . Wait a minute , now , and I 'll turn the wheel the other way and let your Elephant down to you . " Slowly the big wheel turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope that was about the Elephant 's neck dropped toward the barn floor . The Elephant , also , began slowly to come down . " Thank goodness ! " said the toy to himself . " I could not have stood being hanged much longer . I 'm glad it 's over ! " And it was over a moment later when Archie could reach up , take the loop of rope from around his plaything 's neck and set the Elephant down on the barn floor . " How did it happen ? " asked Jake . He came down out of the loft , or place where he stored the bags of oats . The oats were hauled to the lower floor of the barn . There a rope was put about each bag and it was lifted to the upper floor where it was stored in a bin . The lifting rope went around a big wheel , acting like a dumbwaiter in some houses . Jake had turned the wheel by pulling on a second rope upstairs in the barn , and as the wheel turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of this rope that had looped itself about the Elephant . " How did it happen ? " asked Jake again . " I do n't know , " Archie replied . " I left my Elephant here when I went to slide down the hay . When I came back he was on the rope . " " Some of you children must have left the Elephant too near the end of the rope , " said Jake . " When I wound it up the Elephant became tangled in a loop , and of course he was lifted up . " " Nope ! We did n't any of us leave the Elephant near the rope ; did we ? " asked Archie of his little friends . " Nope ! " they all answered . " Well , that 's queer , " said Jake . " That Elephant never got on the rope by himself , I 'm sure . " But that is just what the Elephant did , as we know . " Anyhow I 'm glad he 's all right now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy . " None of the stuffing came out . " But it might have , if the Elephant had been left hanging much longer on the rope . Finding that everything was all right and that none of the children was in danger , Jake went back to the oat bin . There was a long chute , or slide , from the upper bin to a box on the first floor of the barn . And the oats came rushing down this slide when a door in the top bin was opened . This door could be opened by pulling a rope near the horse stalls , and sometimes Archie was allowed to pull the rope , open the door of the large grain bin , and let the oats slide down the chute to the smaller bin on the lower floor . But this day Jake was putting a new supply of oats in the upper bin , and Archie was not allowed to play near it . The little boy and his friends soon began having more fun with their Christmas toys , giving the Clown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus Christmas passed , New Year 's came , and the Elephant lived and was happy in Archie 's home . The Elephant did not often think of Mr. Mugg and his daughters Geraldine and Angelina . He liked it much better , did the Elephant , in Archie 's house than in the store . Of course the toy store was a jolly place , but no boys or girls were permitted to play with the toys . They were there for sale , and could only be played with after being bought and taken home . So the Elephant was glad he belonged to Archie , who was a boy that took very good care of his playthings . Nearly every day Joe , Dick or Arnold would come over to see Archie , bringing their playthings , and in this way the Elephant met many friends whose adventures are related in the other books of this series . And at night , when Archie and Elsie were in bed , of course the Elephant , and the other toys in the Dunn house , had their usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk and play about in the nursery or in the closet -- wherever they happened to be left at the close of the day . It was still winter , though Archie and Elsie wished spring would come so they might play oftener out of doors . And one rainy day , when it was too cold and stormy to be out , Archie and Elsie went to the big , warm barn to have fun . Archie carried his Elephant and Elsie had her Doll . " Let 's go upstairs to the grain bins , " suggested Elsie , when they had played about in the hay for a time . " Maybe Jake will let us open the bin door from up there , and we can watch the oats slide down the chute , " said Archie . " I like to watch the oats slide . " " So do I , " Elsie admitted . The grain bin was so built that the door of the chute could be opened from above or below . Up to the upper floor of the barn went the two children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you here , Jake ? " called Archie , but there was no answer . " I do n't guess he 's around , " said Elsie . " I do n't guess so , either , " replied Archie . " But I do n't guess he 'd care if I let down some oats . I looked in the lower bin and there 's hardly any there . I 'm going to let some down the chute . " " I 'll watch you , " offered Elsie , as she set her Doll on top of a big oat box . The cover to the box was open . Archie liked this because he could see the smooth oats go down the wooden chute , or slide , like so much water . " I 'll let a lot of oats down , " the little boy said to his sister . He placed his Elephant on the edge of the bin , near the Doll . Then Archie pulled on the handle that opened the door . It was hard work , for the oats pressed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last the children managed to get it open . " There they go ! " cried Archie , as the oats began to pour down the chute . " Yes , and there goes your Elephant ! " shouted Elsie . As she spoke , the stuffed toy fell into the oat bin , and , a moment later , the poor chap was sucked into the smooth chute , with the running grain , and the oats closed over his head . Lost to the sight of the children , the Stuffed Elephant was taking a dangerous slide . CHAPTER VII THE BIG DOG Archie was so surprised at what happened that , for a moment , he could do nothing but stand and look at the stream of oats gliding down the wooden chute to the bin on the floor below . " There goes your Elephant ! " cried Elsie again . " He fell right into the oats , Archie ! " " Yes -- yes -- I -- I see he did ! " stammered the little boy . " I 'm glad my Doll did n't go , too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better take her away ' fore she tumbles in . " Elsie reached over to take her toy from the side of the oat bin where the Christmas Doll had been put by her mistress . But Elsie 's foot slipped on some hay on the floor , she tried to save herself from falling , her arm struck her Doll , and , a moment later , the Doll was sliding down the stream of smooth oats as the Elephant had done . " Oh ! Oh ! " cried Archie . " Look at your Doll ! She went down just like my Elephant ! " " Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! " wailed Elsie . " Where has she gone ? " " Down into the oat bin on the first floor , " explained Archie . " The oats go from this big bin to the little bin where Jake takes them out to give to the horses . Do n't cry , Elsie . We 'll get your Doll back . " Archie had almost been going to cry himself when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when he heard his sister 's sobs he made up his mind to be brave and try to help her . Archie was so excited that he still held up the sliding door of the oat bin , and the grains kept on sliding down the chute , carrying with them the Elephant and Doll , though now the toys were not in sight . " Come on downstairs and get my Doll ! " begged Elsie , tugging at her brother 's hand . " Come on and get your Elephant and my Doll . " " Yes , we 'd better do that , " Archie agreed . Then he saw that he was still holding open the little door in the oat bin , so that pecks and bushels of the grains were still sliding down the chute . " I 'd better close that , or the Elephant and the Doll will be buried away down under so many oats they 'll never get out , " said the little boy . He let go the handle that they had pulled to raise the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oats from sliding down the chute . Then he took Elsie 's hand and hurried toward the stairs that led to the lower floor of the barn . Meanwhile , as you have guessed , the Elephant and the Doll were not having a very good time . At first , when the Elephant felt himself fall in with the sliding oats , he did not know what had happened . " I wonder what sort of adventure this is ! " thought the Elephant . " It 's almost as bad as being pitched out into a snow drift , though I 'm glad it is n't cold . These oats are very scratchy , though , and they make me want to sneeze . But where am I going ? " The Elephant did not know . All he could tell was that he was being hurried along in the dark with a lot of oats , for it was dark inside the grain chute . Down , down , down went the Elephant , just as he had gone up , up , up on the rope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A moment later he found out , for he was shot from the chute into the almost empty grain bin on the lower floor . Out of the chute tumbled the Elephant , and he was very glad to be in an open space once more . " But it is almost as dark as it was before , " he said . A little light came from the top of the bin which did not close tightly , but it was only a little light . But the Elephant 's troubles were not over . For no sooner had he been slid clear of the chute , landing on his feet , very luckily , than more oats poured out , for Archie was still holding open the door of the grain bin up above . So many oats came sliding down the chute that they rose all around the Elephant like rising water around a rock . The oats rose to his knees , to his stomach , where they tickled him a little , and then began to rise over his back . " Oh ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . " I am going to be covered from sight in the oats ! " And then , when the oats almost covered his eyes , he had a glimpse of the Doll coming down the chute , in a shower of oats . " Oh , you poor child ! " called the Elephant . " Yes , is n't this terrible ! " exclaimed the Doll . " Oh , how are we ever going to get out ? " The Elephant tried to answer , but now the oats rose over his mouth and he could not speak . Only the top of his head and the tip of his trunk stuck out above the oats . The Doll , having come down a little later , was not so deeply covered by the grains . She tried to stand up , to keep her head as far above the oats as she could , but it was hard work . Around and around she slipped , from side to side . More and more oats poured down , for Archie still held open the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was the Elephant . And it was now that Archie and Elsie came racing down the stairs . Archie called : " Jake ! Jake ! Come here ! Where are you ? Oh , my Elephant is in the oat bin , and so is Elsie 's Doll , and we 've got to get ' em out ! " " What 's that ? Elsie in the oat bin ? " cried Jake , who had just come back to the barn . " No , not Elsie , but her Doll ! " shouted Archie . " And so is my Stuffed Elephant . " " Well , that is n't so bad as if one of you children were in the bin , " replied Jake . " I 'll help you , though . Show me which bin . " Archie told what he had done , and when Jake opened the bin on the lower floor it was brim full and running over with oats . " You surely let down enough grain , " said Jake . " How are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And my Elephant ? " added Archie . " Oh , I 'll shovel them out , " said Jake . " Do n't be afraid . I 'll get the Doll and the Elephant . " " Well , you 'd better hurry , ' cause they may smother , " Elsie said . " I 'll hurry , " promised Jake . With a shovel he carefully took some of the oats from the bin , so that first Elsie 's Doll could be seen , and then the Elephant came into view . " There you are ! " said kind Jake , as he handed the toys back to the children . " My , was n't that a terrible time ? " said the Doll to the Elephant that night , when they were left by themselves in a closet . " I should say so ! " agreed the Elephant . " I never want anything like that to happen again ! I hope I have no more adventures ! " But he was to have more . For a time , however , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsie with her Doll , and their boy and girl friends brought over their toys to have fun with . Often they amused themselves in the big , warm barn , though never again did Archie go near the grain bin . Sometimes Nip , the big dog , would go to the barn to play with the children , and once , though not meaning to , the Elephant gave the dog a scare . It was this way . Archie had set his elephant down on the barn floor , near a big box . Nip , the dog , coming suddenly around the corner of the box , did not know the Elephant was there until a draft of wind swayed the Elephant 's trunk , making it wiggle to and fro . " Oh , my ! A snake ! A snake ! " cried Nip , who was afraid of the crawling creatures . " It 's a big snake ! " " Nonsense ! I 'm not a snake , " said the Elephant , who could speak , since Elsie and Archie were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looked like a snake ? " howled Nip . " It was my trunk . The wind blew it , " was the answer . " Hum ! " said Nip , who , now that he took a second look , saw that there was really no snake , and nothing to frighten him . " Hum ! I believe you did that on purpose , just to scare me ! " " No , really I did n't ! " said the Elephant . " Yes , you did , too ! " barked Nip . " And , just for that , I 'm going to play a trick on you ! " " Please do n't ! " begged the Elephant . " Yes , I will ! " growled Nip , who was a little angry , and not as kind as he might have been . " I 'm going to carry you away off ! " he barked . Then , before the Elephant could do anything to save himself , Nip , the big dog , caught the soft Stuffed Elephant up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant part of the barn . CHAPTER VIII AN ELEPHANT JUDGE " Let me go ! Oh , please put me down ! Where are you taking me ? " called the Stuffed Elephant to Nip , the big dog . Nip did not answer . This was not because he could not speak the toy language or the language of Stuffed Elephants . But Nip held Archie 's Christmas plaything in his mouth , and you know a dog ca n't even bark when he has anything in his mouth . He can only growl . Now , Nip was not a bad dog . And though he was playing a trick on the Stuffed Elephant , still Nip was not cross enough to do any growling . So he just kept still , and trotted along the barn floor , carrying the Elephant . Nip , being a big dog , had no trouble in carrying the Stuffed Elephant , though the toy was rather large . Stuffed with cotton , as the Elephant was , he was not very heavy , you see . " Stop ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " asked the Elephant again . But Nip answered never a word . All the dog had said at first was : " I am going to carry you away off ! " And he seemed to be doing this . Through the barn he trotted with the Stuffed Elephant in his mouth . The Elephant had never been in this part of the barn before . Archie and Elsie never came here to play . It was too dark , and rather dusty and dirty , with cobwebs hanging down from the walls and ceiling . Down the stairs trotted Nip , still carrying the Elephant . The dog trotted over to a dim and dusty corner , dropped the Christmas toy upside down on the floor and then barked : " There you are ! Now let 's see you find your way back ! I 'll teach you to scare me by making believe your trunk is a snake ! " " Oh , but I did n't do that ! Really I did n't ! " exclaimed the Elephant , as he scrambled to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because no human eyes were there to watch him . " It was all an accident , " he went on . " The wind blew my trunk ! I did n't wave it at you to scare you by making you think it was a snake . Really I did n't ! " " Yes , you did ! " said Nip , and away he ran , soon being lost to sight in the darkness of this part of the barn . For a little while the Stuffed Elephant stood there , swaying slowly to and fro , as real elephants do . He reached out with his trunk and gently touched the wooden walls . He could dimly see things all about him , but he did not know what they were . " Oh , dear ! " sighed the poor Stuffed Elephant . " I do n't like this at all ! I wonder what I had better do ? " He was trying to think , and wondering if he could walk up the stairs and find his way back to the place where Archie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly , the Stuffed Elephant heard voices talking . " Maybe he could settle it , " said one voice . " Well , I 'm willing to leave it to him if you are , " said a second . " Who is he , anyhow ? " asked a third voice . " Oh , he 's some sort of animal , " went on the first voice . " He is n't an angleworm , I know that much , but just what sort he is I do n't know . But he looks smart , and maybe he can settle this dispute for us . " " I am a Stuffed Elephant , that 's who I am , " said Archie 's pet , speaking for himself . " And who are you , if you please ? I ca n't see any one , but I hear you talking . Who are you ? " " I am the Garden Shovel , " answered the first voice ; " and I claim to be the most useful tool in all the world . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not grow . " " Nonsense ! " exclaimed the second voice . " I am the Garden Rake , and I claim to be the most useful tool the gardener ever uses . Without me the ground would never be raked nice and smooth , so the seeds could be put in . I should get the prize for being the most useful . " " How foolishly you talk ! " put in the third voice . " Every one knows that I am entitled to the prize . Talk about shoveling the ground , and raking the ground ! What can you two do by yourselves , or together , for that matter , if the ground is hard ? Answer me that . You must send for me , you know you must ! " " And who are you ? " asked the Stuffed Elephant , for this tool had not yet named himself . " I am the Pick , " was the answer . " And with my sharp points the hardest ground can be made soft , so the Rake and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all . " " No , I am ! " cried the Rake . " Indeed you are not ! I am ! " exclaimed the Shovel . " Well , there we are ! Just where we started ! " complained the Pick . " Why not leave it to this gentleman animal here . What did you say your name was ? " he asked politely , and then Archie 's toy saw the Pick , the Rake and the Shovel step out from a dark corner and stand in a row before him . " I am the Stuffed Elephant , " was the answer . " This is my first visit to this part of the barn . What is it you want me to do ? " " If this is your first visit you have never seen any of us before , have you ? " asked the Shovel . " Never before did I see any of you , " the Elephant replied . " Just the proper one for a Judge ! " declared the Rake . " He will be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if you two are , " said the Pick . " What 's it all about ? " asked the Elephant . " I do n't understand . What is a Judge ? " " Some one who tells the right from the wrong , " answered the Rake . " Listen , Mr. Stuffed Elephant ! Get up on that box , for a Judge must be above every one else , and we will tell you what the trouble is . " The Elephant got up on a strong , empty onion crate , and stood there with the Shovel , the Rake and the Pick standing in a row in front of him . " You must say ' Ahem ! ' and bang on the box , like a real Judge , " said the Shovel . " Ahem ! " coughed the Elephant , as loudly as he could . Then he took up a piece of wood in the end of his trunk , and banged on the side of the onion crate . " Now this is like a real court , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel settled . " " Oh , have you three been quarreling ? " asked the Elephant Judge . " Well , not exactly ; and the quarrel is not an angry one , " replied the Shovel . " You see , " he went on , " we three tools work in the garden . Or , rather , Jake , the man , uses us when he works . Now I claim I am the most useful of the three . Jake always takes me out when there is a bit of ground to be spaded up , or turned over , when he wants to make the garden in the spring . So I think , Mr. Judge Elephant , Your Honor , that I am entitled to the prize . " " Hum ! Let me see now , " said the Elephant , trying to look very wise . " I suppose I must listen to what the others have to say . " " Oh , yes , indeed ! " exclaimed the Rake . " We must each state our case , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is right . Now , for myself -- Oh , by the way , had you quite finished ? " he asked of the Shovel , politely . " Yes , " was the answer , " I think I said enough to have the Elephant Judge give me the prize . Go on , Mr. Rake . " " Well , " said the Rake , smiling a little to show his teeth , " I claim to be more useful than the Shovel . It is true Jake uses him to turn the ground over . But before the ground can be turned Jake uses me to take away the dead leaves and sticks that are not wanted . And even after the Shovel is used to turn the ground over , no seeds can be planted , and the garden can not really be made , until I am used again to smooth things over . So I claim to be the most useful tool . " The Rake stepped back in line with the others , and they all waited for the Elephant to speak . " Ahem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is one more to be heard . Proceed , Mr. Pick . " The Pick , who had at least two good points in his favor , stepped forward , made a stiff little bow with his handle , and said : " What my friends Rake and Shovel have told you , of course is true . They are useful , each in his own way . But I do the really hard work of the garden . When the earth is packed hard and dry , so that neither the Shovel nor the Rake can be used , Jake always comes and gets me . I am larger and stronger than either the Rake or the Shovel , though of course the Rake has a longer handle . But it is a very thin handle , and if Jake struck as hard a blow with the Rake as he strikes with me , the Rake 's handle would break . And no matter how hard he digs the Shovel into the hard ground , no earth can be turned over until I first loosen it . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with the other two , all three bowed politely and waited . " What am I to do now ? " asked the Elephant . " You must act as Judge and tell which of us is the most useful , to decide who gets the prize , " said the Rake . " That is it , " chimed in the Pick and the Shovel . " This is very hard -- very hard indeed , " sighed the Elephant . " In fact I never before knew how hard it was to decide between right and wrong . Let me think a minute . " He passed his trunk over his head , which was beginning to ache with all the talk he had listened to . " Hum ! Let me see now , " the Elephant spoke slowly . " It is true , Mr. Shovel , that you are very useful . Without you the ground could not be turned . " " There ! See ! I told you I 'd get the prize ! " cried the Shovel . " Wait a minute ! Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not finished . It is also true , " he went on , " that the Rake is very useful . Before the Shovel can be used the ground must be raked clean , and after the Shovel has spaded the earth , it must be raked smooth . " " There ! I knew it ! Oh , what a fine Judge ! He is going to say I am entitled to the prize ! " exclaimed the Rake , laughing . " Not yet ! Wait a minute ! " cried the Elephant . " I have not finished ! I want to say that the Pick used very good arguments . He is right when he says without him , in case the ground is hard , nothing can be done . And he certainly is the strongest , so I think --  --  " " Oh , ho ! What did I tell you ! I get the prize ! " cried the Pick . " Wait a minute ! I have not finished ! " said the Elephant Judge . " What I was going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the prize . What is the prize ? Bring it here that I may see it , and then I will decide who is to get it . " Illustration : " Wait a Minute ! " Trumpeted the Elephant . The Story of a Stuffed Elephant . Page 97 " Oh , the prize ! " cried the Shovel . " That 's so , we forgot all about it ! " gasped the Rake . " What was the prize to be ? " asked the Pick . " I declare we did not settle on any . How stupid ! " " Until I see the prize I can not give judgment , " said the Elephant ; " so the case will have to ' go over , ' as I believe they say in Court , until the prize is brought here . Stop disputing now , and get me the prize ! " " Yes ! Yes ! The prize ! The prize ! " cried the Rake , the Shovel and the Pick , and away they scurried . " Ha ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence had come the three tools . " What silly chaps ! " came in another voice . " To forget the most important thing of all -- the prize ! " added another . " Who are you , if you please ? " asked the Elephant , stepping down off the onion crate . " I 'm the Hoe , " was the answer of the first . " If I had wished I could have told how useful I am . In fact , I think I will have a try for the prize . " " I 'm just as much entitled to it as you are , " some one else said . " You need n't think you can get ahead of me ! " " Who are you ? " asked the Elephant . " The Wheelbarrow , " was the reply . " You ought to see the loads I carry . I ought to get the prize ! " " What about me ? " asked a third voice . " Who are you ? " asked the Elephant . " The Lawn Mower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unless I kept the grass trim and neat . It should be my prize . " " Oh , my goodness ! " exclaimed the poor Elephant . " If there are to be more disputes , and more evidence in this case , I shall go mad . Stop ! " he cried , as the Wheelbarrow , the Hoe , and the Lawn Mower came forward , all talking at once . " Stop ! I will do nothing until I see the prize ! Court is adjourned ! " And as the Elephant said this the sound of loud barking sounded through the barn . " Oh , maybe that is Nip coming to carry me back , " thought the Elephant . " I certainly hope so ! " CHAPTER IX OUT IN THE RAIN You remember that Nip , the big dog , had carried away the Stuffed Elephant when Archie set his Christmas toy down on the barn floor for a moment . And , coming back , after having gone to look for the nest of a cackling hen , Archie did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Elsie ! " exclaimed the little boy . " Did n't I leave my Elephant right here ? " and he pointed to the place where he had set it . " Why , yes , I think you did , " Elsie answered . " I saw you put it there . I was going to leave my Doll there , too , but she is n't feeling very well , and has a little cold , so I carried her in my arms . I have her here now , " she added , as she held up her Christmas toy . " Well , my Elephant is gone ! " exclaimed Archie . " And I know I left it here ! Yes , you can see where his feet stood , " he added , as he pointed to some marks in the dust of the barn floor . Elsie , holding her Doll , stooped down beside her brother and looked at the dust . " There are lots of marks , " said the little girl . " Your Elephant must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , with shining eyes , " maybe he came to life and walked away ! " " Nope ! He could n't do that ! " Archie said . Of course he knew nothing of what the toys did after dark -- how they made believe come to life , talked , and had fun among themselves . " But now I know what has happened ! " Archie exclaimed . " I can tell by the marks in the dust . " " What did happen ? " asked Elsie . " Nip has been here , " went on the little boy . " I can tell his paw marks in the dust . It was n't my Elephant walking around , it was Nip ! And Nip has carried off my Elephant ! " " Oh , just as he did once with my old Rag Doll ! " cried Elsie . " That 's it ! " her brother said . " Nip has carried away my Elephant . Come here , Nip ! Where are you ? " called Archie . Now Nip was always ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy had many good times together , romping and playing tag in the yard . So , when he heard his name called , Nip came running into the barn to where Elsie and Archie were standing . " Nip ! " sternly said Archie , as he shook his finger at his big dog , " did you take my Elephant ? Did you carry him away ? " Now Nip understood a great deal that was said to him . He knew when he was being scolded for having done wrong , and he knew he was being scolded now . He also knew that he had taken away the Elephant . So , when Archie talked this way , Nip hung his head and put his tail between his legs . " Nip ! " went on Archie , " where is my Stuffed Elephant ? Go get it ! Bring back my Elephant ! Go on , Nip ! " Nip gave a little bark . He sprang up , barked again , louder than before , and off he ran to a dim and distant part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elephant ? " asked Elsie . " I hope so , " her brother answered . " We 'll follow him and see where he goes . " But Nip ran too fast for the children to follow . Down the stairs , into the dark corner of that part of the barn where the garden tools were kept , ran Nip . He knew he had been found out , and that he must bring back Archie 's Elephant . So , just as the Shovel , the Rake and the Pick had hurried away to look for the prize , and while the Wheelbarrow , the Hoe and the Lawn Mower were fussing to see why they could n't have a chance to win , Nip pounced down on the Elephant , lifted him up , and started back with him to Archie . " Oh , I 'm so glad you came to get me ! " said the Elephant . " I was just going to try to find my way back myself , for I have had a most dreadful time trying to settle a dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to be a Judge ! " Nip did not answer , because he had the Stuffed Elephant in his mouth . " I hope we are going to be friends , Mr. Nip , " went on the Elephant . " Please do n't carry me away again . " Nip wanted to say that he would not , for he felt sorry because of the trick he had played . But just then Elsie and Archie came running up , and the dog could not talk , nor could the Elephant pretend to be alive , for the eyes of the children were upon them . " Oh , he has my Elephant ! " joyfully cried Archie . " I guess you must have hidden him , Nip , for you knew where to find him ! Bring my Elephant here ! " Nip put the Elephant down on the barn floor at Archie 's feet , and then the dog wagged his tail . " He 's asking you to forgive him , " said Elsie . " And I will , " promised Archie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking his finger at Nip . " Bow wow ! " barked the dog , and perhaps that meant he would not . " Oh , I 'm so glad to have my Elephant back ! " said Archie , as he began playing with his toy . " And I 'm glad to be back , " thought the Elephant . " That Judge business was a great trial ! " Through the spring and into the summer Archie had fun with his Christmas Elephant . Then one day something very exciting happened . Archie was playing out in the back yard , near a little brook , with his Elephant , when along the front road came a hand-organ man and a monkey . Archie and his sister ran to hear the music and see the monkey , and Archie left his Elephant in the grass . Soon after this it began to rain very hard and the children hurried into the house . Going up the steps Archie fell and bumped his head , making his nose bleed , and there was so much excitement for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the storm , and the rain came down harder and harder , making little puddles and tiny brooks in the yard ; brooks that flowed into the large one . " Oh , this is dreadful ! " thought the poor Elephant , as the rain pelted down on him . " Of course if I was real I would n't mind the rain , for real Elephants like water . But I 'm getting soaking wet ! It 's beginning to come through my stuffing . I 'm feeling like a sponge ! " Oh , why does n't Archie come and get me , or at least give me an umbrella ! I think I 'll try to walk under a toadstool to keep out of the wet . If I can only find one large enough . " As no one was watching him , the Elephant had a chance to move about and make believe come to life . But he had waited too long . The rain had soaked into his cotton stuffing making him so heavy that now he could not move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . He tried to lift first one leg , then another , but it was hard work . The water was beginning to rise about him . His feet were in mud puddles . He struggled hard to pull them out , and then , all at once , he lurched to one side , and fell over flat -- right into a pool of water ! CHAPTER X A VOYAGE HOME Down pelted more and more rain , harder and harder , until the back yard , where Archie had been playing with the Stuffed Elephant , was almost a little lake of water . The puddle rose higher and higher around the Stuffed Elephant as he lay on his side , unable to move because he was so soaked with water -- like a sponge . Inside the house where Archie lived there was trouble , because the little boy was hurt worse in his fall than was at first supposed . They had to send for the doctor , and of course no one thought of the poor Elephant . " I 'm glad I 'm not out in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat at the window after the doctor had gone . " Yes , it is a regular flood , " said Mother , sadly thinking of her little boy . And still no one thought of the Elephant out in all the storm . If Elsie remembered anything at all , she probably thought that Archie had brought his Elephant into the house . As for Archie , the doctor had given him something to make him sleep , and the little boy was too ill even to dream of his Christmas toy . As for the Elephant ; well , he was in a sad state ! The wet cotton stuffing inside him was cold and clammy . His trunk was like a wet piece of paper , and he feared his wooden tusks would come out , if the glue that held them in got too much soaked . " Oh , dear ! What am I to do ? " thought the poor toy . Now it happened that Jeff , the colored boy who had once taken the China Cat from Mr. Mugg 's store after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeff and his folks had moved to the country from the city . And about this time Jeff 's mother sent him to the store . " Has Ah done got ta go in all dis rain ? " asked the little colored boy . " Yo ' suah has , Honey ! " replied his mother . " Yo ' is n't salt or sugah , an ' yo ' wo n't melt . Put on yo ' ole coat an ' go to de sto ' ! " So Jeff went . He took a " short cut " which led across the Dunn 's back yard , and Jeff passed the place where the poor Elephant lay in a puddle of water . " Oh , golly ! " cried Jeff , his white teeth glistening against his funny black face as he laughed . " Ah 'd done gone an ' found annuder playtoy ! Only dis one Ah done found in de rain , but de udder one was in a fiah ! Ah knows whut Ah 's gwine to do . I 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de sto ' . Den Ah 'll take him home wif me ! " Jeff looked around until he found a flat board , large enough to hold the elephant . Putting the toy on this board , Jeff laid it to one side , and ran on to the store . He did not want to take the Elephant with him for fear some one would see it and ask him about it . But Jeff was not to have that Elephant . While the colored boy was at the store the rain came down harder than ever , making so much water that the little brook in Archie 's back yard rose higher and higher . So high did the brook rise that the water reached the board on which the limp and soaking Elephant was lying on his side . And then the water lifted up the board , Elephant and all , and floated them down stream . " Oh , my ! " thought the poor Stuffed Elephant . " This is the last of me ! I am going on a long voyage ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he floated on the board which was like a boat . Once a fish poked his head out of the water and called : " Who are you and where are you going ? " Before the Elephant could answer the swift current had carried him farther downstream and away from the fish . Once the board with the Elephant on it bumped against a big Water Rat . " Be careful who you 're bumping ! " snarled the Rat . Illustration : " Be Careful Who You 're Bumping ! " Snarled the Rat . The Story of a Stuffed Elephant . Page 114 " Excuse me , " replied the Elephant . " I did n't mean to . " The Rat tried to bite the Elephant 's trunk , but again the swift current carried the boat downstream . Finally the rain stopped , after a day or so , but by that time the Elephant had been carried a long way down the brook , at last coming to a stop when the board was caught in the roots of an overhanging tree . By now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wet and soaking was he . The rain stopped , the brook went down , the sun came out , and the Elephant dried . But he still lay on the board , on the bank of the stream , under the roots of the tree . A man , who happened to be passing , saw the Elephant , picked him off the board , and , seeing that he was an expensive toy , took the plaything to his home . " What a fine Elephant ! " said the man 's wife . " I 'll put him on the mantel , over the stove , so he 'll dry out more . Some child lost this . We have n't any children small enough to want to keep it . I wish I could find out who owned this Elephant . " " I wish so , myself , " thought the Elephant . " Oh , shall I ever get back to Archie ? " It was a day or so after the big storm that Archie was able to be up and around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go outdoors , was his Elephant . " Oh , where is he ? " cried the little boy . " I ' member I left him in the yard when we heard the hand-organ music and ran to see the monkey . And then it rained and I fell down and bumped my nose . Oh , where is my Elephant ? " " If you left him out here in the yard I fear the Elephant has floated away , " said Mrs. Dunn . " The brook rose very high -- almost up to our back steps -- and it probably carried your Elephant away . " " Oh , shall I ever get him back ? " cried Archie , feeling sad . " I 'm afraid not , " his mother answered . Archie felt so bad about his toy that his father put an advertisement in the paper , asking whoever found the Elephant to please bring him back and get a reward . If Jeff , the colored boy , had been able to read , he might have seen the advertisement and have told what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . And , besides , it rained so hard when the colored boy went back from the store , after putting the Elephant on the board , that Jeff had to go home another way , and he forgot all about the stuffed plaything he had set aside . But the man who had taken the Elephant home read the paper , and he saw the advertisement Mr. Dunn put in . " There ! " called the man to his wife . " Now I know where that Elephant belongs . I 'll take him back to the little boy . " " Well , he 's good and dry , " said his wife . " I mean the Elephant is good and dry . He 's almost as good as new . " And , in fact , the Elephant was , for she had brushed off all the mud , and the heat had dried out the water . Carrying the Stuffed Elephant , the man who had found the toy took it to Archie 's house . " Oh , here he is ! My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , how glad I am ! " cried Archie , as he clasped the cotton creature in his arms . " Oh , how glad I am ! " " And I 'm glad , too ! " thought the Elephant . " I feared I would never see Archie and Elsie again ! And I 'm even glad to see Nip ! " for the dog came to the door , wagging his tail . And so , after several adventures , the Stuffed Elephant was back home again , but many more things happened to him , though I have no room for them in this book . The Elephant even acted again as Judge in the dispute of the Rake , the Shovel and the Pick , but who won the prize I can not tell . I think each should have had a prize . Do n't you ? Once again there was happiness in the Dunn house , for the lost Elephant was back , and Elsie gave her brother a pink ribbon to tie on his toy 's neck . " It may look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elephant , as Archie pulled him about . THE END THE STORY LADY SERIES By GEORGENE FAULKNER * * * * * =Illustrated .
