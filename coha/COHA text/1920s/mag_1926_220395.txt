Magnus accused Schall of having collected funds from bootleggers to finance his 1924 campaign . Magnus , in brief , wished to return to the Senate . After unanimous report of a subcommittee , the Senate last week voted-and there was no opposition-vindicating Schall , declaring him entitled to his seat . When the vote had been taken with no opposition , it was agreed not to print the record of committee hearings . <P> Then Senator Schall rose . He is in his 50th year , the son of David and Mary Ellen Schall and has been practicing law in Minnesota since he was graduated from St. Paul College of Law in 1904 .

Not having it , I would like to borrow the eyes of the clerk for a few minutes in order that the statement may go into the RECORD . " <P> The Vice President . " Does the Senator desire to have the clerk read the statement ? " <P> Mr. Schall . " I do . " <P> Then the clerk began to read : " Mr. President , the so-called contest has ended in the only way it could end . It never had any basis , in fact , and was manifestly political from the beginning .

The framers of this persecution expected no positive results except to hold me with it while they attracted public attention and smeared me with their slime . . . . <P> " Donald Hughes , well known in Minneapolis as a conscienceless shyster , was placed in charge of the case because of his cunning ratlike tendencies and his extensive association with crooks and perjurors , for I leave it to the committee if any real lawyer , knowing the facts , would have touched the case .
