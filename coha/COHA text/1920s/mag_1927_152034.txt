Signor Benito Mussolini 's Cabinet passed a series of decrees last week compelling all Italian landlords to reduce rents on their properties by July 1 , 1927 , thus : <P> 1 ) 15% on apartments of not more than five rooms ; <P> 2 ) 10% on apartments of more than five rooms and less than nine rooms ; <P> 3 ) 20% on the premise 's of shops selling " foodstuffs and household necessities " ; <P> 4 ) 10% on stores in which " luxury merchandise " is sold . <P> Significance . When Signor Mussolini became Premier , five years ago , he found building at a standstill , due to the restrictions imposed by previous regimes upon landlords . The Fascist regime immediately removed these restrictions , and building has progressed rapidly in consequence . Now Premier Mussolini 's new restrictions , supplementing others of a less drastic character ( TIME , May 2 ) , tend to pinch the very landlords who responded to his earlier appeals for rapid building . Did Il Duce , then , trick as well as pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , declared that , by raising and stabilizing the gold value of the lira ( TIME , Sept. 13 ) , Signor Mussolini has made the new ( lower ) rentals which must be accepted by landlords worth as much ( in gold ) as the rentals they have been allowed to charge thus far .
