Somebody has sent broadcast through the Stkte card calling on Democrats to vote in the Republican primaries . If this becomes generally known among Republican voters it will be a boomerang of the worst kind , for partisanship rune high in Indiana . The resentment it will arouse will surety take away many Johnson votes . On the other hand , the gain by a *heavy Democratic vote in the Republican primary might overbalance any Republican defection . The appeal to Democrats is based nominally on their assumed opposition to the League of-Nations . But the circular goes much further than a mere appeal . It gives explicit directions to Democrats about ? tow to swear in their votes in case they are challenged as not members of the Republican Party . It directs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bound to accept , stating that they expect to vote the Republican ticket . There is nothing ? to prevent them from changing ' their minds the ' minute after . The appeal is printed on cardboard the size of a post card and " la being mailed to Democrats in all pii , rte of the State . The cards are not signed. / ' They urge Democrats to vote for , 1 , Johnson solely on the ground that he Is a foe of the League of Nations . Tau . TIMES correspondent is informed that a number of well-known Democrats are active Johnson 's behalf . One of the men named is the Postmaster of a large Indiana city . When this Postmaster was asked why he was working for Johnson he is said to have replied : " Because we want you Republicans to nominate him . " " Why ? " " Because we think we can beat him easily .

" An Invitation to Perjury . " The effort to get Democrats to go into the Republican primary on Tuesday and vote for Johnson will he denounced editorially tomorrow morning by the Indianapolis Star as an invitation to perjure themselves in behalf of the California candidate . The Star , under the caption " Republicans , Be On Guard , " will say : ' " The eleventh hour appeal of Hiram W. Johnson supporters to Indiana Democrats asking them to perjure themselves in order to help to nominate him should arouse Republicans to the desperate character of the campaign that is being waged in an effort to capitalize the Catifornian 's opposition to the League ofNations . " Cards were mailed out on Saturday calling on Democrats to vote for Johnson at the primary tomorrow , ' Even if you voted the Democratic ticket in the past : the Democrats arc told : ' if challenged , make affidavit at the polling place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket neat November . This will enable you to v9te for Johnson . ' " The aim evidently is to get the support of the hyphenate element among the Democrats who might be influenced to support Johnson by his appeal , ' He kept us . out of : the League of Nations . ' The absence of contests in the Democratic primaries is ? counted upon to make it easy to Induce members of that party to support Johnson in the hope of being able to dominate the will of the Republican voters in a Republican primary . It confirms . the suspicion and contention that Johnson 's vote in Michigan , . New Jersey and other States has not been a measure of his Republican strength nor an indication of what might be expected for him in November , if nominated . " It is not surprising ' that Johnson would hope for support from Democrats who are opposed to the League , but it scarcely was expected they would be asked to perjure themselves in order to try to carry the State primaries for him . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote for a majority of the Republican ticket next November . Does any one believe that an honest Democrat who would like to see Johnson foisted on the Re .. publican Party intends to repudiate the President , slaughter leis own candi- dates for Governor , for Congress . for State- and county offices , and to opaore Torn Taggart for the sake of , helping Johnson ? Any Democrat who does not Intend to do that and is urged to vote for . Johnson is asked to perjure himThe Republican voters of Indiana should not mistake the " situation . They are confronted by an effort at having their nominee named by the opposition party while they are dividing their strength among three very admirable ram and worthy candidates . " Plainly , it is the duty of Republicans interested in seeing a Republican nominated by Republican voters to get together on the strongest man they have to defeat Johnson . That man undoubtedly is Leonard Wood . If Johnson is defeated tomorrow it will be by Wood , . If Johnson wins tomorrow it will be because Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue for Reliubliean4 is clear . Do you want a Republican chosen by Republican voters and representing the Republican party , or do you Want a. man bearing , a Republican label and backed by the - disgruntled elements supporting the principles of no party ? " Senator Johnson 's managers are now ( after midnight Monday Morning ) in conference and it IS believed that they are trying to find a way to answer the editorial article in the Star .

Johnson is not likely to get any , and if lie does it will not be more than four out of . the thirty . The Senator though confident of getting a plurality , is not at all pleased with this outlook , and is preparing to put : ' up the bitterest kind of a fight against it . Though the law declares that a mere plurality has no effect and does not express the choice of the State , and though in that case the State Convention ? ' is legally entitled to disretiard the .

If it Were anybody-but Johnson they would not-feel uneasy , but they are aware that Johnson is a wildcat in a fight and has an astonishing way of keeping the other man busy with both hands . They fear that the kind of fight he is capable of putting . up might damage the machine beyond repair . The Lowden men are not much cast down by the discovery - they have belatedly made that their candidate can not run better than third in the primary .
