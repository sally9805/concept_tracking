The post office of the District of Columbia must have been a bit rushed on the morning of Jan. 1 , because on New Year 's eve someone went to numerous postboxes and dumped in 600,000 letters . <P> The 600,000 letters contained 600,000 insurance policies dated Jan. 1 , 1925 , and addressed to 600,000 men who served in the Army , Navy and Marine Corps during the War . So was the payment of the second bonus begun . So far , about 2,000,000 applications have been filed . Of these , 400,000 were returned because not properly made out ( lacking signatures , etc . ) . Only about 15,000 applications were disallowed on the grounds that there was no valid claim . It is estimated that there are some 1,000,000 veterans of the Army alone who have not applied for their bonuses . The applications are coming in in increasing numbers , at a present rate of about 12,000 a day . <P> Those entitled to $50 or less bonus credit will not be paid until Mar. 1 or later , if their applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 checks have been prepared for mailing on that day . <P> The time for making applications does not expire until Jan. 1 , 1928.
