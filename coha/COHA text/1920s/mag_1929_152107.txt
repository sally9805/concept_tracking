There are some perfectly harmless words which an English gentleman can not come right plump out with . Reporters covering the Conservative Party keynote speech , delivered last week by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin in Drury Lane Theatre , noticed that he paused perceptibly and shifted his shoulders the merest trifle in the middle of the following sentence : " I come now to the subject of pause maternity .

Proposals therefore are under consideration for making available , for insured women and the uninsured wives of insured husbands , proper medical and midwifery services during pregnancy and childbirth , and to have more cash payments on confinement . " <P> In scholarly conclusion Mr. Baldwin prophesied that the Conservative Party would be returned to power after the election " by the same majority which Disraeli received in 1874 .
