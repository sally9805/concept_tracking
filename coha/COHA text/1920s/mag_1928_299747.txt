The dread , slow-spreading famine in Shantung and adjoining provinces ( TIME , Feb. 6 ) had pushed 150,000 Chinese to the brink of Death , last week , put 300,000 into a condition of " agonizing starvation , " and rendered 1,000,000 stomachs light if not quite empty . <P> These figures , approximate , were issued by Manhattan 's China Famine Relief Fund Committee , plus the warning that contributions must be made soon or too late . <P> Secretary Earl Baker , of the Committee , cabled from Shanghai , last week , that the myriads of grasshoppers which partially caused the famine by devouring crops are now being devoured in turn by famished humans . Fat grasshoppers are fought for .
