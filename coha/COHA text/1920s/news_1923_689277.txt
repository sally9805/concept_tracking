txt A dispatch from Havana yesterday carried a denial by President ZATAS that the Platt amendment and the treaty between the United States and Cuba had been " broadened in scope . " Reports that negotiations to that end were under way had created a certain uneasiness among Cubans , and , in order to allay it , the President of Cuba gave public assurance that there was no thought of adding anything to " the stipulations of the Platt amendment . " There is no occasion to add anything . The Platt amendment , incorporated as it Is into the Constitution of Cuba , together with the explicit pledges given at the time of the transfer of the Government by the United States Military authorities , affords ample ground for American intervention in . alaa- whenever it may be necessary ' AT the purpose of maintaining a stable clovernment or for protecting the lives and property of Americans or citizens of foreign countries . The United States does not , In set terms , exercise a protectorate over Cuba . Yet it is Undeniable that Cuban sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty-making power of the Cuban Government is restricted . So is its power to contract public debts . In case of an attempt by the Cuban Government , through the forms of the law or otherwise , to confiscate American property in the island , the United States has reserved to itself a special right to intervene . Under the general principles of international law , it can and does lodge protests with Russia or Mexico against confiscatory measures directed against Americans , but in Cuba it has a special warrant for taking steps to protect Its own citizens . The official documents which establish this peculiar right have been brought together in a brief prepared by a law firm representing several sugar companies which allege that they are threatened with confiscation by the so-called Tarafa bill , now pending before the Cuban Congress . Into the merits of that particular controversy it is not at present necessary to enter . It is to be hoped that the representations of our State Department will lead the Cuban Government to head off the bill or to make needful Modifications of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73ut on the main question of the duty as well as of the right of the United States Government to intervene in Cuba , for good cause shown , the brief In Question masses the evidence in Conclusive fashion . First of all , we have the duty of the United States under the treaty of peace with Spain to assume and discharge , during the military occupation of Cuba , all the obligations that might arise under international law for the " protection of life and property . " In the same treaty it is provided that the United States , upon the termination tpf its own military occupancy , would ? advise any Government established 0 ' in the island to assume the same I " obligations . " , It was in order to live up to this promise that the Platt amendment was adopted . Furthermore , by direction of the Secretary of ' War of the United States , in the official act of Aiding the military Government of Cuba and transferring it to the Cuban Government , there was an express provision , amounting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume and undertake " all and several the obligations as " sumed by the United States with 11 ' respect to Cuba . " Thus the legal basis for American Intervention in Cuba , when due occasion arises , is secure . The Cubans themselves do not question - it . The ' peiairflins of the two countries stand In a special category . Our Government has in this case more than the rights guaranteed by international law . It enjoys specific and contractual rights in Cuba . That the need to exercise them may be infrequent all must hope . It is clear that the authorities in Washington would be reluctant to proceed under them in a way to hurt the pride of the Cuban Government . Yet if a clear and exigent demand presented itself , there can be no doubt that our Government would take steps . under the authority it has in law and treaties , to see to it that the lives and property of Americans in Cuba . or of other foreigners resident there . are fully protected .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
