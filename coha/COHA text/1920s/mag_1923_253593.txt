" Throw Them Out " <P> Nathaniel A. Elsberg was elected to a second term as President of the National Republican Club . In accepting the re-election he made a pointed little speech . Said he : " I want to see the time , and that soon , when men who have been elected by Republican votes and supported by Republican newspapers and who call themselves Republicans , but who at every opportunity assail a Republican administration , President and Cabinet , are thrown out of the Republican party and over into the Democratic party , where they belong . I have particular reference to Senators La Follette , Borah and Johnson ! "
