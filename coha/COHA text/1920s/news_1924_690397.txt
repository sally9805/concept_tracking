txt If this section is typical of all Kansas , Mr. Capper will not return to the Senate . The reaction to his farm bk.c policies , based on the supposition that the farmers are hopelessly ignorant , is coming in strong . He has tried to fool all the farmers all the time , and it begins to look as if he has failed in the attempt . I am in the southwest corner of Kansas in a part of what , in my early school days , was the " Great American Desert . " Monday I drove about 100 miles north and east of this town ( Dodge City ) , and yesterday about 150 miles south and west . About 100 miles of yesterday 's travel represented actual inspection and the other 50 the drive home after the work was done . I find a wonderful crop of high grade wheat here . I have been in fields that will yield 30 , 35. 40 and some 45 bushels to the acre . One would be justified in refusing to believe this . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; but I have seen it . You can imagine what effect this will have on butiness and even on the Presidential vote . I have been in innumerable wheat fields , and several grain elevators ; talked with farmers , elevator men , grain dealers and bankers : all are happy as boys in a swimming hole . An enormous wheat crop with a farm price of about a dollar a bushel is enough to make a sailor turn from grumbling . I talked with one man who had 1.400 acres of wheat on his farm . He and his 15-year-old son put in 700 acres themselves , paying out but $20 for outside help . From that he will have more than 20,000 bushels . While I was there a grain man was ' trying to buy it around $1 a bushel . The other 700 acres was put in by a tenant on shares . From the whole thing he should clean up $15,000 . I was in another smaller field  --  a quarter section of 160 acres  --  which was being cut and threshed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $1 a bushel , and will yield over 42 bushels to the acre . The owner paid $5.000 , or less than $40 an acre , for his land last year . His net return should pay 75% of the cost of the land . Just remember these things when the agitator talks of the bankrupt farmers . Political sentiment is difficult to describe . A bank cashier said that the western Congressmen should be stood in a row and shot . After expressing this amiable opinion he said that he had unlimited confidence in Coolidge and did not favor a changed administration . I think that fairly expresses the weight of opinion out here ; it is hostile to everything connected with this last Congress , but friendly toward Coolidge . The politicians are losing in favor with the people , who see now that legislation can not cure their troubles .. The flat failure of the measures that have been put through in the past three years , for their " relief " has opened their eyes . They scoff at the much praised Cap- , per grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same cashier I have referred to was talking with me about credit conditions . He said that any farmer who was entitled to credit could get all he needed at any time . The War Finance Corporation , the Federal Land Bank and the Rural Intermediate Credit Bank were unnecessary , and were no more than " bunk . " The farmers themselves are beginning to regard the tariff and the European situation as vital to their welfare . Politics has nothing to do with their views . They look upon these questions from what they conceive to be an economic viewpoint in which they are directly interested . The tariff on farm products is regarded as a political trick to fool them ; the tariff on manufactured goods is regarded as too high and , with high wages bears unjustly on them ; freight rates on farm products are too high to item , and should be adjusted by lowering on farm products and increasing on some others ; they do not want the railroads destroyed . They are taking a surprising interest In the foreign situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and that a reparation settlement would help them . They know what they want , but not how to get it . They do not care how it is done or by whom , but do want it accomplished . You can not give them too much information on this subject . In writing with a view to teaching the people of this section it is well to remember that they are different from many of La Follette 's followers . Most of the people here are of the same racial stock that peopled New England , and bolshevism does not run in their blood .
