Admirer of the famed Gary system of secondary education wondered what connection there might be , if any , between that system and last week 's strike of 1,357 pupils at the Emerson High School in Gary , Ind . The immediate details of the strike had greater racial than educational significance ( see RACES , p. 12 ) . <P> The Gary system was installed by Superintendent William Albert Wirt , who last week was obliged to deal with the strikers . The system consists in a year-round school schedule for the purpose of fully utilizing school equipment ; and in elective courses , elective vacations , informal grading and self-discipline-to promote mental initiative . In last week 's strike , pupils who had presumably been thoroughly Garyized for the past several years , took the law into their own hands . Students of the Gary system recalled that one criticism of it was that it would decrease teachers ' influence over pupils .
