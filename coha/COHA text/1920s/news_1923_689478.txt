txt Governor Pinchot of Pennsylvania , as the chief speaker today befere the Citizenship Conference here , called upon President Coolidge to take personal charge of the enforcement of national prohibition , as President Washington had taken charge of law enforcement in the days of the whisky rebellion in Pennsylvania . In his speech , which he read with deliberation , the Governor , who is making prohibition a leading issue en Pennsylvanis. , handled the subject without mincing words . He declared that Federal officials were encouraging the breaking of the law and that the Federal authorities were responsible for illegal liquor coming into the country , while some enforcement officials were acting as graft collectors . Governor Pinchot suggested that the law could not be enforced until the prohibition enforcement service was taken out of politics . Says Law Is Flouted in Washington . " Not only has the political hamstringing of the Federal enforcement service had its seat in Washington , " he said .

Some of those Nvho listened to th , - speech read into it an appeal to the dry forces for the campaign which Governoe Pinchot may make for the Republican nomination for President in the event that Mr. Coolidge does not emerge from the next Congress with a record which will assure his nomination . Governor Pinchot was told of this interpretation and asked whether he was a candidate for the Presidency . He smiled and denied that the speech had any bearing upon his political fortunes .

Governor Pinchot read his speech , and did not depart from his manuscript except to pay several compliments to Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , Assistant Attorney General in charge of the prosecution of prohibition and tax laws . At the end he exclaimed : " We are going to clean up the United States . " Governor Pinchot 's Speech . Governor Pinchot said in his speech : " Two facts stand out in the confused and troubled enforcement situation of today . One is the steadily increasing determination of decent people to have the law enforced . The other is the steadily increasing violation of the law by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason for the latter is not far to seek . " The Eighteenth Amendment has been betrayed in the house of its friends . Measured by the respect accorded to it , it has failed , and the reason is that no sincere , intelligent , and concerted nation-wide effort has ever been made to enforce it . " We all know the proof of that . It is found in the ease with which great quantities of liquor are being smuggled into this country ; in the huge amounts of bogus whisky manufactured from denatured alcohol , and in the continuing sale of high power beer from the breweries in truck load and carload lots . " It is idle to suggest that the law can not be enforced . That the Government of the United States , the most powerful nation on earth , with the people overwhelmingly behind it . is powerless before a few thousand , or a few hundred thousand , of assorted law breakers is simply unthinkable . The fact is we have never really tried . The essential reasop why bootlegging and defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IA because this particular nettle has ever been grasped with a strongrend . " The thing that has pr tected the liquor criminal from the law is politics . Politics first , law enforceehent a poor second , has been the orders Bad whisky , with beer to help , has supplied the sinews of war for bad politics , and politics has returned the favor . . ? Dike i'enneyieenia , for t xample. assume that the story of Federal lave enforcement in Pennsylvania is not ese sentially different from the same store in other States . Until the present State Administration came Into power the Commonwealth itself did little or nothing . Under the Federal Government our first and second Prohibition Directors in Pennsylvania were Democrats selected for political reasons . To spread the mantle of charity over them , it may he said that they went out of office without having advanced the cause they were supposed to champion . Calls Appointment a Scandal . - The third Director was the notorious McConnell , a politician known to be opposes to tee Eighteenth Amendment when he was appointee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was promptly followed by the release on alleged fraudulent permits of many hundreds of thousands of gallons of whisky , and a little later by his own indictment and that of a number of his assistants for such release . " SsleConnelrs performance was precisely what must have been looked for by any one who knew him . It is difficult not to believe that What he did was expected and intended by the power to which his appointment was due . - After McConnell , the next Director made a record which offers no chance for praise . The next was of a wholly dif:erent character , but tie was removed when his work had scarcely begun . " The present Director . Ma ; or G. Murdock , Is the first in the history of enforcement in Pennsylvania to whom the State may look for real results . Major Murdock and Mr. Sams , one of his colleagues in the enforcement work in Eastern Pennsylvania ( I do not know the enforcement officer in Western Pcrineylvania. , of whom I hear excellent eports ) , have given convincing evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in compelling respect for the Constitution and laws of the United States . " Unfortunately , they are handicapped because the most elementary principles of good business management have been disregarded in the organization of the Government enforcement work . I refer . ' for example , to the unwise division of authority , to the fact that both of them arc compelled to do their work through ' agents . of whose history and connections they have no knowledge and in whose Selection they have no voice , and under rules and regulations framed at Washington , which often fail wholly to meet local conditions . " Under this system , born and bred in politics , it is commonly believed , and T share that belief , that certain agents of the Federal Department not only wink at the violation of the law , but have served or are serving as collectors of the $6 or $7 a barrel graft money paid by brewers for immunity . This belief receives strong confirmation when a brewery is caught bribing State Policemen , who were promptly both discharged from the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that high power beer Is manufactured and sold throughout the State by the illegal operation of breweries holding Federal licensee . P.artenders openly boast to saloon patrons of the real beer thee its good quality and high alcoholic content . Freedom From Politics Demanded . " The Federal Enforcement Service in Pennsylvania lost its soul through politics and will never be worth its salt until it is taken wholly out of politics . That is the first step in my State , and , infer , In the others also . " The second , in my judgment , is to make the head of it , until the present . situation is . cleaned up , responsible directly to the President of the United States . Under the existi organization the line of authority leads from the President to the Secretary of the Treesnry , from him to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue , and from the Commissioner to various subordinates . What is needed is an organization in which responsibility is definitely centred : one in which the buck can not be passed . and over which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . ? ' The bootleggers , the lawless saloon men and the brewers are the head and front of the army of criminals in Americe . All these facts taken together furnish abundant reason for treating this matter as of sufficient importance to enlist the active direction of the President himself . He is the only man who an bring together in harmonious effect Ire action all the necessary Government forces . He alone , in my opinion , can meet the present emergency . Sees New Whisky Rebellion . ' These brewers , bootleggers. and saloon keepere have made a larger issue Ian that between wets and drys . Ti. have thrown down the gauntlet to all law under the Government of the United States . They defy our Constitution and our laws as did their ancestors , the outlaws of the Whisky Rebellion of Washington 's time . Washington . in that emergency , took personal charge of seeing that the law was respected as supreme and was prepared to use all the powers of the Government , if neceesary , to make it so . Ills example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tortes . ' There is another reason why the ' resident should take personal charge . Not only has the political hamstringing of the Federal Enforcement Service had its seat in Washington . but it is notori ( Ws that disobedience to the Eighteenth mei-eh/lent has been flagrant in the capital City . Stories are innumerable of the active practice and encouragement of law breaking by officials high in the Government of the United States . We can not expect other communities to I respect and obey the law if the capital of the nation itself is a leader among lei w breakers . Washington has set the bad example , and it is for Washington to repair the damage . " Pennsylvania is doing its level best with the means It has . What we have done is simple . We have merely used the powers we had in an honest and , I believe , an intelligent effort to enforce tl. law . Fight to a Finish Promised . - Of one thing you may be sure : This is a fight to a finish . There will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . The bootleggers will be beaten and law and order will win . Have no fear about that . " For years the liquor power and the Republican party were sloe partners in Pennsylvania . For years the liquor power and the Democratic party were aide partners in New York . For years liquor has paid the bills for the dominant party in State after State throughout the nation . Their connection is too recent to be forgotten . In county after county in Pennsylvania illegal liquor still keeps the gang alive . That is one more reason why we must insist on the complete separation of politics from the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment .  - -  The issue is clear before us and the outcome is assured . No band of etiminals ever has or ever will defeat our CoNcrnment and our people . We are going to win and win completely , be , ause they are wrong and we are right . They that fight with us are many times more than they that fight with our , , nemies . " Mrs. Willebrandt Tells of Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines as Governor Pinchot . She . too , suggested that there ought to be a better organization of the enforcement agencies , and intimated that the President ought e0 be more directly responsible for the enforcement of this law . Mrs. Willebrandt U.-Ad of an Ohlo bootlegger who started business with $6,000 and in thirteens-Months , when he was ' nt to jail for IWO pears , had accumulated more than ... 3,000,000 . " I have a copy , " she said . " of a letter dated Augitgt 1:S. afeas.written by Lieut . Col. Sir Broderick HiartaVell , a the Yeoman Houses al . Haymarket . London , England . He offers to sell stock and guarantees that he will pay 20 per cent . profit every sixty days on every bit of capital invested . He says that he is shipping cases of whisky abroad to be sold within 20 miles from the American shore : that he can arrange for the sale of 10,000 cases per month . Tie adds . ' this means a large fortune in which you can participate ' without risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says ; " ' Please understand this is not a smuggling expedition , neither does it in any way conflict with the laws of England or any other country . I sell my goods at sea to ' hose buyers who come alongside to purchase . Some buyers , as can be seen by reference to the enclosed : lipping , cover the distance from the sea vessels to New York in less than two hours . " Now let this sink into your mind . The mouth of the Hudson River , up et-hjsat these motor vessels travel laden with whisky , is no wider in places than Ur , Thames , and one revenue vessel stationed midway in the river could stop ? ?  --  ? all spirits from entering New York City . yet 1,800,000 cases of whisky are said to have entered New York last year .
