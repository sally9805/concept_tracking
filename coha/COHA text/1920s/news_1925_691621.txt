txt The complaint that figures can be made to prove anything applies to the ' statistics of immigration . The impresision given in yesterday 's papers that more workers left the United States during the first ten months of the current immigration year than came into it deserves closer examination than it received from most readers . It was stated that 27,908 " unskilled laborers " were admitted from July , 1924 , to April , 1925 , whereas 44,750 " laborers " departed , leaving an actual deficit of 16,482 . On the face of it this indicates a serious loss . Such a conclusion , however , ignores the fact that most immigrants when applying for admission give ' as their occupation that which they hope to follow on arrival , rather than in which they are actually experienced . Many who come listed as unskilled laborers soon graduate into other classes of work . whereas others capable , of only unskilled labor list themselves as belonging to a specialized trade . So far as the outgoing " laborers " are concerned , much depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final figures establishing this point will not be available for some months . But two tendencies may be noted  --  first , that ever since immigration restriction has been in force the number of departing aliens not intending to return to this country has been small compared to the years before restriction , and , secondly , that as the aliens here have become more familiar with the details of the new law permitting them to be readmitted if they go home for a visit , the number ' of temporary departures has steadily increased . More applications have been received at Ellis Island for temporary visits to Europe during the first three weeks of June than in any corresponding period of time since the new law went into effect . If the final statistics for the first year of the immigration restriction law should actually show that the number of laborers permanently returning to Europe exceeded the nuthber arriving in this country , it would be an interesting commentary on the claims of those who have asserted that the restriction of immigration would so curtail the supply of labor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens having " made their pile " to return home , it is hard to believe that they would leave in large numbers if the demand for their labor was acute . They would be tempted to linger for a few months in order to profit by the high wages which they ? could command . The outstanding result of the new immigration law is thedrastic reduction in the total number of aliens lawfully admitted into the United States this year as compared with last . Present indications are that the decrease will be in the neighborhood of 70 per cent . This , of course , makes no allowance for " bootlegged " immigrants . Presumably , the greater the ' legal restrictions the larger the number of illegal entries . There are still hundreds of thousands of Europeans determined to come to the United States . Those that cap are willing to come legally . But many others are not bothered by scruples . Thus the check on the admission of aliens is not so drastic as would appear from the immigration statistics , taken by themselves .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
