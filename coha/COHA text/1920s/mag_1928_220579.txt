PARACHUTE - Ramon Guthrie - Harcourt Brace ( $2 ) . <P> The Story . On the shores of Lake Undega in New York State is Berkenmeer . Its Main Street has a gaudy haberdashery shop , but there are also ancient elm trees that once sheltered a tougher tribe of Yankees . Arthur Gordon , a descendant , is the grand vizier of Berkenmeer . With an air of detached gentility , he saw to it that " the hay was got in from the golf links before a thunder shower , dances were run off with no deficit , horses were not frightened " by steamrollers . . . . " An ebullient Rotary had begun to suspect him of not being a big enough booster . But such heresy was momentarily dispelled after the World War when he invited the U. S. Government to fill his family-memorial hospital with convalescing aviators , who were able to play golf and give the town girls a treat . <P> By a nasty trick of war , a " big Wop from Peoria , " Tony Rickey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a bootblack . In youth , he founded the National Bug-Killer Co. , which rented to thousands of farmers , by mail , a machine guaranteed to kill each &; every insect or worm . The machine consisted of two blocks of wood- " you put the bug you wanted to kill on one block and squashed him with the other . " Rental $2 . Tony disappeared when the Postoffice got inquisitive , and left Deacon Miscombe holding the bag . In War , Aviator Tony annoyed a German sausage balloon and shot down a Fokker plane with the words : " Jeeze , what 'd you want to pick on me for ? " <P> Tony came to the Berkenmeer hospital with an injured arm which , it was tacitly understood among the golfing-aviators , would not prevent him from breaking anyone 's jaw . But " Berkenmeer was meant for ' officers and gentlemen , ' as the phrase ran " ; so , acting on an inverse snobbism , Tony kept to himself . The only man with whom Tony had anything in common-they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and war-shocked aviator , who thought out loud because he liked to hear himself think . He was the kind of a man who reads the Apocalypse and Alice in Wonderland in the same afternoon . Most people , including his family , thought him to be insane . But to Tony , he was a friendly , boundless genius . <P> Tony also encountered talent of another type-Natalie , the wife of Arthur Gortion . She was a Russian noblewoman of dark , warm beauty . Gortion had begun to look on her as an indiscretion of his youth ; she locked her door at night and saw little of him or of the townsfolk . So it was natural that Natalie and Tony , both out of place in Berkenmeer society , should become illicit lovers . One day , Tony took her away . He obtained money from Berkenmeer boosters , hostile to Gortion , to form an aviation company . Natalie and he went barnstorming at county fairs , grabbing quick lunches , flying recklessly , with contempt for gaping yokels . Later , Sayles joined them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sayles , lonely , asked an institutional woman named Adrienne to join the troupe as his wife ; she told him that he was too insane to marry anyone . He brooded ; committed suicide by the simple process of jumping from Tony 's airplane without a parachute .
