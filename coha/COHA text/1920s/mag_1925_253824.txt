" I feel certain that surtaxes will be reduced and have no doubt that the surtax will be brought down to 25 per cent and perhaps less . . . . Nobody can tell definitely how much we can reduce taxes next session until after the June payments are made and the returns are examined . " So the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee - so Reed Smoot of Utah . <P> Mr. Smoot is not the son of a prophet , but he is the man who said two years ago : " As sure as God lives and the sun rises in the morning , there will be a soldier bonus law passed by the next Congress . " <P> In Alabama , Senator Oscar W. Underwood addressed the Alabama Tax Clubs at Montgomery . Said he : <P> " If I had the power to write the tax law , I would go back to the tax of 1916 , where the highest bracket of the surtax was 13% . " <P> Senator Underwood is facing a very dubious chance of relection next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whither he expects to retire in due time . Some conjectured that he is making a last effort to rally support . Yet Senator Glass of Virginia recently advocated a 20% maximum surtax and ether Democrats , in spite of their last year 's opposition to the Mellon plan , seem to be edging towards a compromise with lower surtaxes . <P> The latest estimate of the Treasury is that there will be a surplus of $120,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30 . This surplus will , as usual , be used in reducing the short-dated debt-that is , Treasury Certificates , etc. , falling due will be redeemed without others being issued against them . <P> Some politicians , many of whom are especially interested in the Congressional elections in 1926 , propose to add this surplus to an expected surplus next year , making a combined " surplus " of $400,000,000 or more , and are talking of a " half a billion dollar tax cut . " They also propose personal exemptions of $5,000 and abolition of all " nuisance " taxes . <P> The Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $300,000,000 - and wants this reduction made principally in surtaxes and estate taxes . <P> <P> The Treasury reported , last week , the income taxes filed last year ( which were on incomes in 1923 ) : <P> The taxes totaled $703,962,165 ( as compared to $861,057,308 the year previous ) . The decrease was due to the flat reduction of 25% made in that year 's taxes . <P> The total of the incomes on which taxes were paid was $26,336,337,843 ( five billion greater than the previous year , three billion greater than the previous highwater mark in 1920 ) . <P> The number of persons paying income taxes was 7,698,321 ( 910,840 more than in the previous year ) . <P> The number of $1,000,000 or more incomes reported was 74 . ( Previously it had been : 1914. . 60 1915. .120 1916. .206 1917. .141 1918. . 1919. . 65 1920. . 33
