A SCORE of supposedly well-educated men and women were asked to which figure the distance from Petrograd to Vladivostok was nearest-400 miles , 1,400 miles , 4,000 miles , 14,000 miles . Eight did not answer at all . Two answered 400 miles ; two gave other wrong answers . They were asked whether the product of a+b and u ? b was a2-2ab-Fb2 , a2 ? W , 2a ? ab-l-b2 , or a ( a2 ? b2 ) . Two answered correctly . Eleven did not answer at all . Seven gave wrong answers . They were asked whether the two words in each of these pairs meant nearly the same or nearly the opposite : since ? before ; bankrupt ? solvent ; incumbent ? obligatory ; sucduct ? concise . Only half had the four correct , and seven made actual errors . These were leading business and professional men and their wives . The readers of Harper 's Magazine probably represent the top one or two per cent . of our population in respect to education , but if they will spend two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 1.6 ; add e and subtract 1.392010 from 7.040201 ; subtract from A , they will show only about half success . One in four of them will not know whether the Ten Commandments are called the decagon or the decalogue or the decament or the decemvirate ; or whether light travels in jagged , straight , or wavy lines . A man need not be ashamed to confess ignorance of such matters , perhaps . One can live happily and usefully not knowing whether Vladivostok is a city , a Bolshevik general , or a college fraternity . For a man to be half-educated in the sense that only a part of him is educated is a relatively innocent defect , provided the man is himself aware of it . When an uneducated part of him needs education he can be aware of the fact and provide for it . For a man to think his errors are knowledge or to Jack all sense of sure distinction between knowledge and ignorance is a more serious matter . One who really thinks that solvent means bankrupt will be misled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate who is sure that ( a+b ) X ( a ? b ) =2a2 ? ab ? b2 will probably be willing to be sure that black is white , or that war is profitable , or that all the troubles of the present are due to the Democratic party ( or the Republican party , if his predilections direct ) . Such a man is often only half-educated all over . In the face of the details and complexities of modern science and technology and art , it is the fate of all to be half-educated in the sense of having large areas of mind uncultivated , many problems answered only by a question mark . And such has always been the fate of the great majority of men . There is nothing new , and no great public danger in this . We have only in such cases to turn to the doctor , lawyer , engineer , priest , or other specialist who does know . The world has , even in its most successful epochs , got along with its population half-educated , or more truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , as the man 's mind is incompetent all over , in proportion as he has in general only an amateurish semi-knowledge and does not realize its inferiority , there is public THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE HALF-EDUCATED MAN G67 danger . Such a man is likely to try ( and fail ) to understand the specialist instead of obeying him . He does not " know his place " intellectually . He knows enough to criticize and abandon the customs of his fathers , but not enough to preserve their merits or to improve their defective parts . He maintains only a pseudo-independence of mind , being at the mercy of clever charlatans who have an interest in misleading him . The psychology of such half-educated men and women is perhaps especially instructive al this time , for there are so many of them . There seem to be more than the world has ever had to endure at any one time , though this may be only an appearance . At all events , they represent an intellectual inefficiency and perversion whose cure and prevention arc a main part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not actually increased in America in the generation past , they have at least not decreased in proportion to the increase in general leisure and the spread of public education . Let us consider , then , this disease of half-education , pseudo-intelIect , " fake " thinking . One of its main features is a belief in magic . Although the great majority of the half-educated would indignantly deny that they believed in alchemy , witchcraft , fairies , or elves , down deep in their make-up there is an active , if unconscious , faith in magic , an expectation that you may with good hick occasionally " beat the game , " a willingness to excuse yourself for failure on the ground that " things went against you , " a superstition that chance can be induced to favor you this time . A mother says , " I do n't see why Mary caught the whooping-cough from Nellie Ames ; they were together only a few minutes , " meaning that the gods should have been reasonably generous to her and her child . A business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goods and argues : " I ought not to be blamed for that . I had paid insurance a hundred times . Surely I had a rightto expect a little luck . " A boy thinks that he will pass an examination on a subject in only half of which he is competent . The Germans blame America for disappointing their hopes , instead of blaming themselves for having foolish hopes . The employer thinks that the discontent in his factory will blow over , but it does n't , and a consideration of all the facts would have shown that it could n't . The labor leader thinks that the A B C 's will surely strike in sympathy , though the actual facts , minus luck and fairies , prove conclusively that they probably wo n't . The communist really looks to some deus ex machina to supply new motives to replace the motives of ownership and independence . He is so sure that state ownership of property is desirable that in his heart of hearts he expects some secret powers of the universe to make it succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is fully educated , fully rational , entirely sound in his thinking , hardly any one is entirely free from this resort to magic . A most successful man and , as men go , a most acute thinker , explained European history as a result of a progressive movement producing a reaction , which in turn produced a progressive movement , quite as if a progressive movement were a fairy godmother and reaction a wicked ogre of a folk-tale . Some sociologists of the benevolent sort discuss evolution or development or progress in ways that are defensible only if evolution or progress is a tutelary deity holding human welfare up , and even shoving it gently forward , when all other forces would let it slip back . During the war his subterranean faith in magic played a large part in the universal cursing of the then Kaiser . Men and women reviled him not only because they felt hate , and because it was a cheap and comfortable way of being patriotic , but also probably because they really thought their curses would hurt him and his cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be soundly beaten or heavily fined than cursed with a proper magical formula ; and this fear of the spoken word persists in the half-educated of to-day . In the present hopes of the manual workers to gain compensation for the discomforts in which the war involved them magic intrudes amusingly . Two out of four employees half regard the employer as a jinn who can command dollars at his own sweet will . If you can cajole or frighten the jinn he will get more dollars for you out of his magic pot . This fantasy has been counteracted not so much by any clear sense of the facts in the case as by the long-established habits of expecting a plumber or brass-worker , or what not , to receive about so much . The war disturbed these habits by its emergency wages , and gave magical fancies their chance . The fully educated man knows that nothing happens without a natural , matter-of-fact cause , and forms his hopes and fears and acts in harmony with this knowledge . He controls things , other men , and himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain to be forged by fairies . If he wins he knows why , and , even in losing , he learns . The half-educated man works in the dark of luck and magic . So even his successes may work for failure , teaching him nothing , or lies . A second main feature of the half-educated mind is its restriction of thought to self-justification . The really educated man directs his feelings and actions by reason . The half-educated man lets his passions and desires direct his thinking . He thinks chiefly to justify himself in something he wishes or has done . Since he likes to play golf , he thinks how good it is for his health . Since he likes to drive an automobile , he thinks how pleasant it is to go out with all the family . Since he dislikes music , he thinks how much time and money are spent on music that might better be spent in healthy outdoor games . Since he has failed to make much money , he consid ers that money-making is a greedy , materialistic sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one 's selfish interests " rationalizing , " though " irrationalizing " would perhaps describe it better . We have some desire or aversion and set our reason at work to defend or " rationalize " it . Led by some motive , we have acted in a certain way and set our thinking to work to defend it , not only to others , but to ourselves . All this may be quite innocent , as in the case of the infant son of William James . The child had played gladly with frogs up to a certain date , and then was seized with a pronounced aversion for them . He would not touch one , and when urged said that he could not take it because it was too heavy ! So a woman urged to handle a mouse might think of it as too nasty . So saloon-keepers may quite honestly think prohibition is too great an infringement of personal rights ; so the man who is comfortably fixed in the world regards any change in it as too radical . The fully educated man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being led by the naked facts , regardless of the consequences to his own comfort or self-esteem . His observations and logic are not harnessed to his hopes and fears , but are free to follow the trail of truth wherever it leads . The half-educated man thinks only in self-defense . There arc two ways of achieving a satisfying self-respect in this world . One is to meet the world squarely , conquer its difficulties , make friends with its beneficent forces , meet its requirements so far as you can , and get , so far as the world will give it to you , genuine payment in the blessings of health , work , food , friendship , love , mastery , approval , and pride in what the world thinks of you . The man who does this loses nothing by thinking of things as they are , since it is from things as they are that he - wrests durable satisfactions of life . He sees himself as others see him , sees others as they are , and , adaptTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE HALF-EDUCATED MAN ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , gets what he can . What he does get is genuine . Such a man has at least one element of a real education ? he has learned to face the world and Will or lose on merit . The other way is to retreat within your own soul whenever it is convenient , avoiding the world 's difficulties , blaming it when its requirements are beyond you , and paying yourself by excuses , hopes , explanations , resignation , and the like if the world does not give you the genuine pleasure , power , and prominence that you crave . If you do not get a job , you tell yourself that you are too independent in spirit . If you fail in courtship , you decide that she was not your real love . If you lack friends , you are consoled by thinking that your individuality is too fine to be appreciated by the common herd . You preserve your self-respect , not by genuine success in the real world , but by retreat to an imaginary world which you construct in such fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may be satisfied , but his wife , if intelligent , can not be , and he is a nuisance to his neighbors and acquaintances . Such men arc found among graduates of colleges , but they are of the half-educated ? they have not learned to live and win in the real world . A third characteristic of the half-educated man is his inability to think a problem through . He is like a chess-player who fails to consider all the possible replies to his attack , and to consider any one of them more than a few moves ahead . As a merchant , he buys goods that attract him without thinking whether his customers want such goods or ought to want them . As a manufacturer , he hires a beginner for his factory at eight dollars if she will take eight , nine if she asks for nine , ten if she insists on ten , promotes nobody until he is forced to , and then is surprised that there is so bad a spirit in his factory . As a fanner , he works ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out whether the cows are supporting him or he is supporting the cows . As a big business director , he votes for bonuses , installs safety devices , hires social workers , and provides amusements , when the real trouble is the petty tyranny of foremen and the brutality of the thugs who are his works-policemen . One can hardly ride two hours in a trolley-car or train with working-men without hearing one of them , perhaps in the course of otherwise sagacious remarks , say , " Why should n't every working-man receive his fifty dollars a week or his hundred dollars a week ? " If you reply , " For the same reason that he ca n't get fifty eggs a week or fifty quarts of milk a week , " he will see no point . If you ask him , " How much is fifty dollars or a hundred dollars multiplied by four hundred million ? " he will think you are mildly insane . Since it is easy for him to see where one workman ? to wit , himself ? could get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without any social or financial miracle , he fails to carry thought on to ask where forty thousand million dollars a week is to come from in the world . Fully half of our citizens regard it as a mixture of glory and crime that certain men should have great wealth . When they day-dream or read the Sunday supplements they admire the glory . When they read yellow journal editorials or go to the polls they resent the crime . Yet thought pushed just one step further would show that the rich man 's crime or glory can be only in how he got wealth or what he does with it . The educated man may not have thought out any of the Loaners which I have been mentioning ; his mind may-not have tackled them at all . If it did tackle them , however , it would fight through to a finish . It would see the issue clear to the end , if it could ; and , if it could n't , it would not claim to have settled the issue . The educated man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give answers they are bitter-end answers . The half-educated man thinks till he reaches some conclusion that sounds well or otherwise strikes fancy , and then makes peace with issue . We can sum up these three qualities of the half-educated man by a homely analogy . Suppose that a man , who needed to go from New York to Chicago , instead of buying his ticket , finding the train and boarding it , and staying in it till he reached Chicago , should sit in the station hoping that somebody would offer him a private car ! Suppose that , having finally bought a ticket to Chicago and boarded the train , he finds that it is the train to Boston , arid , instead of realizing his blunder , thinks , " It 's good to go by way of Boston , so as to see my mother-in-law ! " Suppose that , misled by the look of the station , he gets off at Cleveland , in spite of the fact that lie should know that he has ten hours more to travel ! Pseudo-thinking must probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human race is bred . Some of it , however , can be cured . The cure is twofold , consisting of the displacement of pseudo-thinking by real expertness on the one hand or by intelligent refusal to think on the other . Expert thinking can not be expected of many men outside of a limited field . Within the limits of human capacity we can have as much expert thinking as we will pay for , in time and money . All our medical schools or business schools can be made to teach the best practices in medicine or business , instead of some antiquated , outworn customs , if we will pay the cost . There is the same cure for plumbers or printers or teachers or electrical engineers or salesmen or cooks who now blunder in thinking about their respective problems that there is for children who think that 4X4 is 8 , or that 154-34 is 5 , or that half of a half of a half is twice as much as a quarter of a quarter of a quarter . In his special field , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man may be made a competent thinker . The educated man should be taught to think with approxi mately 100 per cent . efficiency in his share of the world 's job . Outside that field the intelligent procedure for most of us is to refuse to think , spending our energy rather in finding the expert in the case and learning from him . That is what sagacious men already do almost universally in matters like surgery , chemistry , mathematics , or seismology . They are doing it widely in such less recognized fields of expertness as building construction , philanthropy , advertising , and education . They are beginning to do it in fields that not Iong ago were supposed to be problems anybody could properly think out , such as the selection of one 's employees , the choice of occupation for one 's children , the planning of a city 's government , the tariff , the expenditure of public money , or the regulation of public morals . Wherever there is the expert ? the man or woman who has mastered the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain field is based , and who can adapt this best present practice to special circumstances ingeniously ? should we not let him be our guide ? Should we not , in fact , let him do our thinking for us in that field ? Thought is too precious to he wasted in dilettantism ; the issues of the twentieth century are too complex and difficult to be played with by amateurs . The general common sense that was admirable for the tasks of the town meeting of our fathers is hopelessly inadequate for the municipal problems of to-day . It is likely to be an easy prey to the selfishness of politicians , the seductiveness of salesmen , and the enthusiasm of fanatics . Our thought , if we trust it too far , will in fact not , be our thinking , but only the ready-made conclusions that have been sold to us by somebody . The question is whether we shall buy from somebody who will play on our vanity and prejudices or from a reputable dealer . The educated man should know when not to think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
