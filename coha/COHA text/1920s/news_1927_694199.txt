txt The coal etriko which began on April 1 continued , with minor violence in Ohio and elsewhere and little apparent progress toward settlement . The prosperity of the nonunion mines as a consequence of the strike has led the operators in western Kentucky to grant a wage bonus of 20 per cent . Some of the operators in Indiana and elsewhere In the central competitive field have made peace with the union by accepting the Jacksonville wage scale . Those are the surface events . Underlying them are facts of fundamental economic Importance which are controlling the situation . The most important of them is that the nation no longer has to accept the terms which coal operators and miners choose to make . In the last tenor fifteen years substitutes for coal have been found and exploited , with the result that coal is no longer an absolute necessity for heat and power . This country can not at present or for a long time to come get along without coal in enormous quantities , but the rival fuels are present in sufficient quantity to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In technology have enabled us to develop more heat and power from a given unit of coal than we formerly did . Harper Leech in a recent article in THE Tnrstrrno showed the trend . Further evidence along the same line was brought forward only a few days ago , when the figures on coal consumption by class 1 railroads were made public . These figures showed that in 1926 it required 42 fewer pounds of coal to move 1,000 tons of freight one mile than were required in 1020 . The total saving in tons is estimated at 23,000,000 and in dollars at CM : 000,000 in the freight service alone . The coal industry is suffering from a broken monopoly and a diminishing demand . When these facts are recognized and acted upon by operators and miners there Is reason to hope that the industry In the central competitive Held may be revived and perhaps restored to something like its former importance ; but to achieve eveh that mark will require a long , hard pull .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
