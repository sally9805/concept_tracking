December 31 , 1924 THE NEW . A COMMUNICATION Child Labor and Liberty SIR : Will you allow me to express my keen interest in the editorial in your issue of December 3 , entitled Child Labor , the Home and Liberty , in which you do me the honor of refering to a letter of mine in the New York Times of November If ? The matter , according to you editorial , is quite simple : the proposed TTwentiethAmendr - ment does not confer any more power upon Congress than state legislatures now possess. ; the question , therefore , is a question not of principle but of practice and " the eem comics of the issue " needs only to be brought to the front in order to refute the " fat business men and windy professors " who now prate about the sacredness of the home . Thank you for making the whole thing on perfectly p/ain . Even a windy profess or can appreciate the succinct- Miss and lucidity with which you write . The only trouble with your very perspicuous exposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true . " Does any parent in the United States , " you ask , " now enjoy discretion beyond the possibility of legislative invasion in disposing of his children 's time and labor that it is assured the Child Labor Antendmmt would destroy ? " You answer " No . " But the right answer is " Yes . " The pa- rents of the United States are now protected from legislative interference by the great " hill-of-rights " provisions in the Constitution of the Cr:ited Stare the basis of which the Sum-erne Co/art invalidated , for example , the Nebraska language law which made literary education a crime . But this new amendment is to font part of the very instrument which contains that N11 of rights . Its passage therefore could be held to interpret authoritatively ( or set aside to the extent necessary to give effect to its provisions ) those previous am endments . No state legislature , for example , now has a right under the Constitution of the United Stator to prohibit all labor of all persons up to eighteen years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct provisions of the new amendment would have such a right . It has been maintained , indeed , by advocates of the amendment that the courts would never interpret it to Mean what it says . We regard such an assurance as exceedingly precarious ; and even if it were not so precarious , have grave misgivings about the notion which it involves as to the function of a court . But even if we should prove to be wrong at this point , even if it were true that the proposed amendment merely confers upon Congress powers already possessed by the state legislatures , would the question of that transfer of power be , . yoke represent it , a mere question of detail to be decided by " economic " considerations of efficiency ? We think not . Will you permit me to observe that at this point your conception of American institutions differs fundamentally from ou We hold that the local autonomy of the states , far frors.m being a mere matter of expediency , is at the very foundation of our American freedom . But under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By far the most important half of life would be placed under the control of a centralized bureaucracy But fromone point of View your insistence upon the " economics " of the is is justified . The approval of the amendment would indeed be mica/ly a very great benefit to one class in the poptdeconoation ? narody to the vast army of federal agents and inspectors which any exercise of the powers conferred by the amendment would require . The federal agents would be economically benefited ; but American libertyand the sanctity of the American home would be gone . Finally , may I cal/ attention to a slight inaccuracy in your reference to my letter in The Tim .. You make my letter refer to a vindication of the sacredness of the home which wou/d be accomplished if the amendment were finally rejected by the states . But what I actually referred to was the vindication which has already been given by the enor- mous adverse vote in Massachusetts ( 696,119 to 247,221 ) . There are hardy 696,000 " windy professors " even in a state like Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population is notoriously high . It is quite possible , on the contrary , that the American people is at law making its voice heard . If so , legislatures may well take heed . The voice of the people , when it is heard with the decisiveness of that Massachusetts vote , is rather a majestic thing .
