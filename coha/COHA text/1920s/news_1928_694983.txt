txt America is only throwing a bluff at being bad and is deeply religious , according to the Rev. John B. Kelly , spiritual director of the Catholic Writers ' Guild of America , who spoke yesterday morning at the Hotel Commodore before 1,000 guests attending the Fourth Annual Communion Breakfast of the Knights of Columbus of Queens County . Four combined councils constituting the Eleventh District were represented . " America has n't been discovered yet , " he said . " It is my belief that this country is only throwing a bluff at being bad , in spite of the extent to which crime news appears in the newspapers . If we ever see the day when virtue is so unusual that it gets into the headlines , then we may have cause for concern . " Go around among men of every class , among the gangs of the east side for example , and you will find they believe in God . They , too , are only throwing a bluff at being bad . Religion is a man 's game and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too virile to be pious . " Bernard M. Patten Speaks . In his second public address since his election , Bernard M. Patten , President of the Borough of Queens , declared that his remarks had no political significance and that he asked for no support on religious grounds . " I am an American by adoption . " he said . " I take my governmental religion from the flag and from the Constitution and from no other source . I take my religion from the See of Rome . I want every one to know that I am a Roman Catholic and I am proud of my allegiance to the Church . " Other speakers were Magistrate Peter M. Daly , J. Connor French of Trenton , N. J. , District Court Judge of Mercer County ; Octave J. Ro'nary , District Deputy of the Knights of Columbus , and the Rev. John Lonergan , chaplain of Calvary Cemetery , Queens . Factors in the material development of the United States were surveyed by Magistrate Daly , who said he considered the moral and educational progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ignorance . " Religious prejudice is not so much due to malice as to ignorance , " he declared . " It results from a lack of understanding of one another . One of the principles of our organization is that we must love our neighbor and try to understand him . Whatever our ancestry may have been , we can and should- adhere to the same principles and ideals . " The principles and ideals of the Knights of Columbus were discussed by Judge French , the guest of honor , who confined his remarks largely to the aims of the organization and to what it might accomplish in the future .
