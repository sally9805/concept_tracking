In Delaware Bay , an oyster sucked a little fish into his maw . The fish fed himself fat upon the other fish the oyster ate . One day , grown bigger , he ate the oyster . Last week in Dover , Del. , the oyster shell was opened by one Mrs. I. Paul Jones . Out fell the fish . <P> <P> Rabbit <P> In Mulhouse , Alsace-Lorraine , one De Mouche , farmer , put on his hunting cap , took his long gun in hand , and went out to visit his rabbit snares . Sure enough , in the first snare cowered a furry creature , pressing its soft white belly against the ground , upturning stricken , opalescent eyes . Farmer De Mouche chuckled . He laid his long shotgun upon the ground and bent to secure his game . But suddenly there was a scuffle behind him ; another rabbit leaped out of the bush , sprang upon the shotgun 's trigger . " BANG ! " Farmer De Mouche received both barrels in his back . Bloody , mangled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the snare . <P> Rat <P> In Brooklyn , one Rachael Galpern , 14 , was taking a hot soap-bath before going to a party . Hearing a slight scratching in the ceiling above her , she raised her eyes in time to see a pointed grey face peer at her from a hole in the plaster . The hole widened , the thin mortar crumbled , and an enormous black rat fell into the water with her , splashed about , caressed her with its clammy paws and insolently ogled her . Rachael screamed ; Mrs. Galpern rushed in and killed the rat with a poker . That evening at the party when a little boy exclaimed " Oh , rats ! " Rachael Galpern became hysterical . First a doctor , then a nerve specialist was called . Her father collected $1,700 from his landlord for " injury to nervous system . " <P> Horse <P> In Brooklyn , a fish peddler ( Giacomo Puleo ) and a laundry-wagon driver ( William Levine ) left their horses uncovered in a storm . Haled to court they were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter rain . Magistrate Golden said : " Now you know what it feels like . " <P> <P> Turken <P> In Des Moines , a small but red-eyed turkey gobbler was mated with a large chicken . Eggs were laid , hatched , and a barnyard hybrid stepped forth which the breeder , one Roy Beck , called a turken . " Its meat combines the delicacy of chicken with the flavor of turkey . " " Turkens will bring 70c to 80c a pound next November , " said Breeder Beck . <P> <P> Goldfish <P> How old is an old goldfish ? Thirty years or more . Yet , because of bad care , the average lifetime of a goldfish is only six weeks . Last week the American Railway Express Co. , which handles thousands of goldfish every year , told people how to look after them : <P> 1 ) Handle carefully . <P> 2 ) Change the water every twelve hours , but remember that too sudden a change of temperature may kill the fish . Therefore pour off only haK of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Fill the cans not more than three-quarters full , as too much water does not leave enough room for air . <P> 3 ) Do n't smother the fish . They breathe and must have plenty of oxygen . . . . When the fish come to the surface and gasp , this indicates that the oxygen in the water has been exhausted and the water should be changed . <P> 4 ) Keep the cans out of the sun in summer and away from steam pipe-and stoves in winter . Do n't allow the water to freeze .
