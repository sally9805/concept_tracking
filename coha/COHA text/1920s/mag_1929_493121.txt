session has flatly failed and that his leadership has been feeble and ineffective . Also his lack of frankness about the rates , which clashed with his known views , lends color to the allegation that he preferred to play with and rely on the Old Guard , and would take the dose they had pre ? pared , if it could be sufficiently diluted to swallow without a too-mortifying exhibition . My personal opinion is that this does Mr. Hoover an injustice , and that he would have vetoed a bill which seemed to him bad . I believe that he hoped to apply his pressure and do his talking most effec ? tively after the bill got into conference , and thought it would be bad policy for him to speak on rates until after the bill got through the Senate , and the rates were there fixed , and he really knew what they were . There is , to be sure , an argument for this attitude , but I think it was poor judgment However , it must be admitted that Herbert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politically harmful effects of the flop he has made in the extra session . I have before pointed out what I be ? lieve to be true , that if the London naval conference is spectacularly successful , the popularity of Mr. Hoover with the masses of the people will be enormously strengthened and the criticisms of the sort above made of him will seem trivial and unimportant . So far as people generally are con ? cerned , the interest in the tariff is spotty and thin . The popular disposition is always to side with the President as against the Senate . Any President moving aggressively toward peace , strikes a responsive note all over the country . Hoover is moving in that direction and with intense ear ? nestness . Whatever the realities in the path of his food-security proposal , the direction is unmistakable and the idea , couched in simple language , appeals to the voters because they can measurably understand it . On the tariff , the pub ? lic , mind is badly blurred , and will be further confused by the buck-passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food-ship proposal is something people can grasp , and the reaction , particularly from the Democratic press , proves it . For one thing , it contrasts with that amazingly trucu ? lent speech just a year ago of the timid Calvin , no ade ? quate explanation of which as to either authorship or in ? spiration has ever been given . For another , it contrasted with the Senate situation , with its " sons of the wild jack ? ass " silliness , its unsavory Bingham-Eyanson incident and its general small-bore bitterness and bickerings . It was a new note and from a higher plane . It put the President in a favorable light and showed him functioning in the role he is best equipped to play . Further , it did considerable to blot out the Hiram Johnson incident and letter , which upset the Secretariat , disturbed the medicine-ball cabinet , and was from start to finish bad business . Altogether , the speech was sound presidential politics , particularly sound because it was sincere . The net effect of the speech would justify the Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra session ends , with the tariff bill on the ropes , a hos ? tile coalition in control , and the regular Republican leader ? ship in a pathetic state of disintegration and demoraliza ? tion ? if it were not for one thing . That , of course , is the terrifically depressed condition of the stock market and theinevitable sagging of trade bound to follow . That is seri ? ous ? serious not only from the economic but also from the political standpoint . A change in the psychology of the coun ? try from optimism to pessimism is the greatest danger any administration can have . If the slump really proves to be bad , the prosperity argument that so effectually retained the Republican party in power in spite of its criminal record will be impossible . And that affords the Democrats their real chance of gaining control of the House next year . It Is a chance that takes all the joy out of life for the Hoover group . It is his worst piece of luck . U NTIL " The Silver Tassie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen a challenging thing this season . There have been good things and bad things , fortunate and delightful moments , or moments that failed to go off or were boring ; but there has been nothing that presented a theory or point of view ; nothing that , good or bad as it might be , you knew to be what it was because of some in ? tention or cause , some challenging method or school or style or technical theory or theory of life . Mr. Scan O'Casey 's play does challenge you . A great many ques ? tions arise in your mind , problems of realism , of removal in style , of production , of diction , of unity of tone , of inclu ? siveness . This play tells the story of a young man , Harry Heegan , who had in his time won the silver cup three times in foot ? ball contests . Susie loves him , he loves Jessie . He and other soldiers are at home on leave from the front . He starts out , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last moment with his mother , and the curtain falls . In the second act , the scene is somewhere in France , a ruined abbey sort of place , with a slanting crucifix on one side and on the other a soldier with his arms tied up in a cross , taking his punishment for stealing a goose . The Kyrie Elcison is sung in a chapel to the right . The soldiers talk , or sing , for all through this act the movement is ritual ? istic and the lines are sung to music that is sardonically reminiscent of the church service . A worker for the sol ? diers ' welfare comes ; the act ends with the guns firing . In the third act , the young man is in a wheel chair , his legs paralyzed . An operation , the second , is to be made to ? morrow . Susie is now a nurse . The hospital doctor is singing songs around her . The hero 's father and old friends are in the same hospital . His mother comes and others from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lingers on the lawns below , walking with another man , and sends him flowers and his ukulele . He asks God to give him a square deal . In the last act , there is a dance at the football club . Jessie is with the other man , Harry 's old friend ; everyone is merry with wine , balloons and danc ing . Susie is with the doctor ; there is a blind soldier , there are old men , the mother , the neighbors ; and life is trivial , running in trite grooves , oblivious of the crippled man , to whom these people mean to be kind . He is wheeled out at last by the blind soldier , and the dancing begins again . " It 's a terrible pity , " the wife of the blind man says , " Harry was too weak to stay an ' sing his song , for there 's nothing I love more than the ukulele 's tinkle-tinkle in the night-time . " The story gives very little of the play 's quality , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now poetic , stylized , arbitrary , elaborate , highly written , sardonic , expression ? istic as the case may be , moment by moment and line by line . Many of the passages in this play come from the darkened and sharp and tragic soul of a poet . The things written here about the secret torture of the man after he has been made a cripple are bitter and often beautiful . The drawing is nearly always marked and full of sudden and bold transitions ; the outline of the motives and ex ? planations ? the explanation of how so many people from home got there at the hospital , for example ? is left simple and high-handed ; but that is all a part of the author 's in ? tention of keeping the play as far from reality , or realism , as he chooses and when he chooses . We are realistic , al ? most photographic , and then , without preparation , we are very much stylized , or poetic or arranged . Sometimes , the effect is merely adolescent.The impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unequal , willful , bold and not always interesting . The play , moreover , suffers here in America from the lack of a surrounding social con ? dition or artistic current that might give it more searching applications and feed it fires ; a good deal of it only shoots into the air . In this work is the mind of a poet that to me at least is more striking and tormented than memorable or moving or important . What I like best in " The Silver Tassie " is the strong , searched-out drawing , in the sense that might be applied to certain modern painting . The production of a play so full of differing planes as this play is , would be a problem for anybody . How to be natural one minute and to talk a removed and poetic or ex ? pressionistic dialogue the next , how to do scenes that are written in patterns , how to handle in the midst of a wholly modern scene a passage that dilates the range of things said and felt to Elizabethan variety and Elizabethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and something that no modern theater that I have seen has ever got quite es ? tablished as yet . The present-day dramatists ' writing in such instances is not yet wholly established , not set , in key and method . The acting at the Irish Theater was only passable , sometimes not that , but Mr. Miceal Breathnach in his directing did a good piece of work . In the second act , where the play is most expressionistic and stylized , he succeeded best . To teach actors to imitate nature is not al ? ways so difficult ; to coach them effectively for an elabo ? rate visual design is a hard business . ADVICE TO MR . CHENKIN In his New York beginnings last year , Mr. Victor Chen-kin made a fine start , as is clear from his announcement of eight appearances on successive Sunday evenings at the Times Square Theater . In his best numbers , Mr. Chenkin // puts most of the theatrical entertainments on Broadway to shame , both as to what he does himself and the amount of enthusiasm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on the billboards as " the singing actor , " which is right , for he is a remarkable actor , but which does not indicate sufficiently the excellence of his voice and his musical gifts . He phrases well , and does little violence to the musical form in each of the pieces that he is using for his characterizations and dramatic effects . His voice is as much of an actor as the rest of him . It can take , with an ease that plainly comes from the dramatic feeling behind it and from very good training , many diverse qualities ; it can be restrained and clear , for the Old French , white for the Italian , covered and haunting for the Gypsy , rich and moving for the Jewish ; and for the Cossack and Ukrainian , best of all , his tone becomes wild and metallic , that dark , sharp , indescribable quality in the Tartar voice that we all know , and that colors , with immense power , some of the most cultivated Russian voices . Mr. Chenkin sings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballads , of which Rataplan is one of the most effective warhorses ; a number from the age of sentiment , the world of Alfred de Musset and his sighing friends ; a Gypsy number ; a Chassidic number , in two costumes , two personages ; a Neapolitan number ; a Ukrainian number ; sometimes , the Cossack number . Of these the Ukrainian , partly because of the remarkable make ? up and characterization , is perhaps the best , certainly the most striking ; but the Yiddish is as good and is more pro ? found , with its Jewish ritual , solemn , tragic passion and crude comedy ; and the Cossack is as wild and exciting as songs can be . The advice to Mr. Chenkin arrives with the other three numbers on the program . Of these , the songs from the age of sentiment are not bad , provided they were more varied and not all so close to recitations ; he needs to put in some song that would show more of the melodic . The Neapolitan songs should be entirely overhauled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terpretation is true , the gamin of the Naples streets as once seen by operatic travelers , gay , carefree , shining and quick . But false too . Moreover a warmer and more lovely song is needed , for Naples is not all so bright , staccato , slight-voiced and merry . There should be a hint , too , of gravity , the gravity of an animal , now and then . And the cos ? tume needs to be changed entirely from that snowy-legged , gaily striped , picturesquely rent and patched effect , and that moth-eaten wig ? tousled , if you like , but not so dry and dim . About the French number in the black-and-white jester 's costume , dear no doubt to the singer 's heart , one must be hard . It is good singing , good phrasing ; there are indications of good control and so on . But the whole ef ? fect is not on a level with the best parts of Mr. Chenkin 's program , and is somehow unconvincing and too marked dramatically , too obvious ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing to discriminating admirers . One more point . At a bull-fight , one of the first things we see is the bull charging a horse ; we see the gore , we realize the power of the bull , and after that we feel the right tension and excitement and sense of danger in the ring . Following this'lead , Mr. Chenkin ought to indicate somewhere very early in his program the amount of voice he really has , how he can sing when it comes to straight volume and tone . This would not only impress the thea ? ter crowd but would increase our pleasure in the variety of voices , and the subordination of the voice itself , that he exhibits most of the time . And where is that song of the rabbi to his pupils that he sings so unforgettably , with so much fanaticism , grandeur and power ? He should not be afraid to keep that song on every program , to show what he himself can be . S IR : Mr. Borsodi 's " way out " has been referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the domestic system , the family group produces articles for sale . The classic example is the manufacture of cloth in England before the industrial revo ? lution . It is adapted to high prices and small capital and , in competition with the factory system , it degenerates into the sweat ? shop . But this can not be the system to which Mr. Borsodi refers , since he objects to selling any of his produce . His system is more like that used by the Romans and many other ancient peoples and called , I believe , " family economy . " The unit of production , the family group , is the same as in the domestic system , but the pur ? pose is entirely different , since the goods are intended to be used by the group that produced them . Because the producer can cheat nobody but himself , he is encouraged to make a limited quantity of as good a quality as he knows bow .... The American farm furnishes an example of a change from what was once dominantly family economy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat-shop . There has been a corresponding change in the quality of the product and in the viewpoint . I recently heard a dairyman express both view ? points when he said that Holstein milk was plenty good enough to sell to the city consumer , but that every self-respecting farmer should keep good Guernseys for his own table . There is another system involved in the discussion of Mr. Bor ? sodi 's article which , so far as I know , has never received a name . Its most extreme example is to be found in hotel life . It is a system of consumption corresponding to the factory system of production . In the factory-hotel system the worker is paid wages to produce goods over which he has no control . As a consumer , he buys everything he needs in the open market at a considerable advance in price . This , rather than the domestic system , Is the one that should be compared to family economy . Family economy stresses goods ; the factory-hotel system distracts attention from goods and stresses money . It tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money or credit ) and then hands the basket over to the control of bankers , employers , speculators , high-pressure salesmen and cap ? tains of industry . It is the delight of great executives , who do all the deciding , and of morons , who wish to decide nothing . It appears to be a secure life , with a fixed income and regular hours of work . The fact that the income may at best be too small to live on with comfort , and that everything goes when the job goes , is apt to be overlooked by the rural population , who have no experi ? ence with it . Also , the work is very monotonous . As between the domestic and the factory systems of production , I will bet on the factory system , and so , I suppose , would Mr. Borsodi . But as between the hotel and family economy systems of consumption I am not so sure . One of the difficulties experienced by Mr. Borsodi 's critics is due to the tendency to calculate all profits in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time element entirely . The importance of time may be seen in the case of shelter . There is a widely accepted belief that it is cheaper to rent than to own a house . I am living in an eight-room house situated on three acres of land . This year the interest on invest ? ment , taxes and insurance on house , out-buildings and car , and the cost of painting the house , will not exceed $500 . This is less than six dollars per room per month . In addition I have much greater security of tenure than a renter . I can remain in my house for four years after I have ceased to pay taxes . After two years , the authorities can sell the tax lien on the property , but the pur ? chaser can not take possession for another two years , and then only If I am still unable to repay him with interest at not more than 9 percent . This combination of the factory system and family economy , to the extent of owning a home with enough ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled craftsmen as safer than either alone . It enables them to divide their eggs between two baskets , and if one upsets they may be able to save the other . But anyone who moves into the country expecting to make money sell ? ing produce in addition to his work in the factory , is sure to be disappointed . Selling produce requires either specialization or a tremendous amount of time hunting up markets . It never pays to try to sell small quantities of anything .... Princeton , N. J.

In view of the fact that Mr. Grattan wrote the last nine chapters from material collected by Mr. Ilibben , he will , I trust , accept as a compliment my statement that , " One feels the author 's own vivid personality in every line .

Not the Foreign Office SIR : Typographical mistakes are rarely worth correction ; but in my article on the naval question I am unfortunately made to say that the Foreign Office ? by which is generally understood the British Foreign Office ? has an ingrained liking for alliances ; this apparent attack on Mr. MacDonald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has puzzled and pained some of my friends . There Is , of course , as the whole context shows , no attempt on the part of Great Britain to inveigle the United States into an alliance . What I wrote was " foreign offices , " and in the " s " is a world of difference . Certain Continental countries have indeed the " alliance complex " ; they seek allies for them selves , and they sec in any friendly exchanges between Great Britain and the United States the beginning of an alliance . Which is precisely what I denied ; and what all sensible observers deny . New York City . SISLEY HUDDLESTON .
