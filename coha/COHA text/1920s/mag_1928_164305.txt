Furious was the rate of trading all last week on the New York Stock Exchange . Many a trader had been bearish , gambling on the probabilities that prices would fall . Of this , shrewd men laden with money were fully aware . They bought stocks and in such quantities that the bears could not supply . Shares of the Radio Corporation of America were particularly and peculiarly in demand . One Michael J. Meehan , Manhattan broker , bought and sold them for Arthur W. Cutten of Chicago and the Fisher brothers of Detroit , who managed a sort of corner in R.C.A. stock . Its price , consequently , rose $30 in the week . Prices of other stocks rose correspondingly . When the week ended , members of the New York Stock Exchange realized that on each of five successive days they had traded more than 3,000,000 shares , a record ; that during the week they had traded 20,500,000-odd shares , another record . Whereupon , Trader Meehan broke another record-by paying $315,000 for a partner 's seat on the exchange .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
