Employers were reported divided on a proposal to offer the men 00 cents a day more and arbitrate the difference . Secretary Tompkins said that the wage drive had been approved by the Executive Committee of the old Building Trades Council , and that last Tuesday it was ratified by a convention of delegates of all the crafts . All affiliated locals then were authorized to begin negotiations with their respective ern ' ployer-groups at once . Adds $25,000,000 to Costs . The carpenters . 36.000 strong , already are in negotiation with the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters also have presented the demand . The next few days will account for the remainder , it was said . Word of the proposed wage move has been known in builders ' circles for some ' time . It has been viewed with anxiety because of the estimated $25,000,0001 burden the increase would add to the ' present annual building cost , employers said , with no slackening of building activity in sight .

It was noted with some encouragement that the present demand of the old council did not carry with it anything savoring of an ultimatum . Absence of strike talk was regarded as favorable toward eventual compromise , or to whatever measure final settlement might take . Some disquiet was shown , however , over the attitude of a certain group within the Building Trades Employers ' Association which is vigorously opposing the 50-50 harmony plan that will come up next Wednesday . These interests hold that the employers have been bilked to the limit of endurance , and some of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , described as in the majority in employers ' councils , hope . it is said , to find a meeting ground for a settlement In the next few days .
