Homer nodded ; Shakespeare gave Bohemia a seacoast ; Michelangelo painted Adam with a navel . Last week the august New York Times slipped and fell . Readers of the Times read a pathetic story about a deer , frightened , running for its life through the streets of Brooklyn . Circumstantial was the Times reporter . Said he : " The wanderer was not a large deer , as deer go . It had a manner that plainly showed it expected very little from life " , According to the Times , the deer was small , had no antlers . The story spoke of children and Santa Claus . The deer 's fate was tragic ; a policeman encountered it , shot seven times , killed it . <P> So effective was the Times story that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was moved to investigate . The deer turned out to be a steer . <P> Some of the Times 's friends realized with sympathy that its queer deer story was only a shade more embarrassing than a story which the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bovine championship of the Argentine had been , won by an animal named Esther Bletchley Challenge , the Times sonorously reported : <P> " The most important person in Argentina this week is Esther , grand champion of champions in Argentina 's annual beauty show . . . . Even President Irigoyen is momentarily overlooked except for the day he presided over the ceremonies at which Esther was declared champion , and even then the president of the Republic played second fiddle to Esther . With insuperable eyes , perfect body and delicate lines , Esther has been admired this week by a great array of high government officials , diplomats and society matrons . <P> " For Esther is the grand champion shorthorn cow in Argentina 's forty-first national live stock exhibition and is more truly a national figure than any Miss America has ever been , with her name on every tongue . in Argentine , including the furthest frontiers and hamlets . " <P> Argentinians were convulsed . Buenos Aires humorists chortled . To their beef-wise minds , nothing could have been more comical than making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion bull for which Bovril Co. paid 30,000 pesos to publicize its beef extract .
