( Page 91 ) 89 **72;6200;TOOLONG THE TALE OF HENRIETTA HEN I A SPECKLED BEAUTY Henrietta Hen thought highly of herself . Not only did she consider herself a " speckled beauty " ( to use her own words ) but she had an excellent opinion of her own ways , her own ideas -- even of her own belongings . When she pulled a fat worm -- or a grub -- out of the ground she did it with an air of pride ; and she was almost sure to say , " There ! I 'd like to see anybody else find a bigger one than that ! " Of course , it would n't really have pleased her at all to have one of her neighbors do better than she did . That was only her way of boasting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention speckles Henrietta Hen was certain to speak of her own , claiming that they were the handsomest and most speckly to be found in Pleasant Valley . And if a person chanced to say anything about combs , Henrietta never failed to announce that hers was the reddest and most beautiful in the whole world . Nobody could ever find out how she knew that . She had never been off the farm . But it was useless to remind her that she had never travelled . Such a remark only made her angry . Having such a good opinion of herself , Henrietta Hen always had a great deal to talk about . She kept up a constant cluck from dawn till dusk . It made no difference to her whether she happened to be alone , or with friends . She talked just the same -- though naturally she preferred to have others hear what she said , because she considered her remarks most important . There were times when Henrietta Hen took pains that all her neighbors should hear her . She was never so proud as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary cluck was not loud enough to express her feelings . To announce such important news Henrietta Hen never failed to raise her voice in a high-pitched " Cut-cut-cut , ca-dah-cut ! " This interesting speech she always repeated several times . For she wanted everybody to know that Henrietta Hen had laid another of her famous eggs . After such an event she always went about asking people if they had heard the news -- just as if they could have helped hearing her silly racket ! Now , it sometimes happened , when she was on such an errand , that Henrietta Hen met with snubs . Now and then her question --  " Have you heard the news ? "  - -  brought some such sallies as these : " Polly Plymouth Rock has just laid an enormous egg ! Have you seen it ? " Or maybe , " Do n't be disappointed , Henrietta ! Somebody has to lay the littlest ones ! " Such jibes were certain to make Henrietta Hen lose her temper . And she would talk very fast ( and , alas ! very loud , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live among folk that were so stingy of their praise that they could n't say a good word for the finest eggs that ever were seen ! On such occasions Henrietta Hen generally talked in a lofty way about moving to the village to live . " They think enough of my eggs down there , " she would boast . " Boiled , fried , poached , scrambled , or for an omelette -- my eggs ca n't be beaten . " " If the villagers ca n't beat your eggs they certainly ca n't use them for omelettes , " Polly Plymouth Rock told Henrietta one day . " Everybody knows you have to beat eggs to make an omelette . " Henrietta Hen did n't know what to say to that . It was almost the only time she was ever known to be silent . II A FINE FAMILY Henrietta Hen 's neighbors paid little attention to her boasting , because they had to listen to it so often . At last , however , there came a day when she set up such a cackling as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of her lungs , " Come-come-come ! See-what-I've-got ! Come-come-come ! See-what-I've-got ! " And she acted even more important than ever , until her friends began to say to one another , " What can Henrietta be so proud about ? If it 's only another egg , she 's making a terrible fuss about it . " They decided at last that if they were to have any peace they 'd better go and look at whatever it was that Henrietta Hen was squawking about . So they went -- in a body -- to the place where she had her nest , in the haymow . When Henrietta caught sight of her visitors she set up a greater clamor than ever . " Well , well ! " cried the oldest of the party , a rather sharp-tongued dame with white feathers . " What 's all this hubbub about ? " And then they learned what it was that Henrietta wanted them to see . " Did you ever set eyes on such a fine family ? " she demanded as she stepped aside from her nest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks -- eh ? " said the lady in white . " Well , what 's all the noise about ? " Henrietta Hen turned her back on her questioner . " I knew you 'd all want to have a look at these prize youngsters , " she said to the rest of the company . " You 'll agree with me , of course , that there were never any other chicks as handsome as these . " Henrietta 's neighbors all crowded up to gaze upon the soft balls of down . " This is the first family you 've hatched , is n't it ? " Polly Plymouth Rock inquired . Henrietta Hen said that it was her first brood . Her neighbors wanted to be pleasant . So they told her that her children were as fine youngsters as anybody could ask for . And the old white dame , squinting at the nestlings , said to Henrietta : " They 're the finest you 've ever had .... But there 's one of them that has a queer look . " All the other visitors tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henrietta Hen 's feelings . It was her first brood of chicks ; and they could forgive her for thinking them the best in the whole world . So when they saw that old Whitey intended to be disagreeable they began to cluck their approval of the youngsters , hoping that Henrietta would n't notice what Whitey said . Nor did she . Henrietta Hen was altogether too pleased with herself and her new family to pay much attention to anybody else 's remarks . " I hope , " said Henrietta , " that you 'll all come to see my family often . As the youngsters grow , I 'm sure they 'll get handsomer every day . " The neighbors thanked her . And crowding about old Whitey they moved away . Old Whitey just had to go too . She could n't help spluttering a little . " What a vain , empty-headed creature Henrietta Hen is ! " she exclaimed . " She does n't know that one of her brood is nothing but a duckling ! " III WET FEET Somehow Henrietta Hen never noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were her first youngsters and they all looked beautiful to her . Just as soon as Henrietta began to take her children for strolls about the farmyard she taught them a number of things . She showed them how to scratch in the dirt for food , how to drink by raising their heads and letting the water trickle down their throats . She bade them beware of hawks -- and of Miss Kitty Cat , too . And she was always warning them to keep their feet dry . " Water 's good for nothing except to drink , " Henrietta informed her chicks . " Some strange people , like old dog Spot , jump right into it . And how they manage to keep well is more than I can understand . Dust baths are the only safe ones . " So much did she fear water that Henrietta Hen would n't even let her children walk in the grass until the sun had dried the morning 's dew . And the first sprinkle of rain was enough to send her scurrying for cover , calling frantically for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her family that always lagged behind when the rain-drops began to fall . And often Henrietta had fairly to drive him away from a puddle of water . She sometimes remarked with a sigh that he gave her more trouble than all the rest of her children together . This was the youngster that Mrs. Hen 's neighbors told one another was different from his brothers and sisters . But poor Henrietta Hen only knew that he was unusually hard to manage . As her family grew bigger , Henrietta Hen took them on longer strolls , always casting a careful eye aloft now and then , lest some hawk should swoop down upon her darlings . And though no hawk tried to surprise her , something happened one day that gave Henrietta almost as great a fright as any cruel hawk could have caused her . They had strayed down by the duck-pond -- had Henrietta and her children , stopping here and there to scratch for some tidbit , or to flutter in an inviting dust-heap . Once they had reached the bank of the pond Henrietta began to wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one of the youngsters -- the one that never would hurry in out of the rain -- insisted on toddling down to the water 's edge . " Come away this instant ! " Henrietta shrieked , as soon as she noticed where he was . " You 'll get your feet wet the first thing you know . " She never said anything truer than that . The words were scarcely out of her bill when the odd member of her family flung himself into the water . Or to be more exact , he flung himself upon it ; for he floated on the surface as easily as a chip and began to paddle about as if he had swum all his life . " Come back ! Come back ! " Henrietta Hen shrieked . " You 'll be drowned -- and you 'll get your feet wet ! " IV A SWIMMER Henrietta Hen ran as fast as she could down the bank and stood as near the water as she dared , cackling loudly and flapping her wings . Her child , who was swimming in the duck-pond , seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have any intention of drowning ; and as for getting his feet wet , he acted as if he liked that . " What shall I do ? Oh , what shall I do ? " Henrietta Hen squawked . She made so much noise that some of her neighbors came a-running , to see what was the matter . And as soon as they discovered what had happened they began to laugh . " We may as well tell you , " they said to Henrietta Hen , " that that chap out there is a duckling . The water wo n't hurt him . " Henrietta Hen gasped and gaped . She was astonished . But she soon pulled herself together . And it was just like her to begin to boast . " See ! " she cried to her friends , and waved a wing toward the water with an air of pride . " There is n't one of you that has a child that can beat him swimming . " " I should hope not ! " said Polly Plymouth Rock with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that they wanted no swimmers in their families . Henrietta Hen announced that she was sorry for them . " Every brood , " she declared , " should have at least one swimmer in it . " She began to strut up and down the edge of the duck-pond , clucking in a most overbearing fashion . Really , she had never felt quite so important before -- not even when her first brood pecked their way out of their shells . " There 's nothing quite like swimming , " Henrietta Hen remarked with a silly smirk . " If it were n't for getting my feet wet I 'd be tempted to learn myself . No doubt my son could teach me . " " Your son ! " the old white hen sniffed . " He 's not your son , Henrietta Hen . Somebody played a joke on you . Somebody put a duck 's egg under you while you were hatching your eggs . And I think I can guess who it was that did it . " For just a moment Henrietta Hen stood still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comb trembled on the top of her head . She even stopped clucking . And she looked from one to another of her companions as if in hopes of finding one face , at least , that looked doubtful .... Alas ! Everybody appeared to agree with old Whitey . " If this is so , " Henrietta muttered at last , " it 's strange nobody ever noticed before that there was a duckling in my brood . " " We knew from the very first ! " Polly Plymouth Rock told her . " You were the only one on the farm that did n't see that one of your family was different from the rest . " All this time the young duckling was swimming further and further away . He seemed to have forgotten all about his foster mother . Henrietta Hen took one long last look at him . She guessed that she might have stood there forever cackling for him to come back and he would n't have paid the slightest heed to her . Then she gathered her children -- her really own -- about her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go back home now . " " What about him ? " they demanded , pointing to the truant duckling who was bobbing about on the rippling water . " Are n't you going to make him come , too ? " " No ! " said their mother . " We 're well rid of him . He has been more trouble to me than all the rest of you .... To tell the truth , I never liked him very well . " V CAUGHT BY MR . CROW It was n't far to the edge of the cornfield from the farmyard fence . And Henrietta Hen was quick to discover that the freshly ploughed and harrowed field offered a fine place to scratch for all kinds of worms and bugs and grubs . Not being what you might call a wise bird -- like old Mr. Crow -- Henrietta did n't know that Farmer Green had carefully planted corn in that field , in long rows . She did exclaim , however , that she was in great luck when now and then she unearthed a few kernels of corn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate it when she happened to find any . It is no wonder , then , that she was amazed when a hoarse voice suddenly cried right in her ear , almost , " You 're a thief and you ca n't deny it ! " She jumped . How could she have helped it ? And the voice exclaimed , " There ! You 're guilty or you 'd never have jumped like that . " Turning , Henrietta saw that a black , beady-eyed gentleman was staring at her sternly . " It takes Mr. Crow to catch ' em , " he croaked . " He can tell a corn-thief half a mile away . " All this time Henrietta Hen had n't said a word . At first she was too surprised . And afterward she was too angry . " Why do n't you speak ? " he demanded . He dearly loved a quarrel . And somehow it was n't much fun quarrelling with anybody when the other party would n't say a word . Still Henrietta Hen did n't open her mouth . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it always made him angry if anybody but himself scratched up any corn ) . " What 's the matter with you ? " he asked . " What 's the reason you do n't speak ? " " I 'm too proud to talk with you , " said Henrietta Hen . " I do n't care to be seen speaking to you , sir . " " Ha ! " Mr. Crow exploded . " Do n't you think I 'm as good as you are ? " " No ! " said Henrietta Hen . " No , I do n't ! " Mr. Crow was all for arguing with her . He began to tell Henrietta many things about himself , how he had spent dozens of summers in Pleasant Valley , what a great traveller he was , how far he could fly in a day . There was no end to his boasting . Yet Henrietta Hen never looked the least bit interested . Indeed , she began scratching for worms while he was talking . And that made the old fellow angrier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn ! " he thundered . " If you do , I 'll have to tell Farmer Green . " " He feeds me corn every day -- cracked corn ! " said Henrietta . " Well , I never ! " cried Mr. Crow . " What 's he thinking of , wasting good corn like that ? " " Really , I must n't be seen talking with you , " Henrietta Hen told Mr. Crow . " If you want to know the answer to your question , come over to the barnyard and ask the Rooster . He 'll give you an answer that you wo n't like . " And then she walked away with stately steps . Mr. Crow watched her with a baleful gleam in his eyes . He knew well enough what Henrietta meant . The Rooster would rather fight him than not . And though Mr. Crow loved a quarrel , he never cared to indulge in anything more dangerous than harsh words . " I do n't know what the farm 's coming to , " he croaked . " Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , too ! " So saying , the old gentleman turned his back on Henrietta Hen , who was already fluttering through the farmyard fence . And thereupon he scratched up enough corn for a hearty meal , grumbling meanwhile because it was n't cracked for him . " Somehow , " he muttered , " I ca n't help wishing I was a speckled hen . " VI HENRIETTA COMPLAINS There was another member of Farmer Green 's flock , besides Henrietta Hen , that was proud . Nobody needed to look twice at the Rooster to tell that he had an excellent opinion of himself . He had a way of walking about the farmyard that said quite plainly that he believed himself to be a person of great importance . And it was true that things went according to his ideas , among the flock . He was always spoken of as " the Rooster . " For although there were other roosters in the flock , they were both younger and smaller than he , and he would never permit anybody to call them -- in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep out of the Rooster 's way . If they were careless , and he caught them napping , he was more than likely to make matters unpleasant for them . He knew how to make their feathers fly . Now , Henrietta Hen thought that the Rooster behaved in a most silly fashion . She said it pained her to see him prancing about , with his two long , arched tail-feathers nodding as he walked . The truth was , Henrietta could not endure it to have any one more elegantly dressed than she . And there was no denying that the Rooster 's finery outshone everybody else 's . Why , he wore a comb on his head that was even bigger than Henrietta 's ! And he had spurs , too , for his legs . But what Henrietta Hen disliked most about the Rooster was the way he crowed each morning . It was n't so much the kind of crowing that he indulged in ; it was rather the early hour he chose for it that annoyed Henrietta . He always began his Cockle-doodle-doo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henhouse had to wake up , whether he wanted to or not . And Henrietta Hen did wish the Rooster would keep still at least till daylight came . She often remarked that it was perfectly ridiculous for any one from a fine family -- as she was -- to get up at such an unearthly hour . She said it was a wonder she kept her good looks , just on account of the Rooster 's crowing . " Why do n't you ask him to wait until it 's light , before he begins to crow ? " Polly Plymouth Rock asked Henrietta one day . " I 'll do it ! " cried Henrietta . Right then she called to one of the cockerels , who was near-by . " Just skip across the yard and ask the Rooster --  " she began . The cockerel broke right in upon her message . " Oh ! I ca n't do that ! " he exclaimed . " I 've never gone up to the Rooster and spoken to him . If I did , he 'd be sure to fight me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Henrietta . And she made the cockerel listen to her message . But he would n't be persuaded . He told Henrietta that the Rooster would be sure to jump at him the moment he opened his mouth . " Besides , " he added , " it would n't do any good , anyhow . The Rooster ca n't wait until after daylight , before he begins to crow . " " He ca n't , eh ? " Henrietta Hen spoke up somewhat sharply . " I 'd like to know the reason why ! " And fixing her gaze sternly upon the Rooster , she marched straight across the farmyard towards him , to find out . VII WARNING THE ROOSTER " Good Afternoon ! " Henrietta Hen greeted the Rooster . He had not seen her as she walked towards him . And when she spoke he hastily arranged his two long tail-feathers in what he considered a more becoming droop . " Good afternoon , madam ! " he answered -- for the Rooster prided himself that he was always polite to the ladies . " Er -- there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as he noticed an odd gleam in Henrietta Hen 's eye . " Yes -- there is , " she said . The cockerels might fear the Rooster , but Henrietta certainly did n't . She considered him a good deal of a braggart . Indeed , she even had an idea that she could have whipped him herself , had she cared to be so unladylike as to fight . " I 've been bothered for a long time because you crow so early in the morning . You make such a racket that you wake me up every day . " The Booster hemmed and hawed . Somehow he felt uncomfortable . " That 's unfortunate , " he stammered . And then he had a happy thought . " Anyhow , " he continued , with a smile at Henrietta , " you do n't look as if you lacked for sleep , madam . You grow more beautiful every day . " Henrietta Hen admitted that it was so . " But , " she said , " I believe I 'd be even handsomer if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up while it 's dark . So I 'm going to ask you to delay your crowing , from now on , until after sunrise . " " Impossible ! " cried the Rooster . " I 'm sorry to disoblige you , madam . But what you ask ca n't be done . " " That 's just what the cockerel said ! " Henrietta Hen exclaimed . " The cockerel ! " the Rooster echoed angrily . " Which one ? Has one of those upstarts been talking about me ? Point him out to me and I 'll soon teach him a lesson . " Henrietta Hen said that she had n't noticed which cockerel it was . Somehow they all looked alike to her . " Good ! " the Rooster cried . " Then I 'll have to whip them all , to make sure of punishing the guilty one . " He looked very fierce . " Do n't be absurd ! " Henrietta told him . " I asked one of the cockerels to give you a message about not crowing so early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do any good . " " It would n't have done him any good , " the Rooster declared , stamping a foot and thrusting his bill far forward , to show Henrietta Hen how brave he was . " What 's the matter ? " she inquired . " Have you eaten something that disagrees with you ? " The Rooster could n't help looking foolish . Henrietta Hen believed in letting him know that she stood in no awe of him . And while he was feeling ill at ease she hastened to tell him that hereafter he must hold onto his first crow until after sunrise . " I ca n't do that , " he told her again , unhappily . " Do n't you dare let go of it ! " she warned him . " If that first crow gets away from you while it 's dark , there 'll be so many others to follow it that I sha n't be able to close an eye for even a cat-nap . " VIII WHY THE ROOSTER CROWED Henrietta Hen had commanded the Rooster to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that she had made up her mind that he must obey her . But he knew he could n't . And he always took great pains to be polite to the ladies . It was a wonder the Rooster did n't turn red in the face . He had never found himself in such a corner before . " You do n't understand , " he blurted . " I 'd be delighted to oblige you , but if I did n't crow until after the sun rose I 'd never crow again . " " We could stand that , " was Henrietta Hen 's grim reply . " Perhaps ! " he admitted -- for she made him feel strangely humble . " But could you stand it if the night lasted forever ? " " You 're talking nonsense now , " she declared . " You do n't understand , " he told her again . " And I must say I 'm surprised , madam , that you did n't know it was I that waked the sun up every morning . That 's why I crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't know what to say . She thought deeply for a time -- or as deeply as she could . " Have you not noticed , " the Rooster inquired , " that the sun never rises until I 've crowed loudly a good many times ? " " No ! No -- I have n't , " Henrietta murmured . " But now that you speak of it , I see that it 's so . " " Exactly ! " he said . " And often , madam , I have to crow a long time before he peeps over Blue Mountain . It 's lucky I have a good , strong voice , " the Rooster , added with a smirk , for he was feeling more at his ease . " If I had a thin , squeaky crow such as those worthless cockerels have , Farmer Green would have had to do many a day 's work in the dark . " " Goodness ! " Henrietta Hen gasped . " Do crow your loudest the moment you wake up , Mr. Rooster ! Do make all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would . Henrietta left him then . Somehow she could n't get their talk out of her mind . And soon she had an unhappy thought . What if anything should happen to the Rooster 's voice ? The moment that question popped into her head , Henrietta Hen hurried back to the Rooster . " Do be careful ! " she besought him . " Do n't get your feet wet ! For if you caught cold you might be so hoarse that you could n't speak above a whisper . " The Rooster thanked her politely for thinking of his health . " I always take good care of myself , " he assured her . " It looks like rain this minute , " she said as she cast an anxious glance at the sky . " Had n't you better run into the barn ? " He thought otherwise -- and said as much . " You ought to wear rubbers every day , " she chided him , as she went away again . Soon Henrietta returned once more to urge the Rooster to carry an umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came bustling up to him and informed him that a warm muffler about his throat would n't be amiss . There seemed to be no end to her suggestions . And though at first the Rooster had liked to hear them ( without having any idea of following them ) after a time Henrietta 's attentions began to annoy him . " Great cracked corn ! " he exclaimed . " This Henrietta Hen is getting to be a pest . " IX HAUGHTY HENRIETTA Feeling as important as she did , Henrietta Hen liked to have her own way . She said that she could n't be expected to do just as others wished . " I 'll take orders from nobody , " she often declared . " And if I lay eggs for Farmer Green I shall lay them when and where I please . " Henrietta took special delight in laying her eggs in out-of-the-way places . She was never content to lay two in the same nest . " If they left them for me perhaps I 'd feel differently , " she explained to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can find . And if he takes my eggs I 'll make him hunt for them , anyhow . " The older , more staid hens shook their heads when Henrietta talked like that . They told her she was ungrateful . " Farmer Green gives you a snug home and plenty of food , " they reminded her . " And the least you can do is to repay him . You ought not to make trouble by hiding your eggs . " But Henrietta Hen couldn't -- or wouldn't -- agree with them . " It 's all very well for you to talk , " she retorted . " If my eggs were undersized I should n't mind losing them as fast as I laid them . But I lay the biggest and finest eggs to be had . So it 's only natural that I should like to have at least one around to look at -- and to show to callers . " Now , there were plenty of other hens in the flock that laid eggs exactly as big -- or even bigger -- than Henrietta Hen 's . Some of them told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to her . She would n't believe that there were any eggs in the world to compare with hers . So her neighbors learned after a while that they might as well let Henrietta Hen manage her affairs as she pleased . They could n't help hoping , however , that somehow Farmer Green would find a way to outwit her . " What can Henrietta Hen be so boastful about now ? " the hens asked one another one day . " She acts as if she thought more highly of herself than ever . " They soon discovered the reason for Henrietta 's unusually pompous manner . For she began to make calls on all her friends . And she invited everybody to come to her latest nest high up in the haymow . " I 've something there to show you , " she said with an air of mystery . " You 'll be surprised to see it . " Most of Henrietta 's neighbors did not show any great curiosity to see the surprise . They smiled at one another . " She 's laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are always some that ca n't rest until they know everybody else 's business . And it was lucky that Henrietta Hen hurried home to receive her callers , because she had a good many . They came even earlier in the afternoon than was strictly fashionable . And they came in a crowd , too . That , however , did n't bother Henrietta Hen . Nor could they have arrived too soon to suit her . " Look ! " she cried , when they reached her nest high up in the haymow . " Did you ever see anything to beat that ? " X THE BIG , WHITE EGG When Henrietta Hen 's callers crowded about her nest in the haymow they expected to see something wonderful . But when they craned their necks and peered into the little hollowed-out snuggery in the hay they could n't help being disappointed . And when they did n't burst forth with cries of surprise and praise Henrietta Hen looked quite unhappy . " I thought , " she said , " you 'd want to see this egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whiter one than this . " They admitted that the egg was big and that it was very , very white . And if their praise was faint , Henrietta never noticed it . " Are you going to let Farmer Green have that egg ? " one of the company inquired . " No doubt Johnnie Green will grab it as soon as he finds my nest , " said Henrietta with something like a sigh . " If I could only keep this one I would n't care how many others he took . " Polly Plymouth Rock turned to old Whitey , a hen who had come with her to the haymow . " What do you think ? " Polly asked . " Is Henrietta in danger of losing this egg that she thinks so much of ? " " She need n't be alarmed , " old Whitey answered . " If Johnnie Green robs her of this one , I 'll miss my guess . " " Oh ! I 'm glad to hear you say that ! " Henrietta Hen cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what you 're talking about . " That , of course , was a most impolite way for Henrietta Hen to speak to anybody of old Whitey 's age . Whitey was the oldest hen in the flock . And what she did n't know about such things as nests and eggs and roosts was n't worth knowing . Polly Plymouth Rock did n't like Henrietta Hen 's remark . She opened her mouth . And no doubt she would have said something quite sharp in reply . But old Whitey stopped her . " Never mind ! " said Whitey . " The day will come when Henrietta Hen will agree that my guess is a good one . " Still Henrietta Hen felt uneasy about that big , white egg . " I do hope Johnnie Green wo n't find this new nest of mine , " she remarked . " If he does , I fear he 'll take my beautiful egg away from me . " " Lay another ! " said old Whitey . " Lay another and he 'll take that and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well try your scheme , " Henrietta replied , " since nobody suggests anything better . " " My idea 's a good one , or I 'll miss my guess , " said old Whitey . There was some snickering among Henrietta Hen 's callers as they bade her good afternoon and left her . " They 're laughing at old Whitey , " she said to herself . She had n't the slightest notion that they could be giggling at her . " Old Whitey must be wrong , " she thought . " But I may as well take her advice , for I do n't know what else to do . " Not long afterward Henrietta Hen came fluttering down from the haymow , squawking at the top of her lungs for old Whitey . And as soon as she found her , Henrietta cried , " Come up to my nest right away ! I want to ask your advice . " Although she did n't say " Please ! " old Whitey went with her . Illustration : " Come Up to My Nest ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLD WHITEY 'S ADVICE Old Whitey -- the most ancient hen in the flock -- scrambled with some difficulty up to the top of the haymow in Farmer Green 's barn . She could scarcely keep up with Henrietta Hen , whom she was following -- by request . And when she arrived , breathless , at Henrietta 's nest that proud and elegant creature turned a troubled face toward her . " See ! " said Henrietta . " I 've taken your advice and laid another egg . But it 's nothing like the beautiful , big , white one . This last egg is much smaller ; and it 's brown . " Old Whitey nodded her head . " Well ! " she said . " What 's your difficulty ? " " Do n't you think , " said Henrietta , " that if Johnnie Green finds my nest he 'll be sure to take both eggs ? " " No , I do n't , " was old Whitey 's blunt answer . " Then he 'll be sure to take the big , white one , " Henrietta Hen wailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitey told her . " If he does , I 'll miss my guess . " Well , that was really too much for Henrietta Hen to believe . " That boy will never take a little egg and leave a big one , " she declared . " You wait and see if he does n't , " old Whitey advised her . So Henrietta waited . Though she had little faith in old Whitey 's advice , Henrietta could think of nothing else to do . And the next morning , to her great surprise , when Johnnie Green climbed into the haymow and found her nest he took the small brown egg and put it in his hat . And he never touched the big , white egg at all . He did n't even pick it up and look at it ! Perched on a beam overhead Henrietta Hen watched him breathlessly . And as soon as he had gone she went flopping down to the barn floor and set up a great clamor for old Whitey . " What is it now ? " old Whitey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your guess was a good one ! " cried Henrietta Hen . " He came ; and he took the small one . " " There ! " said old Whitey . " I told you so ! I knew Johnnie Green would n't rob you of that big egg . And if you keep laying small eggs in that same nest you 'll find he 'll let you keep the big one . " Henrietta Hen fairly beamed at her companion . " How delightful ! " she exclaimed . " I 've become very , very fond of that big egg . I love to look at it . But there 's another thing that worries me now . If that big egg should get broken --  " " Do n't let that trouble you ! " said old Whitey . " I 'm almost afraid to sit on my nest , " Henrietta Hen confessed . " If the shell of that egg should happen to be thin --  " Old Whitey seemed much amused by Henrietta 's fears . " Let me know if you break it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure . " I 'll be very careful , " Henrietta called after the old dame . XII PLAYING TRICKS Now , the hen known as old Whitey was something of a gossip . She went straight to the farmyard and told everybody what had happened -- what Henrietta Hen had said to her and what she had said to Henrietta Hen . The whole flock had a great laugh over the affair . To Henrietta Hen 's delight , all her neighbors took a keen interest in the wonderful white egg . They asked her countless questions about it . Above all , they always took pains to inquire whether she had been so unlucky as to crack the shell . And if Henrietta had n't displeased Polly Plymouth Rock one day , the truth might never have come out . Anyhow , Polly Plymouth Rock told Henrietta Hen that if she had any sense she would stop making such a fuss over a china egg . " China egg ! " cried Henrietta . " I do n't know what you mean . " " That 's not a real egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock declared . " It 's nothing but a make-believe one . Johnnie Green left it in your nest to fool you , so you 'd keep that nest and lay eggs in it , right along .... You 're so careful not to break that china egg ! Why , if you tried to break it you 'd find that it 's solid as a rock . " Henrietta Hen could n't believe the terrible news . " I laid that egg myself ! " she shrieked . " You think you did ; but you did n't , " Polly Plymouth Rock snapped . " Johnnie Green took an egg of yours one day and left that other one in its place , to deceive you . And everybody on the farm -- except you -- knows that he succeeded . " Henrietta Hen did n't wait to hear anything more . She rushed squalling into the barn and went straight to her nest . One good , hard peck at the big white egg told her beyond all doubt that she had been betrayed . The beautiful , big , white egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hen knew it she wondered how it could ever have deceived her . She saw that it was shiny and altogether unlike any egg she had ever seen anywhere . " Johnnie Green has played a mean trick on me , " Henrietta Hen cackled . " And now I 'll play one on him ! He can have his old china egg . I 'll leave it here for him . But he 'll find none of my beautiful little brown eggs beside it . I 'll have my nest where he 'll never discover it -- not if he hunts for it all summer long ! " So saying , she left the haymow . And going into the carriage shed , her roving eyes chanced to light on an old straw hat of Johnnie Green 's that lay upside down upon a high shelf . Henrietta Hen managed to flutter up beside it . And then with many a chuckle she laid a brown egg in the hat . " There ! " she cackled . " This is the safest place on the farm . Johnnie Green has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " XIII TWO IN A GARDEN Jimmy Rabbit was enjoying a few nibbles at one of Farmer Green 's cabbages . He had n't noticed that there was anybody but himself in the garden . So it startled him to hear a shrill voice cry , " Get out of our garden ! " Jimmy Rabbit jumped . But he did n't jump far , for he soon saw that it was only Henrietta Hen speaking to him . " Why should I get out of our garden ? " Jimmy Rabbit inquired mildly . " I should have said , ' Farmer Green 's garden , ' " said Henrietta Hen . " Thank you very much for the warning ; but I do n't think we need go away just yet -- if old dog Spot is n't sniffing around , " said Jimmy Rabbit . " I do n't believe there 's any danger . " " You do n't understand , " Henrietta Hen cried . " I ordered you out of the garden . " " You ordered me ? " said Jimmy Rabbit , acting as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I 'd like to know when you 're going to obey me . " " It 's easy to answer that , " Jimmy Rabbit replied . " I 'm going away as soon as I 've finished my luncheon . " Nobody could have been pleasanter than he . Yet Henrietta Hen seemed determined to be disagreeable . " I do n't see your lunch basket , " she remarked , looking all around . " No ! " he replied . " I forgot it . I meant to bring one with me and carry a cabbage-head home in it . " Henrietta Hen spoke as if she were very peevish . " You 've no right , " she said , " to take one of the cabbages away with you . " " I 'm not going to , " Jimmy Rabbit explained . " You were nibbling at one when I first noticed you , " Henrietta Hen insisted . " Was I ? " he gasped . " Are you sure you 're not mistaken ? Are you sure you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of the matter was that Henrietta had herself come to the garden to eat cabbage . Really she was no better than he was . But somehow Henrietta Hen never could believe that she was in the wrong . " You 're impertinent , " she told Jimmy Illustration : Henrietta Hen Scolds Jimmy Rabbit . ( Page 62 ) Rabbit in her severest tone . " You know very well that Farmer Green raises these cabbages for home use only . " " Well , " said Jimmy Rabbit , " I 'll make myself at home here , then . " And turning a cold shoulder on Henrietta Hen he began nibbling at a cabbage-leaf once more . Henrietta felt quite helpless . Somehow nothing she could say to the intruder seemed to have the slightest effect on him . And he appeared to be enjoying his luncheon so thoroughly that it made Henrietta Hen very hungry just to see him eat . In spite of herself she could n't resist joining him at luncheon . " Ah ! " he exclaimed between mouthfuls , " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henrietta Hen tried to look very dignified . She pecked at the cabbage in an absent-minded fashion , pretending that it was no treat to her . As a matter of fact , she had been trying to get a taste of cabbage for a long while . And this was the first time she had managed to crawl through the garden fence . " One has to eat something , " she murmured . Jimmy Rabbit smiled slyly . Henrietta Hen could n't deceive him . He knew that she was as fond of cabbage as he was himself . " Did you ever hear it said , " he asked her suddenly , " that eating too much cabbage causes long ears ? " XIV EARS -- SHORT OR LONG Henrietta Hen 's heart began to thump . She dropped a bit of cabbage out of her bill , letting it fall as if it burned her . And usually she was very careful as to her table-manners . " Goodness ! " she said to Jimmy Rabbit , who was busily munching cabbage in Farmer Green 's garden . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange question : " Did you ever hear it said that eating too much cabbage causes long ears ? " And Henrietta Hen did n't want long ears . She knew they would be sure to spoil her beauty . Jimmy Rabbit had no time to say anything more to Henrietta Hen . Although he had not finished his luncheon he left the garden suddenly -- and in great haste . For old dog Spot began barking just beyond the fence ; and Jimmy Rabbit always wanted to get as far from that sound as he could . When Spot scurried into the cabbage-patch a little later Henrietta Hen called to him . " What is it ? " he asked her impatiently . " I 'm in a great hurry . I do n't like to stop . " " This is a very important matter , " said Henrietta Hen . " Do you like cabbage ? " she demanded . " Cabbage ? " he repeated after her as a puzzled look came over his face . " You need n't act so surprised , " Henrietta told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden for nothing . And I have reason to believe that you intended to eat some of Farmer Green 's cabbages . " " What 's your reason ? " old Spot inquired . " You have long ears , " said Henrietta . " Nonsense ! " cried Spot . " What a person eats does n't make his ears either long or short . " " Are you sure of that ? " Henrietta Hen wanted to know . " I 've never eaten cabbage in all my life , " he declared . Still she could n't rid herself of her fears . " Perhaps , " she said , " if you had eaten it your ears would have grown twice as long as they are now . " He shook his head . " I do n't think so , " he muttered . " There 's only one way to find out , " Henrietta announced . " Eat a lot of cabbage -- all you can ! And we 'll soon see whether your ears are growing longer . " But old dog Spot refused flatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears suited him quite well , just as they were . " What ! " Henrietta cried . " Would n't you eat cabbage to oblige a lady ? " Old Spot said he was sorry ; but he had no liking for cabbage . " How can you tell if you 've never tasted it ? " she asked . He made no answer to that question . Instead , he asked her one of his own . " Would you like long ears ? " he inquired . " Certainly not ! " she cried . " How can you tell if you 've never tried wearing any ? " he demanded . " Do n't be stupid ! " she snapped . " None of my family wears ears that can be seen . What a sight I 'd be with long ears ! Ears are very ugly things , and I only hope that I have n't eaten so much cabbage that mine will begin to grow .... Do you suppose they 'd hang down like yours or stick up like Jimmy Rabbit 's ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spot let out a howl . " Jimmy Rabbit ! " he growled . " Was he talking with you just before I arrived ? " " Yes ! " said Henrietta . " It was he that asked me if I had ever heard that eating cabbage made a person 's ears grow . " " I might have known that it was that young Rabbit who put such a silly notion into your head , " Spot grumbled . " If you had n't stopped me I 'd have stopped him by this time .... But it 's too late now . " " You do n't suppose he was joking , do you ? " Henrietta inquired . " Of course he was , " said Spot -- and none too pleasantly . " Well , " Henrietta mused , as she pecked at a cabbage-leaf , " I must say that I think the joke 's on you . " XV HENRIETTA 'S FRIGHT When the old horse Ebenezer stood in his stall in the barn he was always glad to talk with anybody that came along . Henrietta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find a little grain that had spilled on the floor . So it came about that she and Ebenezer had many a chat together . Henrietta had no great opinion of horses . She thought that they had altogether more than their share of grain . But she was willing to pass the time of day with Ebenezer , because he let her walk right into his stall and pick up tidbits that had dropped upon the floor beneath his manger . It was on such an occasion , on a summer 's day , that he said to her with a sigh , " Haying 's going to begin to-morrow . " Henrietta Hen remarked that she was n't at all interested in the news . " And I do n't see why you should sigh , " she added . " Goodness knows you 'll eat your share of the hay -- and probably more -- before the winter 's over . " " It 's the work that I 'm thinking of , " Ebenezer explained . " They 'll hitch me to the hayrake and Johnnie Green will drive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to hear the clatter of the mowing machine , " he groaned . " It means that the hayrake will come out of the shed next . " Henrietta Hen caught her breath . " The mowing machine ! " she gasped . " Is Farmer Green going to use the mowing machine now ? " " Certainly ! " said Ebenezer . " I hear he 's going to harness the bays to it to-morrow morning . " " My ! my ! " Henrietta wailed . " Is n't there any way I can stop him from doing that ? " " I do n't know of any , " Ebenezer told her . " I 've often felt just as you do about it . There 's nobody that dreads hearing the mowing machine more than I do . " " You ca n't feel the way I do , " Henrietta declared . " On the contrary , " the old horse insisted , " I do n't see how it can matter to you in the least . You do n't have to pull the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just tell me that my news about haying did n't interest you ? " " But it does ! " Henrietta cried . " I was mistaken . It means everything to me . It 's the worst news I ever heard in all my life . " Old Ebenezer looked down at her with mild astonishment on his long , honest face . " Why is it bad news ? " he inquired . " If you 'll tell me , perhaps I can help you . " So Henrietta Hen explained her difficulty . Whatever it was , it amazed Ebenezer . And he had to admit that he could think of no way out of the trouble . " It was very , very careless of you , " he told Henrietta . Then suddenly he had a happy thought . " Cheer up ! " he cried . " If Farmer Green sits on them , maybe they 'll hatch . " " Hatch ! " she groaned . " They 'll break ! " And she ran out of the stall and hurried into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green calling to his son Johnnie . " Look here ! " said he . " I started to oil the mowing machine so I could use it to-morrow ; and just see what I found in the seat ! " Johnnie Green came a-running . And there in the seat of the mowing machine , nestling in the hay which had been put there for a cushion the summer before , three eggs greeted Johnnie 's eyes . " They must belong to the speckled hen , " Johnnie decided . " I knew she 'd stolen her nest again . I could n't find it anywhere . " He picked up the eggs and put them in his hat . " She 's a sly one , " he said . That remark made Henrietta Hen somewhat angry . At the same time she was glad that Farmer Green had discovered the eggs before it was too late . She would n't have liked him to sit on them . It always upset her to see her eggs broken . XVI THE ROOSTER UPSET During the summer Henrietta Hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , she always came a-running at feeding time . But except when there was something there to eat , she did n't go near the henhouse . She " stole her nest , " to use Johnnie Green 's words , now in one place and now in another . And at night she roosted on any handy place in the barn or the haymow , under the carriage-shed or even over the pigpens . However , when the nights began to grow chilly Henrietta was glad enough to creep into the henhouse with her companions . She always retired early . And being a good sleeper , she slept usually until the Rooster began to crow towards dawn . Of course now and then some fidgetty hen fancied that she heard a fox prowling about and waked everybody else with her squalls . Such interruptions upset Henrietta . After the flock had gone to sleep again Henrietta Hen was more than likely to dream that Fatty Coon was in the henhouse . And she would squawk right out and start another commotion . Luckily such disturbances did n't happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the henhouse . And Henrietta would dream only of pleasant things , such as cracked corn , or crisp cabbage-leaves , or bone meal . After dreams of that sort Henrietta could n't always be sure , when the Rooster waked her with his crowing , that she had n't already breakfasted . But she would peck at her breakfast , when feeding time came , and if it tasted good she would know then that the other food had been nothing but a dream . One night , soon after she had gone back to roost in the henhouse , it seemed to Henrietta that she had scarcely fallen asleep when the Rooster crowed . She awoke with a start . " Goodness ! " she exclaimed under her breath . " I must have slept soundly , for I have n't dreamed a single dream all night long . " Then she noticed that none of the other hens had stirred . " Lazy bones ! " Henrietta remarked to the Rooster . " You wo n't get ' em up in a hurry . They , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she received no answer . " He could n't have heard me , " she said to herself . So she repeated her speech in a louder tone . And still the Rooster made no reply . Henrietta could n't understand it , he was always so polite to the ladies . Could it be that he was snubbing her ? Henrietta grew a bit angry as that thought popped into her head . " What 's the matter ? " she snapped . " Have you lost your voice ? It was loud enough to wake me up a few moments ago . " Receiving no response whatsoever , Henrietta completely lost her temper . " I 'll see what 's wrong with you ! " she cackled . And throwing herself off her roost , though it was dark as a pocket in the henhouse , she flung herself upon the perch just opposite , where she knew the Rooster had slept . It was no wonder that Henrietta Hen blundered in the dark . It was no wonder that she missed her way and stumbled squarely into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a terrible clamor . And he made Henrietta Hen angrier than ever , for he cried out in a loud voice something that would have displeased anybody . " A skunk is after me ! " he bawled . XVII A SIGN OF RAIN There was a terrible hubbub in the henhouse . The Rooster squalled so loudly that he waked up every hen in the place . And when they heard him crying that a skunk had knocked him off his roost they were as frightened as he was , and set up a wild cackle . All but Henrietta Hen ! She knew there was no skunk there . " Do n't be a goose -- er -- do n't be a gander ! " she hissed to the Rooster . " I 'm the one that bumped into you . " The Rooster quickly came to his senses . " Do n't be alarmed , ladies ! " he called to the flock . " There 's no danger . There 's been a slight mistake . " He pretended that he had n't been scared . But he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hen . He feared he was in for a scolding from her . " If you had answered me when I spoke to you I would n't have left my perch in the dark , " she told the Rooster severely . " When I moved to your perch to see what was the matter I blundered into you . And then you thought I was a skunk ! You owe me an apology , sir ! " The Rooster was glad it was not lighter in the henhouse , for he felt himself flushing hotly . " You must pardon me , " he said . " I had no idea it was you , for you waked me out of a sound sleep . " " Sound sleep , indeed ! " Henrietta Hen exclaimed with a sniff . " Why , you had been crowing only a few moments before . In fact it was your crowing that roused me . " " No doubt ! " said the Rooster . " But you see , I fell asleep again immediately . " " Then you must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never known you to go to sleep again , once you 've begun your morning 's crowing . " " But it 's not morning now , " the Rooster informed her . " It 's not even late at night -- certainly not an hour since sunset . " Henrietta Hen was astonished . " I noticed that the night seemed short , " she muttered . The Rooster thought it a great joke . " Ha ! ha ! " he laughed . And he said to the rest of the flock , with a chuckle , " Henrietta thought it was morning ! No doubt she 'd have gone out into the yard if the door had n't been shut . " And the other hens all tittered . They always did , if the rooster expected them to . Well , if there was one thing that Henrietta Hen could n't endure , it was to be laughed at . " Do n't be silly ! " she cried . " Why should n't I think it was morning , when he crowed almost in my ear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rooster asked her . And without waiting for any reply , he said , " I crowed to let Farmer Green know it was going to rain to-morrow . " Of course Henrietta Hen had to have the last word . The Rooster might have known she would . " Then , " she observed , " I suppose you squawked to let him know there was a skunk in the henhouse . " XVIII IN NEED OF ADVICE Something was troubling Henrietta Hen . She seemed to have some secret sorrow . No longer did she move with her well-known queenly manner among her neighbors in the farmyard . Instead , she spent a good deal of her time moping . And no one could guess the reason . She did n't even care to talk to anybody -- not even to boast about her fine , speckled coat . And that certainly was not in the least like Henrietta Hen . Always , before , Henrietta had seized every chance to parade before the public . Now she seemed to crave privacy . What was the matter ? To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to that question . That is to say , she did not know why a certain thing was so . She only knew that a great misfortune had befallen her . And she dreaded to tell anybody about it . To be sure , there was old Whitey -- a hen who had lived on the farm longer than any other . Most members of the flock often asked her advice . Even Henrietta herself had done that . But this difficulty was something she did n't want to mention to a neighbor . If there were only somebody outside the flock to whom she could go for help ! But she knew of no one . Then Henrietta happened to hear of Aunt Polly Woodchuck . The Muley Cow , who went to the pasture every day , mentioned Aunt Polly 's name to Henrietta . According to the Muley Cow , Aunt Polly Woodchuck was an herb doctor -- and a good one , too . No matter what might be troubling a person , Aunt Polly was sure to have something right in her basket to cure it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But I ca n't go way up in the pasture , under the hill . " " Could you go to the end of the lane ? " the Muley Cow inquired . " Yes ! " " Then I 'll ask Aunt Polly Woodchuck to meet you by the bars to-morrow morning , " the Muley Cow promised . That suited Henrietta Hen . " I 'll be there -- if it does n't rain , " she agreed . Early the next day she followed the cows through the lane . And she had n't waited long at the bars when Aunt Polly Woodchuck came hobbling up to her . Being a very old lady , Aunt Polly was somewhat lame . But she was spry , for all that . And her eyes were as bright as buttons . Henrietta Hen saw at once that Aunt Polly was hopelessly old-fashioned . She carried a basket on her arm , and a stick in her hand . " Well , well , dearie ! Here you are ! " cried Aunt Polly Woodchuck . " The Muley Cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about yourself ! No doubt I 've something in my basket that will do you a world of good . " Illustration : " Do n't Worry ! " Said Aunt Polly Woodchuck . ( Page 91 ) XIX AUNT POLLY HELPS Somehow Henrietta Hen could n't help liking Aunt Polly Woodchuck , in spite of her old-fashioned appearance . She certainly had a way with her -- a way that made a person want to tell her his troubles . " I do n't know whether you can help me or not , " said Henrietta Hen . " Have you any feathers in your basket ? " " No -- no ! No feathers ! " Aunt Polly replied . " I use herbs in my business of doctoring . But I 've heard that a burnt feather held under a body 's nose will do wonders sometimes .... I must always carry a feather in my basket , hereafter . " " One feather would n't do me any good , " said Henrietta Hen with a doleful sigh . " I need a great many more than one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! " Henrietta answered . " Half my feathers have dropped off me . And that 's why I 've come to ask your advice . I 'm fast losing my fatal beauty . " Henrietta Hen 's voice trembled as she told Aunt Polly Woodchuck the dreadful news . " I do n't believe you 'll be able to help me , " she quavered . " I 'll soon look like a perfect fright . Besides , winter 's coming ; and how I 'll ever keep warm with no feathers is more than I know . " Henrietta Hen could n't understand how Aunt Polly managed to stay so calm . Henrietta had expected her to throw up her hands and say something like " Sakes alive ! " or " Mercy on us ! " But the old lady did nothing of the sort . She set her basket down on the ground ; and pushing her spectacles forward to the end of her nose , she leaned over and looked closely at Henrietta Hen . Aunt Polly 's gaze travelled over Henrietta from head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of Henrietta 's feathers and gave it a gentle twitch . " Look out ! " Henrietta cried . " You 'll pull it out if you 're not careful . And I ca n't afford to lose any more feathers than I have to . " " Do n't worry ! " Aunt Polly Woodchuck advised her . " Cheer up ! There 's nothing the matter with you . You are molting . You are going to get a new outfit of feathers for winter . Your old ones have to fall out in order to make room for the new . And no doubt the fresh ones will be much handsomer than the old . " Henrietta could n't believe that Aunt Polly knew what she was talking about . " I ca n't be molting as early in the fall as this , " she protested . " I 've never got my winter feathers so soon .... I fear you 're mistaken , " she told Aunt Polly . " Oh , no ! I 'm not mistaken , " Aunt Polly Woodchuck insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you noticed that the wheat grew big this year , and that the bark on young trees is thick ? And have n't you observed that Frisky Squirrel is laying up a great store of nuts in his hollow tree , and that the hornets built their paper houses far from the ground this summer ? " Henrietta Hen 's mouth fell open as she stared at Aunt Polly Woodchuck . And when the old lady paused , Henrietta looked quite bewildered . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " she murmured . " I do n't see what all this has to do with molting . " " Some of those signs , " Aunt Polly explained , " mean an early winter ; and some of ' em mean a cold one . I 've never known ' em to fail . And you 're molting early so you 'll have a good warm coat of feathers by the time winter comes . " Well , Henrietta Hen began to feel better at once . She actually smiled -- something she had not done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " You 're a fine doctor , Aunt Polly . I do n't wonder that folks ask your advice -- especially when there 's nothing the matter with them ! " And then Henrietta Hen hurried off down the lane . Being timid about hawks , she never felt quite comfortable far from the farmyard . XX A GREAT FLURRY There was a great flurry among Farmer Green 's hens . They all insisted on talking at the same time , because they had heard an astonishing bit of news . It was about Henrietta Hen . Wherever she went her neighbors craned their necks at her , just as if they had n't seen her every day for as long as they could remember . Henrietta Hen enjoyed the notice that everybody took of her . She went to some trouble to move about a good deal , so that all might have a chance to stare at her . For if there was one thing she liked , it was attention . There was a reason why Henrietta had suddenly become the most talked-of member of the flock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she expected to take all her children with her . There was n't the least doubt that it was all true . The whole flock had heard Johnnie Green and his father talking about it . Of course everybody asked Henrietta Hen a great number of questions . When was she going to leave ? How long did she expect to stay at the fair ? What did she intend to do there ? Would she wear her best clothes if it rained ? There was no end to such inquiries . Unfortunately , Henrietta Hen could answer very few of them . Never having visited a fair , she had no idea what a fair was like . She only guessed that when the time came , she and her family would be put into a pen , loaded upon a wagon , and jolted over the road that led to the fair , wherever it might be . But Henrietta did n't intend to let her neighbors find out how little she knew about fairs . She said that before starting she expected to wait for the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it lasted ( because she did n't want to miss anything ! ) and that she intended to come home when the wagon brought her . Furthermore , she planned to wear her best apron , anyhow , because there was sure to be fair weather at a fair ! How could it be otherwise ? Old Ebenezer , the horse , told her to be sure to see the races . " They 're the best part of a fair , " he said . " In my younger days I used to take part in them . " And then he added , " There 's nothing else at a fair that 's worth looking at . " " What about the poultry show ? " Henrietta Hen asked him . She did n't know what poultry shows were ; but she had heard Farmer Green mention them . " I never paid any attention to the poultry exhibit , " the horse Ebenezer replied . " I never took part in that . I suppose it might interest you , however . " Henrietta Hen smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polly Plymouth Rock , who stood near her , that she did n't believe the old horse knew a race from a poultry show . " If he ever went to a fair , I dare say he was hitched outside the fence , " she sniffed . Polly Plymouth Rock cackled with amusement . And she said something that displeased Henrietta Hen exceedingly . " Are you going to take that duckling that you hatched out ? " she asked . " Certainly not ! " Henrietta snapped . " Please -- Miss Plymouth Rock -- never mention him again ! I 'm going to the fair , among strangers . And I should n't care to have them know about that accident that happened to me -- not for anything ! " XXI OFF FOR THE FAIR It seemed to Henrietta Hen that the time for the fair would never come . She had begun to feel somewhat uneasy , because she had talked so much about visiting the fair with her children that it would be very awkward if she did n't go . So she was delighted one day by the noise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the wagon-shed . A merry noise it was , to Henrietta 's ears ; for she guessed at once what was happening . Farmer Green and his son were building a pen in which she and her family were to ride to the fair ! The news spread like fire in sun-dried grass . Henrietta Hen took pains that it should . She told everybody she saw that she expected to leave at any moment . And she began to say good-by to all her friends . Since Henrietta did n't start for the fair that day , before nightfall she had bade every one farewell at least a dozen times . And when , the following dawn , Henrietta started the day not by saying " Good morning ! " but by bidding her neighbors " Good-by ! " once more , they began to think her a bit tiresome . " What ! Have n't you gone yet ? " they asked her . " No ! But I expect to leave at any moment , " Henrietta told them . She was so excited that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such trouble . And perhaps it was just as well that Henrietta Hen had her hands full looking after them and trying to keep them all under her eye , and spick-and-span for the journey . Otherwise she would have been in more of a flutter than she was . While Henrietta had an eye on her children , she tried to keep the other on the barn . And after what seemed to her hours of watching and waiting , she saw Johnnie Green lead the old horse Ebenezer out of the door , with his harness on . Henrietta promptly forgot her stately manners . She ran squalling across the farmyard and called to Ebenezer , " Where are you going ? " " I understand that I 'm going to the fair , " he told her , as Johnnie Green backed him between the thills of a wagon . " Once I would have been hitched to a light buggy , with a sulky tied behind it . But now I 've got to take you and your family in this rattlety old contraption . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned and hurried back , to gather her youngsters and bid everybody another farewell . Amid a great clucking and squawking , Johnnie Green and his father put Henrietta and her chicks into the pen and placed it in the back of the wagon . " We 're all ready ! " Henrietta cried to Ebenezer . The old horse did n't even turn his head , for he could see backwards as well as forwards , because he wore no blinders . He made no direct reply to Henrietta , though he gave a sort of grunt , as if the whole affair did not please him . He knew that it was a long distance to the fairgrounds and the road was hilly . " She thinks it a lark , " he said to the dog Spot , who hung about as if he were waiting for something . " She 's lucky , for she wo n't have to go on her own legs , for miles and miles . " " That 's just what I intend to do , " Spot informed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to follow you , right under the wagon , where Johnnie Green and his father ca n't see me . " So they started off . And they had scarcely passed through the gate when Henrietta began to clamor in her shrillest tones . But nobody paid any heed to her . The wagon clattered off down the road . And old dog Spot smiled to himself as he trotted along beneath it . " Henrietta just remembered that she forgot to put on her best apron , " he chuckled . XXII ALMOST HOMESICK Never in all her life had Henrietta Hen seen so many hens and roosters and chicks as she found on every side of her , at the fair . Farmer Green and his son Johnnie had set her pen in the Poultry Hall . And to Henrietta 's surprise , none of her new neighbors paid much attention to her and her chicks -- at first . She soon decided that there was a reason for this neglect . She made up her mind that she would have to make herself heard amid all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily Henrietta had a strong voice . She used it to the utmost . And it was n't long before a huge hen in a pen next hers gave her a bold look and asked , " What are you here for ? " " I 've come to get the first prize , " Henrietta answered calmly . She had listened carefully to what Farmer Green and Johnnie had said to each other during the journey from the farm . And already she knew something about fairs . Her new neighbor laughed right in Henrietta 's face . " I do n't see how you can win the first prize , " she said with a sniff . " I 'm going to get the first prize myself . There never was another such fine family as mine . " She glanced proudly at her chicks as she spoke . " The best you can hope for , " she told Henrietta , " is the second prize . And you 'll be lucky if you get the third . " For once Henrietta Hen was at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever been at a fair before , " her new neighbor observed . Henrietta admitted faintly that she had n't . " Last year I won second prize , " said the other . " I 'd have had the first if the judges had known their business . " Henrietta Hen began to feel very shaky in her legs . She had expected a different sort of greeting , when she should arrive at the fair . She had thought everybody would exclaim , " Here comes Henrietta Hen ! What a fine family of chicks she has ! And are n't Mrs. Hen 's speckles beautiful ? " And there she was , with nobody paying any heed to her , except the lofty dame in the next pen , who had said nothing very agreeable . " Oh , dear ! " Henrietta sighed . " I wish I 'd never left home . " " What 's that ? " her neighbor inquired in a sharp tone . " You are n't homesick , are you ? " " N-no ! " said Henrietta . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I do n't know what my friends will say when I come back home without it . " " Well , everybody ca n't win it , " said her new acquaintance . " Not the same year , anyhow ! " And then she looked Henrietta up and down for a few moments , while Henrietta squirmed uneasily . " Where do you come from ? " she asked at last . " I live on Farmer Green 's place , in Pleasant Valley , " Henrietta informed her . The lady in the next pen shook her head . " I 've never heard of Pleasant Valley , " she remarked , " nor of Farmer Green . He must be small potatoes . " Well , Henrietta was astonished . She began to feel as if she were nobody at all . She had supposed that everybody knew of Pleasant Valley -- and of Farmer Green , too . As for the remark , " small potatoes , " she did n't understand it at all . So she inquired what it meant . " It means , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of much account . " That speech made Henrietta Hen almost lose her temper . " Mr. Green , " she cried , " is a fine man . And I 'll have you know that I would n't live anywhere but on his farm ! " XXIII GETTING ACQUAINTED Not liking her neighbor on her right , at the fair , Henrietta Hen sidled up to the wire netting on the opposite side of her pen . Peering through it , she examined the person whom she saw just beyond , in a pen of her own . A very sleek hen was this , who gave Henrietta a slight nod . " We may as well speak , " she said , " since we 're to live next to each other for a week . " " A week ! " Henrietta groaned . " Shall I have to stay cooped up here as long as that ? " " Yes ! " said Neighbor Number 2 . " And I do n't blame you for feeling as you seem to . A week is a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand her . " I 'm going to win the first prize -- with my chicks , " Neighbor Number 2 announced . " Of course that 's worth waiting here a week . " " I do n't see how you can win the first prize ! " Henrietta exclaimed . " Why not ? " demanded the other . And she pressed against the wire netting of her pen and stuck her head through it as far as she could , as if she would have pecked Henrietta had she been able to . " Because --  " Henrietta explained --  " because the lady on the other side of me is going to win it . " " Who said so ? " " She did , " Henrietta answered . " Ha ! ha ! " cackled Neighbor Number 2 . " That 's a good joke . She has n't any more chance of winning than -- than you have ! " Now , Henrietta Hen could n't help being puzzled . But whoever might win the first prize , she was sure it could n't be she . Had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her that she could n't win ? Henrietta would have felt quite glum , except that she could n't very well mope in the midst of the terrific racket all about her . Soon her neighbors -- both Number 1 and Number 2 -- were having loud disputes with the hens in the pens on the further side of them . It seemed as if every hen at the fair had left her manners at home -- if she ever had any . " Goodness ! " Henrietta Hen murmured to herself . " If there 's a prize , it must be for the one that can make the most noise . " In a little while throngs of men , women and children crowded into the Poultry Hall . They paused before the pens and looked at the occupants , making remarks that were sometimes full of praise and sometimes slighting . Henrietta Hen felt terribly uneasy when people began to stop and stare at her . She dreaded to hear what they would say . After the way her next-door neighbors had talked to her she did n't believe anybody would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of remarks about herself . Some said she was too little and some said she was too big ; others exclaimed that her legs were too short , while still others declared that they were too long ! As these -- and many similar -- comments fell upon Henrietta 's ears she promptly decided that there was n't anything about her that was as it should be . Having always called herself ( before she left home ) a " speckled beauty , " she began to feel very low in her mind . And there was only one thing that kept her from being downright sad . All the sightseers agreed that she had some pretty chicks . Henrietta could n't help wishing that they had a different mother -- one that was worthy of them . XXIV WINNING FIRST PRIZE Henrietta Hen was waiting as patiently as she could for the fair to come to an end . She tried to close her ears to the boasts of her neighbors on either side of her , that they were going to win the first prize . She had heard too many unpleasant remarks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize at all -- let alone the first . " Anyhow , we 'll be going home tonight , " Henrietta said to herself . " And I 'll never , never , never come to another fair . I 'll go and hide ' way up high in the haymow where they ca n't find me before I 'll spend another week in a place like this . " While she was muttering under her breath like that some men came up to her pen . And Henrietta Hen promptly squatted down in the furthest corner of it , hoping they would n't say anything disagreeable about her . She felt that she had already heard about all she could stand . She did n't even look at her callers . And soon they moved away . Then Henrietta glanced up . She noticed something blue dangling from the front of her pen . And there was a greater commotion than ever on all sides of her . " What is it ? " she cried . " What has happened ? " Neighbor Number 1 , on her right , shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she spluttered . " They 've made a terrible blunder . They 've gone and given you and your chicks the first prize . And of course it was meant for me and mine ! " " It was n't ! " screamed Neighbor Number 2 ( on Henrietta 's left ) . " That prize was intended for me and my children ! " " Who won second and third ? " cried a noisy hen from across the way . " They 're both at the other end of the hall ! " somebody shrieked . " It 's an outrage ! It is n't fair ! We 've been cheated ! " Henrietta Hen 's nearest neighbors clamored . But nobody paid any attention to them . As for Henrietta , she did n't quite know how to act . She had intended , when she left home , to do a good deal of strutting back and forth in her pen , with now and then a pause to preen herself , to make sure that she looked her best . But somehow she no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . She remembered that some of the other hens at the fair had been haughty and proud and had smoothed their feathers , declaring boldly that they expected to win the first prize . Henrietta had heard it said that fine feathers do n't make fine birds . And she knew at last what that meant . It meant that gay clothes and lofty ways and boastful talk were of no account at all . So Henrietta tried to behave as if nothing unusual had happened . She told her chicks that they were going home that evening , and that she would be glad to be back on the farm again , among plain home-folks . At last Johnnie Green and his father came to load Henrietta and her family into the wagon . " Well , " said the old horse Ebenezer to Henrietta . " Did you enjoy the races ? " " I did n't have a chance to see them , " she replied . " That 's a pity , " he told her . And then he asked her , " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That --  " said Henrietta --  " that means that my chicks won the first prize . " " She helped win it herself , " cried old dog Spot , who was yelping about the wagon . " Our little speckled hen was the best hen at the fair ! " " Nonsense ! " Henrietta exclaimed . But , all the same , she could n't help being pleased .
