Code Plus <P> Sirs : <P> May I call your attention to the fact that when your department of RELIGION , TIME , Feb. 28 , p. 22 , explains the assertion that Christianity is " primarily a way of life " by the inserted note , " i. e. a moral code , " it is far from doing justice to the persons quoted . They might without hesitation appeal to the New Testament itself , for when Jesus said , " I am the way . . no one cometh unto the Father but by me , " He surely did not mean that He was a moral code . When Paul wrote , " It is no longer I that live , but Christ liveth in me , " he was not , of course , professing indifference to morals , but he was " primarily " emphasizing a spiritual experience which he found more fruitful , in ethics and elsewhere , than any " code " could be . <P> I trust this letter does not intrude unduly . The courteous welcome you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME deserves and receives . <P> EDWARD S. WORCESTER <P> Theological Seminary , New Brunswick , N.

OAKLEY <P> " Peppist " <P> Sirs : <P> I have noticed that TIME is a bond between strangers . <P> Why not have a button to wear in the lapel or on the dress bearing a proper symbol , and representing TIME-readers . I 'm sure most of us subscribers would like to know that the man we meet is an up-to-the-moment " peppist , " and we would be glad to pay a nominal price for such buttons or insignias . <P> WAYBREN L. TRACY <P> Worthington , Ohio <P> Gorgas , Not Goethals <P> Sirs : <P> In your story of Mr. John F. Stevens ' recent trip to the Isthmus of Panama ( TIME , Feb. 28 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Goethals " conquered the greatest foe of his predecessors , yellow fever . " <P> Among those who are familiar with the history of the construction of the Panama Canal , credit for the eradication of yellow fever from the Isthmus is given principally to the late General W. C. Gorgas . It detracts nothing from the honor due General Goethals as a great engineer , a great organizer and a great executive , to give General Gorgas the honor due him , and in the name of the thousands of his fellow countrymen who love and respect his memory , I ask that you will do so . <P> HARRY D. REED <P> Judge , Superior Courts Waycross , Ga . <P> Hiccoughs <P> Sirs : <P> ... I read TIME from cover to cover , and it helps me in various ways .
