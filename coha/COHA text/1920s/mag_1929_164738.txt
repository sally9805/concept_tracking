The Senate Lobby Committee last week continued its pursuit of persons who seek to influence federal legislation by fair means or foul . Chief incidents of the pursuit were : <P> Investigator . Back into service as a Senate investigator was brought redheaded , freckled-faced John G. Holland , 30 , a Prohibition attorney for the U. S. in New York . Five years ago as a clerk in the office of Senator Thomas J. Walsh of Montana , Mr. Holland hounded out most of the secret facts which revealed the naval oil scandals . <P> Sugar Trail . Last fortnight was revealed a domestic ( beet ) sugar lobby to raise the duty on this commodity . Last week the Senate huntsmen ran to earth an opposition lobby , representative of Cuban ( cane ) sugar interests , bent on keeping this tariff rate down . The cane men had been spending dollar for dollar-$75,000 per year-to keep even with the beet men . <P> Herbert Conrad Lakin of Manhattan , president of Cuba Co. , a $165,000,000 holding company controlling plantations , mills , railroads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admitted that he had lobbied , that he had received no pay for his services , that the job was " very distasteful " to him . Eleven Cuban companies as cash contributors had combined to maintain the cane sugar lobby at Washington and Mr. Lakin said he was drafted to head it , though he confessed that he was " a poor mixer . " <P> Lobbyist Lakin said he had been in Washington eight months , had seen twelve Senators , nine Congressmen on sugar rates . His practice was to explain who he was , what he represented and then supply " facts and figures " to Senators who would receive them . Under him also was a large and active press-agency for low sugar rates . Cane sugar interests Mr. Lakin regretted to say , would be " up against it " unless ' they had a Washington lobby . <P> Into the Lakin testimony crept one famed name-Major-General Enoch Herbert Crowder , retired , administrator of the War draft and onetime ( 1923-27 ) U. S. Ambassador to Cuba . According to Mr. Lakin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machado of Cuba , had , on leaving the country , been asked by that high official to do all he could to protect Cuban sugar interests . General Crowder had gone to Washington as Lobbyist Crowder , had vainly attempted to patch up a tariff agreement between foreign and domestic sugar producers . For his efforts he received " a small stipend " from Cuban sugar mills . <P> " Old Joe . " Most famed of tariff lobbyists is Joseph ( " Old Joe " ) R. Grundy , president of Pennsylvania Manufacturers ' Association , wealthy worsted yarn-spinner of Bristol . Last week he appeared before the lobby committee . A Quaker , he admitted that his belief in a sky-high protective tariff is " next to my religion . " He made no bones about his occupation , for he has been lobbying before Congress for high tariffs since the Dingley ( 1897 ) bill . His tariff ethos : <P> Domestic manufacturers contribute cash to political campaigns in which a high tariff is pledged . The election won , manufacturers expect a return on their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To see that they get it , to insure the fulfillment of campaign promises , is the moral mission in life of such lobbyists as Mr. Grundy.
