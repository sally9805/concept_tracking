0UR attitude toward innovations has always been one of encouragement : we are noted for our tolerance . Blind advocacy of a futile dream , however , is stupid and uneconomical . Realizing this , we are seriously thinking of withdrawing our support of the telephone . We watched its development and growth with hope , but we now suspect that as an invention to make life less difficult it is a failure . Central frankly admits her ignorance of the numbers we are calling . On the rare instances when she does not , either we get a busy buzz like the contented droning of eternity or we get an incredibly wrong number . We are told that the Waldorf Astoria does n't answer . Over a period of two hours and a half we are informed ten times that the telephone at our home is busy and then finally gain an admission from the " manager 's office " that it is really out of order . In one-tenth the time taken in this effort we could have dispatched a small colored boy on a mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have under consideration , in fact , a plan to substitute small colored boys on mules for the telephone , as a means of speeding up communication . WE had just completed a well-pondered editorial lamenting the passing of night life in New York when the newspapers arrived with the report that a painted figure of a nude woman had appeared mysteriously on the sign in front of Mr. Sumner 's Vice Society . This hit close home . Our editorial on no night life began to look thin and silly . One sentence we recall clearly : " After midnight , " it began , " there is no unforced gaiety in the town  --  drollery and mirth are dead . " Yet persons in the neighborhood of Twenty-second Street testified they had seen a man climbing a ladder in the dawn , and we could only conclude ? much against our wishes that his gaiety , as he climbed , was unforced . Mr. Sumner would be glad if he were caught and arrested . Here at last our aims coincide with the aims of the vice chief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typed editorials ridiculous overnight , and rendering thorn unfit for publication . ONE thing leads to another , and we ca n't help thinking that vice is nor what it used to be . Lots of things are not what they used to be . Look back over this summer  --  heat is not what it used to be . And the thought keeps recurring to us that possibly Mr. Sumner , feeling vice slipping , painted the gay sign himself , in order to have something worth suppressing . It 's just possible . WITH little or no surprise. , we read that Uldine Utley , the girl evangelist , paused in the Pennsylvania Station , on her arrival in town , long enough to hold a revival meeting . This was understandable . Evangelists habitually play on the emotions of the persons they are seeking to save ; and our belief is that Miss Utley must have come upon a group of Long Island commuters and realized that they not only looked decidedly lost as they prepared to entrain , but were so emotionally overwrought anyway that her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tame po-liceman 's horse , deserted for the moment by his master , is always too much for elderly ladies , little boys , and men who are openly kind to animals . The good beast , faithful to duty , must stand perfectly still and submit to the vilest sort of patronage from this sudden ring of admirers , who stroke his neck wantonly , talk baby talk to him , and offer him candy ? when all he wants , unquestionably , is to be allowed to live his own life until the boss gets back . Efficiency IN a somewhat sallow yesterday , I when none of its readers was under ninety or the influence of the Twentieth Century , the Evening Post was known as " the old lady of Vesey Street , " because of its prissiness . Its filing system , now in the process of reorganization , still bears reminders of this . Not long ago , it is related , there was occasion in the office to look up clippings of the Wall Street explosion . The hunt immediately became complicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Explosions , " " Disasters , " Bombs " or even " Reds . " Finally they telephoned to the home of the former archivist , retired .

" " Ah , " said the old gentleman , " look in the letter M cabinet . You will find it tinder ' Mishaps .

Now Jefferson Market is to give way to a house of detention and hospital for women . Though never the scene of a Revolutionary battle , it has been a landmark of some importance . It was in 1833 that the market was established on the triangle formed by Greenwich Avenue , Sixth Avenue and Tenth Street . The principal reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a long , roundabout walk to the Tompkins Market on Fourth Street . Jefferson Market was a frame building with six butchers ' stands at the start , but in 1836 a produce market was added . It has figured in no interesting history since , although conditions which arose within its walls shortly after its erection were responsible for the earliest of the independent butcher shops which now dot the city . When it was built the only butchers permitted to operate were in the public markets , the authorities licensing only those obtaining market stalls . Shortly after Jefferson Market was established graft naturally appeared . It seems that one of the prison keepers next door was the man to see . He could always get an applicant a stall if the hid was substantial . Finally one Charles Oakley , in revolt , built a wooden shed across the street and offered stalls at half the city 's rate . The authorities immediately pounced upon him , but the resultant investigaAUGUST 27 , 1927 tion revealed so much that eventually independent butcher shops outside market walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jefferson Market Court and Prison , adjoining , were to come down ; but such is not the case . There are times when we find its red-brick towers and angled buttresses slightly hideous , but we can not forget that until very recently it housed the Women 's Night Court , one of the most picturesque things of the city . We reconcile ourself to the tower , even though its clock is almost never right . Its site has a tradition . Here stood for forty years one of the watchtowers of the city , in which day and night sat a gentleman who scanned the horizon for curling smoke and , sighting it , rang the bell that turned out the dashing volunteer fire brigades . The bell , incidentally , now hangs in the Jefferson Market Court tower , five tons heavy and eight feet from rim to rim , but it has n't been sounded since it was hung there . Beau Brummell AMONG the recent arrivals on this shore is an eminent British boxer who prides himself on his clothes and the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are informed , he was overheard by a young American lady to remark that American fighters were not all they might he sartorially , and the maiden was constrained to insist that Mr. Mickey Walker was something of a well-dressed man , and likewise Gene Tunney . " They both look very well in dinner coats , " she added . " Yeah , " said the British pugilist , " but when I wear dinner coats they got tails to One Black Crow IT is interesting , at the moment , to I find that the outlying wapentakes are discovering , through the medium of a phonograph record , the languid drolleries of Moran and Mack . And it is high time , we feel , that we removed their burnt cork for the benefit of our clients . The task is made simpler by the fact that the team , for biographical purposes , is n't exactly bipartite . Moran , it seems , like Lorelei Lee 's London , really is n't anything . There is , to be sure , a Moran . He is the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alTHE NEW YORKER 11 ways the same Moran and , off the program , he is n't even always a Moran . The original Moran , we are informed , has a habit of dropping out of the picture from time to time . On these occasions Mack simply drafts another feeder and keeps right on going . Fully a dozen times this has happened since the firm name was established . MACK , then , is what he himself would call " the head man with that show . " He is Charles E. Mack and he came by his drawl naturally , in Texas , where he was born and where he spent most of his early life . Schools were n't much in Texas then , but the boy must have learned to count up to twelve at an early age , for his mother was without a clock , it seems , and would send him over to hear the town clock strike . He would come hack and report the number of chimes , and thus she regulated the household . Most of Mack 's playmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialect and theirdances . He finally found he could make money with these and drifted into tank-town vaudeville . Eventually he reached Chicago , where he worked in a saloon and cabaret run by Bob Moots , who was Chicago 's " Nigger Mike . " There he met the colored comedian , Bert Williams , who gave him a great deal of professional assistance . Just as he was brushing up his dancing he met Moran and they formed a vaudeville team . Seventeen years ago they made their first appearance in New York at ninety dollars a week . They have been drifting here and there in vaudeville since and came into their first New York popularity a few years ago in a revue . Last year they clinched their place by their success in the " Vanities . " At the moment they are touring the Pacific Coast in vaudeville tinder a contract that calls for several thousand dollars a week .

Presented A YOUNG man now in the city is returned but recently from sev-eral years in Serbia , where his father has a diplomatic post . During his early days in the Near East the diplomat 's son was not a little impressed by an occasional glimpse of King Feisal of Irak . Some time after his arrival he concluded that he should like to be presented to the King and , looking toward this , sought out the British High Commissioner at his office . " Surely , " said that official , " I 'll be ? ? " Shall I get you a taxi , sir ? " " No , thanks , I 'm just looking around . " glad to arrange it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted his telephone and put in his call . Then he turned to the young American and inquired : " What do you want him for ? tea , dinner or tennis ? " The young man , making a quick decision , suggested tennis , and the next afternoon had the pleasure of meeting His Highness on the courts . Taxi Fraternity TAXICAB drivers , whose drolleries have supplied us from time to time with amusing moments , continue to entertain us as we get about town . Making a hurried exit from one cab last week , at the Pennsylvania Station , we found to our dismay , when we were well on our way to Long Island , that we had left two hooks in the taxi . One of them contained half a dozen unmailed letters . Fretting about our carelessness we arrived home late that night to discover that the driver , remembering the number of the house from which we had emerged to hail him , had travelled the long way back ( about eighteen blocks ) and left the books in the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , " I mailed your letters . " No name was signed . It pained us to remember that we had tipped the gentleman but ten cents , and we can only hope to hail him again . On another occasion our driver , who had run far past the deadline at a Sixth Avenue crossing , was ordered to back up by a particularly upstanding and trimly turned-out traffic cop . When the officer walked back to his post the chauffeur turned to our party with the succinct critique : " Brand-new cop  --  not a speck of dust on him . " Fortunately the officer did not hear , and we were delayed no longer . This same driver , turning east on Twenty-fourth Street , suddenly directed our attention to the moon , ris ing crimson and beautiful before us . " There 's a picture for you ! " he cried , and , inquiring if we had a minute ( which we had ) , he drew up at the curb and allowed us to view the spectacle . This reminded a lady in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyscraper fire of some months ago  --  and another taxi-man . This chap , it seems , took her seven blocks out of her way home ( turning the meter flag down ) because she wanted to watch the blaze .

A fair , a very fair , young lady and her escort took their seats just before one of the Wightman Cup matches in which Miss Helen Wills was playing , and immediately after the referee had admonished the assemblage : " Ladies and gentlemen , the spectators are requested not to applaud during rallies .

" Malthus on Broadway iss KITTY MARION is undoubted- ly enough of an institution to warrant a few paragraphs in these pages . Miss Marion is the lady who of recent years has been seen about the streets by everybody in town , selling the Birth- Control Review . She is of German birth , it turns out , despite her name , which is n't her original one . She dropped her family cognomen when she ran away from home and went to England at the age of fifteen . Her ambition was to go on the stage and this she fulfilled to a certain extent . She made her debut as a dancer when eighteen years of age and afterward appeared in several dramas . Once , too , she tried to get a job as a rider with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show . Mr. Cody had announced that he wanted to recruit some female riders in England but , although she rode well , she did n't get a chance for a tryout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their mounts that the showman gave up the whole idea . About this time Miss Marion became interested in the suffrage movement and to it she devoted several energetic years . We are told that she helped set fire to the Hurst Park grandstand , threw bricks through the windows of the Home Office , and had to be forcibly fed two hundred and fifty times . Once she was honored by a visit from Queen Mary 's personal representative , the Duchess of Bedford , who urged her to stop starving . She got her first experience in magazine salesmanship by selling suffrage publications . Miss Marion came to the United States when the war began , having neglected to swear her allegiance to the Vaterland . She had intended to resume her dramatic career but was again diverted by a Cause . After hearing a lecture by Margaret Sanger she zealously took up the birth control movement . She thereupon began selling the Review . Now she takes her stand every morning at ten , both hands held high and a Review in each . One day it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Broadway in the Forties . She has sold 86,478 copies , as of the first of August , we are informed , and all told has had much success and little trouble . Once an Irish lady engaged her in a one-sided fencing match with an umbrella , once some of Billy Sunday 's followers denounced her publicly as immoral , and upon one occasion the Vice Society had her arrested . She has come through each experience unscathed , however , and last month she even sold a copy of her magazine to a policeman . Talk AGENTLEMAN who was recently a luncheon guest at Mr. Coolidge 's summer residence has provided another illustration of our President 's amazing verbal frugality but , at the same time , evidence that he will spare a few words to keep the records straight . There were six at table and they had sat in complete silence through the soup . Growing restless , and finally desperate , our friend eventually essayed to start a conversation . " Mr. Coolidge , " he said , " you must get a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come  --  by air mail ? " " Special pouch . " Mr. Coolidge spoke without looking up . " Oh , yes , " put in Mrs. Coolidge with a smile , " we get a great deal of mail  --  even books and magazines if we write for them . " " Not , " said the President firmly in reply , " by special pouch . " " Oh , no , " said Mrs. Coolidge , " I did n't mean they came by special pouch . " " You implied it , " said the President . Our friend made no further effort at small talk . License O often have we made the L automobile license numbers the subject of our roving interest that our readers will not be surprised that we went busily to work last week upon the hot tip that there is a gentleman whose town car bears the same number as his town house . After a few hours of work we dug up the facts . The gentleman is Mr. Kenneth O'Brien , Mr. Mackay 's son-in-law . The plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 East Eighty-sixth Street . Rather neat , we think . Habit THE yoke of prohibition is hard to throw off , and escape to a freer land does n't always bring relief , we are advised by a gentleman who spent the summer in France . He tells us of a travelling companion of his who hails from a Middle Western town where the Volstead Act is , every now and then , rigorously enforced . This gentleman , after a gay afternoon on Paris cafe terrasses , a dinner with champagne , and another round of the sidewalk cafes for liqueurs , told the waiter at his last stopping place to wrap him up a couple of quarts of champagne . The waiter did . The gentleman then headed for his hotel . He found it difficult to stay out of the middle of the street , however , and shrieking automobile horns finally attracted a gendarme , who went to his assistance . He led the American to a sidewalk chair and was about to touch his cap and walk off when the Middle Westerner passed him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused our hero to lose his balance . Quickly the gendarme encircled him with his arms and pulled him to his feet . He held him tightly for a moment to insure his recovery of his equilibrium and then loosened his grip . The American promptly gave him another hundred francs , whereupon the amazed gendarme hurried off  --  presumably for fear he would wake up and find that it was n't true . Half an hour later the wanderer reached his hotel room  --  and his roommate , who relates the story . Carefully placing the two bottles of champagne in the wash basin , the purchaser turned to his friend and said , " Cos ' me seven ' - five francs bottle and two hun'erd more to oil a cop . " Zoo UPat the zoo one hot afternoon this summer the bath water of one of the elephants was cut off when the pipe line broke . This was tough on the animal 's keeper , who had to keep the elephant supplied with water by carrying it in a pail . The tap was a good distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckets heavy , but doggedly the faithful keeper stuck to his task . Perspiring and gasping , he would stagger to the animal with a full pail only to see the contents instantly siphoned out and dissipated in spray . For hours this had kept up . The keeper was on his fortieth or perhaps his fiftieth trip , when , passing the cage in which was confined a hippopotamus , he was stopped by a lady . She was a stoutish lady , firm of disposition . " My man , " she said , " can you tell me whether that is a male hippopotamus or a female hippopotamus ? " Then the worm turned . The keeper set down his pail . He regarded the lady coldly . His tone was metallic . " Madam , " he said , " I do n't see how that could interest anyone but a hippopotamus . "
