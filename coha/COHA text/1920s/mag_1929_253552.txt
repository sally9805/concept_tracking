A shrill and crackling hail greeted Herbert Hoover when he and Mrs. Hoover joined Thomas Alva Edison 's 82nd-birthday party at the Edison estate near Fort Myers , Fla. , early last week . It was deaf Mr. Edison yelling : " Hello , fisherman ! " <P> Then there was a general shaking of hands and a few posings with Mr. Edison standing between his cronies , Motor-Man Henry Ford and Tire-Man Harvey Samuel Firestone , his hands affectionately around their shoulders . Mr. Hoover , sauntering across the street to telephone , saw a group of little girls looking sad because , they thought , they were not permitted to dance at Mr. Edison 's party . Mr. Hoover opened Mr. Edison 's gate and sent the children in . On Mrs. Edison 's ample table was a big green- &-yellow; pound cake . This the old gentleman sliced with skill and raillery . <P> As is usual at his parties , Mr. Edison had an aphorism and a statement to make . <P> The aphorism : " I am not acquainted with anyone who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those States bordering on the Gulf of Mexico can grow plant rubber with profit to the farmer , in case of war prices . But it might be possible in the future to grow rubber and compete with the tropics . I have found over 1,200 plants to produce rubber . About 40 of them will be cultivated on a large scale . " <P> Henry Ford has a 22,000-acre plantation near Savannah , Ga. , and on it he is cultivating some of his friend 's rubber plant selections . Mr. Ford has a rubber tree plantation newly started in Brazil . Mr. Firestone has his own plantation going in Liberia . These and other intimates of Mr. Edison possess little chunks of spongy brown material-Edison 's first rubber from U. S. weeds . <P> Another feature of Mr. Edison 's birthday was a gesture of generosity by Mr. Ford . At Dearborn , Mich. , Ford 's factory town , stands the Edison Institute of Technology and the Museum of American Industries , dedicated to Mr. Edison . Mr. Ford last week endowed institute and museum with $5,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in working order . <P> At the dedication of the Dearborn memorials , Mr. Edison , Mr. Ford and a group approached the buildings to enter . Near the door was a fresh-laid sheet of concrete , around which the party started to walk . But not Mr. Edison . Always he takes the short cut and across the concrete he walked . It was soft . His shoes sank into it . Consternation came upon his face , then stubbornness . He plodded ahead leaving a string of footprints behind . Mr. Ford was delighted and said something flattering about " the sands of time . " He gave orders that the footprints be allowed to harden , furthermore , he made Mr. Edison take off his shoes and leave them in the museum . <P> At Dearborn , also , there is being reconstructed the brick laboratory in which , at Menlo Park , N. J. , Thomas Alva Edison invented the incandescent bulb 50 years ago . That golden anniversary will be celebrated nationally on Oct. 21.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
