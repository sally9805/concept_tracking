Y ou might suppose that popular literature was a modern invention . Cultivated shoulders shrug at the mention of " best sellers " with that air of " the world is going to the devil " which just now is annoyingly familiar . Serious-minded people write of " The Saturday Evening Post " as if it represented some new fanaticism destined to wreck civilization . The excessive popularity of many modern novels is felt to be a mystery . Of course there are new elements in literary popularity . The wave of interest used to move more slowly . Now thousands , and sometimes millions , read the popular story almost simultaneously , and see it a little later on the films . Millions of the class that never used to read at all are accessible to print , and have the movies to help them . But popularity has not changed its fundamental characteristics . The sweep of one man 's idea or fancy through other minds , kindling them to interest , has been typical since communication began . The Greek romances of Heliodorus may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Winter Comes . " " Pilgrim 's Progress " and " The Thousand and One Nights " could serve as models for success , and the query , What makes popularity in fiction ? be answered from than with close , if not complete , refererence to 1922 . However , the results of an inquiry into popularity will be surer if we stick to modern literature , not forgetting its historical background . Human nature , which changes its essence slowly through the centuries , nevertheless shows rapid changes of phase . The question I propose , therefore , is , What makes a novel popular in our time ? I do not ask it for sordid reasons . " What makes a novel sell a hundred thousand copies , or a short story bring a thousand dollars ? " may seem the same query ; but it does not get the same answer , or , apparently , any answer valuable for criticism . A cloud descends upon the eyes of those who try to teach how to make money out of literature , and blinds them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are nearly worthless . They purpose to teach the sources of popularity , yet instead of dealing with those fundamental qualities of emotion and idea that , as I hope to show , make popularity , their tale is all of emphasis , suspense , beginnings , and endings , the relativity of characters , dialogue , setting ; useful points for the artisan , but not the secret of popularity , or , it may be added , greatness in literature . Technic is well enough , ? in fact some technic is indispensable for a book that is to be popular , ? but it is the workaday factor in literature . Of itself it accomplishes nothing . But technic can be taught . That is the explanation of the hundred books upon it , and their justification . You  | can not teach a perception of the heart , or observation , or sympathy , or the background of knowledge which makes possible the interpretation and selection of experience ? not at least in a lesson a week for nine months . Hence literary advisers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes against their better judgment , to write books on technic by which criticism profits little . Technical perfection becomes their equivalent for excellence and for popularity . It is not an equivalent . More than a mason is required for the making of a statue . I disclaim any attempt to teach how to be popular in this essay , although deductions may be made . I am interested in popularity as a problem for criticism . I am interested in appraising the pleasure to be got from such popular novels as " The Age of Innocence , " " Miss Lulu Bett , " " If Winter Comes , " or " The Turmoil , " and the not infrequent disappointments from others equally popular . I am especially interested in the attempt to estimate real excellence ? an attempt which requires that the momentarily popular shall be separated from the permanently good ; which requires that a distinction be made between what must have some excellence because so many people like it , and what is good in a book whether many people like it or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , but it can at least refine judgment and deepen appreciation . ? 2 As for popularity and its meaning , there need be no quarrel over that term . Let us rule out such accidents as when a weak book becomes widely known because it is supposed to he indecent , or because its hero is identified with an important figure of real life , or for any other casual reason . If a novel , because of the intrinsic interest of its story or on account of the contagion of the idea it contains , is widely read by many kinds of readers , and if these readers on their own initiative recommend the book they have read to others , that is popularity , and a sufficient definition . Perfection of form is not enough to make a book popular . A story has to move , or few will read it ; but it is doubtful whether a greater technical achievement than this is required for popularity . " Samson Agonistes " is technically perfect , but was never popular , while , to pass from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise " was most crudely put together , and yet was deservedly popular . The best-built short stories of the last decade have not been the/ most popular , have not even been the best . No popular writer but could have been , so I profoundly believe , more popular if he had written better . But good writing is not a specific for unpopularity . The excellent writing of Howells could not give him Mark Twain 's audience . The weak and tedious construction of Shakspere 's " Antony and Cleopatra , " the flat style of Harold Bell Wright 's narratives , have not prevented them from being liked . Form is only a first step toward popularity . Far more important is an appeal to the emotions , which good technic can only make stronger . But what is an appeal to the emotions ? " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " appealed to the emotions , and so does " Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford . " To what emotions does the popular book appeal ? What makes " Treasure Island " popular ? Why did  | " Main Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Treasure Island " is popular because it stirs and satisfies two instinctive cravings of mankind , the love of romantic adventure and the desire for sudden wealth . This is not true , or , rather , it is not the whole , or even the important , truth in " Main Street . " There the chief appeal is to an idea , not an instinct . We left the war nationally self-conscious as perhaps never before , acutely aware of the contrasts between our habits , our thinking , our pleasures , our beliefs , and those of Europe . When the soldiers oversea talked generalities at all , it was usually of such topics . The millions that never went abroad were plucked from their Main Streets , and herded through greater cities to the mingled companionship of the camps . " Main Street , " when it came to be written , found an awakened consciousness of provincialism , and a detached view of the home town such as had never before been shared by many . Seeing home from without was so general as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And upon this new conception , this prejudice against every man 's Main Street , the book grasped , and thrived . In like manner " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " grew great upon its conception of slavery . " Robert Elsmere " swept the country because of its exploitation of freedom in religious thought . No one of these books could have been written , or would have been popular if they had been written , before their precise era ; no one is likely long to survive it except as a social document which scholars will read and historians quote . Roughly , then , the emotional appeal which makes for popularity is either to the instinctive emotions permanent in all humanity , though changing shape with circumstances , or to the fixed ideas of the period , which may often and justly be called prejudice . A book may gain its popularity in either way , but the results of the first are more likely to be enduring . " Paradise Lost , " the least popular of popular poems , still stirs the instinctive craving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the splendors of its verse . Dryden 's " Hind and the Panther , " which exploited the prejudices of its times and was popular then , is almost dead . ? 3 What are these instinctive cravings that seek satisfaction in fiction and , finding it , make both great and little books popular ? Let me list a few without attempting to be complete . First in importance is probably the desire to escape from reality into more interesting life . This is a foundation , of course , of all romantic stories and is part of the definition of the romantic ; but it applies to much it literature that is not usually regardec as romance . A more interesting lift than yours or mine does not mean on ( we should wish actually to live , other wise it would be difficult to account for the taste in detective stories of many sedentary bank presidents ; nor does i mean necessarily a beautiful , a wild , romantic life . No , we wish to escape to any imagined life that will satisfy desires suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . The desire to escape is eternal ; the variety differs with the individual mar and still more with the period . While youthful love , or romantic adventure  | as in " Treasure Island , " has been an acceptable mode for literature at least as far back as the papyrus tales of the Egyptians , more precise means of delivery from the intolerable weight of real life appear and disappear in popular books . In the early eighteen hundreds men and women longed to be blighted in love , to be in lonely revolt against the prosaic well-being of a world of little men . Byron was popular . In the Augustan age of England classic antiquity was a refuge for the dreaming spirit ; in Shakspere 's day , Italy ; in the fifteenth century , Arthurian romance . Just at present , and in America , the popularity of a series of novels like " The Beautiful and Damned , " " Erik Dorn , " and " Cytherea " seems to indicate that many middle-aged readers wish to experience vicariously the alcoholic irresponsibility of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country-club rakes who threw the pilot overboard as soon as they left the war zone , and have been cruising wildly ever since . We remember that for a brief period in the England of Charles II , James II , and William and Mary , rakishness in the plays of Wycherley and Congreve had a glamour of romance upon it and was popular . Indeed , the novel or drama that gives to a generation the escape it desires will always be popular . Test Harold Bell Wright or Zane Grey , Rudyard Kipling or Walter Scott , by this maxim , and it will further define itself , and ring true . Another human craving is the desire to satisfy the impulses of sex . This is much more difficult to define than the first , because it spreads in one phase or another through all cravings . Romance , of course , has its large sex element , and so have the other attributes to be spoken of later . However , there is a direct and concentrated interest in the relations between the sexes which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast of personalities in love , in its cruder forms demands passion in the raw , in its pathological state craves the indecent . A thousand popular novels illustrate the first phase ; many more , of which the cave-man story , the desert-island romance , " The Sheik , " and its companions are examples , represent the second ; the ever-surging undercurrent of pornography flows to meet the third . Many sex stories are popular simply because they satisfy curiosity , but curiosity in a broader sense is a human craving which deserves a separate category . Popular novels seldom depend upon it entirely , but they profit by it , sometimes hugely . A novel like Dos Passos 's " Three Soldiers , " Mrs. Wharton 's " Age of Innocence , " or Mrs. Atherton 's " Sleeping Fires " makes its first , though not usually its strongest , appeal to our curiosity as to how others live or were living . Curiosity is a changeable factor , a sure play for immediate popularity , but not to be depended upon for long life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are curious about Russia , the South Sea Islanders , and night life on Broadway ; to-morrow it may be New Zealand and Australia , the Argentine millionaire , and quite certainly the Chinese and China . Books appealing to the craving for escape have a longer life , for a story that takes a generation out of itself into fairy-land keeps some of its power for the next . Nevertheless , the writer who guesses where curious minds are reaching and gives them what they want puts money into his purse .  | A fourth craving , which is as general as fingers and toes , is for revenge . We laugh now at the plays of revenge before " Hamlet " where the stage ran blood , and even the movie audience no longer enjoys a story the single motive of which is physical revenge . Blood for blood means to us either crime or rowdyism ; and yet revenge is just as popular in literature now as in the sixteenth century . However , its aspect has changed . Our fathers are not butchered in feuds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war or in street robberies we are not insulted by brute physical force . Nevertheless , we are cheated by scoundrels , oppressed by financial tyranny , wounded by injustice , suppressed by self-sufficiency , rasped by harsh tempers , annoyed by snobbery , and often ruined by unconscious selfishness . We long to strike back at the human traits which have wronged us , and the satiric depiction of hateful characters whose seeming virtues are turned upside down to expose their impossible hearts feeds our craving for vicarious revenge . We dote upon vinegarish old maids , selfrighteous men , and canting women when they are exposed by narrative art , and especially when poetic justice wrecks them . The books that contain them bid high for popularity . It happens that the last twelve months have seen three novels in which this element of popular success was strong : Miss Sinclair 's " Mr. Waddington of Wyck , " " Vera , " by the author of " Elizabeth " in her German garden , and Mr. Hutchinson 's " If Winter Comes . " The first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them superior force ; but it is noteworthy that " If Winter Comes , " which adds other popular elements in large measure to its release of hate , has been financially the most successful of the three . To these deep cravings or the heart must be added another of major importance . I mean aspiration , the deep desire of humanity to be better , nobler , finer , truer . Stories of daring in the face of unconquerable odds , stories of devotion , above all stories of self-sacrifice , are made to gratify this emotion . They are purges for the restless soul . Some critic of our short story discovered not long ago that the bulk of the narratives chosen for reprinting had self-sacrifice as theme . This is precisely what one would expect of comfortable , ease-loving peoples , like the Germans before the empire and the Americans of our generation . When no real sacrifice of goods , of energy , of love , or of life is necessary , then the craving for stories of men who give up all and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualistic stories of selfish characters ? Ben Hecht 's for example , and Scott Fitzgerald 's ? have been written after a war period of enforced self-sacrifice and by young men who had actually suffered for a cause . But most American readers of our generation live easily and have always lived easily , and that undoubtedly accounts for the extraordinary popularity here of aspiring books . The fictitious hero of our kind who suffers for others , when applied to our imagination , is a tonic for our conscience , and , like massage , takes the place of exercise . By a twist in the same argument it may be seen that the cheerful optimist in fiction who , Pollyanna-wise , believes all is for the best , satisfies the craving to justify our well being . I do not , however , mean to disparage this element of popularity . It  | is , after all , the essential quality of tragedy , where the soul rises above misfortune . It is a factor in noble literature as well as in popular success . ? 4 So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for satisfaction and are the causes of popularity . To them may be added others , of course , notably the desire for sudden wealth , which is a factor in " Treasure Island , " as in all treasure stories , and the prime cause of success in the most popular of all plots , the tale of Cinderella , which , after passing through feudal societies with a prince 's hand as reward , changed its sloven sister for a shopgirl , and King Cophetua into a millionaire , and swept the American stage . To this may also be added simpler stimulants of instinctive emotion , humor stirring to pleasant laughter , pathos that exercises sympathy , the happy ending that makes for joy . Stories which succeed because they stir and satisfy these , or any of the emotions which I have described , are like opera in a foreign tongue , which moves us even when we do not fully understand the reason for our emotion . They differ from another kind of popular story , in which a popular idea rather than an instinctive emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each generation has its fixed ideas . A few are inherited intact by the generation that follows , a few are passed on with slight transformation , but most crumble or change into different versions of the old half-truths . Among the most enduring of prejudices is the fallacy of the good old times . Upon that formula nine tenths of the successful historical romances are built . That American wives suffer from foreign husbands , that capital is ruthless , that youth is right and age wrong , that energy wins over intellect , that virtue is always rewarded , are American conceptions that have given short , but lofty , flights to thousands of stories . More important , however , in the history of fiction are those wide and slow-moving currents of opinion , for which prejudice is perhaps too narrow a name , that flow so imperceptibly through the minds of a generation or a whole century that there is little realization of their novelty in comparison with the thought of past ages . Such a slow-moving current was the humanitarianism which found vigorous expression in Dickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as a theme by novelist after novelist to-day , or the sense of the value of personality and human experience that intensely characterizes the literature of the early Renaissance . If a novel draws up into itselfrone of these ideas , filling it with emotion , it gains , perhaps , its greatest assurance of immediate popularity . If the idea is of vast social importance , this popularity may continue . But if it is born of immediate circumstance , like the hatred of slavery in " Uncle Tom 's Cabin , " or if it is still more transient , the novelty of a new invention , like the airplane or wireless , then the book grows stale with its theme . The like is true of a story that teaches a lesson a generation is willing to be taught ; it lives as long as the lesson . What has become of Charles Kingsley 's novels , of the apologues of Maria Edgeworth ? " Main Street " is such a story ; so was " Mr. Britling Sees It Through , " so , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . at their hearts .  | Perhaps it is already clear that most popular novels combine many elements of popularity , although usually one is dominant . Among those stories , for instance , which I have mentioned most frequently , " Main Street " depends upon a popular idea , but makes uses also of the revenge motive . It does not contain , as many hasty critics said , an appeal to curiosity . We know our Main Streets well enough already . And therefore in England , which also was not curious about Main Streets , and where the popular idea which Sinclair Lewis seized upon was not prevalent , the book has had only a moderate success . " If Winter Comes " combines the revenge motive with aspiration . Scott Fitzgerald 's first novel made its strong appeal to curiosity . We had heard of the wild younger generation and were curious . His second book depends largely upon the craving for sex experience , in which it resembles Mr. Hergesheimer 's " Cytherea , " but also plays heavily upon the motive of escape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story of revenge . Booth Tarkington 's " Alice Adams , " to bring in a new title , is a good illustration of a story where for once a popular novelist slurred over the popular elements in order to concentrate upon a study of character . His book received , it is true , a tardy popular recognition , but it disappointed his discriminating admirers . The popular story , then , the financially successful , the immediately notorious story , should appeal to the instinctive emotions , and may be built upon popular prejudice . What is the moral for the writer ? Is he to lay out time possible fields of emotion as a surveyor prepares for his blue print ? By no means . Unless he follows his own instinct in the plan , or narrates because of his own excited thinking , he will produce a thinly clad formula rather than a successful story . There is no moral for the writer ; only some rays csf light thrown upon the nature of his achievement . The way to accomplish popularity , if that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let formula , once it is understood , take care of itself . As an editor wise in popularity once said to me , " Oppenheim and the rest are popular because they think like the people , not for them . " ? 5 What is the moral of this discussion for the critical reader ? A great one , for if he does not wish to be tricked constantly by his own emotions into supposing that what is timely is therefore fine , and what moves him is therefore great , he must distinguish between the elements of popularity and the essence of greatness . It is evident ; I think , from the argument that every element of popularity described above may be made effective upon our weal human nature with only an approximation to truth . The craving for escape may be , and usually is , answered b3 sentimental romance , where every emotion from patriotism to amorous , ness is mawkish and unreal . Every craving may be played upon in the same fashion just because it is a craving , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exaggeration . Also it is notorious that a prejudice ? or popular idea , if you prefer the termthat is seized upon for fiction is almost inevitably strained beyond logic and beyond truth , so much so that in rapid years , like those from 1916 to 1920 which swept us into propaganda any out again , the emphatic falsity of  | book 's central thesis may be recognized before the first editions are exhausted . We have always known , of course , that a novel can be highly popular without being truly excellent . Nevertheless , it is a valuable discipline to specify the reasons . And it is good discipline also in estimating the intrinsic value of a novel to eliminate as far as is possible the temporal and the accidental , and in particular the especial appeal it may have to your own private craving ; for each of us has his soft spot where the pen can pierce . On the contrary , if the highly speculative business of guessing the probable circulation of a novel ever becomes yours , then you must doubly emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , analyze them out of the narrative , and equate them with the tendencies of the times , the new emotions stirring , the new interests , new thoughts abroad . Yet in eliminating the accidental in the search for real excellence it would be disastrous to eliminate all causes of popularity with it . That would be to assume that the good story can not be popular , which is nonsense . The best books are nearly always popular , if not in a year , certainly in a decade or a century . Often they spread more slowly than less solid achievements for the same reason that dear things sell less rapidly than cheap . The best books cost more to read because they contain more , and to get much out , the reader must always put much in . Nevertheless , the good novel will always contain one or more of the elements of popularity in great intensity . I make only one exception , and that for those creations of the sheer intellect , like the delicate analyses of Henry James , where the appeal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual emotion . Such novels are on the heights , but they are never at the summit of literary art . They are limited by the partiality of their appeal , just as they are exalted by the perfection of their accomplishment . They can not be popular , and are not . The " best seller , " therefore , may be great , but does not need to be . It is usually a weak book , no matter how readable , because ordinarily it has only the elements of popularity to go on , and succeeds by their number and timeliness instead of by fineness and truth . A second-rate man can compound a best seller if his sense for the popular is first-rate . In his books the instinctive emotions are excited over a broad area , but rapidly sink again . No better examples can be found than in the sword-and-buckler romance of our nineties , which set us all for a while thinking feudal thoughts and talking shallow gallantry . Now it is dead , stone dead ; not even the movies can revive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much the same is true of books that trade in prejudice , like the white-slave stories of a decade ago . Thus the profitable ship popularity can be kept upright for a little voyage with a light ballast of prejudice or sentiment , and this , prevailingly , is all her cargo . But the wise writer , if he is able , as Scott and Dickens and Clemens were able , freights her more deeply . As for the good reader , he will go below to inspect before the voyage begins ; or , if in mid-career he likes not his carrier , take off in his mental airplane and seek another book .  |
