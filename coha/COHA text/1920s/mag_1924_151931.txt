A fortnight ago the New York Herald-Tribune had a great " beat . " The headline ran : " New Yorkers Drink Sumptuously on 17,000-Ton Floating Cafe at Anchor Fifteen Miles off Fire Island " ( TIME , Aug. 25 , NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Other newspapers echoed the story 24 hours later , being careful to credit the Herald-Tribune with its origin . Many readers of these other newspapers felt that the credit had been given in sincere admiration for so great a " beat , " - credit where credit was due . <P> But there was more than admiration between the scrupulous credit lines . There was caution as well , lest the great " beat " were not true . Indeed the more sophisticated of Manhattan 's dailies- The News ( gum-chewers ' sheetlet ) and the great New York World , either through intuition or spectacular scepticism , maintained the attitude from the first that the cafe ship was a dream ship . <P> None the less , Reporter Sanford Jarrell of the Herald-Tribune , who had brought in the " beat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotes , had gained his superiors ' , attention , for better or for worse . They questioned him , congratulated him , sent him off for further copy about his alcoholic argosy . <P> This time the details he sent in were skimpy , vague . Meanwhile other reporters could find no trace of all Jarrell had seen . Revenue cutters , scouring the seas , towed nothing to port . Suspicion grew . Haled to the Herald-Tribune sanctum , Jarrell was questioned again . He stuck to his story , begged leave to bring substantiating evidence , left the office . The next mail brought a full confession that his " sea cabaret " was a myth . Sore at heart , the Herald-Tribune apologized to the public and to the other Manhattan newspapers ; posted Sanford Jarrell 's name on the bulletin board as " dishonorably dismissed . " On reporters ' benches the country over there was much moralizing on the futility of trying to rise to journalistic fame through the overuse of one 's imagination . Jarrell , unmarried , in his early 30 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a newspaper atmosphere . He has been in journalism about ten years , " which makes it all the more extraordinary . " He bore a reputation for industry and reliability . He covered the N. Y. State Legislature for his paper last Winter . An outcast from journalism , he was reported to be " contemplating moving pictures as a means of self-expression . "
