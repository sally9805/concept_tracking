In the domain of Shah Muhammed Hasan Mirza , until April Valiahd ( Crown Prince ) of Persia , when his brother Ahmed was dethroned ( TIME , Apr. 7 ) , the plebs were adverse to having pictures taken of their religious observances , particularly when there were any women round . <P> It so happened that a crowd of Persians were giving vent to their spleen in holding meetings of hostility to the Bahaists , religious sect . Allegedly before a sacred fountain in Teheran , capital of Persia , one of these meetings was taking place . Along came U. S. Vice Consul Major Robert W. Imbrie and another American by the name of Melin Seymour , in a carriage . Before the fountain they stopped and took some pictures . Immediately the crowd rushed upon the Americans , crying out that they were Bahaists . They dragged them from the carriage , cut them , beat them . In vain did native servants of missionaries explain that the Americans were not Bahaists . The police were powerless to stop the infuriated mob . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken to a hospital in a critical condition . <P> The tragedy was the culmination of recent anti-foreign demonstrations aimed principally at the British . At the temporary funeral of the Vice Consul , the American Church in Teheran was packed full . There were present the Serdar Sepah ( Reza Khan ) , Premier of Persia , and members of his Cabinet , the Court Minister of Ceremonies , all the members of the Persian Parliament , representatives of all the foreign legations ( except Russia ) and most of the European colony . Mrs. Imbrie is to bring her husband 's body back to the U. S. in the near future . Hundreds of arrests were made by the Persian police in connection with the murder . <P> The Persian Government instructed its Charg d ' Affaires in Washington to express to the Government of the U. S. its deepest regrets over the " unfortunate accident " and to state that everything would be done to bring the guilty persons to justice . The message indicated , however , that " the Imbrie and Seymour accident was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persisting in taking pictures . The police and army forces which went to protect them , when they were attacked by the mob , received serious injuries . Three policemen were mortally wounded and one of the soldiers died a few hours later as a result of injuries received by him . " <P> The U. S. State Department announced that pending an enquiry , begun under the direction of Under Secretary Joseph Grew , Acting Secretary of State in the absence of Charles E. Hughes , no formal action will be undertaken to obtain redress by the U. S. Government .
