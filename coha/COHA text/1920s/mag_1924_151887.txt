*Little French Girl <P> Old Dog Tray Becomes the Fairy Prince <P> The Story . Madame Vervier was an exquisite person . Her salon in Paris , her garden at Cannes , her sunny cottage on the cliffs of Brittany were filled with other exquisite persons- savants , artists , connoisseurs of life . Madame Vervier was a powerful person , important to all who knew her , all important to more than one . If she left her husband for a lover and then had other loves , that was courageous as well as reckless . If she forfeited her position in le monde , that was her affair . Madame Vervier lived true to her lights ; and they were clear , honest lights . <P> But there was Alix , her daughter , a grave , dark child in her mid-teens . Alix spent half the year with her father 's father , the remainder with Maman , under the terms of the divorce . Tradition , strongest in the outcast , dictated innocence for a jeune fille ; ultimately a husband , un foyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and beautiful , had its fierce dangers , its pain . A mother seeks to spare her daughter these-and Madame Vervier was a devoted mother . <P> There was no question of Alix 's innocence . Maman had many friends , was resourceful as well as exquisite . When Captain Owen Bradley , their charming English visitor at Cannes , visited them in Paris on his leaves from the front , all three laughed and made merry together . He talked much about " Toppie , " waiting for him at home and showed them her saintly face in a locket . He talked of how Alix would see Toppie and all his family , in England , after the War . <P> Then Captain Owen was killed . To pay a debt of hospitality and to hoard more memories of him , his family asked Madame Vervier to let them have Alix for the Winter . To keep Alix innocent and to put her in the way of a safe marriage , Madame Vervier was more than willing . <P> The Bradleys were like bread and butter , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain and philosophic younger brother , worshipped the austere Toppie hopelessly . He made Alix feel wonderfully safe . When Alix discovered that Maman had been more to Captain Owen than Toppie had been , and that he had betrayed them both by not telling his family of the Paris visits , life would have been unbearable without Giles ' understandstanding . He went with her to France , met Maman , understood her too . He saw how necessary a safe English marriage was for Alix and , with the fidelity of Old Dog Tray , led her back to England to find one . But Alix was no longer a jeune fille . When Jerry Hamble , utterly eligible , proposed , she was too anglicized to marry him without loving him . Besides , everyone found out about Maman 's irregularities . There was nothing to do but return to France and stand by Maman in the inevitable tragedy of her advancing years . <P> Thus all hung for a moment upon Toppie .
