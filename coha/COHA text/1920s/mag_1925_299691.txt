A face known to all followers of U.S. sport peered over a fence in Lexington , Ky. , with a certain wistfulness apparent in the droop of the long-veined nose , the expression of the black-circled eyes . It is true that the owner* of this countenance has for some time been leading a life of considerable luxury , but it was in no way responsible for the melancholy that saddened his visage . His regret was caused by the fact that his father and mother were at that moment being sold at auction in a meadow three miles away . No one was so heartless as to describe that scene to him : the 3,000-odd onlookers , bidders , the group of old stallions , sway-backed mares , shaggy , spindling colts-remnants of the famed stable of the late August Belmont , being sold by a red-faced auctioneer . No one told him of the prices : how his father , Fair Play , went to Joseph E. Widener for $100,000 ; his mother , Mahubah , brought a miserable $8,000 ; his friends Dona Rocca and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O ' War , often called the greatest living race-horse.
