Last March , by act of God and the frailty of human works , 350 persons were killed when the St. Francis dam in Ventura county , Calif. , burst . Last week , the city of Los Angeles and the county of Ventura , basing the value of life upon the earning power of the dead , made settlements to heirs of between $11,000 and $20,000 per victim . Some heirs , dissatisfied , were suing for as high as $100,000 per adult victim , $35,000 per child victim . A firm of Stockton lawyers was asking one-third of these sums for handling the suits .
