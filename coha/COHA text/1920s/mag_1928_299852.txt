The Defense Committee of the U. S. Polo Association selected , last week , a team to meet the Argentines . J. Cheever Cowdin was given the position of back , the one which had been in doubt , the one which 22-year-old Winston Guest had hoped to get . <P> Thus , the line-up will be : <P> <P> United States Argentine <P> Harriman No. 1 Kenny <P> Hitchcock No. 2 Nelson <P> Stevenson No. 3 Miles <P> Cowdin Back Lacey <P> The date of the first match was postponed to Sept. 22 at the Meadow Brook Club , Westbury , Long Island . The reason for the change in date : the ponies of the Argentines have been increasingly coughing , suffering from influenza and laryngitis . So afflicted , ponies become weak , nervous , unpleasantly humored . But , late last week , the condition of the Argentine mounts was improved , and it seemed certain that Sept. 22 would see fast and proper polo . <P> And later still , last week , the U. S. polo team was unmercifully trounced in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hopping , " Laddie " Sanford . The score : 8 to 5 . The question : If the U.S. team was unable to stop Guest and Sanford , how will it contrive to stop brilliant Lewis Lacey of the Argentines ?
