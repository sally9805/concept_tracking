The crow of the fighting cock is Porto Rico 's national anthem , sung from early dawn to murmurous dusk by spur-legged game-birds tethered in squalid door-yards all over the island . On Sundays the national anthem is stilled . Those sacks you see the natives carrying along the white roads on Sunday morning contain the coxcomb choir . They are going to the cockpits , where a knife , a flask of bitter liquor , volleys of cheers and curses , the chink of coin , the spurt of dust and blood - not always fowl blood-spell life 's zest for the brown-skinned jibaro ( peasant ) . Porto Rican poets hymn the sport as the essence of manhood and beauty . <P> When laws are passed in the U. S. prohibiting Sunday golf , great is the outcry .

The jibaro pays no attention , saving his breath for the secret pit , the dashing fury of his little bird , the hot argument or epic narrative afterward.
