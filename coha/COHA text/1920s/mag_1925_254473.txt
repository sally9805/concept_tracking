In the picturesque little town of Heemstede , near Haarlem , was opened the annual and historic flower show , where more than three million plants scented the air with their delicate fragrance and delighted the eye with their galaxy of color . <P> Six exhibitions are to be held during the life of the show , which is to end on May 21 . Horticulturists from many parts of the world were expected . Financially , the show was an assured success from the outset , the organizers having informed the Government that they would not call upon the 50,000 florins voted to cover a possible deficit .
