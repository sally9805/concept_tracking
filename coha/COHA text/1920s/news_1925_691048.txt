txt Talk of a legislative canvass of the State pardon and parole records was crystallizing among Kansas legislators tonight as they gathered here for the opening of the 1925 Legislature next Tuesday , following charges of the alleged payment of $1,250 to Russell Davis , son of Governor Jonathan AL Davis , for the delivery of a pardon to Fred W. Pollman , former banker , convicted of forgery . There came also reports of other alleged irregularities . At least half a dozen hccusations have come to the Attorney General 's office within two weeks , said Attorney General C. B. Griffith today . None has been thoroughly investigated and nothing to warrant charges has been revealed , but an inquiry has been quietly under way by his department . Governor Davis issued a statement to the people of TrOTIC .. reiterating his avowal of his own innocence , and attributing to his son 's " unsophisticated nature " his falling ' into " indiscreet acts . " Russell Davis 's entrapmcat In a Topeka.hotel yesterday led- to -- the exposure . The Governor does hot deny that KS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pollman , paroled forger , and former President of the Linn County Bank at La Cygne . But he professes innocence of any knowledge of the proceedings . Talk of Legislative Inquiry . Interest centred tonight in the expected arrival of State Senator James W. Finley of Chanute , Chairman of the investigating committee in which the 1923 session vested authority to look into any and all State departments and to report its findings to the 1925 session . Whether the committee will undertake an investigation on short notice , it is believed . rested with Senator Finley . Otherwise an investigation by the new Legislature would be the course . Governor-elect Ben S. Paulen would not commit himself in regard to any action by the Legislature . " I believe , " he said , " that if the things written in the papers are true  --  and I have n't had time to read them all  --  an investigation of some sort is necessary ; and if they are not true , then certainly Governcfr Davis must want an investigation to clear his San 's name . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Attorney General Griffith suggested a bi-partisan legislative committee as the most effective and just method of baring the facts . Kansas has no Grand Jury , but the Legislature , he pointed out , could pursue a State-wide inquiry . Governor Davis said he was wholly unaware of any : payment of $4,000 by Mrs. W. A. Niacin in obtaining a pardon for her husband this week . Nixon had been serving a life term for the murder of A. J. Banta. a Great Bend attorney . According to a story published in Wichita , Mrs. Nixon had sold her home to R C. Gates . Democratic State Senator from Stafford County . for $4,000 , and had used the money to obtain Nixon 's pardon . . " I do n't know what it cost Mrs. Nixon , " the Governor said . " It must have been a large sum , however , as she employed a high priced attorney . " Sam Amidon , Wichita attorney and Democratic National Committeeman for Kansas , represented Mrs. Nixon in the hearings before Governor Davis . Judge S. S. Irwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have expired April 1 , this year , thus restoring him to full citizenship , The Governor 's friends pointed to this fact In support *of their theory that the $1.250 paid by Pollman to Russell Davis was furnished by some other source to " frame " the Governor politically . Pollman himself , they said , would not have given the amount to obtain a pardon when he had been at liberty two years and would be entirely free in a few weeks . Governor Davis 's Statement . Governor Davis 's statement read as follows : regard to the- published statements regarding.tha pardon Issued to ' Fred W. : Pollman , I want to say first that I knew nothing whatever of Mr. Pollman 's visit to my son at the farm or his negotiations with my son until 6:30-o'clock yesterday evening . " I had known Poliman , not intimately ' . but in a general way by reputation and by acquaintance for several years  --  some four or five  --  before his bank failed at La Cygne , Kan . " I had been called as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been familiar more or less with the facts , brought out at the triaL I had felt that under the cir ? cumstanees of the failure and no one having suffered any loss that there had been no need of prosecuting Pollman . Accordingly . when his attorney , John Crane . asked me to write a. letter to Governor Allen recommending his parole , I had done so in October , 1922 . Governor Allen had paroled him in January , 1923 . Governor Gate Pardon to Son . had met and talked with Pollman itieveral times and he afterward applied for and I gave him a conditional discharge . " lie had talked with me in regard to a pardon , telling me of some coal interests in Illinois that he wanted to develop , that he would be hampered in the development until he was restored to full citizenship , but at no time had I ever talked with him regarding a money consideration or any other sort of consideration in respect to what I might or might not do for him . I never referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon , neither did I ever send any one to him or tell any one to convey any message to him regarding his pardon . " His case was to have come up for hearing on Dec. 27 . He wrote Me and said he would not be here on that day . and I wrote him that the hearing could be held any day that he could come to my office while I was still in office . " When my son asked me what I was going to do in the case of Pollman I told him that I thought , pe.1-:q.zis , I would pardon him , so when he cazrea yesterday and told me that Pollman was in town and would like to have his pardon issued , it occasioned no more than passing notice . I told him that Mr. Pollman ought to come up here and get it , and he said that he wanted to avoid the publicity as much as possible , and as Pollman had said that to me frequently , I did not think anything particular of it and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel to him . This was some time about 2 or 2:30. as near as I remember it , in the afternoon . " I did not see the boy any more until something near 6:30 in the afternoon . He had not said anything to me at any time about Mr. Pollman employing him or giving him or offering him any money . At 6:30 he told me what had happened at the hotel . Contradicts Pollman. - " The statements regarding Glen Davis ift.re untrue where they say that I talked to Glen Davis about a money consideration for his parole and commutation or in respect to a pardon for Pollman . Pollman had first called my attention to Glen Davis as an inmate of the penitentiary and had taken quite an interest in him , and mentioned him frequently to me . The Board of Administration had also been attracted to Davis by his outstanding work in the institution . " Davis had been about my office in and out for several days about the time I issued his parole and commutation . The Board of Administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon , but I did not think his case warranted that action and so had given him a parole with commutation to twenty years . He was dissatisfied , apparently , with this ; at least , he stayed about a day to two trying to persuade me to give him more of a cut . " This I want to reiterate , that I consider Glen Davis 's parole and commutation on the merits of the case and gave him what I thought the record indicated he should have without any thought at any time of any money consideration , and that I considered Pollman 's case on its merits and the information I had regarding it . without any knowledge or thought or consideration of a monetary nature , so that while some of the statements In the story are true . they have been able to build up enough falsehoods and by taking advantage of my friendship for Pollman and Davis and of the unsophisticated nature of my son , to inveigle him into some indiscreet acts . I am sure he did not realize the gravity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved from the humiliation . " I have held these parole hearings at all times with an open door , and at no time and in no case have I been influenced by the payment of any money . " I am sure a full and complete investigation of all the records and files in the parole cases I have gone over will show just basis for the decision reached in each case . " How Young Davis was Trapped . Young Davis accepted $1,000 from Pollman while two newspaper representatives , a shorthand reporter and other witnesses In an adjoining room listened to theIr conversation by the aid of a telephonic device hidden behind a curtain in Pollman 's room , according to The Kansas City Journal . Receiving the $1,000 payment , the Governor 's son left the hotel and ' returned with the pardon and then received $250 more , said the newspaper 's story . He then was confronted by reporters and witnesses with them , and , threatened with arrest . returned the $250 , left ' the hotel and returned with the $1,000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they said . Pollman read a statement to young Davis , saying : " Now this is what I am going to say to you . I have written it out on paper , so I would n't forget it : Russell . I am , indeed , sorry your father , the Governor . has exacted this money from me . I have considered all along that he could re-. lease me on the merits and the ? facts in my case and that he was my friend . Evidently what he is doing in my case has been going on for some time . Your father knows I am not a thief , or a crook . ? * * It was only when he requested that I employ you that I considered it the opportune time to do what I am now doing . My friends in the adjoining room have heard every word and have known every move . From now on you can talk to them . " Pullman. in an affidavit , stated young Davis arranged the meeting at the hotel at a conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had visited young Davis at the Davis farm near Bronson , Kan .. where the latter discussed the payment of money for a pardon . Pollman also alleged he had been told by Glenn A. Davis , who was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder , that Governor Davis solicited the payment of money to his son for Executive clemency . In his first statement since yesterday Russell Davis late today declared his father had known nothing- of his acceptance of money from Pollman . He said : " In regard to the Pollman pardon . I have no statement to make other than my father knew nothing about my conversation that I had with Pollman down on our farm in Kansas City or in the National Hotel yesterday until I told him about it at 6.30 o'clock Friday afterno - On ass tans my mothers jeccouptI regret being so foolish as to be led into such a trap as was set for me .
