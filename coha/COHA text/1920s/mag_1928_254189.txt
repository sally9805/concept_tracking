Stethoscope scientists swarmed to Portland , Ore. , last week to attend the annual meeting of the National Tuberculosis Association . Dr. H. Longstreet Taylor of St. Paul in his presidential address emphasized the need for careful supervision of " cured " patients . This is an economic as well as a sociologic need since a large proportion of pulmonary patients are public charges and every relapse doubles the original cost of care . The " cure to end the cure " costs comparatively little and has far reaching benevolent effects , according to figures of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co . <P> Surgery has yielded " brilliant " results in pulmonary tuberculosis according to Dr. William H. Thearle of Denver . Thoracoplasty , an operation which consists in cutting away part of the ribs , allowing the diseased lung to collapse and be at rest , giving it a chance to heal , and stopping the spread of the disease , has been employed in 148 cases during the last seven years . Forty one per cent were cured , 33% improved .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
