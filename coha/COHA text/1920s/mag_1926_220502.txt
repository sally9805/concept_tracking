Intrepid Ingenue <P> The customs men had gone through her boxes quickly and she was free to leave . Most of the other passengers from the Majestic still sat about , perched on trunks or , wearily , on baggage carts , in the salt-smelling cavern of the pier . She moved away , accompanied by a handsome woman of 45 , whose maternal caveat alone discouraged the imminent addresses of a young man in a Panama , who had been staring for fifteen minutes with a sort of scholarly zeal , as if , he seemed to say , her face reminded him of someone . As she passed through the ticket lines he turned again , pointed his finger , suddenly and rudely exclaimed : " Helen Wills ! " <P> Her expression-the " Little Poker Face " of a thousand newspaper stories-sustained no change . Yet surely she heard . And surely she was pleased . For the Panama 's cry was the one important recognition accorded her on her return to the U. S. last week . <P> There might have been speeches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police band playing Sousa 's march and the Mayor standing in the bow waving the Keys of the City . There might have been all these delights and many more if , one hot day last February on the Riviera , she had drunk a glass of brandy when Mlle. Lenglen drank one , and if an attack of appendicitis had not forced her to occupy the Royal Box instead of Court No. 1 at the recent festivities at Wimbledon . For the exclamation of the Panama really punctuated a cycle . <P> That cycle began in 1905 when a female child was born to Dr. and Mrs. C. A. Wills in Centreville , Alameda County , Calif . Sleep- simple food-outdoor exercise-her father had used the phrases before . He used them on his patients , and pretty soon he was able to move to Berkeley and send Helen east to school at Hopkins Hall ( near Bennington , Vt . ) . She was still very small when the War started , and one year she came home for the summer holidays to find the house strangely empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , he came back , she had grown out of all recognition . A friend of the family 's , William C. ( " Pop " ) Fuller , had had a hand in promoting this growth . Knowing how things were apt to be with the doctor away and all , he got into the way of dropping over every afternoon and taking Helen down to the Berkeley Tennis Club . " Pop " would spread his silk handerchief on the service line , give Helen four dozen balls and let her shoot at it .
