Officially Lenin is reported to be progressing favorably . Unofficially it is rumored that he has been dead for some weeks . As no one can see the Premier of the Russian Soviet Government , dead or alive , and as the press censorship is so severe that there is no possibility of a leak through official channels , the world will have to wait the pleasure of the parsimonious Bolsheviki . <P> In the interim between fact and probability speculation is still rife as to who will succeed Lenin . The latest theory is that when his death is announced the whole fabric and government of the Russian Communists will collapse . There is not one iota of truth in this contention , for during the past few months Lenin has ceased to be of any political consequence . Kaminev , weak and moderate , has been installed in the shoes of the great one ; but these shoes are so big and strong that Kaminev has to go where they take him . The men who are really ruling Russia ( Rykov , Zinovien , Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear Lenin and have directed their policies through such figureheads as Kaminev , Tchitcherin and Kalinin.
