IT IS much the present fashion to talk of love as though it were a recent development , brought up from inefficiency and put into large-scale production by modern methods , yet the romance of Charles Stewart Parnell and Katherine O'Shea ? running its course in the very heart of the Victorian era ? had a flame that makes even the most ardent imagining of screen , theater and best seller appear colorless , casual and inhibited . To this day the great Irish leader remains an enigma , confusing in his contradictions , bewildering in his paradoxy . He was an aristocrat and a landlord , bound to the empire by birth , tradition and economic interest , yet even the peasants of Connaught were not more savage in their hatred of England and the English ; a Protestant without a drop of Irish blood in his veins , he ruled Catholic Ireland as its uncrowned king ; cold , aloof , imperious , lacking every art of popular appeal , not Grattan nor O'Connell was more the idol of the emotional Gaels . In nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love , for this man of ice and iron , seeming to live only for hates and ambitions , fed his life into the fire of passion with all the abandonment of an Antony . Katherine O'Shea was the wife of a former captain of Hussars , an irresponsible Irish dandy whose extravagances had made him dependent upon the generosity of rich relatives . The lives of the two had drifted apart , and she and her children were established on the estate of an aged aunt at Eltham ; but when " Willie " was elected to Parliament from County Clare in 1880 , Mrs. O'Shea went to London to grace the series of introductory dinners that he planned . It had been hoped that Parnell would be the guest of honor , but always his chair remained vacant , a subject of chaffing comment . " You will never get him , dear lady , " prophesied Justin McCarthy . " He goes nowhere . " Others joined in with tales of the Irish leader 's inaccessibility and invincible distaste for social intercourse . Mysterious disappearances were his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open a letter , and such was his dislike of even ordinary - contacts that political associates were not allowed to address him without permission . As for women , they played no part in a life that had ever been remote and ascetic .  | " Why , the man 's a challenge ! " cried Mrs. O'Shea with an irritated laugh . " I 'll accept if only to v indicate my sex . Who wants to wager the Uncrowned King of Ireland will not be sitting in that chair at my next dinner ? " Half imperiously , half curiously , she drove to the house of Commons through the watery sunlight of a London summer , and sent in her card to Parnell . Ile came out into the palace yard , a tall , gaunt man , white and still as a sunbleached bone but for his burning eyes , furnishing an almost painful contrast to Mrs. O'Shea 's own vivid coloring and radiant vitality . It was a meeting as fatal as that of Samson with Delilah or Abelard with Heloise , a passion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his roof top and thrilled to the naked loveliness of Bathsheba . No word was spoken , for none was needed . As people in a dream , they drew close , locked hands and took the path of tragedy . Parnell was thirty-four at the time and had never known love ; Katherine O'Shea was thirty , a blameless wife and devoted mother , yet the two pledged their troth and wedded in a look . A rose fell from her bodice and , picking it up , he touched the blossom lightly with his lips . Years afterward she found the faded flower among his private papers , and placed it on his heart as he lay in his coffin . For a while there were only long afternoons when they drove far into the country , but soon Parnell was a frequent guest at Eltham . " Willie " himself urged the visits , seeing nothing but that larger intimacy with the party leader might mean much to his political advancement , but Mrs. O'Shea saw clearly . Repeatedly , desperately , she struggled to win free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's career , but pleadings were powerless against his calm fatalism . " For good or ill , " he said , " I am your husband , your lover , your children , your all . I will give my life to Ireland , but to you I give my love , whether it be your heaven or your hell . It is destiny . When I first looked into your eyes I knew . " Divorce was not possible , owing to the English law that gave a wife no cause for action unless the husband beat her before a multitude or committed his adulteries in a public square , but this caused Parnell no concern at all . His was the simple conviction that there was no marriage when love ceased to exist , and from the moment he took Katherine O'Shea in his arms he felt her to be as much his wife as though the union had been blessed by bell , book and ring . Out of this same reasoning he experienced no embarrassment in meeting the husband , regarding him merely as a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to value and cherish . But for the entreaties of Mrs. O'Shea , fearful of the political results , there is little doubt that Parnell would have proclaimed his Love to " Willie " and the world . As it was , he made small attempt at concealment . A few months after their first meeting it became necessary for him to disappear from London for a space , and packing a bag lie went down to Eltham and calmly installed himself in Mrs. O'Shea 's dressing-room . There he lived happily for two whole weeks , and while she cooked special dishes at the open fire he poured out his dreams of a free Ireland , or else told in a low , intense monotone of Irish horrors he had seen ? starving children , old women frozen stiff on the bleak hillsides , mothers thrown from their beds while undergoing the agonies of travail ? all things that explained his hate of England . From this time on Eltham became his home , a haven in which the sick , worn man hurried for shelter from political storms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Willie , " and behind the high walls Parnell knew the excited interests of a belated boyhood . Days were given to assaying small pieces of quartz brought from the streams of Wicklow , then astronomy became a hobby , and when the stars lost interest there was absorbed study of architecture and bookkeeping . Life for the lovers was as quiet , normal and ordered as though no sword of exposure hung over their heads . He was her king , she was his queen , and their dream became the great reality . The villagers talked , as a matter of course ; the gossip spread , and Captain O'Shea , suddenly deciding that his property rights were in danger , raced down to Eltham and threw Parnell 's belongings out of the house with much noise and many gestures . Instead of guilty panic , how ever , Parnell felt all the outrage of a husband whose home had been invaded , and the tremendous simplicity of the man , as well as his deadly humorlessness , is adequately set forth in these notes : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote to Katherine . " I inquired at both parcel-room and cloakroom , and this hotel at Charing Cross today , and they were not to be found . " And again : " He Captain O'Shea has written me a very insulting letter , and I shall be obliged to send a friend to him if I do not have a satisfactory reply to a second note I have just sent him . " O'Shea , however , was the one that challenged , The O'Gorman Mahon carrying his cartel , and Parnell accepted  | at once , gloomily eager to avenge the " insult . " " Willie , " however , whether cowed by this imperious front or else appreciating the hurt to his political ambitions likely a combination of both ? did not insist upon the meeting . As a result of the formal parleys the lover loftily agreed to quit making his home at Eltham , and the husband accepted this grudging concession as full satisfaction . They were not small stakes that the Irish leader hazarded on his passion , for Parnell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without parallel for sheer meteoric brilliance . When he entered Parliament in 1875 few knew him outside of his county , yet within two years he had made himself the master of his party . Contemptuously repudiating the amiable policies of Isaac Butt , who felt that pacific presentation of Ireland 's case would compel English justice , Parnell turned Westminster into a bedlam by his savage obstructions . Constructing no less boldly in Ireland , he put himself behind Davitt 's Land League until the island seethed with revolt ; even the sullen , violent Fenians were won to his support , and a triumphal tour of the United States gained the devotion of the Irish revolutionary societies in America . In 1880 , a few months before his meeting with Katherine O'Shea , he had joined forces with Gladstone for the overthrow of Disraeli , and thus , in five years , stood where he had planned to stand ? the balance of power between Liberals and Conservatives , Home Rule the price of his favor . Cautious Gladstone , however , took no steps to remedy the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evictions continued to multiply , filling the roads with a sad stream of homeless , starving men , women and children . At first Parnell preached open rebellion , carrying the burning arrow from Donegal to Cork , but , soon appreciating the futility of armed resistance , his fertile mind evolved the boycott . Speaking at Ennis , he gave this order to his people : " When a man takes a farm from which another has been unjustly evicted , you must shun him on the roadside ; you must shun him in the shop ; you must shun him on the fair green and in the market place , and even in the place of worship ; isolate him as if he were a leper of old . " He was arrested on a charge of " conspiracy to impoverish landlords , " and when the trials proved farcical Gladstone introduced a Coercion Bill more cruel than any that had gone before . Parnell 's vain fight against its passage brought him to the grave 's edge , and even after its adoption he gave himself no rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing the people with his own hate and violence . Gladstone , persuaded by " Buckshot " Forster , finally ordered his arrest , and in October , 1881 , the " Uncrowned King " was lodged in Kilmainham jail . Small wonder that the prisoner entered his cell with death in his white face and tormented eyes . It was not only that he knew physical exhaustion ; there was also the secret fact that Katherine O'Shea was then carrying his child . Now indeed were the lovers called upon to pay for their stolen happiness with heart 's blood and agony of soul . Daily letters , smuggled out of Kilmainham , implored his " dearest wife " to guard her health , urged her to see doctors , begged her to go to the seashore and cried his love and anguish in every line . Nor was separation at such a time the only torture . " Willie , " without doubt , must have forced a resumption of domestic relations after the duel incident , for he saw his wife 's condition with great satisfaction , evidencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he decided to grow solicitous , and visited Eltham with irritating frequency , pattering and chatting about the home as though his married life had never known a break . All were gross impertinences that ground Parnell 's pride to powder . Fury and despair consumed him that he could not rush to Eltham and throw the insufferable creature out of the house ; that he could not take " Willie " by the throat and say , " Damn you , the child is mine ! " As for the poor , harassed mother , sick with hatred of her husband and convulsed by anxiety for Parnell , what wonder that she bore a baby that never had a chance to live ? The birth took place in February , but it was not until April that Parnell managed to secure a parole and hurried to Eltham that he might see his daughter and comfort the distracted mother with the warmth of his arms . Again the  | lovers paid , for Captain O'Shea was still on the ground , bustling and officious , and for long hours the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loathing in his eyes . Only at daybreak , when the house fell quiet , was he able to slip up to the dark bedroom where his loved ones lay , and even as he embraced them , kisses salt with tears , the little one breathed its last . Surely that awful moment , so packed with horror , should have discharged their debt to outraged morality ! With lips locked by their guilty secret they could not cry out as the tiny body grew cold beneath their hands ? could not give anguish the relief of sobs and tears . Never had she needed him more to hold her close , but as long as he was in the room she could not call for lights and aid . Only when he had crept down the stairs , this staggering , stumbling thing that men called the Uncrowned King , did the half-mad mother dare to wake the house with her screams . Back to Ireland the stricken man dragged himself , the terms of his parole not permitting him to stay and see the dead child laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bitter and brooding , who should appear but O'Shea ? As a reason for visiting Eltham , Parnell had been compelled to invent the excuse that he needed " Willie 's " help in negotiations with the Government , and the debonair captain had come to press for fulfillment of the plans that meant his prominence . England 's policy of " blood and iron " had failed signally , as always , for murder and arson were Ireland 's answer to the Coercion Act and Parnell 's arrest , and some weeks before Gladstone had intimated that he would welcome a settlement . Using the delighted captain as a go-between , Parnell proceeded to dictate the terms of the " Kilmainham Treaty , " by which Gladstone agreed to release the - Irish prisoners in return for vague promises of peace and order . It was a tremendous victory for Parnell , and so received by England as well as Ireland , but even as he carried his triumph to Eltham , and planned to take quick advantage of Gladstone 's irresolution , there came news that struck hint down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Irish office by reason of their friendly disposition ? were assassinated by unknown ruffians , stabbed to death in broad daylight in Phoenix Park . Worn by imprisonment and private grief , Parnell 's habitual impassiveness went to pieces , for he saw clearly that the murders meant the loss of all that had been gained . Beside himself with rage and wretchedness , he vowed to retire from public life , but Mr. Gladstone joined with the Irish party in pointing out the suicidal nature of such a course , and when Mrs. O'Shea supported their protest Parnell surrendered . Even so , a sense of futility paralyzed him , and he sat sick and silent while the Government soothed popular clamor by the passage of a new Crimes Act . The menace of bankruptcy now came to intensify the blackness of the clouds that enveloped the unhappy leader , for as a result of his devotion to the Cause he had lost an annual income of $20,000 , and Avondale , his home , was so heavily mortgaged as to be threatened with foreclosure . No sooner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people rushed to the aid of their adored leader , and not even a papal rescript , sternly forbidding the faithful to take part in the testimonial , had power to check the country 's generous enthusiasm . " Make Peter 's pence into Parnell 's pounds " became the cry that rang through every parish , and when the subscription books were closed it was found that ? 39,000 had been raised instead of the . ? 20,000 asked . This proof of love was as a draught of wine to the tired , despairing man , and again he flamed with all his former energy and genius for leadership . Since the Liberal alliance had proved fruitless , he would try the Tories . Back and forth he bargained with Lord Salisbury , Lord Randolph Churchill and ambitious young " Joe " Chamberlain , and in June of 188 the Irish members joined votes with the Tories for the overthrow of the Gladstone ministry . Once more he sat in the seat of power , the master of English politics , for when Lord Salisbury took office the beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You are only Parnell 's lieutenant . " Another great victory , but such satisfaction as Parnell may have felt was destroyed by distressing complications in connection with " Willie " O'Shea . Although born of an old Limerick family , Irish for centuries , the captain prided himself in being more English than the English , and was ever at pains to show contempt for his own people . Throughout his five years in the House the supercilious dandy had refused to sit with the Irish members , continually sneering at their uncouthness and even going so far as to mimic openly their mannerisms and brogue.  | Naturally enough , all hated him , and when he sought reelection the whole of Clare rose against him in an ecstasy of rejection . No whit perturbed , " Willie " turned to Parnell and arrogantly demanded some other Irish seat . In the same breath , however , he refused to give any pledge of party loyalty , whereupon Parnell declared that such an attitude precluded further discussion . Mrs. O'Shea went white when told of the interview . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not only that political interests and activities kept him away from Eltham ; there was also the fear of what he might do if enraged . Cruel indeed was the dilemma of the lovers , for on one side were " English hypocrites " and on the other " Irish fanatics . " To let " Willie 's " demands go unheeded meant his enmity , while to force his election by an Irish constituency would be accepted as evidence of a secret , shameful bargain . Badgered , Parnell finally succeeded in getting his Liverpool people to stand for the captain 's candidacy , but he was beaten by a narrow margin , and once again , through Mrs. O'Shea , he presented his demand for an Irish seat . It was owing to him , he claimed , by reason of his part in the Kilmainham Treaty . Why , Parnell had given him " a solemn promise . " Yet all the while he talked of his services the lovers felt the threat behind his words . Only Galway was available , that Galway where Parnellism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can do it , " Parnell admitted , " but it will be such a shock to my people that they 'll never feel the same . Queenie , you must see him again and say that I will propose him if he 'll consent to take the party pledge . Anything less is an insult . " There was that in the back of " Willie " O'Shea 's mind , however , that made him refuse . Perhaps his own curdled heart found joy in forcing Parnell 's humiliation , or it may have been that his assertion of independence was no more than a poor effort to recapture his self-respect . " Very well , " said Parnell when he received the ultimatum , " I 'll run him for Galway if I have to jam him down their throats . It will cost me the confidence of the party , but that much he shall have , and I shall be done with his talk of pledges . " And done it was with the exact result that Parnell had prophesied ! Every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew that he had been betrayed at the behest of Mrs. O'Shea , and , although not one dared to voice a protest , the seeds of revolt were sown . The Irish alliance with the Tories was short-lived , due largely to Parnell 's imperiousness . Friendly officials were appointed to govern Ireland , and at every point Lord Salisbury made conciliation a fixed policy , but this was not enough for the Uncrowned King . Always impatient and dictatorial , the trouble with " Willie " had not soothed his ragged nerves and out of a clear sky he made sudden declaration that " national independence " was henceforth Ireland 's one demand . The English press thundered denunciations of his " impudence , " and Lord Salisbury , taking fright , refused to consider any such " insanity . " From the first , Parnell had been firmly of the opinion that Gladstone was the one English statesman with sufficient courage to handle the Irish problem justly , and now he initiated new discussions with the Grand Old Man . As neither cared to have it known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the official gobetween . Cleverly , persistently , Parnell deluged Gladstone with the facts of Ireland 's case , and slowly but surely the aged statesman came to the belief that some form of Home Rule was right and necessary . Week after week Mrs. O'Shea went back and forth , and at last the secret deal was concluded ; on February 1 , 1886 , Parnell voted with the Liberals to unseat Salisbury , and for the third time Gladstone became premier . On April 8th he kept his promise , introducing a Home Rule Bill over the protests of party leaders and the resignation of various members of his cabinet . Moreover , he fought for its adoption with a passionate vigor that belied his seventy-seven years , but when he went down to defeat by a vote of 343 to 313 , an alarmed and outraged England returned the Tories to power . Never strong , overwork and bitter disappointment now brought Parnell to a condition bordering on nervous collapse , and Mrs. O'Shea made him leave his dreary hotel for a small but comfortable house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , for along in the early morning hours she heard the beat of hoofs under her window and looked out to see her lover . " I could not bear the loneliness of it , " he explained , and then announced that he meant to stay at Eltham . The decision was most unwise , for the new living arrangement became an open scandal , in London as well as the village . and Captain O'Shea took advantage of the gossip to express a sense of outrage . Wear Parnell waved him away contemptuously. and Katherine , catching her lover 's disdain , met the outburst with the sharp retort that " the only person who ever tarnished your honor has been yourself . " There were other ' annoyances occasioned by the curious , but Parnell had the gift of being able to raise himself above selfconsciousness , and the country quiet restored his health in some degree . The defeat of the Home Rule Bill , however , stirred Ireland into new outbursts of revengeful fury , and the Tory government retaliated by a drastic Crimes Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the publication of a series entitled " Parnellism and Crime , " and one article contained a letter , purported to be signed by Parnell , that virtually approved the Phoenix Park assassinations . He read the paper at the breakfast table and then , entirely disinterested , turned eagerly to his crucibles and blowpipes , for Irish gold happened to be his hobby at the moment . Mrs. O'Shea sought vainly to make him appreciate the importance of meeting the charge , but he only answered abstractedly that the Times was " a paper of no particular importance after all . " The party finally induced him to brand the letter as a forgery , and then he lapsed once more into indifference . The Times and political enemies persisted in the charges . however , and the Government , secure in the conviction of Parnell 's guilt . appointed a commission to conduct a formal inquiry . Every phase of Irish revolt was scrutinized , but , while some of the findings were damaging , the case against Parnell broke down entirely . The famous letter turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Pigott , and after full confession the poor wretch killed himself to avoid arrest . The event of chief importance to the lovers , however , was Captain O'Shea 's declaration of enmity . for he went out of his way to take the stand and swear to his belief in the genuineness of the signature . As if glad to put away dissimulation , Parnell let his eyes fill with the suppressed hatred of years , and " Willie , " unable to meet that terrible glare , slunk from the room . At the trial 's end , with its triumphant vindication , there was a moment when England laid aside her hatred for the Irish leader , filling the air with cheers , Gladstone and the  | Liberals leading in a hubbub of lionization . Parnell 's presence was begged in the homes of the great , and crowds acclaimed him , but while Mrs. O'Shea reveled in the applause her lover merely remarked : " They would all be at my throat in a week if they could . Do n't you see , Queenie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thought I had written those letters , and now they are extolling their own sense of justice in cheering me because I did not write them . 1 might as wisely shout myself hoarse if a court of law decided that Gladstone had not told somebody to rob a bank . " Do n't he too pleased with the clapping of these law lovers , Queenie . I have a presentiment that you will hear them another way before long . " It was a true presentiment , for , as though he had waited until Parnell should have mounted highest , " Willie " O'Shea brought suit for divorce . Whatever the reason for his belate surrender of complacence whether Tory influence c his own revolt against Parnell 's icy contempt he refused to listen even to the implorations of Cardinal Manning , and brought suit with his wife 's adultery a a cause of action . Mrs. O'Shea , broken and hysterical , begged piteously that a fight be made , but Parnell shook his head . " No , Queenie , what 's the use ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall always come where you are We have been longing for this freedom all these years , and now you are afraid . I have given , and will give , Ireland what is in me to give . That I have vowed to her , but my private life shall never belong to any country , but to one woman . There will be a howl , but it will be the howling of hypocrites ; not altogether , for some of these Irish fools are genuine in their belief that forms and creeds can govern life and men ; perhaps they are right so far as they can experience life . But I am not as they , for they are among the world 's children . " I am a man , and I have told these children what they want . But if they turn from me , my queen , it matters not at all in the end . What the ultimate government of Ireland will be is settled , and it will be so ; and what my share in the work has been and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stop fretting about me . We know nothing of how or why , but only that we love one another , and that through all the ages is the one fact that can not be forgotten nor put aside by us . " " But I have hurt your work , " she sobbed , clinging to him and refusing to be comforted . " No , you have not , " he replied . " I sometimes think that is why you came to me , for I was very ill then , and you kept the life in me and the will to go on when 1 was very weary of it all ; you have stood to me for comfort and strength and my very life . I have never been able to feel in the least sorry for having come into your life . It had to be , and the bad times I have caused you and the stones that have been flung at you are all no matter , because to us there is no one else in the world that matters at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1890 , and at first the Irish party decided to stand by Parnell , for all Ireland had known of his affair with Mrs. O'Shea , just as Gladstone and all England had known . No sooner , however , had he been reelected to leadership than Gladstone served notice that the Liberal party could not continue to stand for Home Rule unless Parnell were deposed . Again the Irish members met , and while some were honest in their support of Gladstone 's position , others took occasion to vent the smoldering hates and resentments bred by Parnell 's years of autocratic rule . He is the master of the party , " cried loyal John Redmond , leading the fight against Gladstone 's ultimatum . " And how about the mistress of the party ? " hissed Timothy Healy , a man that Parnell had lifted from some petty clerkship to prominence and power . It did not serve to brand Healy as a " contemptible little scoundrel " or to stare contemptuously while other men that he had made spat out their venom . At the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving only twentysix with Redmond . Neither the Irish members nor the crowds that followed him to his train , some vulgarly curious , others noisily insulting , were privileged to see a break in Parnell 's air of chill disdain , but with Mrs. O'Shea 's arms about him that night he confessed defeat . " The Grand Old Spider , " he said wearily , " has nearly all of my flies in his web . " Strangely enough , he felt no resentment against Gladstone , dissenting when Mrs. O'Shea attacked the aged statesman for his hypocrisy , pointing out that he had known of their relations for ten long years , and accepting them without demur when she served as an official go-between . " You fail to make allowance for the necessities of statecraft , " said Parnell . " He has the Non-Conformist conscience to consider . But these fools who throw me over at his bidding make me a little sad . " Rest and quiet were still his needs , but , putting aside illness and exhaustion , Par- nell crossed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if he had transgressed against the moral code ? That was between hint and his God . All that concerned Ireland was his public conduct . Would any man dare say that he had ever been false to his people and the Irish cause ? Lp and down the length and breadth of the land he dragged himself , an ambulatory corpse save for his burning eyes , driven forward only by his indomitable will . Never did man make a braver fight , but it was hopeless from the first . The Irish people loved him in their hearts , but the Church thundered its anathemas from every pariah pulpit . Tim Healy screamed against " Parnell 's conicted English prostitute , " and other gutter minds built vile songs around the name of " Kitty " O'Shea . Rains drenchred him , damp cabins chilled him and the lime that cowards threw half blinded him , but till Parnell fought on . only to lose bitterly contested elections in Kilkenny , Sligo and Carlow . One happiness remained alone to the falling leader . On June 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steyning , starting before daylight , that the newspaper men might be eluded , and made her his wife . Even the light of a great pride , the glory of his , joy , however , could not give color to his pale cheeks or hide the mortal sickness in his sunken eyes . On her knees the bride begged him to quit the struggle that was killing him , but he smiled grim dissent . " No , " he answered gently , " I would rather die than give in now ? give in to the howling of the English mob . " From - Monday to Friday he kept his place in the House of Commons , facing his enemies with unlowered crest ; Saturdays and Sundays saw him in Ireland , driving through rain and storm from village to illage , pouring out the last of his strength in the battle against his foes . At Creggs , on September 7th , he mounted the platform against the orders of his physician , hut when they helped him on the boat for England he murmured , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ile reached the home in Brighton with : Ill the age of the world in his face ? this Irian of forty-five ? and for a week his wife le Id him hack from the grave by the sheer three of her love . Inflammatory rheumatism kept him in agony , but her least ministration never failed to bring a smile of happiness , and when suffering permitted he talked of a " sunny land " to which they would go as soon as he had won his fight for Ireland . Day by day , however , he grew weaker , and on October 6th the worn spirit slipped through her fiercely gripping fingers . They took the body to Dublin , fulfilling the dead man 's promise that he would return , and as the funeral procession moved through the pouring rain to somber Glasnevin a people knew all of their old love and loyalty , and it was the voice of Ireland that raised the ancient Gaelic ululu.  |                  @ @ @
