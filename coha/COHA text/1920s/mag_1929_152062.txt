As Congress met last week , Senator Arthur Capper of Kansas , his face stamped with anxiety , visited the White House . To President Hoover he stated his problem : Kansas granaries bulged with 40,000,000 bushels of 1928 surplus wheat held for export . It hung over the incoming crop , an imminent incubus . It could not be moved to seaboard with a transportation loss to the producers of 8 per bushel-a freight rate advantage enjoyed by Canada and Argentina on the wheat for the world market . Said Senator Capper : " This wheat must be moved in the next three months , as July wheat will then be coming into the market . Otherwise there would be no storage facilities . ... I have proposed to the Interstate Commerce Commission that they permit railroads to revise freight rates for 60 days so as to place the Kansas farmer on a parity with Canada and Argentina . . . . " Leaving the President 's office , issuing his statement to the press , posing for photographers , Senator Capper was not an impressive figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain world . Next day , the mild vagueness of President Hoover 's message to Congress on farm relief heightened the unrest . Wheat prices dropped 4 per bushel.
