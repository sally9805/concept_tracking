WHEN the submarine S-51 was rammed and sunk by the steamship City of Rome , off Block Island on the New England coast , one night last fall , the radio flash of the disaster reached , first of all , two sets of men . The life-savers -- the United States Coast Guard ? got it , of course , and at almost the same time the dio report was relayed by telephone to little group of men who sat , puffing Their pipes and swapping yarns , in the office of a New York wrecking company . This second group is like a fire depart-nt . Its office lights never are switched out ; its tugs never are caught with stone.d boilers , and its men literally sleep with one eye open and one ear cocked for news of a collision at night or a ship driven hard upon a lee shore . For these men are the salvors of the sea . We call em " wreckers , " but it is a isnomer , comparable almost calling life-savers " killers . " hough they deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with misfortune and the men aboard them . And when rescue is found impossible , they salvage . The news of the appalling fate that had befallen the S-51 and her crew electrified the little group in the wrecking company 's office into instant activity . Over a half-dozen telephones , calls immediately went out for Capt . Walter N. Davis , nearest wreckmaster to the scene of the crash . Captain Davis was close at hand that night , and was speeding for the New England coast almost before his informant had hung up . Had he been on his way home from a job off the coast of Maine , or aboard a steamer coming up from the Bahamas , that latitude of many wrecks , it would have been the same . The wreckmaster , no matter where he is , keeps in touch with headquarters , and ,  | when necessary , starts for his job ? as Captain Davis did that night ? in new hat and stiff collar ; for a wrecker 's working uniform is the clothes in which he stands when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piers in the Hudson River had been apprised of the disaster . Stokers began shaking up their banked fires for the quick getaway that often spells the difference between success and failure on their quest . Tugs prepared to start to sea on the bell . Huge , clumsy , floating derricks were cleared for their lumbering march to the scene of the wreck . Had the giant Monarch , mightiest of all derricks except those in the Canal Zone , been laid no for repairs , it would have made no difference . Spikes would have been driven into makeshift planking , even as she hauled away from her dock , or new hoisting cables rove off as she pounded along upon her course . THE Monarch was ready to go that night , so was her somewhat smaller sister the Century . Within a few hours they had started . While they were towed along , heaving-lines , hawsers , and purchase blocks were sorted and laid down ready for use . The latitude and longitude known , one glance at the chart told how much water covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tentative salvaging plans were laid on the basis of similar cases of the past . The S-51 was running upon her lawful occasions that night , on Long Island Sound . With no word of warning to officers or crew , without a moment 's time to close watertight doors and hatches , she was struck amidships , cut down , rolled over , and sunk in 20-odd fathoms ? 127 feet to be exact . It was an ill fate that caused the vessel to be struck near the center , her most vulnerable spot . Had the blow come forward or aft , the construction of the craft might have assured safety for her crew through closing the watertight doors . All happened , as things do at sea , so quickly that the two or three survivors of her crew of 34 men could not tell coherent stories , nor fully explain how they themselves escaped being dragged down with their ship . As diving goes today , 127 feet is no great depth of water . Plenty of divers have been down that far and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the profession , it is nothing . Air supply , whether it comes from the old-fashioned hand cranks , manned by husky shipmates , or from modern electric pumps , rarely fails ; diving suits are far better than they once were ; and up or down signals are much easier to send and receive through underwater telephones than by the old method of one jerk on the life line ? or two . What really matters is what the diver finds when he gets to the bottom . Of course , in this case , it was the trapped crew that must be thought of first . While there was still the chance of enough air being left in any compartment to keep men alive , everything was tried to save them . For hours on end the S-50 , sister ship of the sunken vessel , stood by , pumping air into her hull . Sometimes the first expedient is sweep .. ? dragging a heavy steel hawser over t ocean floor , as ships sweep for ener. mines or for a transatlantic cable . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister of the 51 , sank mysteriously off Honolulu , a few yea ago . Agraz , a navy gunner 's mate , riskes his life to go down some 280 feet . the attempt to locate the submarine direct the sweeping , or hook on slings could be used for raising those walled men , prison and all . IN THAT sad case , the sweeps actually did strike the ship , tug at her ? and slip off . Although one desperate attempt followed another through swift , baffling currents and in 300-foot depths , and although the hawser pounded and scraped the outer shell where any straining ear inside must have heard it , in the end there was nothing but failure . Only months afterward could pontoons bring up the F-4 . With the S-51 , it was decided to try lifting . Between them , the Monarch and the Century are good for many hundreds of tons , as any one knows who has seem them make no more of a battleship 's great guns than a bull elephant makes of  | a tree at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern derrick is almost unbelievable . It literally can duck off the side of a house , right an ov erturned locomotive , or bite off half a suspension bridge at one gulp . Clearly , it was up to the derricks . FOR lifting work , the first step is to get the slings passed . , Down goes the ever , armed with ' light line , tools , patterns , and , very probably , a highpressure water-hose . The light he gets may be daylight drifting down through green water , or it may be an electric lamp he carries with him . Perhaps the mud is soft around that buried keel ; so eke can push a batten through , with the tight line after it , and a heavier one to follow . Or he may have to dig long and hard , clearing away with his water hose goes . In one way or another , working always under the physical pressure of air and the mental pressure of the dire need for haste , he must dig under that keel , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sling to be hauled through . A submarine has relatively little beam , and the work may be much shorter than with a big ship ; but always there is that cry for speed , to give the crew its last lance .. Once passed , the slings can be worked a.ong until they are in the right position . Then , given smooth water , the hooking on the surface is not so difficult . " Heave away ? handsomely ! " Foot by foot , the slack of the cables come to the . drums on the hoisting engines , of which the Monarch has no less than three . Then , as gears and friction disks take hold and bite , the cables whine protestingly in their big sheaves , while engines dig their holding-down bolts into . e heavy deck-timbers and begin to " talk . " It is a terrific pull that these two derricks can exert , when they are " hooked down , " as salving men call it . The Monarch alone has done 300 tons in her time . With heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing , more and more , in spite of a hundred tons of water ballast to keep them on an even keel , until they ride at 30 degrees , with seas pouring over their inner rails and the heads of their great Aframes so close together that they can whisper pantingly to one another ? " Heave and hold ! " But up there at Block Island it was no use . Those two big fellows lifted for all that was in them , time after time , without moving the 51 a single inch . And the answer was that the hope of finding some air in the submarine was a false hope . No help came to the derricks from the lifting power of a tight compartment or two . There was no air , as the divers soon proved . To do that , they used the under-water cutting torch ? for all practical purposes , the same oxyacetylene affair that every one has seen puttering and spark ing away at a girder 90 or 100 feet above the street . With that torch , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvor , it was easy to cut a pencil hole in the sub 's shell and watch for the air bubbles that did not come . In fact , with this torch , whole sections of ships nowadays are cut off until the ships can be brought up in pieces . But on the 51 , the blowpipe cutting only proved that she must have been sent down with all her doors wide open and with not even a fighting chance for her crew . The Monarch and Century were beaten , and they turned for home , leaving it to their masters to work at some other scheme for raising . IN A sense , of course , such a job is all in a day 's work for the salvors . They have the gear , they have the experience , and they spend their lives in using both . Many of them are as offhand about it all as William Reid , when he remarked between dives : " It 's a fine day down below . " He makes a joke of his 100-foot jumps and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the divers rarely talk at all . But there are yarns of the salvors . Sometimes they can be had from such veterans as James McLeod ? Captain Mac , as all his world knows him through his 35 years as a wreckmaster and , lately , as a sort ' of consulting expert . If you catch him in his company 's office , you will find he treats it like a ship 's crosstrees , for his glance always is wandering out over the crowded harbor to watch the shipping , the wind , and the weather . " ' T is a good game , " he says , with his trace of burr that marks him for a Scot . " And we 'll always have men to play it , mind ye . For there must be wrecks as long as men go to sea , in spite o ' all your  | radio , your new fog-bearin 's , and other schemes to make navigatin ' easier . " A rigger 's job it is ? much of it ? for a man must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets from any set o ' tackles . Which is to say that there 's plenty of sailorizin ' in it . And the harder the job , I might say , the better we like it . Every wreck is a new problem . " THE divers have it better now than did when I started in the business . For one thing , we 've the decompression tank , that a man goes into when he comes up . This gives him pressure , same as he 's been getting on bottom , and then tapers off , bit by bit , ' till he comes to normal . Feed him a little helium , too , along with it ? the stuff that was in th ' poor Shenandoah ? for that eats up nitrogen and such-like gases that overload a man 's blood . ' T is so they keep off the bends ? somethin ' that hits the nerves like sciatica , only a whole lot worse . " There 's all sorts of divers . I had a Greek with me once who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if our gear was late comin ' or anyways out of order . They 're mostly Swedes and Norwegians nowadays ? fine , strong men ? but this Andy , which was as near as I got to his right name , was a good one . . His place isstill waitin ' where he left to go home for the last war , but it 's not likely he 'll ever be claimin ' it now . " I 'd another one who 'd go on th ' drinknow and again . That do n't do for most divers , but this one was strong ; he lasted a long time . He was down one mornin ' , and he did n't answer our signals . Thinks I , that 's the last o ' him . for I thought he 'd had a few the night before . After a bit o ' signalin ' , we sent down a second man , o ' course keepin ' up the pumpin ' for both . Well , there on deck , fathoms down , was our friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heads off and not bother him ? and him curled up comfortable , sleepin ' it off . ' T was one way of soldierin ' on a job , though some might not take to it ! " WEATHER ? Oh , ay , you get that , all right , and sometimes it holds you back , same as it did our men on this submarine . When the big derricks get rollin ' in a seaway , it 's about useless to try a liftin ' job . And for pontoons ? ye need smooth water for them . Some o ' the tanks are pretty big to get ' em filled with water and then sink ' em just so alongside a vessel 's hull or on top of her , accordin ' as she may be lyin ' . Next , you must make ' em fast where they 'll do their best liftin ' , and then blow ' em clear with air . That 's a job that ca n't be done with half a gale blowin ' and a sea runnin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handlin ' was the Emma Crowell , some years back . Loaded with case-oil , she was ; I forget how many thousand gallons . A brand new ship and hardly clear of New York Harbor before she caught fire , somehow .  | " Any fire at sea is bad enough , but oil= well , did you ever see one of those big shore-tanks go up ? A man on land can run over into th ' next county if things get too warm , but that 's somethin ' you ca n't do aboard ship ; anyhow , not while there 's half a chance left , for you 've little of anywhere to run to . " There was a fresh breeze goin ' , and the Crowell must have gone fast . Still , her crew managed to put up a good stiff fight , from what I heard , even with all hell roarin ' down her deck . At last it got too hot , so they grabbed up her papers and took to the boats ? and small wonder . " HER master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a valuable ship and the underwriters would n't believe it . They came down for us and our president says , ' Mac , ' says he , ' can we do anything ? ' " ' Well , ' says I , ' we can have a look , anyway . ' And out we went . " She was worth seein ' , when we got to her . Spars and riggin ' all gone , and fire still roarin ' hot . We shoved our boats over to her and went at her with steam hose . Two days of it , steady , with no shifts , but all hands turned to from start to finish . Would n't have licked her then , only for a lucky thing . When she burned down to her rails , she let in the sea and flooded herself . That held the fire off her cargo oil and at the same time all those tin cases below helped to keep her afloat . On account of that , we finally beat th ' fire . " Both her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heave ' em up again . One of our gang was astride a cable , plannin ' to slip it , when it snapped and hove him into the air like a chip . It was only luck that he missed our decks , comin ' down , and was no worse for a good duckin ' that made him watch his step for a bit . " And then we got our lines on her and worked her up the bay , tied her up , and called it a job . " BUT talkin ' about weather , fog 's as " BUT as anything , when you 're lookin ' for a wreck . Remember the time the old St. Paul ran ashore on the Jersey coast ? " She 'd been feelin ' her way through a thick night and that mornin ' th ' leadsman sung out ' 17 fathoms ' when he only had ' seven . ' A man might make that mistake when he 's hurryin ' his soundin 's , for both are marked the same ? a red rag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next they know on the bridge , there they are , hard and fast . . " They rolled me out that mornin ' , when the word came , and the first thing I heard was how another company 's gang had an hour 's start on us . " ' Well , ' says I , ' maybe ' t is as thick where they are as it is here ? and anyhow we 've the legs o ' their boat . ' " So we had . And away we went , jammin ' our tug down th ' coast for all that was in her . You understand I was  | wreckmaster , not cap'n of the boat , and her skipper says to me , Cap'n , I do n't like this runnin ' four bells an ' a jingle when I ca n't see where I 'm goin ' . ' All right , cap'n , ' says I , you go down in th ' bow and then , if we hit anything , you can step off nice and comfortable . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , when we found old Shrewsbury buoy under our forefoot where we wanted her , and knew just where we were . Pretty soon after that , there was the ship loomin ' up , stuck in about 13 foot o ' water , for'ard . Felt better , then , when I heard the other gang had missed her somehow , and gone too far to sea . " Well , we got our lines aboard her , run out anchors , and hooked on . By that time the fog had lifted some , and the passengers were transferrin ' to another liner that had been sent down on account of business men bein ' held up , and opera singers takin ' cold , and so on . " THAT 'S the regular thing , but did you ever mark how the passengers go off growlin ' at the steamship company and damnin ' the ship 's commander just when th ' heart 's knocked out of him through spottin ' a fine record of maybe 30 years ' standin ' ? ' T is so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her off ? not even with the other gang 's tug helping after she turned up . It was a case of lighten ship ? hoist her boats out , cut off her davits , and rouse up cargo . She carried about a million and a half in gold , that run , and ? " Captain Mac interrupted himself to chuckle , and then went on : " Ye mind , this was before the hold-up days . Plenty o ' gales but no crime waves ! We just shoved that gold under a tarpaulin in a boat with two or three men and sent her up to the city . Take a regiment o ' marines , likely , nowadays , to put that gold in bank ! " Well , in a case like that , gettin ' a ship off means havin ' lines out , bow or quarter , or both , and good anchors laid just so , to take the strain . Then you haul away ? and hold ? and haul again ? to make nothin ' , sometimes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong bearin ' and carry away the whole business so you have to begin again . It was my good luck we . caught the right breeze that day , to walk the St. Paul off nice and easy , and leave her not much the worse . " SO IT goes with Captain Mac and his fellow salvors . First they have a job of straight lifting , like the 51 . Next , it is a big ship to haul off , or a diving and torch job or , again , a case where a patch can be bolted over a stove-in hull to make it tight . Then , perhaps , the water can be blown out of compartments and replaced by air that must bring the ship up . But , as Captain Mac reminds us , the pressure must be reduced regularly as she rises , or " she 'll blow her deck loose as she hits th ' surface and go down again like lead . " It all takes practice and experience , as the same veteran pointed out to the navy  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing the sunken Spaniards . " Best let our gang go at ' em in their own way , without too much help . A navy man 's brought up different ? ' t is his job to sink the other man 's ships ? not raise ' em ! " There is certainly a lure to the game . with its ever-different jobs and their possibilities ? a lure that brings to it men of every color ' and every race , to hold them until they lose an arm in a jammed tackle or burst a Mood-vessel 100 feet under water . You find ancient , retired divers hanging about the salvor 's docks , and long-pensioned wreckmasters listening in the night for the emergency call that may find all the active men at work elsewhere and only themselves available . Perhaps the charm began ' way back in history , when the words " flotsam " and " jetsam " first came into the language ; or when neighboring British towns quarreled over the ownership of a barrel of whisky afloat in the bay adjacent to both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish Main to our own day of the Laurentic and Lusitania ; adventure and treasure-hunting , always fostered by the sailorman 's refusal to be beaten by the tireless , unchanging sea . YEAR by year , the tonnage restored to service by the salvors rolls up into the millions . Frequently , too , they do a life-saving job by being the first on hand or by backing up , with their powerful ocean-going craft , some little coastguard cutter 's valiant tugging at a big schooner or steamer , disabled in the breakers ' grip . An exciting game , and worth playing . " It never lets a man alone , no matter where he is , " said another old-timer . " Why , there was a young feller in the business for himself , with a small crew ? Dan , we all called him . Seems he was down in Nassau , one time , on a holiday , with a wife he 'd married three days bef ore . " In comes word of a tanker thrown up around Cat Island somewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeymooning and away in a motor-boat with the wife , to be first on board . " She was abandoned , when they got to her ? all hands gone in the boats , radio carried away , boilers under water , and all the rest of it . But he sends back his boat , with a cable for his crew and another making a bid forth ' job , and then the two o ' them sit down to see nobody walks off with their ship . " Ten days or so they was out there , hanging by their teeth to that reef through one gale that mighty near broke the ship 's back under their feet . But in the end they got the job all right ? and when the crew come down ? they did it ! "  |
