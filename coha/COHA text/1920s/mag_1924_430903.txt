It is not a hard word ? archaeology ; and it gets easier to say every day . The discovery of a Pharaoh 's tomb pushed the livest of men and the liveliest of events off the front page of the newspapers of the whole world . Why is it that in nearly every country on this earth people are working as feverishly to get back into the past as they are to get ahead into the future ? Is it not because those civilizations of long ago , which we have taken for granted as dead and gone , are again alive and with us , challenging our civilizations , quickening our interest ; in fact , stirring our very being ? There always has been interest in archaeology . People have always picked up , looked at , wondered about the objects used and left by those who had gone before . The Roman emperor Augustus was an archaeologist when  | he caused a dozen obelisks , made by Egyptians longer before his day than from his day until now , to be shipped to Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each backbone ( spina ) round which the chariots raced . The modern Turk or Arab is an archaeologist when he hunts up ancient writings carved in stone . He has noticed that foreigners scan those writings eagerly . He is a bad archaeologist , however , because he believes that the unknown writing is telling the foreigner where a treasure is hidden ; so he breaks the stone to pieces , either to keep the stranger from finding the treasure or because he thinks the gold is inside the stone itself . It is not much more than a hundred years since real archaeology began . By that is meant the scientific search by governments or individuals for the relics of the past . It is hard to say which is most exciting : to discover things whose beauty transcends our own loveliest works of art ; to find things the monetary value of which runs into millions ; to study civilizations stratified in ages past ; or to hunt for objects which no one has seen for thousands of rears . At all events , the whole world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somewhere history suddenly takes a backward leap of a hundred or a thousand years as some forgotten city is discovered ; not a fortnight but that a pot of money is found where its owner hid it a thousand years or so ago ; not a month passes but that a new magazine or book on archaeology appears ; not a night but that theaters show a pageant of Babylon or Egypt or Rome , the splendors of which are but the reflection of the past as mirrored in the archaeological discoveries of the present . The good sense of an English diplomat a century ago saved the magnificant sculptures of the Parthenon of Athens ; the chance find of the Rosetta Stone and a Frenchman 's skill at deciphering it gave us the secrets of Egypt ; the dreams of a German schoolboy were finally made real by his discovery of the ancient Troy of Homer ; the steady , fearless work of Americans has given us the  | facts about the cliff dwellers of our own Southwest , and is laying bare the mystery of the Mayas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a science , it is in a fair way to become a fad . When some years ago a young Greek naval officer was sailing about taking soundings in the ATgean Sea , suddenly his eyes nearly fell out into the water as his ship sailed along over an ancient city , three miles in circumference , which lay all peaceful there fifty to a hundred feet below his gliding keel . A peasant cleaning out a spring in Italy came upon some coins of the later Roman empire , and digging down found a thousand years of money . From it scholars learned the religious story of a millennium of worshipers who threw a coin into the spring with a prayer to the deity who lived deep in its depths . An accidental glance at the roof of a cave in Spain disclosed rude carvings of animals ages since extinct , and science has proved that those carvings were made tens of centuries ago . In Italy they plow in a vineyard and strike the top of an old cistern and find in it skeletons surrounded with dishes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the bar is a sentence scratched there more than five hundred years before Christ . In Greece a train has engine trouble . Two of the passengers take their luncheon a half mile away to the top of a low hill , where to their amazement broken pieces of ancient pottery lie about . They return a few months later with workmen and soon lay bare a chieftain 's village . They came across a room full of all sorts of pottery , and can say with certainty that here more than a thousand  | years before Christ the inhabitants of this house added to their income by selling tableware to the travelers along the NaupliaCorinth interurban trade route . And now in Egypt , after months and years of hope deferred , while digging here and delving there , suddenly there appear steps which have led to a greater than Aladdin , to an Egyptian Pharaoh 's tomb where untold treasures are . Of good things , the more there are the more you want . That is the reason why there is now a three-cornered race between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich collectors , both local and foreign , and the scientific arch2eological museums or societies . The last named must win at the expense of the other two , for only thus will the true historical value of the objects found be preserved . At the same time the first-named group must be fairly repaid , and the second group must have as a return for their money a fair distribution of the objects found to the museums and collections in all the cultured countries of the world . Harmful , not helpful , are such attempts as that in 1911 of a party of wealthy Englishmen who , on the basis of a supposed cipher , set out to bribe their way to the discovery of the supposed hidden treasure of David and of the Temple of Jerusalem . How much more important are the recent discoveries of the sites of a dozen lost Biblical towns ; how much more valuable in the long run are the excavations since 1912 at Beth-Eshemesh , which laid bare stratified deposits from the Neolithic Age down to the time of the Captivity ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third to sixth century A. D. , which was bought in Cairo , Egypt , in 1909 , furnishes a good proof of the argument just advanced . Here , among other fine things , all of gold , were two pectorals , three medallions , seven necklaces , a breast chain , six earrings , eleven bracelets , and a beautiful cross set with emeralds . All the gold pieces were studded with pearls , sapphires , amethysts , and emeralds . More money was paid for the collection as a whole than the pieces would have brought had they been sold stealthily and singly , Besides that , the entire collection is still together where it can be seen , and it has also been carefully photographed and published . Now it is available for almost everyone . It is , however , not the great finds that necessarily attract the most interest ; at least , there is hardly a find , however small , that fails to yield something that stirs the imagination or increases the general stock of information . One has an intimate fellow feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of then brings a smile of now . Not long ago there was turned up a Greek ostracon , a piece of shell or sherd , on which in Greek was written : " Diogenes , the Cynic philosopher , when asked by one who saw an Ethiopian eating white bread , said , " T is night devouring day . ' " No less interesting than the beautiful jewelry and diadem of an Egyptian found in 1914 and called the Treasure of Lahun are the alabaster jars in which her cosmetics were kept , and the copper knives and the copper razors with gold handles . One of our American universities has a collection of thirty-five bronze surgical in- struments of the first and second centuries of our era , which were found at Colophon in Asia Minor . The surgeons of the University 's Medical School came to see them and were amazed to find their own knives , forceps , probes , cupping vessels , bow drills , catheters , etc. , right before them , except that their own twentieth-century steel was harder , not sharper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries ago . If one would know how the ancients cooked , it is not far to a certain museum in " Toronto full of Roman cooking utensils , found for the most part in Egypt ? kettles , colanders , ladles , baking and frying pans , meat hooks and choppers , and all the rest . After one has sat at the edge of an excavation hole and seen three little earthenware cups dug up , has seen them emptied , and has watched two ivory dice and twenty-four glass counters , six of a color , fall from the dirt of each one , and realizes that those cups have been there since 82 B. C. , he never again plays parchesi without recalling the ancient Romans . When one sees silver coins dug up that have on one side pictures of men casting the Australian ballot of two thousand and more years ago ; when one looks at the bronze disk found in 1911 in Epirus , Greece , and learns from coins and other sources how to expand the monogram on the disk into the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot nearly two thousand five hundred years old ; when one walks along the streets of Pompeii and reads the signs painted on the walls asking the passer-by to vote for So-and-So for mayor , or for street commissioner , one has a strange fellow feeling for those folk . Long ago they were doing what we have not yet learned to do much better . Treasure-trove is more than the stuff that dreams are made of . Archxological treasure-trove is more than gold or gems , more than the gas or oil or ore that fills the material subsoil of a land ; it is that richer subsoil of ancient  | civilization which yields to patient search the coins that make the science of numismatics drive the mere acquisition of coin to shameful cover ; which invests the panoply of war or court or tomb with human value ; which , with its discovered treasures , be they manuscripts , statues , or homely articles of household use , makes modern life fuller and finer . Who would not lose sleep , spend time and money , undergo hardships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years ago , who found in Vest China , at the " Caves of the Thousand Buddhas , " a library that had been walled up in the tenth century , which when opened disclosed a solid mass of five hundred cubic feet of manuscripts of Tibetan , Chinese , Turkish , Sogdian , and Sanskrit ? Who would not have felt the throb of discovery when a roll dated 860 A. D. came out of the mass , and the realization with it that the earliest date for printing could now he pushed back more than a hundred years ? And as a result of that find the British Museum is now richer by some three hundred paintings , and fourteen thousand documents , and manuscripts in more than twelve languages . If one wishes to compare the work of a French or Turkish peasant on his farm to-day with farmers of long ago , how better to do so than to look at a seal stone found in 1910 in Babylonia of the fourteenth century B. C. ? On this stone is a scene that was engraved over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plow . The driver holds both plow handles and he runs his furrow , and a second man with a bag on his shoulder drops seed into an attached drill . In 1909 , off Madia in Tunis , a sunken ship was found . Two thousand years ago it foundered , On its deck , far below the surface of the blue Mediterranean , lay seven piles of unfluted marble columns , sixty-five of them in all . But , best of all , Africa has given to an admiring world a marble divinity , the Venus of Cyrene , who for purity of line , grace of form , and skill of execution has stepped into the front rank of the immortals ? the immortal  | marble dead of the Greek sculptor 's chisel . In no place does excavation thrive more than in England . Since 1906 excavation has been going on at , Corbridge , and by 1913 it was possible to show that here the Romans , in preparation for their campaigns against Scotland begun under Agricola , had built a great fortress and store base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tile and pottery works of the soldiers of the Twentieth Legion . There are nine great kilns with parallel flues , crosschannels and upcasts , drying-rooms and all . Lying about were some perfect vessels of fine workmanship , scores of unbaked pots , thousands of broken sherds , pieces of molds , potters ' dies , tools , and appliances . One tile has a legionary stamp on it , and by it a soldier has scratched his name and cohort , which we know from other sources was in Britain in 124 A , D. , and in garrison in 210 at Carnarvon ( a name now enshrined in archmological memory ) . In November of 1922 Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter , in the Valley of the Kings , near Thebes in Egypt , dug underneath the tomb of Rameses VI . Truly a strange place to seek ! But one Pharaoh still was unaccounted for ? Tutankhamen . A stairway came to view . It led deep down to an outer room . This had been robbed in antiquity of its precious metals , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variety beggar description . On February 16 , 1923 , the burial chamber was opened . Under a gilded canopy was a second canopy within which lay the royal sarcophagus . An adjoining burial chamber was crowded with wonderful works of art of every kind . Perhaps  | the world 's greatest single find , thus far , was found . A year later Tutankhamen 's pink sarcophagus came to view . A discovery in Sardis on April 13 , 1922 , also made the world gape wide with wonder . In a small pot of coarse gray clay , found not far below the surface of the soil , lay thirty solid gold staters of the Lydian king Crsus , whose great name still attaches to every man who attains extraordinary wealth . Within the last few years the city of Rome has again come into the limelight of archeology . Just outside one of the gates a workman on the railroad drove his pick into and through the roof of a subterranean edifice . Soon architects , artists , archxologists , and historians alike were wild with enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete with a lava core poured in , and after the roof and arches had been built over a natural framework of earth the interior had then been excavated . Artists exclaimed over the wonderful stucco reliefs that covered nearly every inch of the great area of walls and ceiling , and all the world is still arguing as to the why and wherefore of this subterranean basilica-like edifice with its fine nave and side aisles . General interest , however , attaches in nearly equal measure to the paintings on the walls and ceilings of three subterranean chambers in the Viale Manzoni in Rome , and to the new catacomb of Pamphilus on the Via Salaria Vetus , with its galleries intact and its loculi full of coins , ivories , glass vessels , altars , and rock  | crystal statuettes of fine workmanship . Ostia , Rome 's seaport , is fast outstripping Pompeii in. itc interest and value to the student of ancient life and manners . But the greatest of the European finds during the last two decades has been made in Russia , especially South Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there , and who knows now whether a great part of the finds may not again have disappeared forever ? Of the hundreds of finds , one , that of a Scythian royal tomb of the fourth century B. C. at Soloka , near Melitopol on the lower Dnieper , is most worthy of notice . Here was found a tomb , intact . The king and all his treasures were within ; his groom and five of his horses , his swordbearer with a great iron sword and bronze-tipped arrows , his body servant , all were there buried with their master . The king , or chieftain , wore a gold collar of ropework pattern , its ends decorated with lion heads round whose necks are designs of palmet.tes and lotus buds on a ground of blue , red , and green enamel . On the king 's right arm arc three massive bracelets of gold , and on his left arm , two . Lying about are scores of repousse gold plaques which once spangled his royal robe . Near by is a magnificent comb with nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouch five lions . On a second gold strip on their backs are three warriors , with two horses , engaged in deadly combat . A little further off lie the king 's gold necklace of tubular beads , his bronze helmet , two iron swords , two spears , a knife , his coat of mail , his great bronze mace , his leather bowcase decorated with a repousse silver design , and seven magnificent silver vases with various names in pictorial repousse . Truly a royal burial ! And what of the Western Hemisphere ?  | Is it so young that it is barren of the past ? Not so ! Early history is full of Incas , Montezumas , Mound Builders , Cliff Dwellers . With every decade their antiquity increases a century , sometimes more . The mounds of the Middle States , the mesas , the pueblos , the dwellings hollowed by art and nature in the beetling cliffs of canyon walls , have absorbed more and more the attention of our people . Chile , Peru , and Mexico have disclosed more remains of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , Guatemala , Honduras , and Yucatan with their ancient peoples , especially the Mayas , are giving us an archology which in antiquity reaches back to , perhaps beyond , the time of Christ , and in splendor of architecture and originality of decoration puts the Western Hemisphere nearly abreast of the civilizations of the Eastern . Though the science has advanced to a sensational degree in the past generation , actually only a beginning has been made in the discovery and interpretation of archeological remains . Only recently we have learned to what extent the races of Asia Minor figured in the early history of civilization . The enormously important records of Babylonia , of Arabia , of China , are still practically untouched . In England , we are reminded by Professor Sayce , eminent British archxologist , " what we already know has disclosed to us how much remains to be known ; even so recent a period as that which created modern England after the overthrow of Roman culture is still a blank . These cities of Roman Britain were destroyed and Roman civilization vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished is still a matter of dispute . " Archeology challenges the modern to help the ancient world , to learn from it what it has to teach , to sympathize with its mistakes , many of which are like unto our own , to glory in its successes . Above all , archology bids every passing and each succeeding age to enter fearlessly and whole-heartedly into its heritage of the glorious past .  |
