The little eight-page newspapers of Paris , brilliant , powerful and many , continue their diurnal animadversions against the United States . Leading the field are the Matin ( edited by Stephen Lausanne , a welcome guest in many American homes ) , the semi-official Temps , the Midi , the Liberte . The text , as a rule , is either the Washington limitation of armaments plan or the debts . Exhibit " A " from the Liberte : " We were the victims at Washington of an Anglo-American combination and two questions of money prevent us from escaping . " <P> The general talk might be summed up thus : " We will accept the Treaty since it is only for ten years . We will pay the debts , if you insist ; but not now . "
