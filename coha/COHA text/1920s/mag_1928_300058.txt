Manhattan banks raised interest rates on 90-day loans to 7% , threatened even higher rates if the demand were heavy . In only three of the last thirty years , and not since the deflation days of 1921 , had time money been so high . Many were the grumblers . Among the loudest , most bitter , was Columnist Arthur Brisbane , who is first a businessman , then a reporter . <P> Columnist Brisbane did more than grumble . He sneered : " Borrowers should send three large gilt balls to be hung above the Federal Reserve Bank entrance , and similar ornaments to some of the big banks . " He threatened : " This is what the law of New York State says , Section 370 : ' The legal rate of interest shall not be more than $6 on $100 for one year . ' Every bank charging more than 6% interest is violating the law and knows it . <P> " . . . When men extort eight per cent for loans on absolutely good security , somebody ought to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve . " <P> But Manhattan 's bankers failed to tremble . They answered neither sneers nor threats . Had they wished , however , they might have said : " We charge no more than the legal 6% interest rate . The additional 1% is a carrying fee , to compensate us for our trouble in carrying the account . " This was , of course , one of many current evasions of the law 's letter .
