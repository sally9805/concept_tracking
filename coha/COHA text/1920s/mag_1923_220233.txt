The old Parisian custom of electing at Mi-Careme ( mid-Lent ) a Queen of Paris from Queens chosen by each of the 20 arrondissements , or wards , in Paris , will be discontinued . A new plan will be pursued by which each arrondissement will choose a " Bee . " From these a " Queen-Bee " will be elected for the whole city . The usual festivities will be much curtailed except for the visit to the President . The Bees are to wear their own gowns instead of having " royal robes " supplied . Girls are to be picked for merit rather than for beauty , as formerly . <P> A French Bureau of Information is to be opened in New York . The data will comprise political , commercial , financial , colonial , industrial , artistic , and literary subjects . <P> Said M. Liebert , Consul-General : " The French Government is just as opposed to any sort of propaganda as are the American people . It is France 's intention to organize , absolutely separate from the Consulate-General , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
