Business , which is rapidly teaching scientists to make fortunes , has lately tried to attract two university chemists who have patented processes of adding vitamins to foods . Dr. Harry Steenboch at the University of Wisconsin invented a way of irradiating foodstuffs with ultraviolet light . Such irradiated foods prevent rickets . When food professors offered him thousands for the use of his patents he organized the Wisconsin Research Foundation , put University of Wisconsin alumni in charge , let the royalties pay for further research . <P> Last week , Business was more successful . Dr. Joseph Keats Marcus , onetime assistant professor of Chemistry at Columbia University , now an employe of Pitman-Moore Co. , Indianapolis pharmaceutical manufacturers , has a process of quickly and efficiently extracting from cod livers the vitamins which promote growth and bone formations . Food manufacturers have bid for licenses to the Marcus process . To exploit that demand , shrewd businessmen last week organized for Dr. Marcus and themselves an International Vitamin Corp. , with 200,000 no-par shares .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
