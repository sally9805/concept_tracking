 |p816  TO ? DAY the cost of a certain necessity is advanced . ' Tomorrow organized labor will advance wages to meet the new level of the cost of living . Then the week following sugar or coal or cotton goods will take another upward step , for the producer and selling agent must maintain their margins of profit undisturbed by the advance of the wages of labor . Business is so organized that it can manipulate the prices of food , fuel , shelter , and clothing almost at will . But labor can also dictate terms . There is no end in sight to the march of prices up an ever-ascending staircase . The process of increasing the cost of these four vital necessities , food , fuel , shelter , and clothing , and of forcing wages up to meet the new scale of expenses has been at work with a new and alarming activity since the beginning of the war in 1914 . Within the given years the cost of living has been doubled and the wages of organized labor doubled to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle becomes apparent when one considers that the eight-dollar carpenter has no more money to spend for high-priced necessities than he had when he was a four-dollar man and the same luxuries cost only half as much . It is an even break for the laborer . True , the business man who buys an article for a dollar and a half and sells it for three makes twice as much money on a single transaction as he made when he bought the same article for seventy-five cents and sold it for a dollar and a half . But his doubled profits buy only the same amount of goods now as the single bought five years ago . He too breaks even , except that he is preyed upon by a panic of fear . Business today is terrorized . It fears that labor is not merely preserving itself but is out on a well-organized  |p817  bolshevik raid upon capital , property , and business , and will not be satisfied until it has pulled the house down on all our heads . What does it profit a man if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a gnawing fear that the golden goose suffers from a mortal distemper and soon must die ? Economists declare that the supply of a necessity , and the demand for it , regulate the price , and that this ascending staircase has a necessary fixed height , determined b ! supply and demand and the volume of money . Perhaps so in times past . This may once have been a dependable economic law operating with the regularity and smoothness of a well-regulated pendulum . But organization of labor and combination and agreement of capital accelerate or retard the swing of the pendulum , as if a human hand were thrust into the works of a clock . Who believes , for example , that supply and demand alone delicately regulate the price of gasoline today ? Or who is convinced that even the retail association of dealers in meats and groceries in his own town stands helpless before the supreme authority of supply and demand ? If society were made up of just the two groups ? capital and labor ? nobody would care much what wages would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling for a dollar a pound , the worker could hold up his employer for ten dollars an hour in wages so as to provide the means to buy sugar and other necessities priced on that scale . And if organized labor should demand wages at the rate of one hundred dollars a day , the bakers could compel labor to pay two dollars for a loaf of bread . But , you will say , this process can not go on forever . The volume of money is fixed , and will not permit such excesses . When " reason and the will of God prevailed " this might have been true , but either organized capital or organized labor can now enforce demands which have nothing to do with either reason or the will of God . Organized labor took advantage of an impending national calamity to compel the Government to pass the Adamson law , and would have tied up transportation at a time when every ton of traffic was needed to preserve the nation and labor itself from falling into the hands of a conscienceless foe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain industries , at a time when both capital  |p818  and labor should have been drafted at a soldier 's pay for the period of the war . Extremists of either group know nothing of economic laws . When you tell the bolshevist that the volume of money limits wages , he points you to the printing press and asks , Why limit the volume of money ? There is a bolshevism in business as well as in labor , just as unreasoning , just as determined to get all that 's going without thought of ultimate consequences . These two have not been slow to make demands which set at nought all economic law ; and the public has been obliged , up to this date , to find a way to meet these demands . Of course , those who see far know that the economic laws are only delayed in their action , and that the crash is yet inevitable , though temporarily deferred . Unfortunately society is not organized into just the two classes , capital and labor . If it were , and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , the disinterested observer on Mars or the moon could slangily say , " Go to it " . There is , however , a defenseless third interest , that views with apprehension the battle of the giants . This third observes the cost of necessities double and treble while its own means of purchasing food , and fuel , and clothing , and shelter remain fixed or are advanced only a poor five or ten per cent . The usefulness of all endowed institutions is cut in half when their money buys only half of what it once bought . This means colleges and universities , the intellectual balance wheels of a republic whose people must think if the nation is to endure . It means charitable institutions . An orphan asylum which could care for two hundred children in 1914 , is limited to one hundred in 1920 . A soldier 's widow , by the doubling of the cost of living , sees with dismay her few pension dollars shrink into halves . Eight hundred thousand teachers , men and women , have seen their meager salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . There are preachers , writers , clerks , stenographers , postal employees , firemen , policemen , and unorganized mental and physical workers by the millions who have been robbed ? there is no other word for it ? by capital and labor as these within five years have taken away half the purchasing power of the dollar . These people , too , are the very salt of the earth . They make life worth living . They give Matthew Arnold 's  |p819  " sweetness and light " to the very world in which capital and labor must live . But they can not strike . A charitable or educational institution can not strike . Preachers can not strike . Teachers can not strike . None of the men and women who do the kinds of work which make the country worth living in can organize and strike for higher wages . Capital may say that preachers and teachers should quit if they do n't like the pay . Labor may declare that those who do not produce with their hands have no right to live . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country would speedily become a howling waste place with no law but the will of the strong , and no social consciousness but that of tooth and claw . Even the faintest glimmer of wisdom should prompt capital to pay the brains of the country ? the teachers , preachers , social workers , writers , clerks , etc. ? such wages as would enable these to live contentedly , and to have more of the means to live than those who do not have the desire or the means or the brains to educate themselves to do the world 's thinking for it . But even that could not long be effective . The wages of the voiceless third can never keep pace with the ever ascending spiral of wages and the cost of things which the struggle of the giants creates . There must be instituted some device to stabilize wages and costs for all three of the groups interested . There must be no forced ascending spiral . The new usury , a polite term for industrial theft , must be circumvented . Usury in the renting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be charged . There is a maximum annual profit charged for the use of money . Beyond this no man may go without bringing down upon himself the wrath of law . The laws of usury should be extended to labor and to other necessary commodities , as they are now applied to money . To stabilize the value of money and goods there should be a fixed maximum profit allowed on shoes , on clothing , on cloth in the piece , on farm products which are to be converted into food , clothing , shelter , or fuel , on every one of the necessities of life . Take coal as an illustration . The owner of coal land should have his just profit ; the mine owner should have his fixed net profit above the cost of mining ; transportation should have its fixed profit above the actual cost of service ; and finally  |p820  the local dealer should have his fixed profit for selling coal to the consumer . To determine what would be a just and liberal profit for each partner in this industry would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ; but nothing worth while is impossible . These calculations and adjustments can be made . Beet sugar is produced in large quantities where I live . The steps in sugar-producing are few and may be easily reckoned . A farmer raises beets ? what are his costs per ton , and what is a reasonable profit ? A factory turns these into sugar ? how much actual money is invested in the physical equipment of the factory ( not watered stock upon which profits must be paid ) , and how much does it cost to change beets into sugar ? Then a reasonable maximum profit for transportation and retail selling could be allowed , and a just and stable selling price to the consumer determined . The necessities of life ? food , fuel , shelter , and clothing ? are not so numerous as to make it impossible to determine the cost of production and to add thereto a reasonable maximum profit to the producer or seller . Public opinion alone can never dictate what is a maximum wage for labor or a maximum profit for grower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined by law . The penalty for profiteering ( modern theft and robbery ) should be heavy fines and imprisonment for the guilty . I , personally , would go even farther . Surely anyone who deliberately prevents or limits the production , transportation , or marketing of one of the necessities of life plots against the very existence of the nation ; commits treason to his country . Expert commissioners should fix prices , profits , and equitable wages . And then there should be added a quickacting automatic safety clutch . Upon every article displayed for sale both the cost price and the selling price in plain figures should be attached . The penalty for lying about these should be the same as for profiteering . The American people are a fair people and are willing to allow every man a square deal and a fair profit . If a man goes into a store to buy a hat and finds the price ticket marked : " Wholesale cost $2.38 , transportation ? .12 , operating margin ? .48 , net profit ? .60 . Selling price $3.58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had to pay six dollars for a hat that he suspected had cost the dealer only two . These citations will serve to make clear what I mean by the new usury , and the devices to prevent it . As usury is an overcharge for the use of money , so should there be a new usury law to prevent overcharges for the use of the other cardinal necessaries of life ? food , fuel , clothing and shelter ? and labor . The remedy offered is the fixing of a reasonable profit for the production and marketing of the necessaries of life , and a provision for a vigorous prosecution of the usurer . In addition the white light of publicity as to cost and profit should be played upon all goods offered for sale . Labor , too , must submit to reason . The great common mass of American citizens , rich and poor , labor and capital , and the voiceless third , has shown more than once , and supremely in 1917 , how it could rise and respond as one man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that is past , and today labor has taken its cue from profiteering capital and seems now to be out on a wild border raid of grabbing everything in sight while it is the fashion to grab . The laborer sees the corporation he works for taking unwarranted profits , and he too demands similar unwarranted profits upon his toil . There is a tendency everywhere to grant to working men better working conditions , better living conditions , insurance against loss of time through sickness or injury , service and old age pensions , and even a voice in the management of the business in which they are employed ? a tendency to grant freely and as just dues all the conditions which make for industrial democracy . The intention of all level-headed and far-seeing Americans is to deal justly with both capital and labor . America stands for fair dealing . We are not unthinking idealists , but as a mass we simply see that it is best for all to be contented , moderately prosperous , well provided with the necessaries , and with a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , a sufficient number of bolsheviks in business and bolsheviks among laboring men who demand unreasonable returns from trade and labor . These men have dominated the situation , and they now compel sane and moderate good citizens to make demands which are virtually robbery to those who have to pay .  |p822  These must be restrained , be they millionaires , profiteers in the necessities of life , or mule drivers in coal mines . The Government of the United States , the people , must say to all such that any profit beyond a fixed limit is usury , and subject to the penalties of usury . After instituting commissions to fix reasonable profits on goods , and reasonable returns for labor when the costs of living are stabilized at a given level , after compelling the display of cost price and selling price upon all goods offered for sale , there is yet a third force to be called into operation to save the country from a mad stampede to destruction . This third force is a nation-wide propaganda to appeal to the American people as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotic recognition of fair play and fair returns for all honest work . Our people readily heard the call of every distress during the period of the war . They responded generously , lavishly , from the humblest laborer to the richest capitalist . Is there no possibility of the three parties concerned , capital , labor and the voiceless third , coming to an agreement concerning what is just and generous for all classes , and then by a campaign of publicity through newspapers , magazines , pulpits , schools , public addresses , cartoons , posters , dodgers ? all the machinery which was used in the war drives ? to persuade the people to accept a reign of economic justice in this country , no matter how wildly Europe may run amuck ? Whether the proposals set forth in this paper are found reasonable in the long run , or merely the voice of one overtaken by darkness and seeking for a flicker of guiding light , is yet to be seen . But a fact is before us . We are in besetting dangers . Wages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capital must know ahead what supply of material and labor it can depend upon ; and labor must be able to know beforehand what wages it may expect and how far those wages will go toward paying for the means to live . Such an arrangement will be best for both , and such an arrangement will also enable the voiceless and defenseless third to live and do its work in a needy world undisturbed by the unhindered , uncontrolled usury of the twentieth century ? a new usury that , unless checked , will bring the world to disaster .
