txt Protesting against " automatically extreme punishment for lesser crimes , " Kings County Judge Franklin W. Taylor appealed personally to the five Justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in Brooklyn yesterday to support his stand against enforcement of the Baumes laws In the way detnatIded by District Attorney Charles J. Dddd . It was the first time , court attaches said , that a rrember of the Kings County judicir.ry had appeared to argue his own case . Judge Taylor came to appeal from a peremptory mandamus order commanding him to cause the production from Sing Sing of Harry Simmons , a negro convicted before him as a first offender , and to make him plead as a fourth offender on supplemental information filed by Mr. Dodd . Supreme Court Justice Harry . E. Lewis had signed the order . A crowded court room listened as Judge Taylor argued against the interpretation of the Baumes laws which would make this procedure mandatory . Finishing his explanation of the legal points involved , he urged in quiet tones that justice should not be subordinated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be reformed ; Judges should not be made automatons in dealing with them . Says His Views Were Distorted . Defying what he called distorted criticism of his views , he declared his duty was clear . " If to be a Judge meant to be a moral coward , then I would resign at once , " he said . " When this case came before me , " he asserted , " I realized the responsibility involved in my decision . I decided it according to what seemed to me to be the law , and without regard to whom it might please or displease . My guiding star was the judicial oath . Yet because some people did not understand the facts I was falsely painted as being hostile to the Baumes laws in general . A Judge 's duty under such circumstances is well defined . He must keep his head and do what he believes to be right . My reputation for administering drastic penalties to gross offenders is well known , but I have never seen justification for automatically extreme punishment for lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the case , explaining that Simmons had been indicted last September for second-degree grand larceny as a second offender for having misappropriated $116.75 while working for a Brooklyn coal company . Upon his being brought to trial , the District Attorney moved that the Court accept a plea of guilty as a first offender , and Judge Taylor accordingly sentenced him on that record . Later the District Attorney filed information of three prior convictions and asked the pris- oner 's recall tor tesentence to a life term , in accordance with Section 1942 of the Penal Code , one of the Baumes laws . Cites the Questions Involved . Judge Taylor said the two questions now before the Court were whether he had the right to sentence a man otherwise than in accordance with his conviction , which in this case , he said , was as a first offender , and whether the provisions involved in the Baumes laws were mandatory . He argued that the accepVince of the original plea was an adjudication that the prisoner was a first offender , especially since Court and District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the indictment had alleged a previous offense . Justice Isaac M. Kapper interrupted to remark : " Then your interpretation is that where a plea is accepted that eliminates the defendant 's prior convictions ? " Judge Taylor answered that it was , declaring that principles of honor should continue to apply when the Court was dealing with defendants . Calling for the administration of justice with understanding , he reminded the Court that Henry George , the economist , at one time ' field up a man Ion the street and took , $2 , and that a contemporary dramatist had been a notorious criminal . " Those , " he sa4g. ? " who in a fanatical I reaction againsra tituation which they , honestly misunderstand demand al false and strained construction , contrary to all rules of statutory interpretation , making mandatory a life sentence for all fourth offenders , regardless of the merits of the indivdual case , should pause in sober realization that they in turn must some day ask for mercy and that ' God is love , His mercy shining .

The Justices frankly confessed they were puzzled as to what concrete issue was before them . " The prisoner may be brought back and admit at once he was a fourth offender , " Presiding Justice William J. Kelly said . " Until he appeals from a judgment how is all this ' before us ? " " I am frank to say I do n't know , " Mr. Walsh said . " All we want now is to bring the man down from Sing Sing . " " It seems to me , too , " said Justice Daniel F. Manning . " that it is simply a matter of getting him here . " Justice Kelly also agreed , saying that the question of whether a life sentence was discretionary was not at issue now . When Mr. Walsh attempted to continue his argument Justice Kelly ended the hearing . The decision of the Court was reserved . In his brief Mr. Walsh argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment and not the offense was the matter in controversy . The Legislature , he said , had plainly pro . vided that no matter what the grade of offense or what the plea.for which a defendant was found guilty , if he had been convicted of other felonies he would have to be punished accordingly , even though the indictment had not set forth prior convictions ..
