A Lieutenant Governor rode in a carriage beside a Governor . Red-coated foot guards made a guard of honor . Cavalry , an additional protection , pranced in the parade . A State Capitol was reached . The Lieutenant Governor entered . The Legislature had just declared him elected for two years as Governor of the State . He took the oath of office . He delivered a very long inaugural address-9,000 words . That evening , a great ball was given for him in the armory of the foot guards . He stayed up late . Next morning early , he rose , went to Capitol , tendered to the Secretary of State his resignation as Governor . A few minutes later , he took an oath as U. S. Senator . Not much more than an hour later he took train for the Nation 's capital . All this within less than 24 hours . <P> Such was a day from the life of Hiram Bingham , onetime South American explorer , onetime Yale professor , a Republican , for two years a Lieutenant Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Senator . <P> Elected Lieutenant Governor two years and more ago , elected Governor while Lieutenant Governor and Senator while Governor-elect , his course resembles that of Proteus , lightening-change artist of mythology . <P> In his gubernatorial inaugural address , he called attention to the fact that there was a precedent ( that of David B. Hill , who served both as Governor of New York and as Senator ) according to which he might hold both offices , but declared that he did not believe it was good policy to do so , and repeated this opinion in resigning next morning . <P> John H. Trumbull , having meanwhile served a few hours as Lieutenant Govnor , then became Governor of Connecticut ; and now Mr. Bingham sits in the Senate in the place of the late Senator Brandegee.
