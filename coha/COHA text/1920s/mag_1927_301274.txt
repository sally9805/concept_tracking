" We are going to land , " scribbled Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd on a slip of paper . He crawled back through the fuselage of the giant Fokker monoplane , America , handed the paper to Lieut . George 0 . Noville who was lying on the floor , exhausted , temporarily deafened by the roar of the motors . " It was just as if he were handing me an invitation to tea , " said Lieutenant Noville . The paper was shown to Lieut . Bert Balchen who was piloting the plane , and to Bert Acosta who was so deaf and so miserable that he did not seem to care what happened . <P> For five hours , they had been flying over France , lost in a fog that obscured land and the tips of the America 's wings . Once , for a moment , they thought they saw rows of squat bath houses on a beach . Again , there seemed to appear a faint haze of light-perhaps it was Paris or the beacons at Le Bourget airport . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds , " Commander Byrd later told the New York Times , " there were at times some terrible views . We would look hundreds of feet into fog valleys-dark ominous depths . At times the cloud peaks on the horizon looked exactly like a land of mountains . At other times they took on the appearance of a beautiful lake or river . . . . " <P> Their earth inductor compass had fits of running wild , their radio had become disabled , they were fast running out of gasoline-when suddenly at 3 a. m. they saw the sea-coast and the flicker of a lighthouse beacon beneath them . That was the moment when Commander Byrd scribbled : " We are going to land . " It was safer to drop into the sea than to crash into unyielding , un known , fog-blanketed land , he decided . <P> So Lieutenant Balchen piloted the America into the waves , as gently as possible . The impact hurled Commander Byrd , watching at his cabin window , into the sea . He saw Lieutenant Noville climbing out of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swam to the cockpit , helped Lieutenant Balchen extricate himself from the wreckage . Everyone yelled for Bert Acosta-he was not in the cabin-but soon he appeared out of the dark waves . Two days later , a Paris surgeon discovered that Mr. Acosta had a fractured collarbone , the only serious injury of the crash . <P> The four men in a fog inflated their pneumatic tub , paddled 200 yards to the shore of the little fishing village of Ver-sur-Mer , where in 1588 one of the prides of the Spanish Armada had been shattered on the rocks . Lieutenant Noville twice returned to the America 's wreck to save the first transatlantic air mail , a tiny Betsy Ross flag for President Gaston Doumergue of France , some of Commander Byrd 's scientific data . <P> Aroused from sleep , the villagers of Ver-sur-Mer aided in dragging the America into shallow water , bringing ashore the three Wright Whirlwind engines which had not once whimpered during the flight . Although the distance between Roosevelt Field , L. I. , and Ver-sur-Mer on the coast of Normandy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew some 4,200 miles during its 42 hours ' journey .
