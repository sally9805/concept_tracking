ARMY &; NAVY <P> In the summer of 1895 , it was not matter of newspaper headline comment that the graduating class of Amherst College had voted " unanimously with one exception " that Dwight Whitney Morrow , one of its number , was " most likely to succeed , " and that that one exception was D. W. Morrow , who had voted for Calvin Coolidge , his classmate . <P> The headlines in local newspapers took some notice in succeeding years when Coolidge ' 95 was elected to minor offices : Selectman , Member of the State Legislature , etc . But they took no notice of his classmate Morrow when he was made a member of the New York law firm of Simpson , Thatcher &; Bartlett . <P> The headlines did not begin to put much emphasis on Mr. Morrow , until as a successful lawyer he was invited into another field , to become a partner in J. P. Morgan &; Co . To be sure , in a short time Massachusetts papers began referring to " Governor Coolidge , " but Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as headlines were concerned , for the Morgan " member of the Military Board of Allied Supply who received the Distinguished Service medal for his unostentatious service abro I " was more interesting to the country than an obscure governor . <P> Then came a series of " accidents " and the headline situation was reversed . A police strike in Boston , a wearied Republican Convention , a landslide in 1920 , a sudden death , and another landslide in 1924-made " Coolidge " the headline name . " Coolidge " still is . <P> Headline personalities are made all the time . Just recently an army officer made himself into that very thing by contending that " the air 's the thing . " Having reached into the headlines some months ago , he reached into them again when the Shenandoah fell and inscribed the name of . " Mitchell " in bold black letters , coupling it with a fierce denunciation of incompetence in Army and Navy administration of their air forces . <P> Having brought himself and air into the headlines , Mitchell saw Coolidge appoint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Morrow " rose as head of the air investigation board . " Morrow " is not likely to displace " Mitchell " in the headlines for some time yet , but there is evidence that the U. S. public is learning more and more about Morrow . <P> Consider the difference in the men : Mitchell swift in attack , Morrow deliberate in consideration ; <P> Mitchell aerial in mind and speech ; Morrow quiet spoken , judicial-minded . Even in so slight a matter as broken appointments they differ : Mitchell restrained from attending an American Legion Convention by orders to attend a Court Martial ; Morrow sending his regrets to the American Bankers ' Association because he is too busy in Washington .
