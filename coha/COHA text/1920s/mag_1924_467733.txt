W. M. Thackeray to Albany Fonblanque Richmond , Virginia . March 4 ( 1853 ) My dear Fonblanque , I hope you have kept carefully all those " Letters of a traveller in America " which will form the basis of my future work in 6 volumes ? the drawings are not the least valuable part , do n't you think so ? Entre noun young Crowe touched them up and ? enough of this small joking which may reach you about the First of April and which please put down to the compliments of that waggish season . I 've not written a word that 's the truth . I 've seen and remarked nothing : in the great cities I had hardly leisure to write to my family and those one or two kind female correspondentesses to whom a man writes not about the country lie is travelling in , but about himself ? and all I have to say about this great country that 's worth saying might be put down on the remainder of this side of ( the ) paper . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No man should write about-the country under 5 years of experience , and as many of previous reading . A visit to the Tombs , to Laura Bridgman and the Blind Asylum , a description of Broadway 0 Lord is that describing America ? It 's a mole or a pimple on the great Republican body or a hair of his awful beard and no more . I have hardly seen as much as that ; and gave up sight-seeing at once as impossible to a man in my position here . Your room is besieged all day by visitors , you go about from dinner to tea-party and ball , and the people do n't talk to you but try and make you talk . " Well Sir , how do you like our Country Sir ? " that 's the formula and as you are answering this query , the host comes up and says " Allow me Sir to introduce you to Mr. Jones of Alabama , Sir " ? shake hands with Jones of Alabama , query as before ; it is not answered when you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very well Sir , " says S of T. , " your works are extensively read among us , allow me to present you to My Lady , Sir , who is a great admirer of , " etc. ? Mrs. Smith of Tennessee then commences , " How do you like our etc . Sir " ? and , by heaven , evening after evening passes off in this way . I know 100 people more every day , and walk the street in terror lest every man and lady I meet should be my acquaintance of the night before . It makes one half crazy , the constant representation ? and what must it have been in Dickens 's time when deputations met him daily and his life was watched by myriads of admirers ? I have refused to be a personage with all my might , nor indeed has there been much of that sort of honour thrust upon me ; and though I have had plenty of praise from the newspapers I have had plenty of assaults too which were quite refreshing . Ah Monsieur ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t' other side of the water , how invigorating and pleasant it would be ! There are e dear friends I know of in my beloved country ? O for the day when Makepeace might just cease to be Makepeace and ' go in ' ! A great good wh. an Englishman who has seen men and cities gets by coming hither , is that he rubs a deal of Cockney arrogance off , and finds men and women above all as good as our own . You learn to sympathise with a great hearty nation of N millions of English-speakers , not quite ourselves but so like the difference is not worth our scorn certainly ; nay I 'm not sure I do n't think the people are our superiors . There 's a rush and activity of life quite astounding , a splendid recklessness about money wh. has in it something admirable too . Dam the money says every man . He 's as good as the richest for that day . If he wants champagne he has champagne , Mr. Astor ca n't do more . You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has something hearty and generous in it . I like the citizenship and general freedom . And in the struggles wh. every man with whom you talk is pretty sure to have had , the ups and downs of his life , the trades or professions he has been in he gets a rough and tumble education wh. gives a certain piquancy to his talk and company . There 's beautiful affection in this country , immense tenderness , romantic personal enthusiasm , and a general kindliness and serviceableness and good nature , wh. is very pleasant and curious to witness for us folks at home who are mostly ashamed of our best emotions , and turn on our heel with a laugh sometimes when we are most pleased and touched . If a man falls into a difficulty a score of men are ready to help . The Editor of a newspaper in this little city with MOM whites and as many negroes was shot in a. duel ? the city subscribed ? ? 200 a year for his orphans . Meagher told me yesterday ( a fine fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome , immensely in earnest and at war with the priests ) that there came a girl to Washington from New York bound to Louisiana . She asked leave to sleep on 538 1IAR PER 'S MONT I I I , Y MAGAZINE board the boat at Washington , the Captain took her to his own house , gave her in charge to the Conductor of the Railway at Amnia Creek , who saw her through the journey to Richmond , and ran off instantly thence to get her a carriage and see her luggage packed and herself forwarded to the Southern Station . And the Queen being abused by an Englishman at New York , who should be her champion but this Meagher the rebel ? ( this is par parenthese ) . Three as fine Irishmen as ever met were he and Dillon and O'Gorman , refugees and flourishing lawyers at New York now . I tell yon it 's grand country entirely . The young blood heating in its pulses warms one , like the company of young men in England . I do n't know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were 10 years younger I might sneer to he sure and satirise Jordan because it . was n't like Ahanah and Pharphar , rivers of Damascus . As a refuge for men who ca n't make their way at home , it 's a great place . What a country where a labouring man begins with earning a dollar a day . An Irishman dictating a letter home to his friends in Ireland out of Maryland , bade his Master write , " My dear Phil , Me Masther is the best of Masthers , and I ayt mayt three toimes a week " ? " Three times a week " says the Master ? " you eat it three times a day you rogue , and 6 times if you like ! " " Hush Master ! " says Paddy ? " Sure they would n't believe me if I said more than 3 times a week ! " Think of country laborers in England and 10 children and 10 shillings a week ! and to be sure let us set to and bemoan the blacks afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these niggers is quite a curiosity to witness . The little niggers are trotting and grinning about the streets , the women are fat and in good case , I wish you could see that waiter at our hotel with 5 gold medals in his shirt ' 2 gold chains and a gold ring . The African Church on a Sunday I amtold is a perfect blaze of pea-green , crimson , ear-rings , lace collars , satin and velvet which the poor darkies wear . I do n't mean to say that Slavery is right but that if you want to move your bowels with compassion for human unhappiness , that sort of aperient is to be found in such plenty at . home , that it 's a wonder people wo n't seek it there . I do n't think it 's of long duration though ? unless perhaps in the cotton-growing countries where the whites ca n't live and the negroes can . Every person I have talked to here about it deplores it and owns that it 's the most costly domestic machinery ever devised . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants whom we can send about their business too when they get ill and past work like true philanthropists as we are ) there must be a dozen blacks here and the work not well done . The hire of a house slave from his owner is 120 dollars ? . E25 ? besides of course his keep , clothing , etc . When he is old he must be kept well and kindly and is ? the little niggers wait upon the old effete niggers . The slave-servants working in the tobacco manufactories can lay up 100 dollars a year . The rule is kindness , the exception no doubt may be cruelty . The great plenty in this country ensures everyone enough to eat ? and the people here entreat me to go on a plantation , to go about by myself , ask questions how and where I like and see if the black people are happy or not . This to he sure leaves the great question untouched that Slavery is wrong . But if you could decree the Abolition tomorrow , by the Lord it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wh . Fate ever vet sent him . Of course we feel the cruelty of flogging and enslaving a negro ? of course they feel here the cruelty of starving an English laborer or of driving an English child to a mine ? Brother , Brother we are kin . I am doing very well with the lectures ? the 2 Presidents came at Washington ? I 've saved some money ? 2,000 in this country and shall probably make half as much more : but 0 how sick I am of the business ! ? I bid you a shake of the hand and am yours always , dear Fonblanque , W. M. THACKERAY . To Mrs. Frederick Elliot November 27 , ( 18,55 ) 0 you kind friend who ask rue for nice long letters , you little know how difficult it is to write ' ern ! Three days ago to Anny I began and wrote 10 lines never 10 minutes leisure have I had since ? the room is never clear of visitors . I have been lecturing every night except 2 in the week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fun . Four attacks this month ; and yet mussifully I have never missed a lecture ? only a dinner or a breakfast or two wh. would be more pleasant than shuddering in bed but wh . I do n't care for losing . What a comfort it was to me to get your letter on Sunday , Mrs. J. E.* ? and to hear your voices again after this long silence . I have been away for 2 days to Troy on the Udson River and staid with some kind people , English and of the H. droppers too , but very good and hearty , at a pretty country house between Troy and Albany ? preached to a multitude at the former place , pocketted 200 dollars , agreed to go back again day after Christmas spending the Anniversary with my English friends , and think that country the prettiest I have seen in the States . The river is like unto a certain Rhine we saw together , Albany is a fair old city with some houses 100 years old . Troy very picturesque , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey in the stifling cars where your feet freeze whilst your head throbs with heat . What very very small beer is this I am letting run ! This gay world of New York I have not seen . I am not a man , I 'm a lecturer this time . I see 3 days in the rhymes and I do n't know what more repetitions , but is n't friendship only a continuation of repetitions ? and do n't we go and see each other though we have no news ? You must know I came home from visits wh . I must pay thinking I was going to have a chill , and have been toasting at the fire and written myself out of it . Let go out again on the tramp and come back at night after the lecture please , God , and write the girls their letter for tomorrow 's steamer . Wednesday 28 . Bon jour Mesdames Adieu Mesdames . To Mrs. Frederick Elliot Buffalo , Dec. 28 ( 1856 ) New York , New Earsday A friend who takes charge of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for me ? most looking like business letters ? one t hate Perry , Airs . Elliot 's sister . in a female hand wh. he daresays I should like -- I wonder whether the female letter is from Chesham Place , London ? I should like it to be from there . What have I been doing since I wrote to it last ? ? having a very good time at Boston . The Bostonians much better pleased and of course far better judges than at New York . At Buffalo they came 2 nights running , 3,000 of them ! They are really surprizingly almost touchingly friendly . Prescott gave me his book ? but Ticknor , whose book no one reads , is a cleverer man than Prescott . Both have comfortable old houses , handsome large libraries and famous Burgundy and Claret in their cellars . So has Longfellow at Cambridge , who lives in . a noble old house whilom occupied by Washington . I have fallen in love with Bayard Taylor . He was a poor boy almost without shoes 10 years ago , since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , Nubia , China , Japan , buried a wife whom he married in the last stage of consumption ? made 6000E by his books and lectures ? is coming to London in Spring and is one of the most interesting men I have ever seen in my life . Lord , you should have seen the theatres full of people coining to hear yours truly ! Providence is as jolly a place as Boston almost . ' There is always a knot of pleasant folks fogeyfied respectable fond of literature with whom it is jolly to consort , and I shall remember Lawyer Ames and a nice old University Library and a half-dozen fellows with kindness always . From Boston I came 100 miles through a sweet country wondrously peopled to Greenfield such a nice vil-lage ? with such a good fellow for my host there , Hon. G. T. Davis , a man you 'd all delight in . And the people flocked through the snow and absolutely peopled the railway ears to hear the lecture . Bon Dieu , what do they mean ? It was Xmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine I drank it to friends at home . T wonder whom I thought of besides my children ? Can you guess ? All Xmas Day travelled to Albany and drove to Mr. Dunlop 's house where was the kyindest welcome and quiet , and a jolly little sleigh drive next morning through a fairyland of frozen land , river and city-scape where all the trees were glistening with silver , and all the houses iced with plum-cake snow , and so , on the 27th. from Albany I came on to Buffalo wh . I reached at midnight and to-day I have been sleighing about the grim looking place and seen the darkling lake and a bow shot across Niagara river , the black firs and glittering white houses in Canada . But I must n't write any more of this letter but keep it for next mail . Next year I am to begin at Philadelphia and then who knows whither T go ? to New Orleans perhaps ? but wherever I am you know there 's always an electric telegraph between me and Cheshogan Place . New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear friends says somebody who thinks about them a great deal . What a blessing to be able to come 500 miles through the driving snow ? warm , snug I was going to say , comfortable and I shd. have been but for an Irishman who sate next me and had a cold and used his fingers as we use a pocket handkerchief . eo years ago that journey wd . have taken a fortnight . Ought n't I for one to be thankful for railroads who Dever could have made all these dollars without ' em ? Are n't you bored by my perpetual talk about dollars ? Last night e hours after my arrival we had a fire in the hotel . Did n't I dash at my desk and sermons ? It burned in a cellar but luckily the hour was early , the injines quickly on the spot ? sermons , preacher , portmanteaux all were perfectly safe ? and I went to sleep so sleepy that I guess I forgot even that little prayer which is said upon my pillow most nights . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 24-26 ( 1856 ) I did not write to you from New Orleans , but a pleasanter thing I heard from mrs bonnes soeurs . I am just off the Thomas Small Steamer . Do n't you see how my hand trembles ? The boat in her passage up the river throbbed and trembled so that I thought she would shake her cranky sides off her ribs . And the river or the trembling of the boat gave me a fit of my old chill and fever which served pour passer le temps and occupied one day out of the 5 . " Look there , Sir ! " says a cheerful friend of mine on the Levee at N. 0 . as we looked at a hundred enormous steamers moored there ? " There , at the white mansion do you see ? That post was knocked out by a piece of the boiler of the John Jones which burst here , Sir ? here on this spot where we are standing ? and the heads and mangled limbs of the people were scattered and a mule , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dray , and I saw it lying where you stand now ! " The morning I came away I read that a ferry steamer had taken fire on the Delaware and 25 persons were killed , that the Alabama steamer on the Red River had bursted her boiler and afterwards taken fire , the number of the killed not Down ? pleasant was n't it ? for a man just setting out on the river journey ? but it 's over and we did n't blow up and we only took fire twice and burned down our upper cook house and 2 hours ago I was quite sorry to leave the T. Small . She was very clean and the servants civil and I had 11Iarryat 's novels which kept me in amusement through Alabama and Mississippi too . He is a vulgar dog but he makes me laugh and very few can now . Certainly not yours truly the author of V. F. Where do you think this is written from ? ? the place they say that was Martin Chuzzlewit 's Eden , Cairo . at the confluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned place ! but it will be a great city in 6 years spite of overflows and fever and ague . Twelve hours tonight D. V. will take me to St. Louis and then I shall feel as if I am on my road home again to see my children and my bonnes socurs : Why need I go on making a quack of myself any more ? But if when I come home ? after speaking of Queen Vic , in the very handsomest manner , after making thousands of folks that hated him feel kindly for old George , I am attacked for speaking my mind about George IV ( mind I left out the Q. Caroline scandal entirely ) ? by Jupiter ! ? It will do me good . I want a fight , I have always told you I can hit harder than any man alive , and I never do ? but o ! I think a little exercise would do me good ? In fine I want to get home more and more every day . To do what ? to dawdle about Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ? But I want to kiss my dear children and see my bonnes soevrs and speak to people whom I can speak to . Two months more of the treteaux and may n't we hope for these things ? Yes if winds and waves and Heaven permit . I wonder after being how many whole weeks in London I shall want to be on the move again ? God bless you . I keep this little piece for tomorrow and this is the 4th of March and is n't tomorrow my lady 's day ? 0 me ! I could n't finish the rhyme ? have n't I had ten visitors ? And is n't it post time ? and must n't I put up with a kind kind greeting to vies bonnes soeurs . To His Daughters Mobile , Alabama , 1856 . A welcome letter of Feb. 1 reaches me on the 29th after such a dreary weary half dozen journeys from Savannah ? to Macon 10 hours 200 miles through pine Hats-3 days there and only 170 dollars for my trouble ? to Columbus 100 miles in 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hours , and 100 miles , more pine flats , and from Montgomery down the Alabama River to this place ? where I have got into such a nice hotel , into such a beautiful room , have had such a comfortable warm bath and read over a clean breakfast such a comfortable letter from my women . I think sometimes of writing descriptive letters with remarks on the scenery and illustrations ? but I have not the face for that kind of conversation with my Family . The dreariness of this country , 6rerywhere , almost consumes me ? there is nothing to draw ? one sketch I made on the river yesterday ? o what a dismal scene ! This is what you see day after day ? but the stink and the dirt the foul glasses , the dingy shirts ( many of them with grand diamond brooches making a sunshine in those shady places ) the peeps of flannel the hands and nails ? o my who is to draw those ? On board the boat a gentleman asked me to drink.at night . We go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I offer him . a drink ? " Nossir I have dined Sir ? we do n't drink after dinner Sir ! " Before breakfast there was a fine groggy smell about the bar though . What I shall never understand is how there were no bugs on board . As a favour I got a basin and towel for myself ? other gentlemen fixed themselves in the barber 's shop . This is far too pretty a view of the country for a thousand miles . The trees are not so tall nor can one give the ragged air wh. pervades everything by any scrabble of this pen . Well , I am glad the journey is over so far . To me it is beyond measure stupefying and depressing . In the midst of it though I heard people talking about longing to get home and when they did get home 0 anon Dieu ! It was a swampy sandflat of .100 wooden houses 4 churches and a hotel and a newspaper office ? where they skipped out quite pleased to he back at this Elysium . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Xtian place anyhow . We have beautiful weather in the steamer , and a volume of Marryat 's collected novels kept me quite amused . I might as well have seen Havannah though ? This trip will not make us 100 . E the richer , MO ? no scarce 50 . Never mind I did for the best . How can I help it that it 's pouring with rain so that hundreds will be kept away from hearing me tonight ? Sunday . Another famous letter from my gals and their Granny . But when will this one reach them ? Why , it ca n't leave Boston for 10 days to come . And though I 've cautioned Granny yet I know she 'll go for to frighten herself . I am very well here ; and as for money , how much do you think we cleared by our lecture of last night ? no less a sum than three dollars . The night was awful that is the truth , the rain was making such a row on the roof of the hall that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible the roar of the storm ? I wonder that 120 people were to be found to venture out on such a night ? The hall cost , , 50 dollars that was 100 of ' em ? the advertisements 5 dollars , 10 people more ? the door keeper 2 dollars ? remain 3 dollars for me , Charles and my family . But what must it be when 50 poor devils are dependent upon a theatre , and nobody comes ; and they want money for their dinners and breakfasts ? Afraid I sha n't get those other 9000 dollars I want . Well , we must he longer getting them that 's all . Have been to church and heard a good sermon ? saw the parson at my sermon last night . March 4 . The boat for New Orleans sails in an hour and I pop my little letter into the post beforehand . Have I said that I have had famous good health here ? better spirits and appetite than I 've had since I 've been in the States . Last night was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same at N. 0 . where at any rate I shall have 10 jolly days and then for the West and then for my old friends of Boston Philadelphia New York and then for some olden friends yet-0 how welcome the end of May will be and the sight of Liverpod steeples . God bless my women and rn:e dearest old Mother &; G. P. ? and Ails : Anny I insist on your having some money ? and that 's a famous letter about the Cricket on the Hearth and I am my dearest Children 's loving father always .
