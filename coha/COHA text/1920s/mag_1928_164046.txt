DELUGE-Sydney Fowler Wright-Cosmopolitan Book Corporation ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Story . Land trembled and sank , winds roared , and the waters rose . India was no more , China a forgotten dream , Southern Europe gone , Germany a desolation below the sea , England too-but for a bit of midlands which persisted as a group of islands . Some few inhabitants had not fled mistakenly North : Martin , separated by the floods from wife and children ; Claire , " like a valkyrie " ; and a handful of miners , laborers , vagabonds , with too few women to go ' round . <P> Claire , once almost a channel swimmer , turns up on one of the smaller islands , but chafes under the obvious intentions of its two male citizens , and dives off in the wake of departing seagulls , just as a renewed upheaval submerges the island anyway . An overnight 's swim brings her to company less aggressive but very dull , so after a few weeks ' rest she swims off again-in search of a mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is quickly adapting himself to the laws of nature-storing up loot for the winter , beating off dogs that have already turned wolflike , and finally battling with brutish fellows for the possession of his woman . <P> Follows matter enough for a dozen penny dreadfuls , threepenny thrillers : a fight with sledgehammer and dirk in the lurid shadows of a gypsy fire-Claire 's body gleaming white but for the dark cords that bind her ankles and wrists ; a struggle in the dank blackness of a railway tunnel which a gang of Claire 's suitors blockade at one end , while others sneak in opposite : " Kill the man , but save the wench ! . . . " A relic of civilized scruple holds Martin from killing a hairy giant furnaceman , because he has sprawled over the tracks and technically is down . But Claire sees the prostrate giant heave a rock , and , with no scruples , jabs him , hacks , thwacks , kills , saving Martin 's life . <P> In the nick of slaughter Martin and Claire are rescued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out to have been sent by Martin 's antediluvial wife , Helen , whom he had thought drowned . Before her presence can soil the lovers ' passion , however , Helen is kidnaped by a fresh band of lustful and flood-maddened males . <P> Martin and Claire , faced by the challenge of Helen 's kidnaping , sink their own love in a wild , valorous ride to rescue her . Helen 's abductor is shot by Claire , who realizes in the heat of killing that she can not take Martin from his wife of " wildrose beauty . " <P> One supposes that Claire will have to content herself with one of the numerous flood-created bachelors who stalk woman-hungry through the book ; but the last page of this palpitating yarn brings a grand climax that sends the reader 's imagination reeling off upon further and seemingly inevitable crises and conflicts .
