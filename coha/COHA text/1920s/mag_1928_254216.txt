From London 's smart Mayfair to Scotland 's dour Hebrides , every Britishman knows that the only thing which keeps him reasonably warm is the Gulf Stream . Alarming , therefore , was a report last week by two White Star Line skippers that , according to their observations , the Gulf Stream has recently changed its course ten points . Should it swerve away from the British Isles entirely , they would become semi-Arctic . Stern old duchesses and gouty earls would have to flee , pellmell , with cockneys and Irishmen before a new Ice Age . Cold England would have to be abandoned , and Britishmen would seek refuge in their Dominions . <P> Fortunately the White Star Line score was immediately countered by its rival , the Cunard Line , one of whose skippers was quick to curry popular favor by declaring that his observations showed nothing wrong with the Gulf Stream . Finally the North-German Lloyd 's Commodore , Herr Johnsen , scathingly observed that of course the observations of such fast ships as to the currents they were cutting through must naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all smart sea captains make a practice of announcing or denying the occurrence of sea marvels-such as " worst storms , " " first whales of the season " or " largest icebergs " - with intent to cause the names of their ships to appear in public prints . Indulgent pressmen did not mind printing the ships which went a-Gulf-Streaming last week : Homeric &; Majestic , Mauretania and Columbus . <P> Oceanology . The hottest part of the Atlantic Ocean runs about 350 miles ( 5 ) north of the Equator , from Africa to South America . Carribbean waters are just as warm ( 80 F. ) . Almost as warm , and much higher in level than the open ocean is the Gulf of Mexico . The combination of Gulf temperature and level with the West Indies volcanic action and the twirling of the Earth sets a current of warm water running north along the American coast to Newfoundland-the Gulf Stream . A wall of cold water separates the Gulf Stream from the North American continent . <P> Off Newfoundland the Gulf Stream meets the Labrador Stream coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Grand Banks . <P> The Gulf Stream , swiftest moving and best studied of ocean currents , however , loses comparatively little of its heat at Newfoundland . It drifts eastward to help warm all of Europe , including of course England. * Europe is warmer than North America . Off Europe the Gulf Stream Drift splits into three streams . One goes between the Faeroe and Shetland Islands north of Scotland , another along west Iceland , the third along the western side of Greenland . <P> Occasionally temporary branches of the Gulf Stream have been noted . Perhaps the steamship captains , reporting a reversal of the Stream last week , had ignorantly floundered through some such stray stream . <P> But a more recondite reason is possible . Tides , lunar and solar , of course influence ocean currents . When sun and moon act together their pull gives the entire ocean flow a mighty wrench and affects the climate of bordering land .
