txt The Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor has aligned itself with the advocates of light wines and beer , and has called upon all members of the Federation and other citizens to demand of their Senators and Congressmen that the Volstead act be amended accordingly . A formal declaration of the position taken by the Federation and adopted by the council was issued today . It Contends that the present law is being disregarded and that it can not be enforced . The declaration is addressed to the American people . It reads : " - The American Federation of Labor , as spokesman of the unorganized as well as the organized toilers , having In mind the interest and the welfare of ? Ur people , decided by unanimous vote in its convention held in Denver in June , 1921 , that the Volstead enforcement act must be modified so as to permit the manufacture and sale of beer and light wines . " Before this decision was reached the Executive Council of the A. F. of L. had caused to be made an exhaustive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shown by this investigation that there had bet n : " 1 . A general disregard of the law among all classes of people , including those who made the law . " 2 . Creation of thousands of moonshiners among both country and city dwellers . . " 3 . The creation of an army of bootleggers ; " 1 . An amazing increase In the traffic in poisons and deadly concoctions and drugs . " 5 . An increased rate of * insanity , blindness and crime among the users of these concoctions and drugs . " 6 . Increase in unemployment due to I loss of employement by workers in fortyfive industries directly or indirectly connected with the manufacture of liquors. " 7 . Increase in taxes ? to city , State and national Governments amounting to approximately $1,000,000,000 per year . " Having in mind these results of the extreme interpretation of the prohibition amendment contained in the Volstead act , as well as the enormous expense of the attempt to enforce that unenforceable legislation , it Is our conclusion that . the act is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social and a moral ; failure , and that it is a dangerous breeder of discontent and of contempt for all law . " Something of the economic effect of the Volstead law may be seen by considering the fact that in 1918 , according to Government statistics , $110,000 , - 000 worth of farm products were consumed by breweries , and that the transportation of these products to the manufacturer and thence to the consumer necessitated the use of 133,666 railroad cars . In addition to this , breweries in operation in 1918. consumed 60,000 carloads of coal . It must be obvious that the total economic effect of the destruction of this industry is tremendous . ' Advocates Law and Order . ' " The American Federation of Labor always has been the advocate of law and order and always has endeavored to create conditions which would make possible the highest type of citizenship . " We do not protest against the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution , which now is a part of the fundamental law of the land . We do not protest against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention . that the Eighteenth Amendment , under a reasonable and proper legislative interpretation , would be beneficial to our country and would have the support of the great majority of our people . " The Eighteenth Amendment , however , under the present drastic and unreasonable legislative interpretation has a destructive and deteriorating effect and influence in every direction . We seek no violation of the Eighteenth Amendment , but on the contrary we declare for a reasonable interpretation of the . amendment in order that the law may be enforceable and enforced , and in order that the people of our country may not suffer from an unjust and fanatical interpretation of the Constitution . " We urge , therefore , that all citizens in every walk of life demand from their representtives and Senators in Washington immediate relief from the unwarranted restriction contained in the Volstead act ; and we likewise suggest to the citizenship of our country the wisdom and advisability of bearing in mind the attitude toward this issue of officeholders and aspirants to office in coining elections in order that there may he restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines , which , under the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment , can and should be rightfully declared WI non-intoxicating beverages.
