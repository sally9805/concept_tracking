txt What would a manufacturer say or think if he sau a workman with arm uplifted about to throw a heavy wrench into the machinery ? That is the situation confronting the country 's business at the present time . Congrest is the workman , and the wrench is found in the Ilaugen bill now before the House of Representatives . In addition to $300,000 for expenses , the bill as finally reported to the House carries an appropriation of $375 , - Cfit , 000 a year for two years to set the plan in operation . Whatever other objections may be found in the bill , this one will have the same effect upon the country 's industrial and financial affairs as a monkey wrench thrown into the gears of a great machine . Look at a few figures taken from official sources . For tht- figesal year ending June 30 , 1925 , the Treasury 's accounts showed a surplus of $230,505,000 , The Treasury experts also calcuated that the surplus for the year ending June 30 , 1926 , would be $262,000,000 and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in tax rates . Business was crying out against the heavy burden of taxation which , among other things , took from it $1,760 , - Ct10,000 in income taxes alone in 1925 . In line with the Presidential program of economy in expenditures Congress began a consideration of the tax law of 192.1 . The present revenue law of 1926 was finally enacted which , experts say , should reduce tax receipts about $350,000,000 a year . Therefore , there will be no surplus . This reduction is about one-fifth the amount actually collected under the former law . Such a reduction promised great relief to the country 's business machine . But now a bill is introduced in Congress which proposes to , add $375,000,0170 a year to the Treasury 's . disbursements . The estimated saving of ** by tax reduction would be swept away with $25,000,000 additional . The last state would be worse than the first . Taxes have been reduced to a point where ordinary receipts and expenditures will safely balance . But slap on an extra appropriation that is 21 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates went into effect , and what will be the result ? It eertainlY must be paid in some way . That fact must be faced . Can anyone tell of a single dollar the Government Illepes to oun that will not come from the pockets of the people ! The Government produces nothing . It does not plow or plant . It reaps , but only through taxation . That appropriation of $375,000,000 a year for two years must come through the same means . The budget has been cut to the bone and taxes have been reduced to correspond with it . With this great apprupriation superimposed upon it , arc we to have a return to the earlier tax rates ? If so , will not the effect be line throwing a monkey wrench in the national machinery ?
