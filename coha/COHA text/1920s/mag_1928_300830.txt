For Nominee Smith , last week , famed chefs prepared a mud pie . <P> One chef was the Rev. John Roach Straton , blatant Manhattan pulpiteer , who characterized Governor Smith , last fortnight , as " the deadliest foe in America today of the forces of moral progress and true political wisdom . " Challenged to debate the charge in his own Calvary Baptist Church ( TIME , Aug. 20 ) , Pulpiteer Straton weasled , tried to shift the scene to local amphitheatres . But Nominee Smith declined to make a public show . He wrote : " The answer to my request to appear in your church before your parishioners ... is yes or no . " Pulpiteer Straton answered : " Emphatically and unchangeably yes . " But he meant " no , " he would not debate in his church . And the incident was closed with a few parting , typically Stratonian epithets : " Bluffer . . . Tammany trickster . . . coward . . . . " <P> Another chef was the wayfaring Editor William Allen White of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , Editor White heard that his " withdrawal " of charges against Nominee Smith had been interpreted as a " retraction . " No retractor , Editor White cabled his fellow Kansan , Henry Justin Allen , national publicity chief for Hooverism : " On the prostitution issue I proved my case , got a conviction and suspended the sentence . I only did this because I felt that a debate on the subject of harlotry was not worthy of a presidential campaign . " <P> To publicitiman Allen , the nonretracting cable about Harlotry did not seem worthy of careful guardianship . The cable was broadcast throughout the land . It was Publicitiman Allen 's turn to weasle : " I showed it to a newspaperman ... in my personal capacity . ... In some unexplained way it went to our publicity deportment . " <P> Tired of concocting , weasling . Nominee Smith suddenly turned on the famed chefs , told them to eat their own mud pie . He issued a lengthy statement . He explained his every vote as a New York Assemblyman on bills connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> Mud Pie : " I denounce as unfair , unmanly and un-American this slanderous attack upon me and my record . I am glad to have this matter taken out of the whispering stage and put into the open . " <P> Prostitution : " Mr. William Allen White sailed for Europe with a happy and contented mind . I hope , and I would not disturb it by attempting to describe to him the heavy weight that he laid upon my family when he accused me of being a friend of prostitution . . . . My record as an opponent of immorality is fixed and secure . Publicly and by many letters in my possession , the late Rev. Canon John P. Peters , when chairman of the Committee of Fourteen , the leading anti-vice society of New York , repeatedly thanked me for my co-operation with that organization . No one in all the 25 years of my public life has ever dared to make the vile suggestions which emanated from Mr. White , with the approval of Henry J.
