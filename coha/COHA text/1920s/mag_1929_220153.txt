The Black Crook . It was on Sept. 12 , 1866 , that The Black Crook entered Niblo 's Garden in New York . Buxom young ladies appeared in tights which revealed not only their ankles but their hips . In those days people believed with Queen Victoria in the theory that women had no understanding whatever . Next day James Gordon Bennett 's New York Herald commended the city to the fire and brimstone of Sodom and Gomorrah . Sunday after Sunday pulpits boomed denunciation . Soon at Niblo 's Garden there was only standing room . <P> Last week in Hoboken , N. J. , their ' ' last seacoast of Bohemia , " Christopher Morley , Cleon Throckmorton , Conrad Milliken and Harry Wagstarf Gribble revived The Black Crook . Next day not a newspaper blushed , no pulpit peeped . Nevertheless , Hoboken 's Lyric Theatre had scarcely more than standing room , not , of course , because The Black Crook is shocking in 1929 , but because it is " quaint . ' ' The only trouble with it is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the audience understands just how funny it looks and sounds after all these years , the actors fall into too-broad burlesque . Moreover , the producers have " sought to modernize the script here and there , and for the Amazons who marched their hourglass figures before the oglers of 1866 , have been substituted some more or less fleshless girls of the 1929 model . <P> For the most part , however , it is great good fun .

Eventually the four leased it and dusted it . <P> Their original intention was merely to use the old playhouse for their own amusement . They gathered together a company best described as semiprofessional and last Labor Day threw the doors open for their first production , a revival of The Barker , a Broadway hit . not caring much whether they even paid expenses . They did n't . Nor did they care . They kept on , producing Mr. Morley 's own play , Pleased to Meet You , reviving Broadway and The Old Soak , going into red ink but having a very pleasant time of it .
