Steamship skippers , like horsemen and motorists sensitive to what they drive , say that a ship you are used to never feels quite the same after she has been handled a while by someone else . In the case of the S. S. Leviathan , the saying would hold specially true for a man who last handled her during the War , when her German name , Vaterlard , had just been erased and before she was remodeled to be the luxurious flagship of the U. S. Lines . <P> Captain Harold A. Cunningham , the Leviathan 's present skipper , is such a man . But when last week , on his very first trip with the Leviathan since the War , his first trip as Commodore of the U. S. Lines , he ran his ship aground on Brambles Bank in Southampton Water , he was too good a sport and too proud a sailor to offer even an old saying for an excuse . <P> It might have happened to anyone . Brambles Bank almost completely blocks the Southampton channel off Cowes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in two hours , when the tide rose . But Commodore Cunningham tugged his cap down over the face that has caused him to be called " Handsome Harry , " in grim mortification . <P> British skippers , haughtiest in the world , who gasped with astonishment when Herbert Hartley was given the Leviathan in 1923 ahead of " Handsome Harry " Cunningham-gasped because Hartley was then jobless after grounding first the Manchuria and then the Mongolia of the American Line , whereas Cunningham was right in line for the post , being skipper of the George Washington-were inclined to mix sympathy with their blame last week . " It was jolly bad work , " said one of them , " but jolly worse luck . On his very first trip , too-tch , tch . Maybe Hartley left his luck on that Leviathan. "
