txt Lord Wester Wemyss , commander of the British fleet in the Dardanelles and later First Sea Lord , urged in the House of Lords today that Great Britain give formal notice to the world of her intention to denounce the Declaration of Paris treaty of 1856 and assert her intention in any future wars to exercise her " ancient historic right , " given up then , to search neutral ships at sea and confiscate merchandise destined for enemy countries . It was a purely academic discussion , one of those brilliant , impotent debates which occasionally hold the floor of the British upper house and afford observers an insight into the empire 's varied viewpoints on all manner of world questions . Earl Stanhope , Civil Lord of the Admiralty , quickly assured Lord Wemyss that it was impossible to withdraw from the seventy-year obligation even if Britain wished to , and he said be doubted the advantage of doing so .

Lord Balfour , winding up the discussion , took occasion to decry Parliamentary criticisms of the failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lent a springboard whence Lord Wemyss dived into wartime naval policy generally . " It is very easy to criticize after the event , " said Lord Balfour . " The ill success which attended the efforts at Geneva suggests , however , that when this subject is again resumed , as I hope it will be , it will be well to learn what we can from the past . " Meanwhile , he said , the subject was too delicate to debate and was calciliated to lead to discord rather than to peace . But the address of Lord Wemyss , a blunt , outspoken expression of expert opinion on naval matters , is recognized here as the true view of the Admiralty apart from the civil side . " Every Englishman knows in a general way that his safety and even the national existence depend entirely cn the navy , " said the Admiral . " but he has the vaguest idea of what the fleet does . Its chief power lies not in guns or torpedoes , but in the immemorial right of all . belligerent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemies ' continued resistance must depend .

It was because Germany 's supplies were able to reach her via neutral countries , he went on , that the German fleee was able to stay in port throughout . the war and the British fleet was unable to reach and destroy it . " The inability of our navy to bring direct pressure on the German fleet was a direct result of the Declaration of Paris , " he added . He argued that the declaration was not a treaty , but merely a declaration of intent never ratified , and there was no reason , legal or moral , why any signatory might not end it .

It would secure Europe to a large degree against the I prolongation and spreading of any military conflagration which broke out . Only one other sentence was sig- ; nificant : " No trader , of whatever nation-ality , but owes a debt to the British fleet for the safety of his ventures at sea . " Lord Stanhope immediately pointed out to Lord Wemyss that he only referred to one clause in the agreement . Part of the declaration prohibited privateering and another ruled that a blockade in order to be obligatory must be effective . Although the United States had never adhered to the Declaration because she did not wish privateering to be illegal , Britain wished it , as also did Germany . A " paper blockade " of the entire British Isles was illegal in wartime because ineffective . He asked what Germany might not have done in raiding with privateers fitted out overseas and provided with letters of marque .

" It was Lord Haldane who recalled the Geneva breakdown , pointedly blaming the Admiralty for " throwing our proposals at the heads of people ' with whom we are dealing . " Lord Balfour poured oil to calm the debate . It was impossible and undesirable to end the Declaration of Paris , he said . His chief criticism of Lord Wemyss 's views was that they underrated the part the British Navy played in the war . " My view is that without the British Navy the war would n't have lasted a year , " he said . The Declaration of Paris was signed at the Congress of Paris in 1856 by the various powers represented there , including France and Great Britain . It contained four article : . as follows : 1 .
