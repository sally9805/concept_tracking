txt A new world conference of the principal powers to effect an arrangement for the restoration of sound financial and business conditions , as well as further limitations on land and sea armament , was proposed today by Senator Borah Rep. , Idaho , in an amendment to the naval appropriation bill . The amendment authorizes and requests the President to call a confer , ence , presumably in Washington , and to issue invitations as he may see fit ' to various governments to participate . The conference would give its atten ! don to a wide range of subjects . including the German reparations question . which Senator Borah described as " the key to the European situation . " Harrison Grows Sarcastic . Senator Harrison Dem. , Miss. , one of the most ardent advocates of the ersailles pact , expressed a common view when he remarked , " After reading Senator Borah 's proposal I fully expect to see President Harding enter , us in the league of nations about one day after tomorrow . " Nevertheless , it was quite generally predicted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill comes up for consideration . Reparations Key to Situation . Senator Borah vigorously repudiated the suggestion that his proposal was at odds with his opposition to the Versailles treaty and the league of nations . " We are traveling , " he said , " In a vicious circle . No business man nor any one else who has reflected upon the situation . dares to look over the next year , if the next year is to be similar to the year which is just passing . It seems to me that there ought to be a heroic effort made , not only to stop this threatened naval race , but also to deal with economic conditions . " The question of reparations Is the key to the European situation . if that can not be adjusted , nothing can be adjusted . It may be possible in a conference of this kind to break the deadlock on that subject . If there is a better program anywhere around 1 should be glad to waive this suggestion .
