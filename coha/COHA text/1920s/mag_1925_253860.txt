THUNDERSTORM-G . B. Stern-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . Mistress of many moods , the author of Debatable Ground and The Matriarch ( Mrs. Geoffrey Holdsworth of England ) well merits the distinction of her pseudonymous initials ( G. B. S. ) Few writers of equal taste can so deftly thread the fine needle of discernment with the wiry fibres of reality . Thunderstorm begins as an idyll-an intelligent young English couple basking beneath the comic benevolence of their Italian servants , emotional ' Vanna and heroic Ettore . Basking with them are semi-permanent guests , a durable male friend , a spirited girl cousin . To the baskers blows a breeze-news of a desirable position for the host in England . A jog is indicated in everyone 's life . Clouds follow the breeze , each basker having a selfish reaction to this jog . Thunderheads follow clouds , each basker lying to himself about his selfish reaction . A storm bursts , with rumblings of anger , shaft of malice , gales of recrimination , deluges of tears . The sun reappears when , for a motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the durable male friend - shoehorns some one else into the host 's desirable London position . As basking is resumed , it is observed that " every quarrel , however trivial , contains all the quarrels that are older than the hills . "
