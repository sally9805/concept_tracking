Only two men have been president of the German Republic . Last fortnight the Post Office announced that their portraits will soon appear respectively on two new stamps . For a likeness of the late Socialist First President Friedrich Ebert ( TIME , March 9 , 1925 ) , jolly , onetime saddlemaker , Germans will pay only eight pfennigs ( 2 ) . But for a stamp portrait of President Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg , national idol , the price will be 15 pfennigs ( 4 ) .
