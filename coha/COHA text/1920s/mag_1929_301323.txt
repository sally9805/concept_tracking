Trustees of Columbia University last week received the annual report of Columbia 's president , Nicholas Murray Butler . Increases in faculty salaries , accomplishments of faculty members , gifts to the University-these and similar academic matters were included in Dr. Butler 's report . More important to Dr. Butler , who is as much the publicist as the pedagog , was a disquisition on the Law , particularly the Law in its lack of majesty . <P> " That part of the social fabric which is called the law , " said he . " needs overhauling . ... It may well be that we shall discover among the mass of statutes , judicial decisions and administrative rulings which now confront us , some that are law , some that are partly law , some that are no law , and some that are antilaw . . . . When conduct and the law are at odds , the fault may lie with the law . . . . " <P> Arguing particularly against the theory that the law is sacred as such . Dr. Butler declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts except in form , save insofar as the general will accepts them . No law which has to do with human thought or speech or conduct can by any possibility be enforced . . . . If it be urged that all statutes . . . that have the form of law have also by reason of that very fact the full force and authority of law , then one can only sigh and repeat softly the immortal words of Mr. Bumble : * ' If the law supposes that , the law is a ass , a idiot . . . and the worst I wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experience . ' " <P> <P> *Mr . Bumble : Character in Dickens ' Oliver Twist . Smug , self-righteous , disagreeable , he is the beadle in the orphan asylum at which Oliver disgraced himself by asking for " more . " It was Mr. Bumble who christened Oliver , as follows : <P> " Notwithstanding the most superlative , and , I may say , supernat'ral exertions on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been able to discover who is his father , or what was his mother 's settlement , name or condition . " <P> Mrs. Mann raised her hands . . . . " How comes he to have any name at all then ? " <P> The beadle drew himself up with great pride , and said , " I invented it . ... We name our foundlings in alphabetical order . The last was a S , - Swubble , I named him . This was a T , - Twist , I named him . The next one as comes will be Unwin and the next Zwilkins. . . . "
