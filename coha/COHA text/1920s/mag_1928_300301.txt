Even pretty women have been cautioned by Roman policemen , during the past two years , whenever they have " kept to the right " in walking alo.ng the Corso Umberto , famed shopping thoroughfare . <P> All pedestrians should have " kept to the left , " by command of Prime Minister Benito Mussolini ; but until last week the order was never enforced . A young or pretty transgressor would experience no more than a gallant pressure upon the arm from a policeman who murmured mellifluently , " Sinistra , Signora . " Usually the pressure and the suggestion were ignored by willful females , stubborn males-until last week . <P> Suddenly and sharply policemen barked , " Sinistra , Signora ! " , " Sinistro , Signore ! " Those who disobeyed were roughly collared and questioned : " Your name , Signora ? Your age ? You must answer , Signora ! Your father 's name ? Your mother 's maiden name ? " <P> On the morning after this sort of thing began , last week , all ' Roman newspapers printed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signore and Signori who had been caught " walking wrong " on the Corso Umberto . Fifty women and men were thus pilloried . On the second day it was necessary to pillory only one woman , nine men . On the third day " walking wrong " had practically ceased . <P> Wags warned : <P> When in Rome walk as the Romans do .
