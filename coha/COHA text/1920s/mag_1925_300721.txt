Laymen who dramatize in their imaginations the great discoveries of science , would find the actual moment of such discoveries dull enough . One more figure added to a string of decimals , a barely perceptible change of color in a test tube , a splinter of light measured against the angle of a graphed mirror-and the thing is done . The laboratory worker wipes his hands on his apron and goes home to write a paper for the next meeting of the National Academy of Sciences . Last week that notable body , convening in Madison , Wis. , listened to various amazing reports . <P> Ray . Dr. Robert Andrews Millikan of the California Institute of Technology told the Academy about a new ray which he had discovered-a ray which begins in eternity . Born beyond space , in some dim interstellar vestibule behind the gates of the discoverable universe , out of a womb still swollen with gas , perhaps with litters of uncreated stars , the Millikan Ray stabs earthward , traversing aerial shambles strewn with the debris of mutating solar systems , planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , and voids in which time , unhinged , spins like a tiny weathervane in an everlasting whirlwind . What bred the ray ? The condensation into matter of light and heat given off by distant stars and suns , * suggests Dr. Millikan . <P> Like the rays of radium , the Millikan Rays , wherever they are present in any quantity , have a sterilizing effect fatal to life . X-rays are absorbed by half an inch of lead . The Millikan Ray will pierce six feet of lead ; it is the product of elements uniting with an energy charge 50 times as great as that evolved by any reaction known to the earth . <P> At one point Dr. Millikan was carrying on his experiments on top of Pike 's Peak with featherweight instruments buoyed in air by small balloons ; at another time he probed 60 feet deep in a snow-fed lake under the brow of Mount Whitney . Since it would take 10,000,000 volts to reproduce the ray artificially , Dr. Millikan points out that there is little likelihood of his discovery being utilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Drug . Sufferers from paresis resulting from syphilitic infection may be cured , said Professor A. S. Loevenhart of the University of Wisconsin . Using tryparsamide ( an arsenical drug first compounded by the workers of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research and found to be effective in curing sleeping sickness ) , he restored to their right minds one-third of all the grey-faced , twitching paresis victims upon whom he experimented . <P> Bacteriophage . Dr. Philip Hadley of the University of Michigan told how he had found in sewage a poison that kills poisons-a bacteriophage , eater of germs . Just as the human body , when fatigued , creates protective white blood-corpuscles to fight off germs , so the veins of the earth , its rivers , tributaries , flowing streams , manufacture this mysterious prophylactic only when they are fouled . Dr. Hadley took it from the sewage-filled water of the Huron River , and declares that it can be procured from the sewage of any large city . It not only purifies the water but it may be used to treat such diseases as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
