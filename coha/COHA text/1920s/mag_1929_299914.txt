On May 15 , Automotive Daily News , automobile trade paper , published a story concerning an alleged new Reo eight .

The Record . Rich and social is Edward Beale McLean , publisher of the Washington Post , famed as owner of the Hope diamond , and as a friend of the late President Warren Gamaliel Harding ( TIME , March 10 , 1924 ) . Last week he sued the Philadelphia Record , a Democratic daily , for one million dollars damages on account of libel which Plaintiff McLean described in his declaration as " false , wicked , malicious , scandalous and defamatory . " This he did because , said he , the Philadelphia Record did wickedly contrive and falsely and maliciously intend to bring him ( McLean ) into public disrepute and " to cause it to be suspected and believed that he attended a dinner at the Belgian Embassy in a disgraceful and drunken condition and that at such a dinner he had annoyed and shocked guests of the Belgian Ambassador and that the Belgian Ambassador was perplexed and ordered the plaintiff to leave in order to save his other guests from further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the plaintiff did not attend a dinner at the Belgian Embassy referred to in the article hereinafter complained of and did not at such a dinner dine ' too well ' and did not annoy any guests at such dinner nor shock said guests and did not subject the Belgian Ambassador to embarrassment by reason of his conduct and was not requested to leave such dinner .

What moved Friend of Belgium Herbert Hoover to ask the Prince de Ligne to a small dinner as a special mark of esteem ? Publisher McLean said he did not . And that being so , President Hoover 's courtesy to the Prince was not , said Plaintiff McLean , a " squelching " of Publisher McLean-as the Philadelphia Record had said it was .
