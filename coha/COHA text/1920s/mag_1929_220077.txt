Soon Britons will ballot in their General Parliamentary Election the ultimate question of which is : " Who will head ' the next administration as Prime Minister ? " Though ballots will not be cast for two or three months yet-depending on the date when His Majesty declares the present Parliament dissolved-there were last week important election developments : <P> Apple-Cheeked Gwilym . Since all is fair in love and politics , Conservatives baited their hook to catch workpeople 's votes by popping into one of the Party 's showiest offices an apple-cheeked ex-coal-miner , one Gwilym Rowlands , an oldster as pink and enticing as an angler 's worm . <P> " I am the first wage earner to occupy the post of Chairman of the Conservative Council , " boasted " Old Gwilym " afterwards . " And I consider this fact an indication of the democratic tendency of the Conservative Party nowadays . <P> The 700 delegates of the Conservative Party Congress who had unanimously chosen Worm Rowlands as " Chairman , " next chose as a " Vice Chairman " the world 's biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooming " Old Gwilym " for years in his role of bait , have twice tried and failed to get him elected to Parliament from a worker constituency , are trying again . In 1927 he championed with jovial humbuggery the Trade Dispute 's Act-probably the most tyrannical piece of legislation ever passed in England to squelch strikes . <P> Dance of Death . " Beware the Socialists ! " was the gist of a rousing campaign speech which Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin exhaled into the sooty air of Manchester . As usual , Squire Baldwin , benign scion of an old iron-mongering family , seemed comfortably content with himself and the world . <P> Jammed and squashed into nine large halls , some 30,000 workpeople heard the Prime Minister 's husky voice , mostly from the lipless mouths of loud speakers . <P> " The Socialists ! " warned Mr. Baldwin-and by these he meant the leaders of Britain 's second largest party ( Laborite ) - " The Socialists with their program of nationalize major industries would stifle the spirit of British enterprise . They would reduce our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marionettes dancing to the dictation of officials-a dance of death so far as progress in our nation is concerned . They would make a bureaucratic machine and drive out of this country men of enterprise in whatever class they might be , who would go to the United States or the Dominions , where enterprise and work by the individual are valued and wanted . " <P> Leave it to the Horse ! David Lloyd George laid down the platform of his Liberal party in a " Victory Speech " to the 500 Parliamentary candidates in whom he pins his slender hopes for a comeback to Power . <P> Cocky as always , the little Welsh David chose to speak on St. David 's Day , in a hall decked with crisp Welsh jonquils . " Stanley Baldwin reminds me , " he chirped , " of a driver who finds his cart stuck in a rut and sits there smoking his pipe , saying ' Leave it to the horse ' . . . .                @ @ @ @ @
