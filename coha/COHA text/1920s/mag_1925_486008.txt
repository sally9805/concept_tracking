P RESIDENT COOLIDGE and Secretary Mellon are very proud of the tax reductions they have already accomplished and are now about to carry further with the aid of Congress . The President ascribes them in considerable degree to the budget system . " Without it , " he says , " all the claim of economy would be a mere pretense . " He cites the reduction of the departmental estimates for ordinary purposes  --  from $4,068,000,000 in 1922 to $3,156,000,000 for 1927 ? as the best possible proof of the value of the budget and of the Controller General . That the control of the budget has accomplished much good and that its establishment has been a long step toward scientific control of our national finances no one will , we think , deny . But while the machinery of budget-making may be all that is desired , the question must still be raised , as with every other governmental device , whether those who are operating it are doing so wisely and to the public interest . Neither a reduction of taxes nor of the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings are made . Take the example of Belgium . American financiers have just compelled a cut of $350,000,000 in the budget of that country as the price of advancing funds to stabilize the Belgian currency . Is the cut made in the cost of the useless army which could successfully defend Belgium against no adjacent Power , save possibly Holland ? Not at all . The outcry in Belgium against the United States which has arisen since the facts became known and have been officially admitted by M. Vandervelde is reported to be in large measure due to the cutting of the appropriations for important social and cultural purposes . Belgium naturally resists any outside interference with her budget . She has a right to feel keenly , after all her experiences and hardships since 1914 , that if some of the most important social services of the country are to be sacrificed to such an extent this particular budget-saving becomes not a blessing but an evil. , the responsibility for which must be shared both by the Belgian Cabinet and the American financiers . Similarly it is of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cuts are made in the right place and whether the taxes to be remitted are the proper ones . A perusal of the President 's budget messages and of Secretary Mellon 's statements leaves us still unconvinced on more than one point . Thus the saving in taxes is to be only $336,000,000 , less than 10 per cent of the amount to be raised in the coming fiscal year . Now , to maintain that the lopping off of $336,000,000 is necessary , as the President suggests , on the theory that undue taxation is confiscation of private property , seems to us absurd . So does the hoary old Mellon contention that if our high taxation is not reduced there will not be sufficient money available for new financing or for new business enterprises . The ridiculocis , ness of that view is evident if we but consider the d4ily . export of American capital to Europe and the willingness of the lenders to export a good deal more if Mr. Mellon were not using his control of private loans to compel debt adjustments  --  as he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being put into building enterprises . Thus , during the month of November , building and engineering contracts awarded in the thirty-six Eastern States amounted to $464,683,100 , the highest recorded figure for any November and 23 per cent greater than the figure for November of last year . In New York and northern New Jersey alone the amount so invested rose to $160,629,500 . In the light of these figures anyone who maintains that it was necessary to cut $336,000,000 from the tax levy to keep business from being hamstrung ' through lack of capital is seeking to throw dust in people 's eyes . The cut may be defended on other grounds  --  that too large surpluses make for waste and extravagance or that the individual burden of the small taxpayer is thereby reduced . But it can not be truthfully alleged , as both Mr. Coolidge and Mr. Mellon have said , that it is necessary to make these cuts in order to keep business going and earning enough surplus so that new enterprises may be founded and old ones expanded . Let anyone read the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street and he will be convinced . It must be noted , too , that this cut in taxes is made with little reference to the budget figures . The President has asked for appropriations for total expenditures for the fiscal year 1926-27 of $3,494,222,308.44 . If that budget should be adhered to it would mean a cutting of government expenditures by $124,452,691 . As a matter of fact , the budget for 1925-1926 called for only $3,267,551,000 , but extraordinary or unforeseen expenditures will , it is now estimated , compel the government to disburse $3,618,675,000 by July first next ? a little difference of $351,124,000 between the guess and the fulfilment . Contrasting , therefore , the original estimate for 1925-1926 and the proposed budget for 1926-1927 of this great administration of economy , it appears that so far from being a reduction the new budget is actually an increase over the old of $226,671,308.40 . Doubtless the public will continue to believe that Mr. Coolidge is economizing . As a matter of fact , if he really wishes to economize , he could not only keep this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could reduce it still further . After solemnly assuring the American Legion that no army or navy protects a country from- attack , and in the face of the coming disarmament conference , he has allotted an additional $20,000,000 to the navy while cutting the army by $4,124,000 . The Veterans ' Bureau is to receive $53,000,000 more and the pension roll goes up $8,000,000 . These are necessary expenditures and merely the forerunners of still vaster ones to come . Others are waste . The thoroughly uncivilized character of the budget , as well as the cost of wars , past and future , appears from the figures accompanying the budget compiled by the Budget Bureau itself . From this it appears that the general functions of government receive only 3.35 cents out of every dollar spent by the government , whereas 16.32 cents go to the national defense and 16.55 cents go to military pensions , retirement pay , and other expenditures growing out of past wars . Only 5.60 cents is spent upon public works and 7.40 cents on other civil functions . For our costly mercantile fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts we spend 14.76 , and for the interest on our public debts 22.75 cents . The government thus admits that out of every dollar 70.38 cents goes to wars past and present . France 's Danger the many persons in this country who rightly look upon France as the leader of Latin civilization , and a center from which during most of the modern era intelligence , liberty , and sanity have been diffused into the world , the present plight of the republic is distressing . When Louis Loucheur became Minister of Finance our journals were sure that he would find a way out of the swamp of debt . Now they have forgotten those rosy predictions but are equally sure of Paul Doumer , the new financial head , and are acclaiming the proposal of the industrialists of northern France to mortgage their properties in return for an American loan of 10,000,000,000 francs . That and a proposal to lease the government tobacco monopoly to American interests are the only financial suggestions of any importance which the Doumer ministry has brought forth . Both suggestions are inadequate financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money but it is a trifle beside the 300,000,000,000 francs which France owes or even the 75,000,000,000 francs of this amount which is in short-term securities and is causing most of the immediate embarrassment . Even if such a loan were larger , it could afford only temporary respite financially while it would certainly put the control of the government into the hands of the business men who guaranteed the money , with added pressure from the American bankers who ? supplied the cash . Sale of the tobacco monopoly would be equally objectionable . It might net some actual cash over and above what the government is now making but it would put a big national resource and hundreds of employees under direct foreign control . We repeat what we have said before that France 's only hope of solvency is to raise money within  --  probably through some form of a levy- on capital . To seek loans in America is merely to inflate further her gigantic debt , to put her head in the noose of Wall Street , to pave the way for another Dawes Plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political dangers to republicanism increase . The very fact that the proposal of the northern industrial interests was discussed seriously in France  --  although it seems now to be discredited  --  shows how susceptible the country is to plans which would subordinate Parliament to a super-government by a special clique . In order to make way for fascism it is first necessary to discredit representative government with the public , and a campaign in this direction is already on . An influential section of the Paris press is bitterly assailing Parliament , especially the Chamber of Deputies  --  the democratic branch . The Paris correspondent of the New York Times echoes this when he refers in a dispatch printed on December 19 to " that national menagerie known as the French Chamber , " and he suggests how painlessly a coup d'etat might be effected when he continues calmly : " However , if the worse comes to the worst , President Doumergue is a gentleman who would dissolve the Chamber , with the consent of the Senate , which , if he and Briand and Poincare decided was best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamber could be kept so by the simple . expedient of continually postponing a new election . France is indeed in danger.Mass Opinion at Work W E are witnessing an extraordinarily interesting spectacle in the massing of public opinion at Washington on behalf of American entry into the World Court . Hordes of women have descended upon the galleries of the Senate and are listening with intense eagerness to the debates upon this proposal . They are Democratic women and Republican women and independent women . Some have come of their own initiative , but the bulk of them are there as representatives of organizations committed to our joining the Court . In the main this demonstration is the result of most intensive public propaganda by societies such as the American Foundation of Mr. Bok and various other organizations for putting us into the League of Nations as well as the World Court . The outcome is going to throw a good deal of light upon whether we are going to be ruled henceforth by skilfully organized and directed intellectual groups fired by enthusiasm for a given cause , as prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragooning of legislators by enthusiasts for that cause . Let us say at once that we have heard nothing to make us believe what some Senators seem to ? suspect  --  that there has been improper use of money . So far as we are aware the proponents and opponents of this legislation are entirely within their historic rights . There have been many similar efforts to try to influence Congress ; the unusual thing about this one is the widespread character of the movement and the great advance in the technique of the campaign as a result no doubt of our experience in the art of nation-wide propaganda during the World War . The fire directed upon Congress now does not , of course , come only from women but from endless church organizations , from colleges , from societies of every kind and description . If the Senators had to take their cues simply by estimating superficially where the larger battalions stand , they would vote unanimously for the World Court . They are , however , experts in mass propaganda on a smaller scale by which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful fight to defeat our entry into the League of Nations are not likely to be stampeded by the tremendous demonstrations of hostile public opinion which they are daily encountering . Those Senators who are of the belief that their guide is their conscience , and that they are not in Washington merely to register what they conceive to be the wishes of all or a part of their constituents , will not be swayed by any demonstrations from the galleries or by the thousands of letters and telegrams which are pouring in upon them . Senator Borah , for instance , can not be won by any such mass attack nor by any presidential threatening or use of patronage . In his brilliant essay on Mr. Borah in the current Foreign Affairs Quarterly Walter Lippmann attributes his independence among other causes to the smallness of the home constituency the Senator from Idaho has to listen to . If it were a much larger one it would make no difference in this case . He will get the Court with the reservations he desires or vote against it if it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should always take , though very few take it . If communities desire to be represented by men who do as they are told and yield to more or less public pressure , they should pick such a man in advance . We have heard many complaints lately from regular Republicans at the appearance of a bloc system in Congress , but , granting their arguments , government by the crowd in the galleries or by telegrams and letters is something far worse . Of course constituents have the right to let their representatives know how they feel on any question , but to compel them to vote against their consciences or their beliefs is to substitute mass or mob , rule for representative government . The present situation seems to us to illustrate beyond dispute the need of a nation-wide referendum such as the Democratic Party called for at its last convention on the issue of our entering the League . It will be remembered that Newton D. Baker , prince of casuists , at once made an eloquent plea against the proposal , declaring that it would be unconstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion came with sorry humor from one of the men who succeeded in creating overnight a machinery to take a census of the young Americans they desired to select for death in a needless and useless foreign war , but if it is true let us proceed at once to find a way to let the people speak their minds on vital issues . There are three great issues before us now upon which the people ought to speak : the World Court , the League of Nations , and prohibition . In the case of the World Court we are not at all clear that the bulk of the people want it . The privileged classes in the East appear to , but we are not so certain about others . Hence we should like to see the energy that is now sending telegrams , letters , and delegations to Washington put into creating a ma chinery by which we can find out what the people think . Rare Jane Austen J UST a century and a half ago , in a small village rectory in Hampshire , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven children . Five brothers and a sister had preceded her ; they with a few neighbors were to make up most of her acquaintance during the forty-two years of her life ; she traveled little , never leaving England , never , indeed , going further from Steventon where she was born than to Bath , to London , to Southampton , and finally to Winchester . If ever a life was lived quietly and unobtrusively , it was hers ; she never married ; it is not known that she ever had a lover ; she occupied herself with a little sewing , a little dancing , a little household management . Except for one trick of fate , she differed not a bit from ' thousands of young women ushered into the world in December , 1775 . But that trick was a rather important one ; for at the age of twenty-one she happened to write " Pride and Prejudice . " In Winchester Cathedral , where Jane Austen is buried , her devoted family had laid a black marble stone on which they paid tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity and faith of their distinguished relative . These are qualities that none would wish now to deny her ; but in the family grief at her untimely death they were probably stressed a little unduly and tended to crowd out certain other qualities not less important . If her novels tell little of her character , her letters reveal far more . At twenty she could write to her sister Cassandra : I danced twice with Warren last night , and once with Mr. Charles Watkins , and , to my inexpressible astonishment , I entirely escaped John Lyford . . . . You scold meso much in the nice long letter which I have this moment received from you that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved . Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together . . . . I look forward with great impatience to it the ball as I rather expect to receive an offer from my friend in the course of the evening . I shall refuse him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . . . . Tell Mary that I make over Mr. Heartley and all his estate to her for her sole use and benefit in future , and not only him but all my other admirers into the bargain wherever she can find them , even the kiss which C. Powlett wanted to give me , as I mean to confine myself in future to Mr. Tom Lefroy , for whom I do n't care sixpence . This sort of high-spirited nonsense filled her letters ; balls  --  the simplest country dances , one ' gathers  --  afternoon calls , walks , and gossip brought it forth ; to praise she responded lightly : " I am very much flattered by your commendation of my last letter , for I wrote only for fame , and without any view to pecuniary emolument . " The knowledge of human nature expressed in her novels is anticipated when she remarks : " Mr. Richard Harvey is going to be married ; but as it is a great secret , and only known to half the neighborhood , you must not mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a little writing-desk that their author could balance easily on her knee , and that the advent of callers or the necessity of performing any unimportant task temporarily suspended the production of literature . It is not surprising , therefore , to - find the following casual mention of " Pride and Prejudice " under its earlier title : " I do not wonder at your wanting to read ' First Impressions ' again , so seldom as you have gone through it , and that so long ago . I am much obliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat behind you . I have long secretly wished it might be done , but had n'ot courage to make the request . " Even later , when the balls were long since over , Miss Austen was not without a certain caustic observation of her neighbors and a lively interest in what might be considered by some as trivial matters : I shall not tell you anything more of Wm . Digweed 's china , as your silence on the subject makes you unworthy of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being her neighbors . I would have her enjoy the idea to the utmost , as I suspect there will not be much in the reality . , . . Miss Hook is a well-behaved , genteelish woman ; Mrs. Drew well-behaved , without being at all genteel . Mr. Wynne seems a chatty and rather familiar young man . . . . I mean to wear out my spotted muslin before I go . You will exclaim at this , but mine really has signs of feebleness , which , with a little care , may come to something . . . . You used me scandalously by not mentioning Edward Cooper 's sermons . I tell you everything and it is unknown the mysteries you conceal from me . So the letters ramble on . From the first , written in 1796 , to the last in 1816 they are witty , gay , sharp , occupied with trifles that their writer 's neatness and sly comments enliven , letters that must have been a delight to receive and a challenge to answer . It is indicated more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that lady , in giving her sister 's epistles to a niece shortly before her own death in 1845 , took care to destroy not only her own letters but every scrap of Jane 's which she considered too personal for possible later publication . What remains gives an acceptably rounded picture of the younger Miss Austen ? one that her biographers have often forgotten .
