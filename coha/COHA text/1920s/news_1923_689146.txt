txt The missing evidence in the Fuller case , for the mysterious disappearance of which Edward M. Fuller and William Frank , partners in the bankrupt brokerage firm of E. M. Fuller &; Co. , have been confined for two months in Ludlow Street Jail , has been returned even more mysteriously to Judge Henry W. Goddard of the United States District Court . A motion will be made by the attorneys for Fuller and before Judge Goddard next Wednesday for their release from imprisonment on the contempt charge . The story of the return of the papers is told in an affidavit by Fuller . upon which the motion for his discharge and that of from their imprisonment for contempt will be based . It was substantiated yesterday by Harold A. Content of Griffiths &; Content , who succeeded William J. Fallon as their counsel . According to Mr. Content , he received a telephone call from a man who gave his name as " Mr. Bascom , " and told him that the missing papers had been sent to Judge Goddard by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and Broadway , on ' July 9 . Mr. Content - skid he ha : 4 made an unsuccessful attempt to trace-title sender of the package of papers through the Western Union office . He a.dcl6d that the same person apparently had calledl Fuller by telephone at the Ludlow Street jail and had informed him that the papers had been delivered to Judge , Goddard . Fuller , he said , requested his unknown telephone informant to con-11 vey the information to his attorneys . Homes Searched for Papers . The return of the papers , it became known , followed the issuance of search warrants more than a week ago by Judge ' Augustus N. Hand , giving the ' Federal authorities the right to search the home of Mrs. Edward M. Fuller in East Fifty-first Street and the home of a Mrs. Brandes . The Federal agents were unable to find the papers at either of these places , and a search at two addresses in Brooklyn proved equally unsuccessful . Application for the search warrant was made by Assistant United States District Attorney William J. Millard . who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indictment of Fallon for bribery of a juror in the Durrell-Gregory mail fraud case . Attached to Mr. Millard 's application was an affidavit by Ernest Eidlitz. formerly an employe of the law firm of Fallon &; Magee in their office in the Knickerbocker Building at Broadway and Forty-second Street and understood to have been the discharged employe referred to by Fallon in his statement denying that he was guilty of bribery and declaring that his indictment was a frame-up . Eidlitz stated in his affidavit that the missing papers were taken from the law office of Joseph Shalleck , which is really in the same suite occupied by Fallon &; by a man named Neugast. whose first name he said he did not know . Shalleck was campaign manager for James J. Hines , Tammany leader of the Eleventh Assembly District , when the latter ran for the Democratic nomination for Borough President of Manhattan in 1021 , and was badly beaten when he went into Charles F. Murphy 's district election night to check up on the returns . Fallon and his partner . Eugene J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank in the criminal charges against them , received the papers from Hays , St. John &; Moore , attorneys for the Fuller firm in the bankruptcy proceedings , who received them from the receiver on a stipulation that they should be returned . The failure of Fuller and Frank to produce the papers when ordered to do so by Harold P. Coffin , referee in bankruptcy , led to Judge Goddard ordering them imprisoned for contempt . The papers were obtained by Hays . St. John &; Moore before they were avail-. able to District Attorney 7oab H. BanIton for use in the criminal proceedings in the State Courts and disappeared after they had been made available for criminal prosecution by Mr. Coffin 's ruling and the  --  Federal Court 's decision . Among the papers was the corre ! spondence between the firm and F. E. Link of Westmoreland , Tenn. , a cornplsinant in the criminal action , a number of canceled vouchers and a book of check stubs . To Oppose Release of Prisoners . Notice of his intention to move for the discharge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! tempt order was served yesterday by 1 Mr. Griffiths on Francis L. Kohlman j and Carl J. Austrian , attorneys for the i trustee in the Fuller bankruptcy case . ' Mr. Kohlman and William M. ChadbcArne. attorney for the Creditors ' Committee , said they would oppose the motion to release Fuller and from jail before the bankruptcy hearings were finished .. It was said that these attorneys still had some hope of recovering some hidden assets of the Fuller firm which would reduce materially the losses of their customers . They were said to believe that there would be less chance of this If Fuller and were released from the contempt charge . Mr. Content . Mr. Griffiths 's partner , expressed surprise that news of the return of the papers to Judge Goddard had become public , but admitted readily the truth of the report . Mr. Content said lie was in his office on July 9 when he received a telephone call from a person who refused to give his name but said he was " a person well disposed toward Fuller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just been sent to Judge Goddard from the Western Union office at Fortyfirst Street and Broadway . " Mr. Content continued . " Ile said he wanted me to know about it , but when I asked him to give his name he said he preferred not to give it . " Later Mr. Griffith saw Fuller at the jail and , before he told him of the telephone call I had received , Fuller said he had received a call and had directed the anonymous informant to communicate with his attorneys . Tried to Trace the Sender . " -I inquired at the Western Union office at Forty-first Street and Broadway and they said they had no record or the sender of the packa. , , - ; ? - : , but did ha-irira record of a package Laving been sent to Judge Goddard 's chambers . They explained that there was nothing unusual about that , as it happened frequently that some one would bring in a package to be delivered and the sender 's name would not be taken . " Our telephone operator , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . who telephones this office . I asked her afterward why she put an anonymous call on to me . She said the man had first asked for Mr. Griffiths , who was out , and then asked for me and that he told her that- his name was Mr. Bascom . " Asked why Fuller and if they knew that the papers had disappeared from the possession or the custody of their attorneys , Fallon and , did not set up this as a defense instead of refusing to tell Judge Goddard where the papers were , Mr. Content replied : " We were n't their attorneys then . " Mr. Content then explained that when he and his partner . Mr. Griffiths , first appeared in the case for Fuller and , before the referee in bankruptcy about three weeks ago Fallon and ... Eugene , ? who had been the brokers ' attorneys in the indictment for bucketing to which they pleaded guilty in the Court of General Sessions , had retired from the case . " When we were retained Fuller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Content intimated that Fuller had become dissatisfied with Fallon . He added that he and his partner had only the interests of Fuller and to serve . Mr. Content 's story of the telephone calls is corroborated in Fuller 's affidavit , which is in part as follows : " Deponent further desires to state that on Saturday . July 7 , he received an anonymous telephone call informing ? him that the very papers upon which he had been committed for contempt for failure to produce had been sent to the ' Hon. Henry W. Goddard as District Judge to his chambers at 233 Broadway , New York City , by a Messenger employed at the estern " Union telegraph office at Forty-first Street and Broadway , only one block distant from the place where the affidavits herein referred to stated that the said papers existed on June 1 , 1923 . " The person who spoke to your deponent would not give his name , but your C.-portent asked him to call up the deponent 's attorneys , Griffiths &; Content , and tell them about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward a man giving- his name as Bascom did call up Mr. Content , giving him the same information as was given your deponent . " That thereafter your deponent caused inquiry to be made at the office of the Western Union at Forty-first Street ' vasBroadway to determine whether it , t , , as a fact or not that such a package had been sent to the said Hon. Henry W. C .... eddard , and your deponent was inform.0 that such a package had peen sent , although the telegraph company could find no record of the name of the sender . " One of the affidavits signed by Eidlltz , who is said to have given a great deal of information to the United ' States District Attorney , follows : " Ernest Eldlita , bang duly sworn , deposes and says : Deponent was at all times mentioned herein employed in the office ' of William J. Fallon and Eugene , lawyers , at 152 West Forty-second Street , Borough of Manbattast , City . County and State of New York . That on or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and records from the firm of Edward M. Fuller and W. Frank , doing business under the name of E. M. Fuller &; Co : , at the office of Joseph Shalleck , immediately ad , lotning the said office of J. Fallon and Eugene , were placed in a satchel by one Neugast , whese first name is unknown . and taken from the said office by the said Neugast . " That upon information and belief . the said satchel containing the said books and records was taken by the said Neugast either to the premises occupied by Laura Studebaker at 107 Whalley Street , Freeport , Nassau County , New York . or to the premises occupied by one Leo Morris on Nassau Boulevard . Freeport . " That the ground of deponent 's information and the source of his belief are statements glade in the deponent 's hearing at the time and subsequent to the time when the said books and records were so taken from the said oft:co of Joseph Shalleck . " Even if released from Imprisonment on Judge Goddard 's contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Federal authorities . Judge Fitz . henry has already directed the issuance of a bench warrant for them to plead to the indictment . charging them with the use of the mails to defraud customers of Clarkson &; Co. , - another bankrupt brokerage firm , fri which Fuller and are alleged to have had the cohLtrolling interest . The contempt sentence , however , would have run indefinitcgy less the defendants were purged ttj ? Production of the missing documents or furnished some explanation . The seri= tences on their conviction for bucketing : which , with time off for , good behavior , would amount to only eleven months each , are by the order of Judge Charles C.

It was predicted that he would insist upon further explanations - concerning the g g --  , cre before Feil , F and could expsct reloease.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
