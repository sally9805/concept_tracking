King Ahmed Fuad of Egypt , fat and happy , now on an official tour of Europe , last week paid a surprise visit to the League of Nations at Geneva . He caused a mild panic among the staid members of the Secretariat . Little used to entertaining pompous monarchs who travel as does Egypt 's Fuad with a small army of retainers , Secretariat members thought only in the nick of time to provide a throne for the dusky , red-fezzed potentate . Acting Secretary General J. A. M. C. Avenol , flustered in the absence of his chief , suave , assured Sir Eric Drummond , madly canvassed Geneva 's second-hand shops until he found a massive chair heavy with carvings and bright red plush into which the king of Egypt would decorously fit . The democratic , glass-walled Council Chamber of the Secretariat was made into a temporary throne-room , memoranda of etiquette were issued to the press , warning them to appear in sombre and respectful clothes . Wives of League officials were cautioned against offending Moslem sensibilities with bare arms , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly removed when Secretary Avenol spied a disobedient British correspondent in a checkered suit , pushed him into an alcove . <P> Serene as always , King Fuad arrived , noted the makeshift throne , diplomatically tested only the edge of its capacity . To M. Avenol , still warm from his recent labors , King Fuad hinted : " Each time Egypt has been invited to international meetings under the auspices of the League she has been happy to participate . " <P> Common knowledge is Egypt 's long-standing wish to have her status as an independent kingdom confirmed by membership in the League . Equally aware , however , is the League of Great Britain 's strong opposition to this step , for Egypt , which Britain relinquished as a Protectorate in 1922 but which she still maintains the right to control because of the Suez Canal , is the chief route to India , vital artery of British trade . <P> Easy-going King Fuad 's surprise visit was not regarded , last week , as more than another impotent gesture , destined to bear little fruit .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
