Eight youths from Browne &; Nichols , Cambridge , Mass. preparatory school , responded to the shrill yawps of a blond 13-year-old coxswain last week and won the Thames Challenge Cup in the Henley Regatta , second highest English rowing honor. * Not since 1922 when Walter Hoover of Duluth won the Diamond Sculls , famed single scull race , had the U. S. had so large a share in the glory that is Henley victory . <P> Favored among U. S. entrants had been Columbia 's 150-pounders , winners of a preliminary regatta at Marlow and during the U. S. rowing season losers of only one race . Eliminating the Westminster Bank crew in the first heat , Columbia stroked to a one-length victory in the second over the Kingston Rowing Club boat , coached by R. C. Sheriff , young insurance-broker author of Journey 's End , current War play . Columbia was eliminated in a windy third heat by the heavier crew of Trinity College , Cambridge . <P> Next day Trinity met the Massachusetts youngsters . At first Browne &; Nichols trailed by one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised their stroke , imperceptibly slid into a quarter-length lead . Trinity answered , drew level . Both shells were even 150 yards from the finish . Both spurted . Browne &; Nichols spurted fastest . That afternoon they raced the Thames Rowing Club , won by a length and a quarter . They were later to be presented to Ambassador Charles Gates Dawes , the Lord Mayor of London , King George . Browne &; Nichols is almost exclusively a Harvard preparatory school . Harvard men last week rejoiced at the prospect of a sequence of Harvard rowing victories after the Henley champions matriculate . <P> Joe Wright Jr . of Canada , son of the University of Pennsylvania 's oldtime rowing coach ( who was there to watch him row ) , lost by three feet the Diamond Sculls , which he won last year , to Holland 's L. H. F. Gunther . <P> *First : Senior Grand Challenge Cup , won last week by the Leander Rowing Club of England .                 @ @ @ @
