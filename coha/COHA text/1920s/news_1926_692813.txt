txt Now that the general strike is over , business men are figuring the cost . Mr. Churchill gave some welcome consolation by his announcement that direct cost to the government was only $3,750,000 and that no further taxation would be imposed . But government expenditure is the least of financial costs . Mr. Churchill expects that his revenue estimates Will be realized this year . There may be , however , a falling off next year , due to decreased income tax . Heaviest costs of the strike must be borne by #1-dustry . There is actual loss to firms and wage earners of practically 12 working days .. To this must be added the lost contracts , shipping delays , and resulting unemployment .. Wage earners have lost some $100,000,000 in wages . The cost to the trade unions is said to be over $17,000,000 or more than half their accumulated funds . Unemployment has already increased by over 500,000 , and is likely to grow . Opinion of the Stock Exchange on the strike 's ultimate effect on industry is shown very clearly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strike . The Stock Exchange account which closed on May 7 coincided roughly with the period of the strike . From the price records at the opening and close of the account it can be seen that a cheer distinction was made between the general run of industrials such as iron and steel , textiles , oil and tobacco shares , and those of department stores and breweries . The latter alone fell on supposition that stores and breweries could not recoup themselves from the incurred losses . This opinion was indorsed by Gordon Selfridge , Jr . The direct cost to industry is estimated by Walter Runciman , a leading shipowrer and banker , at $150,000 , - 000 . Coal bore $35,000,000 , iron and steel $17,500,000 , textiles $25,000,000 and engineering $12,500,000 . These figures take no account of lost orders and shipping delays . " A grave injury , " said Mr. Runciman , " but things are not altigether bad with us , certainly not so bad ns for any one of the continental countries . Great as has been the injury during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise among our merchants who sell abroad , and anything like the same industry in the miners themselves as followed and led up to such a rapid recovery after the 13 weeks ' stoppage in the coal mines in 1921 , there seems very little doubt that we could recover from it in the course of a very few weeks . " The 1921 stoppage is estimated to have cost Britain in the neighborhood of $1.000,000,000 . Yet , as Mr. Runciman pointed out , in six months after the stoppage banking deposits had increased by $500,000,000 and steel production doubled in four months . Their recovery showed the remarkable resiliency of the country . In addition , Britain by return to the gold standard is today in a stronger position than in 1921 . The p.:und stands higher than at any time for ten years , and Britain passed through the recent crisis without removal of any American or Continental deposits from London . A remarkable indication of stability and confidence in British finance , Mr. Runciman pointed out . It is of course probable that the sterling dollar exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike . There is always a seasonal demand for sterling at this time of year by American tourists . Demand for dollars now on the other hand is slight . CHURCHILL SEES OUTLOTIK UNCERTAIN Moreover , British is not yet out of the wood of industrial disputes . The coal strike is still unsettled and looks for the moment as though it might drag on several weeks longer . On its effects Mr. Churchill , speaking last night , said " a two or three weeks ' coal strike is recoverable , eight or ten weeks would make a deep marl , : on the livelihood of the whole people , while 12 or 14 weeks would probably mean a year and a half to two years of hard times for this country . " With the stoppage prolonged beyond the end of May , Mr. Churchill again threatens a supplementary budget with increased taxation . " The outlook , " said Mr. Churchill , " is grim , but anything is better than to allow an industry in which masters and men have so managed their affairs that trade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general taxpayer . " - If the government maintains as firm an attitude on the subsidy question as it did on the'general strike , Britain may yet emerge from its present trials in vigorous health .
