Indians are sedentary and submissive , Britons kinetic and therefore dominant . Significant , last week , was an illustration of this contrast afforded when His Majesty 's Viceroy of India , Frederick Lindley Wood , Baron Irwin , set out from Delhi to take what he described as " a short rest and vacation . " <P> Speeding north by train and motor car to Dehra Dun , His Excellency began to " rest " by setting out from there on horseback into the jungle covered foothills of the Himalayas , mightiest of mountains . <P> Only four members of the Viceregal Staff accompanied Lord Irwin . When the jungle grew too dense for horseback riding , the Viceroy cast dignity to the Himalayan breezes , and began with gusto to scramble and to climb . Leaving the jungle behind , as they ascended , the party made a rocky climb of nearly 5,000 feet to the summit of Chaur Mountain , 11,966 feet above sea level . Then , continuing northward , they scrambled down some 7,000 feet into the jungle beyond . On the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Phagu , where he was met by a motor car and whisked 14 miles to the comfortable Viceregal Lodge at Simla . <P> There a member of Lord Irwin 's sinewy entourage told with a grin how the Viceroy had passed en route through the territory of the insignificant and torpid Rajah of Jubbal . Polite surprise that the Englishmen had ventured so far afield to hunt was the Potentate 's first reaction . But when informed that they had left their sporting guns behind and were merely out for exercise , the Rajah of Jubbal became morose , evinced incredulity , and was clearly worried as to possible designs upon his little raj by a snooping Big White Viceroy . <P> As robust , hearty Viceroy Irwin prepared to return from Simla to his Capital at Delhi , despatches told that he had " benefited immensely " by his Himalayan tramp and scramble .
