The rangy , steel-grey , 52-year-old junior Senator from Connecticut , Hiram Bingham of New Haven , who styles himself " explorer " * sooner than " politician " and who is more professor* than publicist , returned to the U. S. some weeks ago from an extended tour of the Orient . On his way back from war-ridden Tientsin , he visited his birthplace , Honolulu . <P> Delayed correspondence last week told of Explorer-Senator Bingham 's behavior on the August evening that he dined with Governor Wallace Rider Farrington and a distinguished gathering at Washington Place , the governor 's mansion . <P> Called upon to speak , Mr. Bingham arose and , with a glint in his grey eye , said : " I am , I believe , the only American representative of government who has ever refused to enter the doors of the Army &; Navy Club in Manila . " <P> It was a provocative beginning . Nowhere is a good story better appreciated than in isolated Hawaii ; no topic is more popular in Hawaii than anything pertaining to the behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. citizens of the Philippines . <P> Mr. Bingham 's audience was all attention as he proceeded to relate how , a few weeks previously , he had been invited as guest of honor to a banquet in the Army &; Navy Club of Manila . Mr. Bingham had asked whether outstanding native politicians , such as President Manuel Quezon of the Philipine Senate or Senator Sergio Osmena , independence leader , would be present . <P> " Certainly not , " snorted the Army &; Navy Club of Manila , and proceeded to instruct Mr. Bingham that no Filipinos ( except , of course , servants ) were admitted within the doors of the Army &; Navy Club of Manila . <P> " Then I am sorry , gentlemen , " Mr. Bingham said he replied , " but I shall not be able to accept your invitation . " <P> The company around Governor Farrington 's table frowned approvingly and felt sure that no such contretemps could possibly occur in Hawaii . They nodded sagely as Mr. Bingham said : " I want to tell you right now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to invite a few of the cultured and prominent Filipinos to be their guests at a tea , the agitation for Philippine independence would die right then and there . " <P> They frowned still more approvingly and said , " Ah ! " and " Oh ! " and " Not really ! " as Mr. Bingham continued to cite incidents of his trip to illustrate what he denounced as the snobbery , discourtesy , superciliousness , selfishness , greed , hypocrisy and effrontery of many a white missionary , military and business man in the Orient . He told of a Chinese graduate of Yale who was cursed like a coolie by a Shanghai bank clerk ; of signs in a park on Chinese soil : " No Chinamen or dogs allowed . " He flayed the whites , British and U. S. alike , who commit and permit such arrogance . He roused Governor Farrington 's dinner party to his own white heat of indignation and then , suddenly , blazed out : " There 's beginning to be too much of that kind of thing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-consciously fixed stare of a banker across the table brought Mr. Bingham back to earth . Hesitation lengthened into a pause which Mr. Bingham ended with half a cough and half a chuckle . He had talked half an hour , he said , and would now stop .
