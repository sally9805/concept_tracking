When the plaint of tobacco jobbers and retailers reached President George J. Whelan of the Union Tobacco Co. - that they were not making a living margin of profit on tobacco sales-President Whelan set up a smart system of selling them goodwill as well as tobacco . The system , as developed last week , is to give Union Tobacco stock shares to jobbers and retailers in proportion to their purchases . For every $1,000 of Union Tobacco goods a jobber buys he is to get one certificate of Union Tobacco stock worth nominally $30 . That is a 3% bonus . For every $300 that a retailer buys he gets one share , or 10% bonus . This is in addition to trade discounts , such as all tobacco companies give . Thus President Whelan ingratiates himself with tobacco distributors who have been vexed with the price reductions so widely made by chain store organizations . And with the chain store managers and clerks also . The more tobacco United Cigar , Schulte and other chained employes sell , the more Union Tobacco shares they can earn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales project . <P> While makers of Camels , Lucky Strikes , Chesterfields , Old Golds , by means of well-organized advertising campaigns induce customers to demand their brands , Union Tobacco with very little advertising induces cigar store clerks to push its chief cigaret brand , Three Kings ( first called Three Castles ) .
