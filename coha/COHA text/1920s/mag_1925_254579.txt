Five days before their biennial meet against the combined Harvard-Yale track team , the athletes of Oxford , of Cambridge , landed in the U. S. on wobbly sea-legs . <P> " Why do you come so late ? " asked critics . " Because five days is enough time for our men to train in ; and if it is not enough , we can not afford longer , " replied the Britishers . " Why have you no coach ? " asked pressmen . " For the same reason : we can not afford one , " said they . At Cambridge , Mass. , blond David , Lord Burghley , heard a pistol pop , took a step , two , three , sailed over a white hurdle , repeated this bounding , this stepping for 120 yards , winning the first event for England . <P> The 100-yard dash was credited to one Alfred ( " Truck " ) Miller of Har- vard , a 200-lb. runner . Angry spectators near the starting line asserted that Miller , though no hurdler , had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Sabin Carr , with a leap of 13 feet-took the pole vault and the fancy of the gallery , which perceived in him a likely intercollegiate champion . <P> Stevenson , once of Princeton , won the quarter-mile for Oxford . <P> Captain D. G. A. Lowe of Cambridge was conceded to have small chance of winning the mile against such runners as Ellsworth , " Red " Haggerty , Byron Cutcheon . To begin with , Lowe was tired . He had already spent himself to take the half-mile in the fast time of 1:53 2/5 ; moreover , it was obvious that the U. S. combination had passed a word around in the locker-room : " Kill off Lowe . " First Cutcheon set a parching pace . Lowe seemed tired . Haggerty replaced Cutcheon , looking over his shoulder at the dark-haired , the Arab-skinned Lowe , three yards behind . So they ran until 150 yards from the end . Then Lowe , as if he had strapped the wind to his ankles , ran past the red Haggerty , won the race . <P> Counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meet was a draw , 6 to 6 . Counting second and third places , it went to the U. S. team by 61 points to 47 . <P> Of seven Yale-Harvard Oxford-Cambridge meets , the U. S. universities have now won four , lost three . <P> On Saturday , July 18 , Oxford-Cambridge was scheduled to meet Cornell- Princeton.
