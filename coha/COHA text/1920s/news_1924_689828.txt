txt I am amazed at your editorial in this morning 's TIMES in regard to Representative Cordell Hull . You speak of fairness , and I wonder if this unwarranted attack upon Mr. Hull is your idea of being fair or just . It is to be deplored by all honest , fairminded citizens who are 100 per cent . American that anything like tho Teapot Dome scandal should have occurred , I hope that President Coolidge will leave no stone unturned to expose and punish the guilty ones . I think the American people agree with Senator Caraway when he said that ex-Secretary of the Interior Fall was guilty of treason and a second Benedict Arnold . It is to be devoutI5 , hoped that this scandal will not be quieted down and glossed over , but exposed , so that a similar disgrace will never happen again . In view of the revelations already disclosed by the Senate committee Involving various of the Cabinet members in these fraudulent transactions , it appears to me that Mr. Hull was justified in his statement .
