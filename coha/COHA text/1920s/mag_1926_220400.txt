At Bled , Jugoslavia , the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia ( Benes ) , Roumania ( Mitilineu ) and Jugoslavia ( Nintchitch ) assembled amid the awful diplomatic secrecy characteristic of all meetings of the Little Entente. * The announced agenda included discussion of : 1 ) The European situation-presumably reference to the growing ascendancy of Italy+ as the protector of the Little Entente and the coincident ambiguous position of France in that role . Notorious are Mussolini 's secret conferences with Jugoslav Premier Nintchitch , his furtherance of a Roumanian loan at Rome , his diplomatic feelers into the Eastern Balkans , notably signalized last week by the bestowal upon Greek Dictator-President Pangalos of the Italian Great Cross . 2 ) Proposals to abolish inter-Little Entente customs control . 3 ) The perennial " Hungarian question " ( i.e. , Hungarians are perpetually talking about monarchy and hatching means to burst the encirclement of Hungary on three sides by the Little Entente ) . As the three Premiers sat down to deliberate these issues a telegram was handed to Czechoslovak Benes . It contained an order from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he assist it in an attack upon certain grain tariff laws dear to the Czechoslovak Cabinet by resigning his Foreign Ministry forthwith . The Little Entente Conference broke up ere it began , as its dominant figure ( Benes ) hastened to Prague . <P> * Established ( 1920 ) at Belgrade upon the instance of Benes ( See CZECHOSLOVAKIA ) by the signing of a Convention between these nations based upon existing treaties and providing for mutual defense and especially against an attack by Hungary on one of the member states . <P> +Notorious are Mussolini 's secret conferences with Jugoslav Premier Nintchitch , his furtherance of a Roumanian loan at Rome , his diplomatic feelers into the Eastern Balkans , notably signalized last week by the bestowal upon Greek Dictator-President Pangalos of the Italian Great Cross .
