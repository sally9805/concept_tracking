" <P> BURNING BUSH-Louis Untermeyer-Harcourt Brace ( $2.00 ) . <P> Prolific author of critical essays on poetry , Poet Untermeyer sticks to conventional rhythms in his own verse , but experiments with new rhymes : " fronds-bronze , millions-brilliance , color-duller , cardboard-hard , bored , " - studied inaccuracies which emphasize a lack of spontaneity . Indeed , this poet is at his best in historical comment , or in one satiric sonnet that is an anthology of Georgian poetry , complete with bucolic landscape where " immemorial lambs keep moonlit trysts with deathless nightingales.
