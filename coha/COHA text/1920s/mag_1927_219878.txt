With tears in his voice , if not in his eyes , the senectissimus of all U. S. Senators stood up and pleaded with snarling filibusterers for the passage of his Second Deficiency bill , dearer to him than all investigating of slush funds . He , Francis Emroy Warren of Wyoming , 82 , Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , had made this plea more than 20 times during the 40-hour Reed v. Reed wrangle . He had spent half of one night on a Senate lounge when he should have been home in bed . His snow-white moustache drooped ; his eyes were sunken , bleary ; his voice quavered . Somebody said : " I object . " His last plea was dashed to the floor like a broken relic . Like an angered god , he lifted his voice above the Senate din , pronounced a commandment : " Every Senator ca n't have his own damned way . " <P> But filibusters heeded commandments no more than deficiency bills . <P> If there is a man in the U. S today who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr. Warren . His fame goes back to the Civil War when he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for gallantry on the field of battle ; back to the ' 70s when he , astride a horse , was making Wyoming something more than an Indian playground ; back to the ' 80s when he was Governor of the territory ; back to 1890 when he first entered the U. S. Senate . ... And perhaps in 1931 , when his present term expires , he will be guiding his last annual three-billion-dollaf flock of appropriation bills through a stormy Senate with the skillful hand that gave him the subtitle of " The Greatest Shepherd since Abraham . " <P> Francis Emroy Warren-hero , rancher , pioneer , lawgiver , financier , shepherd , Grand Old Man .
