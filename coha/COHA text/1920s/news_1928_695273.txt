txt DISPUTING AN ISSUE . Land , Not Grain Prices , RespeinsIble for Western Farmers ' Position . To the Editor of The New York Mica : Your editorial this morning relative to Corn Belt opposition to Mr. Hoover and the issue which you refer to as wheat strikes me as a wild shot at an issue that does not exist . Mr. Hoover has made no statement about raising the tariff on wheat so high that none can be imported . Every flour manufacturer knows that to make high-grade flour No. 1 Northern wheat is necessary . There is practically none of this produced in the United States . We bring in this wheat from Canada and with our own a very fine grade of flour is produced . There is certainly no such political issue in the West and there ' is not likely to be . Farmers in this country get away from the wheat crop as much as possible . This must go away from the farm , while corn can be fed to cattle and hogs on the farm , making them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in the long run unprofitable if live stock is not the principal factor . There is nothing to grain farming alone . When yearling steers are selling in Chicago for $16.70 and heavy beef steers are $16.40 a hundred and hogs bring $11.75 a huadred , I can not see a reason for the Mississippi Valley to now turn to the Democrats for further benefit . I should say that when a carload of steers will bring $5,051.20 the farmer is getting a fair return from his finished product . It must be remembered that it took pretty prime cattle to bring $10 a hundred under Democratic administration just after the war . Speculation in land is responsible for the present situation in the West . The farmer loaded up with highpriced land and this speculation almost ruined him . It takes about two acres of grass to carry a steer and on $300 land this can not be done . Over a very long period of time the farmer has been satisfied with Republican administration . He is now . These issues on paper are made by farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not time for paper farmers . Mr. Hoover , in my opinion , is capable of working out the farm situation , and I know that the West will back him all the way . A STTINTIVITZ New York , July 28 , 1928.
