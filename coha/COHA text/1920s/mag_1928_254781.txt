Sixty three men , one jump or more ahead of death , were listed last week by the Army Air Corps . Called the Caterpillar Club this unofficial organization is composed of all U. S. flyers who have dodged destruction by parachute leaps from disabled planes . Parachutes are made of silk ; silk comes from caterpillars . <P> At the top of the list was the name of Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh . Four times has he jumped for dear life , oftener than any native flyer . His disciples wondered why he has discarded the device to which he owes four debts of life . In Central America he is flying without a parachute .
