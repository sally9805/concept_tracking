txt In one week , Socialism in Great . Britain . as well as France , has suffered several severe defeats . The era lf paternal government is coming to an end and men are beginning once more to rely upon self-help and private rnternrise . Both the dole system and the housing plan have been suddenly abolished . Last May fully 1,100.000 people were receiving doles . In other words they were pensioned by the government because of unemployment . At a time when there was urgent need of labor , a million workers were kept unemployed by a system of pensions . It is not known who invented this dole system . It was a blunder from the first , and it is now abolished . Tile soldiers and sailors-4.500,000 of them . have been absorbed into indu5-try . They are now practically all back at work . The present rate of unemployment is only 1 . " . -e , which is normal . The housing scheme , too , by which the Government was to be the supreme landlord , has had a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to save its face by changing its scheme into a subsidy system . A bonus of $750 is now offered to any private individual who will go ahead and build a house according to the Government 's specifications . But the fact is that the Government has tried for a whole year to build houses : and it has failed completely . More than 500,000 houses are needed at once ; and the Government has built 150 . Worse still , it has put up the prices of building material and interposed so many vbstrtv:tion : : , that private builders have been temporarily pushed aside . The Government has prepared plans for workmen 's cottages which would cost at least $5.000 to build . It has allowed a committee of architects to insist . upon all manner of fads and frills . so as to have what Lloyd George calls " houses fit for heroes to live in . " But as the aforesaid heroes would have to pay $500 rent for these government mansions , not many have been built . The whole grandiloquent scheme has tumbled ignominiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will insist upon its fancy specifications being adopted ; but the pressure of the houselcss will soon cause the specifications to be thrown aside ; and then there will come an era of jerrybuilding. in which builders will erect $1,500 houses and receive half of their cost from the government . Thus does the theorist always defeat himself . Instead of having houses fit for heroes , we shall presently have in England several thousands of shanties and tarpaper shacks. as any sort of shelter is better than the wide outdoors . As British bricklayers are at present laying only about 400 bricks a day , the cost of brick houses has become excessive . It is now entirely out of the question to build brick houses for workmen . W3iat is needed is a tight , good-enough house , with five or six rooms , that can be rented for $100 or $150 a year . Any practical builder would agree to supply such houses , of either wood or concrete , if the government will only get out of the way with its luxurious specifications- . So , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private contractor ? " Go ahead and build houses and we 'll pay you $750 per house , " the danger of socialism has passed . One more government department has gone ingloriously to the scrapheap . The facts have wrecked the theories and the bureaucrats of England are sadder if not wiser . The execrated private landlord has . after all , been found to be a very necessary and helpful person . Government housing will not be tried again in England . After all its promises and preparations  --  after a flood of oratory and rainbow-chasing , the net result is 150 houses , at a time when tens of thousands of families arc living in the utmost squalor . Now comes the private landlord to the rescue , and the coming 12 months will show what he can do .
