Having quashed the idea of Progress for all time , Dean Inge of St. Paul 's , London , has nothing left to deplore but the unwillingness of college girls to marry . This he did at a meeting to support the endowment of four women 's colleges at Oxford . He reported himself as astonished to learn that of 12,607 women " who have passed through Oxford " only 657 have married . He concluded that the rest were hardhearted . The principal of Newnham College , Cambridge , denied the charge . Miss Underwood of the Women 's Freedom League retaliated that there was little in marriage to attract highly educated women . And Dr. Joshish Oldfield agreed that brainless women make the best wives .
