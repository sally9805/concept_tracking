Peering intently from beneath her perky white visor , crafty Helen Wills , of California , kept track of every tennis ball that came whizzing her way at Forest Hills , L. I. When she had dealt firmly with the last one , she was still national singles champion and , with Mrs. George Wightman , of Philadelphia , national doubles champion . <P> Like Glenna Collett , pensive golfer , Helen masks her competitive ardors with a sphinxlike countenance . Sport writers have dubbed her " Poker Face . " Also like Glenna , she has the wrist and forearm of a strongish man . <P> Inscrutable , Helen forged through three preliminary matches in one hour , eight minutes of playing time . Still inscrutable , she tussled through the semi-final against strenuous Mary K. Browne , ageless Californian , losing her one set of the tournament when a misunderstanding jogged her service rhythm on Miss Browne 's set-point . <P> In the other semi-final match , burly Molla Mallory planted herself far back by the baseline , pounded Eleanor Goss out of the tournament with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6-1 , 6-3 . As sinewy as Molla and much more cunning , Poker Face dealt out aces , forced shot after shot off Holla 's tight-clenched racquet . <P> Eleanor Goss and Marion Z. Jessup were the other doubles finalists .
