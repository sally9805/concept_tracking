William M. Butler , Campaign Manager of President Coolidge , announced that his candidate would not go on the stump , but would campaign by radio from the Capital . The radiocasters threw up their hands in supplication and distraction . <P> " That makes it unanimous , " they cried . " Now they 've all said they would do it . " <P> Indeed the radiocasters were in a quandary and the campaign managers had put them there . The entire trouble is that the political managers are not scientists . An official of a large radio company , unnamed , gave out a press statement in which he said : " They are faced with the disappointment right there , for that can not be done except in very limited instances . <P> " In broadcasting on a national scale , we will have to fall back on the land wires of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. as a basis . These wires will receive the speeches from the microphone , where it is set up , and take them to the cities from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations in those cities will put them on the air . In other words , the main wire channel is limited to what the American Telephone and Telegraph Company can provide . It has a service to maintain , and can not throw overboard every thing to give right of way to broad casting . <P> Then the radio man came forward with a sound suggestion-sound as politics and sound as radio wisdom : <P> " . . . A speech which is aimed , for instance , at the industrial centres of the East would have little application to the campaign that will be made among the farm sections of the West . <P> " It should , therefore , be confined to the local stations of the East . Arguments addressed to the farm issues , similarly , should be localized in that region . Where the broadcasting can be confined to one locality the problem will be greatly simplified . . . . Unless the broadcasting of politics is kept within reasonable bounds , the public will tire of it as soon as the novelty wears off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the advice of those of us who have studied the problems of broadcasting , they will not attempt to put on the air long-winded political speeches . I have no hesitancy in saying that the ordinary political speech , as we have known it for years to be delivered from platforms in political campaigns , will not go at all with radio audiences . They will tune out in the middle of it and get some station that is sending jazz or a symphony concert . "
