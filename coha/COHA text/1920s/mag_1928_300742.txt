Potent Pigeon <P> Sirs : <P> I have heard , I think of Col. Charles Augustus Lindbergh and what he did . And I dimly recall Skipper Alain Gerbault of France . Did n't he play tennis once ? Did n't he sail a rowboat around the world or something ? But the man I can not place , though I suppose I should , is Skipper Harry Pigeon of Los Angeles . What did he do ? Why should he be given an Olympic diploma along with Lindbergh and Gerbault ( TIME , Aug. 6 ) ? I have no doubt whatever that he deserved it , but being something of a hero-worshipper I would like a description of just what " Potent Pigeon " accomplished that I have overlooked in the glorious annals of American sportsmanship . <P> HORACE KILMER Brooklyn , N. Y. <P> Potent Pigeon sailed a small boat around the world. - ED . <P> Heeney 's Mother <P> Sirs : <P> Noticed your write-up , in TIME dated July 23 about " Tom Heeney . " I wish you bunch of " pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mention his mother who is 80 years old doing a day 's milking well , I just want you to know that it takes a good woman to do a day 's milking , and even if she is 80 years old , I bet , she could show some of you birds how to keep alive , why do n't you Pen Pushers be " sports " and give the people from the other side a chance to know that the Americans are " Real . " Pick on " Tom " he can stand a little picking , there is lots of him , but respect his Mother , as you would want yours respected . This scribble is from a good bit-O-Scotch in California . <P> So laugh that off . <P> " ANONYMOUS " Santa Barbara , Calif . <P> " Racket " <P> Sirs : <P> If I do not overshoot a reasonable expectancy of service , would you kindly inform me of the precise meaning of the word " rackets " as used by your Cinema Editor in the issue for July 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME 'S editors have furnished me with many a new word for my personal Word Book-with which I take great pains-but " rackets " yields up no satisfactory notation or connotation in its present context . <P> EUGENE P. BERTIN Williamsport , Pa . <P> A racket is a trade or vocation which is loud , bold and often illegal . For example , there is the bootlegging racket , the murder-for-money racket , the dry cleaning racket ( in which Gangster " Scarface Al " Capone of Chicago was hired to protect a group of dry cleaners ) . A racketeer is one who practices a racket. - ED . <P> Life Savers <P> Sirs : <P> I observed with mingled feelings of satisfaction and dismay your reference to our semi-annual statement of profits on page 24 of your issue of July 30 . <P> The satisfaction arises from the fact that you consider our progress of sufficient editorial interest to insert briefly our financial report . I was dismayed however because of your reference to us as " ( friends of smoking , drinking minors ) . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of our business to advertise LIFE SAVERS , directly or indirectly , as a friend of " drinking minors . " <P> It was doubtless your intention to insert a comma or semicolon between the word " drinking " and the word " minors . " We would like to have your assurance that this was your intention . . . .
