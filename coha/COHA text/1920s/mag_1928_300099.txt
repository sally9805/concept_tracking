First 20,000 tons of U. S. barley , the first batch of a 500,000-ton order , was received and test samples were offered to the swine . After sniffing and tasting the U. S. barley the German swine turned up their snouts , refused to eat . <P> The German savants , patient , waited several days until the hogs grew so ravenous that they ate the U. S. barley . That night German swine who had partaken of barley from states other than Colorado , Kansas , Oklahoma and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German Federal Council made a full and specific explanation to German farmers over the radio , warning them against U.
