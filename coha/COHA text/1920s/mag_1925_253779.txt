On the high plains to the south of Nairobi in British East Africa the monkeys jabbered noisily as they swung themselves from the mangrove to the coconut palm and clambered about the juniper and olive trees . The chattering stopped ; curious faces peered through the leaves toward the ground where a disconsolate lion roamed through the tall grass . <P> Far away a giraffe stretched its neck , yawned . A rhinoceros began rooting among the herbs and a hippopotamus wallowed in a nearby river with its colts in view of crocodiles , flamingoes , pelicans , cranes . <P> In another place , an antelope grazed , a zebra pranced . These quadrupeds were hardly disturbed by the diverse noises put up in various directions by the bustard , the secretary-bird , the ostrich , the stork . In the distance , the crashing and the rumbling of a passing elephant could faintly be heard . At the edge of a lake , a giant buffalo bellowed loudly for its mate ; a frightened puff adder shot through the grass with incredible speed . <P> Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , Duke of York , at present visiting in the name of his father , King George , the British possessions in East Africa . On this occasion , accompanied by one attendant , the Prince was ahunting . The two had not proceeded far when they came across large indentations in the crust of the rain-sodden earth , plainly the footprints of an odd-toed ungulate mammal . Carefully , cautiously , noiselessly the tracks were followed . Several miles they went before the object of their sleuthing was sighted . Crack ! spoke the Duke 's rifle . With a howl of rage and pain , a rhinoceroes turned and charged at the second son of King George , York reserved his fire . Nearer and nearer the enraged animal came , its head lowered , its two white horns gleaming their deadly significance . Nearer and nearer , 50 yards , 40 yards , 30 yards-crack ! a bullet sped from York 's rifle ... a perissodactyl monster lay dead ! <P> A good " bag " was expected , as the camp was surrounded by lions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zebra and a pallah ( antelope ) . The Duchess " bagged " a great collection of small game . <P> <P> York is aged 29-18 months younger than his eldest brother , Edward of Wales . In the affections of the British people he occupies a high place , but has nothing like the popularity of Wales . The Heir to the throne has to some extent forfeited the favor of the so-called upper classes by failing to take unto himself a wife and by endangering his life recklessly on the hunting field . To the people at large , however , he is as popular as ever , mainly owing to his democratic simplicity , his engaging manner .
