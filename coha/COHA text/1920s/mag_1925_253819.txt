There was several days ' warning that there was a scandal coming in regard to the effort to secure increased pay for postal employes . Last week the nature of the affair was revealed : <P> An assistant clerk of the Senate Post Office Committee was discharged . The Secretary of the House Postal Committee resigned . Six postal officials-the Acting Superintendent of Mails in New York City , the Acting Postmaster of <P> Detroit , the Assistant Superintendent of Delivery at Chicago , the Superintendent of Mails at Louisville , the Assistant Postmaster of Springfield , Ohio , the Postal Cashier at Boston-were suspended . A report of two Postal Inspectors who investigated the conduct of these men was made public . <P> The report declared that the Assistant Clerk of the Senate Committee secured the appointment of four of these men to assist in the preparation of the Postal Pay Increase Bill ( passed by Congress and vetoed by the President last spring ) , that they came to Washington and were approached by the clerk who asked to be paid for securing the passage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright but , as a blind , arranged to pay him $125 a month as a contributor to the magazine of the National Association of Postal Supervisors ( all six were members of the Executive Committee of this organization ) , that by this and subsequent arrangements the clerk expected to get $10,000 and actually got $2,585 , that the same group made a " present " of $1,000 to the Secretary of the House Committee . The accused men maintain the payments were perfectly proper , having been made to secure information and not to influence legislation . Bribery proceedings can not be instituted since the clerk and the Secretary are technically employed by the committees and are not U. S. officers . <P> Senator Ashurst described the disclosures as a smoke screen to cover the defeat of the Postal Pay increase bill and pointed out that the suspended men represent only the higher postal officials , some 5,000 in number , not the main body of postal workers . <P> Meanwhile , the Senate Post Office Committee completed work on the bill which is to provide increased postal rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was to be offered as a substitute for the measure ( vetoed by the President ) , which provided higher pay without corresponding rate increases .
