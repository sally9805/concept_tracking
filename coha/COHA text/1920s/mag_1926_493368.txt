He was silent for a few minutes as we fought our way up the crowded , slope of Fourth Avenue ; his cigar appeared to afford him a certain comfort . Finally he turned to me again with a sigh . " I do n't think you 'd be satisfied with one of those taxis , " he said . " They charge terrible prices ; not the regular tariff like we do . Those hotels have their own taxis ; we do n't get much hotel trade in our part of town . That 's the reason I never heard of that hotel ; you see we get mostly the apartment house trade . " " 1 see , " I said . " Please do n't be unhappy about it . There 's the Belmont at the corner of Park Avenue and Forty-second Street , on the left-hand side . " " You mean the red building , " he said . " That 's the corner of Forty-first . " " No , I do n't , " I said . " I mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the ' Bel ? mont was very visible in the blue October air . " You let me out on the other side of the street if you like . in a hurry , and you 'd have to turn . " " I can turn into Forty-first Street , if it 's that red build ? ing on the left , " he began , but I was forced to cut him short . The clock on the station told me that I was twenty minutes late for lunch , and I had forgotten to powder my nose after all . " But it 's the gray building ; I 'm sorry , but truly it is , " I said , pressing a clean dollar bill into his hand . " Goodbye ; I 'm so sorry , but I really must go . " " Well , the only reason I did n't know where that hotel was , you see , was because we do n't get much of this up ? town hotel trade down around Washington Square . . . " he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dived into the shining welter of traffic , that I had wounded his feelings by my going . -I wished that I had a moment in which to explain to him that I would n't take one of these hotel taxis back to Ninth Street . " Fifty Central Park West , " I said to the third taxi-driver one cold November evening , emerging from Marta 's in my new Poiret cloak . I was dining that night with a well known novelist ; the party was completely feminine , and William was not invited . He had very sweetly asked me to drink a cocktail with him while he ate his antipasto . Mr. Dunn who drove the taxi thought I had but just escaped from a haunt of vice . He looked at my golden cloak with distinct anxiety ; it had the glitter of the'wages of sin . " The traffic 's terrible , " he said to me when we turned into Sixth Avenue . He was a person of about my own age , with a pleasant round face , and both his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I agreed . " Do you think they 'll have to build an elevated bridge , perhaps ? " " Tunnels , more likely , but it 's worse every year and Gad alone knows what they 'll do about it , " he told me rather fiercely . " I have been twenty-five years in this town and every year I 've been thinking it could n't go on , not with the traffic like this . I come here when I was a little boy , and things is going from bad to worse every year I live . " " Did you come from Ireland ? " I asked , to cheer him up ; I knew quite well that he had . " I did that , from Tipperary , " he said more hopefully ; I refrained from remarking that it was a long way . " The Irish are a good people , not like these Italians , " he went on , and I saw that he was still worrying about my golden cloak and the haunts of vice . I wished I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that very moment . " You ca n't trust them Italians , not really trust ' em , " he said , wagging his head portentously . " The Irish are different ; they 're hospitable , but you can trust ' em all the same . Now you 'd never know when them Italians would get nasty . " I suppose he thought I had just been deceived by a dashing Neapolitan , and instead of that I had drunk one small bacardi cocktail with my own husband . " The Irish are a fine people , " he said . " There 's ' no hospitality like the Irish hospitality , ' and yet you can trust ' em . They have their religion , and while they 're fond of a bit of gaiety they 're great poets , some of ' em . The Irish have the greatest poets in the world . " " I know , " I said . " Yeats and A. E. and James Stephens and Padraic Colum . I know Padraic Colum ; he 's a friend of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Mr. Dunn . " He 's a great poet , to be sure . But you should go to Ireland ; there 's nothing like the real Irish hospitality . Have you never been to Ireland at all ? " " No , " I said . " Never . Is n't it a pity ? " " It 's a terrible pity , " he agreed . " There 's no place like Ireland , and no one like the Irish for hospitality . Not like them Italians now . . . you ca n't trust them Italians . " " No , " I said , " I suppose not ; I would n't dream of trusting them . " " No , " he said , " that 's right ; it would n't do to trust ' em . And have you no Irish blood at all yourself , then ? " " A little , " I admitted , as we drew up at the portals of Fifty Central Park West . " God be praised for that , " he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden cloak about me and disappeared between the gates of wreathed and foliated bronze into the marble halls beyond . In my own mind and my own manner , I was really praising God . THEN a comic history of American architecture comes to be written many of our new skyscrapers will have a prominent place . Their windy grandeur will be put alongside the solemn rococo of our Gilded Age mansions , the artful ruralism of country cottages thatched with bent shingles , and the awkward splendor of French chateaux in the midst of the Berkshires . The new Para ? mount Building in New York is an excellent specimen for these pages : the posters describe it as the greatest palace that shadows have built : but it is in fact the greatest shadow that shadows have built . Its exterior is a facade that no one can see : its interior is the reminiscence of a grandiose nightmare that might follow a rather arduous day of sight ? seeing in Paris . The setback skyscraper is rapidly turning out to be the great booby prize in American architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that building ordinances and ideal schemes by Mr. Hugh Ferriss can not take the place : of a genuine aesthetic command over the materials , struc ? ture , and site . New York possesses a handful of remark ? able skyscrapers ; and a few of these , like the Radiator Building and the American Telephone Building , can be seen ; beyond this handful , the less said about the aesthetic triumphs of the skyscraper the better : for one even soundly designed office building I am prepared to show a dozen more competent and interesting schools , factories and other low buildings . The people who see our architectural sal ? vation in the skyscraper know very little , I suspect , about either architecture or salvation . The new Paramount Building is no better or worse than a dozen other great structures which now shadow our streets ; so that an examination of its comic faux pas . need not be taken invidiously . If it becomes the butt of this parable , it is only because the building has singled itself out from the undistinguished mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended its com ? pletion : pullets cackle quite as loudly , without laying an egg . In the Paramount Building one finds not the faintest departure from a thoroughly low standard in design ; it is , indeed , a compact summary of all the prevailing faults in skyscraper building and in American decoration . Like many tall buildings , it has one point of undisputed distinction : it is a tall building . If bulk alone makes architecture , the Paramount is beautiful : if cubic capacity is an indication of aesthetic success , the Paramount building is a success . This skyscraper exhibits that " swaggering in specious dimensions " which Spengler regards as the sign of cultural impotence : how specious these dimensions are one gathers best from a vantage-point on the sidewalk level ; the set- , . backs give no sense from the bottom of either height or depth . The whole structure was ' conceived in two dimen ? sions : the one satisfactory view of it comes at a distance of twenty stories above the street , and three blocks away , immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site has a unique possibility : for the side of the building is on the axis of Broadway , for a distance of at least half a mile : unlike most of our buildings on gridiron streets , it can be approaches This unique possi ? bility was completely forgotten ; me e than that , it was absurdly misused , with the result ti it the upper stories rise against the sky , above Broadway , with the immense solidity of a slab of chewing gum . Now , even a two dimensional fa ? ade may redeeming features ; but I have looked again ? at the Paramount Building without discovering dull buff bricks , , the slight stone relief , have not even the distinction of interesting color or texture : compared with an out and out office building , like the new French Build ? ing on Forty-fifth Street and Fifth Avenue ? a building that makes a brave , if not always successful , effort at color ? the great palace of amusements wears a distinctly fune ? real air . Except for the blankness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the high opening above the marquee , glittering in the evening with a hint of inner splendor , there is no indication whatever that this building is supposed to be a perfect home for the newest and most native form of art , or that it houses , among other things , an immense theatre . The " hint of splendor " brings one to the theatre itself ; it lures one into an atmosphere of glare and glitter and bounce and style ? as " style " is conceived by people who find in the more vulgar aspects of the eighteenth century the mirror of their inmost hopes and desires . Mr. Albee set a pattern for this kind of decoration in his huge Brook ? lyn vaudeville palace : the Paramount has reproduced the lofty ceilings , the vast lounges , the carpets of such heavy ply that one is tempted to walk barefoot ; and it has gone Mr. Albee one better in that , while his Brooklyn theatre has reproductions of favorite Louvre postcard pictures , in the Paramount there are , if I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which harinonize in every way with the decorative effect . Great columns of almost marble : small panels of almost art : infinite lengths of carpet ? these things excite the popular Ahs ! and Ohs ! It is the grandeur of a Flatbush sunparlor , enlarged a thousand diameters . But people want magnificence and glitter , too ? I do not object , even to the glitter . What is wrong about the decorations in the Paramount Theatre is that this is , so to speak , such dull glitter . In Los Angeles there is a much more riotously vulgar movie theatre , vastly glittering , too : but the effects have not been achieved through tedious decorative cliches , and with all its sentimentality , the west ? ern theatre has also a little of the life and inevitable mod ? ernity of the movie ? a trivial and sentimental art , no doubt , at present , but not without an occasional gleam of aesthetic aptitude , or at worst , comic relief . There was no glimmer in the . designer 's mind , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an amusing way . The decora ? tion was achieved by formula : standard sample number so-and-so : so many dozen crystals , so many pounds of gilt , all according to specifications for sumptuousness , luxury , beauty , grandeur , warranted not to fail ? see Mr. Albee . All ! these decorations will not fail . To a generation thoroughly schooled in " art appreciation " by the art mu ? seum , the school , the woman 's club , the Sunday supplement , the style of the Paramount decorations will seem a true and beautiful thing : they will remember Versailles and the Hall of Mirrors , they will think of the Opera House in Paris ? so near to the American Express Company ? they will think of the Louvre itself , perhaps , and feel that America is a very wonderful place . Is there any elegance or beauty that we can not have , now that we can so emi ? nently pay for it ? I believe that a fine and modern scheme of decoration might have caused appreciative gasps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised in advance : but that would have demanded a little talent in the archi ? tect 's office ? and besides , it would have wasted hours and hours of certified art appreciation . The Paramount direc ? tors have in fact performed a service by providing this particular historical brand of magnificence . It remains for them to perform one more public benefit . They should borrow the Stuart Collection at the Public Library on permanent loan , and give these pictures the sort of setting they need . I have kept comment on the auditorium to the last ; for there the failure is partly the result of misplaced grandi osity , the habit of conceiving everything in a big way , whether the bigness be appropriate , as in a mountain , or a little inept , as in a wart at the end of one 's nose . A vast and towering prose , nium arch is flanked by two nar ? rower panels , inset win indirect lights : at the bottom of this enormous pile of space , smothered by both the height above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , is the screen itself , completely dwarfed and dimin ? ished , its own effect frustrated by both the division of space and the adjacent decorations . What could n't a modern ar ? tist with a cubist background do with such an opportunity ? What a chance to play with contrasting planes , cross lights , and mobile spots of color , without any superficial decor ? ative relief to spoil the strong effect of light itself . Mod ? ern art , the art of Bracque , Leger , Kandinsky , Man Ray , Stieglitz , has been a series of laboratory researches toward the understanding of such problems . Here was a place to apply a little of this new knowledge and taste ! The possibilities of modern art never occurred to the designers of the Paramount . On the contrary , their struc ? ture shows a complete paralysis of the imagination : it is dead in conception : it is dead in detail : its grandeur is feeble : it is the illusion of a great building . But I must not end this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the lavatories are well placed and of standard design : the internal traffic problems are ably handled . Let us take what creature comfort we can in these things . Brain : be silent ! Eye : be still ! SIR : We are appreciative of the New Republic 's recent editorial utterances on lynching , particularly the editorial comment on the investigation of the Aiken , S. C. , lynching conducted by the New York World . There is a slight omission in your editorial which , I am sure , you will wish to correct . The World has , as you say , been carrying on a most courageous and effective campaign of publicity but not a " single-handed " campaign . For the first inves ? tigator on the scene of the Aiken lynching was Walter White , Assistant Secretary of the National Association for the Advance ? ment of Colored People , who was sent there by this Association and who gave the World the facts which brought about the sending of Mr. Garrett to South Carolina . The investigation of the Aiken lynching by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brilliant series of articles in the World is part of our seventeen-year campaign against this evil . The Aiken atrocity offers an excellent example of the lynching spirit at its worst . SIR : It seems plain that the open season on Mr. Durant 's Story of Philosophy still obtains . Even your chaste interior pages continue to disparage it , presumably upon expert professional ad ? vice , although on the back cover you think better of it . ButI do not direct my fire particularly at you , but at the whole chorus of professional disapprobation which finds echoes wherever a reviewer 's column succeeds in smoking out some ofthe epistemological cenobites . It is familiar enough . It surges for every Outline that comes off the press . It is the natural resent ? ment and bewilderment of the painstaking mechanic when some wizard comes along and breathes incalculable life into the cadaver which he has been sombrely dissecting . This time the fault is profounder , because the subject is . Those who derogate Durant 's Story of Philosophy are those who would regard philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of all the intelligence and passion of life . The reason of this preference is not so recondite as one may imagine at first blush . It is only that if philosophy is an intricate and laborious little trade among other trades , it may be successfully and respectably cultivated by any dolt that cares to take the trouble ; whereas if it is imagination and poetry , faith and reality , the whole adventure of man 's heart and mind , then only geniuses can be philosophers , and there must be a woeful house-cleaning adown the buzzard roosts of Academia ! Mr. Durant may never , as a matter of fact , loom a stupendous figure through the perspective of the ages ; but he is being de ? tracted precisely because he is nearer to philosophic bigness than are his detractors . It is natural that his identification of Philosophy with the Love of Wisdom , with sympathy and humor , causes commotion among the impoverished souls whose tenure depends on the popularity of the assumption that the true scope of Phil ? osophy is memorizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the categories . It is persons of the temperament of Mr. Durant ? who is inter ? ested in life , who knows life , and who knows the spirit of phil ? osophy sufficiently well to aver repeatedly that " All philosophers agree " ? that may rescue man 's only important business , the busi ? ness of thought , from the universal disrepute into which it falls as the result of the quarrelsome trivialities of the little dialecticians . It is these chore-boys , each jealously engrossed in his metaphysical stint , who have contrived to see nothing but the minutia of dis ? agreement , and these everywhere , so that the opinion reigns that philosophy is petty , and that every philosopher contradicts every other philosopher , anyhow , so they must all be wrong from alpha to omega . They do n't , and they are n't . And Durant 's ebullient pages are almost the first to divulge this holy secret ! SIR : Will you be good enough to help us this year , as in the past , by spreading our appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more cash gifts may be made to our fel ? low workers in prison . Thus we can show to them that they are not forgotten , that we esteem their courage and fortitude . At Christmas money is especially welcomed by these imprisoned ; for at that time they are given permission to buy towels , candy and other comforts ordinarily forbidden them . In past years we have been able , through the generous contribu ? tions of friends , to send $25 to each prisoner ; we are eager to do as well this year . There are fifty-two prisoners to be remembered . These include thirty-nine members of the Industrial Workers of the World ? the eight Centralia victims , three fellow-workers imprisoned in Wash ? ington state under the criminal syndicalism law ; twenty-five others serving sentence in California on syndicalism charges , which means simply that they held membership in the I. W. W. , a legal organization everywhere else ; Mooney and Billings , Sacco and Vanzetti , and others . We also must remember the children who were scalded in the raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of these class war prisoners . Each contribution will be acknowledged with a numbered re ? ceipt .
