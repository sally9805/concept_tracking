JIPPING STREET-Childhood in a London Slum-Kathleen Woodward-Harpers ( $2.50 ) . Sanctioned by the crown , Author Woodward published last year Queen Mary of England , satisfactory biography . With lowlier matter and higher art she now records her dreary childhood before she was smiled upon by royalty . Jipping Street ends in a canal much patronized by suicides , and is flanked by breweries , tanneries , and jam factories , each with a unique smell that clashes with the sickly odor of chloroform wafted from the hospital below London Bridge . Here Kathleen 's mother supported six children and an invalid husband , scrubbing floors , working in a steaming washhouse . " Life kicks you downstairs and then it kicks you upstairs , " but her daughter refused to live by any such stoicism . By pretending to several more years than she had , she got her start in a collar factory , lives now in " The Temple , " distinguished retreat of barristers and litterateurs.                  @ @ @
