Mr. Reed . The thinly-populated Southwest echoed all week with the slow , formidable voice of Candidate Reed . Partly to overshadow Candidate Smith , partly to get credit for a party service , partly because he revels in smoldering oratory , Candidate Reed stuck close to his stock speech on G. O. P. " boodlers " and misdeeds , seasoned with a few peppercorns for Tammany Hall . At Dallas , he specially flayed Secretary Mellon . At Tulsa , his special text was Oil , his chief target the Tariff . At Topeka he fell upon President Coolidge and snarled : " Without hesitation I declare that the stratum of the Republican party which has for the past eight years controlled the government is the most corrupt , the most venal and the most vicious body of men by which this nation has ever been afflicted . " * At Denver it was " the snoopers and spies . . . like the lice of Egypt " - an anti-Prohibition speech ( Denver being wet ) . The League of Nations took a lashing , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here he said : " I expect someone to say that ' Reed is merely destructive ; he wants to destroy existing conditions . ' Of course ! Every time you want to change anything you must alter or destroy existing conditions . " Then he set up the Republican " crooks , grafters and scoundrels " again and once more flailed them down . Large audiences attend him everywhere . Everywhere he was applauded by the Hearst press , which admires President Coolidge and wants Secretary Mellon to succeed him , but whose owner is Candidate Smith 's implacable foe . <P> Mr. Lowden last week began the open season for saying " another county heard from " in its original context . Candidate Lowden heard from the 99 counties of Iowa and cornered a fat majority of 1,443 delegates chosen by cornland Republicans for the state convention . <P> Mr. Hoover . Candidate Hoover answered the Borah questionnaire on Prohibition by calling the latter " a great social and economic experiment , noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose " which he does not favor repealing and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sincerely . " It must be worked out constructively , " said Candidate Hoover , leaving public information about where it was . Clarence Darrow , cynic lawyer , tried to illuminate by announcing , in Cincinnati : " I do n't think Hoover is any drier than I am . I ought to know . I have had a drink with him . " <P> Candidate Hoover went before the Senate Commerce Committee and said that flood control , too , requires " a constructive solution . " He sided with the Administration for the principle of the states sharing the cost . He neatly , almost scornfully , eluded further quizzing by saying that the facts of the Mississippi Basin 's condition were not all known yet , and by declining to criticize " my colleagues in the Government . " Senator Willis , who had blustered so about how he would drag out the Hoover opinions at this hearing , sat silent and brooding while Senator Hawes put most of the questions .               @ @ @ @ @ @
