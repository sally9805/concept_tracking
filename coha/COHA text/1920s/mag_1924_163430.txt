The exhibitions of Aristide Maillol at the Whitney Studio Club and of Henri Matisse at the Brummer Gallery , both in Manhattan , show similar theories of art expressed respectively in sculpture and painting . While Sculptor Maillol is little known to Americans , artist Matisse 's crude nudes and restless still-lifes have long been flaunted before a sceptical public . <P> Maillol attempts a direct treatment of essential form and line in an effort to interpret the inner truth which he and Matisse strive to dissect . The distorted drawing and crude modelling is the result of artistic conviction , rather than inability to draw or chisel . <P> Says Matisse : " What I dream is an art of balance , of purity , of tranquillity . . . which shall be ... something comparable to a friendly armchair . "
