Pari nessuno con chi rappresenta il governo dello stato . <P> Mussolini <P> The above favorite maxim of Il Duce , that " No one may claim equality with him who represents the Government of the State , " was given peculiar legal force at a Cabinet meeting last week . Rapping for order , Il Duce presented a decree embodying the notorious " electoral reforms " recently proposed by the Fascist Grand Council ( TIME , Nov. 21 ) . <P> If passed , the measure would abrogate democratic suffrage in Italy , and create a new legislative Chamber almost solely controlled by appointive powers vested in Signor Mussolini .
