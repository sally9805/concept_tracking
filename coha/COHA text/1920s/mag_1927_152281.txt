Last week , for the second time in its entire existence , the Canadian Senate congratulated one of its members on the 100th anniversary of his birth by presenting him with a portrait of himself . The hoary Senator is the Honorable George Casimir Dessaulles of St. Hyacinthe ; his birthplace , Province of Quebec . <P> When Governor General Earl Grey appointed Mr. Dessaulles to the Senate in 1907 the centenarian was 79 years old . Loud &; long were the protests that he was " too " old . " Even some of the Senators complained to Premier Sir Wilfred Laurier . But the wily French Canadian statesman smiled and said : " He will be here when most of you are gone . " And , when Senator Dessaulles looks around the Senate at his slightly less hoary colleagues , he must admit that the prophecy has been fulfilled . <P> Canadian Senators are appointed for life and receive , if they attend three-quarters of the sessions , $4,000 a year . To all intents and purposes they are irremovable , which accounts for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be trundled to the Senate building in armchairs . <P> It is now 60 years ago since the Dominion Senate was established and for most of that period a movement to " end or mend the Senate " has been an annual slogan of Canadian politics . But the aged Senators have been so tenacious of office that they have resisted every effort at reform ; for , without their consent , nothing can be done to change the present constitution of that venerable house . <P> At present there are one centenarian , one nonagenarian , six octogenarians and many a septuagenarian in a Senate that numbers only 96 members .
