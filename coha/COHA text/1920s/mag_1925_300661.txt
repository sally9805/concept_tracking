The Copper and Brass Research Association has completed a survey on the building shortage in this country , of general interests to tenants , landlords , mortgage-holders . On Jan. 2 , 1920 , the shortage amounted to $10,750,000,000 ; and each year an additional amount of construction valued at sums starting at $3,000,000,000 and steadily increasing was likewise required to meet the normal growth of the country . <P> In the last five years about $23,500,000,000 has been spent for construction , as follows : <P> In 1920 ... $3,943,865,000 <P> In 1921 ... $3,442,300,000 <P> In 1922 ... $4,910,000,001 <P> In 1923 ... $5,922,900,000 <P> In 1924 ... $5,341,140,000 <P> Construction during the coming year is estimated at $4,000,000,000 which , according to the survey , will reduce the building shortage on Jan. 1 , 1926 , to only $400,000,000 . The survey concludes that the building industry gives several indications of slowing down . <P> Unfortunately , the construction of the past few years has been performed unevenly throughout the country , and with different classes of buildings . Thus , in some sections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in others there is an oversupply . In Washington , D. C , President Coolidge has felt it necessary to appoint a commission to fix rents . On the other hand , T. H. Green , former president of the Hotel Association fof New York City , has declared that more hotels are now being built than there is need for , and that this may bring on serious difficulties to the whole hotel industry . He recalled the dark days of 1903-04 , when one Manhattan hotel failed so often that the Sheriff had to board in it to fulfil his duties .
