On the evening of Feb. 19 Senator Sheppard , Texas Democrat , opened the final debate on the Administration Ship Subsidy bill with a seven-hour speech on the League of Nations . Similar arguments against the measure continued for more than a week until the bill was pronounced dead by Senator Jones , its manager . <P> This simple method of murdering a bill is called " filibuster . " Any senator can speak on any subject at any time at any length ; nothing can stop him but physical exhaustion . Friends and foes of the measure regard a filibuster as a sporting proposition . The object of the supporting side is to find a strategic error in the vocal armor of the filibusterers and obtain the floor to bring the measure to a vote . That happened several years ago to Senator LaFollette , who , after talking 18 hours , lost the floor and saw the bill passed in five minutes . <P> All the machinery of national politics was at work grinding away at President Harding 's ship measure . House Republicans held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the undaunted foes of subsidy talked on . Some of their speeches were : Senator Reed : " Purchase of the West Indies " ( four hours ) ; Senator Pomerene : " A Home for the Vice President " ( 12 minutes ) ; Senator Borah : " Recognition of Russia " ( two hours ) ; Senator McKeller : " Bureau of Engraving Dismissals " ( five and one-half hours ) . <P> After a week of that , Senator Jones surrendered . He begged to have the bill set aside as " unfinished business . " Its status now is exactly the same as in November , when the President called a special session to pass it . <P> The farm bloc in the Senate is credited with the death of the Subsidy .
