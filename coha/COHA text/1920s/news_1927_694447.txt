txt Rear Admiral Thomas P. Magruder , whom Secretary Wilbur yesterday relieved of his command of the Fourth Naval District , sent a letter today to President Coolidge , protesting against Mr. Wilbur 's order and asking the President to revoke it .

" Admiral Magruder spent the better part of the day in his office in the navy yard , where he was willing to discuss the detachment order in general terms , but not specifically . He chose to be facetious at times . He would make no comment whatsoever , he said , on the announcement of Secretary Wilbur that Rear Admiral Latimer , President of the General Board of the Navy , had been appointed to succeed him in command at the Philadelphia station . Neither would he comment on the possible fate awaiting him ' at the hands of his superior . Admiral Confirms Letter .

" I hope the order will be revoked , " he replied . That being said and done , the veteran of forty-two years in the navy closed his desk with a bang , locked it and announced he was going home to his wife . He entered his private car and was driven to his quarters . Another thing he said with considerable emphasis was that he considered his detachment from duty here a clear case of disciplinary measure for his articles and utterances re- garding the navy .

" This passage occurred in his office at the Navy Yard , during which he endeavored to bring a note of levity into the discussion . " You may say you found the Admiral seated in his office this morning perfectly normal and polite and hard at work on his papers as usual , " he told interviewers . " He stopped his work to say that his detachment  --  summary detachment  --  was a great surprise , and you know when a thing is done summarily it is pretty tough .

" It costs $16,000,000 to build a cruiser and 52,000,000 annually to run it . Great Britain 's cruisers were mainly built during the war , and it so happens that ours , built later , are larger . ship for ship , and I think it is fair that we have fewer . If Great Britain wants them , let her have them . " I was told to be brief , but when I get talking about the navy I love it so dearly I never know when to stop . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
