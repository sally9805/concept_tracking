TAKE our hand and conic with us on a trip through a letter we got this morning in the mail . Remember that this is the golden age of ballyhoo , an age of extraordinary hookups , when the left hand not only knoweth what the right hand doeth but helpeth it along . Remember that it is an age when every anthem is a theme song . Now open this letter with us and examine the latest hook-up , between New York University and the Literary Digest . A merger of mergers . The envelope , as you see , bears the exciting legend : " Henry Cook Hathaway , Director of Public Information , New York University . " A letter from N.Y.U. ! Slash right and left with the paper cutter , let there be no delay I Now then , here we go : a lung communication from Mr. Hathaway , written on the Bureau 's letterhead . The letterhead mentions , among other things , that N.Y.U. has 37,000 students , 1,600 faculty members , occupies 50 acres of campus in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the home of the Hall of Fame . But enough of that  --  to the body of the letter ! " Dear Reader : How would you like to share in the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream that will eventually make you more money , finer friends , increase your mental efficiency , and broaden your life ? And all without cost to you ? " We are getting along swimmingly . The first paragraph of a letter from the Director of Public Information of New York University : dreams of ( 1 ) money , ( 2 ) friends , ( 3 ) culture , presumably in the order named , and all without cost .

Have you courage , and a tight enough grip on our hand , to follow down to where a new character comes into the letter , in the person of Dr. William Seaver Woods ? Hang fast , we must go on ! Says the letter " I told my friend , Dr. William Seaver Woods , well-known editor-in-chief of the Literary Digest , of this idea . He became most enthusiastic .

Ca n't you stay with us long enough to read how you send no money ( it would spoil N.Y.U.

" " Madame Curie  --  you know  --  the lady that invented the radio . " Solo Flight ATIATION has a big plate-glass show window in Fifty-seventh Street ( 27 West ) , which swings inward on hinges . It was opened some weeks ago to admit the St. Louis Robin , the plane that stayed up for eleven hundred hours , or whatever it was , and that now takes up a good part of the showroom space inside . You can see the mattress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on the cockpit walls , to keep track of what day and month it was , and other small sightsMore people stand outside and stare through the glass than go inside . They stare mainly at a toy plane on a small table just inside the window . At one end of the table is a big wind machine , and at the other end a chair . You can sit in the chair , reach under the table , and take hold of a regulation stick and throttle ; with your feet you can operate a regular rudder-bar . The throttle makes the wind machine go . The rudder-bar and stick are connected with the plane , and , when you manipulate them , miniature ailerons and rudders on the toy work exactly as they do on a big plane . All that is now needed to make the plane actually fly is to get up a ground speed of seventy miles an hour  --  the speed at which this ship rises in the air . The inventor of this toy finally solved that problem  --  and the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the wind machine blows upon the plane at the rate of seventy miles an hour . Then you pull back your stick , as in a real plane , and up she goes , rising on an oiled and lightly balanced piston rod . By working your ailerons you can make it bank ; decrease the wind velocity , and the ship makes a graceful landing . It 's exactly the same as flying except you do n't go up with the ship ; which is , in its way , a big advance . The device is used in the Curtiss Flying Service 's ground schools to give student pilots preliminary training and , in this store , to stimulate sales . Any visitor is permitted to make the thing go . The wind machine roars so loudly , however , that big crowds gather . One layman we saw was so flustered by his audience that he shut off the wind and crashed . He was pale , but unhurt . In such emergencies a young lady attendant takes the pilot 's seat and manipulates the little plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a popular toy .

The Chase AAmerican woman , who lives in Paris , was driving her car very fast along the Boulevard Haussmann . ' This disturbed the composure of a gendarme who was walking along deep in thoughts on life . " /hors , olors , dors ! " he cried , and gestured the car to a standstill . He then demanded of the lady what she meant by driving at such a rate . Thinking fast , she explained she was pursuing her husband and another woman , who were in a car ahead . The gendarme stood out of her way . " After them , madame , " he said , gallantly waving her on . Old , Expensive Strings WURLITZER 'S keeps the Rodman Wanamaker collection of rare old violins , violas , double basses , and ' cellos , which it lately acquired , in a room with stained-glass windows through which Forty-second S tree t looks warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth more than half a million . We were told that Mr. Wanamaker THE NEW YORKER intended to build up a symphony orchestra of his own , in which only exceedingly valuable old instruments would be played . When he died he was about to begin collecting the finest old woodwinds and brasses available . The priceless strings will not lie unused , however , but will be played in concert , and also privately , by famous musicians . It has long been a custom of Kreisler , Heifetz , and others , when they are in town , to visit the stained-glass room and play old fiddles for their own pleasure  --  and that of the Wurlitztr curator , Mr. Jay Freeman , authority on violins , and no mean fiddler himself . He played a hundred-thousand-dollar Guarnerius for us . The store 's collection of famous instruments is now one of the finest in the world . It includes a ' cello which belonged to Napoleon , and which bears scars said to be the marks of his spurs . He did n't spur into the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kicked it . By lucky chance we ran into Henry Ostrovsky at 1Vurlitzer 's , demonstrating a curious machine which looks like the works of a music box . It is used for exercising , stretching , developing , etc. , the hands of musicians . In the past , several such machines have rather more harmed than helped delicate fingers , Ostrovsky 's seems to he a success . He worked thirty years to perfect it , only to have his first machines seized by the Germans , just as the war started , and used in hospitals to limber up crippled hands . This finally worked to the inventor 's advantage ; for after the war , the success that German doctors had with the device got noised around . It was used by hospitals in England and finally here . Dr. H. M. Lyle , of New York , tried the thing out with some skepticism and found that it worked wonders with old contractures of the fingers . It has been used at St. Luke 's Hospital for two years . It was an airplane manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country  --  and paid him a thousand dollars a month for daily exercises , personally supervised , to keep his hands in condition . That 's Ostrovsky 's regular price now . Patients , or students , are n't numerous , however . The inventor has done little to push the contraption on a big scale . A teacher of music in West Eighty-sixth Street has charge of renting out the machines . They are not sold outright . We mentioned they would likely go big in athletes ' training camps , where hands are always being bunged up , but Mr. Ostrovsky was n't interested . He would rather work on musicians , Auer , Godowsky , Elman , Zirnbalist , and others , have praised his machine and he is happy . He has studied musicians ' hands , particularly violinists ' , for forty years and could tell which was Kreisler 's , which Liman 's , etc. , if he saw all the famous ones thrust through a curtain . Once , in London , he examined the hands of more than ninety musicians , unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man played , missing only once or twice . He says Heifetz has the most accurate hand of any living violinist because , without ever making a slip , he can place all his fingers precisely at the right spot on the strings . Other violinists occasionally have to " slide into " the right spot . Kreisler is the deftest at this sliding in , because of his remarkable ear . He GAND.r.ft reu can detect an inaccuracy and correct it so swiftly that no one knows he was about to go a bit wrong . Juvenilia ON the occasion of his son 's tenth N. -- 1 birthday , a friend of ours sent the boy ( who was at his grandmother 's ) a gift . Later he received a thank-you letter . The letter contained appreciative phrases , a certain amount of local news , and ended on a reminiscent note . " I wish , " it ended , " I was nine again . " This is the same young man who once was taken to a hospital with his sister to have tonsils nut . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Each was allowed by the mother to take along one toy . We forgot what the little girl took , but we can never forget what the boy took . Roller-skates . Tac-a-Tac AA CERTAIN amount of sword-1- play goes on in town , even today . Walter Hampden , defender of Cyrano 's white plume , is an expert fencer . Nickolas Moray , the photographer , is a distinguished amateur and once got hit by a turnip at a bout . John Barrymore is another good fencer . The sword , in fact , is far from being in disuse : witness the New York Fencers ' Club , which has recently put up a fifteen-story apartment building at 320 East Fifty-third Street to perpetuate the spirit of knighthood and the Crusades . This club , we were interested to learn , is the oldest fencing organization in the world . It was founded in 1883 . ( The Sword Club of London is second oldest . ) Although swordsmanship will not be a qualification for residence in the new clubhouse in Fifty-third Street , there are enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there will probably always be a certain amount of desultory sword-play up and down the halls . Holding forth on the first floor , for a certainty , will be the venerable Martin Capdevielle , oldest active fencer in New York , who will dominate the salle d'arines with his jokes , his flashing steel , and his bushy white mustache . Capdevielle came to the club forty-five years ago as an instructor , and is still giving lessons , among his pupils being Colonel Henry Breckinridge , once Olympic fencing captain and now better known as Lindbergh 's lawyer . Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish likes to fence . So does Gutzon Borglum , the sculptor . Others that we have heard about are Dr. Graeme Hammond , the neurologist ; Fred R. Coudert , the lawyer ; Hudson Budd , the haberdasher ; Colonel Robert M. Thompson , the big International Nickel man ; Eugene Higgins , of American Tel . &; Tel. ; and Leo Nunes , president of the Leghorn Trading Company , of Pearl Street , who is the greatest American fencer and who has held fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained by the professional , Louis Senac , on of the illustrious Regis Senac and himself a fine figure in the world of sabre , foils , and epee . M. Senac has a dusty little salle at 354 ' West Fifty-seventh Street ( no sign on the door ) . Fencing is his life  --  a somewhat difficult enthusiasm to maintain among actor pupils , most of whom take their instruction in a perfunctory spirit because they feel they owe it to themselves . They have n't , as M. Senac says , " the love , " and many of them quit as soon as they 've learned to stand properly and make a couple of stock parries . Among his yellowing autographed pictures of the Harrimans , the teacher stands , tall , gray , and solemn , chiding aspiring swordsmen fur a bent arm or for failing to make the riposte truly tae-a-tae , while his little dog Touche quietly chews the buttons off the couch . M. Senac is one of the few professionals in this country who have dared to fight in public competitions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Sanges , in 1923 , that the turnip was thrown at Mr. l'iuray , who was one of the judges . Somebody thought things were n't going right . Besides the New York Fencers ' Club , there are three others  --  the %Vashington Square Fencers ' , the club of the N.Y.A.C. , and the J. Sanford Saltus Club in the French Y.M.C.A. Pleasant Evening F , VERY year about this time , an el- derly bachelor of East Sixtieth Street is host to a group of his young nieces from Toledo , who come here to see the sights , and to have one nice theatre box-party . This last is quite a trial , since the girls ' parents insist they must attend only shows of a moral and educational nature . There have been seasons when the old gentleman had to compromise by taking them for a nice walk . This year came near being one of them  --  until the uncle learned that students at Columbia University were giving an historical drama about the American Revolution . He called his ticket agency and explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man asked the old gentleman if he was quite sure that was the show he wanted tickets for . He was assured there was no mistake . There was , though . It was the agency 's . They thought the customer wanted tickets for the Columbia Burlesque Theatre and that is where the young ladies and their chaperone , a middle-aged dean of women , went . She had quite a time getting them to leave after the first act , or they her . We 're mixed . Two People MOW that Jefferson Market is on its last legs , Pratt 's book shop two blocks away becomes even more of a landmark than ever . Buying a book there is almost our favorite diversion . " What is it you want ? " asks Mrs. Pratt , looking up viciously from her darning as you squeeze through the door . She is mending socks . After you 've told her that you want " The Hunting of the Snark , " she says , " Well , I do n't think I can find it ; Papa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can find the book if you can get her to quit darning . Finally she gets up , discovers the hook almost immediately from among the half million volumes on the shelves , and then carefully writes the name of it down on a little piece of yellow paper so Papa Pratt can send for another copy right away . The Pratts would have a ft if their stock of five hundred thousand books was reduced by so much as one . You probably know the store  --  a narrow , weatherbeaten little doorway in Sixth Avenue near Eleventh , over which hangs a dirty awning bearing the legend : " Any Pretty Card . " The small windows are opaque with books and pamphlets and signs , and the doorway is made almost impassable with stalls . The Pratts , Mamma and Papa , have kept the shop forty years , and grown gray keeping it . They have books you ca n't find anywhere else and could n't find there if you had to look yourself . Mr. Pratt , wearing a beret , is usually in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He adheres to the old tradition ; modern jackets mean nothing to him  --  only one or two does he put in his window . Most of the display consists of brochures , greeting cards , dog-eared pamphlets , and technical books , for which Mr. Pratt writes his own blurbs on the margins of the dust covers . Thus you find a little book , " Efficiency Through Concentration , " with Mr. Pratt 's pencilled notation : Concentrate and you can accomplish anything . Or you find " What Your Dream Meant , " with Mr. Pratt 's quiet warning : Lathes need this . Or , right next to it , " Hair Dressing and Tinting , " with the sage advice : Start a beauty parlor ; there 's money in it . THE shop has what is reputed to be the largest collection of Irish literature outside of Dublin . So infinitely varied is its stork that large houses , like Brentano 's and Scribner 's , sometimes send down there for a rare book , and usually get it . Lafcadio Hearn used to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So did Kate Douglas Wiggin , Robert Chambers , before he published anything , S. Parkes Cadman , when he was preaching at the old Metropolitan Tcmple , and David Belasco , before Lenore Ulric was born . Faces change in the Tillage , but the Pratts go on forever . Mr. Pratt always takes two turns around Washington Square before lunch , and Mrs. Pratt skips rope one hundred and sixty times on arising . At irregular intervals a closed-forrepairs sign appears on their shop . This means only that the Pratts are off for Bermuda or Europe . They are very independent . They stay away as long as they like : business begins again right where it left off , the minute they reopen the store . Victim and Victor THE New York Bar Association has printed in its journal a note warning lawyers against a certain swindler whose racket is an old one . Matter of fact , we exposed it when manufacturers were the victims . At that time the attorneys chuckled . Now they affably receive the saint personable fellow , who passes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange a separation agreement for a couple he knows . Ile explains this is out of his own line .

ANOTHANOTHER racket , which is meeting ER a lot of success , came out during a conversation at the University Club the other night . A Mr. Floyd R. Cadwalader related how a pleasant young mechanic had visited his office and displayed a union card bearing , oddly enough , the same name  --  Floyd Cadwalader . This second Mr. Cad-. walader , it appeared , was in desperate straits had a job here , and so on , but had n't yet made enough money to bring his family on from Cleveland , and now a daughter had fallen sick out there , and so forth .
