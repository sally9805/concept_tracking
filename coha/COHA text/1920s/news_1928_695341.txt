txt If Peking were New York , the best way to prevent , girls from bobbing their . hair would be to ? pass a law making it mandatory . Peking has enacted such a law and intends to see that it is enforced . The reason is that many of the young ladies Of the Imperial City persist in dressing their hair according to the old Manchu style . Following the program of . the Chinese Nationalists , the Peking leaders wish to eradicate all traces of the days of the old China and by decree to abolish customs that have their roots in : a distant past . Among . other symbols ' of the departed era are the gorgeous yellow tiles on the roofs of the buildings within the Forbidden City . These , it is reported , are to be removed , so that no traces will remain to express to the Chinese people the conception of past glory under the Manchu dynasty .

The deadly monotony of the white man 's . " coat and ' pants . " and the slightly varied monotony of European ladies ' dresses must spread throughout most ' of the- world outside of Asia . There are plaCes- where , as in the Philippines , tribes like the Igorots dispense with trousers but retain the coat . Elsewhere they give up coats and shirts .. In China many of the younger men , although wearing the ancestral dress , omit the round hat and wear Western-made felt fedoras . However strong the desire to wipe out the traces of the Manchu emperors , it is hardly necessary to eradicate the ? styles and customs of countless generations and to put in their place the commonplaceness. pf the ' West .
