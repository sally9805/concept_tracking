Defense Minister General Wilhelm Groener made a bristling , characteristic speech to the Reichstag , last week , roundly declaring that " the present alarming increase in suicides among German soldiers " is directly due to a clause in the Versailles Treaty which prevents Germans from enlisting in the Reichswehr for a period of less than twelve years . <P> The intent of the treaty is of course to make it impossible for Germany to use her small army as a training school for warriors , something which might easily be done if quick turnovers in enlistment were allowed . <P> Fulminating against the twelve-year term , General Groener cried : " It is inhuman ! Our young men enter the army enthusiastically , but after two or three years many begin to get restless under the necessarily strict discipline . Being unable to obtain a discharge the men become morose and despondent , with the result that some end their lives in fits of insanity . "
