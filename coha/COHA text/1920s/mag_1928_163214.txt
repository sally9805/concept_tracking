In a small room of the Kremlin Hospital , Moscow , Big Bill Haywood died last week . <P> <P> William Dudley Haywood had been born 59 years ago in another small gloomy room , the kitchen of a mining cottage in Salt Lake City where his father worked . When he was nine , Bill Haywood was sent to work digging coal ; this he disliked , so a few years later he was bound out to a farmer . Bill Haywood ran away from the farm , did some prospecting , became a Socialist . In 1899 , when the Coeur d ' Alene , Idaho , striking began , he was chairman of the executive committee of the Western Federation of Miners . Seven years later he was the defendant in a trial that made his name famous in the U. S. as it increased the fame of Clarence S. Darrow , who defended him , and that of a local Idaho politician , William Edgar Borah who prosecuted him . <P> The facts briefly were these . In the bloody guerilla battling that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out the state militia , who , using unquestionably brutal means had succeeded in beating down the equally murderous members of the Federation . Steunenberg was the target for the miners ' rage ; in 1906 he was the target for a bullet that killed him . Haywood with two others was held for the murder ; the news of the trial filled the press and three names filled the news . Most of all , Haywood , the thick-lipped , scarfaced , foul-mouthed friend to every man in the world who had to work like a slave ; Darrow , the gentle , sorrowful , immensely kind , and immensely clever Chicago lawyer ; and Borah , lofty , muscular , and furious , who hated Haywood not because he hated radicals , but because he thought Haywood had killed or helped to kill a brave and faithful man . <P> The history of that trial in the newspapers of 1906 and 1907 is worth reading . The prosecution addressed 150,000 words to the jury , the defense used 250,000 . Everyone rather expected Borah to win . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who later admitted killing Governor Steunenberg made some absurd charges against Haywood which discredited his earlier incriminations . Haywood was freed after 18 months in jail , a famous man and to all dissatisfied workmen a hero . <P> The Idaho lawyer who might have dropped back into the dusty puddle of state politics after his glorious defeat went on to Washington , to Congress , to the Senate , to a great portion of respect and honor . Clarence Darrow every year more saddened by wrongs as untouchable as stars , could do not better than go on defending queer men , among them , two pale , sadistic murderers and a country school teacher . Big Bill Haywood took advantage of his fame . He organized the I. W. W. " We are the roughneck gang , " he said . When the War came he refused to fight .
