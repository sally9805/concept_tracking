Endurance Attempts . Of a flock of aspirants towards new refueling endurance records , one at Houston , Texas , another at Shreveport , La. , each managed to keep aloft more than 100 hours last week . A third , a Curtiss-Robertsoh at St. Louis , had been up more than 200 hours , flew on into this week hopeful of passing the 246-hour record . <P> Stultz Drunk ? After Wilmer Stultz was killed , a medical examination , ordered by the District Attorney of Nassau County , Long Island , disclosed sufficient alcohol in his brain to indicate that he was drunk at the time of his crash ( TIME , July 8 , 15 ) . Last week a Justice of the Peace , acting as Coroner , held an inquest . The autopsy evidence was not offered in evidence . Witnesses who were close to Stultz before his fatal flight said they did not consider him drunk then . So the Coroner 's decision was that Stultz died of a broken neck while doing a " falling leaf . " <P> Airvia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its long-planned seaplane service between New York and Boston with American Aeronautical Savoia-Marchetti seaplanes .

Yancey , after the trans-Atlantic flyers ( TIME , July 15 ) , both members of the firm . <P> Super Super-Whale . An early morning sun glittered on Lake Constance , Switzerland . Hundreds of people along the shore at Altenrheim eyed a fabulous structure at the water 's edge-a yacht-like thing beneath a single wing 157 ft. wide . Above the wings were six turrets supporting six pairs of tandem motors . Mechanics , climbing up through the turrets , inspected the motors . Below the mono-wing on each side was a float like the half wing of a sesquiplane . The great structure was the mighty enlargement of Dr. Claude Dornier 's Super-Whale , which he had been secretly building for two and a half years . Its flying capacity was 100 passengers . It was going on its trial runs . Dr. Dornier , usually self-contained and impassive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He gave a signal . The crew of 16 took their posts , the twelve motors thundered . The enormous flying boat slid out with ponderous ease across the glassy water after taxiing about for practice , the helmsman circled back for another signal , opened the throttles wide . After a run of 30 seconds , the gigantic ship lifted clear of the lake and flew . Dr. Dornier bursting with excitement and relief , said : " It is going to be a wonderful flying machine . " He is looking for a buyer .
