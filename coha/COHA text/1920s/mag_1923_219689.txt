The Government sustained a defeat in the House of Commons by seven votes over grievances concerning the treatment of ex-service men . Major Boyd-Carpenter , Minister of Labor , said that all questions relative to ex-service men would be considered by a committee . The House , however , evinced its dislike of committees by defeating the official motion " that the House do now go into committee of supply on civil service estimates . " <P> Two days later an uproar occurred in the House at question time , inspired chiefly by the defeat of the Government on the question of treatment of ex-service men . When Bonar Law entered the House , ironical cheers greeted him from the Labor benches . Conservatives , not to be outdone , brought their vocal chords to play in opposition to the Laborite jeers . Peace was restored to the House a little later ; but on the appearance of Major Boyd-Carpenter to answer questions , the House once more resounded with boos and shoos . It is common knowledge that the gallant major looks like a " guilty schoolboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conscious of the resemblance , boomed out : " Hold your hand out , you naughty boy .

" It started by an insistance from the Labor benches that Mr. Bonar Law , the Premier , answer questions personally . This he was unable to do , owing to his throat trouble . A statement to this effect was a signal for a general outburst of Laborite fury . The Red Flag was sung , and the uproar became so terrific that the Speaker was compelled to adjourn the session . In the general exit a good deal of inadvertent jostling occurred . One Laborite complained that he had been hit by a Conservative , whereupon Colonel the Hon. Walter E. Guinness ( Under Secretary of State for War ) , who seems to have been perfectly innocent , received a punch on the nose . <P> The Labor Party in general has severely criticized those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is understood that the members who resorted to singing the Red Flag afterwards apologized to the party . <P> The following day the Labor benches were quieter than usual and the Government proposal to relegate to committee the grievances expressed on behalf of ex-service men was carried by 242 to 135 votes . <P> An official statement issued from 10 Downing Street stated that Bonar Law has no intention of resigning the Premiership .
