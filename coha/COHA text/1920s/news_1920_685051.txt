Talley , Chief Assistant District Attorney , when asked if a lawyer was privileged to confer with a client whom he knew to be a fugitive from justice under an indictment for felony , said : When a lawyer has knowledge of the whereabouts of a client who is under indictment and wha IA a fugitive , he is permitted to avail himself of a reasonable time in which to try to arrange for bail before surrendering the fugitive . Of course that does not mean keeping him concealed for weeks . But it is not unethical to try to arrange to have ball so that his client will not have to be detained unnecessarily in prison .
