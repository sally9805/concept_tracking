By the Grace of God and by the recently expressed will of 78% of her 250,000 subjects , the Grand Duchess Charlotte , 32 , reigns and rules over Luxembourg . Her richly wooded and softly meadowed realm dozes complacently between Belgium and Germany . Her capital , the City of Luxembourg , rises aloof and serene upon a small plateau . Her mild and irreproachable consort is Prince Felix de Bourbon-Parma . Last week a dire project was under way to introduce into this quiet Eden a prodigious roisterer , a mighty brawler , a veritable Serpent-Man . <P> This creature is one Alexander Dvorjanin Zubkov , 27 , a Russian adventurer of no profession who sensationally wooed and married , last fall ( TIME , Nov. 28 ) , the Princess Victoria zu Schaumburg-Lippe , 61 , rich and eccentric sister of one-time Kaiser Wilhelm II . <P> Once married and supplied with funds , Adventurer Zubkov neglected his Princess and began in Berlin a boozily epic career . He playfully but painfully tweaked the noses of tardy waiters . He smashed and exploded bottles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effervescent golden rain . . . . And very often Alexander Dvorjanin Zubkov roistered with from six to ten ladies of the evening until high noon . <P> When it was seen that the Princess zu Schaumburg-Lippe continued to supply Debauchee Zubkov with funds and seemed to dote upon his antics , the German Government proceeded recently to expel him from the Fatherland on the ground that he has no valid passport . Since then he has been in Brussels , Belgium , still wineing and womening without stint , but under threat of momentary expulsion . Thus a problem has been set before doting Princess Victoria-where shall her Zubkov now roister , tweak , and make champagne-rain ? <P> Last week despatches told that Her Grand Ducal Highness , Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg , had been besought to give Zubkov sanctuary . She had received , it was said , a personal and impassioned plea from the doting wife who is , after all , the sister of a onetime German Emperor . Would Grand Duchess Charlotte , 32 , sympathize with Princess Victoria , 61 ? <P> Despatches finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit Serpent-Man Zubkov to enter and reside in her Eden , but solely on condition that he prove himself capable of respecting the public peace . <P> " Alexander is improving , " said Princess zu Schaumburg-Lippe , last week . " All we want to do is to go somewhere where we can live in peace . . . . "
