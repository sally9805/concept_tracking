QUIET CITIES-Joseph Hergesheimer-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . With a keen sense for things past , Hergesheimer revives the life of early American cities , immortalizing forgotten airs and manners in a prose of intricate beauty . His leisurely preface regrets the noise and bustle that have superseded simplicity . That done , he reverts to the thrilling intensity of Java Head , and recounts in a series of story-sketches the drama within quiet cities . In Albany Angenietje defies the customs of a stodgy Dutch community by marrying a British ensign who had survived Ticonderoga . At Natchez a steamboat card sharp turned respectable , acquired a Southern gentleman 's plantation , only to lose it through the backbiting of a jealous mulatto woman .
