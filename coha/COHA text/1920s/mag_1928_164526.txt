TENNIS-Helen Wills-Scribners ( $2.50 ) . Champion Wills ' game misses monotony by the power and deadly accuracy of her one great stroke . Failing the power , Author Wills ' book is deadly in its repetitious monotony . A little editing would have cut from page 15 the description of her first forehand drive described in almost the same one-syllable words on page 5 , or from pages 8 , 25 , 108 , the repeated precept of playing only two sets at a time and stopping though keen to go on to the third . <P> But no editing could delete the copybook banalities : moderate exercise ( tennis ) spells health , health spells good complexion ; nor improve the laborious heaping up of sentences that recall Freshman compositions in which every preposition helped to attain the required thousand words . In this case the required 214 pages contain the usual directions for shifting the weight from the right to the left foot ; a lucid diagram of the centre theory ( advising for net play a deep ball centre , which opens up less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; repeated admonitions to practice " for is it not so in everything-the more one learns the more one realizes there is still more to learn ? " ; and 32 drawings by the author of various tennis stars in action . These drawings are reminiscent of photographs one has seen of the stars in question , and have therefore caught realistic and characteristic motion . <P> For the rest , one learns that Author Wills requires three new balls a set though she remembers the time when she was " delighted with any ball as long as it would bounce . " - She once realized in a tournament that something was wrong , but did not discover until after the match that her opponent was left-handed. - Her " Poker Face " ( " a point I have never before discussed " ) is due to concentration rather than , as popularly supposed , lack of emotion. - When they pinned the Phi Beta Kappa key over her fast-beating heart she experienced one of the happiest moments of her life. - All players who have turned professional she mentions in the pluperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bounding Basque , " Betty Nuthall one of the best liked visitors we ever had , Seorita de Alvarez the most fascinating figure of the courts , this is as far as she betrays the inside knowledge she must have of the dramatic personnel of the tennis world .
