txt Under the " Act to increase the efficiency of the army " approved Feb. 14 , 1903 , " all officers detailed in the " General Staff Corps shall be detailed therein for periods of four " years , unless sooner relieved : " This provision applies to the Chief of Staff himself . It is proposed in the Senate Army Reorganization , bill to make : General ** PEnsHiNo Chief of Staff for as long a period ' as he remains upon the active list of the army , which Will be in. the natural course of things until Sept. 13,1924 . If General - PEnsHirm were made Chief- of Staff pow he would have about . four years and eight months to serve in the office should the Senate Army Reor-ganization bill become a law with the . provision affecting him a part of it . Secretary BAKER has asked the tary Affairs Committee to eliminate the provision , and he gives some cellent reasons . General PERSHING 'S period of service would be only a few Months longer than - the term of four years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- extra time , it may ' be asked ; if the purpose is to honor . him for his great work In France ? A principle is involved with which Congress should not interfere . Secretary BAKER , who is an admirer of the General and estimates his war services at their true value , says : Congress should not by legislation attempt to fix his status , ' or that of any other officer . It is extremely impolitic legislation . It Is an ' interference ' with the function of the Com " : manCler in Chief of the army . Suppose Congress were to . designate this and that officer for particular functions ; very soon the Commander in Chief would have no function whatever . ELIHU ROOT was Secretary of War when the general Staff was created by the law . Of 1903 . Mr. ROOT said of the new post and its responsibilities : For the. : , successful performance of his duties ' the Chief Of Staff must have the ' entire confidence of his comMandel .. In proportion as he merits that - confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice usually . accepted , and really to exercise the authority of his commander , subject only to the most general directions , just as VON MOLTKE . exer'cised the authority of King WILLIAM of Prussia as his Chief : of Staff . Secretary ROOT did . not overstate the Confidential relations of the Chief of Staff and the President ; and Mr. BAKER is on unassailable ground when he says that " - the Chief of Staff " should be a man of tlYe President 's own.selection and removable at any time he - saw fit . " An : - incoming President may appoint to the office a successor to the General serving at the time . It is the expectation that a change will be made . President WILSON did not , however , exercise his Prerogative when he went to Washington . General LEONARD WOOD had been Chief of Staff for more , than two ; years ; and he continued to serve until April , 1014 . The President who is in7 augurated on March 14 , 1921 , should be allowed to select his Chief of Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in General PERSHING 'S interests is retained the new President must recognize him as Chief of Staff and enter ' into confidential relations with him . This might be embarrassing , and it IS conceivable that the welfare of the army would not be promoted . The ? president is not a fixture ; why should his subordinate in the army , of which the President is Commander in Chief , be a fixture and enjoy a longer term ? It is a question that should not be difficult to answer . The plan , if adopted , to make General PERSHING Chief of Staff until he retires from the army would be a precedent which might be followed some day by bestowing the office upon a famous soldier of fifty , who would have fourteen years to serve , and then people might feel the shadow of mill : , tarism falling over them . Honorable work can be found for , General PER . SHING , and he is not the man to shirk it . Secretary BAKER offers the timely , proposal that the General be made head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy , a position of use fulness such as Admiral DEWEY filled in connection with the General Board of the Navy .
