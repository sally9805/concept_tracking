Six years ago Claire Ulrich , chorus girl met Charles E. Whitehurst , Baltimore . Md. , theatreman , in Manhattan . They went to a hotel . In their room , without witnesses , they read to each other the marriage service from a prayer book , exchanged vows . On page 449 the girl wrote " Claire " and then " Charles . " As man and wife they lived together briefly . <P> Less than a year later Whitehurst died , leaving an estate of $280,000 and no will . Last week the Maryland Court of Appeals decided that this marriage was valid under the laws of New York , that Claire Ulrich was , by common law , Mrs. Whitehurst . As his widow , and over the objections of his mother and brothers , she was entitled to administer and share in his estate . <P> In 1911 , Carlton Curtis , 43 , a rich bachelor , was standing at the corner of 54th Street and Broadway , Manhattan , when he saw an automobile bearing down recklessly upon a 17-year-old Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lithe and vivacious , befriended her . She said her name was Letitia Ernestine Brown . For her he bought a small house in Freeport , L. I. , where , she said , he solemnly took her hand , declared himself her husband and her his wife . On her he settled a secret fund of $250,000 . About Freeport the two were known as Mr. and Mrs. Harry Brown . Six months of each year Mr. Curtis traveled alone in Europe . Some of the money which he gave her she spent upon a Negro man whose wife threatened court action unless much more money was forthcoming . The triangle crashed and last year Letitia Ernestine Brown sued Mr. Curtis for separation and $250 per week alimony , claiming she was his common-law wife . A Manhattan judge decided their relationship was purely meretricious and illicit , dismissed the suit . Mr. Curtis , declaring his " life was ruined , " vanished " to get away from it all . " <P> Between these two cases , as in a twilight zone , lies the treacherous field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a legal union from the lover-mistress relationship . <P> States by statutes have decreed who shall be competent to marry , what persons shall be competent to perform marriage ceremonies . These laws are generally considered directory , not mandatory , and a marriage outside the statutory law-i.e. , under common or unwritten law-is by implication a legal exception , quite valid if the faith and intent behind the contract are good . Common-law marriages are recognized by the courts of most of the older States east of the Mississippi . Some of the newer States by statute expressly prohibit such unions . No nonstatutory marriage can be positively stamped as valid until its special circumstances have been reviewed by a competent court . <P> A sound common-law marriage is usually composed of : 1 ) a man and a woman both legally competent to make the contract ( age , absence of other matrimonial obligations , etc. ) ; 2 ) their actual and mutual agreement to enter the union faithfully , permanently , to the exclusion of all others ; 3 ) their cohabitation ; 4 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to seven years ) ; 5 ) their public and social conduct as man and wife . Children by such a union , the existence of a settled home , and the community 's recognition , all tend strongly to confirm the relationship as bona-fide.
