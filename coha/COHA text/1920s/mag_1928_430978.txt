W E live in what has been called , in an unpublished masterpiece , the Age of the Great Sadness . An age of transition like any other , but of change more rapid and varied than even the Renaissance knew , or the golden days of Pericles . Watts labored , and Arkwright , and Whitney , and Fulton , and Stephenson ; suddenly inventions began to breed , and life found itself caught up from a million farms and flung into a million factories ; every custom crumbled , every relation of man and man , of man and woman , of parent and child , of teacher and pupil , of master and worker , of ruler and ruled ; every faith turned into violent unbelief , or faded reticently into doubt , or remained dearer than ever to the lips because dishonored or ignored by life . How could the human mind stand the strain of so profound and complete a transformation ? Industry hurt religion because it nourished the physical sciences beyond the psychological ; because it accustomed men to think in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impersonal mechanisms rather than growing life ; because it gathered them into cities , where every faith lost edge by rubbing elbows with a hundred hostile creeds ; because it increased the prosperity of men and enabled them to enjoy the earth too well to lose themselves in hopes of heaven . Slowly Paradise ceased to allure the mind or the heart ; only cold space remained where God had held high court with saints and angels . The Universe became larger , this human planet became smaller ; the soul , left lonely by the fickle gods , knew , with a more than medieval sense , the infinite littleness of man . Then hope , cheated of heaven , came down to earth , and socialism was born . The wild rank growth of industry had brought new forms of misery to the working-man . To tend machines that raced faster and faster with every year ; to stand in the dark and filth of factories for twelve or fourteen hours a day ; or , worse , to see himself unused , while this giant slavery opened its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them leave before the sun had risen , not returning until the sun had set ; to find the old trades and skill made worthless by the iron rivals that grew up on every side about him , crushing and stifling him with their number , their weight , and their cruel speed : it was too much to bear ; one must see a way out of it , one must believe it would come to an end ; or , laughing for a final moment into the face of the meaningless tragedy , one would have to bury one 's self in the nearest stream , and seek justice or forgetfulness in death . But , even so , wealth was increasing . It made for misery only because it was gathered greedily into a few men 's hands ; let these harsh manufacturers surrender to the worker the unnecessary profit made from his toil , and wealth , like some rich manure , mere filth when huddled in one mass , would ? spread evenly over the surface of the land ? vitalize and nourish all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest , and all possible machinery were used , no man need any longer be a slave ; each would work for an hour or two , and then be as free as any child . Or let the state , in its new omnipotence , become the great father and employer of all men , uniting industry , destroying waste , and turning every profit back to the common man . Perhaps the workers themselves would build great industries , and make a cooperative commonwealth in which no hand would be soiled with gain , and all work would be glorified with brotherhood . In some way a better world would be born . In that Utopia the poor man would come into his own like Lazarus in heaven ; there would be no wolves at the door in that fair country ; and men would never suffer want again . Every child would be healthy and every mother blessed ; schools would be everywhere , and a thousand colleges would open their doors to all who should thirst for knowledge . Great athletic grounds and bright fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a house , with green grass round about it , and no barriers to the sun ; vast giants of iron and steel , moved with a magic touch of electric power , would do the menial work of the world . In that day would come at last the reward and consolation for years of sorrow and toil ; in that day all the injustice of this evil time would be redressed ; and even the course of true love would run smooth . Perhaps these first seers of the dream would never enter the promised land : but they had glimpsed its golden portals , and their children 's children would possess the Kingdom . So the new religion grew , and had its Bible , its prophets , its martyrs and its saints . " Das Kapital " emerged , and stunted the adolescent faith with a virulent orthodoxy . Jeremiads and controversies filled the air ; sects multiplied into a jungle of murderously jealous creeds . Chartism made its heroic effort , and fell beneath the weight of its vast petitions ; the wave of rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overalls sat with swallowtails in the government of France . Lassalle , the most lovable of leaders , because led even to death by love , seemed to make socialism inevitable by the per- suasion of his presence and his speech ; in his country a vast organization rose which all the world thought socialist . When Lassalle was gone , and Bismarck was ready to create Germany at Versailles , the wave of revolution rose again ; and when it receded it left ten thousand Communards slain in the streets of Paris ? city of joy and despair , where to this day , in the chaos of its corruption and its beauty , one sees those specters lying at the tourist 's feet . What a battle it was , that nineteenth century ? the cleavage between owner and toiler growing always deeper , the workers multiplying and suffering , thinking and organizing , fighting and losing , fighting from 1789 , through 1848 , and 1871 , and 1905 , until in 1917 their long-awaited hour came . When Lenin sat in the palace of the Czars the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumphant close . At last , at last after so many trials and so many defeats , socialism had come ! Here was the modern state , powerful with great armies and meteoric geniuses ; it need only put out its hand , resolute with the strength and faith of the Slav , and force the chaos of capitalism into the order of a fraternal commonwealth . It would take over railroads , and mills , and ships , and factories , and trade ; it would draw those thousand conflicting threads together into one advancing purpose , like great Gulliver harnessing the Lilliputian fleet . It would put an end to the exploitation of man by man , of woman by man , of children by man or woman ; it would give to each worker an equal share , or at the very least an equitable share , of the goods in this new and better world ; it would be a just and loving father , in whose family there could never be poverty any more . Strangers meeting in the streets of St. Petersburg embraced one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother wept because her child had died , a youth reproached her : " Mother , why do you cry ? Do you not know that socialism has come , and that we shall all be happy now ? " II From that peak of passion and belief how have the mighty fallen ! Those who hoped most are bitterest in their disappointment and most dramatic in their despair ; those who were most certain then are those who now doubt every ideal and every good . A cynic is a romantic who is dead . In Russia the leaders who made the Revolution are replaced by " practical men " who feel themselves compelled to abandon the dreams of communism one by one and to yield year by year to those human instincts which make the conservative peasantry in the fields , and the conservative bourgeoisie in the cities . It is the fate of revolutions to create , by radical legislation , a new conservative class ; by distributing the land of a few feudal lords among a million families it widens the hold of greed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the life of the nation for centuries to come . So it was after 1789 ; so it must be after 1917 . The proletarian revolution will have as its sole result ( though a basic and far-reaching result , and a  | vast step onward ) the transforma tion of twentieth-century Russia into a gigantic nineteenth-century France ; the mujiks will force an individualistic economy upon a so cialistic government . By 1930 the peasant demand for the divine right to sell not to the state but to the highest bidder , and to buy not from the state but from the lowest bidder will have broken down all resistance before it . Soon thereafter this policy of barter will have developed a new middle class , skilled in the arts o exchange , and clever enough , as in prosperous America , to squeeze into their treasuries the flow of goods from producer to consumer , from proletaire to peasant and from peasant to proletaire . Vatura non faci saltum ; the individualistic disease must run its course and develop its own cures . Only a wise man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly , the socialists made the revolution , and the bourgeoisie inherits it . In France the cautious peasant , preserved in power by birth-control and the undivided transmission of his land , offers to the middle classes the support which enables them to master the impotent wage-earners of the towns . In Italy the workers played at revolution for a time , and found that something more than mere possession was needed to run industry ; chastened with a humiliating disillusionment they have surrendered so completely that a bold dictatorship can build upon them a manufacturers ' paradise . In England the workers were so well-organized , so guarded from " blacklegs " at home and innocent labor imported from abroad , that for a moment they thought of seizing power ; then the terrible responsibility of taking the intricate processes of industry from the hands of economic law , and replacing supplyand demand with national foresight and control , daunted the statisticians of the proletariat , and led to an abdication which has left the British employer more powerful than at any time since the coming of the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonted thing for generations , the socialist sun , which rose there so hopefully , seems to have passed its meridian , and begins to sink ingloriously . What shall we say of America ? Recall the days when our two-byfour statesmen saw a communist revolution in every speech , planted agents provocateurs to produce some semblance of their prophecies , and destroyed that traditional freedom to entertain wrong ideas which is the indispensable condition of coming occasionally upon new truth . Only the communists agreed with the government , strangely ; they too considered revolution imminent because they had told Moscow so , and it is comforting to believe our own lies . A handful of street-corner diplomats and tea-room philosophers had consented to undertake the salvation of America . The first item on their program , they announced , was to hang the editor of the New York " Call , " because he was only a socialist . In this persuasive way they would inaugurate the brotherhood of man . And now where are the radicals of yesteryear ? Where have they gone to , those picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some of them have abandoned their hopes because the modest sueBess of the Russian Revolution seems to their unhistoric eyes a profound and catastrophic failure ; in this way , and by dividing radicals bitterly everywhere , the great communistic experiment has almost put an end to socialism for at least a generation . Some socialists , some communists , even some liberals , have grown rich ; and the apathy of the age does not , as in the past , replace them with pious recruits . It is difficult to remain radical when one becomes a partner in the firm , or builds a sweat-shop of his own , or finds royalties raining down upon him out of the unsuspected skies . It is difficult in general for a country to be radical when every class in it is prosperous ( except the farmers , who are conservative because they fear that radicalism will take from them the land which they think they own ) ; when almost every family is rich enough to afford the nuisance of owning a home ; and when automobiles are so common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of distinctive snobbery . It is , above all , this shameless and unparalleled prosperity that has killed or wounded the cock-robin that used to chant the songs of revolution . There are some other radicals who have arrived at disillusionment not through wealth but through a decreasing certainty in their knowledge . They have come ( as the wage-workers long since came ) to doubt the adequacy of the proletariat to cope with the complexities and inter-relations of industry . They have come to fear the precariousness , and to question the ultimate value , of violent social change ; they have realized the almost ineradicable rootage of the acquisitive impulse in mankind . These men , like Fra Giovanni in Anatole France 's tale , have been enlightened less by the coming of sudden wealth than by the unveiling of the much-sought and disappointing lady known as Truth . It is they who have felt that double bereavement ? first of theological and then of social and political ideals ? which leaves this generation becalmed in the midst of its speed , and troubled amidst its bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-socialists who surround us , for they are more conscious than the others of the causes of their change . If we can analyze the transformation which has come upon their ideas we may find them of some help in our efforts to understand the meaning and possibilities of human life . Let us walk with them awhile , and let them speak . III " At the bottom of our disillusionment , " says such a reformed reformer , " is the discovery of the natural inequality of mankind . Even the origin of the idea of equality is bound up with the inevitable stratification of men in a developing society . It appears among the pupils of Socrates , in Diogenes and Antisthenes , as a reaction to the growth of wealth and power in the commercial class at Athens ; it rises again among the early Christians , as a foil to the imperial aristocracy of Rome ; and it finds its modern formulation in the eighteenth cen- tury as a covert appeal for the political equalization not of the people but of the powerful bourgeoisie with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has put an end to this nonsense . It is bitterly clear that all individuals , races , and species are by nature unequal , through different fortune in heredity and environment ; and that these inequalities , as the material worked upon by natural selection , are an indispensable source of evolution . If organisms were equal there could be no selection , no emulation and no development . " Further , the very character of the struggle for existence is such that evolution strengthens just those acquisitive , competitive and pugnacious impulses which make man so incorrigible an individualistic , so unhappy and unmanageable in the harness of socialism . Nietzsche thought every organism was moved above all by a will to power ; and though he underestimated the highly developed instinct to sit down , there was some truth in his analysis , as any one knows who has been intimate with radical parties . Watch their quarrels , their strife for office , their endless divisions ; the only reason for having so many factions is that there may be more offices to go around . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Watch the jurisdictional disputes of tradeunions , those organizations upon which we used to build our syndicalist Utopias ; are these disputes settled by right or by might ? Every one is just , until he is strong . All this may be changed , but it will take a few years ; you can not abolish the survival of the cleverest by law . " Only the man who is consciously below the average in power desires equality ; the others prefer freedom . Even the man below the average may wish the individualistic game to go on ; he is a gambler , and likes the lottery of modern life ; you can never convince him that the books ' are fixed against him , and that he has only one chance in a hundred of winning a place . Range all the persons in a society in the order of their economic ability ; those below the mean may support the movement for equality ; those above it will oppose it . Since by hypothesis those above the mean are the more capable in the practical concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialism will never come within the scope of reality until it accepts inequality as fated , and soothes the capable with the promise of superior rewards . " Acquisition may not be the most profound or intense of the instincts , but it is the most perennial . We tire of eating , or of playing , or of fighting , or even of loving ; but we seem never to tire of acquisition . Only the richest and the poorest are relatively free from it ; between these extremes , all along the social line , the fever rages . Those who suffer most are the ones who can remember the days when they were poor ; avarice , ' said Balzac , begins where poverty ends . ' No wonder this impulse is persistent ; it has its origin in the search for food , and thence spreads to include all useful , and many useless , things ; in every generation it was necessary to survival , and those who had it most were surest to be selected and to propagate their like . Its source is insecurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog is greedy because he bas no confidence in the future , and lkas many bitter memories of the past . Perhaps when social order is thoroughly secure , and economic provision makes famine rare , men will be less eager to accumulate , and more willing to give and to share . But now ( and it will be so for generations to come ) the impulse of acquisition , with the impulse of mating , forms the inescapable basis of our lives . " It is this disease of acquisition , " continues the reformed reformer , " that destroys equality as civilization grows . Equality is like equilibrium ; the slightest touch of difference brings it to an end . In primitive life , where land was plentiful and tools simple , and the family encouraged mutual aid , equality flourished by comparison with to-day ; but when inventions came , and created the division of labor and the specialization of function , men became unequally valuable to society , according to the importance of the varied functions which they performed ; and from that moment stratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century we have passed from an almost ideal equality to an unprecedented variety and inequality of classes , by the multiplication of inventions and the natural diversity and acquisitiveness of man . The same process of differentiation is destroying socialism in Australia . The same process will destroy it in Russia too , though the state and the army stand ready to defend and preserve it against the greed of man . Nature will out . " As economic inequality increases , the aspiration to equality develops as a compensatory ideal ' ; and socialism appears . It tends to take a political form ; for the rise of the bourgeoisie has meanwhile created democracy ; and the delusion naturally grows that the poor , being more numerous than the rich , can by voting seize the reins of government and legislate themselves into prosperity and happiness . It is astounding that the disciples of Marx , who insisted that political power must follow and obey economic power , could deceive themselves so long with this reliance upon the vote . Not to speak of the actual numerical majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would have wrecked it had it come to political supremacy . The upper classes - the financiers and investors , the directors of great corporations ? were not enamoured of it ; the middle classes ? the merchants , the manufacturers , the promoters , the managers , the technicians , the professions , the tradesmen ? were hostile to it ; the lower classes ? the farmers , the workers organized in the American Federation of Labor , and the vast unorganized proletariat ? were bitterly opposed to it . The farmer feared the nationalization of his land ; the skilled worker feared the leveling of the egalitarian scheme ; and the unskilled worker resented the socialist attack upon the religions which brightened his dark world with the rays of heaven . The most antisocialist group in America was composed of precisely those manual workers whose good it wished to promote ; and the men and women who most effectively labored for it were the intellectuals who would have lost and suffered most in a revolu- tion . Perhaps the proletariat was wiser , and knew that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement was continuously bled of its finest men by the fluidity of classes in America , by the leakage of ability from the ranks of the radicals to the classes of the economically established and politically content . Successful men are not revolutionists ; and married men are not radicals . Some world-reformers married and forgot the universe in their families ; having accumulated a thousand dollars they trembled at the thought that some overturn in Washington might ruin the value of what they had saved , and prevent them from losing it to some real estate poet . Other radical leaders went into business , and succeeded ; they discovered the virtues of capitalism ? the stimulus to enterprise and initiative , the natural adjustment of reward to risk and energy ; and they found it inconvenient to retain their youthful creed . For awhile they continued to call themselves socialists , in loyalty to the traditions of their impecunious days . " Those who were left in the movement ? excepting a few saints and such as could console themselves with the honors and emoluments of office ? were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , they took to writing articles and making speeches ; and they atoned for the evaporation of their following by t ' -e violence of their speech and the imperiousness of their demands . ' Unable to fight the common enemy , they fought among themselves ; the same rebelliousness that had made them resent this capitalistic world made them object to discipline within their own ranks . The individualism of socialism ruined it . " Perhaps it will always be so . Perhaps socialism has always been and will always be a voice in the wilderness , the voice of weakness confronted with strength , of unestablished youth in the face of a world whose doors do not open but must be broken through . It was the voice of Amos standing in the gate , and calling for righteousness ; but Amos is gone , and the bankers remain . It was the voice of Diogenes in his tub , and Antisthenes in his rage ; but even as they spoke Alexander was preparing to conquer the world . It was the voice of Christ , heard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth grew rich , and who dares be a Christian now ? It was the voice of St. Francis , calling to us to live like the swallows of the air and the lilies of the field ; it is still the voice of holy monks , living in simplicity and without greed ; but the world forgets them , and hurries by in its eternal quest for gold . The race has always had its Tolstoys , its Ruskins , its Hugos and its Whitmans ; literature is a compensatory foil to the brutalities of life ; and socialism , like Christianity , is the ideal which soothes our consciences as we struggle for place and power . If one refuses to participate in the race , life crushes him under the runners ' feet ; his cry of despair is heard for a moment , but the race goes wildly on , and its rewards are to the swift and the strong . What is has always been , and will always be ; the poor we shall always have with us , for they are the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be merry , and forget that we ever dreamed . "  | IV So far Sir Oracle Cynical , Mr. Worldly Wiseman , who knows that there is nothing new under the sun , and that all is a chasing after the grind . And yet why should we be so sad in our merriment , and so desolate in our drinking ? If socialism aimed at bettering the lot of the workers , it has been displaced only by the fulfilment of its aim . At this moment , through the same window which opens to the first messages of spring , comes the sound of a great machine ; a giant mechanism digging steadily , resolutely , a trench along the street . Deep into the earth sink the iron teeth ; a great shovel captures the loosened rock and soil and lifts them into a massive truck ; in a trice the truck is filled , and by some magic power the heavy load is drawn away . Here is menial work , but no manual toil , and no slavery ; only a proud mechanic guiding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth with a touch of his foot and the turn of a wheel . There , but for time and genius , go a hundred slaves ; one sees them plainly by piercing the present into the past : poor skill-less men , digging wearily , with tools a thousand years old , in ways a thousand years old , with patience a thousand years old , never dreaming that their slavery will end . There will always be slaves , said Aristotle , twenty-four hundred years ago , " until looms weave of their own accord , and machines do without question the bidding of men . " Is that vision coming true ? On the wires birds sing ; suddenly the ungainly poles that serve the telegraph and the telephone take on the form and music of poetry . In the wires that strange thing rides which Franklin found in the clouds and which we shall snatch from all rushing streams , harnessing it to the engines that shall do the work of a continent . Far to the north , where our eyes can not reach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power-station taps the energies of a colossal cataract , pouring forth energy , as by the miracle of some abounding god , into a thousand factories and a hundred thousand homes ; looms weave of their own accord , vast weights are moved , books are printed and bound , and light floods life as if creation had just begun . Everywhere the fluent wonder-worker goes , striking the shackles from a hundred men at each step , making mechanical power cheaper than the humblest brawn , compelling men to be only the intellectual factor , no longer needing brute muscle , in the work of life . It is a strange denouement to the drama of a century , to that great play which began with the wrecking of the machines in Lancashire , and rose to the climax of a Labor Government in England and a triumphant Soviet . But here is no dictatorship of the proletariat ; here on the contrary is its disappearance . Slavery comes to an end not because it is unjust , but because it is too wasteful a way of producing the goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come , not through justice but through the growing dissatisfaction of technical and executive minds with the wastefulness and chaos of individualist industry ? It would be a pleasant turn of affairs ( would it not ? ) if socialism ? the replacement of com- petition by cooperation in our economic life ? were to come not from below but from above , not from the weak but from the strong , not from men suffering with poverty , but from men empowered by wealth and enlightened by education . It is not the brave rebel in the ranks who will bring a better order to mankind ; it is the wiser leaders of great industry , and the quietly competent inventors , technicians and engineers , who will declare war against waste , duplication , disorder , mediocrity and dishonesty in the factories and markets and offices of the world . Let us dream . We began with dreams , we end with dreams ; and when dreams are no more we shall be animals again . It is a gathering of the great executives of America , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to any but themselves . The heads of the major banking firms are there , representing investments so great that the mind halts figuring them . The heads of the larger industries are there ? leaders of corporations which have passed from the stage of ruthless exploitation and public disrepute to a humaner regime in which brutality and waste and incompetence lessen with every year . The heads of the transportation systems are there , flushed with their revived prosperity . The great inventors are there , and the men who have set all the world moving upon rubber wheels . The advertisers are not there , nor the salesmen , nor the philosophers . And the man who has called them together speaks . " Gentlemen , " he says , " we are so rich that mere wealth can not satisfy us any more .
