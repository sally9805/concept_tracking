txt Colonel SMITH of Illinois evidently has n't a heart that beats warmly for this festive season . He announces that he Is going to accept appointment to the Senate , but that he will not pre , : ent his credentials until after the holidayrecess . This makes it certain that at least all of the Republican Senators will have a wretched Christmas . Outside their windows hey will see Colonel Smrrst as an unhappy " wait " singing his doleful ditty . When " Boxing Day " comes he will be there still asking them what they are going to do with him . All this is very hard , particularly on the " good boys " of the Sente , they thought that they had ever ) thing arranged , and that Colonel SMITH would not present himself at this session of Congress at all . But he and Governor SMALL of Illinois are plainly in an ugly mood and ready to kick over every arrangement that the Senators at Washington have proposed in order to avoid trouble . One hardly sees why the grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem so inconsolatile . What they foresee is a long and turbulent debate on the admission of Colonel SMITH , with a probable blockade of the public business resulting in the necessity of an extra session at the i:ext Congress . But if the orators could e got to restrain themselves within human limits , a decision in the Smith ease might be reached at an early date . indeed , it is said already to have been reached . Enough Senators to exclude colonel SMITH are said to be pledged o vote against his ' wing admitted even temporarily . if it is all settled , why talk about it indefinitely ? That question would be pertinent to almost any Assembly except the Senate of the rnited States , which must speak or even on a foregone issue . The serious part of the business. - erious , that is. for the Republican Party ? is that the early coming of Colonel SMITH to the door of the Sen : te will force a decision affecting not merely his appointment for the unexpired term of Senator MCKINLEY. but his election for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers had earnestly sought to stave off . They had thought something might happen before the Seventieth Congress to avert the trouble which they fear , but now here it is cruelly thrust upon them right at the beginning of Christmas joys . They will not be able to escape it throughout their holiday vacation , and there will be no way when they go back to Washington of dodging the questions involved in the defiant attitude of ' Colonel SMITH . ' le declares that he wishes to be admitted to the Senate , if only for the time being , in order to state his side of the case as it should be stated . It is understood that he wants to draw a comparison between the campaign fund of which he enjoyed ? the benefit and the money contributed to the election of a Republican Pres ' . dent by sources which , be will claim , are just as suspicious . This kind of blurting out the facts by a reckless man is the last thing the Republican managers want . Even now they are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fell purpose . Apparently it will be a hot Competition between them and him to see which can make the Christmastide more unhappy for the other .
