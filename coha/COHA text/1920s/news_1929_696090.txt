Public Chary Were it not for the fact that the public is extremely chary at the moment , it is probable that the market could have recorded some attractive advances during the past week . Some of the popular leaders showed ability to move ahead , but this did not bring an outside following into the market , due to the unwillingness of the public to be attracted to the long side . The issues which moved ahead are credited with having strong sponsorship , and their upturns brought some buying from the floor traders and professionals who - watch for what they consider favorable opportunities . Erie Some of the large commission houses continue to recommend Erie as a purchase to their customers . They are optimistic on this issue because of the excellent showing of earnings . They point out that net last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hrst two months of this year the gain amounted to 126% over the same period last year .

They also point to the export trend of cars as encouraging for motor shareholders . and believe a resumption of the advance in the stock market later on will result in larger sales through dealers . Wright Weakness in Wright Aeronautical at times recently was due to selling in anticipation of a poor report for the first quarter .

Public Utilities Public utility shares have been more or less neglected in recent weeks , with the result that there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long position when this group was in the front ranks of the strong stocks .
