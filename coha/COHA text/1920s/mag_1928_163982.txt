The one &; only U. S. Navy flier to qualify officially as an " ace " in the War was David Sinton Ingalls , a quizzical , shock-headed grandnephew of William Howard Taft . He left his class at Yale to fly and was 18 years old when the Armistice was signed . Ace Ingalls went back to college with his decorations in his pocket and applied himself to the harder heroics of graduating and getting a law degree . Then he married , was twice a father , practiced law quietly in his native Cleveland , entered the Ohio legislature . Rich , he never returned to France ; but proceeded , by interesting himself in all manner of local business and civic enterprises , to make Cleveland his world . Like many another War flier , he flew no more , though instinct obliged him to drive his automobile at unearthly speeds . <P> Then , as with many another War flier , " air fever " once more laid hold of Ace Ingalls . Last week , news leaked out that he and Heraclio Alfaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin aircraft company in Cleveland , were building a plane of secret design , trying to win the Guggenheim Foundation 's $100,000 prize for aeronautical progress . At the same time , people learned that Ace Ingalls was on his hometown Chamber of Commerce 's aviation committee , helping to make Cleveland a bigger &; better airport . Other retired fliers knew how Ace Ingalls felt when , quizzed by importunate newsgatherers about his new plane , he squinted , smiled and said : <P> " Well , do n't say too much about that , for everybody in Cleveland will be kidding me about it . But I am awfully anxious to get back to flying again . It 's much safer than driving an automobile , at least for me . I 'd feel safer flying a ship to Columbus* than driving a car . But you know how wives are- " <P> <P> * Capital of Ohio , where the Legislature meets .
