Provisions of Long-Awaited Bill . copyright . 1925. by Too Nor York Timer Company . Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES . PARIS , Saturday , June 27 . ? Finance Minister Callaux introduced in the Chamber yesterday ( Friday ) afternoon the long-awaited bill for relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beginning of the consolidation of the floating debt . In brief hb proposals are as outlined yesterday : A limited increase in circulation by 6,000,000.000 francs wherewith to meet immediate calls on the Treasury due to maturity of defense and Treasury bonds during the next six months and for consolidation of the remaining bonds into a new issue to which bondholders only will be allowed to subscribe , the interest rate to be lower than the existing rates but with the inducement that the bonds will be paid at the gold rate . During the discussion of the project in an all-night session of the Chamber it was evident the Opposition had , no intention to launch a heavy attack against the measure . Such criticism as developed was purely perfunctory and not calculated to block adoption . M. Caillaux himself , confident of victory , defended the project in a brief , decisive speech which won him an ovation from the Centre and Cartel groups . " This is no time for sensational measures , " said M. Caillaux . " We 're resting within the , limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclude audacity . But audacity requires confidence . and I am fully confident the country . eager to recuperate and extricate itself from the morass and reestablish itself , will respond to the appeal made to it by the Government. - Folowing M. Caillaux 's defense of the project the Socialists forced upon the Chamber a discussion of its counter projects , particularly the capital levy . At 4 o'clock this morning after a telling speech by Leon Blum , the Socialist leader , the counter project for a capital levy was voted on and defeated , 210 votes being cast in favor and 340 against . Passage by Chamber Seems Asured . With defeat of the capital levy , passage of the Caillaux bill seemed assured of adoption tw a substantial majority . The bill consists of only four articles . ' I r , the first the Finance Minister allocates to hie , office the power to control expenditure which formerly has been invested in two organizations appointed by Parliament . lie will be enabled to make use of these organizations and proceed with their recommendations by decree if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of needing the sanction of the whole Cabinet , Article II sanctions the Bank of France advances to the State authorized I last April until July 14 and authorizes a further advance of 6,000,000.000 . Article III empowers emission of the conoolida tion loan and Article IV fixes the floating debt of the Treasury at the sum reached on closing the subscription to this loan . Immediately after M. Caillaux had presented the pill the Chamber adjourned to permit the Finance Commis- , Sion to bring in a report . It was hoped this report would be ready by 6 o'clock and a special session of the Senate was called for 9:30 to receive the bill from the Chamber so as to enable it to be passed through both houses this evening . At 6 o'clock the Finance Commission , however , reported it needed more time and the Chamber again adjourned until 10:30 . Capital Levy Rejected . Caillaux 's first victory came almost Immediately in the Finance Commission . The Socialists , anxious to obtain a record of their wishes , introduced a counterproject to that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This proposal was rejected by the commission by 21 votes against 16. and consideration of Caillaux 's project was voted , 20 to 10 . While the commission was sitting various Parliamentary parties held meetings to consider the attitude they would adopt . Among the Nationalists there was a threat at first of sonic opposition , but the great majority . declaring they had no other interest than the national interest , rallied to the motion of Deputy Franeols de Wendel. member of the great Lorraine iron firm , that the bill be adopted . Among the Left groups discussion was very animated . Lean Blum announced that , conformably with the Socialist will I expressed in the recent referendum , his party would in future maintain objective reserve on all questions , but while maintaining liberty toward the present Government . would seek to remain faithful to the union . This statement must be interpreted as an open manoeuvre by the Socialists to keep control of the Cartel and in the name Left unity induce the radicals also to maintain a reserved attitude toward the Government . It had Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the request that a delay of at least a few hours be granted before the project was submitted to a vote . A Cartel meeting decided to ask the Government to insert In the bill a promise to present within the shortest possible time a complementary bill for improvement of the financial position by amortization of the public debt through allocation of certain resources , which would be some sort of a counterpart to the 0.000,000,000 francs increase in circulation . This motion was backed by Loucher , Dumesnil and several other influential members of the Left and Centre . The Finance Commission accepted the suggestion and added to the project an article providing for presentation of a complementary bill , such as suggested by the Cartel , before the end of the present session . It was with this amendment that the Caillaux bill was finally submitted to the Chamber for adoption late last night . Text of Preamble and BM . The following is the complete text of the preamble and clauses of Caillaux 's bill " for relief of the difficulties of the treasury and lightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the financial situation of France and how grave it might become if decisive remedies were not applied . During these last months difficulties of the Treasury have increased through the retirement of national defense bonds . On the eve of our taking direction of the Ministry of Finance a new advance of 4.000,000.000 francs had been made by the Bank of France to the Treasury . Of that amount 2,300,000,000 was needed to liquidate the existing situation . Only 1,700,000.000 remained at the disposal pf the Treasury , but In spite of notable surpluses from taxation , due to ? the needs of the budget and those of the Treasury which accrued through the deficit and the national defense bonds , this amount now has been almost totally absorbed . You know , moreover , that during coming weeks heavy maturities must be met ? 1.500,0110,000 francs during July and 3.500.000.000 during September  --  must be repaid to bearers of national credit and Treasury bonds . The situation in which we find ourselves is , therefore , that we must assure payment of these sums and avoid that the nonrenewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order to meet the ' situation and at the same time relieve the State of the floating debt of which the mass might at any moment become perilous. we have wished to employ only normal methods . Convinced that this country which has accomplished so much in the past is unwilling to give up the struggle and havingmoreover many evidences of the admirable vitality of France . we desire to avoid every system of constraint , we make an urgent last appeal to the nation 's wish to live and demand that it help us by voluntary efforts to free the Treasury from pressing difficulties and dissipate disquiet for the future . The loan to which with this aim we invite our fellow citizens to subscribe should give them confidence at the same time in the efficacy of the aid which they are bringing to us and in the security of the use they are making of their money . By placing them out of danger of the variations of exchange and by assuring them the advantage which the full success of this loan will bring in renewing confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double assurance they are helping the country and acting in their own best interest . We can not believe this pressing appeal in the name of the Republic and in the name of France by the Government and Parliament to the whole nation will not be heard . The loan which we propose is destined only for consolidation of the floating debt : moreover , subscription will be open only to bearers of defense bonds . But with whatever haste this measure might be realized it can not be prompt enough to avoid our asking you for other measures destined to assure the life of the State in days to come . During the month of July budgetary charges will be particularly heavy . The amount of Treasury bonds deposed for reimbursement constitutes a second burden on the Treasury . If a new advance of 6,000,000,000 francs is not obtained from the Bank of France the Treasury will not be able to assure meeting obligations during the coming months . We firmly hope that with the aid of the Bank of France , once the larger portion of national defense bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suffice to meet all expenditure of the 1925 budget which is uncovered by income and for all needs of the Treasury until the end of the year . %e shall then have succeeded in surmounting present difficulties . The complete balancing , of the 1926 budget which we will ask you to assure by voting the necessary taxes will definitely guarantee us against return of such a situation . The era of loans will be thus closed . Article IV of the bill we are submitting marks the Government 's formal decision in this matter . Its adoption by Parliament will impose that decision by law on all succeeding Governments . This is only the first step on the road to the consolidation of our finances . The second and perhaps more . essential step will be obtained the day when all public expenditure , which Article I of this bill will provide means of reducing , will be covered by taxation alone . Further steps certainly will have to be taken and we will shortly invite you to consider them . Thus all ideas and suggestions which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time as the proposals formulated by the Government . For the present it is , however . essential to restrict our efforts . We are asking you today to Provide us with the means of solving the first and most urgent problems with which we are faced . We have the firm hope that if the representatives of the country follow us in a wise and energetic policy which appears to us indispensable , if the country itself helps us by confident collaboration , we will soon be able to get rid of the burden of the past and be able to look into the future . Article I. The Minister of Finance 10 authorized to make use of the powers invested by decrees of March 14 , 1920 , in the Higher Committee of Inquiry , and by decree of Aug. 1 , 1922 , in the Extra Parliamentary Commission on Economies . For this purpose the different control organizations will be put at his disposal . Decrees of presentation of parliamentary bills and of administrative . regulation which may result from the conclusion of this inquiry will bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ministers and the Minister of Finance . Article II . The convention of April 7 , 1925 , between the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of France , is definitely approved . The Minister of Finance is authorized to make with the Governor of the Bank of France a convention by which that establishment will consent to the further advance of 6,000,000,000 francs to the State . This convention will be free of stamp registration duties . The maximum total issue of bank notes by the Bank of France and branches , which is fixed by the law of April 15 , 1933 , at 45,000,000,000 francs , is thus increased to 51.000,000,000 . Article III . The Minister of Finance is authorized to issue a loan strictly reserved to bearers of National Defense bonds . The interest and conditions of this loan , to which will be accorded a guarantee of . exchange and to which may be ginen privileges conceded to National Defense bonds by the law of March 13 , 1924 , will be fixed by decree . Article IV . The maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of France determined by Article II , will be fixed at the sum which is reached on the date of closure of subscription to the loan described in Article HI . This total ' can not be later increased except by sums necessary for reimbursement of the short-term debt falling due . BILL CAUSES BREAK IN FRANC . Italian Exchange Also Falls Under Heavy Selling From Abroad . Under pressure caused chiefly by announcement of ' a proposed increase of 6,000,000,000 francs In French note circulation , francs broke 0% points in the New York foreign exchange market yesterday and closed at 4.49% the lowest point reached since early in March , 1924 , when the franc sold ? A the lowest point in history . The break In francs carried Italian lire down 11 points , to a new low record at 3:5914 . Scandinavian exchanges continued their advances , new high rec. , ords for several years being established ' in both Danish and Norwegian krone . There was heavy selling of francs all day , most of it apparently coming from French sources and reflecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial policies . The flight of capital from France , which has been intermittent for some time , was renewed in heavy volume as a result of the announcement of Finance Minister Calllaus. ' s plan , which calls for the creation of 0,000,000,000 francs in new bank notes . and an offer of a loan with an ex .. change guarantee to holders of defense bonds . It is expected in Wall Street that later in the year a large loan to France will be arranged in New York any ) that exchange then will be stabilized on a gold basis , but the French exchange market at present is almost entirely without support . The visit to France of Dwight W. Morrow and Russell O Leffingwell , partners in J. P. Morgan &; Co .. who are sailing today , is causing comment in Wall Street on the possinility , of new French financing , although I'dorrew and Mr. Leffingwell both emphasized that they were going abroad only for a vacation . France now has a 51,00,000,000 credit with J. P. Morgan &; Co. for the support of exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having , been used . and Finance Minister Caillaux has announced that the credit would be held in reserve to combat speculative attacks on the franc . Italian exchange moved down irk sympathy with the franc and also on heavy Italian selling , part of which was described as commercial and part of which represented transfers of Italian funds . apparently due to uneasiness over the financial situation . In the case of Danish exchange there was a renewal of the heavy buying that has prevailed for more than a week . The demand was declared to be due to . strikingly favorable Danish trade figures , and also to intimations that the Danish Government intends to place its finances en a much stronger position . The plans are understoted  --  to include refunding the internal debt and reducing the interest rate from 6 to 4 per vent . it is also heard that a large internal loan will be floated shortly . Danish krone reached a new high record at 19.74 and Norwegian krone also ee.ablished a. , upw high , at 17.48        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
