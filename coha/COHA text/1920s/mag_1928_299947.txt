Out , in a guarded way , came Oswald Garrison Villard and the embattled Nation ( liberal weekly ) for Nominee Smith . Let the latter continue his " frank clarity of utterance , " said Editor Villard , and " he will win the support of most of the 5,000,000 voters who supported La Follette in 1924 . " <P> In 1924 , La Follette carried only Wisconsin , with 15 electoral votes . But , had the La Follette and Davis votes been pooled , President Coolidge would have lost 13 of the States which he won and 86 of his electoral votes . He would still have been President Coolidge , 296 electoral votes to 235 . But the thought is not without interest this year , with Nominee Smith combining many of the qualities and appeals of both Davis and La Follette . <P> The 13 States were the following : <P> Electoral Votes <P> Arizona 3 <P> Idaho 4 <P> Kentucky 13 <P> Maryland 8 <P> Missouri 18 <P> Montana 4 <P> Nebraska 8 <P> Nevada 3 <P> New Mexico 3 <P> North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Virginia 8 <P> 86 <P> In four other States the Coolidge majority was slender . In Minnesota , where some 815,000 votes were cast , Coolidge led the Davis-La Follette total by only 26,000 . In Oregon , with some 278,000 votes cast , the Coolidge majority was 6,000 . In Washington it was 27,000 , with about 413,000 votes cast ; in Wyoming it was 3,800 with 79,800 voting . These four States contain 27 electoral votes . President Coolidge could have lost them all and still won . <P> Disregarding the fact that four-year-old figures , issues , situations are next to useless in making political forecasts , a neat academic proposition for domestic debate might be : Resolved , That Hoover , another Coolidge , can ( or can not ) get more electoral votes than Smith , another Davis-plus-La Follette.
