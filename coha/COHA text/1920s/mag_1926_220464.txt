COMMONWEALTH <P> ( British Commonwealth of Nations ) <P> The Commons- <P> Indulged in many a quiet smile as Premier Baldwin squelched several well-meaning bishops who attempted to intervene in the coal strike . ( See below . ) <P> Noted with attention a decision by the Trade Union Council to throw its support once more behind the Miners Federation . As everyone knows these potent bodies were estranged when the Council called off the " general strike " ( TIME , May 10 ) , which was originally begun to back up the coal strike . <P> Was rebuked with measured scorn and thoroughly dressed down by the Speaker , for " the gross indignity offered to Parliament and the vile discourtesy done to the House of Lords " ( TIME , July 12 ) , by Laborite M. P. 's who cat-called and booed among themselves while a message from the King was read . <P> Heard Laborite Leader Ram say Macdonald rebuke Laborite Backbencher Lawson when he attempted to heckle the Speaker . Craning his neck like an angry bull turtle , former Premier Macdonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sorry . Apologize to the Speaker . " Mr. Lawson reddened , purpled , offered the ( for him ) supreme apology of remaining silent for some hours . <P> Was the scene of an extraordinary mock session staged for the benefit of 859 U. S. college preceptors visiting London under the auspices of the Art Trust Guild of Chicago . Sir Samuel Chapman , M. P. , and Lady Astor enacted , during a recess of the House , the respective roles of a mock-Speaker and a mock-Clydside Laborite extremist . " Attaboy ! " shouted many a U. S. savant as the Right Honorable Lady refused to desist from her ex tempore harangue on War debts when called to order by " Speaker " Chapman . Eventually she subsided as her fellow M. P. 's trooped back into the House . Later the Speaker of the House testily announced that Sir Samuel had not actually committed the sacrilege of sitting in the Speaker 's Chair , but had merely stood before it . <P> Debated with exemplary decorum a Labor resolution calling for an inquiry into the propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having contracts with the Government . Laborite Arthur Henderson alleged that Minister of Health Neville Chamberlain is associated with at least two concerns having a total of 21 government contracts . Premier Baldwin championed " the principle established in 1906 of permitting Cabinet Ministers to hold honorary corporate directorships , " and the Labor motion was squelched by a government majority of 246 . Cried Laborite Henderson : " It seems that all Conservatives , like Caesar 's wife , are held by courtesy above suspicion . " <P> Were informed by Minister of Health Neville Chamberlain that one out of every seven Englishmen who reach the age of 30 ultimately dies of cancer . " But , " said Mr. Chamberlain , " a cure for cancer will come . . . . Tuberculosis , once thought incurable , is now the most curable of diseases . "
