The Marriage Whirl . Corinne Griffith has , taken so many thousands on the barb of her attraction that it is doubtless idle to intimate that this adventure is one of the worst of photoplays . It is a story of the younger generation , married and very fond of gin . Great parties in expensive country houses and great scowls on the faces of the stern fathers . Nita Naldi , slimmer these days , is very wicked . <P> Marry Me . The vogue of the light comedy is assuming permanent proportions . Florence Vidor is involved in this one which tells the tale of a rural maiden engaged to one John Smith . She writes her acceptance on an egg shell which is delivered to the wrong John Smith in a distant city . The latter is interested in matrimony but more particularly in proving , through the lady , the unconscionable period which a cold storage company had kept the egg . <P> The Woman Hater . Another one that you should arrange to miss . The great actress , toast of Paris ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry a very rich young man , she is interrupted by an elder friend of that hopeful 's distracted family . Elder friend becomes enamored for himself . <P> The Lucky Devil . In the days of Wallace Reid , they had a habit of putting him in a racing automobile whenever ideas dried up . The people went home happy . Applying this same formula to the mildly similar Richard Dix , one finds that human nature still reacts feverishly . <P> Night Life of New York . Dorothy Gish , Rod LaRocque and Ernest Torrence are no trivial trio to begin with , and their current fable gives good opportunity . It is another light comedy , the tale of a Western youth cast loose along Broadway with adequate funds . It brings in , by picture and by name , all the actual night clubs of the district , a comely telephone operator , a father who fails to impress upon his son the ultimate delights of the domestic fireside . <P> Pretty Ladies . Another bit of accuracy is here dealt round on the general subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie Cantor , Ann Pennington , Gallagher and Shean , and even Mr. Ziegfeld adequately included , is the subject . It seems that the low-comedy actress had never had a lover . It was the trap drummer that finally succumbed . They were very happy until the luxurious prima donna leered her way into their lives . Then a strange ending , so swift and so sincere as to be almost out of place .
