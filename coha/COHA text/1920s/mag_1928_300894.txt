" People are tired of hearing of these oil leases . " - Dr . Hubert Work , onetime ( 1923-28 ) Secretary of the Interior , now Chairman of the Republican National Committee . <P> The Oil Scandals , as everyone knows , began in the administration of President Harding . It looked last week as though the oldtime sins of commission had been followed , in the Coolidge era , by sins of omission . <P> Lease . Besides the Teapot Dome oil reserve in Wyoming , whilom Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall leased to Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair a tract adjacent to Teapot Dome on the north , in the field known as Salt Creek . Some 42 miles north of Casper , Wyo. , the Salt Creek field is bigger than Teapot Dome . Its 2,000 wells produce some 38,000 bbls. per day , about 19 times the output of the 63 wells in Teapot Dome . <P> As in the case of the Teapot Dome lease , there were irregularities in this Fall-Sinclair transaction . <P> Investigation . Last January , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that just before and just after Dec. 20 , 1922 , the date of the Salt Creek lease , Oilman Sinclair gave or loaned Secretary Fall $35,000 . The day the bids for the Salt Creek contract were supposed to close , Oilman Sinclair was on a train returning from a visit to the Fall ranch in New Mexico . It was nine hours after the legal time was up when Oilman Sinclair sent in his bid , by telegram from Pratt , Kan . Simultaneously , Fall wired Assistant Secretary of the Interior Edward Clingan Finney not to be too formal about the bids . The belated Sinclair bid was accordingly admitted . When Fall returned to Washington he threw out twelve other bids and awarded the contract to Sinclair . It was a contract to extract oil from U. S. property on a royalty basis . In Fall 's advertisement for bids nothing had been said about including in the lease an option to renew if the successful bidder found his bargain profitable . Yet into Sinclair 's five-year contract was inserted such an option , to renew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all these facts was in progress last winter just before and at the moment that Secretary Work had to decide about letting Sinclair exercise his Salt Creek option . Besides the Senate 's investigation , the trial of Sinclair for criminal conspiracy was then fresh in Washington 's mind . Sinclair 's was an extraordinary name indeed , but Dr. Work took no extraordinary precautions . He simply asked the Solicitor of the Interior Department if he thought Sinclair 's option was valid . Solicitor Ernest Odell Patterson said he thought it was .
