A bread &; butter note was penned , last week , by the slightly rheumatic hand of His Majesty George V , King-Emperor , Defender of the Faith . <P> The note began " My dear Portland " and ended : <P> " Believe me , very sincerely yours , <P> " George R. I. " <P> The note was dutifully due because Their Majesties had just been the house guests , at historic Welbeck Abbey , of William John Arthur Charles James Cavendish-Bentinck , 6th Duke of Portland , Earl of Portland , and onetime Master of the Horse to His Majesty . <P> A very old and broken-down horse attracted the attention of Winifred , Duchess of Portland , in London some months ago . Touched by the creature 's piteous air , Her Grace bought it on the spot . Last fortnight she displayed it to her royal house guests , who beheld a nag still old , but now sleek and roly-poly . <P> Ordinarily the King 's note to His Grace of Portland would not have been made public ; but in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed by the good people of Nottinghamshire . <P> Therefore the Royal &; Imperial bread was publicly spread extra thick , last week , with the best butter : " ... very enjoyable stay . . . the Queen and I have appreciated the loyal and enthusiastic reception . . . the true English welcome which we will never forget . . . accorded us by the people of Nottinghamshire . . . . <P> " We especially enjoyed watching the bright faces and listening to the merry voices of the thousands of children . . . enormous crowds . . . delightful experience . . fine weather .
