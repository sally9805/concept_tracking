The Story . When the war was over , when Troy was a city of smoke , Menelaus found Helen and they set sail together , over the ever-moving sea , for Greece . Aithra , the sorceress , was watching them . She called the winds to bring them to her and they came at night , when the palace was dark and the sky was full of storm . <P> Menelaus had been meaning to kill Helen for her treachery but the rain and the furious waves made him forget his fury . In Aithra 's castle drugs made him dream again of stabbing Paris and murdering the casual queen . When he awoke , Helen was lying on a magic couch and he loved her still . Aithra , a witch of kind enchantments , used a charm and made them both gay , forgetting the past . <P> Helen sang softly while Menelaus was still asleep . They were in a palm grove now , at the foot of an Egyptian mountain where Aithra had carried them by her airy conjurings . Soon she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying presents for the queen . Menelaus was tired of watching men who looked at his wife with an inviting adoration . The chiefs , with their presents , made him sad and jealous . <P> <P> Helen brewed a cup that would make Menelaus recapture the quietude and comfort that perilous journeyings had stolen . She persuaded him to drink it ; the king remembered then the peace he had known before the ships sailed , before the soldiers fought under the city 's wall . <P> This is the story of The Egyptian Helen , an opera by Richard Strauss and Hugo Von Hofmannstahl , which was last week performed for the first time , in Dresden . <P> The Music . The prelude was bitter and clamorous ; a music of heathen sorrow , sharp , scornful , without pity . Then the curtains opened on the castle and the angry music grew less terrible ; when Helen and Menelaus entered the dark castle , there was no sound . Later the music was sweet , tender ; colored with languor and regret , sometimes derivative and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang to her sleeping lover , the song was no longer pretty ; rich , beautiful , full of hunger and a strange serenity , it leaned and shivered , a beckoning song , as lovely as a tree , as full of life . The desert warriors brought their gifts with a martial music ; only at the last , the sorceress and the two she had befriended sang of gentle ease , a contentment long denied ; . then the strings were hushed and the horns sounded softly . <P> The Cast . Elisabeth Rethberg sang the title role ; her voice , rich rather than subtle , was suited for the regal role . Her appearance , too , was shining and graceful . In the moment of entering the quiet castle she seemed almost a Helen of Dresden china-until she began to sing . Curt Taucher was Menelaus ; a little too noisy , like almost all Germanic tenors , he made the tired king imperiously stalwart . Maria Rajdl sang the part of Aithra ; even when she was mixing the draughts and potions upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has sampled the punch which it is her business to brew . <P> The Composer . Richard Strauss , *if he was pleased with the plaudits which came ringing up to him from the pit , made no show of his delight . Moody , vain , mercenary , sarcastic , selfish , solitary , ruddy of countenance and scornful of demeanor , he has always appeared to detest the adulation which the people who listen to his music have given him , without liking him the better .
