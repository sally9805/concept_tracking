Fifteen years ago Wall Street was Arcady for Richard D. Wyckoff . He had a good name-editor and financier . He had a magazine , a big bank book , a glass-topped desk . And he had a pretty brunette for stenographer . <P> Last week he crawled into court and confessed that the pretty brunette has everything that once was his : name , magazine , bank book , glass-topped desk , stenographers aplenty of her own . He wanted some of it back again . <P> The story is familiar enough in the financial district of New York , where the memory of Wyckoff hovers ghostlike in many an office corner , and the name of Cecelia G. Wyckoff is flaunted fortnightly at the masthead of the Magazine of Wall Street . The chapters of it fall into the following sequence : <P> In 1888 Wyckoff made his debut in the district , getting a job as messenger for a firm of brokers . Clever lad , apt student , he was in due course a broker on his own , functioning in a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phonograph Co . By 1907 when he started to publish the Ticker Magazine he had acquired a reputation for smartness and a considerable fortune . <P> Shortly thereafter came scintillant Cecelia Gertrude Shere , waving dark locks , out of the West in quest of fame . <P> Grand opera was the dream of this girl from Detroit . Between vocalizings , however , she found it necessary to get a job , and she got one in the office of blithe , clever Editor Wyckoff . She became his stenographer and secretary . <P> Now even more sunny than ever he-came Wall Street to Wyckoff . A sympathetic understanding blossomed quickly between the onetime phonograph promoter and the would-be prima donna . It might have been music . At any rate it grew and grew , until the then Mrs. Wyckoff thought best to inquire . <P> Sweet and Low . In her subsequent suit for divorce , Mrs. Aleminia Wyckoff alleged that she had hired a private detective to follow her husband to the source of his happiness . The detective traced him one evening to a house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . Gaining admission to the apartment in the morning , in the role of gasman , the detective found Wyckoff still there . <P> Mrs. Wyckoff named Cecelia Shere corespondent in her suit , which was granted in 1913 . <P> About this time , Wyckoff said , his stenographer tenderly wooed 25% of the stock in the Ticker Publishing Co. from him . And when , in August of 1913 , he and Cecelia Shere were wed , on the very day of the happy nuptials , with arms twined about his neck , she graciously accepted 25% more . <P> More and more gallant did Wyckoff become . He bought nine and a half acres at Great Neck , L. L , and built a $250,000 home , all of which at his young wife 's gentle suggestion he put in her name . In 1916 he assigned to her the balance of the stock of the Ticker Publishing Co. , except for i% which he kept . <P> Finally he agreed with her that she should be manager of the magazine , which by now had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , while he would be editor , at $18,000 . It was stipulated that if she should ever ask him to resign , he would do so . His resignation came soon .
