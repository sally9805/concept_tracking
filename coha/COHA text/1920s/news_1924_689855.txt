txt Your recent article entitled " Discount Corporation of New York " ta of great interest to inc . I should like you to tell ins what tats corporation is . I have no doubt it is what the name implies , but what is the real nature of the business of the Corporation referred to ? It occurred to me that there fa a good held for a similar one in this territory . Discount Corporation of New York discounts approved bankers ' acceptances and trade acceptances with bank endorsements . It buys and sells all short term government obligations . It receives funds repayable on demand or at fixed maturity against the security of bankers ' acceptances or government obligations . It acts as sort of " back log " in the bill market , tending to absorb an oversupply , or to feed out bills . to the market when it displays a. readiness to take them . In this way it exercises a very stabilizing effect upon the market , and performs a service similar to that of the great discount houses of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world center for liquid banking funds . Although there are several banking institutions and firms , both here and elsewhere , which undertake to deal in substantially the same class of paper as the Discount Corporation , a requisite to a successful discount bank is the availability of a world money center , where are represented many foreign banks and agents to afford a goodsupply of bankers ' bills . At present , New York City might be said to be trying to establish itself as such a world money center , with considerable success it is true , but not such as to encourage the establishment of other like concerns here . QUALIFIED /FLIGHT ON 1111NIL orrocic 26748 ? on March 1 , 1323 . I owned 15 shares of the capital stork of a national bank . that selling at $400 a share . Capitalization was $100,000. and undivided profits $300,000 . On 4pril 5. 1953 , the capital was increased to ** under the following plan : .4 stock dividend of 100e. representing 1.000 shares at $100 per share front the undivided profits of the bank Stockholders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the increased capital stock , which portion of the stock was sold for the suns of 5350 per share , of which amount the sum of $150 was paid to the waiving stockholders and the balance of $500 upon each share credited to undivided profits of the bank . I received for my 15 shares which I held ** additional shares , and the rights for 7 ' , gharcs which I sold back to the bank for $150 a share , or $1.1115 . I purchased a half share from the bank for $175 , and now hold E3 shares . On December 31 , 1923 , the bank had a capitalization of $000,000 , with surplus of 0300.000 and undivided profits of over $700,000 , although nothing /vas transferred to surplus from the divided profits profits during 1923 . In January of 191$. the surplus was increased to $500,000 , from money taken from undivided profits . I understand that I do not have to account for the 7.4 shares given me as a stock dividend until such time as I may dispose of them , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subscribe to 1$0% , or 7% saarear ? P " . B.S. Whatever the adjustment may be so far as the capitalization of the corporation is concerned , in relation to its surplus and undivided profits , the sole question that concerns you as in holder of 23 shares of stock is ? what does the $1,125 you received in cash represent ? There seems no doubt but that you received a true stock dividend of 50% in the form of 7% new shares , and the corporation 's capital is increased in proportion . These shares are not ' income when received and any profit realized upon sale of any of the 22% shares you then had will be computed in the usual way per share ; that is. when you sell them you figure your profit per share on the basis of the total-numbeY , 22% , divided into the cost of the original 15 shares , assuming they were purchased after March 1 , 1913 . The question is whether or not the " rights " to subscribe to 7% additional shares were real rights and subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rights . Obviously they were not , as they did not carry with them the privilege of subscribing to stock which rights imply . It was known and understood by you that as a result of the transaction the stockholders could not subscribe for additional stock and they were in the position of any outsiders who , to acquire any of the new stock , - could do so by paying the full price of $350 per share . What appears to have happened in effect then is that you received a cash dividend of $1,125 which came out of surplus and undivided profits accumulated after March 1 , 1913 , and it is therefore taxable as a dividend , subject to surtax . This represents a proportionate distribution to all the stockholders of money on the stock they already hold and is in the nature of a cash dividend . Even where a transaction has the appearance of a true stock dividend and an absolute proportionate distribution of new stock representing increased capitalization does not take place , the rulings are strict in calling it a cash dividend , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of cash in new stuck representing an increased capitalization . A similar situation occurs in your case . You have no right inherent in your holdings to subscribe to or to receive the new stock above the amount actually - Iseued to you as a dividend . What you have is a right . or a certificate , or whatever you wish to call it , entitling you to receive an amount of cash in proportion to your holdings , the same as any stockholder . This reduces it to an ordinary cash dividend and the full amount is taxable . The new half share you bought for 517 ' 5 ' , which any outsider might have done under the arrangement as outlined , is a separate operation . When you sell it you figure it as costing you $175 apart from the other 2234 shares of old and new stock , and compute gain or loss on ' this basis of cost . The other 22% shards will be treated in the manner described .               @ @ @ @ @ @
