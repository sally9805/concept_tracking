" Elphege Daignault , the excommunicate , will repent . He will come back into the Church . " <P> Last week in Providence , R. I. , and in the half-dozen towns surrounding , the whisper softly passed around . In smart houses it caused slight comment . But in little houses where shirt-sleeved fathers read the papers every night by the centre table , the whisper was tense , freighted with excitement . " Elphege Daignault will repent . The neighbors told me . " <P> Good Catholic wives glanced at the crucifix on the wall , tried not to think of excommunicates . <P> Elphege Daignault is an attorney-at-law with offices in the Longley Building , Woonsocket . Like most of the 290,540 Catholics who live in and near Providence he is a French-Canadian . And , like most of Providence 's French-Canadians , he gave money in 1925 for a school fund which was to be distributed by the Rt . Rev. William A. Hickey , Bishop of the Diocese of Providence . Attorney Daignault and many another donor wanted strictly French-speaking schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken , though French was taught . Attorney Daignault and a few of his comrades were so vexed that they determined to sue Bishop Hickey for misuse of their good money . <P> They appealed to His Excellency , Most Rev. Pietro Fumasoni-Biondi , apostolic delegate at Washington , and then to the Holy See , where their suit was denied . Then they went to a secular Rhode Island court and then to the State Supreme Court . <P> In the U. S. , the civil law respects canon law as it applies to the internal affairs of a church. * Therefore since the Catholic court had ruled against Attorney Daignault and friends , the Rhode Island courts did likewise . Attorney Daignault lost his case . Worse , he had been responsible for the appearance in a secular court of a Catholic Bishop as defendant . <P> Came a letter addressed to Elphege Daignault : " . . . the Sacred Congregation of the Council has ordered me to notify you that . . . you have incurred the penalty of excommunication . ... In communicating this to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may realize the gravity of your fault , and hasten to liberate yourself from the penalty which it has brought upon you . " Yours very sincerely , " P. Fumasoni-Biondi . " Attorney Daignault became an outcast from his Church . To get reinstated he had humbly , sincerely to repent . Last week in Rhode Island they whispered that Dainault had at last repented , begged forgiveness , that Mother Church would once more take him as a son . <P> *In the U.S. , for instance , Gen. Bramwell Booth ( see col. 3 ) could expect no hearing from secular courts because the Salvation Army 's High Council deposed him justly according to the Army 's own canons.
