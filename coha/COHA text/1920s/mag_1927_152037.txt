International Repercussions <P> Citizens of almost every European state experienced last week distinct repercussions from the murder of Soviet Minister to Poland Peter Lazarevitch Vojkov at Warsaw ( TIME , June 20 ) . <P> In Poland . The Government of Polish Dictator Josef Pilsudski flatly refused last week , a demand by the Soviet Government that one of its agents be allowed to participate at the trial in Warsaw of Boris Kovenko , the confessed assassin of M. Vojkov . How dared small Poland thus flout great Russia ? <P> Observers thought it certain that Polish Foreign Minister August Zaleski must have obtained strong assurances of support from France and Britain . This he did , presumably , at one of the secret sessions last week of the Council of the League of Nations . <P> Meanwhile , in Warsaw , Assassin Boris Kovenko declared to the Special Tribunal which sat upon his case : " I killed M. Vojkov , but I did not kill him as a person . I killed him because of what the Bolshevists have done in Russia . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that although 19-year-old Assassin Kovenko is now an anti-Communist he once served in the Soviet Army ; 2 ) that his character is " highly excitable " but " entirely honorable . " <P> The hearing proceeded from 10 a.m. until midnight , almost without a break . Then Assassin Kovenko was sentenced to life imprisonment , the Court , however , recommending that this be commuted to 15 years . In Moscow . Promptly , the Soviet Workers ' Gazette , Moscow , headlined : " Unheard-of mild sentence , which Kovenko hears with beaming face . Murder for which the Polish Government is responsible covered by Polish court . " <P> Editorially the Gazette said : " Behind this base action is hidden a hand which wanted Vojkov 's blood to provoke a war and the sentence is a concession to the die-hard lunatics . Let the Poles remember it is dangerous to play with fire . " <P> This was , of course , an allusion to the formal charges of the Soviet Government last fortnight that Britain means to launch war upon the Soviets and maintains " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called " British terror " the Soviet continued its adroitly named " counter terror . " A score of alleged " British spies " were reported sentenced to death in Russia last week , notably one " Commander Klepikov of a ship in the Baltic fleet , who sold information to the British for 10 ( $48.60 ) . " <P> In Britain . The British House of Commons echoed all week with questions &; answers about Russia . Examples : <P> Robert Spear Hudson , M. P. ( Conservative back-bencher ) : " I am sure the Government will wish to answer with a definite ' yes ' or ' no ' whether any of the unfortunate persons executed in Russia as ' spies ' were in our employ . " <P> Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Godfrey Lampson Tennyson Locker-Lampson ( crisply ) : " No . " <P> Campbell Stephen , M. P. ( Laborite ) : " Do you say that the British Mission at Moscow employed no spies at all ? " <P> Mr. Locker-Lampson : " Certainly not ! "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
