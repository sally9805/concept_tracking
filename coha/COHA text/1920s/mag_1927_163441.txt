14 Billion Ton <P> Wyoming knew it had coal beds in its northeastern corner but it did not know how big they were . Last week , Wyoming and the U. S. learned that Wyoming has nearly as much coal as all the coal that was ever mined in the U. S. <P> The Department of the Interior published a report by Geologists C. E. Dobbin , V. H. Barnett and W. T. Thom Jr . of the U. S. Geological Survey . They said that the 75-foot coal seams near Minturn , Wyo. , are only part of huge system of seams embracing Campbell , Crook , Weston , Toniobrara and Converse Counties , which contain some 14 billion tons . Some 17.8 billion tons is the U. S. coal mining total to date . <P> At Gillette , Wyo. , as at Minturn and elsewhere in the region , the coal deposits are on or near the earth 's surface . A few country mines are operating . Ranchers have long scraped what they needed for household fires from outcroppings in bluffs and streambeds . Large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above . Tunnelling will seldom be necessary . <P> The Gillette field is crossed by the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy R. R. on the north . The Chicago &; Northwestern R. R. passes within 25 miles of its southern edge . None of the coal is more than 60 miles from shipping point . <P> In grade , the Gillette coal is a sub-bituminous kind called black lignite-tough , deliquescent , easily crumbled when exposed to air , when it also tends to combust spontaneously . Storage of it requires a special technic , but since one-third of its weight is water it is cheaply shipped after treatment . Valuable by-products result and the coal itself-or some like it-has been found serviceable in specially built locomotives , by the C. B. &; Q. and the Chicago &; Northwestern R. R. 's Much of the Gillette field is owned by the U. S. , which can lease it under the mineral lease law of 1920 . <P> The Superintendent of Documents , Washington , D. C. , stands ready to furnish copies of the Geological Survey 's report .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
