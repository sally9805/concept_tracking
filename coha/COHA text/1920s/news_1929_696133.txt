Partly by his own actions and principally by being a cog in a vast wheel of corruption , his future had been darkened , his career suddenly ended and he preferred to go into the shadows by his own hand . In a burst of despair he dashed down his burden and entered into oblivion . " It is not our duty to criticize and to judge . I stand before you as the rabbi of Park Avenue Synagogue , and I claim David Steinhardt as a friend and a member of that organization . The revelations of the last few weeks can not undo a life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentle , affectionate son and a loyal friend . Death is the complete atonement . "
