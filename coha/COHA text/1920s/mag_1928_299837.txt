TEKIAH SHEBARIM TERUAH TEKIAH <P> TEKIAH SHEBARIM TEKIAH TEKIAH TERUAH TEKIAH GEDOLAH <P> Happy is the people that knoweth the sound of the trumpet ; in the light of thy countenance , O Lord , shall they walk . <P> In the synagogue the rabbi stands before his people like a Semitic tribal chief .

It is the call to Jews , their reminder that God created the world out of a void and howling darkness 5,689 years ago . Rosh Hashonah , the New Year , opens ; the Book of Life is closed upon the passed year . <P> The Book closes on the year 5688 Anno Mundi Friday evening Sept. 14 .

Jews discouraged ; Jewish education aggressively pushed throughout the U. S. ; a non-religious renaissance of Hebrew culture everywhere . Jews have become exuberant and expansive in the happy circumstance of tolerance . Their chief fear now is that a politico-economic condition might insidiously arise to throttle them again .

Jew or non-Jew who will have contributed most to the interests of U. S. Jews during the year ending Dec. 1 , 1928 . <P> Although the year has been so good to Jews there are private sins and old religious woes to weep over . And this the communicants will do ten days after Rosh Hashonah - on Yom Kippur ( Day of Atonement ) , which begins at sunset Sept. 23 . It is a vigil of fasting and repentance , to be concluded with the cry : " May he who maketh peace in his high places , make peace for us and for all Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
