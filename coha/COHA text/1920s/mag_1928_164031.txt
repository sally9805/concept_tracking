So pleased was President Abbott Lawrence Lowell of Harvard University on being shown some broken 100-year-old dinner plates dug up in the backyard of University Hall , that he ordered the Wedgewood Potteries of Staffordshire , England , to manufacture 42,000 old-fashioned plates bearing pictures of new Harvard buildings . Many of these plates will be sold to loyal sons of John Harvard .
