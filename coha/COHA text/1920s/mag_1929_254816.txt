Brown-haired , deep-dimpled Fraulein Lisl Goldarbeiter , recently chosen " Miss Austria " by a group of enthusiastic Viennese artists , was the recipient last week of an impassioned letter from the Right Reverend Christopher Edward Byrne , Bishop of Galveston , Tex . <P> " The Galveston Beauty Contest , " blurted Bishop Byrne , " is an uncouth vulgar display . No Galveston lady enters it . Very many frown upon it . You will be called upon to parade in nothing but a bathing suit before a motley crowd which will view you at close range . I can not see how any self-respecting , modest young lady could enter such a contest . " <P> Sloe-eyed Fraulein Goldarbeiter , at her home near the Stefansdom , thoughtfully pondered this letter from a man she had not met . " I am profoundly impressed . " she said , " but I think I will enter the contest anyway . "
