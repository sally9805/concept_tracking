txt " The Yankee of the Yards , " by Louis P. Swift in colinhoro ( fon with Arthur ' Van Vlissingen Jr . ( Shaw . ) Ono of the favorite moans of the older generation Is that things are n't what they used to be . Statistics carefully gathered would probably prey , : that those same words were used when Horace was smiting his blooming lyre . In a word , things are n't what they used to be , and they never were . But that there is a tremor ? ! dous amount of truth back of the com , plaint has never been more vividly evidenced than in this story of the founder of Swift &; Co . Business certainly is n't what It used to be in ibis day , any more than the Amer ( ican family is what it used to be in the eighties . The patriarch , who ruled his family with the well known rod of ! Iron , and who was never known to spare the rod , is a figure which , iehough no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every family . The business patriarch , who carried into his industry the same powers of absolutism , is likewise a figure of the past . Gustavus F. Swift was , by the evi. ! donee of this book , such a patriarch , the czar of the group who worked for him , but feeling , as the obverse of the picture , the kind of personal patriarchal responsibility for his men and his business which is simply not found in modern industrial life . There Is something tangy about such a figure . To be able to be absolutely the ruler , do things which on the face of them seem unfair and meddling and penurious , but still to be understood by his family of workers as never being unfair and meddling , only eager for Perfection . and to be able to offer the head butcher the week 's profits if he I would rather have them than the wages he thought were ? Insufficient , and to have the whole , organization get the point of the offer and relish it pictures a character which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old G. F. as they must all have ( called him was a picturesque yarn . As a tenacious realizer of his dream he also belonged to the days when qnc of the chief maxims was that God helps those who help themselves . He wanted a tremendous business , and despite reverses which threatened  --  for years  --  almost daily destruction , he blindly plowed on to his goal . His son says that he believes that if his father had realized the obstacles , or ever for a. moment looked them squarely in the eye , he would have failed . But he refused to admit that anything but success was possible . There is a classic story of the time when the Board of Trade ticker gave out the news that Swift &; Co. had failed . As soon as he heard it he jumped into his carriage , raced down town , walked on to the trading floor , said in his powerful voice , " Swift &; Co. has not failed . Swift &; CO. can not fail , " and walked out , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of bankers who were determined to call all of his loans  --  well over his negotiable assets at the moment ? and his frank and successful " I 'm sorry , gentlemen , but we have to have more money , not less . It is up to you to lend it to us . If we do n't get it we go down  --  and a good many of you go down with us " is yeasty with his personality . Gustavus F. Swift 's business methods were in many cases , the exact opposite of current practices , but , as his son keenly says , the cardinal principles of success were in them . And the fact that he succeeded so thoroughly as he did makes his story extremely interesting . Unlike what it might have been  --  a prejudiced tribute to his father ? Mr. Louis Swift 's book is done with affection , but not at all with obvious hero worship . He saw the amusing side of the martinet as well as the impressive one of the born leader .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
