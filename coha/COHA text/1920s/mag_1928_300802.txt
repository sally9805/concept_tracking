( See front cover ) <P> From Paris , last week , came reports of feverish activity around the Place Vendme and , particularly , along that brief but important , severe but incredibly expensive street known as the Rue de la Paix . Crowds milled about sternly-guarded doorways ; ultra-fashionable women sought admission as to the most coveted box at the Opera ; Parisian celebrities entered with an air of triumph , emerged with subdued cries of " Oh ! " and " Ah ! " <P> To the Parisian , even to the accustomed tourist , the mle in the Rue de la Paix was not unfamiliar . Similar scenes had been observable just a year ago , and again last February . As every true follower of fashion knows , there are two months in the year when the couturiers open their magnificent salons to the view of a favored few , display their latest triumphs of design , reveal what the well-dressed woman will wear for the next six months . <P> Many a fortunate Parisian hastened , last week , from the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband that no matter how chic she might appear in his eyes , in truth she would be in rags unless her wardrobe conformed to these newly-pronounced edicts . <P> Color .

Three designs , all applied to small , close-fitting hats , share the approval of the French fashion makers . A pronounced slant downward on the right side , occasionally obscuring the vision of the right eye , is a mark of a correct hat , as is the bonnet shape , and an imitation of the French peasant 's beret . <P> Formal Dress . Since the War , it has been permissible , though not desirable , for women to wear the same gown at a luncheon or at an afternoon tea , at dinner or at a ball . This year , pre-War distinctions are again in evidence . With more money to spend on clothes , the well-dressed woman will have rich and luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
