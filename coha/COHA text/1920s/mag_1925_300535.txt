An editorial writer spoke of " that Big-time Melody Three , Insull , Ford and Wanamaker , " in commenting on the fact that each of these three famous men was mentioned in the musical news of last week . <P> Henry Ford sat beside his wife in the fine front-parlor of his home in Dearborn , Mich. , and heard Mellie Dunham , champion fiddler of Maine , play " Money Musk . " Fiddler Dunham had been imported in a special Pullman all the way to Michigan to contribute to Mr. Ford 's appetite for country tunes and " racy " U. S. music . Fiddler Dunham is an old man ; his fingers are gnarled from making snowshoes ; his white mustache is so long that he tucks it under his fiddle before he plays . He struck up " Turkey in the Straw . " Mr. Ford snapped his fingers , knocked his knees together , and twiddled his foot on the floor . A reporter stepped forward : <P> " What do you think of Mellie 's playing , Mr. Ford ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you thing of his violin , Mr. Ford ? " <P> " It is a first-rate violin . " <P> Rodman Wanamaker bought four Stradivarius violins , " Conte La Chesnaie " ( 1687 ) , " Dancla " ( 1710 ) , " Joachim " ( 1723 ) , and that consummately powerful and resonant violin which is called " The Swan " because it is the last one the master-carver made before he died . It bears the inscription , " In My Ninety-Third Year . " Mr. Wanamaker will not use these instruments himself . They will be played in concerts in the auditoriums of Wanamaker Stores in Manhattan , Philadelphia . <P> Samuel Insull asked the Chicago Association of Commerce if it did not think that Chicago needed a new opera house ; suggested plans for one which would cost $7,500,000 exclusive of land costs . He went smoothly on to ask for a guarantee of $500,000 annually for the Civic Opera .
