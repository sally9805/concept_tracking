President Coolidge , Senator James A. Reed of Missouri , Democratic firebrand , Senator William E. Borah of Idaho , Republican man-of-all-words , spoke in the same room in Washington , D. C. , one night last week . Some 150 newsmen heard them . Yet not a word of what they said appeared in the public prints . It was the annual winter dinner of the Gridiron Club ; at such a function the club beards itself with the phrase , " reporters are never present . " <P> Members of the Gridiron Club are , nonetheless , reporters . They entertain their distinguished dinner guests ( politicians , diplomats , businessmen ) with horseplay . <P> Last week , the horseplay had chiefly to do with the late election . There was a parody of Herbert Hoover 's campaign eulogy of the U. S. home : ' T was the night before Christmas , when all through the house <P> Not a creature was sleeping , not even a <P> mouse . <P> The glasses were set on the mantel with <P> care <P> In hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children were dancing to KDKA <P> For six brand new tubes had been purchased that day , <P> And mamma with her diamonds and I with <P> two trumps , <P> Were winning a hand from a couple of <P> chumps . . . . <P> I 'm sure you 'll agree there 's no need for <P> Saint Nick , <P> With a person named Hoover to do us the <P> trick . <P> But I hear him exclaim ere he drove out <P> of sight <P> " Happy hokum to all-and to all a good <P> night ! " <P> There was a definition : " A Nordic is a Southern Democrat who takes a good stiff shot of 100 per cent American corn-and then votes for Hoover . " <P> There was a comparison : " Grant was more magnanimous than Mr. Hoover . He left us Southerners our horses ; Hoover took our shirts . "
