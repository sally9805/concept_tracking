Back to jail went Ben Bess , South Carolina 's most conspicuous contemporary Negro . Ben Bess first went to jail for a 30-year term in 1915 , on the testimony of a white-trash woman named Maude Collins who swore he had raped her . Last spring Ben Bess was pardoned by Governor Richards after Maude Collins had signed an affidavit saying her original testimony was false ( TIME , June 11 ) . <P> Indignation was widespread in South Carolina and Maude Collins heard that Governor Richards was wondering if she had not committed perjury in the first instance . Frightened , she retracted her retraction , said she had signed the affidavit without knowing what it said , in return for $50 from Ben Bess 's wife . The Bess side explained that Maude Collins had refused to sign anything unless she got paid . But Circuit Court Judge W. H. Townsend last week decided that the $50 was bribery , that bribery " vitiates " all things , even a Governor 's pardon .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
