txt Expressing some resentment a t personal attacks on him by political opponents , Mayor Walker in two apeeches yesterday asserted that , he had visited a night club in this cit3i. , only three times since he bees:vie : Mayor . Each time , he said , was on . ' his wedding anniversary at the suggestion of Mrs. Walker . The Mayor struck back at critics of his attire and personal conduct at the luncheon of the Mozart Society at the Hotel Astor and at the campaign luncheon of the Women 's Democratic Club at the Commodore , his audience at both places being mostly women . " I have been called Jimmy the Jester , the Night Club Mayor and the Tango Mayor , " Mayor Walker said . " Take the assertions of my political opponent that I am a night club habitu ? . I am not ? sensitive shGut it , but on that , as well as upon the real issues of the campaign , the constructive achivements of our administration , my opponents are further away than Sheridan ever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Walker , who attended the luncheon at the Astor , the Mayor continued : " Since Jan. 1 , 1926 . I have been in a night ? club just three times . Upon each occasion it was our wedding anniversity . I 'm not trying to alibi myself . I 'm giving some one else the credit . She had sense enough to think of it . " As for being a tango Mayor , I tried the tango once several years ago and sprained my ankle . " Mrs. Walker led in the laughter that followed . " The things that the administration has done in the last few years , the record , should be the test of the administration , " Mayor Walker continued . " If the record is not satisfactory , then . the administration is not satisfactory and its members do not deserve re-election . If the record is satisfactory  --  and I believe the majority of . the voters will decide that it has been  --  then we deserve re-election . " There has n't been any objection to the record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . There are some who are not interested in the record . Their complaint against the present Mayor is that he wears clothes . I must admit that ; I thought that was a matter between myself and my tailor and that it ended there . " I wouldni+ care if the cashier of my bank wore baggy trousers so long as the money was safe . I would n't care if he wore a frock coat and a top hat , so long as the money was safe . I would be willing to wear a jumper and overalls if I thought it would be any benefit to the city and its people . " Call me a play boy if you will . I 'll take time off to play when it 's playtime , but I 'll work when it 's work time . " There are n't enough laughs in life to suit me . There are too many tears . I think the people of this great city would rather have their Chief Magistrate smiling than grouchy . At ' Dinners 250 Nights . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have repeatedly hurried home from City Hall at the close of each business day , changed my clothes like a fireman and hurried away to the dinner of this or that charitable organization : The record will show that I have passed more than 250 nights in this man- net .. and I wish to say that I believe it is part of the duty of the Mayor to help in any way he can the groups of persons who are spending their time and money for various philanthropic purposes . The thing that irks me is that I am criticized by those who never showed any tendency to help . " I am going to live in this city for the rest of my life . I do n't want to lose the respect of any self-respecting person because of this whispered talk about me , not so much on my own account as on account of those who belong to me . I ca n't be made to appear to be a scoundrel on their account . " The May:or reviewed the work of his administration , citing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the welfare work , the improvement of the health and hospital departments and the many public improvements , constructed and projected , as part of the record on which he and his colleagues asked reelection . " I feel better , " he said , after he had finished speaking of the personal attacks on him . " Going back to the record and the story in it , it is my hope that the people of the city will recognize what we have done during the last four years and will decide that the Mayor , the Controller . the President of the Board of Aldermen , the Borough President of Manhattan and the other Democratic candidates are good enough for them . " Mrs. A. Frank Imhof , president of the Women 's Democratic Club , presided at the luncheon at the Commodore , and Mrs. George H. Childs , former president , introduced Mayor Walker and Joseph V. , President of the Board of Aldermen . At the Hotel Astor luncheon , Mrs. Noble McConnell , founder of the Mozart Society , announced that Mayor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Guardia in Brooklyn . At a meeting in Brooklyn last night , Mayor Walker delivered the most stinging attack he had yet directed at Fiorella H. La Guardia , though in his entire speech he did not mention the name of his Republican opponent for the Mayoralty . He accused Mr. La ? Guardia of vilifying and misquoting him in a manner which made it impossible for him to keep his good humor . Mayor Walker 's speech was delivered after he had listened earlier in the evening to an address by Mr. La Guardia over the radio . Mayor Walker spoke in Prospect Hall at Fifth and Prospect Avenues , Brooklyn . Twenty-five hundred persons crowded the hall , and there was a large overflow crowd outside . Of Mr. La Guardia , the Mayor decla red : " I have had all sorts of opponents during the twenty years of my political career . They have been gentlemen for the large part . I have had men who were bitter partisan opponents . I have had men who were hectic , stinging , but the one I listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of all the exaggerations , of all the misquotations I ever listened to in all my life , I heard them tonight . " " Can any one expect me to keep my good-nature in this campaign ever again , to recognize a man even by proxy who apparently has not enough dignity , enough decency and enough self-respect to tell but one on-thousandth part of the truth ? " I have run against many kinds of men , but this is the first time that I have ever had an opponent among my fellow-men who resorted to slander , vilification and vulgarity that are not fit to enter any decent home that I have ever been in . " " It has been suggested to me that I tell you what he said , " the Mayor continued . " He is the only one wha could say those things . You know any man can pronounce himself a great fighter . Oh , he is going to chase everybody . He is going to rout the army of Democracy  --  this Goliath  --  all alone . How can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart ? Who was ever courageous who was not fair ? Oh . what is there in public office that will make men forget every element of decency they have to win that office ? If they ca n't be fair winning it .. what could you expect from them after they have it ? It never has been done and it never will be done . and so while in the goodness of my heart , and perhaps for the gayety of the nation  --  I mean the city  --  I was willing to stoop down into the gutter and try to get them out of it for the purpose of debate in this campaign , here and now in your presence I refuse to go any further than the gutter . I will not go down in a sewer . " Before launching this attack on Mr. La Guardia , he remarked that he had heard complaints from his friends of his manner of conducting his campaign . They had said that he was too serious , Mr. Walker said , that he was too much given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , he had considered that it was his duty to give the voters an accounting of his administration , so that they could pass judgment with understanding . Compliments Norman Thomas . Referring to his Republican opponent as " the forces of confusion , " the Mayor warned Republicans dissatisfied with the Republican candidate that by voting for Norman Thomas , the Socialist nominee , to whom he referred personally in complimentary terms , they were really encouraging what he termed " the dangerous forces of socialism . " " Of course , it is not hard to understand how the regular Socialist candidate would attract some discontented voters , because he at least is an intelligent gentleman . He at least gives the rest of us credit for having some intelligence , and the people have the satisfaction of feeling that if he were elected we would at least have dignity and self-respect in the City Hall and not hoodlumism and rowdyism that is promised by the Republican candidate .
