The choicest modern achievements of U. S. statecraft and of French art were blended , last week , in the great liner Ile de France , homeward bound from the U. S. toward France . <P> One year ago , on her maiden voyage , this same ship brought from France to the U. S. a proposal that the two nations should solemnly renounce war between themselves . The French note was carried personally by tall , grizzled , beloved Myron Timothy Herrick , who is still U. S. Ambassador at Paris and was then a co-hero of the hour with Charles Augustus Lindbergh . Furthermore , the interior decorations and furnishings of the Ile de France brought to U. S. citizens the first great , coordinated example of what is called in France L'Art Moderne and in the U. S. " Modernistic Art . " Some like it , and some do not ; but within the past twelvemonth it has swept all other schools of decoration out of smartest U. S. shopwindows and has become at least a " craze " among the rich. * <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maiden voyage of the Ile de France . Last week they viewed her homeward voyage with interest , for she carried U. S. Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg , who was en route to sign at Paris the Multilateral Treaty to Renounce War as an Instrument of National Policy , which he created by expanding the original French proposal , brought last year on the Ile de France ( TIME , July 11 , 1927 ) . <P> Vicissitudes . Both the Treaty and the ship have had to weather grueling vicissitudes during the past twelvemonth . The tribulations of Mr. Kellogg are well known ; but only keenest observers realize that a crafty and at times successful " whispering campaign " has been waged against the Ile de France-the sixth-largest ship in the world . <P> The cause of this " whispering " begins to appear when one realizes that the five ships larger than the Ile de France are all old ( pre-War ) - and that in the shipping business " newness " sells cabins . Therefore enthusiasts for the " Biggest Five " were quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her sailings had to be cancelled , in order that her machinery might be tinkered with . <P> The cancellations made it possible to insinuate that French ship mechanisms are not the best , whatever may be thought of French ship art . ( The five liners larger than the Ile de France are , of course , of German and British construction . ) <P> Such whispering continued until the French Line , goaded beyond endurance , finally issued a pamphlet entitled " Two Hundred and Forty Thousand Reasons for the Laying Up of the Ile De France . " The figure 240,000 is an allusion to the number of tiny blades on the rotors of a steamship turbine . Indeed one of these giant power plants may be likened to a series of steam-driven windmills , all on the same shaft , all spinning at high speed , and with a clearance of only a few thousandths of an inch between windmill blades and steam ducts . Obviously , if a single one of the thousands of blades breaks off , the terrific steam pressure hurtles it against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break others . Thus , within a few seconds , the great 59,000-h.p. mechanism strips its blades , jams , and can not be repaired without months of skilled work .
