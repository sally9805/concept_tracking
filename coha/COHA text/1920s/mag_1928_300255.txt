Theoretically , the newspaperman belongs to a " fourth estate , " proud in its antecedents , jealous for its membership , mighty in affairs . Actually he binds his toga with shoelace and a piece of string , and now and then he must take to his heels with some irate mere first-or second-estater grabbing at the frayed vestment . <P> In the exercise of his profession , he is curiously without legal protection , or social position . According to the whim of the moment the man he interviews may paste him at the first question , or sneer , or smile . If the reporter develops as a result of this a cynical contempt for all the other estates , a perpetual grouch , an inferiority complex , it is not surprising . <P> That inferiority complex betrayed itself in many New York papers , last week , from parenthetical bad-boy chuckles to grandiose editorial anathema , in stories of a tilt between John Pierpont Morgan and ship-news reporters and cameramen , aboard the Olympic , docking 16 hours late from Southampton . <P> Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Morgan , was Miss Elizabeth Morrow , daughter of Ambassador to Mexico Dwight W. Morrow . Rumors that Miss Morrow , 25 , or her sister , Anne , 22 , was to marry Col. Lindbergh had been printed . Lindbergh was a guest of Ambassador Morrow in Mexico City . The ship-news reporters were instructed to ask Miss Morrow all about it . <P> Came a knock at the door of her suite . She opened it . " Are you going to marry him ? " chorused the reporters , trigger-fingers quivering on their pencils . Miss Morrow laughed . " Hold that pose ! " chorused the cameramen , shaking powder in their flashlight pans . <P> At this point a door opened and through it strode a tall , heavy man of magnificent carriage , instantly recognizable as John Pierpont Morgan . He was smoking a comfortably big meerschaum pipe , but his visage was not benign . He spoke : " This is an infernal outrage . . . . You fellows get along . " <P> Several photographs , however , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Alone among the newspapers the tabloid Daily News ( biggest circulation in the U. S. ) vented its wrath in a stern editorial , betrayed the liveliest inferiority complex . It baited Messrs . Morgan &; Morrow with representing both the U. S. and Wall Street in Mexico , and climaxed : " By such toplofty behavior Mr. Morgan only got himself into a scene where he had not been invited , and called attention in a most awkward and public manner to the close business connections between himself , Miss Morrow 's father and the United States government . " <P> Ship-news Men . In addition to the fact that Miss Morrow was apparently not offended by the reporters , there remains the fact that these reporters are among the best in New York . The ship-news assignment is coveted in Manhattan shops . The men who get it can , if any ever could , tie up their togas with blue ribbon . <P> It does happen on occasion that they will run a passenger ragged around the deck . One excitable prima donna one day heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " Came a voice : " It is I. " Thoughtlessly she opened the door . In poured the reporters and cameramen from whom she was hiding .
