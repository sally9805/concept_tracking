IN dealing with this topic , I wish to eschew all rhetoric and adopt a severely scientific attitude . Any man who is not a fiend or a maniac must by now be convinced that human life can not remain tolerable unless ways are found of preventing war on a large scale . It is true that war has existed for many thousands of years without preventing progress in civilization . But modern organization and machinery have made war a far more destructive thing than it ever was before , and have made its prevention far more imperative . If we are to discover ways of preventing it , we must be as scientific as a physiologist investigating the cause of cancer . There is , to my mind , a great deal of very unscientific thought in the world on the subject of the causes of war . All such thought turns good desires into channels where they can not prove effective . Only the combination of good desires with scientific insight can give success in pursuing this purpose of the prevention of war , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this preliminary , I shall address myself to the impartial analysis of the causes of war . Various unduly simple theories must first be dismissed . Many socialists contend that modern war is due tot capitalism , and would automatically disappear if capitalism were abolished.i The first and obvious objection to this theory is that war existed before capitalism . Modern wars are not so en-i tirely remote from ancient wars as to make it certain that their causes are utterly different . Nor do we find that the most capitalistic nations are the most warlike ; in fact , America is the least warlike of the great powers , while France , the most warlike , is the least industrial . The little countries of southeastern Europe are intensely bellicose , but mainly agricultural . Czarist Russia was by no means pa- cific , though eighty-five per cent . of the population were peasants . We find , of course , that capitalism , like every other powerful political force , becomes connected with the forces making for war wherever such forces exist ; but it is a wrong analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection that does exist is a matter to which I shall return presently . The friends of war have another theory , also unduly simple ; they say that war is due to " human nature . " The object of this theory is to recommend the conclusion that war can never be eradicated . But " human nature " is a very vague phrase . Presumably , it is intended to designate what is instinctive in us as opposed to what is learned from our social environment . The investigation of human instincts has been undertaken by a number of psychologists and anthropologists , but the best of them confess that as yet very little is known on the subject . One test of an instinct is that it must be found throughout the human race . Some very primitive races appear not to know war in our sense at all , but only combats between individuals ; this tends to prove'that war is not wholly instinctive . But , apart from this argument , there is the fact that the operation of an instinct depends not only upon human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every instinct in operation is a result of two factors , the predisposition and the stimulus . If you receive a blow on the nose , you will have an instinct to hit back ; but most of us never have the stimulus to the exercise of this instinct after we leave school . If you kept ten men without drink for a period of three days , and then put a single glass of water in front of them , they would fight for it , perhaps kill one another , and probably upset the water in the process . But it does not follow that at a dinner party each guest will fight to get all the food and drink for himself . So it is with war : given an adequate stimulus , war results from instinctive dispositions , but there is no reason why an adequate stimulus should be given . Many nations have lived without war for long periods , and have shown no sign that they were suffering from thwarted instinct . It may be admitted that energetic men love rivalry , and demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this impulse . The theory that war is due to human nature has two elements of truth : first , that our instinctive disposition responds to certain stimuli by an impulse to fight ; secondly , that some of our active impulses find satisfaction in war . But the stimuli can be removed by political measures , and the impulses can be satisfied by less destructive forms of contest . It is therefore not true that human nature makes war forever inevitable . ? 2 Another unduly simple theory is that war is due to the pressure of population . This theory is much in favor in Japan , it was advanced by some Germans before and during the war , and it is advocated occasionally by publicists infected with excessive Darwinism . The facts are conclusive against this theory . France has no population problem , but is extremely warlike . China has a population problem even more severe than that of Japan , yet shows no disposition to war . In the years immediately preceding the war ,  | Germany had no population problem , as may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little that occurred was mainly due to fear of military service . The theory of natural selection and the struggle for existence made people think that war must have biological causes . Such causes are seen operative in the victory of white men over the aborigines of America and Australia , a victory due more to bacilli than to firearms . But in the great wars between civilized countries biological considerations play a very small part . Sometimes , as in the British conquest of India , the effect is to increase the population of the vanquished and diminish that of the victors . This shows how dangerous it is to introduce biological ideas crudely in considering modern war . ? 3 To understand the causes of war , we must go to three sources : politics , economics , and social psychology . The last of these is unduly neglected in most discussions . Let us begin by trying to see what part it plays . Social psychology distinguishes two kinds of groups , the leaderless group , and the group that has a leader . In practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to either type ; that is to say , there are some decisions which spring from the decree of the leader , and others which he accepts from the desires or impulses of his followers . The power of a leader is greatest in a group organized for war ; indeed , it is probable that the needs of war were what originally caused the prevalence of leaders . Dr. Rivers tells how the Melanesians cooperate in complicated tasks without the need of leaders , just as a flock of birds in flight cooperates in wheeling to right or left all at the same moment . This instinct of leaderless cooperation is much stronger among savages than among civilized men , but even among savages it is not adequate for purposes of war . Accordingly , chiefs are adopted and obeyed in time of war . This is the origin of monarchical and aristocratic institutions . A community exposed to a constant risk of war retains its leaders even in time of peace , both for the sake of preparedness and because of the respect which they have won during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader becomes more and more predominant , culminating at last in absolute monarchy . This institution , however , is exposed to one or other of two difficulties . If it is hereditary , the vigorous man who founded the dynasty is likely to be succeeded by descendants who are greatly inferior to him ; they delegate their authority to subordinates , and come in time to be despised . If the monarchy is not hereditary , the death of the ruler is pretty sure to lead to an outbreak of civil war among rival claimants by which the state is weakened . Both causes may be seen operating in the decline of the Roman and Chinese empires . The modern world has found a solution in representative institutions , which lead to a peaceful method of choosing non-hereditary leaders . But the old psychology of the tribe on the war-path is still at the bottom of much of the relation between leader and followers . How this affects the question of war , I ' shall now try to show . First , the power of leaders is much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is greater when peace is threatened than when peace is secure .  | Leaders are sure to be people with a great love of power . If they are hereditary , they have always had the habit and expectation of power , which make the thought of a life without power intolerable . If they have been chosen , they must have had the energy to get themselves chosen , which almost invariably implies a great desire for a prominent position . Therefore in either case the leaders will be glad of anything that increases their authority . Nothing increases their authority so much as war , because of the instinctive make-up of men 's social instincts . Therefore leaders , other things being equal , have a constant temptation to lead their followers into war . I do not mean that all this is in their conscious thoughts . But the virtues they will naturally prize will be loyalty , obedience , and the like , and they will feel almost unconsciously that war brings these into play . What will emerge in consciousness may be a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but derived psychologically from the impulse to consolidate leadership . This applies especially to those leaders whose authority has a traditional basis and is threatened , rightly or wrongly , by modern movements . Emperors and ministers of religion belong to this class . In 1914 the kaiser and the czar both wanted war . The real reason was that the emotions of war rouse the primitive devotion of the tribe to its chief , and sweep aside the more artificial forms of social cooperation which democracy has built up in modern times . It is true that the kaiser and the czar both lost their thrones because they were defeated ; but both , of course , expected to win , and would have consolidated their authority if they had done so . Ministers of religion of all denominations were , with few exceptions , enthusiastic for the war . At first sight this seems curious . Shortly after Confucius , there was a Chinese philosopher , Mo Tih , who preached the doctrine of non-resistance . His teachings were widely accepted , and those who accepted them refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and were suppressed . The Chinese are puzzled by the fact that the same doctrine is part of the religion of the white nations , and yet the official teachers of this religion are , as a rule , more bellicose even than the average man . Why is this ? Evidently because the fear which exists in war-time increases the authority of religious leaders , and therefore seems to them to be making people more virtuous , though , like the emperors , they are unconscious of this motive . ? 4 So far we have been considering only the leader 's side of the social psychology of war . It is time to turn to the other side . Men will not follow a leader unless his commands are in some conformity with their own desires and impulses . Unless war made some appeal to the disposition of the average man , he would simply set aside a leader who invited him to go to war , whereas we find that , in the first days of a war , the leaders who have brought it on are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the closely related motives of fear and rage . The war , of course , has been brought on by the other side , therefore we may justly feel angry with them ; and the more reason there is to fear the harm they may do , the more occasion there is for anger . This attitude , how- ever , is not wholly genuine . At the outbreak of war people do not examine dispassionately the case for and against their own side ; they seize with avidity on the propaganda which is offered to them , and if they are deceived , the fault lies largely with themselves . We can not therefore place all the blame on leaders , however much they may misrepresent the facts . Fear , rivalry , love of dominion , and love of excitement are the chief emotions which make the ordinary man not averse from war . The part played by fear is a little complicated : when fear goes beyond a certain point , it prevents war , but when it falls below this point , it promotes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is quite obvious that they must be beaten . But when the chances are fairly evenly balanced , fear produces hatred and a state of nerves and the expectation of being attacked by the other side . This is a mood in which any little incident may lead to war fever . Thus fear is a motive which reinforces rivalry , though where the disparity of strength is so great that rivalry is out of the question , fear produces submission . Love of dominion produces imperial wars ? the South-African War , , the Spanish-American War , and so on . This motive does not operate only with rulers . The ordinary citizen likes to feel that his country is putting forth its might and showing dirty Dagoes or wily Chinks or whoever it may be that they can not flout an imperial race with impunity . This sentiment is very well developed in Great Britain ; in the United States it is still in its infancy , but no doubt it will grow . The part played by love of excitement in leading to the outbreak of wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read newspapers more , this motive becomes increasingly powerful . The passions which promote war clothe themselves in myths , which are accepted by almost the whole of a belligerent nation . These myths , like the delusions of psychoanalytic patients , completely deceive men 's consciousness , and are thought to be the grounds of their actions , whereas they are really excuses covering up less reputable motives . Since , unfortunately , the medical men in the community mostly share the collective hysteria , there is no one to psychoanalyze the patients , and they encourage one another , like a lunatic asylum suddenly bereft of keepers . When the fit is over , they quite forget what they said and thought during their excitement . I invite anybody to look up the newspapers of the first days of a war which he thinks he remembers ; he will be amazed at the hot blast of unreason that meets him , and will find it incredible that he read the newspapers at the time without any feeling of revulsion . Most people in England have quite forgotten that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belgian children with their hands cut off , who were believed in although not one had a name and address . I fancy Mr. H. G. Wells has quite forgotten that he coined the phrase about a " War to end war , " that he professed himself " enthusiastic for this war against Prussian militarism , " and that when the Germans were before Liege he pronounced the German military machine powerless to advance another step . It is well to remember these things , so as to be on our guard next time . I pass now to those causes of war which are not wholly irrational , but are based upon some person 's expectation  | of profit to himself or his country or his cause . Wars are caused , as a rule , by a small number of people , on more or less rational grounds , desiring them , and operating upon the irrational impulses of the crowd by appeals to honor , patriotism , etc . It is necessary to understand both sides of the process . They may be compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacillus and the predisposition . Probably we are all exposed almost daily ? those , at least , who live in cities  - -  to infection by the tubercle bacillus , but only those who are more or less predisposed actually acquire the disease . So we are constantly exposed to war-mongers , but we do not become warlike without a certain predisposition . I want now to consider the warmongers , who provide the stimulus to war-fever . Just as a disease may be treated either by an antitoxin or by hygiene , so war-fever may be treated either by sterilizing the war-mongers or by rendering the population too sane to be infected by them . Both methods are good , and both should be pursued simultaneously . But first let us see what are the war-monger 's motives . ? 5 - First of all , there are genuine wars of principle ; civil wars are often of this kind . The English Civil War and the American Civil War were both wars of principle . In the latter , for example , the war-mongers were the convinced abolitionists and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government fought and won against half Russia and the whole outside world was a war of principle , as to whether the world should be organized on the basis of production for use or production for profit . Because it was a war of principle , the Bolsheviks were able to win it by propaganda , because the other side could secure soldiers only by concealing its principles . The war-mongers in that war were the convinced communists and the convinced supporters of capitalism . These two are also the men who are preparing the great Marxian class-war , probably in the form of a revolt of debtor nations against the tyranny of creditor nations . In all such cases , it is the men who hold strong political convictions who are the war-mongers . Wars of prestige are an important class ; in these the war-mongers are partly men who will be admired if the war is won , and partly men with a very strong national consciousness . Such men are by no means always self-interested . Hardly any person did more to bring on the Great War than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Year in , year out , he preached suspicion of Germany ; he raked up every fact that could be used against the Germans , and softened every fact that could be used against the Russians . He provided politicians with telling arguments about the danger of German competition , and poltroons with bogies about the German navy . But all this was done quite disinterestedly , because he believed it his patriotic duty to do it . He had no personal ax to grind . No doubt his subconscious motive was pride in his own country 's power , and the wish to see the supremacy of Great Britain restablished . Purely sentimental motives of this kind play a quite enormous part in the genesis of war . Politicians become war-mongers from less worthy motives . To rouse national passion is a good way of caus- ing one 's past sins to be overlooked . A politician goes to the average voter and says , " Vote for me , and I will make you rich and prosperous . " The average voter votes , but does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politician . But the politician persuades him that it is the wicked foreigner who is to blame . He exhorts the average voter nobly to forget his own selfish needs , and to devote himself to the unselfish task of exterminating the wicked foreigner . If the average man has no recent experience of war , he responds enthusiastically , and the politician gets a new lease of power . There are only two cures for this state of affairs : one , more sense on the part of the average voter ; the other , a law that every politician who advocates a war shall spend the whole duration of the war in the trenches , unless he meets his deserts before the war is over . ? 6 I come now at last to what generally comes first ? the economic causes of war . As to these , let it be clearly understood what is meant . It is not the subsistence of the population that is concdrned ; no modern war is likely to enrich the ordinary citizen of the victorious party . What is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who identify themselves with various national sentiments , and thus secure the lives and fortunes of their gulls in support of their business enterprises . And the object which these groups of rich men aim at is not even money ; in almost all cases , the object is merely the defeat of a rival group . If money were the object , they would combine with their rivals . But they are rich enough to be indifferent to profits , and devote themselves instead to victory , which they secure by generating universal hatred , exterminating millions of men in battle , killing millions of children by starvation , and destroying civilizations wholesale . In the intervals of these beneficent activities , they address Y. M. C. A. 's on the duties of a true Christian . And their piety is applauded by their hirelings in universities and churches throughout the length and breadth of the land . The fact that business , with certain exceptions , is organized ' nationally rather than internationally is due to two causes : first , that big business enjoys rivalry , without which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nationality enables a national business to get the assistance of armies and navies gratis . There is no technical reason why businesses of the sort that are now national trusts should not be international trusts ; if this were the case , the business men would be richer , and the rest of the world would be delivered from a great menace . But before that becomes possible on a large scale , we shall all have to grow less nationalistic in our sentiments . Assuming the national organization of big business , the economic causes of modern war follow inevitably . Two things are involved , markets and raw materials . Either may be secured by annexing territory , but may also be secured in less blatant ways . I shall not say anything about markets , as this is a well worn theme , but a few words about raw materials are unavoidable . Raw materials may be needed for peaceful industry or for war munitions . Let us begin with the former . The United States is in a singularly fortunate position in this respect ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw materials which have to be mainly obtained from abroad . Great Britain , on the contrary , is in a singularly unfortunate position . Originally , coal and iron gave supremacy to British industry , but now the iron ore is nearly exhausted , so that the British iron and steel industry depends upon ore from Spain and Sweden . With the exception of coal , virtually all the raw materials of British industry come from abroad . As nations become aware of the importance of raw materials , they become less willing to export them , and more anxious to utilize them at home . Great Britain , therefore , can not count on the necessary supplies of raw materials except from regions under her political control , direct or indirect . That is one reason why loss of empire would mean the death by starvation of about half the population of Great Britain . In these circumstances a certain degree of imperialism is scarcely surprising . The raw materials of war raise even graver problems . Success in modern war depends almost wholly upon five factors : coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Credit , perhaps , is hardly an independent item , since a nation which possesses the other four requisites will also be able to get credit . Coal and oil are more or less alternatives ; a nation which has one can use it for many purposes for which another nation might use the other . But oil is indispensable for some purposes , whereas coal can almost always be replaced by oil , so that oil is the more important . We may therefore reduce our list to oil , iron , and industrial skill . Russia lacked industrial skill , and Germany lacked oil ; that is why both were defeated in the Great War . But industrial skill can be created , whereas oil and iron can not . Therefore as motives for imperialism oil and iron are the prime factors . France acquired the iron of Lorraine by the Versailles Treaty , but needed Ruhr coke in order to work it profitably . That is why France is in the Ruhr and German learned men are dying of hunger and cold . Japan needed coal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain control of the coal and iron in China . The Washington Conference did almost nothing to liberate the Chinese from this yoke . The oil of the world is controlled by two rival groups , an American and an Anglo-Dutch group , but politically it may be taken as British . The American oil interests have an understanding with the French Government , whereby they have practical control of any oil in French hands . Hence they have supported all that France has done against Germany in recent years ; at Genoa , it was apparently these interests that prevented the adoption of a sane and united policy . They embolden the French to resist British demands for moderation , and makes the British not dare to press these demands for fear of displeasing America . Meanwhile British oil interests have dominated British policy for many years past . The British Government agreed with Czarist Russia to partition Persia just when that country had inaugurated a democratic and progressive government . The British took the south , where most of the oil is , and have held on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British have established themselves in Mesopotamia and Mosul , exterminating political opponents in that region by bombs from aeroplanes . For the sake of the Borneo oil , the  | British are creating a great naval base at Singapore , and trying to force the Dutch to create an East-Indian navy . Since the oil belongs to British and Dutch jointly , such a navy , if it existed , could be counted on to cooperate with the British , supporting itself on Singapore . In this way , the provisions of the Washington Treaty would be evaded without being infringed . It is said by propagandists of American oil interests that the oil in the United States will be nearly exhausted in another twenty years , whereas the oil controlled by the British is capable of lasting another two hundred years . Since naval supremacy depends on oil , and the life of half the population of the British Isles depends on naval supremacy , the question is one which interests British statesmen . They therefore put the British Army and Navy at the disposal of the British oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends of millionaires . It is said that British and American oil interests have come to an agreement . I very much hope that this is true , since the question is just of the kind to lead to a firstclass war . It must not be supposed that there is any right or wrong in the question ; so long as nationalism and private capitalism persist , no attempt to settle the question on a basis of justice is possible . ? 7 Competition between nations for markets and raw materials can be avoided by two methods . The easy method , which may be adopted any day , is an agreement among powerful groups , parceling out the world , and recognizing one another 's exclusive claims . This would do a great deal of good , or , rather , would prevent a great deal of harm . It would replace national capitalism by international capitalism , and therefore remove the present economic causes of war . But it would increase rather than diminish the exploitation of the weak by the strong . America and Great Britain could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by the old crude method of annexing territory , but by giving or withholding credit , raw materials , and commodities . They would of course use their power tyrannically . France , Italy , and Germany would perhaps be admitted to partnership , but Russia , India , and China would sooner or later rebel . United , they could achieve independence , since they are mainly agricultural and contain about half the human race . Probably they would develop an economic system different from ours , and would therefore be said to practise the nationalization of women . Ultimately , the proletariats of Western countries would wish to adopt their economic system . In this way , therefore , no permanent peace is to be expected . There is another , more difficult , method of dealing with competition between nations . Under the stress of war , this method was actually adopted as between the Allies . This method is to have an international authority for each kind of commodity or raw material of fundamental importance , which decides how much each country is to have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population . During the war there was a petroleum commission , an iron and steel commission , a coal commission , and so on , each containing representatives from the various nations concerned . These commissions decided  | how the available supplies should be divided among the Allied nations . The same system , extended to all nations in time of peace , would solve the whole problem of raw materials . But of course the stronger nations , especially America and Great Britain , will never voluntarily surrender the advantages of their strength in this way , at any rate until the opposition to them is strong enough to frighten them . And this will not be until industrial development has made great strides in Russia , India , and China . Thus we are brought back to the same position as before . I do not wish to suggest , however , that the position is hopeless . The trouble springs from the interlocking of two evils . On the one hand , mankind have a proneness to group-feeling , that is , to the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other would be to its advantage . The disposition to form herds is , in a loose sense , instinctive , but their rivalry need not take the form of war , and is capable of taking forms that are beneficent when a superior authority makes war impossible . Unfortunately , the national herds are utilized by ruthless and bloodthirsty business interests in their contests ; this is praised under the name of competition . If the existing system of production for profit were superseded , at least as regards fundamental raw materials , by a system of production for use , there would no longer be so much money spent on bribing newspapers , schoolmasters , professors , and parsons to ex- tol bloodshed under the name of patriotism . In that case , public opinion might be changed by the operation of reason . It might come to be understood that patriotism is the blackest crime of which a man in our age can be guilty . A man who murders one man with his own hands is executed by the law , but a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is universally respected and has statues put up to him when he dies . Those of us who do not wish to see our whole civilization go down in red ruin have a great and difficult duty to perform ? to guard the door of our minds against patriotism . I mean , that we should view impartially any dispute between our own country and another , that we should teach ourselves not to believe our own country morally superior to others , and that even in time of war we should view the whole matter as a neutral might view it . This is part of the larger duty of pursuing truth ; nationalism can not survive without false beliefs . If we can learn to serve truth , to be truthful in our thoughts , to avoid the flattering myths in which we like to disguise our passions , we shall have done what we can to save our world from disaster . For this creed it is worth while to suffer , and indeed those who have it must suffer , for persecution is as bitter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very suffering there is happiness , and a promise of better things in the time to come .  |
