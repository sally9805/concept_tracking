" Every motor car would be headed for the scrapheap ; every loudspeaker would be silent ; every telephone would ' go dead ' ; every electric light would go out . The gloveless surgeon would be unable to perform his life-saving operations . . . . Contemporary man could not get along . . . . Life would be devoid of half its conveniences and comforts . . . . " <P> Such was the alarming prophecy , last week , of able Dr. Julius Klein of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce . He was recalling the ancient and modern history of the commodity of rubber . Columbus , exploring the island of Hispaniola , was the first to see natives playing with balls which seemed to bound miraculously to Heaven . Three centuries later , Chemist Joseph Priestley advised his fellow Englishmen that the miraculous substance would erase pencil-markings , might well be called " rubber . " It was only 100 years ago that a Scotchman named Mackintosh dissolved rubber in naptha and perpetuated his name in an overcoat . And in 1839 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on a hot stove and witnessed the first , accidental process of vulcanization . <P> Scholarly Dr. Klein knew that in 1926 , rubber led the list of U. S. imports , that 1927 imports were valued at $340,000,000 . In vivid , effective phrases , he pictured civilization " suddenly and permanently " deprived of rubber . <P> Point was undeniably given Dr. Klein 's prophecies by the occasion which prompted them . He spoke on the eve of the most important day the rubber industry has seen in six years . Fortunately , the day gave happy instead of dismal point to Dr. Klein 's vision of a rubberless world . For on Nov. 1 , the six-year British experiment in restricting export of rubber from Malaya came to an abrupt and official end . <P> British historians , writing of the great post-War recovery , acclaiming the return to the gold standard and the rebuilding of the merchant marine , will deal briefly and reluctantly with the effort to control the rubber markets of the world . The experiment which began Nov. 1 , 1922 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hundreds of fortunes were drawn into the maelstrom of its collapse . <P> In conception , the plan appeared both simple and practical . Of the world 's rubber supply , Great Britain in 1922 controlled about 67% . British plantations in the East , principally in Malaya , produced in that year 300,000 tons . Dutch plantations , in Java and the East Indies , produced only 95,000 tons . Prices were low . In an attempt to boost prices , establish a monopoly , Great Britain undertook , by the Stevenson Restriction Act , to regulate exports from Malaya . The idea was to fix the price of crude rubber at between 30 and 40 a pound . <P> For a time , the restriction was brilliantly successful . Prices soared far above 40. , reached a high in 1925 of $1.21 a pound and in that year averaged 73 U. S. rubber users , tiremakers , were in a public panic . They pressed a campaign of conservation . They began to " reclaim " used rubber . They started a world-wide search for plantations where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Alva Edison to study how to extract rubber from such plants as milkweed . And , in 1926 , tiremakers formed the Rubber Pool to buy a great supply at between 35 and 41 a pound .
