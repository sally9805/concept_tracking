 | Elizabethian America I WE know a land of Elizabethan ways ? a country of Spenserian speech , Shakespearean people , and of cavaliers and curtsies . It is a land of high hopes and mystic allegiances , where one may stroll through forests of Arden and find heaths and habits like those of olden England . We are speaking of the Southern highlands ? Appalachia and Ozarkadia . Putting it generally , Appalachia includes the four western counties of Maryland , the Blue Ridge hills , the Allegheny Ridge country of Virginia , Eastern Kentucky , Eastern Tennessee , Western North Carolina , Northwestern South Carolina , Northern Georgia , and Northeastern Alabama ? an area of about a hundred and twelve thousand square miles , approximately that of New York and New England combined , or of England , Ireland , Scotland , and Wales put into one . And by way of an appendage there are the Ozark hills of Southern Missouri , Northwestern Arkansas , and the southeastern tip of Oklahoma , a country in dimensions near a hundred and fifty by two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York State . The people of Appalachia generally call themselves mountain folks ; those of the Ozarks , hill people . The Southern highlands have between six and seven million people , which is somewhere about the population of England during the days of Shakespeare . Nearly 86 per cent of the Southern highlanders are rural 238 people , which is approximately the ratio which held in Elizabethan England . Husbandmen and ploughmen of Shakespeare 's England and present-day upland farmers could very likely have rubbed shoulders and swapped yarns with few misunderstandings , lingual or otherwise ; for Elizabethan English , as well as Elizabethan England , appears to have survived magnificently in these isolated Southern uplands . The speech of the Southern mountains is a survival of the language of older days , rather than a degradation of United States English or a falling away from blunt-edged journalese . Mountain speech has little slang or sauciness . While it does , of course , show local differences a plenty , a surprisingly large number of old words have survived , along with a surprisingly large number of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . Illustrations are plentiful enough . The most casual of listeners will become conscious of the preponderance of strong preterits in mountain speech : clum ' for climbed , ' drug ' for dragged , " wrapped ' for wrapped , ' fotch ' for fetched , ' and hole ' for helped ' ? all sound Elizabethanisms , to be found in Shakespeare , Lovelace , or King James 's Bible . The Southern uplander says fur ' ( for ) with Sir Philip Sidney , furder ' with Lord Bacon and in common with Hakluyt , allow ' for suppose . ' Like Chaucer , he forms the plurals of monosyllables ending in. ' st ' by adding es ' ? pontes , ' r  | @# beastes , " jystes ' ( joists ) , nestes , ' and ghostes . ' Shakespeareanlike , he probably calls a salad a sallet , ' a bag a poke , ' says antic ' for careful , ' and bobble ' for mix-up . ' Like Piers Plowman , he says heaps of people , ' and Spenserlike says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit , ' and says swinge ' for singe . ' He keeps such Elizabethan pronunciations as sence , " ag'in ' , " scriptur , " ventur , " natur , " yit , ' and yander . ' He still toles ' hogs with corn , and , like Gower , comments upon a sighte of feynold flowers . ' He gets up afore daylight ' to make a soon start , ' rives ' oak blocks into shingle boards , carries a budget ' on his back , looks out for quiled-up ' snakes , and on particular occasions uses a handerker . ' Theseus , in A Midsummer-Night 's Dream , commends the pert and nimble spirit of mirth . ' Ephraim Kilgew may reasonably testify that he is raising up a pert bunch of'young ' uns . Like Othello , the hiliman spends ' his opinions . He most likely says dorts ' for sulks , ' dauncy ' for ailing , ' chat ' for gravel , ' swarve ' for crowd together , ' and tinsey ' for tiny . ' Southern uplanders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of an occasion , to express thoughts which are still mobile . Elizabethanlike , their speech is still rollicsome and fluid . The mill war consider'ble damnified . ' Can I get over that road ? ' Well , I do n't jest edzactly know . Some places the rain has gouted it out mightily . You ' 11 have to surround them places . ' I done been and had dinner . ' Sheep is natured like deer . ' ' B'ar is destructious . They kill hawgs . ' Hit 'll take two slugs er buckshot to moralize Forgy Dell . ' I ai n't saw Tom in forty year . I ca n't hardly memorize him . ' If it do n't disfurnish ye none , I 'll pay fur that ham-meat later on . ' Comparatives and superlatives are generally formed by adding a final er ' or est , ' regardless of the length of the word : endurabler , " fast-runnin'er , ' fiddlin'est , ' preachin'est , ' and hogkillin'est . ' Just as wealth ' is a collective of weal , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steals , spilth ' is what one spills , and a blowth ' is a mass of blowing things or blossoms . They take the y from yeast , ' but add it to earn ' ; queer ' is usually quare ' ; care , " keer ' ; chair , ' cheer ' ; crop , ' crap . ' Extra is frequently invade such words as ' wafter , ' orter , ' after , ' and even make a way into names , such as Caurdle ' and Orsborne . ' The Chaucerian hit ' is frequently substituted for it , ' but by no means invariably . The choice seems to be governed by an instinct for euphony . Like Spenser , they say swarve ' for swerve , ' and , like the immaculate Alexander Pope , jine ' for join . ' Elizabethan exactness of thinking is easily discernible in upland speech . They talk of cow-brutes , ham-meat , lard-cracklin 's , of tooth-dent , churchhouses , biscuit-bread , and rifle-guns . Was the new baby at your house a boy ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit 's a boy yit . ' Does that jug hold a gallon ? ' W'y , no , not hardly . But hit 'll hold quite a content . ' I 'm clearn'n ' a field to raise my bread . ' II Broadly speaking , the Southern highlanders are an Old England folk , English and Scotch-Irish , whose forebears came forth from Elizabethan England , a nation of young life which had just  | found its prime , a nation of energy and daring , a nation leaping from childhood into manhood . And the spirit of Elizabethan England has long survived the weathering of time . The first settlers brought with them Elizabethan ways of living , and these ways have lasted in a country of magnificent isolation , one little touched by the ways of a modern world . Southern uplanders do not have the Elizabethan 's wealth , galleries , or his mechanics and autocracies of high living . They are rather the counterparts of rural Elizabethans , folk of plain and splendid ways . ' All the corn we make our bread of groweth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all of our own breeding . Our garments , also , or much thereof , are made in our own home . Our own malt and water maketh our drink . ' Thus went a good husbandman 's boast of self-sufficiency . It goes in much the same way with the Southern uplander . He gambles squarely upon the benevolence of soil , growth , and weather . He plants crops , hunts game , catches fish , and harvests fruits and berries with a basic idea of self-sufficiency . His wife cooks , churns , makes the clothes , keeps the home , and picks the geese for feather beds . Coffee , baking soda , kerosene , sugar , and lamp chimneys are virtually the only commodities to be bought at the village store . And if times are hard he can use maple or molasses sweetening , make parched-wheat coffee , and sit about in the firelight ; or , more expedient still , go to bed at dusk . He cuts elm and ash for cart parts and ploughs , hickory for axe handles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidence ' in the days of fair Bess . Countrysides have their midwives , their herb doctors , their basket makers , their carders , and their millers . Water mills still turn which have ground their community 's grain for fully a century . and farm boys continue to ride toward them , with bags of shelled corn swung over their horses ' withers ? shirts open , lips pursed for whistling , bodies asway to the leisurely , plodding gaits of their mounts . Trevesses 's Good Plowmen , as a polaris for rural life in Old England , has this to say of the country fare : ? Look weekly of custom and right For roast meat on Sundays and Thursdays at night . But the rest of the week pease and bacon washed down by a draft of cider or good homebrew ale , made the husbandman 's ordinary dinner . To the haymaking field he and his workers took with them a bottle or two of good beer , with an apple pasty , potted butter , churn-milk bread and cheese . The well-to-do ate wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rye or barley , and in time of dearth , beans , pease and oats . The culinary outlay of a modernday uplander offers a pretty consistent parallel . Sunday calls for meat , pork or beef roast , chicken , squirrel , or fried wild turkey or fish or rabbit . The settler will probably have a meat dinner or two during the course of the week . But the Elizabethan countryman 's stand-bys of pease and bacon hold general following among mountain people ; pole beans or bunch beans , picked green in season and shined ' and kilned for winter use ; corn-meal breads , with flour breads the occasional luxury ; and pork meat , bacon , jowls , sausage , ham-meat , backbone , spareribs , and shoulder joints , boiled , fried , stewed , or baked ? those are the hillman 's day-in and day-out dependables . Except in the pasture , country beef is generally scarce . Hogs represent the easiest source of meat . The standing motto regarding pigs is to raise plenty and eat plenty . Mongrel sows are astonishingly prolific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth from eating herbs and acorns , and have only to be ' : , gypped off ' with corn at slaughtering time . Frequently a hill family will daughter twenty or thirty shoats for a season 's meat . We know a patriarch in the vicinity of Hawg Eye , Arkansas , who regularly slaughters twelve pigs for the nurture of each of his twelve offspring ? a hundred and forty-four a year . Now , since four of his daughters and three of his sons are married and moved farther on up the creek a way , the benevolent old squire can hardly reckon how he is going to range enough hogs to provide for the coming harvest of grandchildren . Nicholas Vreton tells of rural England of old : ? August brought the harvest and the end of the husbandman 's year , a merry time wherein honest neighbors make good cheer . The sun dries up the standing ponds . Now begin the gleaners to follow the corn cart , and a little bread to a great deal of drink makes the traveller 's dinner ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil and the vinegar give attendance to the sallet herb . The pipe and the tabor is now lustily set on work , and the lad and the lass will have no lead in their heels . The new wheat makes the gossip cake and the bride cup is carried above the head of the whole parish . The fermenty pot welcomes home the harvest cart and the garland of flowers crowns the captain of the reapers . Then come the brisking nights of autumn with new revelry . The young folks , smiling , kiss at every turn in the dance ; the old folk sit about talking and laughing ; the children dance for a garland or play at stoolball for a tansey and a banquest of curds and cream . There is much drinking of old nappy ale and casting of sheep eyes , much exchanging between men and maidens of pairs of gloves or pretty handerkers . In Elizabethan America , October brings the corn harvest and the end of the tenant 's year . But the tilling season is pretty thoroughly over by late duly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as the yield of wheat barley and buckwheat continues generally decreasing . Corn huskings and county fairs offer the uplanders their autumnal daytime diversion . Then comes the regular run of the season 's merrymakings ? hay rides , fish giggings , possum hunts , candy pullings , and quiltings . And if you should chance to be roaming about in the vicinity of a back-hill meetinghouse on a Saturday night , it is altogether probable that you will first hear a vague , far-off pounding noise , and on coming nearer you will gradually come to identify the squeak of a fiddle . Inside you will see gyratory merriment ? big and little , young and old , executing square dances , flings , and reels , sedate and otherwise ; virtually everyone in the frolic , whole-heartedly , from toe to top hair . And then there are the moonlight picnics and pie suppers , where frolic holds sway and foodstuffs are consumed in splendid profusion . III As a people the Southern highlanders are surprisingly free from awkwardness and uncouthness . Theirs is an unpresuming dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etiquette and politeness . Theirs is a genuine , unhurried serenity . They are a folk who can afford old-time , homely ambitions . The other day we were asking about an upcountry acquaintance . Do I know Uncle Bog Sellers ? Why , this creek were named fur him . He been right puny this winter , but he 's perter now . You see , he 'd killed ninetynine b'ar in his lifetime , and war fixin ' fur another hunt when he tuck sick with a misery in the stummick . The doctor told him he 'd got to die . But fully a century , - ue to ride toof shelled corn rses ' withers ? i for whistling , ti urely , plodding @#  | Uncle Bog , he prayed the good Lord to raise him up to kill jest one more b'ar ? and , shore ' nough , He done it . ' We know another upcountryman in Taney County , Missouri . His name is Elijah Shrum . In his young days Lige was commonly taken as being worthless , merely because he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bull-tongue plough . So Lige took up treasure hunting as a life 's occupation . He spent better than forty years at searching for bountiful treasure . He followed down marker trails , prowled through the backmost recesses of innumerable caves , digging and delving , following out generally the path of high romance . Mr. Shrum has not , at this writing , unearthed the manifold treasure , but he still figures to find it ? to unearth , one of these days , an iron-bound chest altogether too heavy for one man to hoist . So he continues high-heartedly at the search , and the years have in no way dimmed his ardor . We know another searcher after stars , a dwarf named Sammy Blankhall . For twenty-odd years he ran a store near Eagle Rock , and did well enough , too , until one night his store burned to the ground , leaving him not only penniless , but heavily in debt . We took a tramp together the other day . He showed me into the one-room log cabin which he calls home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with bushels and bushels of hulled black walnuts . Sammy explained that he is n't stout enough to swing an axe , nor has he the heft to follow a plough , and so he is paying off his debt to the wholesale grocery house by picking out walnut kernels and selling them to town confectioners . Sammy is sixtyfour . By the time he is seventy he reckons he will have paid out the whole of his indebtedness . The uplander 's vital philosophy resembles that of the Elizabethan 's in that it is usually more proverbial than speculative . Both were doubtless prone to agree with Launcelot Gobbo that it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i ' the morning . ' Lore of spells and magic , strange fantasies of moon destinies , ill omens and bringers of wealth and fertility , still hold sway in the Southern back hills . When ordinary means fail , the hillman is an edge more likely to consult a witch doctor than to call a skilled veterinarian when the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Here is a somewhat typical story of magic coming from the Cumberland country . Old Doc was a-walkin ' along with his wife . They was both elderly , and she says , " Let 's go up to this house and git a light for our pipes . " Folks did n't have matches none to speak'n of in them days ; many a time I 've walked a mile to a neighbor 's with a shovel to borry fire . Well , they found a child that screamin ' an ' kickin ' ? bewitched . So Doc told ' em to git him nine new pins that had n't never been stuck in cloth , an ' a bottle . He putts the pins in the bottle and sets it on the mantelshelf . Then he got a shingle and drawed a picture of a woman and told the man to set it up ag'in ' a stump and shoot it jest at sundown . About a week atter that , Doc was comin ' by ag'in , an ' he inquired atter the child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him an old woman across the holler had died with a shriek everwhen the man shot the picture with his rifle-gun . And the bottle on the mantelpiece busted into a thousand pieces , and they never did find ary one of them pins . ' Just as the Elizabethan countryman took the blood of an elephant mingled  | with the ashes of a weasel as a cure for leprosy and dead moles as a cure for baldness , believed in love charms and the avenging power of a wax figure pierced through with a needle and put to melt before the fire , so the Southern mountaineer will drive a spike through the heart of a tree to make it fruitful , or devise tonics or healing potions from cobwebs or iron rust . Some of them will tell you that the moon and stars are eternal lamps set out to show the signs and the seasons , and that the lay of the Milky Way predicts the direction of the prevailing winds for a period of a lunar month . The set of the horns of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oak leaves and the habits of fireflies they take as ready barometers . When cattle munch restlessly at pasture , or barn owls whoop in the daytime , or snake trails show in the dust , they begin making ready to stack the hay or tote in the fodder , for the signs say rain . In the wintertime , if the household Tabitha sits with her tail toward the fire , or if the wind whistles through the orchard land , they figure to fetch in a few extra armloads of firewood ? cold weather is coming . Grain crops , beans , and vegetables they plant during the light of the moon , because these are sunlight crops , but they plant potatoes in the dark of the moon , since potatoes are tubers , growing in underground darkness . They take medicine and cures under a waning moon , so that their ills may also wane . Very generally they split rails , chop post timber , rive boards , and slaughter hogs when ' Ma Moon ' is appropriately set . They witch ' for water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are treasure finders who witch for buried gold and silver by slipping a silver dime or a piece of gold into the fork of their twig . So their folkish ways go . As a race they place inestimably more confidence in elves than in elevators . IV When it comes to folk romancers and romantic rascals , the Southern highlands again smack of Merry England . Not too specifically speaking , the moonshiners are the upcountry Robin Hoods . They have their Friar Tucks , their Maid Marians , their Little Johns , their Greenwood revels , and their Sheriffs . They hold Saturday night gambles and gambols in palatial chambers of mountain caves . The run of moonshiners are , pro .. fessionally speaking , a cave people , but their homes are the open hills . It is true , too , that some of the young radicals make their runs in the open brush , trusting their fortunes to isolation , legal degression , ready defense , and a fast get-away . But the oldtimers continue to labor underground and to jubilate in the open wildwood or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonshiner is closely akin to that of the forest poacher in the days of Queen Bess . Moonshining began merely as a household economy . The first settlers lacked means and utensils for canning or evaporating their surplus of fruit and produce . Their potatoes , parsnips , and turnips could be holed up ' in the field for winter use ; cabbage they put to kraut , meat was salted and smoked ; but for saving their surplus of fruits and berries they trusted to alcoholic preservation . They made brandies of their cherries , peaches , blackberries , and pawpaws ; they made alcoholic preserves of their plums and apples , made sweet rum ' from their sorghum seconds , ' and put their surplus of corn , rye , and barley to the making of paralyzing stimulants . The world grew up about them , ' along with elderly , and to this house pipes . " Folks to speak'n a time I 've is with a they found ' kickin ' ? Doc was atter anybody him an had died shot And the into did  | leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were few and farscattered . They are yet . Back-hill travel routes usually follow the stream beds , and this involves sundry fordings and blockades . Commodities bulky as grain , or perishable as fruit or eggs or butter , were next to impossible to market . And a hillman needs a little cash money now and then , even as you and I. A gallon of corn in the keg may fetch more cash than an acre of corn in the ear . Just as the poachers of olden England slew the Queen 's deer and made ready to take the consequences , so the blockaders ' of Elizabethan America crush their corn , set their beers , ' make their runs , keg their wares , swig their surplus , and let go roll ? life , and a dollar for the fiddler 's toll . ' Moonshiners have no time for mincing or bickering about professional casualties . Should one be killed or lamed by an enforcement officer ? well , that is all in the day 's labor . And if it appears expedient to plug a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to shove one over a high wild bluff with only moonlight , mountain air , and limestone ledges below , then that , too , is part of the game of swap . But the chances are that the moonshiner will pay his debts , give milk and meal to the widow lady , prove helpful at births and buryings , and , once convinced of your harmlessness , take you into his home with a hospitality which is nothing short of princely . So moonshining has come to be a hardy trade . Liquor is hard to make by the hill-country recipe . Corn must be shucked and shelled and cracked in tub mills or with hickory mauls or pestles . The distilling must be done in a creek bed or beside an underground stream , for running water offers the only means of refrigeration . If vaporization is too slow or too fast , then all is not well with the product . To make a first run requires from thirtysix to forty-eight hours of firing , which means that the moonshiner must be on his toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . And there are the hazards and hardships and luckless slips . While the moonshiner draws out his thread of romance , he can not forget that its spool is tethered to handcuffs , jail houses , penitentiaries , and buryin ' grounds . His candle is lit at both ends , and it burns with a clear blue flame .
