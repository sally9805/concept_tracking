A take it or leave it offer-and a surprisingly generous one-was made to Germany by the Allies last week , according to the press bureau of the German delegation to the second Dawes Committee in Paris ( TIME , Jan 14 et seq . ) . Whereas under the Dawes Plan the Reich is scheduled to pay in reparations $595,000,000 yearly , the Germans said they had been offered a cut to $420,000,000 . <P> Hitherto Germany 's representative-her famed " Iron Man , " Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , president of the Reichsbank-had hung doggedly to $332,000,000 as the greatest sum the Reich could possibly pay . Last week , however , he appeared so struck by the figure $420,000,000 that , clapping on a Hamburg hat and greatcoat , he caught the Nord Express for Germany . <P> In Berlin florid Minister of Finance Rudolph Hilferding hastily assembled an informal and secret conference of richest Junkers and tycoons to confer with the tall , imperious president of the Reichsbank when he arrived . In the Fatherland , where such an assemblage represents the colossal vested interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take long to sound out the opinions of ' ' big business . " Therefore after only the briefest conference , " Iron Man " Hjalmar Schacht boarded the Nord Express for Paris , appearing to be , as usual , somewhat less gracious and communicative than a snapping turtle . <P> The press bureaus of the Allied delegations at this point issued unanimously the surprising statement that responsibility for the story of a $420,000,000 offer by the Allies must rest with Germany alone . <P> Since all sessions of the second Dawes Committee are secret-with no minutes or stenographic notes kept-the word of Germany is presumably as good as that of any other great power . " Believe it or not . " <P> Keen observers suspected from the first that something was amiss , because the " scoop " on the $420,000,000 offer was given to the Associated Press . Previously the inside news track on everything connected with the second Dawes Committee has been held by the New York Herald Tribune . This paper received as an exclusive " scoop " the paramount story that J. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris ( TIME , Jan. 28 ) . By way of humble return for so great a bounty , the Herald Tribune was the only paper to print , on its first page and in full , the following Monday morning , a prolix and tedious address by Mr. Young at a Manhattan church on Sunday night . Last week the Herald Tribune , unsuspicious , printed the Associated Press scoop , correcting it next day with an exclusive despatch from the very fountain head of second Dawes Committee sure-dope.
