On cold winter nights , outside the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan , cabdrivers shuffle and swing their arms . It is dull for them . The people they have brought thither , wait to remove , are not even sports ; they are music-lovers who give small tips , cold-eyed elegants in evening dress , or critics that ponder , as they read the meter , such terms as " a good performance , well sung , " " gala night , " " once more with a brilliant cast . . . " wishing to Heaven they could find a new phrase or change for a quarter . At regular intervals , the cabdrivers hear , from within , a prolonged rattling murmur which means that an act has ended and the nonsports are giving an imitation of enthusiasm . On a certain cold night last week , they heard that familiar sound ; it seemed curiously louder , nor did it die away . While they swapped butts , it grew , swelled into a steady , insistent , thunderous , stubborn volley , lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in silent amaze . ' ' Cheest ! " they said . <P> Inside , in the great warm hall , a shivering conductor shuffled his feet , besought silence ; the lights of the entr'acte dimmed ; still the great sound continued . In his dressing-room , a 28-ysar old U.S. baritone powdered his nose . Cast with the revered Scotti in the season 's revival of Verdi 's Falstaff , he had just ended the second act with the aria E sogno , in which he sets forth his suspicions that his spouse , Mistress Ford , is plotting infidelity with " that reverend vice , that grey iniquity , that father ruffian , that vanity in years , " Falstaff ( Scotti ) . The heat of his singing had melted his makeup . He had taken numerous curtain calls with Scotti . People were still applauding ? Doubtless they wanted the bronze-voiced Italian . He did not know that music lovers , cold-eyed elegants , smug critics alike were shouting through the applause , in the darkness of the house , " Tibbett ! Tibbett ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing-room door . A call boy- " Mr. Gatti wants you . Immediately . " Young Tibbett grabbed his robe . Gatti-Casazza , famed director of the Metropolitan , smilingly pushed him toward the stage . There , alone , he took his curtain call , bowed again and again . Then the opera was permitted to proceed . <P> It is 15 years since Falstaff was played at the Metropolitan . Verdi wrote it when he was 80 and full of frolic . He had composed so much that writing music was no longer an effort , and frequently as he wrote , he said , he was convulsed with laughter . The score is easy , melodious , lighthearted , reminiscent of Wagner iu mannerism rather than in poetry . Miss Bori was Mistress Ford ; Tenor Gigli , Master Fenton ; Mme. Alda , Nannette . All did well , But the critics , as they hailed their frost-bitten taxi-men and drove home , were replacing their familiar bromides with other phrases : " A scene quite without precedent " ( The New York Times ) ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors " ( The New York Herald-Tribune ) ; " An eager young man , who made music history when the brilliant audience lost control " ( The New York World ) . <P> At last a U. S. singer had brought down the Metropolitan .
