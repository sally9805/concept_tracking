 | WHAT women want now ? what they have wanted during the historic seventyyear struggle for their rights ? is equality ? equality with men as citizens of the tinned States . When the great victory came to them on June a. 1919 , and Congress passed the long-fought-for Susan B. Anthony amendment , the great mass of women exclaimed . " Now , we have won ! " But getting recognition for women in the venerated constitution under which we all live , vastly important though it was , after all was not a complete victory . For there are important political rights which men enjoy that are still withheld from women . The stumbling block is the old common law , that body of tradition and precedent and case decision so treasured by Anglo-Saxons , which contains so many restrictions that refer exclusively to women . Equality for women as citizens will come only when the handicaps of the common law are repealed by written legislation on our statute books . Civilly in the law of the family , women , as many know by experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is not so well known that there are important rights denied them which prevent their being the political peers of their brothers and husbands . The political rights of a man are the right to vote ; the right to hold public office ; the right to try and be tried by his peers ; the right to be a citizen in the land of his birth . Only one of these rights is extended to women by the Nineteenth Amendment ? the right to vote . The others are withheld in the main by the is great enemy of sex equality , the common law . which denies that woman is a person politically as well as civilly . These are the rights that women must now gain by state and national legislation . The woman juror is getting into the newspapers frequently these days . The news comes mostly from New Jersey , where the jury box turned feminine has caused much conversation on several occasions of late . There was the case of a dress pattern concern suing for money said to be due on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the store making the sales , whether it belonged to Antonio Pascarella or Mrs. Antonio . The jury of women decided in favor of the wife , finding that she was not the proprietor of the store and so did not owe the money . So favorable an impression did the , women make on the magistrate who tries this case that he summoned a woman jury for a second case at once ? a criminal case this time . The second jury of women tried a peddler who had been pulling teeth as a side-line without troubling about such formalities as a dentist 's license . He smilingly asserted that he was glad to have a jury of women , as he believed feminine leniency would save him . He was wrong , very wrong , for it took these twelve women just sixteen minutes to convict this toothpulling peddler . New Jersey is the first eastern state to call women for jury service , but its discov-  | ery of women 's capability as jurors merely duplicates the experience of various other states . In some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nineteenth Amendment , women have tried important cases , albeit they have been put through a kind of fast and loose game in exercising this ancient right of citizenship . When a man meets the voting qualifications of his state , he automatically becomes eligible for jury service . Likewise , local authorities in the western states assumed that when a woman became a voter , she , too , could be summoned to sit in judgment on her peers . Hence , women were called . qualified , and served . But when it was discovered that an old law existed which barred women from such service , the privilege had to be withdrawn , and the state attorney general was appealed to for opinion . In many states , he declared that special legislation was necessary to admit women to the courts as jurors . It is the common law and the interpretation of the word how to mean " male . " not " man " or " person , " that brings about this situation . In only two states in the Union ? California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old jury law been enacted . In a few other states women are being called ? and incidentally they are making mighty good jurors ? but they have no guaranty of this right , and their service may be challenged at any time . California women , since 1917 , when the legislature passed a new law fixing the qualifications for jury service without distinction of sex , have been serving on grand juries , petit juries , and coroners ' juries . They have tried many serious and complicated cases , acting on mixed juries of men and women and also as all-women juries . The only case of a woman tried for murder in a supreme court by an all-women jury happened in California some time ago . It was a case involving many issues besides the crime of taking life , and public feeling was greatly aroused about it . The verdict was acquittal . Deep conviction must have prevailed that the trial of a woman by a jury of women must be the embodiment of justice , for there was halt or no criticism of the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation-wide discussion . Since the passage of the Nineteenth amendment , effort has been made to find out how the newly enfranchised states will view the matter of jury service for women . In response to inquiry , it has been learned that the great majority of the attorneys general of these states lay it down in official opinion that women may not serve without special laws definitely nullifying the dictum of the old common law . A few leave a loophole for jury service for women without special law , with a proviso that this must not be understood as an official opinion on the subject . In some cases the state statute of jurors is so worded as to seem inevitably to include women in its terms , but the attorney general goes out of his way to point out that however favorable the present statute may look , the common law rules otherwise and must be taken into consideration in dealing with the loose terms of the statute . Says the attorney general of North Carolina : " Taxpayers of good moral character and intelligence are the sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact it would appear as if women were eligible ( as men ) . . This construction is not admissible because the term jury duty at the time of the enactment had a known and definite ( common law ) signification . . . as follows : a jury is a body of men . . The only way that women could be liable to such service is by act of legislature . " The situation with respect to jury duty for women is that a special law must he worked for in all  | but two of the forty-eight states . The best type of law makes the qualifications for men and women the same . Jury duty does not impose great burden on women as is sometimes argued , and women needed in the home , mothers of young children , etc. , would undoubtedly find no difficulty in being excused if called . Indeed excuse from service is freely granted for reasonable cause in the case of men . It was the attorney general of Arkansas who first made clear the probable line that decisions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states where women had suffrage before the Nineteenth Amendment was passed , there has been a tendency to let sleeping dogs lie , as it were , with respect to this matter , and allow women to run for office . But when Julia Ward Pennington proposed to run for the state senate of Arkansas , both governor and secretary of state turned to the the attorney general for the law and the prophets on this question . He replied in a lengthy opinion that the Nineteenth Amendment did not carry with it the right to hold office . The reason ? The common law again . Nothing , says the attorney general , in the constitution or statutes of Arkansas specifically excludes women . A " person " who is an elector may hold office . However , " when we come to consider the question more thoroughly , " . we find that a woman is not a person , for " by the weight of authority woman could not hold office under the common law . " The Only Way Out The only way that this common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in statutes or constitution granting to women this privilege . Such explicit statement is not to be found now in the constitution or statutes . Nor can it be said to be implicit in the lack of the word " male " in the statutes on public office , for in the words of an august authority " in construing any act of legislation . . or a constitution . regard is to be had not only to all parts of the act itself .. . but also to the conditions of the time and to the history . in the light of which the . . . act must be read and interpreted . " At the tune the constitution was framed ' there was no idea of giving women public office , so the only thing that can give it to her now is specific legislation , or constitutional amendment , bringing her within the scope of the word " person " as used of a public official . This is the substance of the Arkansas attorney general 's ruling . While the weight of opinion is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury duty , many officials take the same stand as the Arkansas attorney general . Others will not commit themselves at all . A few give out such qualified statements as " possibly eligible . " The situation is further complicated by the fact that some state constitutions use the term " male " public officials . Only one attorney general so far heard from has gone so far in the direction of equality as to say that the Nineteenth Amendment removed this word from the qualifications for public office when it removed it from the qualifications for suffrage . The others take the word " male " as conclusive . The recently enfranchised states have raised this new issue of women 's right to public office . The experience of the older suffrage states where it was never raised shows that women are a distinct asset in public office . Besides one woman in Congress , some twentyfive women have served with credit in state legislatures . The most frequent offices held by women in the western states are state and county superintendents of public education . Their record is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , North Dakota , Texas , Washington , and Wyoming have elected women state superintendents of education . @#  | That the people were satisfied with the women 's service is seen in the fact that from the time they elected a woman ? Colorado , as long ago as 1892 ? most of these states have never gone back to men superintendents . In the older western states the majority of the county superintendencies are held by women . For many years these very states have been among the foremost in the country with respect to education . Washington stood first among the forty-eight states in its educational system for a long period . It lost that position only because others of the woman suffrage states where women are conspicuous in educational positions have raised their standards so effectively . Two women state superintendents of education ? Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado and Josephine Corliss Preston of Washington ? are among our leading educators . During the difficult years of the reconstruction both were presidents of the National Education Association . Citizenship of the Married Woman " The identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisprudence . " This pronunciamento declaring the married woman 's lack of personality is from the decision in McKenzie vs . Hare ( 239 U. S. Supreme Court records , page 299 ) . This case , tried in the California courts in 1915 , had to do with an American woman , wife of a British husband and by that fact herself a British subject , who claimed her right to vote in the country of her birth . It is the only case on the married woman 's citizenship since the Law of 1907 , which declares the wife 's nationality to be identical with that of her husband . This decision , which adhered rigidly to the old conception of the absolute oneness of man and wife , stands as precedent for all cases of this nature . Citizenship is a matter under federal control . Before the Law of 1907 was passed , there was in the United States no written statute on the subject . Before that date , in many cases , wives were allowed to retain their own citizenship on marriage with foreigners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primary importance , taking precedence even over loyalty to the husband . Sometimes in these early cases a woman was permitted to choose her nationality between that of her husband and her own . The Statute of 1907 is the embodiment of the common law , even though decisions under the common law were not so consistent as they have been since the principle was fixed in the act . There is now no legal means by which an American-born woman can regain her status as an American citizen after marriage with a foreigner . except through such tragic events as desertion , divorce , or death . During the war , when many patriotic , native-horn women suffered cruel injustices and bitter humiliation because of alien marriages . various efforts were made to have this law repealed . In 1917 a bill was introduced into Congress which provided that an American woman should retain her own nationality without regard to her husband 's citizenship . The hearings on this bill ? which , however , did not pass ? brought out many facts demonstrating the hardship which reflected citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathilde Slidell d'Erlanger , an aged American woman whose husband was German . The declaration of war found her in Switzerland , where she was a veritable prisoner . For when she applied for admission to the United States she found its ports closed against her . Mrs. d'Erlanger was in frail health , elderly , and homesick . She belonged to a historic family , was the niece of Commodore Perry , famous hero of the Battle of Lake Erie , had been schooled in American patriotism , and did not want to die estranged from the homeland . Because the United States government classed this loyal American an enemy alien , she was allowed to enter her native land  | only by special permission of Congress , and that after much worry and long delay . Much might be said of the unjust involving of property through this law on international marriage . American women married to enemy aliens found their property seized during the war by the alien property custodian . This was held for return subject to decision at the close of the war . Nina von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably , so far as is generally known , been in harmony with her husband and not anti-German as long as he lived , filed a claim for her property sequestered by the alien property custodian and had it immediately handed back to her . Mrs. von Campe 's sister , Mrs. Louise de Haven Alien , also married to a German , was out of harmony with her husband , had twice brought suit for divorce from him . Because her husband was sent to the Front her suit was delayed . Mrs. Alien 's property , which , like her sister 's , came from an American grandmother , was also seized by the alien property custodian . However , unlike her sister , she did not immediately have her property handed back to her , and this notwithstanding the fact that she had been staunchly patriotic . and at the outbreak of the war , until she could get out of Germany , had persisted in wearing an American flag and in doing many kindnesses for American prisoners . Three times recently Congress has passed a special act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for Marguerite Mathilde Slidell d'Erlanger , for Frances Scoville-Mumm , and for Louise de Haven Alten ? when a general law wiping out the provisions of 1907 act would automatically take care of all women in like position . These cases are interesting in connection with the objection sometimes raised against permitting the wife of foreign marriage to retain her American citizenship ? that rich Americans who marry foreigners and leave their own country to live abroad have no ethical right to claim American citizenship . It was necessary for Congress to give special attention and pass special legislation to relieve these American women who had married titles or rich foreigners , who went abroad to live and tried to come home only after many years , when the war broke out , and who undoubtedly were influenced in their efforts for reinstatement as American citizens because of the money involved . On the other hand , it is the women of the poor and middle classes , who stay at home and are aliens in their own land , who can not vote in time of peace or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would be benefited by repeal of the nationality law of 1907 . The Popular Sentiment Lawyers have sometimes spoken of legal difficulties in the way of a bill to change the status of the woman married to a foreigner . In a questionnaire sent to judges exercising ju risdiction over naturalization throughout the United States , the question , " Are you in favor of the retention of citizenship by an American woman on marriage to a foreigner ? " brought two favorable answers to one unfavorable . There is at present before Congress a bill introduced by Representative Rogers . which gives the right to retain their citizenship to women who marry foreigners . This is supported by the National League of Women Voters as an essential part of an equal citizenship program . Definite knowledge of conditions that are unjust to woman is not unimportant . But specific information of what to do to get what women want now is much more to the point . There is an organization of widespread influence , the League of Women Voters , which includes all these things in its program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great organization is at work for state and national legislation to clear up the remaining inequalities of women 's citizenship .
