Announced , last week , was an anonymous gift of $3,000,000 to Harvard University , Cambridge , Mass . <P> The plan : to build in Harvard an " inner college , " housing about 300 students from all four classes ; to give these students the mutual social contacts of the small college while still offering them the intellectual advantage of the large university . <P> The plan was suggested by the Student Council Committee of 1926 . The students who will be admitted will be selected to represent as many different types and interests as possible . They will attend the regular University classes . From the University as heretofore they will receive their degrees . The " inner college " will therefore merely stress the contacts inter se which students at large universities do not often enjoy . <P> Eventually Harvard will probably have several " inner colleges . " Then in Cambridge , Mass. , will have risen an institution similar to Oxford University in England .                  @ @ @
