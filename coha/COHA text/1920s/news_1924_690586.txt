txt From the result of the Maine election tomorrow larger national conclusions are likely to be drawn than the facts warrant . There are other elements of opposition to Mr. BRE W STER than opposition to the ' Klan , whose favorite he is and without whose votes he could n't have been nominated ; and Mr. PATTANGALL is the cleverest and boldest politician in the State . There is no doubt of Republican success in Maine in November . Yep , in. one sense , the Maine canvass , even before the election , has given a dangerous blow to Mr. COOLIDGE . In-that canvass the Ku Klux issue ? racial and religious intolerance , a national issue , is overshadowing and cardinal . There and elsewhere the Republicans are afraid of it . They pretend that it is not national but local . This theory is a too obvious and shameful explanation . The Republican Party in Indiana , Maine , Kansas , Oklahoma is tied to the Klan . Both great parties were meaty-mouthed and cowardly about it in their conventions . Mr. LA Foithrre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVIS , impatient of the politic folly of the platform makers , condemned it. , In Texas and other Democratic States the Democratic Party put ' the unclean thing away from it . Where was , where is , Mr. CottmGE ? We-have been told ' that he would speak in his own time ; that he could n't be hurried . The time is Past . If he was clearly , emphatically and by name to denounce this pack of bigots , lie should have done it long before the Maine election . The indirect generalities which have been put forward by Mr. SLEMP impress and deceive nobody . Either Mr. . COOLIDGE holds his peace for mistaken reasons of policy and politics or he tolerates the Klan . The probability is that he has listened to the persuasions of small politicians who have urged him not to " throw away " good Republican votes in good Republican States where the party is run by the Klan . In any case he has shown himself by his silence deficient in judgment and in courage . He should have set himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There should have been no doubt in his mind of the essential generous resentment of the majority of the American people with this preposterous revived and muchembittered Knownothingism . If there was any doubt , the greater the opportunity for the display of courage , the one quality which Americans love most and find most seldom in their public men . He put the question by . It is now too late for him to answer it . Whether from , his own misapprehension of the situation or from reliance upon timorous politicasters , he has created an impression either of bad judgment or of faintheartedness . While he was playing the simple ruralist to the camera , the battle between tolerance and intolerance was going on . He took no part in it . This was an error and a weakness hard to Be forgiven or to recover from . As previously in his ineffectual dealings with Congress , the country gets a picture of a President who lacks the essential qualities of leadership .                @ @ @ @ @
