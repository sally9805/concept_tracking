CONDEMNED TO DEVIL 'S ISLAND-Blair Niles-Harcourt Brace ( $3.00 ) . <P> The Indictment . Every year France sends a dismal shipload of some 700 convicts to her penal colony in French Guiana - north of Brazil , southeast of Venezuela . Here the condemned , one-half of whom die in the first year , eke out a prison sentence with hard labor , followed by continued exile ; the avowed purpose being : " expiation of crime , regeneration of the guilty , and the protection of Society . " That the purpose has been sadly travestied is common gossip abroad , but Blair Niles went to see for herself . <P> The Witness . Author Niles achieved unaccountable permission to inspect gang prisons of the mainland and individual cells on the rockbound islands . She chatted with convicts , and followed the trails so many of them have hacked in vain through the jungle . Everything she saw was evidence of the demoded prison conditions that a twentieth century government tolerates . <P> The Evidence . Twenty-year-old Michel 's wooden pallet stretched narrowly between two seasoned convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he , as soon as he had learned from the " Aces " the finer points of his late thieving trade ? Well , so had many another expected , and moreover struggled well on his way to freedom when manhunters tracked him down , and goaded him back to the solitary confinement , disease and starvation of Devil 's Island ( famed for the incarceration of Dreyfus ) . <P> Gaunt from wretched diet , toothless from scurvy , the cynical oldsters were right that escape was not so certain . Six weary years dragged themselves out : lumberjacking or road-building under armed guards , restless hours in prison , philosophising , swearing , gambling for " mmes , " the girlish boys who were possessed by carnal strongmen . With luck bits of wood could be stolen and carved into salable boxes , or penny errands might be run for the slave-drivers , and bit by tarnished bit the price of attempt at freedom could be bought . Five hundred francs would bribe a bushman to paddle one convict across to the jungle , and buy a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered and bruised his way through to Paramaribo , only to be arrested as he tried to board a Dutch freighter , and shipped summarily back to an extra twist of the screw . <P> Broken in spirit and body , Michel became at last " liber " ( fantastic name for those wretches who survive imprisonment , but , exiled for years to come , must report periodically to the Guiana authorities ) . Meanwhile there was the listless scramble for barest necessities of existence . Few as these were after prison fare , the possibilities of work were fewer still , since employers preferred gangs of supervised prisoners available at minimum wage . Michel , marveled at his long-lost joie de vivre , remembered his ambitions , and the oath that never would he degenerate to a contemptible liber , crouched on his empty barrow awaiting a stray commission . But there he was , and there the Guiana vulture , bird of ill omen , flapped in the dust , croaked over dung in the street .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
