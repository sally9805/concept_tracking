" Dear Alfred : <P> " I am tendering you herewith my resignation as chairman of our finance committee , as a member thereof and as a member of the executive committee . . . . " . . . It is desirable for the public to know , as everybody in General Motors should appreciate , that the corporation is not , and in the nature of things can not be , in politics . . . . <P> " Sincerely yours , " John J. Raskob . " <P> " Dear John : <P> " I beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of July 23rd . ... " In view of your conviction that your duty as chairman of the National Democratic Committee will monopolize your time . . . and on account of the importance to the corporation as well as to yourself of making it unmistakably clear that the corporation takes no part in political affairs , we are constrained to accept your request to be relieved of all your duties in connection with the corporation . . . . " Sincerely yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Motors made it clear , too , that Finance Chairman Raskob of General Motors was unanimously expected to resume his business duties when Democratic Chairman Raskob 's job was over . But he reiterated that all General Motors officers , employes , dealers , stockholders were free to stand politically as each thought best . This emphasis , in both letters , made people doubt that too-much-work was the cause underlying the Raskob withdrawal . People said that the cause was pressure from within General Motors , notably perhaps from the six Fisher Brothers ( bodies ) , four of whom are General Motors directors and at least one of whom has contributed money to Hooverism. * Mr. Raskob called such talk " too ridiculous to discuss . " Smith headquarters were moved , as planned , into the Raskob offices in the General Motors Building . The net change was that the Brown Derby 's chief spokesman ceased to be the chief spokesman of General Motors . <P> <P> * Fred J. Fisher " and associates " gave $10,000 . The G. M. C. Director Fishers are Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , William A. Fisher . The other Fisher Brothers are Edward P. Fisher and Albert J. Fisher .
