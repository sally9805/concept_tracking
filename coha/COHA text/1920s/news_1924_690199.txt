Patrons who had made appointments for dinner - were turned away . And as the employes of the place followed them , they were met with jeers and cat-calls from scores of strikers . Meanwhile , large placards were placed in front of the restaurant . They read : " This place closed for violation of the National Prohibition act . By order of the United States District Court .

This place was the first one visited by the Federal officials , who had pre- . viously stopped at the law office of Wentworth , Lowenstein &; Stern , in the Knickerbocker Building . Forty-second Street and Broadway , where they for many served the court papers on Salvin , Thompson and the cabaret managers . Place All Set for Service . It was 6 o'clock when the marshal and his deputies reached the place . They found the tables set , cooks in the kitchen , waiters at attention and hat check girls at their stations .

" The prospective diners left the place in a daze after their orders were canceled . Some members of the Roger Wolfe Orchestra and several entertainers gathered up their personal property and departed . " Now ; I know what it feels like to have a newspaper shot under you , " remarked one of the entertainers to a reporter . ' This is a surprise to me , " said Roger Wolfe Kahn , son of Otto Kahn. as he entered the cabaret to chat with some of the members of his orchestra . He lent a willing hand to Kenneth Whitmet .. one of the orchestra players , who Was struggling to put the covers on the Musical instruments . The problem of removing the perishable food gave the attendants considerable trouble . Marshal Hecht decided to grant a respite of several hours so that the food , several cats and dogs , the musical instruments and the personal Property of the employes and entertainers might be taken away before the cabaret was sealed . Some Get Brief Respite . It was also decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word was sent out that the padlocks on the remaining places would be snapped into place this morning . The managers were notified , however , that their places could not serve dinner nor could they remain open for business as cabarets last night . In front of the Palais Royal a large exawd watched the departure of the employes . A man 4 ' in evening clothes , who rushed up to the door and saw the closing notice , remarked : " And this is where I was to meet her . " lila companion rolled up in a taxicab , and they went elsewhere for dinner . Patroposrha had . valci for tablq , Te313191k. were informed that their money would be refunded this morning at the Montmartre .

Yet , he said , he had ' the sorry comfort of knowing that he was only one of 2,500 employee made idle by the court 's action . After padlocking two of the three doors of the cabaret the officials moved around the corner to the Moulin Rouge . By this time the crowd had become so large that traffic was stalled and patrolmen were sent from the West Fortyseventh Street Station to aid the regular traffic officers in keeping open lanes for pedestrians and vehicles . Camera men snapped the marshal and his deputies and the popping of flashlights caused further congestion , which made the work of the policemen-difficult . Colonel Hayward Issues Statement , Colonel William Hayward , United States Attorney , in a statement issued yesterday called the decree " a tremendous victory for law enforcement , " and pointed out that 225 places which had violated the liquor laws had been padlocked since Jan. 1 . Here is his state-ment : " Por several years those in the know have been aware that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , most of the better-known cabarets in the city have been selling liquor , but only to customers known to them who have been relied upon to keep confidential the breaking of the law In which they participated . Many , of these places considered themselves , because of the wealthy class they catered- to . as above the law and immune because of influence . " Following out the policy of this office in its effort to enforce the prohibition law the same as any other law and with equal earnestness , whether it hit big or little bootleggers , or big or little bootlegging boats , we have sought to secure evidence against certain flagrant law violators . We finally secured sufficient evidence to warrant padlock injunctions against the places owned and operated by what is known as the Thompson-Salyin combination . " I consider this a tremendous Victory for law enforcement . It runs our total number of rum joints closed since Jan. 1 under padlocks , being Federal injunctions. to 225 . It Is an eloquent answer to those counselors of despair who say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landlords . " These padlock injunctions do sometimes , and are intended to , work a punishment or , penalty on-the landlords but It is up to the landlord to know what his tenants are doing- To force landlords to use their premises for clothing stores meat - markets , candy kitchens , bakeries , shoe stores , dry goods establishments , &c.,; instead of for saloons and rum selling dives can not but be of inestimable benefit to the moral and social life of this great city , and - we propose to keep on as rapidly as we can secure judges to hear and try these cases . " The liquor seller is being pushed off the main thoroughfare and into the byways and purlieus of the city , where , with the drug seller , he cap alone take refuge . " Any one who says that the situation in the city is not improving so far as law enforcement is concerned is either blind or perverse and it is my firm I opinion , concurred en by all officials who have studied the situation I believe , that but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking away of Ithe valuable machinery of the State the situation would now be as well in hand in regard to liquor as it is with any other class of law violation . " These cases were prepared for trial in a most effective manner by my as- sistsents , Major John Holley Clark and David SeighL " Means Big Moss to Owners . The six Broadway cabarets in the group of nine which were ordered padsocked were among the highest-priced cabarets in the city and catered to a large visiting clientele . Employes remarked last night that the sudden closing up of the restaurants prior to the Democratic convention meant a large loss for the owners and deprived New York 's night life of much of the dash and brilliancy which Broadway has always stood for in the minds of visitors . Whether the space occupied by the cabarets will remain idle for a , year is a question that remains with the Federal Court , and United States Attorney . It is believed that if the owners of the property give assurance that the places can be rented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! or such purposes , but not for cabarets or restaurants . The Thompson-Salvin group , which until his retirement - included Paul , father , of Samuel Salvin , owns a string of cabarets in Philadelphia , Chicago'and Atlantic City wise " to Broadway 's night life were generally able to buy Mawr at high prices in the cabarets . In some of the placeb itemized checks were unknown and diners were asked to - pay whatever the checks called for , with a $2 or $2.50 " cover " charge . Until late Jest ' night tradesmen 's delivery trucks drove to the Palais Royale and Moulin Rouge and , removed some of the , ' perishable foodstuffs to , hospitals and institutions , including Bowery batssierra.
