Into the darkened Manhattan dining room where 700 bigwigs of finance , industry and commerce were dining last week , went a procession of servants bearing on platters before them , not boars ' heads nor puddings blazing with brandy , but great candied cakes , each lit by 25 candles . It was a symbolic procession to mark , as the banquet and its other sequences marked , the completion of 25 years ' service to the New York community by the Bankers Trust Company . <P> The late Henry Pomeroy Davison founded the Bankers Trust in 1903 . He was then the energetic and radiant vice president of the First National Bank in Manhattan and the friend of many an important personage of Wall Street . When he gave a dinner it was well attended . At one such dinner he presented his idea of a trust company that would not compete for business with commercial banks ; but would act as the fiduciary agent for state and national banks throughout the country , and would accept as deposits the reserve funds of other banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed with the liveliest and most aggressive young men of New York 's financial district on its board of directors . Mr. Davison 's banking sagacity and charm had brought them together . He acted as their chairman ; Edmund C. Converse of the Liberty National Bank , where ten years before Davison had himself got his first important Manhattan banking job , went to the Bankers Trust as president . Thomas W. Lament was secretary &; treasurer . <P> The Bankers Trust was to become , after it added commercial banking to its activities , the sixth largest bank in the U. S. Meanwhile , Mr. Davison was to become a Morgan partner in 1909 , after he had further distinguished himself during the panic of 1907 . <P> When Henry Pomeroy Davison became a Morgan partner he was 42 years old ; 30 years younger than the late John Pierpont Morgan ( 1837-1913 ) ; three months older than the present John Pierpont Morgan . <P> Mr. Davison 's shrewd evaluation of the lively mentality and personality of Thomas William Lamont was influential in making him a Morgan partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davison also noted the persuasive powers of Lawyer Dwight Whitney Morrow , and greeted him as partner after the elder Morgan 's death . Dwight Morrow was 41 then . <P> Before the War , the Morrows , the Laments , the Davisons and the Thomas Cochrans ( Morgan partner since 1917 ) all lived in Englewood , N. J. , across the Hudson River from Manhattan . Since the War Mr. Lamont has become ( next to John Pierpont Morgan ) the best known Morgan partner and U. S. international financier . Mr. Morrow is currently the outstanding U. S. diplomat-Ambassador to Mexico . Mr. Cochran became the Morgan partner on the board of General Motors , and , like Mr. Davison before him , chairman of the executive committee of the Bankers Trust Co . For Henry Pomeroy Davison died in 1922 , aged 55 , having given to the Red Cross so much of his apparently limitless vitality that there remained too little for himself .
