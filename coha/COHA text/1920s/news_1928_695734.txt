txt pact-finding has now become almost uaiversal . Committees and commissions to find out facts are the order of the ' Jay in municipal , State and national affairs . Any head of a public depart- inent who did not have a fact-finding body at work for him would feel that he had been derelict  --  at least , not up 10 date . But facts , as an old political philosopher remarked , are stubborn things . They take a lot of scrutiny before they yield themselves up . And then there is , as BROWNING reminded us , in ad inquiring minds that sort of " instinc : ive theorizing " which makes the fact look to the eye as the eye likes the look . When all possible facts have been discovered , the need remains that an ' irganizing and interpreting intellect should take hold of them and tell us ? that they really mean . Especially in political matters is a " formula " reeuired to hind together the available material and make it a basis upon which to build . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed upon ascertained facts of vital interest to them all , a formula-maker is ' lore than ever necessary . This function has been described by An opponent of the British Foreign Secretary as what has chiefly been occupyeig Sir AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN during 7de past year or two . He has been the great formula-finder for three countries . BRL4ND for France and Dr. STRESEMANN for Germany meet and exchange views and express desires , but are unable to hit upon the form of words in which to embody their hopes and purposes . Then they turn to Sir AUSTEN , who nicely discriminates their points of difference and agreement , and finally invents the phrase in the use of which all can happily unite . Such is the explanation offered for the terms of the Locarno treaties , for proposals regarding the evacuation of the Rhineland , for the appointment of a new committee of experts to recast Germany 's obligation to pay reparations , &c.; The anonymous article in The Fortnightly Review which thus outlines the recent activities of Sir AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN is meant as an attack upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The suggestion is that British foreign policy must have sunk very low if it has thus become little more than a reconciler of the policies of other nations . The picture is of Foreign Minister BRIAN ) chuckling to himself , after one of his long conversations with STRESEMANN , because he is convinced that the British Foreign Office will find for him a verbal solution beyond his own power to devise . This , according to the Fortnightly writer , has for some time made Sir AuseEN CHAMBERLAIN little more than " a catspaw of the Quai d'Orsay . " Such an accusation , when stripped of its political malevolence , comes pretty near to being a tribute . In the present state of world affairs , any public man who has the authority and skill to indicate a way of getting around obstacles and of arriving at working agreements certainly plays a useful role . This is not to say that Sir AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN has always been happy and successful in seeking adjustments , or in the manner of announcing them to the British people . The abortive naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was badly conceived in itself and sadly bungled on the side of publicity . Sir AUSTEN himself has frankly admitted the mistake , and spoke with regret in the House of Commons , before its ad4ournment for the holidays , of the way . in which that blunder had temporarily clouded the relations between England and the United States . That unfortunate procedure has now been left for the dead past to bury . Both England and France and Germany and the United States are turning their faces toward new agreements . First of all comes the Kellogg treaty . Then there is the prospective meeting of the Preparatory Commission of the League of Nations on Disarmament , at : inch the American Government will again be represented . These and other pending questions require a great deal of preliminary fact-finding . But still more important will be the formula-finding which must follow , if the facts are to be translated into fruitful international understandings . All honor will be due and will be yielded to the man or men by whom the desired formula is worked out .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
