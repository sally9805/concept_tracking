txt ten good-naturedly , and with it goes enthusiastic appreciation of the charm that London has for an American  --  its constant recalling of loved historic and literary memories . What troubled the visitor most , evidently , though she does not say so , was the unfamiliar standards as to the warming of houses that she found everywhere in London . The difference troubles the British as much when they come over here , and they wonder how we can live in our indoor temperature , just as we do at their ability to be happy in what to us is serious discomfort . The same phenomenon exists in this country , however , and the Northerner who goes down South in Winter is apt to do more shivering with cold than he would in Maine or the Adirondacks . Of course , the British when at home have a right to their own opinion as to what is comfort and what is not , but one reads not a little in British novels of red-nosed women going about wearing shawls in their so delightfully cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are as happy as they pretend to be . TOPICS OF THE TIMES . A Brooklyn woLondon Hotels man whose verses Surprise have often Amuse. apand peared on this page is now in England , and has written to a friend an amusing account of her observations and experiences in London . She is far from being an Anglophobe , but evidently thinks that the British could learn just a few things from America to their advantage . She says , for instance , that " the English have proved often enough that they know how to die gallantly , but it will take them at least two centuries more to learn how to live comfortably . " She admits , however , that perhaps she is arguing from the special to the general , her opportunities for observation as yet having been limited chiefly to two hotels , both of excellent standing . The first , she wrote , had a reputation for being " rather gay and dashing , " but " I , " she hastily added , " would as soon go to a cell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think why anybody would live there unless sentenced to do so as a punishment . " Then she goes on : It was there we made our first acquaintance with English plumbing . ( I do n't mention heating . because there was none . ) Either the plumbers of England are her real humorists , or else the submerged complexes of the British come to the surface in her plumbing . Certainly no two English plumbers or manufacturers of fixtures ever thought alike . Every bathtub Is of a different and highly original type , every tap and stopper works with a different trick , with entirely different  --  and unexpected  --  results . My second hotel has a reputation for exclusiveness and elegance ; it even lodges ladies-in-waiting and young princesses , and the other people in it do show the marks of breeding and aristocracy . But the elegance would make you laugh .

I am conscious of being the object of an infinite patronage which enrages me , while I am trying to be polite about their old obsolescences . And they are absolutely self-satisfied in their ignorance or disregard ( it must be the latter ) of life as it is lived in the rest of the world .

GEORGE OWEN Jr . is the writer of the article . He refers to himself very modestly as having " played football for four years " and as " fortunate enough to be al member of winning teams . " People who know athletic history will smile at that , fos they are well aware how much Mr. OWEN " himself contributed to the winning done by those teams . Certainly it Is from inside , personal , knowledge that hel discusses football , and not only does he say  --  that it was not a pleasure for him to play the game , but he asserts that for the great majority of the players it is not a pleasure but a " grind , " which they would avoid if they could resist the vehement influences which a college brings to bear on any man who gives evidence of possessing football ability . Those who really like football , he declares , like it as a fight , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a more or less cruel task , performed under an almost crushing sense of responsibility and an agonizing fear of contributing to defeat . The graver faults of football Mr. Owls puts next to wholly on the alumni . It is they , he says , who have raised the game to its absurd and-outrageous importance as an clement in collegiate life , they who ha* made winning its one object and losing a horrible disgrace , they who Judge a coach , not on his influence in developing character in the men he trains but as a manufacturer of vietortes , they who call for the coach 's instant banishment as a fraud and a fool when the team loses and laud him to the sky if it wins . None of this does Mr. OWEN like , and seemingly he did not like it when he was among the most brilliant of football stars .

First held in 1022 , as a result chiefly of efforts to interest the public made by General OLivga P.

It will begin at 3:30 in the afternoon with a parade of the flags up Fifth Avenue from Thirty-fifth Street to St. Thomas 's Church at Fifty-third Street , where a special service will be conducted by Dr. Spates , assisted by Dr. Dm-warm of the Church of the Heavenly Rest , and an address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Corps .
