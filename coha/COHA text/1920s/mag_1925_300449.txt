Near Mr. Kennerley on the deck of the Majestic stood Jules Mast-baum , cinema magnate . He submitted to the routine of cameras and notebooks with such a look of satisfaction as a man might wear who had just nipped off the end of a fine cigar or buried his nose in the bouquet of an old bottle . <P> Or perhaps he did not wear any such expression - perhaps it was merely the fancy of the beholders to perceive it , for everyone was thinking that Mr. Mastbaum had reason to be , and even to look , satisfied ; he was returning from Paris where he had bought 98 Rodins . <P> " Imitations , of course , " suggested the dubious . " Originals ! " thund ered Jules Mastbaum . The purchase , which involved a year 's negotiations with the French Ministry of Beaux Arts and with M. Benedite , venerable curator of the Musee Rodin , includes The Thinker ( one of the five bronzes cast from the original mold ) and reproductions of Adam and L'Ondre from the group at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the SesquiCentennial Exposition at Philadelphia next year . <P> That any man could go to Paris and purchase 98 original bronzes by a sculptor who ranks in the very thin and isolated company of the world 's greatest artists , appears incredible-would be impossible , if it were not that Rodin , all his life , created images in stone as rapidly as if to do so were a natural , an inescapable function of his body . An eminent critic once stated that Balzac , the novelist , was not an individual but one of Nature 's forces , like fire or che wind ; Rodin was treated with the same sort of primary electricity . He left as many wrought stones as a volcano -a giant 's spawn , beyond precise inventory ; countless groups of lovers , nymphs , Naiads , Tritons , Muses . <P> Many people who know nothing and are capable of understanding less about sculpture are excited by the beauty that they instantly apprehend in Rodin ; they grasp without effort subtleties of intention that the sophisticated perceive only tortuously , after elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration of the theory that only a stupid man has any capacity for learning . It contains two secrets of Rodin 's brooding intellect that ' are also the secrets of his popularity : <P> First , he saw the beauty of the world , as in imbecile might see it , with the eyes of innocence . To understand him it is unnecessary to understand anything that happened before him except the creation of man . Second , he expressed what he saw with a graphic accent . His sculptures are stone syllables of a speech men suddenly realize that they know .
