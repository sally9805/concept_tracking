The report submitted by the Dawes Committee to the Reparations Committee contained 44,000 words-a sizable book. * In the space of nine hours every word was transmitted from Paris to the Associated Press , Manhattan . Within 24 hours it was delivered , complete , to six American newspapers , viz. : The New York Times , The New York Herald-Tribune , The New York World , the Philadelphia Public Ledger , the Washington Post , the St. Louis Globe-Democrat . <P> The longest despatch ever cabled , it was sent by regenerating repeaters over four cables . " An unparalleled feat , " said Newcomb Carlton , Western Union President . <P> A telegram is punched out in a series of dots and dashes . But a cable streams along from an inked " syphon " pen in angles and curves like a fever chart . Curves above an imaginary line are " dots " ; curves below are dashes . The number depends on the curve length . The operator reads in words , not letters .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
