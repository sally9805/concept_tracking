Quicksand . Theatrically , lawyers get themselves into the most disturbing jams . This lawyer fell in love with the woman whose husband he was defending on the charge of murder , only to find both man and wife members of a harsh crowd of criminals . Eventually he escapes from his dilemma by sending the wife to jail for five years and planning to have the sentence quickly cut down . Such proceedings call for no small amount of insight and ingenuity to make them credible . A good deal has been supplied , but not enough . The play works itself up to a pitch of considerable excitement and then subsides , fizzling feebly . Robert Ames , who sometimes acts in the movies , availed himself ably of the opportunities of the leading part . <P> Spring 3100 is the telephone number of the Manhattan police headquarters . Accordingly one might reasonably expect a stern diversion dealing with the police department on duty through a bloody evening . But the play , of all things , is a dream fantasy . A pugilist is hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed to explain what a pugilist thinks about when he is knocked unconscious . It seems this particular pugilist wanted to be an architect and marry a maid above his station . His distrustful manager suggested that if he persisted in these inflated notions he would land at police headquarters . These disheveled inventions are woven into a play , mad enough to fool most of the spectators for much , of the evening . When the hero took the stage and exterminated virtually the entire troupe with revolver shots it was patent that something was askew . Tangles and untangles , it was fairly good fun . <P> <P> Hot Pan . The adventurous and inquisitive Provincetown Playhouse tucked darkly away in downtown Manhattan has made another rabid experiment . One Michael Swift , distressed at many phases of U. S. life , particularly at the craze for gold , has collected his complaints in a play . He sets it in the California gold rush days and much of it occurs in a boisterous bar . Gold is discovered under the floor . There is a gold rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey . There is no pretense at connected story . Mr. Swift is seemingly as much at war with dramatic forms as with this world we live in . Flashes of vivid satire , bits of brutal delight gleamed in his dialog like gold nuggets . The rest was sand and water . <P>
