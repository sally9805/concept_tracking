The newspaperman of fiction is either " hardboiled " or a cub in the seventh heaven of innocence . But the newspaperman in life is generally a man whose chief interest is his own business of gathering news and an amazing admiration for those who adhere to the fundamentals of that business . He is likewise susceptible to the most fundamental pathos . <P> A good example of the combination of these traits occurred last week . The following dispatch appeared in The New York Herald Tribune : <P> KINDERHOOK , N. Y. , July 10. - Sought by state troops , Boy Scouts and posses of citizens since his disappearance Wednesday , James Wynkop Roney , nine-year-old son of Garner P. Roney , an assistant city editor of The Herald Tribune , was found drowned in Kinderhook Creek here today . <P> Early Thursday , however , Boy Scouts searching along the creek came upon the boy 's bicycle and clothes on the bank . Divers at once went to work to locate the body , and after hours of effort it was found by Frank Gearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risked his own life in attempts to bring it to the surface , so tightly was the body enmeshed in underwater weeds . A rowboat and grappling irons were brought overland from Kinderhook Lake and the body was secured . . . . <P> As an introduction to these words the Herald Tribune printed : <P> Garner P. Roney is a newspaperman by instinct and by virtue of long training in the practices and traditions of his profession . He recovered the body of his only son from a creek near Kinderhook yesterday ; but even while he was broken by the greatest sorrow of his life , he realized that the finding of the boy 's body was news and that his paper should have it . So he went to the telegraph office and wrote the story for what it was worth as news , wrote it as calmly and as dispassionately as if the boy had been a stranger instead of flesh of his flesh and blood of his blood . <P> This pathetic action is in the eyes of newspapermen one of the heights of nobility-a height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a similar situation . For them , it ranks with the heroism of the telephone girl who sticks to her post in a fire , is parallel to , the devotion to duty of the old Roman who executed his own son for disobeying military commands .
