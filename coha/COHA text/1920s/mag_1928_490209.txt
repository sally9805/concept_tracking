ONE reason play censorship has never worked is that the persons who feel called upon to attack and defend plays usually have muddy minds . When " The Night Before " was hauled into a Brooklyn court , the lawyer for the Actors ' Equity defended it on the ground that it portrayed a conflict between good and evil , and virtue was triumphant . Therefore , he said , the play is moral . Well , the old question comes up  --  what of it What has triumphant virtue to do with whether a play is salacious or not Virtue is triumphant in the statue of Abraham Lincoln in Union Square , but look at it ! With plays , as with anything , the question is one of taste as between artistry and obscenity . And , as always , when it gets into court , some strange skeleton such as triumphant virtue walks out from behind a door to the confusion of everybody . TANGERINES are now in season . They are easy to peel , and tasty , but to the best of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict social usage . Each segment contains pits , and it is necessary to put a whole segment in the mouth at once .

Only one hostess of our acquaintance has met the awkward situation with anything like imagination  --  she supplies each guest with a little paper bag and has the butler switch the light on and off at intervals . ROUSING quietly to ourself in %. - 3-  the backroom of a speakeasy , whither we had gone against our will to accommodate an out-of-town visitor , we allowed our eye to rove over the objects that lay on the proprietor 's desk . At first we scarcely took in the significance of the objects , but gradually the thought came to us that it might be interesting to discover just what a speakeasy proprietor occupies himself with during business hours . The following articles ( over and above a marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , lying open , from an iron works ; Katherine Mayo 's " Mother India " ; a copy of the Boston News Bureau ( a financial publication ) ; Bernard Shaw 's " The Intelligent Woman 's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism " ; and the New York Times . ABOUT half of the graduates of Princeton want to go into the diplomatic service , according to thrilling statistics which we 've been reading . But , the story continues , most of them go into business . We know why that is , too . Business is more complex and far-reaching than it used to be , and requires more Princeton graduates to carry it along . Just how amazingly complex it is was thrust home to us the other night when we were listening in on the radio and learned that anyone may receive a bottle of a certain kind of mouth wash free by writing to the radio station at the Hotel McAlpin . There you have it in a nutshell . Big events are going on right here at home , and it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go frittering away their time in some foreign country , just because they want to . SOMETHING must be done toward settling , once and for all , the argument between residents of Jersey and residents of Westchester over the relative merits of their suburbs . Let two of them get together , and the evening consists of nothing else . This is apt to prove tedious to a Manhattan dweller who takes his suburbs as they come . In our innocence we recently undertook to entertain two darnosels , one from Larchmont , the other from Montclair . After twenty minutes of first-class buffer work we dropped sullenly off to sleep on the settee , between them , and awoke several hours later to find they had gone  --  presumably their separate ways : On e on the 11:30 from Grand Central , the other an the tubes from Thirty-third Street , Lady From Spain AFTER a performance La Argen-tina is so exhausted that she is often literally carried out of the theatre and home to bed . For this reason the Spanish dancer has kept pretty much to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep-ing . A visit to the Horse Show and one or two teas have been about the extent of her social ventures in New York . We hear that she was not altogether prepared for her reception in this city , which was the most enthusiastic ac-corded any dancer since Pal/Iowa 's debut . La Argentina was delighted , but somewhat surprised , that her three first performances were sold out in advance and that speculators bought up great blocks of tickets . She once danced here to small crowds  --  in 1916 at the Maxine Elliott Theatre  --  hut that was before she became truly famous , which was shortly after the war , when she made her first appearance in Paris . In Spain she has been widely acclaimed since she was very young . Her father was a Castilian and her mother an Andalusian , both Spanish bolero dancers , and their daughter made her debut in the Royal Spanish Opera at the age of nine . Even so , she has not been " spoiled , " her managers say , and they find her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her morning- recitals , recently , directly from a Boston train . Asked if she had slept well , she said : " No , but one must expect that sort of thing " ? she speaks little English , by the way , talking usually a mixture of Spanish and French . A tranquil temperament is said to account largely for her vivacity and youthful appearance , for she is appreciably older than she looks . She does not smoke and is extremely temperate in all matters of the sort . Her daily life is quietly ordered ; she has developed no fantastic hobby , dresses rather more conventionally than otherwise , and never wears jewels . Her managers expect to bring her to America again next year  --  whether with her ballet or not they have not decided . The expense of transporting her company was held to be prohibi tive for this year 's visit . La Argentina herself brought some eighteen trunks of costumes , which caused considerable excitement at the pier . The dancer is considered the greatest castaneti.st in the world and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned in Spain of the finest rare hardwoods and their making is almost as much of an art as making fiddles . We were interested to hear that the castanets for each hand are different one pair is known as the male and the other the female . The female castanets have a high , sharp click and elaborate on the basic rhythm of the music , the time for which is beaten by the male pair . Good castanets are valuable and improve with age . It takes years to learn to play them well , and a finished artist can produce effects which seem incredible to the layman . Hard Feelings DRIVING hack from the Yale- Harvard game , a Lincoln limousine decorated with the Yale colors bumped from the rear a Chevrolet which flew the Harvard colors at its radiator cap . The small car immediately stopped , went into reverse , and gave the limousine a good smack on its front bumper . The contest ended with some words but without further scoring . Metropolis AN exploration last week of the New 1 1 , York Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground hallowed by the old Madison Square Garden , aroused us from our usual indifference to the clockwork of big buildings . Descend-ing to floor 0-3 , for example  --  the third of five basements  --  we came upon the structure 's pneumatic ter-minal , the largest clearing house of its kind in the world , and as strange a room as you will encounter in any German futuristic movie . Great hat-terics of white curved funnels gape over smooth wooden tables . Roaring and clicking , these tubes discharge every few min-utes hundreds of leather pouches containing letters and documents which are being transferred at sixty miles an hour from one of the thirty floors to an-other . When thins get THE NEW YORKER to going in full swing , a dozen men will man the terminal tubes in the basement and a hundred others will be stationed about at the various chutes on the other floors . In the mailroom a dozen floors up , a replica in miniature of the basement terminal , another battery of tubes spews out a constant stream of outgoing policy payments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , $15.83 is paid out by the company ; ten thousand of its policy-holders have died so far this 1-ear . Payments amount VI approximately one hundred and thirty-nine million dollars a year . The several thousand people who work in well-ordered precision to keep up with this march of death moved into the new building last week from downtown , like an army terrible with documents ? one of the vast sub-basements holds seventy-five million documents . It took four days to move things . Working as we do in an office where a small boy carries communications from one room to another in his spare time , we were deeply impressed by this milea-minute organization . Deep down in the fifth basement there are giant boilers , and in the fourth basement a mammoth master clock . Both ends of the building roar ? the lower basements with their boilers and pneumatic tubes , and the tower with its gigantic air shafts for ventilation soaring upward and out . Mr. Cass Gilbert , the architect , has so designed the chimney that it appears to be a turret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen smoke emerge from the fenestrated chimney decorated in gold leaf , and who remember the Sherry-Netherland , have turned in fire alarms . In a magnificent suite of offices on the thirteenth floor , President Darwin P. Kingsley holds sway over his little city . We were permitted a peek at his inner sanctum and also a glimpse behind some books on one of the shelves of his library . These particular hooks are false ones painted on a wooden panel which swings open to reveal a small figure of Shakespeare seated in thought upon a bench . Mr. Kingsley is a great admirer of the bard . This note of tranquillity and meditation is more representative of the organization as a whole than is any detail of noise or flurry . There are quiet recreation rooms for shuffleboard and cards , a hospital occupying half a floor , bright dining-rooms decorated with pink flamingoes , spick and spankitchens , private tiled showers for the cooks and such . The employees seemed absurdly contented  --  just a happy family of three thousand people with shuffleboard games and pneumatic tubes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Humanity , as the company calls it , where once stood the little depot of the Harlem Railroad into which sleepy horses , never dreaming of what was to come , used to pull absurd little passenger cars . Sabots AA MAN who actually deals in ships I and shoes and cabbages and who might even dig you up some sealing wax  --  is Mr. Frank Teeuwissen , proprietor of the Franklin Lunchroom at 318 River Street , Hoboken . In addition to being owner of the little restaurant , Mr. Teeuwissen is also captaM of a freight barge , and sells wooden shoes . Captain Teeuwissen imports the shoes from Holland , his native land , and sells about a thousand pairs a year  --  to workers in bologna , ice-cream , and leather factories , where the floors are slippery , and to stokers on ships , where the floors arc lint . Czar of the Saucer TI1E six-day bicycle race , which starts this Sunday , will be run under the shadow of what has come to be a steady feeling of discontent among the riders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the occasion of the last race , but it seems that the restlessness has intensified . The cyclists blame their attitude on Mr. John M. Chapman . Mr. Chapman blames it on the riders . He is the man whose word is law in the six-day race . He decides who will ride with whom , a great source of trouble often ; how much the men will be paid , a greater source of trouble ; and he can bar any rider from the track with a wave of his arm , and sometimes does . Recently the bad feeling culminated in an outlaw movement led by such prominent secessionists as Charlie Winter , Bobby Walthour , Jr. , and certain of the foreign riders . So far their independent organization has not accomplished much  --  a race Set for last week in competition with the Garden grind was called off for some reason . The outlaws claim , however , to have contracts for a summer of racing on a new Coney Island track next year , out of which they expect to make more money tha n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he is called , takes the revolt calmly . He has downed many an uprising in the past . Usually the rebels have to come to terms with him , for since 1919 he has got such a hold on bicycle racing , here and in other cities , that competition rarely succeeds against him , and rebels arc likely to find themselves out of a job . Last year Chapman admitted that the race is no longer a competition but a spectacle , for which he pairs the riders as he thinks the public likes to have them paired , which usually means that the two best men ride together . That system militates against the other teams ' chances to get in the money , and causes grumbling . Back in the nineties Chapman was a bicycle rider himself , but gave it up to promote races in Salt Lake City . There he featured the Australian , Jackie Clarke , the champion of his day , and his success with the foreign rider led him to import other stars from abroad . Under his regime comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later concentrated on Newark as a bicycling centre , with the backing of Frank Million , a Newark resident . Inglis M. Uppercu of the Cadillac Company , and a native of Newark himself , at that time had a motordrome across from the Million Velodrome , and established a bicycle track there in competition , but finally the two were combined . Out of the deal Chapman got a considerable sum of money and a big red automobile , and retired to his home in Georgia . The new manager of the Newark track was one Floyd McFarland , who was later stabbed to death in the velodrome , and Million and Uppercu got Chapman to return . He has amassed a fortune fur his associates and himself , how much he wo n't say , but it is commonly believed that the profits of a six-day race are around two hundred thousand dollars . The race-track dictator is a stocky man whose steady eyes peer from behind thick lenses . He is vice-president as well as general manager of the Madison Square Garden Corporation . His riders account him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On his farm in Georgia he has had built , for his mother to enjoy looking at , a replica of the log cabin in which he was born . Deduction ABOUT a week ago a midtown cafeteria was held up by a bandit , and one of the detectives assigned to the case began his investigation by questioning the proprietor . " Was this robber a tall , thin man in a dark suit ? " he asked . " No , " said the manager , " he was a short , squatty man , with a light gray suit . " The policeman frowned and began to study the floor , his chin in his hand . He did not ask to interview any of the employees , nor did he go over the scene of the holdup . He just thought . Finally he looked up with the expression of a man who hasfigured out something . " Just as I thought , " he said , " it was an inside job . " Old Rellables THOSE who loiter in the rear of the Opera House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Bruno Zirato peering through the parted curtains of the exit door . Mr. Zirato was the last secretary to Caruso ; and he is one of four gentlemen , familiar to Metropolitan attaches , upon whom the opera house exerts a certain spell . Although these gentlemen have been i. - " seen about the main lobby and the promenades almost every night for years , the story goes that none of them has ever heard an opera out from overture to finale . Mr. Barthold Neucr of the Knabe Company isanother of them . He worked for years to have the Knabe piano installed as the official opera-house instrument , and finally succeeded . Most any night now you can find him about the place , but rarely inside except for a snatch of singing here and there . The third of the old reliables is Mr. William Thorner , vocal teacher , whose attachment for the Metropolitan was formed when his pupil , Rosa Ponselle , won fame there . The fourth man is Mr. Ernest Henkel , who , before the growth of the present subscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held sway over the claques . He is no longer an official attache of the house , but is always there as of old . Speaking of claques , they have , of course , largely passed . In the old days , when largesse was distributed with an open hand , many free seats were given out , particularly for the Italian operas , and Mr. Henkel devoted most of his time to allocating those complimentaries . Nowadays , with subscription performances the rule , from ninety-five to ninety-eight per cent of the house is sold out in advance . The few unsold seats arc at the extreme sides of the dress circle , in the last row of the orchestra circle , and a scattering in the grand-tier boxes . These are advertised for public sale on Thursdays for the following week , but long before Thursday they are bought up by friends and relatives of members of the company . Although these people no longer get in free , they are loyal enough to their favorites to perform the functions of the old-time claque on a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the identity of these over-zealous applauders in order to disbar them from mass formations in the future , but without much success . Our recent mention of the omnibus box , which was formed by knocking out partitions between several boxes in the grand tier , moved someone to direct our attention to the two seats in the fourth row orchestra which have again been taken by Mrs. Henry Stanton Leverich for Monday nights . The arm which once divided these seats has been removed  --  the only pair of the sort in the house . The Leveriches have subscribed to the same seats since the opera house opened , and in the early days the family had so much to say regarding arrangements that when Mrs. Edward Leverich , mother-in -- law of the present subscriber , asked that the arm be removed for greater comfort , the Metropolitan officials indulged her whim . THERE are ladies left in this world 1 of bustling business women . One such was entering a subway train the other day when a guard shouted in her ear , " Step lively ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wish to tarry , sir , " she said , and entered with dignity . Superintendent of Telegraph and Reporters some weeks ago , but it is hard for floor traders to realize that he has gone . He had become one of the landmarks of Wall Street , and as such he is deserving of some small , if belated , memorial . Bamford ( Richard L. in full ) has gone to live in Hackensack , after forty-five years of hurlyhurly , for as far hack as the eighties he was a Morse operator on the Stock Exchange floor , one of nine selected men . Later he was elevated to " key man " and sat on the eighth floor at a transmitter which looked like a dial phone , over which he flashed stock prices telegraphed to him by the operators on the floor . Bamford was known as the fastest of the operators working for the Exchange in his day . As key man he used to be relieved every fifteen minutes because of the strain of the fast pace at which he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in those days , however , be cause sales averaged only a hundred thousand shares a day . Today the one hundred and twenty men employed in recording quotations can not keep the ticker abreast of the market . Even before he became an operator on the Exchange , Bamford had a reputation . He had been the first telegrapher to send a complete report of a baseball game direct from a park to a newspaper office  --  this he did for the Sun from the old National League haseball field in 1586 . Despite the great dignity with which , for twenty-five years , he started off the battles between bull and bear on the Exchange , Bamford 's principal interest has always been telegraphy , not trading . Expert operators do not use the slow , single-action instrument , but a fluttering , double-contact transmitter they call " the bug . " Mounted on a desk in the library of his Hackensack home is Bamford 's finger-worn hug . A floor trader who visited him there says he fiddles with it from time to time .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
