L IFE has passed through many phases since it first made its appearance on our cooling planet . Each age is characterized by what palaeontology calls " leading fossils " ? the predominating types of animals and plants . There are characteristic leading fossils for each phase of life 's evolution on earth . But if one surveys the latter from the highest possible point of view , from which only the most general outlines are visible to the eye , then one is led to say that there has been a predominance on earth , in turn , of the cartilaginous fish , the amphibian , the reptile , the marsupial , and eventually the mammal . This is the current teaching of paleontology . But is it really true that the age of the mammal is the last we know of ? Let us apply the time-honored notions of geological formations and leading fossils to our modern age . Then we can not help admitting that we no longer live in the geological period of the predominance of the mammal in general , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creature showing all the qualifications needed to de- serve the honorary title of " leading fossil , " it is modern man . No giant saurian ever put its stamp upon its age in any such degree as modern man does . Man changes the course of rivers and drives tunnels through mountain-chains , not to mention his subjugation of all other living beings . But on the other hand , this is true of modern man only . If the statement of the Bible is correct , man was already proclaimed the Lord of Creation in Eden : as a matter of fact , he was nothing of the sort even two short centuries ago . Indeed , from nature 's point of view , he was just one creature among others , superior in intellect always , but so weak in other respects and , above all , so deficient in numbers , especially in his most gifted varieties , that only blind conceit could make him believe that he actually ruled the earth . And as a matter of fact those religious and philosophical leaders whose ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man as an earthly power . Within the Hindu system , natural man was just an animal  | among others , and his soul could easily transmigrate from a human to an animal body . Within the Chinese system , the cultural history of man stood on the same plane as the succession of the seasons . And the truly Christian Age ( it is past to-day ) did not look on man as an essentially powerful , but as an essentially weak creature , entirely dependent on Divine Grace for his prosperity . To-day , however , man has attained the position assigned to him in Eden . Today he is the Lord of Creation . Which chiefly accounts for the fact that the religions and philosophies in the basic conceptions of which man appeared without any predominance whatever within the rest of creation are irresistibly losing their hold on the minds and souls of men . We are , then , no longer living in the age of the mammal in general , but in the age of Man . Once we have realized this , we perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in : it is not only a phase in human evolution , it means much more : it means , geologically speaking , that from the pre-human stage man has reached the human stage proper . For it is science and applied science and nothing else which has made of man in the course of the last centuries the Lord of Creation in the natural or earthy sense of the words . But on the other hand , it was precisely the possibility of the development which he has now actually reached which always distinguished man as an animal from other animals ; this is why prophetic spirits could visualize him as the Lord of Creation even in pre-Babylonian days . Man has really come into his own with the technical age . This , then , explains why the age of so-called progress has been characterized by such an unparalleled vitalization of those who participated in it as pioneers : they felt that it was their privilege personally to reach the goal for which the whole of mankind had been groping for millions of years . This also explains why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed : man felt himself to be in a situation similar to the finish on the turf ; after having gone more or less evenly for a long time , so as not to exhaust the resources of his horse prematurely , he now saw the winning-post before him and went fullspeed to reach it . But it explains many more things . It explains why technical civilization irresistibly conquers our whole planet . Mortal man is an animal among others : this is the meaning of the current saying that human nature never changes ( as indeed it does not ) . The elementary instincts which call for expansion and power and lust rule man 's conduct as primarily as they rule every beast ; if there is nothing to check them , they run wild . And there has been nothing to check them on the plane of technical development ; for no religion or philosophy of the pre-human days ( I am again using the word in the geological sense ) foresaw its possibility . Thus technicized man started to conquer the earth as ruthlessly as any saurian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor cousins which stood in his way , did technicized man conquer and enslave or else exterminate such races of man as had not attained his own degree of technical development . However , this was only the first phase of the process . Soon all human races , black , yellow , brown and white , realized that technical civilization really was the heritage of man as man ; much more so than political freedom , since the latter was obviously of little use when not allied to power . This , then , explains the tremendous rush for " technization " we have been witnessing since the Great War ( which , by weakening the European nations , gave the others their first great chance ) all over the world . The real soul of Bolshevism is not a particular form of government but the promise to give to all and sundry of the oppressed races the benefits of technical civilization without making them the slaves of foreign capital . The same applies , mutatis mutandis , to the emanci- pation-movements in the whole East . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the country in question be . To that extent these movements are irresistible : man as such will not be kept out of his own as the leading fossil of the geological Age of Man . There is , therefore , no possibility of stopping or checking technical progress , as so many idealists hope for . Should a form of civilization , even the most beautiful , stand in the way of the animal aspirations in question , it will be destroyed , as indeed the Chinese , the Turks and the Russians have already destroyed their own old traditions ; the animal impulses are always the stronger the more primitive the race . Obviously a new geological epoch must assert itself most clearly where man made an entirely fresh start at the beginning of that epoch or soon after it had set in . Here lies the explanation of the most important difference between America and Europe . But this also explains why Bolshevik Russia and America are so much alike . Russia has violently shaken off all the fetters of its past traditions , and although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of a new animal ideal has of a sudden drawn Russia quite close to the United States . And the same will be the case with all those rejuvenated races which have thought it necessary to shake off their past in order to begin a new life . In a very short time all of these will gravitate either toward the center , the symbol of which is America , or toward Russia . II But it is high time now to explain clearly why I call the American ideal an animal ideal . Is it not an essentially human ideal ? Does it not make for better living , for what Americans mean when using the word democracy , for higher civilization ? Of course it does . But it makes for all that only for man conceived as an animal , and not as a spiritual being . America 's most essential and most representative ideal is that of a high standard of living . Now there is nothing whatever to be said against this ideal as such . It is obviously better to live comfortably than uncomfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of the general good will , the lack of jealousy , envy , and resentment in the United States as opposed to what we see in all poverty-stricken countries in which poverty really does mean privation of what makes up the joy of life ( which it does not in the tropics , for instance ) . But what animal , if it could think , would not enlist under the banner of the highest possible standard of living ? Almost all the typical manifestations of present-day American life are not only expressions of the ideal of a higher standard of living ? they really start from the assumption that man is nothing else than an animal and must be dealt with accordingly . Which again goes far to explain the likeness between America and Bolshevik Russia . In order to make quite clear what I am driving at , I must insert a few general remarks about the difference between man and the other animals . Every organism is , on the one hand , an essentially responsive being ; its life evolves in response to stimuli and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , every organism is a being which lives in its own right as the expression of a qualified autonomous life-force . It is impossible to explain any phenomenon of life without recurring to both of these two factors , which are essentially independent of each other . But the autonomous life force in the case of all plants and animals is , roughly speaking , a constant factor ; it manifests no more initiative than does heredity with man . The latter 's problem is different . In man the life-force , which is autonomous everywhere , becomes ( or can become ) focussed in the  | conscious endowed with free imagination . And although what I said of the animal organism holds also true of man , namely , that the direction of his life is determined by the stimuli it responds to , yet personal initiative plays the decisive part . It does not play a decisive part along the lines of his animal life ? but wherever specifically human problems arise , wherever the meaning of facts seems more important ( as it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts themselves , the initiative of the spirit and not the pressure of the surrounding world is finally decisive . And the higher man rises as a man , the more important does this meaning-giving quality become . The sage is almost independent of outward events ; to him they mean exactly what he makes of them , not only in the subjective but also in the objective sense , as is exemplified by the lives of all truly great men who have met with and conquered adversity . It is characteristic of the American outlook , that it almost entirely overlooks the properly human side of man . There are , of course , many exceptions to the rule ; indeed , there are very powerful counter-phenomena . But the very exaggeration with which the autonomy of the spirit is asserted there ? I am thinking of course of Christian Science , New Thought , and all that is akin to them ? goes to prove the strength of the prevalent point of view . This point of view has found its adequate expression in the theory of Behaviorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the opposition already mentioned ) is a Behaviorist at heart , whether he knows and acknowledges it or not . John Dewey is also essentially a Behaviorist , only he knows too much about the soul to be a Behaviorist pure and simple . In John B. Watson the typical American attitude has become fully self-conscious and it has expressed itself with all the exclusiveness and onesidedness required from the point of view of style as well as of successful action . I do not doubt that one day John B. Watson will be considered as one of the foremost representatives of what the United States stood for in the Twentieth Century . What is the essence of Behaviorism That man is an animal like any other . That spiritual initiative and free will play practically no part in his make-up and conduct . That concrete " habit " stands for the whole of man 's vital activity ? there is no beyond-it in the sense of a possible metaphysical or otherwise spiritual reality . And that habit can be explained , determined , and ruled and changed entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a theory is hardly ever to be found in its intrinsic truth ? most theories are lamentably onesided or short-sighted ? but in its psychological significance . In this sense the most interesting aspects of Behaviorism are its mere possibility and its representative quality . That there could be anything like Behaviorism and that it should be such a success , proves that Americans do look upon themselves in the light of animals ; they find nothing within themselves that should necessitate any other theory . Behaviorism holds that any phenomenon of life can be explained and brought about from without , by external influences , and that spiritual autonomy plays no part . There are hundreds of thousands of Americans and hundreds of institutions which officially proclaim the contrary belief . But all the facts combine to prove that the real , and in many cases the national , point of view is that of the Behaviorist . During my stay in the United States I had to consult a doctor because of symptoms possibly due to over-work . He said to me : " You need n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used to that . Mine is as good as yours . But it has never formed the habit of thinking . " This sounds rather crude , but if one were to render what John Dewey has to say about education , about the forming of the right kind of habits beyond which he , too , does not recognize  | any metaphysical reality ? his last premise is society ? in the phraseology of the average American , used to thinking in headlines and slogans , I doubt whether one could find a set of phrases more expressive of the real situation than the above quotation . Man is not different , in principle , from any other animal . Partly for that reason Democracy , as the doctrine which teaches that all human beings are originally equal , carries conviction to most Americans . Man has no unique soul , for doubtless no animal owns one ; all differences depend on surroundings , wherein training is included . The last resort is the " community , " the highest values they know of are social values . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That Bolshevism is a distinctly materialistic creed and that Behaviorism is not , makes no difference as to the essence of the matter . There is something entirely novel in mass-education as it is practiced in the United States and Russia . This novelty consists in the fact that man is consciously treated as an animal . From the idea of appropriate surroundings , whatever belonged to the concept of traditions ? and traditions formed the bulk of prescientific educational environment ? is excluded . Man is supposed originally to be just an animal ; what he develops into is thought to be entirely a matter of natural stimulation in about the same sense as the frog in the laboratory inevitably responds to specific stimuli in a specific way . Education is to " build in " satisfactory habits and to " unbuild " unsatisfactory ones , exactly as chemical compounds can be synthesized and broken up . To a man in whom ancient traditions are alive , this idea of turning out the desirable type of man by mechanical processes sounds absurd , as indeed it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by such methods . But things are very different in the case of types without a cultural past . The whole American nation is beginning its historic life on the new plane of existence of the geological Age of Man . This is an entirely new , an unheard-of state of things . Before the geological Epoch of Man , increased knowledge always meant higher development on the lines of a tradition begun before the Age of Man proper ; since the latter epoch has set in , scientific development has become the starting-point of a new phase in the existence of animal man . And since it is this animal quality that actually predominates , it is only logical that in all respects man should see himself in the light of an animal and , as a matter of fact , he does so whether he interprets his attitude in terms of materialism or Behaviorism or even the most spiritual form of pragmatism . III There can be no doubt whatsoever that this new way of envisaging man purely as an animal is the way of preparing the road toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new basis of the geological Epoch of Man . Traditional education no longer calls out vital forces except in the case of exceptionally creative individuals . Henceforth , all the cultural and spiritual problems must be re-stated and reset in the right relationship to the new basis . Mankind has returned to the animal stage for a while . It must first get settled upon its new basis . And in the meanwhile it really can do no better than evolve the animal nature on animal lines , with the utmost energy , by means fit for animals . We know to-day that most bad habits in the widest behaviorist sense are due to pernicious external influences ; we also know that most psycho-analytical complexes which develop in later life may be prevented from developing in youth by the right kind of education . We know , moreover , that a tremendous number of the desires and actions which men imagine to be the result of purely inward necessity are in reality the results of a  | combination of social opportunity and necessity . Therefore , we should take every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing life from the outside and by scientific method . And here again we see why it is that young countries like America and Russia must be the leaders in this movement : those in which the traditional culture is still alive can not see man in the light of the animal only ; they know too much of his spiritual nature to do that ; they can not make up their minds to that one-sidedness which alone leads to success . Not that they are by any means done for ? far from it ; as we shall see later , their task is even more important henceforth than it ever was before . But it remains true , nevertheless , that on the line of the new adjustment of animal nature which has become necessary the young nations play the leading part . The wonderful progress and expansion of the United States not only in business and on the lines of material and technical development , but also on those of education and scientific research , are primarily due to the primitiveness of the American . He could shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one belonging to the spirit , because in the process of rejuvenation he could no longer visualize its reality . This circumstance enabled him to go ahead as an animal with a self-assurance no man of spiritual consciousness could afford . Of course , the American has spiritual needs ; but these he satisfies , in accordance with his true state , by primitive forms of religion and philosophy . Christian Science , from the scientific point of view , is a form of Shamanist religion ; Fundamentalism is one of the crudest expressions of Tabooism I know of ; and the Reverend Billy Sunday plays upon the instrument of the savage tribesman 's fear-mechanism with the most consummate skill . I mention these forms of religion because I have an impression that the more normal churches really no longer play a part worth mentioning in spiritual life : they have become too much of a success for that and are developing too much on the general lines of big business . As to their members ? most Americans undoubtedly belong to their churches in no other sense than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their Rotary Club . There is , then , progress in the absolute sense in most American achievements which are psychologically based upon Behaviorism of some kind . But as is always the case , here too complete success breeds danger . The more primitive a man , the more he is inclined to generalize ; here lies the root of all superstitions . And if he can solve so many problems to his satisf action by considering man in the light of a mere animal , he is naturally inclined to believe that all problems can be solved in the same way . The soul of American institutionalism and educationalism and , to-day indeed , the active soul of practically the whole nation , is the belief that everything can be changed and perfected from without ; that environment means everything ; that the autonomy of life and the free initiative of the creative spirit can be completely discarded . An amusing simile may help to reveal the peculiar quality of American institutionalism . The Abbe Mungier , one of the rare Frenchmen I have known who still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once asked by a devote whose life , I am afraid , had not been altogether blameless , whether he was sure that there existed such a thing as Hell . His answer was : " Ma el-tare enfant , evidement it y a un enfer puisque notre tres sainte Eglise l'enseigne , mais la misericorde de Dieu etant infinie , je suis a peu pres sur qu'il n'y a personne dedans . " When presentday Americans think of making their nation musical , they believe that they have done everything that is required when they have built a beautiful institute and endowed it with millions . That the existence of music depends entirely on the talent of a few personalities , that institutionalism entirely misses the point  | where spiritual values are concerned , rarely occurs to them . Very few American Mvicenases realize that to pay men of science and art less liberally than railway presidents , in a country where a high standard of living is a national ideal , inevitably makes for mediocrity on scientific and artistic lines . The same applies to capacity for statesmanship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , which circumstance largely accounts for the lack of talented men in the political field . In Europe a talented statesman , scientist , or artist could and can be underpaid because he always was and still is considered so immeasurably superior in quality to any man merely able to make money , that inferiority in material means really only compensates overwhelming advantages . There is no equivalent to this point of view in American public opinion . The latter simply does not believe in the intrinsic value of genius and talent . It does not really believe in it even in the domain of business , although exceptional talent is recognized and paid here as it is nowhere else . Exceptional salaries are paid simply because such salaries are proved to be profitable and remunerative to those who pay them ; no employer knows or would admit that talent is of value in itself . The soul of American institutionalism , then , is the belief that institutions as such are everything and the creative soul of man means nothing . Man always becomes what his environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , perfectly logical to give everybody what is considered to be the best education and to expect that thereupon the general level will inevitably rise in every respect . But as far as my observations go , all thinking Americans realize that the general level has not risen . We have given the reason : American institutionalism looks upon man in the light of an animal . And this must needs make of him as much of an animal as he is able to become . IV I wish to repeat once more that I consider it an unequivocally good thing that animal man should be able to attain to such all-round satisfaction as he attains to in the United States . And the fact that there is so exceptionally little ill-will , resentment , envy , jealousy , and pettiness in American life proves conclusively , in my opinion , that it is a good thing not only from the point of view of the body , but also of the soul . To that extent there is even nothing to be said against uniformity and standardization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amount of uniformity and standardization of material life is inevitable ? you can make millions equally comfortable only if their requirements are alike to a large extent ? and the disadvantages of that necessity are doubtless smaller than its advantages . But the disadvantages begin to be seen when the spiritual requirements , too , are taken care of by methods appropriate to animals only . This is the fundamental vice of American civilization : its topsy-turviness . Lafcadio Hearn and Basil Hall Chamberlain have described the Japanese solution of the problem of life as being topsy-turvy from the European point of view . Yet the Japanese topsy-turviness is nothing as compared to the American . The latter 's topsy-turviness consists in this , that it attacks almost every problem of life from the wrong end . If marriage is to be a success , one should obviously begin by marrying the right person . The Americans apparently do not think so ; they try to cure bad marriage by better divorce . It seems desirable that a sense of the beauties of nature be developed : the Americans then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that there is no beauty except when man sees his idea of beauty into the things ; nature seemed beautiful to an earlier civilization , because nature 's objects were thought of as incarnated Gods . The American nation is to become  | musical : the finest institutions in the world are being created never mind whether there will be anybody to live in them . After my first lectures , I was again and again perplexed by the experience that people came up to ask me : " Was n't the audience wonderful ? " In Europe it would be an insult pure and simple to talk to a speaker who gave his best ? whatever this best may have been -- about the merits of his listeners . But soon I understood . The idea was simply this : if this man could attract a large audience , and if this audience remained attentive for an hour , then he must be a good speaker . In the same way a bestseller must be a good book ; or ? as an American Ma cenas recently put it ? one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents . From this there is only one step to the conception that a book which is not expensive or a bestseller , or a man who does n't make much money , can be no good , and that money provides the right standard on all planes and lines . This has nothing to do with dollar-madness : it is simply an illustration of that topsy-turviness which is the most salient characteristic of present-day Americanism . The American nation has been so consistently educated to believe that spirit can in no wise be the cause , but that it is an effect in the sense that it responds only to stimuli and can do nothing without them ? that it involuntarily thinks and acts as though the effect were the cause even where it knows better . Here lies the real root of that national belief which most Americans simply explain by the word " democracy " ? the belief that the judgment of the man in the street provides the absolutely right standard . This belief really means that there is no such thing as an autonomous spirit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no standard of value which might be considered valid independently of its standing the pragmatic test of material success . If the public does not like a thing or a man ? why , then , it or he is bad or wrong or useless . On the other hand , if the public likes it or him , then there " is money in it or him . " This , again , adds to the prestige of the idea that money-worth provides the real standard . Moreover , money always makes for comfort . And if money is made under the assumption that the taste of the man in the street counts first , the making of it by one or a few really is of profit to all . When we remember that the American ideal is originally an animal ideal , we are ready to understand that the topsyturviness is question must be exceedingly difficult to cure . It does stand the pragmatic test so well ! And its disadvantages are detrimental only to the few , not to the many . And even to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of good advertising the highest qualities can have a higher market value in the United States than anywhere else in the world and , therefore , the spirit finds more support there than anywhere else . This is quite true . But it is equally true that this topsyturviness , just because it leads to good results in all sorts of lines , blinds the eye for spiritual reality and its intrinsic laws . A typical American can not understand why a spiritually conscious man will rather be hated by all and sundry than conform to the prejudices of the masses . He can not see why " being liked " by , or even making for the happiness of others can not be , for the spiritually conscious man , an aim worth aspiring to . Yet , if the spirit is really powerful in a man , he can succeed in America in spite of the aforesaid , because of the exceeding suggestibility of the American nation . But there are very few who have sufficient suggestive power . And worse still : human nature being weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of their family , or whatever the pretext may be , when they are successful . In any case with every successful year the nation develops more and more on the lines of spiritual blindness . The salesman 's point of view prevails  | more and more . Many Americans told me , when I talked to them about that extraordinary book in which Christ is represented as the model of a good salesman , that it meant nothing and that the writer was just a fool . I do not think so . America at large really does think that way . The idea of the book in question is that Jesus Christ did not succeed in Christianizing the world because He had a great and true message to deliver , which later on inevitably resulted in " good publicity , " but that from the outset he thought only of the latter . All my personal experience makes me believe that this is the real because the involuntary general American point of view . Were it otherwise , would newspapers and publishing houses think almost exclusively of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business point of view is the legitimate one for a man who is demonstrably capable of commanding and directing public opinion ? Were it otherwise , would the sales-manager play a more important part in American business than the inventive spirit ? The inventor 's position is a truly " ancillary " one , as was that of philosophy with respect to theology in the Middle Ages . From the point of view of the spirit as the creative essence of life , such a lifeview is topsy-turvy in the absolute sense . Yet it would be the normal view , if man were an animal . This , then , brings us back to the central argument of this article . America would not be topsyturvy if man actually were an animal . But unconsciously Americans view him as one . And the aforesaid topsy-turviness in its turn helps toward the materialization of this belief . It makes for the progressive animalization of the American . The American really becomes a product of his existing institutions . He does so , because he believes in their unlimited power . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal " with every succeeding year . And with that likemindedness the tendency to conform to existing institutions in its turn inevitably increases . If the belief that externals account for everything is strong enough , they do indeed . Here lies the chief reason of American suggestibility . The Americans would not be more suggestible than other people , and on the basis of it , advertising would not be so immeasurably more successful there than anywhere else , were it not for the Behaviorist belief that man 's life is nothing but " habit " and that every habit is the outcome of given external influences . In this connection , the life of the United States presents the image of one single , gigantic , vicious circle . V Now let us proceed a step farther . If " environment " is believed to account for everything ; if , accordingly , it achieves as much as the laws of nature permit ; if , on the other hand , standardization is a fact and uniformity an ideal , then man 's life must become very much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that ants and bees are the most " human " of animals . The reverse , too , is true : if civilized man reverts to an animal-type , then he does not become an ape or a dog , but an ant or a bee . For these insects are the most social and at the same time the most hard-working of animals ; they are , moreover , the animals most bent on specialization and the most rigid in their routine . They do not in the least resemble primitive or savage or even cultured man ? these have their animal counterpart in the lion or the fox or the race horse , as the case may be . But they do resemble technicized man . It is the distinctive quality of the latter , that routine-work plays the principal part in his life . Now the routine of the ant , and in particular that of the termite , is wonderfully adapted to the rhythm of the Universe . The termite has so far held its own as no other creature has and it will probably continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same may happen to technicized man . Only if it does , it will be at the expense of all free initiative .  | It is a fact well worth meditating , that most Utopias written of late , which were based on American conditions , foresee a future state of utter serfdom ; freedom of will practically would count no more . This will indeed be the case if the Lifeless is to give the law to the whole of Life . This will be all the more so the more perfect the antlike co-operation grows . If human life becomes essentially a routine , the rhythm of which fits into that of the world at large , then a state of tremendous stability must follow . For such a life inevitably stands the pragmatic test . It can not help being a complete success . It must become more successful with every step on the line of standardization . Everything will prosper ? except man 's spirit . The latter must decay . For spirit lives only in the dimension of free initiative . And this must needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its present lines . The animal side must needs grow to ever greater bulk and power . Facts as such must more and more become the one thing that matters . When I came to the United States my first inquiry was : which are America 's most current superstitions ? I always inquire into the superstitions first when wishing to understand a nation , because they are much more representative of the unconscious , which is a very nonrational thing , than anything reasonable . Then I found to my amazement that Americans believe in ? facts ; everywhere and in every possible connection . I never have come across so quaint a superstition . In the domain of life facts never are primary things ; significance creates them on the one hand , and on the other , they derive all their value from the significance they embody . And significance is never inherent in the facts themselves . Every institution originated from an invention which was not a fact in the beginning . The power of a government is based upon the authority it has ? and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on belief . And so does the value of the most objective value on earth ? gold ; if people did not believe in it , its " facts " would mean nothing . Exactly in the same sense does the factside of " democracy " depend on what it means to men . Whether physical love is a beautiful or an ugly process depends on the meaning attached to it . And so on . The belief in facts is , from the point of view of man conceived as a spiritual being , really the quaintest and at the same time the grossest of superstitions . It can be explained only by the topsy-turviness of American thinking . But since in reality significance creates the facts , and not vice versa , the topsyturvy belief actually does create a world in its image . And this again means that the animal side in man , as opposed to the human side proper , grows stronger ; the significance of the facts , which really makes them human , grows ever less important . The final result is that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we not alarmingly near such a state ? Love is already being considered as a purely biological function ; health is the supreme ideal . The American is progressively losing sight of the fact that what distinguished man from the beast is precisely his lack of equilibrium , for that alone enables him to keep on striving beyond himself . Health is a purely animal ideal . It was one of the deepest truths given by Christianity that ill-health is a more normal state for spiritual man than health . The latter means a stable equilibrium . But an equilibrium can be stable only if there is no change . If man progresses inwardly , a destruction of the equilibrium previously existing inevitably follows . The more spirit , which is Movement Eternal , predominates in man , the more unstable must his state of balance be . This is the reason why from the point of view of the man in the street every spiritual man has always been less " good " or " nice " than any fool . Besides , spirit acts on earth only by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In this respect health is really an antispiritual ideal . The idea of health , then , contributes in its turn to the animalization of the American . But the same is also true of education , as it is generally understood . It is becoming more and more a form of training such as animals can be submitted to . The ideal of a high standard of living will eventually end ? if the process should reach its natural goal ? by becoming the general denominator of all ideals . Herewith man would retire from the adventure of human life proper and revert to simple and safe and secure animality . Viewed from this angle , the American habit of appraising everything in terms of the dollar seems a very dangerous thing indeed . For it simply means that the ultimate significance of all human ideals and values should be to make an animal feel comfortable . And this again would imply that the charming human qualities of the American , his directness , kindness , and simplicity , would have to be attributed not to higher human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious or pretentious or malicious beasts . This is the great danger which threatens the United States . Russian philosophers , true to the doctrine of Early Christianity which they all unconsciously profess , have raised their voices several times to warn mankind against the American ideal ; their idea is that there are two kinds of Satanism . The one expresses itself in terror and cruelty , the other in comfort . And the latter is by far the most dangerous . No doubt , inertia is the law of matter as opposed to spirit . Wherever routine predominates , spirit dies . And very likely the routine of comfort is the most stable of all routines . The condition of America is no doubt more critical , from the point of view of spiritual progress , than that of Bolshevik Russia , because the terrible material condition of the latter country must needs keep the spirit awake . Russia can be reborn at any time . A tre- mendous effort will be required , if the same is to happen in the United States . .. . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , this victory would mean more for the general progress of mankind than any previous spiritual conquest . For then spirit would for the first time find itself secure upon the basis of accepted material comfort , which it never has been heretofore . VI Before I end , I wish to draw the attention of my readers to some other dangers . Man , developed into the Lord of Creation , is the most dangerous animal that ever lived . Not only for others , but also from the point of view of his own welfare . He conquers and destroys everything he can not use . To him nature is nothing but raw material . Of this , again , present-day America provides the best illustration . In America there is no sense of beauty as a motive power of any national importance . But such a state of things is highly dangerous . Beauty is the result as well as the expression of right proportions . If there is ugliness , this always means that the right equilibrium has not been attained , or else it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains a child of nature ; if he acts as her master only , repudiating his childhood , she will take sooner or later a terrible revenge . We Europeans have realized that mere intellect , if developed at the expense of life , becomes its enemy , bound to destroy it as a quality first , and eventually as a fact . The creative powers atrophy . But American technicism presents a still greater danger . If only business counts ? I use the term in its most general sense ? then none of the purely human powers , as opposed to the animal forces , have any chance to grow . And since the lifesource of man lies in the spiritual , this must lead to physical devitalization . To my mind , this provides the ex- planation of many things which every intelligent observer of America must notice when taking the measure of American man . Notwithstanding the tremendous energy which he shows in special fields , he is very much less vital than the European . If he is not infantile he more often than not looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American civilization is a termitoid state . The termites are the most ancient of all creatures . But when they live their termite-life they still live out their whole nature . Man as a termite would not . He would leave unexpressed , more and more , all human powers . And since his real essence is human , he would probably die out . A life which is untrue to its own meaning never lasts . This largely accounts also for the neurotic state of an appalling percentage of American business men . And many of them have become truly antlike . They can see no other point of view than their own . They can do one thing very well and rapidly , but beyond that they can do nothing . Very quick in their accustomed lines of action just as the insects are , they are incredibly slow in all others . Will the Americans become ants , after all ? We said that this could not happen because they would probably die out first . But there is a more hopeful outlook and with this I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high standard of living will reduce itself automatically ad absurdum , making room for a higher ideal before it is too late . The higher the general standard of life becomes , the more difficult will it be to find human beings for the lower tasks of life , which will always have to be fulfilled . Then , one of two things is bound to happen . Either foreign slaves will be introduced in large numbers , or else the nation will make up its mind that it is not possible to continue forever in the assumption that material progress must indefinitely go on . And in both cases the only possible solution will be to restore spirit to its true place . One can rule slaves only if man as such means more than the " thing " ; if initiative means more than adaptation . And man , as an essentially striving being , can inwardly put up with stationary conditions , and not very satisfactory ones at that , only when he seeks and finds satisfaction for his striving nature in dimensions where there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
