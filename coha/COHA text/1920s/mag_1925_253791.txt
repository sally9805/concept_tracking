The Great Business Man Fictionized ? <P> <P> One of the most difficult of tasks for a writer is that of changing the public 's opinion of him . It is true not only of writers . The clown is forever wanting to play poet . The great decision that many writers , young and old , must make , do make , is to throw over everything in favor of a career of purely creative writing . The metamorphosis of writing from avocation to vocation is apt to involve many pains , bodily as well as mental . I know one boy who has given up the life of a sailor to write poetry . He goes without meals to carry out his ambition . Another , unwilling to let his wife go hungry , works by the hour in a shirt-waist factory , reserving enough hours to finish his plays . Success may crown their efforts ; it may not . <P> Arthur Train 's double decision , to give up law and to change his style of writing , was a difficult one to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a determination to succeed which has followed him through life . Having written many books in spare hours , having become known as a writer of stories of law , lawyers , crime , its detection and of humor , he found himself at middle age determined to break with his habits of life and to become a sort of American Galsworthy . He wrote , therefore , His Children 's Children , * which caught critical and public fancy . He has followed it with several other books , among them , The Needle 's Eye+ and Marriage la Mode , about to appear serially . <P> I like Mr. Train 's attitude toward his writing . He knows life as only a good lawyer can : His books are in the nature of problems . He plans them , attacks them , carries them to completion , as lie would brief and carry through a case . His books are now popular . <P> When you meet him in the comfortable study of his New York home , you meet the successful lawyer , son of a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man you can easily visualize as he must have looked when he took his position as prosecuting attorney . This personality he now gives to letters with the same quiet determination . He is still young ; and the shelf of his own books is already large . He has written wisely of American society and business . There is no reason why he should not some day write that penetrating study of the great American business man which has yet to be put within pages . In " Uncle Shiras " of The Needle 's Eye he foreshadowed this . Such a novel burns to he written ! <P> <P> J.F <P> *His CHILDREN 'S CHILDREN - Scribner ( $2.00 ) .
