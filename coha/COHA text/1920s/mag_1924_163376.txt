The treason trial ( TIME , Mar. 3 ) of General Erich von Ludendorff , Herr Adolph Hitler and eight lesser heroes of the " Beer Hall Brawl " recorded a five-hour speech by Hitler and a four-hour speech by the General . <P> Herr Hitler , taking up the main line of the defense , attempted to show that von Kahr , ex-Dictator of Bavaria , and Reichswehrgeneral von Lossow were inculpated . As this pointed to Bavarian Prince Ruprecht himself the trial was temporarily closed to the public . <P> But the General 's speech-ineloquently written and ineloquently read-was heard by a full house . When he had finished , his friends began to apologize . As a politician the General had shown himself again incompetent . His defense consisted in attacking Socialists , Jews and Catholics in a Catholic country : <P> " I am an old man . I became old under the heavy burdens of the war , the physical efforts I was forced to make , and through my struggles with the people . Nevertheless , my heart is young and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my people themselves . <P> " There can not be the slightest doubt of my attitude towards the Communists . Before the War this Marxist world turned against every military power . Herr Scheidemann said to France , ' You are not our enemies , but our friends and allies . ' Therefore I am opposed to all Marxist and Communist elements . <P> " In connection with this is the Jewish question . I made its acquaintance during the war . For me it is a question of race . Little as the Englishmen or Frenchmen can be permitted to obtain dominion over us , so little can the Jew be permitted . Freedom of the nation can not be expected from him . Therefore I was against him . <P> " When peace was signed the Pope did not act as a neutral man , but he favored France . This was illustrated by a letter written at the time of the sanctification of Jeanne d " Arc . " <P> Finally , after attacking Cardinal Faulhaber , the General gave his monarchical credo : <P> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasty for the nation . When Germany finds itself it will have a dynasty ready to serve it . I wish the German Empire to be strong and free and belong only to Germans . "
