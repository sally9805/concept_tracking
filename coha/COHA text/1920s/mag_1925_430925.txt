THEY staged a battle over in the London Zoo recently . The keepers turned a thousand or more animals loose , urged them to attack each other , and before the melee was over , several hundred had been killed and many others badly wounded . The London newspapers carried running accounts of the fight ; excited spectators came to view it . Why was such a thing allowed ? Well , you see , all the " animals " were ants . That made it pretty safe for the human onlookers . But if you think that the battle was any less ferocious or deadly than a combat between tribes of wildcats or herds of elephants , you are mistaken . The ant , when properly aroused , can give any animal lessons in ruthlessness . The most remarkable thing , however , was the way in which the opposing armies planned their campaigns and conducted their attacks . It was proof of that illuminating remark made by the great English naturalist , Sir John Lubbock , when he said , " Of all animals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The remarkable intelligence of the ant , which makes him one of the most versatile creatures alive , has long aroused wonder ; and here is a demonstration that he can use his brains in the heat of battle as well as in the calmer days of peace . IT ALL started on a bright Monday morning , when one of the keepers at the Zoo placed a little wooden chip , not on an ant 's shoulder , but over the moat that separated two ant colonies ? an old one that had been there for three years , and a new one just arrived . The chip served as a bridge , and for the first THEY found nothing . All the new ants were hidden away in their nest , unaware of the catastrophe impending . The wise scouts went back home . An excited council of war must have followed , for in a few minutes there issued from the old nest an imposing array of warriors , marching in ranks as orderly and well defined as the Macedonian phalanx . A few scattered ants running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could serve as fortifications in case " earthworks " were needed for defense . Then the whole band , now greatly augmented , swarmed across the bridge . A lone ant of the new colony was out taking the air when he saw the hostile band come pouring toward him . He was A member of the old colony got curious . He sneaked across the bridge and penetrated into the new nest of ants . He never came back . That meant war , the old ants decided . But they did not lose their heads and dash pell-mell across the bridge , only to be swallowed up in a possible ambush . Instead , they chose 10 of their best warriors and sent them out as scouts . These daring ants crawled across the chip of wood , with the muddy water of the moat menacing them from below , and crept cautiously into the enemy 's territory . brave , but he also was wise . Therefore he hurried back to the nest to warn the others . In a few seconds all his co rades were streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific . It sounds almost unbelievable , but the fight lasted for four days and nights On one occasion an armistice was arranged but it lasted only a few hours . Evidently the terms were broken by one side or the  | ether , for the battle was resumed , and more wounded lay quivering on the white sand or floating helplessly in the water beneath the bridge , while dead bodies lay strewn around everywhere . With their big mandibles , the warriors slashed at one another in individual corneat . They tossed the weaker ones into the moat ; or , failing this , cut off their opponents limbs and left them helpless . BY THURSDAY afternoon the invaders from the old colony had been driven back across their bridge and practically annihilated . Their fortifications were useless , for the rout was complete . The new ants took some of their captives for slaves , killed the rest , and then went back home . The workers cleared the dead from t. e field , and all was peace . The intelligence and power of organization shown by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of peace . This rnazing little animal not only is an e.ficient warrior ; he is also an architect , a mathematician , a perfect nursemaid , a professional strong man , a farmer , a doctor , and an undertaker of distinction . He displays teamwork and a force of will , equaled only by his fondness for gay life ( including , alas ! intoxication ) and sports . Doctor Hermann Eidmann , famous entomologist , of Munich , Germany , assures us , too , that the ant can talk ! Consider , first , his skill as an architect . In East Africa may be found tall , slim towers of earth built up by the white ant , er termite . Some of these towers are 20 feet high . Imagine a creature only a quarter of an inch long constructing a piece of architecture 20 feet in height ! It s as if the ancient Egyptians had built 12 pyramids , one on top of the other . And the Egyptians at least had primitive tools , while the ant works with nothing except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania are found some of the largest " ant cities " in the world . Most of them are built under ground , and the biggest one covers 30 acres . Think of 30 acres of ants ! Think of the bewildering complexity of the subterranean passageways , and you will wonder how an ant ever finds his way back to his starting-place . Yet he does , by some mysterious sense of direction . The ant is the most efficient builder in the world , for he carries all his " tools " and material with him . For instance , he can make a sort of millboard for his home by chewing up certain vegetable matter and causing it to stick together by means of a glue secreted in his glands . Perhaps the most striking demonstration of the ant 's intelligence is afforded by the manner in which he builds a shelter among the branches of a tree by " sewing ' ' leaves together . The fullgrown ant can spin no " thread , " but the larva can , for it has to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been spinning their silk cocoons . A number of worker ants pull the edge of deeper caverns ; another will seize a grain of sand and start to repair the nearest breach ; still another will carry away any debris that has fallen in the tunnels . And the most peculiar thing about it all is that apparently no one ant directs the work . There is no leader , no boss . Yet they work like a machine . This spirit of co-operation extends even to the fallen brothers , as exemplified in a rather laughable experiment once made by Sir John Lubbock . Sir John took a few unfortunates , made them drunk on hard liqucr , and put them on a highway where sober ants were hurrying back and fcrth . The sober ones were quite excited at this disgraceful spectacle , and probably somewhat scandalized , but they picked up the drunken ants and took care of them , nevertheless . To be truthful , one thing must be noted : Some of the drunken ants were strangers , and these the sober rescuers ducked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they took home to safety . One must discriminate , of course . Did you ever think of the ant as a mathematician ? Not that he delves into  | the intricacies of . higher calculus ; but he does seem to be able to count , and that is more than a lot of animals can do . For instance , Ormond Francis Williams , an ant expert of Bridgeport , Conn. , tells how on a walk in the woods one day , he kicked over a stone with his foot and uncovered numerous cocoons in which the pupae were developing . He picked up a couple with a small twig to investigate them . Meanwhile the excited ants below began to carry their treasures off to the nest . They took away all the pupa that remained on the ground . Then they , came back and looked around . They could see nothing more to get , but still they hunted . The ants evidently had counted the pups and knew there were just two missing , for when the latter were put on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the perfect nursemaid . As soon as the queen has laid her eggs , workers come scurrying to the spot . Each one seizes an egg in his mouth ? holding it very gently ? and carries it to a specially prepared chamber , warm and moist . Once there , they classify the eggs according to sizes , and when the larvae emerge , they are placed in a circle with their heads pointing away from the center , so that the nurses can hurry around the outside and give them nourishment . ' There is a species of ant in the tropical countries that takes its young outside on nice warm days , and parades them up and down , just like the **25;775;TOOLONG combination so common in the human race . The ant nursemaids are even more insistent on cleanliness than are the human species . They keep in the nest a sort of moist sponge made out of various soft materials , and whenever a young ant gets its mandibles all dirty or splashes mud on its antenna , the nurses hurry it to the sponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to make an ant unbosom himself and , speaking right out from the heart , tell us which of his various marvelous accomplishments makes him proudest , he would probably say , " My strength ! " and then laugh at us condescendingly . For the ant is such a wonderful all-round athlete for his size d weight that he makes the most powerful man on earth appear a weakling . Here is one of his lesser feats as described by the naturalist , A. D. Du Bois : An ant was observed carrying a pebble from the bottom to the top of a mound. - The ant and pebble were weighed , and the height of the mound was measured . For a , man to do an equivalent piece of ork in proportion to his size , he would . have to carry a trunk weighing half a t m up 25 flights of stairs . If that seems marvelous , consider this : A little field ant , in a carefully arranged laboratory test , held in his jaws a weight 100 times heavier than itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , e would have to be able to stand camly on the edge of some convenient  | precipice while eight freight cars loaded with iron dangled from a chain passed . over our lower jaw . A well-known entomologist has asserted that if any man weighing 150 pounds had the same strength in porportion to his weight as the ant has , he easily could hoist two of the largest modern locomotives on his back and walk away with them , without even staggering . There is a species of ant in Africa . called the " bulldog , " which Professor Wroughton tells us , can travel along in great leaps a foot long . If modern man wishes to emulate this achievement , he will have to increase the present broad jump record from slightly over 25 feet to 144 feet . The ant is a farmer . It may sound unbelievable , but he has his own gardens that he cultivates , and in which he raises special foods found nowhere else ; and he has " stables " wherein he keeps " cows , " which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants called the " leaf-cutters . " They slash off leaves from trees with their sharp mandibles , carry the leaves down into the nest , and there chew them up into a fine paste that they spread on the floor . Meanwhile other ants have been hunting mushroom slips , which they now carry in and plant in the prepared " soil . " The result is a fungous growth that seems to be one of the favorite ant foods . THE ant 's " cow " is the ' aphid , the green-fly of our gardens . The ant seizes these little creatures , takes them to the nest , and there shelters them and feeds them . In return for this , the aphids give off a honey-dew " milk " when stroked by , the ant 's antennae , and this honey-dew is the ultimate in beverages for the ant . Did you ever think of the ant as a surgeon ? He is , though his operations are rather ? heroic . Among the Brazilian leaf-cutters the following technic is employed : When a patient is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeons catch a few huge soldiers who wo n't be missed , and , holding the edges of the wound close together , induce a soldier to close its jaws in them . The unfortunate soldier then is decapitated . A number of these " stitches " are put in , according to the length of the wound , and they remain firmly locked and the wound is healed fully . One well may question whether the disease is worth the cure . Finally , we may note that the ant has that trait so extremely rare among animals ? he buries his dead in a cemetery , and with a regular funeral procession . Members of the colony lift the dead body with their mandibles , and , others following in solemn line , they go outside the nest to the little plot of ground where they bury their corpses . There is much more that this marvelous little creature , such a wonder-worker for his size , can do . In the roles in which we have considered him we have seen him versatile beyond all belief . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only he could talk , we can but guess .  |
