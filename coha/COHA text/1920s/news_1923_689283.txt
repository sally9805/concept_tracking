txt Mayor Dever says that he does not take any stock in the theory that it will be politically astrous for the party and administration which undertakes to build subways . Some politicians have been telling him that subways will ruin the persons responsible for them . The citizens of Chicago are spending about twice as much time on street cars as they ought to lie compelled to do . A street car trip is about the greatest known waste of time . It it is politically dangerous to cut that time In two , then it ought to be good politics to go back to horse cars . The idea that Mr. and Mrs. John Dearborn will be out sifter the scalp ' of any one who gives them a speedy subway- train in place of a slow surface car and enables them to extend the range of territory in which to live is consistent only with the idea that the town is loony . FREIGHT RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES . The head of the Carnegie institute at Pittsburgh told a gathering of New Jersey farmers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . nishings and other commodities would reduce prices 2 per cent this would reduce the farmer 's expenses as much as a 25 per cent reduction in freight rates , So Would a reduction of 1 per cent in interest on loans . The trouble with that proposition Is that the freight rates may be reduced  --  possibly  --  by political pressure ; commodities and interest not so readily . But that is a consideration the farmers will pen . der very carefully , if they look to the future . They may be able to force a reduction in freight rates by using their influence upon the machinery of regulation , but If that reduces the efficiency of transportation the immediate advantage will be wallowed up sooner or later , probably sooner . ' Regulation , unless it is constructive , Unlessiin the long run it builds up the railroads , is not in the farmer 's Interest . As his political leaders do not discuss that much , it is up to the farmer to look tt up for himself . Just freight rates should bo worked for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just to the farmer , though he may think It is until he begins to pay the price of inade ? k.quato service .
