txt Policy in- Park Management . To de Editor of The New York Times : Commissioner Gallatin is certainly right in his argument that the methods of administration of the Chicago parks would not be suited to Central Park , The conditions in the two cities are quite different . It is not the golf course , nor the gymnasium , nor the laundry that makes the South Parks such a success ( though they all help ) , but the fact that the park authorities have found out by long experience how to run their parks . The present deplorable condition of Central Park is not due to Commissioner Gallatin nor to any other . Commissioner , nor to any Mayor . It is due to the anomalous system of administration which , almost from top to bottom , is a question of political patronage . No executive could develop and carry out a sound policy of park management unless he could stay in office long enough to do so and had under him a complete staff chosen on merit , and with their jobs dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks in the world to run because of its peculiar conditions , its limited area and the great demands upon it . Yet the Commissioner is hampered all the time by lack of tradition , lack of time , funds , police protection and qualified assistants . As for keeping off the grass , Commissioner Gallatin is quite right . People insist that Central Park should be a scenic park , and ? you can not have such a park without grass . While grass will withstand a wonderful amount of wear and tear if properly made , maintained and protected at intervals , it will not survive the intensive use of many parts of Central Park all the time . One more point . I would be glad to suggest to Mr. Gallatin in reply to his question a method of adding 100 acres to Central Park . It would be by the removal of both reservoirs , which occupy a good deal more than that space in the heart of the Park . The reservoirs have served their indispensable purpose , but are now antiquated obstructions .

HAROLD A. CAPARN . New York , July 29 , 1992 . The City 's Pushcarts . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with some amusement , Mayor Hylan 's letter to Commissioner O'Malley , telling the Commissioner not to worry about what people think or say in regard- to this one-dollar-a-week tax on the pushcart peddlers , but the facts are there all the same , and every honest ' citizen knows that it is wrong and illegal to collect this tax . For a period of forty-two years I was connected with the De Witt Memorial Church . on Rivington Street . I have watched with alarm the rapidly increasing number of pushcarts . I have been told ? on good authority that in Rivington Street alone , from the Bowery east to Goerck Street , a distance of eighteen city blocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not defending the pushcart peddlers ; they are a nuisance , a menace , a disgrace and a reproach to our city . The majority of them are not citizens ; they are ignorant of American laws and believe that this is a free country , where every one can do as he pleases . They have no regard for churches , schools or public institutions or the rights of pedestrians to the sidewalks , the streets or the crossings . Our city officials , especially our present City Government , have been lax in enforcing the laws , while they are in dead earnest in collecting the dollar tax . MALCOLM R. BIRNIE . Monterey , Mass. , July 25 , 1922 . Improving the River Front . To the Editor of The New York Times : It has been my dream as a citizen of New York City to see our river front made more available for the poor .
