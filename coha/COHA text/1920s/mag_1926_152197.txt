Herewith are excerpts from letters come to the desks of the editors during the past week . They are selected primarily for the information they contain either supplementary to or corrective of news previously published in TIME . <P> <P> Chippers <P> Sirs : <P> The summaries of archaeological and paleontological activity that occasionally appear in your Science department entitled " Diggers " are fine-as far as they go . You report only an iota , however , of the vast amount of work that goes on in these extremely important fields constantly . How much better " Diggers " TIME , April 25 would be , for instance , if you had told about Halvor H. Skavlem , a 78-year-old Wisconsinian who has devoted many years of his life to studying Indian relics and is the only white man who has ever discovered and imitated the lost Indian method of chipping flint arrowheads with bits of bone and a crude hammer ! Recently he gave an exhibition here , chipping out perfect heads in 15 minutes each , with motions that looked so simple until one tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwaukee , Wis . <P> <P> While Chipper Skaylem 's abilities are surely not insignificant , Subscriber Peffers errs in believing Chipper Skavlem to be " the only white man " to have discovered and imitated the Indian manufacturing process . At least one other such white man exists-Chipper Joseph A. Barbieri of Pasadena , Cal. , who can reduce stone nodules to thin blades , strike a spall from a brittle nucleus , by freehand percussion . ( See Art and Archaeology , Vol . XXI , No. 2 , p. 68 ) . <P> <P> Miraculous <P> Sirs : There are those who , having attained " Oneness with Brahma , " would discover soup-stains on that one 's waistcoat ; who , sitting on a lotus flower in the selfless Nirvana of Buddha , would find withered petals ; who , wandering deified through the Greek Elysian Fields , would discover a fly in Hebe 's nectar ; or who , reading that perfect periodical TIME , would stumble over idiosyncrasies . <P> Blessed by the Pope , bidden adieu by Premier Mussolini as she sailed majestically forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) strokes of his pen , your Editor converts her the Norge from a " good airship " into a " BLUNT SILVERY CIGAR . " TIME , Apr. 19 , SCIENCE . <P> Miraculous as this may seem to us and dismaying to the Anti-Nicotine League , your Editor is not yet done . Nay , far from it . For as she sails high above the sparkling Mediterranean , he must needs bring despair to peace advocates and consternation to those whose business is armaments , by a transformation no less astonishing . This innocent airship , which left the Ciampino Airdrome with all its young ideals unbesmirched , and is dragged over the Appian Way where Emperors marched in triumph , as a vicious " BLUNT CIGAR , " he fiendishly converts into nothing less than a " LONG SILVER BULLET " ! <P> <P> SIDNEY F.
