Efficient as Democratic whip in the sessions of the House of Representatives , William A. Oldfield of Arkansas looked out from his Washington window upon the newsdealers and decided to bend the power of publicity to his purposes . Announcement : <P> " A number of prominent Democrats interested in the Party 's future and having especially in mind the Congressional elections of next year , have made possible the publication of a Democratic weekly newspaper from Washington . It is The National Democrat . <P> " Lack of adequate publicity has been the greatest handicap of the Democratic Party in state and national politics . Special privilege , fostered by the Republican Party , largely controls the press of the country . The Democratic Party is committed to the policy of ' equal rights to all ; special privileges to none . . . . ' <P> " A strong advisory board will direct the editorial policies of The National Democrat , and it should have a million readers before next year 's elections are held . " <P> Many Democratic editors failed to exhibit the expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden last July received their due of publicity . <P> And Republicans , unable to obtain exact count of the fugitive circulation of The National Republican which lived strenuously for several years as a weekly , lately changed to a monthly , diagnosed Representative Oldfield as having been infected with the bacillus optimisticus common to all circulation managers . <P> Mr. Oldfield 's real purpose is , of course , not to obtain circulation , but to create a dynamo . His dynamo is designed to generate high voltage of partisan pride among scattered Democratic editors who , in turn , will supply voltage to the voters . With a circuit working as efficiently as himself , Mr. Oldfield believes the Democratic Party will magnetize Congress in 1926 and the White House in 1928.
