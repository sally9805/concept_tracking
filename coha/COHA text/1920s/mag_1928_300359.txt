Chuckles were heard in tens of thousands of British homes when the famed London weekly Sketch arrived and was ruffled over to a peculiarly English full page cartoon in decorous pastel colors . <P> Depicted was a sophisticated bookshop into which an innocent , pink-cheeked old lady had blundered , on her Christmas shopping . The caption-irresistibly amusing to Britons , but puzzling to many a U. S. citizen-read : <P> WELL , WELL ! <P> Dear Old lady ( to assistant in a bookshop ) : " Have you got this Book on Loneliness by Mr. Wells ? " <P> Of course famed and lovable H. G. Wells has not written any " Book on Loneliness . " The jest went deeper than that . Its sly allusion-perfectly understood by almost every Briton , except innocent old ladies-was to a new and sensationally suppressed novel , The Well of Loneliness , by Miss Radclyffe Hall . <P> Miss Hall has depicted sympathetically the mutual loneliness of two women ; and told frankly how they appeased it in the classic fashion set by Ancient Grecian maidens on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sappho , universally esteemed by classicists as the greatest poetess who ever lived . To a London policeman or magistrate , however , the very words " Lesbianism " or " Sapphism " are unmentionable , vile . <P> Last week Miss Hall 's publishers-the old and distinguished firm of Jonathan Cape , Ltd. - appealed against suppression of The Well of Loneliness , before the Attorney General of Great Britain , Sir Thomas Inskip . National interest focused on the appeal because Miss Hall 's book had received the indorsement of a petition to the Attorney General signed by John Drinkwater , Hugh Walpole , John Middleton Murray , Lytton Strachey , Arnold Bennett . . . . <P> Apparently the prosecution had been able to find only one distinguished Man of Letters who thought that The Well of Loneliness should be suppressed-Rudyard Kipling . <P> After hearing the appeal , Sir Thomas Inskip ruled , in effect , that British police shall pounce upon , confiscate and destroy all unsold copies of The Well of Loneliness . Said Sir Thomas , hotly , to reporters : " I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ever written ! " <P> Authoress Radclyffe Hall has said : " I have studied abnormal psychology for 13 years , as a member of the Council for the Society for Psychical Research , and as a Fellow of the Royal Zoological Society . Those who read my book need not be told that there is nothing salacious in it , and that it is written very gravely and without offense . . . . When I speak of female inverts I do not mean perverts . . . . Many times the invert is a great artist , highly sensitive and intelligent . She would contribute much to society if she were not despised and abused . " <P> Throughout the U. S. , officials are permitting copies of The Well of Loneliness to be freely sold by Messrs . Covici-Friede of Manhattan .
