There are , according to the Hoover Economic Survey ( see p. 75 ) some 17 million U. S. citizens engaged in playing the Stock Market . Most of these investors are new , small , ignorant . They speculate to double their capital rather than invest to get a steady increase . They are motivated by faith . <P> Nor have they much chance of becoming intelligently informed . Financial literature is usually written for financiers only . A corporate announcement concerning the issue of 20 million dollars in 4% convertible debentures makes little sense to the simple soul who is merely looking for a good aero stock . Neither are the standard financial columns , vague in their statements , technical in their language , obscure in their significance , of much help to him . Thus the small investor is forced to select his stocks largely by the Blindfold Test . <P> Last week , however , the People 's Market was given the assistance of a financial daily written in the People 's Language . <P> Published by famed Bernarr Macfadden ( pink tabloid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - New York Daily Investment News - described itself as designed to " help the public understand Wall Street . " When the Investment News was first announced ( TIME , April 8 ) , many a scoffer wondered how Publisher Macfadden , previously more interested in short skirts than in short selling , in swimming pools rather than in stock pools , could successfully turn to the Facts of Finance from the Facts of Life . Yet well was the transition made . There is no sex in the Investment News . There are no cosmographs . It is a tabloid in size only . It sells for 10 cents per copy . <P> The greatest difference between Investment News and the more conservative financial papers is in the Macfadden publication 's willingness to give specific tips on specified stocks . Thus in one day 's issue , there was definite bull advice on International Business Machines ( headed for the 200 mark ) , on General Electric ( may split 4 for 1 ) , Baltimore &; Ohio ( earnings may be $15 a share this year ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear counsel on Public Service of New Jersey ( priced too high ) , American Power &; Light ( why buy stocks at their high ? ) , Wright Aero ( headed for lower levels soon ) and others , including general disapproval of coppers and oils . <P> In all that has been written about Publisher Macfadden , he has seldom been credited for his undeniable talent for discovering and reaching new publishing markets . There were physical culturists before him , but not many physical culturists who succeeded in getting the man on the street to read about physical culture . In his group of confessional periodicals , typified by True Stories , he has reached down into an obscure stratum of society and found more than two million men and women who previously read few . if any , magazines . His tabloid Graphic , though not first in its field , out-tabloided the other tabloids and found its own public among people who read newspapers only for thrills and will gladly dispense with the news if the thrills come fast enough . And now , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Publisher Macfadden who provides the People 's Stock Market paper .
