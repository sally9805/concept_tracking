// Reason and the ' Fight Image " THERE is a type of mental exercise much approved in the schools and colleges and on the public platform which might be called an exercise in bilateral opposition . It is the exercise in which one side is pitted against the other . The oppositional bilaterality may be represented in some such manner as this : Yes No True False Wise Foolish Our side Your side We win You lose It is a rattling good exercise for the development of competitive enthusiasm . It is thrilling to the participants and to the hearers . In each side ? whether among participants or hearers ? it awakens a vigoroussense of the will to win . It exhibits the same exciting duality as a boxing match , where the purpose is to knock out one 's opponent so effectively that there is no breath in him . This has been the highly approved form of intellectual combat in the schools and colleges for many years . It has been supposed to be wonderfully stimulating to the wits , and to develop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the power to see two sides to every question . There are a number of considerations , however , that give us pause . I suspect it needs no argument , really , to support the contention that these intellectual boxing matches do not develop in boys and girls ( nor in adults ) the power to look upon both sides of every question . That is a bit of pleasant rationalization with which we have long deceived . ourselves . When we are really frank with ourselves , we know that the tendency is rather the other way . The side that has chosen the affirmative eagerly and stubbornly refuses to give full credit to the arguments that may be made for the other side . To be sure , it will find out ahead of time what those arguments are likely to be ; but it will not meet them with , a freely considering , openly weighing mind . It will meet them , rather , as one meets foes . The arguments are there ? yes --  -- but just wait until , by hook or crook , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking , in other words , is forensic . There is a case to defend at all costs . And the outcome is never an adjustment , never an incorporation of the truth that is on both sides ; never a reciprocal elimination of error ; never the evolving of a conclusion that is neither the one side nor the other . It is either this side or that . Hence there is , in this exercise , nothing of that quality most precious in all social thinking ? the " will to rapprochement . " The second consideration that makes us pause is the suspicion that this forensic , bilateral view of truth is in reality a highly artificial , conventionalized view . It is a view which harks back to the days of feudal kings and war lords , and which still shows vigorous traces of itself in party government . It is a view which can have no kinship whatever with the later-developed scientific spirit . For , by the scientist , nature is not envisaged as an antagonist ; nor are the questions with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , is a problem ; and the intellectual activity in which he rejoices is the power to seek out all the diverse aspects of this problem , to see the probleM grow , to find certain guesses turn - into proven errors , to find others develop into verifiable f act . For the scientist , in short , all true thinking is an attendance upon and a working with a complex , evolving situation . It is a type of thinking in which the problem is never fully set at the beginning but grows as observation and experiment grow . The scientist , unlike the debater , never goes out by the selfsame door that in he went . He goes in exploring ; and he comes out laden with the fruits of , unexpected adventure . This means that the debate is an unreal or conventionalized leftover from all older , prescientific , militaristic civilization . Apparently , it has no proper place in a civilization dedicated to the careful , ramifying search for truth . It is a question , therefore , whether the debate ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public platforms ; for apparently it tends to breed precisely that bilateral tyPe of mind which is of least use and of most detriment to a social order based upon intelligent discussion and wise judgment . Fundamental to the social training of the mind should be the development of a vivid sense that there is nothing cut and dried about the problem of life , nothing to be settled once and forever by a decision pro or con . Life is a process , a growing process ; and clear thinking is nothing more nor less than effective activation in and through that process . For the static , mechanical , bilateral view , therefore , with its hard exclusions of affir illative and negative , and its pitiless knock-down blows ; with its one-sided loyalties and its inevitably closed minds ' we must , somehow , substitute the organismic view and the organismic method . For almost every problem we tackle . in life ? whether in the sciences or in industry , politics , domestic or business life ? is widely complex . It ramifies in all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The adjustment of one part changes the orientation of other parts . It is affected by factors that lie outsidi it ; and it , in turn , affects these . Moreover , no real probleln of life is ever the same at any two moments . It changes ' grows , becomes more amenable or less . What we need is not debate , but discussion . Debate is narrowing ; discussion is liberating . Debate is stationary ; discussion is evolve ing . Debate is purely antagonistic ; discussion is cooperative . Modern education is moving very rapidly in the en ' , operative direction . The older individualistic relation he " tween teacher ' and pupil , where the teacher asked the ques " tion and the pupil answered ? or failed to answer and livas marked zero ? is rapidly being discarded . The more ad ' vanced schools are realizing the value of having students do things in groups . This is the wider significance of the " project " method . In an elementary grade , let us say ' - the project is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken to a truck farm ; the children watch the vegetableds being gathered from the fields , loaded on to wagons , all carried to the station . They are then taken to the docks ' on what it feeds upon ? there is a glorious competition in cooperation. , Each helps himself by most effectively helping the whole group ; and each has the greatest pleasure in his own achievement precisely in the degree to which it gives the greatest pleasure to the group . Tins is what all our social life is groaning and travailing after . It is mental Symbiosis , and it is as far removed from the forensic debate as two war lords banging against each other in mighty rage are removed from the scientific investigators who are making our world a little more tolerable place in which to live . For what our social life needs is cleverness in the art of thinking together , evolving - workable judgments together . Where there is still no such art , or where such an art is only in embryo , we tend to look helplessly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the schools , to the infallible textbook . ( See- the penetrating discussion of this in Follet 's The New State ; and the almost complete absence of any sense of its importance in most of the classic treatises on political science . ) Our social and political America of the past generations has been chiefly under the governance of lawyers . The lawyer-ideal has ? therefore dominated ? r-in the schools , on the platform , in the legislative chambers , in political conflicts and of course in that scientifically most backward of our institutions , the court of law . Every boy , therefore , since he expected to become President , slept with an imagined Blackstone under his pillow and orated like an - advocate . But the new America is falling ? or rising ? into other hands . The lawyer , like the man of the cloth , is sliding down the nether side of the wave of public confidence . ( It is significant that a new type of laWyerthe adjustor and cooperator type ? as likewise , ' here and there , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new lords of life are the business man , the engineer and the scientist . These are men who have no use for debate . They are handlers of situations , seekers after causes and effects , investigators ; shapers of new ends and new means . ' hey are setting the new pace for a citizenry which is growing a bit wearied of the oM partisan futilities . The schools and colleges , therefore , and the pUblic platform would , apparently , be far more in line with the spirit of the day if they developed in their constituency the type of mind apt for the handling of many-sided , growing problems , the type of mind skilled , not in casuistry nor in bilateral antagonism but in the alert meeting of mind with mind to the end of cooperatively evolving , out of difficult , complex situations , the judgments necessary for sane and successful living . II Wisdom , as Dewey has repeatedly pointed out , is developed through reaction to specific situations . It is never born out of a vacuum . Such reactions to specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Education is in large measure an imaginative meeting of situations that in all probability one will later confront . Thus the boy or girl of twelve is imaginatively inducted into commercial enterprises , into transportation , into various citizenship activities , although years will pass before he will actually participate in these situations . Now the situations that education most largely uses are " fact " situations . " Citizens vote at the age of twenty-one ? they vote every four years for a governor of the state , etc . " The child imaginatively participates in this civic functioning by simply accepting the facts as facts and taking it for granted that when he grows to the requisite age , he will vote in the manner prescribed . There is another type of situation , however , of which education takes little account but of which later life is full . It is the " problematic " situation . Let me illustrate by a quotation from a recent publication , The Public Conscience : A Case Book in Ethics , by George Clarke Cox . ( Henry Holt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio Legislature providing that when an adult of sound mind has been fatally hurt , or is so ill that recovery is impossible , or is suffering extreme pain without hope of relief , his physician , if not a relative and if not interested in any way in the person 's estate , may ask his patient in the presence of three witnesses if he is ready to die . If the answer is in the affirmative , then three other physicians are to be summoned in consultation , and if they agree that the case is hopeless they are to make arrangements to put the person out of pain with as little discomfort as possible . The bill did not pass . The project was bitterly opposed by the Independent , which expressed surprise that Charles Eliot Norton should approve of anything so crude , cruel and barbarous . Here is a typical problematic situation . As each legislator faced it he was called upon to think throUgh all the bewildering pros and cons . That it was not a simple case of right or wrong , truth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that such intelligent persons as the editors of the Independent and Charles Eliot Norton could honestly differ . What made Norton and a minority of the legislators approve of the bill ? What made the editors of the Independent and the majority of the legislators oppose the bill ? What are the considerations of real weight that can be urged against it ? Now we might proceed , in the fashion of the traditional debate , and choose two sides ? affirmative and negative . he affirmative is to do everything in its power to persuade us that the bill is a good one ; the negative is to attempt to persuade us of exactly the opposite . It is obvious that the very essence of the situation would thereby be missed ? which is , that here is a many-sided question , the answer to which is at best problematic , a question to be decided only by all of us sincerely trying to get the best light on it we can . Suppose , however , instead of ranging two sides in debate , we throw the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group changes . The group is not now divided into two partisan camps , each vigorously trying to win victory for its side , and caring comparatively little for the truth of the matter . It is now a group cooperatively seeking for light . One member of the group may have started with a firm conviction that the bill was justifiable ; but as the discussion proceeds , that conviction begins to be shaken . Other members , starting with opposite convictions , may find their views being modified . In the end it may be decided that neither a decisive yes nor a decisive no is the answer . It may be decided that the end aimed at by the bill is a good one , but that the times are not yet ripe for its attainment . Or it may be decided that a modification of the bill is desirable . In either case , or in any case , the discussion will have been an evolving one . It will not have been required that // a position maintained at the beginning be ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not what happens in these problematic situations in actual life . In real life COO sistency is the virtue of fools ? and party politicians . wise man or woman comes to every truly problematic situa " tion with a tentative mind . The process of reaching a decision is one of weighing diverse considerations ? testing , rejecting this , accepting that , modifying the other . If the decision is reached individually , it is a process of inaef discussion . If it is reached by a group it is a process of group dicussion . Let inc take another interesting example from Coxs book : The following advertisement has appeared from time to time in many reputable papers : ' A genuine steel engraving of General Washington will be sent post , and to any address on receipt of twenty-five cents . engraving is perfectly made on first quality paper any is suitable for framing . Address . . . When the advertiser opened his first mail after the insertion of the above advertisement , he found that more than $8,000 had been sent in . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoel in return for their money . The advertiser on one occasion was indicted ' ( ) - fraudulent use of the mails . He was acquitted because his advertisement had not misrepresented the facts 01 any way . Did he misrepresent the facts ? The court decided 11 If there was not literal misrepresentation , was there o , , sci representation by subtle implication ? What account show a court of law take of subtle implications ? Were the Pe() ; ? plc who sent their twenty-five cent pieces fools in the l ' 5 instance ; and is it the function of courts ' to protect fools ' against their folly ? What effect would a decision for t1 , advertiser tend to have upon the spirit of business eote ' ; prise ? What effect would the opposite type of decisi ? tend to have upon gullibles ? Here again is a rattling good chance for discussion , st chance which would be utterly lost if the matter were C311 in the mold of a debate . For out of a discussion w ? 1-1 d grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general that would be even more le : uable than the mere right or wrong of the judge 's cision . The book from Which I have quoted is an epoch 1113killbg adventure in the field of public judgment . It , is eP ? cof making because it indicates a new method for the study 5 , social thinking . It presents cases , e. specific situatiof:e situations that are problematic . And it asks not that 1111 , decide pro or con on these cases , but that we consider weigh them in all their various aspects . It makes a P ? ? he in short , for the substitution of discussion for debate . Iflitt ' w book , to be sure , confines itself to cases that come itall the purview of law . These , of course , are only a 5114 , part of the situations with which we meet in life . The P ject suggests to us the further enterprise of collecting Prt ? 11c lematic cases from everyday life that may be used as it , basis of discussion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social and the intellectual superior ! " discussion over debate , it is not difficult to visualize a ri w type of public meeting for the consideration of org public questions . Instead of the announcement , WitilIo its flavor of partisan bellicosity , of a Debate bbetweent " intellectual giants " ( to which we go , for the most part , already convinced , and quite piepared to cheer for ' our Particular hero ) there is the announcement that on such and such an evening ten persons , say , or twelve , some men , some women , in various ways distinguished , will publicly discusi a given question . The question is not stated in such a way as at once to elicit a yes or a no . It is presented rather as a problem needing clarification . On the evening set , the ten participators , seated together : in full view of the audience ? and preferably remaining seated ? Will begin to discuss very much as they please and quite informally . There will be no indication of sides to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as to a maximum of time allowed any individual at any one time of speaking . Otherwise speakers will be permitted to speak as often as they wish or can get a chance . It is obvious that such a public performance will proceed in a manner and to an issue far different than is ever POssible in a debate . Each participant , no doubt , will try to be as brilliant as he or she can be . And why not ? But no participant will be " lined up " at the outset ; and it may easily turn out that the participant who keeps the inquiring mind , the continuously critical mind , is actually found to contribute far more than the participant who starts and ends with dogmatic assurance . Besides , the whole matter begins in uncertainty . No one yet knows how the lines are to be drawn . The discussion may take this direction or that . Hie problem and . the solution evolve as the discussion goes on ; and it may quite easily transpire that a speaker , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only necessary , but victoriously clarifying , to modify his point of view . It is obvious , too , that the mind of an audience following such a discussion is being trained in a far more vital and helpful way than by the old knock-down Debate . The audience begin in expectancy , uncertainty , in a ques , tioning frame of mind . As the discussion proceeds , they follow this line of reasoning and that . Since they have not come with any side to defend , they are free to " taste " the intrinsic values of the points made . They see a problem being progressively developed by joint endeavor . And - if , somehow , out of the discussion a conclusion they get the triumphant sense of participating in lectual victory cooperatively achieved . Here is a field for the development of individual and group judgment that has been almost entirely ' neglected in our educational system , both intra and extra scholastic . We have taught individuals how to line themselves up on one side or the other of a question and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we have scarcely touched even the borders of this other great enterprise of teaching individuals how to weigh problematic situa- ? ns . Nor have we , save in the rarest instances , taught ? roufis how to weigh situations cooperatively . What we have done , in short , has been , in the main , to build up a " fight image " of the life of reason . But the true type of reason is not a fight . It is an exploration . More than that it is , when most effective , a cooperative exploration . It is this image of " cooperative exploration " that we now need to build up in our boys and girls and In our adult citizenship . The Debate is intellectually and socially demoralizing . Its place Must be taken by a form of intellectual activity nearer to the realities and far more fertile for achievement . H. A. OVERSTREET .

The stuff that Pirandello handles is too deep and difficult to come off so perfectly as it does . One feels that with such deep stuff one should fumble a little .

And we think the one inevitable way of saying a thing does not really say the bottom of it ; which might be true enough , if only we do not decide that leaving it fuddled and unexpressed is a deep way of saying it . " But there , " I said to my friend , with loving antagonism , " you are playing the Anglo-Saxon on Pirandello .
