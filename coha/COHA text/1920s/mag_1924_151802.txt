According to report the British Government , as an unemployment palliative , sanctioned the construction of a tunnel under the English Channel ( known to the French as La Manche ) . For this sanction the French have waited almost since the days of Napoleon , but the English , fearing for their security , steadfastly refused to countenance the connecting link . <P> For some time a French company has been in existence ready to proceed with the work . Half the capital was supplied by the Chemin de Fer du Nord , a quarter by the Rothschilds , a quarter by French banks . <P> The project is to cost $156,000,000 , will take four and a half years to complete . The French will start from Marquise , near Calais ; the British from somewhere near Dover . It has been proposed to build a chamber in the centre , to be flooded by either side in case of trouble . It has also been planned to generate power for trains from France to England , and for those from England to France .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
