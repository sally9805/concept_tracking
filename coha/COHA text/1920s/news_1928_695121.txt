txt Since the citation by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad to show cause why it should not be ordered to dispose of its holding n Western Maryland Railway some holders of the latter - ompany 's common evidently have decided not to main-Ain their position during what promises to be a considerible period of uncertainty . It is believed that the B. &; 0 . Rill fight to retain its position in Western Maryland and not feed stock out through the market as did the Kansas City Southern with some of its Katy stock after it was similarly cited by the L C. C. But evidently the I. C. C. must have felt sure of its ground before issuing its order to the B. &; 0 . Therefore , traders and holders of Western Maryland common are beginning to reflect on what can be expected of the road operating as a separate property .

Cost was $22.79 a share , well below present market level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first preferred and 8,030 of second preferred , making a total of 311 , S39 shares or 60.4% of Western Maryland 's 771.671 shares of stock of all classes . Total cost to B. &; 0 . was ** The eery size of this amount would make it difficult to find a customer . Perhaps B. &; 0 . could distribute the common through the market and get out at cost but it could not get rid of its first and second preferreds in such a manner . Last year Western Maryland showed earnings of $3.32 a share on common as against $3.27 in 1926 , not consider : . ing the accumulations on its first preferred which will total 70% July 1 . Considering these accumulations as capitalized by issuance of more first preferred , earnings on common in 1927 would have about $1.60 and in 1926 $1.78 . First four months surplus this year was $265,208 belo ? ? rast year . The Break Based on Dow-Jones averages for 20 industrial and 20 railroad stocks , the close Monday showed that industrial averages were off 15.22 points from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low of the year . The railroad stocks seem to have suffered more severely than the industrials . The 20 railroad stocks showed a decline of 11.69 from the high of the year and were only 3.26 points above the low of the year . But the decline in industrials was more severe than indicated . due to the sensational gains in certain of the industrials included in the averages . All the gain stocks have made while brokers ' loans have increased something like 5750,000,000 have been wiped out , and some explaining will have to be done if there is not a severe contraction in that item this week . Heard in the Room First Trader  --  Are you doing anything in the market ? Second Trader  --  Not a thing . Stocks are now at a level where I am afraid to sell short for fear of a rally , and afraid to buy for fear they are going lower . When Bottom is Reached When bottom is reached , there will be the usual stampede , with sellers far in the majority ; but we wager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other big financiers will be there as usual . looking for bargains . The best time to buy stocks is when they are cheap and every one wants to sell . Men who have amassed millions through constructive effort know values , and are not interested when things are selling beyond intrinsic worth . They buy stocks as they would buy any other commodity , and always have credit with which to average in case the things they buy slump a little more . Patience has amassed many big fortunes . Some Bargains May Be Near Bargain day in certain stocks may be close at hand . but this is merely a guess . However , some stocks now may be selling below what they are actually worth on a basis of earning power and assets . But when a big break starts , buying even good stoats-a ' on margin is a risky operation . Some stocks now purchased outright are bound to make money for buyers in the long run . Gains made by some issues since the first of the year have been entirely wiped out and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . We note that the following stocks are either selling at the lowest prices reached in the current year or close to the lowest : Texas Gulf Sulphur , American Car &; Foundry , American Locomotive , United States Steel , Republic Steel , Colorado Fuel , Allis Chalmers , Atchison . Union Pacific , C. &; 0 . , Baldwin , Greene Cananea Copper . Liggett &; Myers . American Tobacco . Johns-Manville . National Biscuit . Northern Pacific , - Youngstown Sheet &; Tube and Bethlehem Steel . These are only a few of the stocks that are selling close to or at the year 's lows , but they arc sufficient to give one a good idea of the severity of the decline . In a market such as we have been having , the good go down with the bad . But the difference is that when the turn comes , many of the bad ones fail to come back with the good .
