International Mercantile Marine stockholders last week decided to exchange vain mementoes of a frustrated plan , for new shares that seemed to promise them actual dividends . The late J. P. Morgan organized I. M. M. 25 years ago , close to the time when he organized the U. S. Steel Corp . His ideal was to create great corporations that would lead their fields . In steel he succeeded : in shipping he failed . The overdue , unpaid dividends on I. M. M. preferred stock now amount to tidy millions . The common stock , under such circumstances , has of course earned nothing . <P> Last summer President Philip Albright Small Franklin sold the corporation 's White Star Line , getting about $36,500,000 ( TIME , May 17 , 1926 ) . That sum approximates the amount of bonds which I. M. M. has owed for years . But President Franklin , astute , did not pay off any bonds . He kept the millions ready to snap up at sacrifice sales , bonds or ships . He has bought overtly no ships during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> I. M. M. 's capital structure has been inflated in respect to present condition of shipping . The corporation has made money , but not enough to pay dividends on $51,725,000 preferred stock outstanding . Thought of dividends on the $49,871,800 common stock has caused investment salesmen to laugh . <P> Recently President Franklin calculated a capital re-organization-103,450 preferred , 616,993 common shares , all of no stated par value . Earnings would be fractioned off among such shares . Stockholders would trade in their old shares for them . That is what they last week voted to do with scarcely a dissenting voice .
