A report was issued by the League of Nations on railway conditions in Russia . The information is collected from reports of travellers and relief workers and the periodical reports emanating from the Soviet Government . The principal points of interest are : <P> The Government is now operating more line mileage than when it came into power . <P> The number of railway men employed on Jan. 1 , 1922 , exceeded the number employed in 1913 by 117,970 . <P> The present situation is causing the Government considerable anxiety . There has been a wild outcry against the high rates on the one hand , but on the other , especially as the railways are at present being run at a heavy loss , any attempt to reduce the rates would be disastrous , as there is almost complete absence of business that might otherwise be counted upon to take advantage of the decreased cost of transportation .
