On the brink of a quandary , the G.O.P. 's Committee on Arrangements met in Kansas City last week . Besides deciding where the Negro delegates were to be lodged and what " stunts " the parade should perform and how the convention hall should be decorated , they had a delicate question to answer . What Republican , they had to ask themselves , was best qualified to be Temporary Chairman in June ? The traditional , and the sole function of a Temporary Chairman is to make a keynote speech which shall put all factions in a happy frame of mind , inspire the country and prelude Victory . <P> Charles Evans Hughes had made the question harder by declining to keynote . In him the committee would have rejoiced . He had renounced candidacy . Toward all the candidates he had seemed equally impartial . He would have ennobled the occasion . But Mr. Hughes offered his work at the Pan-American Congress as his excuse for eschewing active service for a time . <P> To escape their dilemma the committee members passed the matter entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined mind the decision probably rested anyway . Mr. Butler chose , and the committee unanimously elected , Senator Simeon D. Fess of Ohio . <P> When the announcement was made , observers were at first shocked by what seemed the inadequacy of Senator Fess as a keynoter . To the casual-minded , he is just a bald , slightly weazened little man with a sapless voice , a sapless personality . He used to teach history at Ohio Northern University and the University of Chicago . He was President of Antioch College from 1907 to 1917 . He rustles about in the Senate like a professor in an examination room , reminding heated debaters of the Senate rules , whispering concise answers and directions to his colleagues in the cloakroom . To have such a man sound the party 's first clarion would be , thought one hasty commentator , " like having a clerk address the stockholders . " <P> Another school of thought interpreted the Fess appointment as a studied rebuff to Hooverism . The committee members who made the appointment were predominantly un-Hooverish , including New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky and David W. Mulvane of Kansas , besides Chairman Butler . Senator Fess had energetically abetted the anti-Hoover campaign of his dead Ohio colleague , Senator Willis . Now that Senator Willis was gone , the elevation of his oldtime professor and friend seemed more calculated than sentimental . <P> Again , Senator Fess has ever been a Coolidge man , a " Coolidge-anyway " man . Only once has he endeavored to dispel the impression that he is the Coolidge spokesman in the Senate , and he later confessed that that one endeavor was only a political charade . The object of the " Coolidge-anyway " movement has been to block Candidate Hoover with uninstructed delegates and its aim , according to pessimists , is another " hotel room " nomination . The choice of Keynoter Fess seemed like a peep through the hotel room keyhole.
