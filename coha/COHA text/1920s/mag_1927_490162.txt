TO wretched hordes , summer means nothing so much as an additional dose of the Long Island Railroad . We frequently have occasion to crawl down in the woodchuck hole somewhere below Thirty-third Street from which its trains depart . The approach seems absurdly gymnastic , the price we pay for a ticket seems high , the bulletin hoard listing stations seems incomplete and incoherent , the fierce , running battle required to get aboard seems intolerable , and the trip  --  frequently standing up  --  is definitely not recreational . We are fully aware that the Long Island ( luckless offspring of the Pennsylvania ) is the victim of circumstances , tunnels , and bookkeeping , but how much longer will the pain last ? SQUATTING Hindu-like beneath 1-3 a tree for fifteen minutes last Tuesday , we withdrew from the world and assumed the life contemplative , hopeful of seeing which way the wind is blowing . In a vision the end of Democracy became clear to us . We hastily reviewed the fall of self-rule in the movies and the appointment of a dictator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human endeavor and the creation of a czar for each of them . Then we realized that everywhere the snarl of bureaus , legislatures , diplomatic corps , congressional records , boards of directors and committees of the whole had thwarted life 's simple progression , and we saw the ultimate step the appointment of a general central czar , a dictator of dictators . We had a clear glimpse of this all-powerful man , but our attention was distracted by the twenty-four pushbutton system on his desk and the battery of telephones , and we can not now identify him . We are certain , however , that it was neither Will Hays nor Kenesaw Landis . For a while we believed it was Tex Rickard , but reflection convinces us that this can not be , since some one certainly would have insisted that the imperatnr take a civil service examination . A THEN Mr. Coolidge said he did ve not choose to run again it was the big moment in his career , the most sensational act of the years he has spent in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass the effeteness of this day has brought us . We recalled the effective LiRcoln attitude in great hours , the Jacksonian flourish . These men would never have committed an important announcement to paper and calmly passed it out on folded slips . It could n't have happened as late as two or three decades ago . Roosevelt would have written a statement of that length on the side of a barn with bullets from a six-shooter . W 1 see no excuse for withholding from our constituency , incidentally , the real reason why Mr. Coolidge has chosen not to run . Everyone knows that the President is riding on the high tide of popularity ; likewise we all know his proclivity to abide by American precedents and his ability as a taker of bulls by the horn . Hence , adding this knowledge to the authority of our special Dakota correspondent  --  whose word is usually as interesting as it is unreliable  --  we are able to announce that Mr. Coolidge is giving up of/ice for a movie contract to play Western parts . A BOLD robber being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on Ninth Avenue . As the rascal passed us , our impulse was to put out our foot and trip him up , in the name of the law . Apparently , however , we are too elfin to be wholly public-spirited . The very next instant the puffing policeman passed us ? and our impulse was exactly the same . Protection IT seems that in Hollywood there is one certain way to salvage reputations . A young married couple , of some distinction in the realm of the silver screen , got involved in an unpleasant little local scandal . The thing was spreading ; there was talk . The managers of the two stars held a conference at once and decided upon 10 AUGUST 13 , 1927 prompt action . Invitations were hastily issued for a lawn party and Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were persuaded to drop in . When these great figures arrived cameras were planted and shortly thereafter there appeared throughout the press of the world photographs of the imperilled couple standing side by side with the unimpeachable stars . Thus was the thing killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lese majesty . Allez ? op/ FRAULEIN THEA RASCHE , the lady aviator from Germany , turns out to be blonde , pretty , personable , and interesting enough to be deserving , perhaps , of our passing glance . Her father , they say , is a brewer , and wealthy . Her two brothers were killed in the war . She has been athletic all her life , took up motoring at an early age and wanted to fly as soon as she learned there were airplanes . She received her flying diploma in March , 1925 , at the age of twenty-five . Since then she has become one of the finest stunt flyers of Germany and has taken many prizes from the war aces . Most of her records have been made in her small scarlet plane , the Flamingo , which she brought with her on the Leviathan and which Commander Byrd has given parking room in his hangar at Curtiss Field . Fraulein Rasche designs her own flying clothes . These are practical . There is nothing mannish about her attire when she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Levine , after meeting her at Kottbus , unhesitatingly hopped into her plane and trusted her piloting to get him to Berlin . When a fatherly gentleman on the Leviathan , . who found her attractive , ran his hand through her bobbed hair , Fraulein Rasche plainly showed her disinclination to be viewed as a person of flap-perish spirit . As for her English , she says she learned it as a child , which may account for the fact that its frayed edges occasionally get in her way . Shortly after her arrival a promoter suddenly descended on her at the Biltmore and asked her to inspect a proposed landing field for airplanes on a skyscraper roof . She did n't understand what it was all about , but went along . She nodded prettily when , on the roof , the gentleman produced blueprints . The blueprints later turned out to be plans for a boiler room . The newspapers , however , printed the endorsement . A gentleman who said he was of the German Ambassador 's staff called up the editors and spoke harshly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . Off the Ship SOME time ago we recorded the fact that persons recently re turned from Europe were beset by bootleggers , who , representing themselves as stewards employed on the ship upon which the travellers arrived , offered to fill orders for " anything aboard . " The practice seems to have grown . Seven people told us last week that they had received telephone calls of this nature , one gentleman announcing that he had had five the morning following his docking . For the benefit of our readers , we report that a well-informed and reliable bootlegger advises us that these people are all fakes . It 's just a new selling wrinkle in the liquor industry , in which , he says , competition has become as keen as in any legitimate business field , On and On ONE of the semi-sensational things N-1 in the theatre world is a recent announcement which means that the " Abie 's Irish Rose " record for a continuous run , and the records of all other shows , are to be surpassed . It comes from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ladder , " and who , de-. termined that its message of reincarnation shall reach the world , has already stood a loss of well over half a million dollars on his offering . The company has abandoned Saturday performances for the summer , a very unusual procedure . It seems that , when the heat came , Mr. Davis " Now , Sugar , play nice . " our nurse . " called his actors together and asked them what they wanted to do during the hot spell . He would , he said , allow them to discuss their plans alone . He bowed himself from the room , saying he would await their pleasure . Knowing their Broadway , the actors , as a matter of course , agreed upon a cut in salary for the dull months . They spent half an hour deciding how much they would dock themselves and then called Mi . Davis . " I wo n't hear of it ! " emphatically declared the producer . " I simply expected you to decide how many performances you wanted to give this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at full pay They say Mr. Davis has talked of buying a theatre for the show  --  attendance at which is reported to have fallen as low as nineteen  --  and of instituting a home-buying-aid plan for his cast . Since his income from rubber properties is as much per week as the earnings of the average theatrical producer in a year , he is n't bothered about the cost . Crisis WE were called upon last week ? V to sympathize with a young man from the South recently brought by the National City Bank to its New York offices . The gentleman arrived in town with a wardrobe befitting a young banker and , after engaging rooms , took it all , with the exception of one baggy suit , to a neighborhood tailor shop for pressing . Calling there the next afternoon , upon the eve of beginning his new duties in the metropolis , he was confronted by a sign which read : " On Vacation . This store will he closed until August 19 . " After a disturbed night , he went to the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter to one of the vice-presidents . The latter allowed him two days ' leave to meet the emergency . Skyscraper Pilot LANS for skyscraper churches are PLAN being announced with such startling frequency these days that one is quite likely to lose sight , in the prospective sky line , of the pioneer among them . This , of course , is Broadway Temple , at Broadway and 173rd Street , the steeple of which , we are reliably informed , will be visible thirty-six miles out at sea on a clear day . While the others are still on paper this one is already started , and its completion depends now only on the success of Dr. Christian F. Reisner , its pastor , in raising a million dollars more , a task on which he is at present engaged . He is a go-getter in a frock coat , this Dr. Reisner , big , gray , forceful . He was born fifty-two years ago in Ed Howe 's Atchison , Kansas , and started his religious work at fifteen . Later he worked his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Denver . He came to New York seventeen years ago . His theory from the start was that the church should be made popular , and when he took charge of Grace Church , in 104th Street , he installed motion pictures , used the billboards , gave away roses on certain Sundays , and flooded the neighborhood with handbills announcing his sermons under such striking headlines as , " Sin Cure , " " Why Work ? " and " Snow in Summer . " When the war came along he resigned to help the Methodists raise $107,000,000 . That done , he became pastor of Chelsea Church , in 178th Street . It had a foundation , a wooden roof , a $50,000 debt , and eight regular members . Now it has a presentable edifice , is financially sound and has twelve hundred members . Dr. Reisner has for long had the idea of his skyscraper church . His plan was to make it self-supporting . Five years ago he raised money to purchase a site and two years ago he had enough money to start building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , two apartment houses have been erected and filled with satisfied tenants , who will help carry the church financially . Between these two buildings will rise the church itself with its swimming pool , gymnasium , et al . ? as soon as the million is raised . One of his greatest gifts , Dr. 4 r " Yon know , babies always love me . " DRIVE 12 AUGUST 13 , 19 27 Reisner says , is thinking up unusual things to do . These have included inviting such persons as Lillian Gish , Nicholas Murray Butler , and Mayor Walker to speak from his platform , and giving a luncheon to Sinclair Lewis after the publication of " Elmer Gantry . " He is n't at all angry at Mr. Lewis , who , he believes , merely has temporary hallucinations regarding preachers . The Sin of Adams NOT long since , in these columns , we recounted the story of the origin of ice-cream soda in Manhattan . We now feel it our duty to fix the responsibility for chewing gum on the Borough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the otherwise uneventful year of 1866 , we are told by the scion of one of the oldest and most reliable families of those parts , that the possibilities of chicle came to light . It appears that in June of that year the Mexican general , Santa Ana , having found it necessary to absent himself from his native land , put into Snug Harbor . He hobnobbed frequently with the islanders , and one of his acquaintances was a young photographer named Thomas Adams , an ambitious young gentleman and something of an experimenter . During one of his chats the general produced a lump of rubbery substance which he said was the gum of the zapote tree and which he liked to chew . He gave Adams a piece . The photographer saw possibilities in it . He believed that , with proper treatment , it could be made  --  of all things  --  a substitute for the rubber used in plates for false teeth . Adams is said to have experimented for weeks with this in mind . It was only after a final test , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table , that he tried the general 's plan . He picked up one of the pieces and absently put it in his mouth . He found that it did not dissolve and that crunching away at it was somehow diverting . Eventually he and his father , after obtaining additional chicle , set up a workroom in which they boiled the product , cooled it in water , cut it into long strips and packed it in boxes . These they peddled . The idea of sweetening it and flavoring it came later . Then they moved to Jersey City . It is said that gum was not well received at first . The makers , however , hit upon the idea of giving away chewing gum with candy and thus developed a taste for the product . Eventually they became a great corporation and sold out for millions . We hear that fifty million dollars ' worth of the stuff is produced annually now and that all the department stores in New York have squads of men detailed to scrape it off the floors every night . Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dutch Treat . Its members are " working gills " in the broader use of that term . Most of them are writers . They permit themselves the /uxury , however , of holding their weekly luncheons in a secluded room at the sumptuous Park Lane Hotel . Recently one of the members tilted her nose a little higher as she swept past the elegant doorman , to impress her guest , a young lady from the provinces . The full effect , however , came later , " I 'm afraid , " said the hostess , " it was n't very interesting today . " " But it was , " said the guest . " And I think your clubhouse is simply marvellous . " Saved A BANKER who lives in Twelfth Street employs as a handy man about his house an unprepossessing , squint-eyed man named Jake , born upstate . Last spring Jake asked that he be allowed to use the unpaved por-tion of the back yard to raise vegeta-bles , and , since his family was to be away for the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables was set out in neat rows shortly thereafter  --  peas , string beans , potatoes . The plants sprouted , grew for a while , and then most of them passed sadly away , largely as a result of the peckings of English sparrows . Last week the banker , who had been solicitous through it all , observed that but one living thing remained , a discouraged potato vine . He prepared to extend sympathy to Jake on the passing of this , his last . The next day he noted , however , that the situation had been met . Jake , apparently after mature and careful thought , had erected a scarecrow . Camera Man IN the somewhat less than wild recesses of a room in the Museum of Natural History , Martin Johnson , the photographic explorer , is encountering difficulties these days that he never had to face in the jungle . Mr. Johnson , recently returned from a four-year safari in British East Africa and Tanganyika , brought back 250,00 ( 1 feet of his camera recordings . With the editorial aid of Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mileage a film to he called " Simba , " which is Swahili for lion , just as " Chang " is something-orother for elephant . It must be no longer than eight thousand feet . Mr. Johnson , it seems , resents this limitation , and fights as though his life depended on the outcome , whenever a lion is threatened with deletion . He fights just as determinedly for zebras , we understand . Zebras , it seems , photograph as though they were designed by Cecil B. DeMille . There has been adventure and romance in the life of Mr. Johnson . He is now in his vigorous forties and has been trailing danger for twenty years . He was born in Independence , Kansas , and ran away from there at the age of fourteen . He shipped aboard a tramp steamer which landed and stranded him in the Thames . Loitering in WhitechapeI , he met a cockney who had been a companion of Jack London in the researches for " The People of the Abyss , " and from him received an alluring picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a newspaper telling of London 's preparations for the cruise of the Snack . He wrote to London and was engaged as the Snark 's cook . When the expedition ended in the South Seas Johnson went fa ' Talrit ; ( meaning " native " ) and lived the life of a beachcomber for a year on the remote island of Morea . In Papeete he met two camera men from the Paris office of Paths who had been commissioned to join " the great white fleet " which President Roosevelt sent gesturing around the world , but who had failed to connect because of Lack of credentials . They taught him the use of the camera , and since then he has had a career of his own  --  in the Solomons , Fiji , Paumotus , Malekula , Borneo and , more recently , East Africa . He is largely credited with having caused the wave of interest in the South Seas a few years ago . After much roving Mr. Johnson returned to Independence , a hero , and married the belle of the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field of adventure . Although they prefer the wilds , they have built a villa reminiscent of Garden City in the outpost town of Nairobi , and they now call Africa home . No Sale WE were more interested than alarmed when advised by a re searching gentleman after dinner the other night that , for all any of us know , an Indian may drop into Manhattan one of these days and tell us all to clear out , skyscrapers , subways , twentieth century civilization and all . Our informant has been delving deeply into the archives , and reports his final conviction that there is no documentary proof of the reputed sale of the island to the Dutch by the Indians for twenty-four dollars , and that in his opinion the Indians never intended to sell the land anyhow , but accepted the money as a mere peace offering ( or , as we say today , gravy ) . Mr. A. J. F. Van Laer , keeper of the archives at the University of the State of New York , at Albany , is inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thought that the deed had been found at The Hague forty years ago , but it turned out to he something else  --  some Van Rensselaer dickerings near Albany . All possible repositories for the document that can be thought of have now been searched and if it ever existed it is now apparently lost . The audience to which this situation was revealed was inclined to discount the danger . It was the consensus of opinion that if an aboriginal heir should appear with his credentials he would n't last two days in the present-day traffic .
