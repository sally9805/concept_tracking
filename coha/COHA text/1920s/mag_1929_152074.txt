Women of the U. S. who like to put a drop of Coty perfume behind their ears were all approval , last week , when gallant Perfumer-Publisher Francois Coty founded a new newspaper , The Evening Friend-of-the-People ( L'Ami du Peuple du Soir ) , and took up editorial cudgels in defense of the U. S. cinema industry , which sorely needs a champion in France . <P> Like Great Britain , Germany , Italy , Spain and many another European state , France has long had a system of restricting U. S. film imports . The reason is similar to that which caused Congress to put a tariff on French gowns and hats . Supreme and unrivaled in their own fields are Parisian modistes and Hollywood producers . As yet , however , Congress has not decreed that for every three gowns that a Parisienne sells in the U. S. , she must buy one U. S. gown and try to sell it in France . The uproar , the heaven-piercing cries for justice which would rise from Paris if the U. S. took such a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was last week on the point of imposing precisely similar conditions with respect to U. S. films shown in France . <P> Almost every Paris newspaper except those owned by Perfumer-Publisher Coty has been urging for months that a one-for-three quota be imposed , instead of the present one-for-seven arrangement which U. S. Cinema Tsar Will H. Hays secured on his famed visit to Paris ( TIME , May 14 ) , but which expires next September .
