txt I am requested to speak to girls on matters of personal hYgidive . Tho re quest , which comes frequently , this time is made by a worker in an office with nine other young women and nearly as nlany men . And th4 cora1 Plalna.nt shows no more mercy toward the neglected members of the other sex than those in her own . ? It 's never o pleasant topic , really . And because we have at our command today for the asking so much free infermation on bodily hygiene It seems it is the one topic that might reasonably be avoided in print . However , from the reports it is obvious that the simple business of bathing is not the universal practice it should be . And it is too bad that girls will spend their money on rouge , lipsticks , creams , and marcels to make themselves more attractive , yet repel because of their inattention to the greatest attractiveness of all , personal meticulousness . It is n't only infrequency of bathing and shampooing the hair that are complained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspiration . Perspiration odor may ensure even where there Is strict cleanliness and daily bathing , but where it occurs In conjunction with unbathed persons  --  well , the individual deserves the ostracism she is working for ... Even the odor of perspiration may be subdued and in time entirely eliminated by observance of the rules of health governitig its elimination . And in the meantime there are any number of good deodorants available at comparatively small price . It Is n't outside cleanliness alone that has to be tended in the interests of one 's social acceptance . Many of the unpleasant breath and body odors arise from no other cause than constipation . And surely no one in this day and age Is unfamiliar with some good remedy for the condition . ? 111 ? ? ? Even though one walked alone , worked alone , and lived alone , she would still owe it to herself to be an agreeable companion . But when one is forced into close confinement with other workers the debt to self is greater , since the offense Is so unpardonable.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
