Smiling faces , brawny forms in dinner coats were seen in the Della Robbia room of the Vanderbilt Hotel , Manhattan , where an All-American team met for the first time in the history of football . The team was picked , the players invited , the dinner given , by the New York Sun . Sports writers of other papers were surly ; they did not like to mention the Sun 's dinner for the Sun had stolen a march on them . The dinner and the Sun 's choice of players may become a football tradition , they knew , and moaned their vanished opportunity . Meanwhile Oberlander , Tully and Diehl of Dartmouth eleven ; Oosterbaan and Friedman of Michigan ; Sturhahn and Joss of Yale ; Weir of Nebraska , McMillan of Princeton , Tryon of Colgate , Grange of Illinois , ate and drank and were entertained by the antics of those procured to amuse them-certain talented ladies from Broadway night clubs and W. H. Edwards ( large Peter Pan of Princeton ) , who acted as toastmaster.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
