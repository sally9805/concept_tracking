In Manhattan , where tall buildings have begun to cause concern , the Broadway Association last week noted , on the basis of new surveys , that every story of a skyscraper brought 1,000 more people to a neighborhood . But land is so dear on Manhattan Island that buildings must be tall to earn enough income for expenses . Thus last week Irwin S. and Henry I. Chanin , constructors , announced that their new building at Lexington Ave . and 42nd St. would be 625 feet , 52 stories high . The location is as costly as land within the " Broadway district , " a strip of streets about 200 blocks long where the value of real estate , as estimated by the Broadway Association , totals $2,741,115,600.
