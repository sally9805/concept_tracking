txt Philip Siegel , 21 years old , was arrested yesterday on the charge of trying to extort 00,000 from Edward W. Browning , real estate broker , who advertised recently his desire to adopt a girl child . In three letters to the wealthy broker Siegel threatened death to Mr. Browning and to Dorothy Sunshine Browning , adopted several years ago , if the demands of " the Gang of Fifty " ? apparently a mythical body were not complied with . Down at Police Headquarters , with Mayor Hylan and Police Commissioner Enright listening , young Siegel admitted the charge . He disclosed that a sudden yielding to the temptation of what he thought would be " easy money " caused him to attempt the extortion . After the arrest and confession , Mr. Browning refused to discuss the matter . He said he would issue a complete explanation which he thought would provide " a big story " at 9 A. M. tomorrow at his office . " I pledged - myself not to speak , " he explained , " as there . are big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at public school had been excellent .

In the pressroom of Tat NEW YORK Tuns , where he had been employed for four and a half years as a " fly boy , " one of the boys who carry the Printed newspapers from the press to conveyors for delivery , he was regarded as hardworking and honest . He went to a show one night a week , his friends say , and his only dissipation was an occasional motorcycle ride . He was even characterized as seeming to lack imagination , to be free of sensational fancies . He did his work and went home , and his only interest seemed to be working out cross-word puzzles .

Stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenements into luxury as a companion to Dorothy Sunshine stirred his imagination . He thought about it rather a lot . The romance of it , the power that could whisk a little girl from nothing to everything . the power of money gripped him . The more he thought of it the livelier became his imagination and out of it came a plot . On the morning of July 9 when Mr. Browning and his staff began to open the mail in his office at 155 West Seventy-second Street , there came the first communication from the " Leader of the Gang of Fifty . " Publicity given to the real estate broker 's desire to adopt a girl was causing letters to flow into the office at the rate of hundreds a day . The letters told of little Jane , so sweet , or sang a mother 's praise of little Mabel . Not so the letter from the " Leader of the Gang of Fifty .

Coughlin to launch an investigation . Detectives Sullivan , Collins and were assigned to endeavor to trace the typewritten letter . Sullivan was assigned to protect the real estate broker as well . Mr. Browning said he believed it would be wise to Insert the suggested advertisement , but the detectives per- ! waded him to withhold that while they went ahead with their search for the writer . On July 14. however , he inserted the following advertisement : BAND ( Cousin ) ? Will grant your wishes ; send instructions . Edward W. B. The second letter arrived at his office on July 15 . In it , according to Inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a threat to shoot Mr. Browning and kill his adopted child . Mr. Browning did not advertise , but the detectives redoubled their efforts . Yesterday morning a third missive reached Mr. Browning . In this the writer said that the " gang " was willing to negotiate , and that it ? had decided to send " a representative " to meet Mr. Browning at Central Park West and Eighty-sixth Street . The representative would be there some time after G A. M. , said the letter . Siegel usually reached his home at about that hour . after his night 's work in the pressroom . Upon the advice of Inspector Coughlin , Mr. Browning provided himself with a small black leather bag . Some paper was cut into strips and made into packages the size of banknotes . A $5 note was wrapped about each package . Bag in hand , Mr. Browning was at the appointed place at 6 A. M. At several points in the streets and within sight of the corner detectives waited in automobiles . Others peered from doorways .

" Yes , " was the reply as the bag changed hands . " All right , " said Siegel , " say nothing about this and it will be all 0 . K. " He then turned north and walked up to Ninety-sixth Street- The band of detectives followed . Siegel headed through Ninety-sixth Street and when he reached Broadway went down to toe downtown subway platform . The trailing detectives said he seemed to be nervous . After pacing up and down the platform he went over to the uptown platform . He permitted two trains CO pass . He was about to return to the other platform , when the detectives closed in and arrested him . He was taken directly to Police Headquarters and when Mr. Browning telephoned to the City Hall the Mayor came up and joined Commissioner Enright , as Inspector Coughlin questioned the young man . Siegel at first denied all knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write sentences out of the missives and then compared the writing he broke down and , they say , confessed . While this was in progress detectives went to Siegel address in East 117th Street . They found he had a room there with a family named Weingarten , old neighbors and friends of his parents . The police searched there for a revolver , but found no weapon of any kind . They took away a sample of writing paper . Members of the Weingarten family vigorously defy nded young Siegel . It developed that Segel went to ' live with the old neighbors about two years ago . At that time he became engaged to a girl liv , ng at 1.799 Lexington Avenue . His mother opposed the match and he left home . He has been visiting his family , however , several times a week since then . Mother Defends Him . " I ca n't understand this at all .

He did not gamble and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , since both he and the young girl he was engaged to have been putting away a little something every week since their engagement In addition , if it was money he wanted , he could have married two years ago . The father of the girl . who recently received $10,000 in damages after an automobile accident , offered to establish him in business for himself . " He refused , however , saying that as long as he had a good job he would not take ' charity ' from anybody . He has been a good boy , from his days in school right down to now . He was not given to reading wild stories of crime . In fact , he was n't much of a reader , beyond working out cross-word puzzles . I never heard him mention the name of Browning and he did not belong to any group of young men , since most men work in the day time , while Phillie worked during the hours when other men would be free and about the streets . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone . That 's what I do n't know . I am sure he did n't think this up himself ; he was not given to thinking about such things . " Siegel was lodged last night in the detention pen at the West Thirtieth Street Station . He will be arraigned tomorrow in West Side Court .
