Sixteen candles , divided eight and eight in two towering candelabras , flanked , on the stage of Aeolian Hall , Manhattan , the sleek black bulk of a pianoforte . An audience waited , marveling , expectant . The stage grew dark . An attendant appeared , tiptoed to the candelabras , lit each candle in turn with a glimmering taper . Scarce breathed the audience now , so grave , so holy , was the sight . A young woman in a rose-colored frock suddenly detached herself from the gloom , stood bowing in the soft-lustre before her instrument . She was Marie Leschetizky , final wife of the late Theodor Leschetizky , famed Viennese music teacher , * about to make her Manhattan debut . After due trouble with her chair , she addressed herself to a highly uneventful performance of a Bach Sicilienne . Bach , Liszt , Chopin , Debussy followed ; in all of whose works Mme. Leschetizky strove courageously to support the improbable theory that the Kingdom of Heaven can be taken by storm . <P> <P> * Theodore Leschetizky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-time pupils are Paderewski , Hambourg , Gabrilowitsch , Moiseiwitch , Brailowsky , Essipov , Friedman , Leginska.
