STACY-Alexander Black - Bobbs-Merrill ( $2.00 ) . The walls were not very thick where Stacy lived . Upstairs lived a female person whom he could hear walking , thud , thud , like a shod horse , endlessly to and fro , putting away her laundry out of a package -a year 's wash , perhaps . Downstairs in the basement there were two other people-a man named Barrack and a girl he had taken in . This girl had been on the town , but she was pretty . Stacy fell in love with her , fell also for the shod horse abovestairs . He knew his oats , he knew the big-town song-and-dance , the Broadway poker-game ; but love was a word he believed in . He put a wallop in that word , but was leery of saying so in gabfests , because most " gogetters " thought it was hokum , and he was a go-getter . " Big money " was what he wanted . He got a job promoting Sawkin 's Hair Salvation , gave it up , started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , always he was lonely , always there were the women . Mr. Black must have known a lot of Stacys ; he makes this one significant because he is almost perfectly average . If too many klaxons blow in this book , if people seem to skid into each other 's lives , trip each other up , like passengers at a slippery crossing , it is because the life Mr. Black has chosen to observe is like that ; people are hatched too fast , buildings rise too quickly , traffic is hard to handle , walls are not very thick .
