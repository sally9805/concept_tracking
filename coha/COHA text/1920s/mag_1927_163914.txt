New York State , not wishing to have a gun-toting Herrin ( Ill. ) within its boundaries , decided to tighten its criminal laws last year . The result was a batch of legislation , known as the Baumes laws , which went into effect in July , which increase the penalties on various types of crimes . The most important provision is that which sentences a man to life imprisonment upon his fourth or subsequent conviction for a minor felony . This particular statute has been the subject of heated legal debate and was " finally upheld by the New York Supreme Court last month . No doubt , it has made habitual criminals think twice before committing that fourth felony . Crime was reduced in New York in 1926 for this and other reasons ( migration of thugs , more alert police forces , etc . ) . <P> While others asked the opinions of public officials on the Baumes laws , a feminine newsgatherer last week sought out her literary idol , Theodore Dreiser , the plodding individualist , whose trips to Sing Sing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Tragedy ( TIME , Jan. 25 , 1926 ) . He told her this : <P> " The question is whether or not the Baumes laws do anything for society on the whole . I think they do . ... <P> " You see , there are just two kinds of people in this world . One kind believes in organized life , in rules , in property ; the other kind does n't . I know a man who decided at 35 that he could n't see the sense of belonging to orderly society . . . . When he had to steal for food , he stole . He was an extreme case , of course , but interesting to a man like me . . . . <P> " Now these Baumes laws-they came to be necessary because too many of the people on the other side of the human , fence began to run wild on our side of the human fence . . . . Remember that I think these Baumes laws , or any other of the type are just lazy . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember the filth and dirt in which these men live . . . . account what it is that makes some people get on the wrong side of the human fence . <P> " I realize it . I remember very vividly just how it feels to be hungry , damnably hungry , and not warm , and wondering where to sleep . Once you 've had that , you can never afterward forget that somehow or other this society has a responsibility to its weak people who ca n't make peace with it enough to get on . Once you 've been scorched-oh , well , I sound like a socialist . " <P> Mr. Dreiser , long famed and poor , is now famed and comfortably housed .
