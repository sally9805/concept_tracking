txt Excuse dent of the Board of but Not Elections , in explains Reason . ing his determination to prevent the introduction of voting machines . in spite of the reminder of the law recently given to him by Attorney General OTTINGER. is quoted as saying that none of these machines is without defects , and that never will he consent to the use of one unless " it gives to the voter an ocular demonstration that his vote has been recorded . " It no doubt is true of voting machines as of everything else of human construction that none has attained perfection and that in all of them exists the possibility of getting out of order . Voting machines , however , have been used for years . Their failures have been few  --  so few that everywhere their merits and advantages as a means of getting accurately and promptly the results of a vote have been held a sufficient reason for not going back to the old system of pencil-marked ballots . There would be little or no mechanical difficulty in constructing a machine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. VOORHIS deems so desirable , but it would add considerably to the already sufficient complexity of the mechanism , end , worse still , it would facilitate to an appreciableagree the discovery by other interested persons  --  those who had paid him , for instance  --  of how the voter carried out any contract or promise he had made . And what demonstration , ocular or other , has the voter , after his marked paper ballot has been put fit the box , that some hours later , when he is far away , it will be read correctly and counted honestly ? It usually Is , presumably , but the voter is at least as sure in the one case as in the other that his vote goes to the causes . or the men whom he favors . There is no question that the opportunities for cheating , if anybody wants to utilize them , are greater and more numerous with the paper ballot than with the dial readings , taken by . the several party inspectors the moment the polls close . Professor E Z R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette College , conof Living . tributes to the current issue of The New Republic an article in the course of which he applies to ants , grass ; and finally to men , a " law " which needs not a little consideration before it can be accepted in all Its implications . It deals -. with the capacity of any given district or region to support life of any sort . This problem has often been discussed , and it long has been recognized that the Population which a country can support depends on more than its natural fertility and its resources of minerals and the like . When Germany changed from largely agricultural to largely industrial , her population could increase largely and still live as well as before , or better . England . too , long since ceased to fees more than a fraction of her people from her own soil , but they did not go hungry because of that . Professor BOWEN demands that importance be ascribed to another factor as determining the size of population , and this is his " law " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies directly with the amelioration of the conditions of existence , and Inversely with the level of the prevailing standard of living . That is neatly expressed- and is more than plausible . China , with a population in large part composed of families content , or at any rate able and willing , to live for a year on $100 , obviously can support a far larger population than could the same area inhabited by people who consider something like $1,700 a Year essential to tolerable existence . So a high standard of living does tend to restrict population , just as does a growing Inadequacy of the food supply . But the standard of living is dependent on more than a desire for better and finer things ; It also is dependent on the possibility of meeting larger demands for comfort and luxuries , and the reasoning is therefore more or less circular . But any country can support more inhabitants who are content to walk or ride in trolley cars than it can of those who insist on having their private automobiles . One of the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that never . Opinionhas he drawn down on of himself as much of indignant protest  --  he calls it " calumny " ? as he did recently When he wrote that Noalust Mouauks 's ' : Boutb , waa dull . He repeated his offense in the eyes of these adverse critics by saying that " this is all the more extraordinary because the book is not . " He is paying the penalty which book reviewers so often invite by writing that a book is this , that or the other thing , good or bad , instead of writing that such is their personal opinion . As for " South Wind , " to some readers it seems a really remarkable book , full of delightful humor and abounding in characters unusual but plausible enough for belief . Others get little or nothing from it of this . Strangely enough , this diversity exists , not as between people obviously unlike in appreciation of literature , but among those whose tastes run in most cases together or Parallel . That conduces , of course , to controversy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each group is almoSt forced to scorn the judgment of the other . There are no available statistics to show the relative number of admirers of " South Wind " and of its depreciators , but apparently those whom its wit does not amuse and whom its cynicism offends or wearies outnumber those for whom the book is delightful frohi beginning to end . Those displeased by it can say that though it has been out for several years , it has not been , and shows no signs of becoming , a " best seller . " But will they dare to use that argument against it ? None could be more dangerous . Who was it that They Do n't told Judge OMMEN - Go So that to be able to go . Fast Very ruthlessly and ineon-Ver siderately throusi , the city streets , wherever one wants to go , it is only needful to take a taxicab ? if ever he has used those vehicles , he must have found out that during most hours of the day , and in most parts of the city , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are subject to long and irritating delays at many points . That the taxi drivers put on speed when they can , and occasionally show lack of consideration forthe rights and lives of people on foot , is undeniable ; but it hardly is fair or judicial to make like charges against the 10 per cent , of New Yorkers who , according to Judge OMMEN , are alone In using cabs .
