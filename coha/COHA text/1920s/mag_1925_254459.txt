ARMY &; NAVY <P> After the dull weeks of winter , the U.S. Navy went forth on its spring maneuvers . <P> The Pacific Fleet , known as the Black Fleet , under Admiral S. S. Robison , composed of 51 vessels , including most of the heavier and more modern battleships , was to simulate an enemy coming , in from mid-Pacific to establish a base on the coast of Lower California . The Atlantic Fleet , known as the Blue Fleet , under Vice-Admiral Josiah S. McKean , composed of 58 vessels , including only a few battleships , but with seven of the fast scout cruisers recently added to the fleet and with three new S type cruising submarines , was to advance up the coast from the Canal to prevent the Black Fleet from making its base . The Blue Fleet was supposed to know the time when the Black Fleet had started and its greatest speed . <P> Admiral Coontz in his flagship , the cruiser Seattle , was on hand as umpire . <P> The Black Fleet in close formation , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded behind , steamed toward the coast . <P> The Blue Fleet had its feelers spread far out . The cruisers sped ahead , seeking everywhere to touch the enemy . Following this , came another widespread scouting line of destroyers , followed by the submarines and last by the battleships . Every nerve of the Blue Fleet was straining , straining for a single contact that would tell the tale of where the Black Fleet was coming onward . <P> All through the day and afternoon such was the situation ; but , long before the enemy was sighted , the first part of the battle had taken place . The Black Fleet listened to the radio signals of the Blue ships- the code was taken down and , after a time , experts deciphered it . Straightway , the Black Fleet sent out false signals in the deciphered code , and misled numbers of the scattered Blues . <P> Sunset came , dusk came , darkness came . The moon rose over the waters of the Pacific , where the scattered cruisers and destroyers of the Blue Fleet plowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet . But the Black Fleet had eluded them . It was nine in the evening when the first contact was made . The cruisers had gone too far afield . So had the defending destroyers . The three fleet submarines of the Blue defenders sighted the approaching fleet , however , and made for their position in its path . Suddenly , the vanguard of destroyers of the Black Fleet gave the alarm . <P> Meanwhile , the scattered Blues learned also of the contact . The Blue destroyers hurried to position and a dog fight developed between the destroyers of the two fleets . The Blue cruisers , speeding in , came upon the Black Fleet from the rear . The battle raged . <P> The result will be known when the observers , umpires and commanders have consulted and decided . Two things were remarked at once , however : 1 ) That there were not enough scout cruisers to undertake efficiently the task of finding the enemy ; 2 ) that the new fleet submarines were effective , far exceeding expectations . <P> Following the moonlit battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Magdelena Bay and came to anchor at San Diego and Coronado Roads- 114 craft , including the airplane carrier Langley and the supply ships . Fourteen gorgeous admirals took part in the quarterdeck receptions.
