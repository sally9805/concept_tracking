S AMUEL GOMPERS was sufficiently great to encompass and express an era in American labor . For over forty years , even toward his end , he voiced the hopes and fears , the reforms and the bigotries of the craft phase of the movement he headed . It is a short view which considers him merely the conservative chieftain of a machine oligarchy ; he was a movement embodied in one man . From the mildest to the most rabid dissenter , all knew that he was the head of the organized expression of labor . And they all acted on the slogan , Get Gompers and Labor Is Yours . His personal history is not merely the story of his own successes , but of his opponents ' failures . One can get a more significant picture of his rivals ? Powderly , Debs , De Leon , and Foster  --  by learning all about Gompers than by knowing all about them . Gompers 's orthodoxy was distinguished by two main traits , probably reducible to one : his naive self-righteousness and his chronic pugnacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frey or Perkins or others of his associates . When he ventured into philosophical speculations about labor he was sophomoric . The absurd backwardness of his jealous craft separatism , forever entangled in fratricidal " jurisdictional disputes " while industry was rapidly amalgamating , was only too obvious . In fact , his intra-labor tactics , by which he maintained his machine and his power , were always directed against those sufficiently thoughtful to have a philosophy of labor as against his own hand-to-mouth opportunism . He was so much of a realist in his long guerrilla campaign that any " ism " antagonized him . All his life he fought the " intellectuals " ? within and without the labor movement . He fought the anarchosocialists of the last century ; then the present socialist movement , as well as all partisans of independent political action by labor , no matter how mild . He fought the I. W . W. and all the rest of the syndicalist schools ; finally , of course , he fought the communists . Toward the end of his life this anti-intellectualist complex developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took an interest in labor otherwise than as " expert " in his hire . There is little doubt that since the war leadership has been passing to the New Unionists , who are accepting the essential structure of capitalist management , and are trying to work within it by developing a sort of trade-union capitalism . But even that proved too much for Gompers , in spite of his belief in the framework of capitalism . And he fought labor 's entry into finance , into business and managerial cooperation with capita , almost as bitterly as he fought the Reds . He was born to fight at close quarters  --  for more wages , fewer hours , better work rules ; through the weapon of the strike and the armistice of contract . Yet for his time and place Gompers was essentially right . The visionaries could not scout and strike effectively in the primitive battles of our industrial frontier . Before the war American labor could not be led by philosopher-kings because its culture was necessarily simple . Gompers was king , but he was no philosopher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncannily shrewd and so vastly experienced . As sheer fighter Gompers was unequaled not merely in the history of American labor but in the history of the entire republic . His tactics were perfect . One by one he outwitted opponents , chasing them off the labor field and leaving them stranded in the desert to the Left of the mass movement . True fighter that he was , he never admitted to himself for a moment that he might be wrong . He had the fighter 's cold and merciless fury . Yet he had something in him which warned him when his enemies expressed a real , mass disaffection . When the craft movement became almost self-defeatingly " autonomous " and the radicals were howling for amalgamation , Gompers got the progressives to fight , successfully , for the industrial departments in the Federation . When , last summer , the rank-and-file cry for independent political action seemed too insistent , he " nonpartisanly " indorsed La Follette . Had La Follette won a strong congressional bloc , Gompers would have won with the winner . When La Follette lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He always fought with this **26;1787;TOOLONG shrewdness . Yet he always fought essentially incorruptibly ; what Royce called Loyalty to Loyalty Gompers gave to the labor movement as he saw it . Much has been said about his fanatical fire-eating in war time , which seemed to transcend his devotion to labor . This is only half true . There was much craftiness in his frenzy . He felt about trade unionism much as Lincoln felt about the Union . Anything to strengthen it ! Whether he actually strengthened it  --  is another question . A man of his blind self-righteousness and of such cunning alacrity could not stand the collaboration of strong characters . Unconsciously Gompers always surrounded himself with lesser men . And now that he is no more American labor faces the jealous interregnum of a coterie of feudal chiefs whose master is gone . Were it not for the growing circumstance that our labor movement is becoming too intricately and significantly a part of the national life such a period might prove fatal . But leadership is bound to drift increasingly to such men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without the American Federation of Labor . It takes little boldness to prophesy that the next half century will see all the tendencies against which Gompers fought with his splendid ferocity enacted into some sort of progressive labor philosophy . No sketch of the dead leader would be complete without mention of his fine human qualities . Some one said that " nothing human is alien to the Jew . " This certainly was true of Gompers . To those who worked with him or agreed with him or were in no way entangled in his tactics he was abidingly kind with that courtesy which the Germans so untranslatably call Herzensbildung . He really did have the rare magnetism of one who had the genius to synchronize his own personality with the fortunes of a cause . The obituary notices emphasize his rise from lowly beginnings , his terrible struggle with adversity , his death as a poor man . Of course Gompers was born in the indescribable squalor of Whitechapel and not in fashionable Mayfair . Of course he went to work at the age of ten . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarmaker in the daytime in order to support himself as President of the American Federation of Labor at night . Of course Gompers had these tremendous advantages . Else greatness could never have touched him as it did . League Ahoy ! E NGLAND has resoundingly slapped the League of Nations in the face and returned to a policy of impenitent imperialism  --  that is the meaning of the diplomatic antics at Rome . With a " Mind your own business , please , " she has turned her back squarely upon policies which Conservative , Liberal , and Labor ministers had developed and maintained . It was a Conservative Prime Minister who invented the " independent " kingdom of Egypt , and if the world still takes that word " independent " seriously surely no Conservative Englishman should complain . But the present attitude of the British Government , translated into simple English , is this : " We did n't mean it ; and if anybody outside of England acts upon the assumption that we did mean seriously what we said two years ago , we 'll knock his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirdar was assassinated England dispatched a note to the Powers warning them that her difficulties with Egypt were a private quarrel within the family , and that good manners required that neighbors should behave as if they did not hear the din . Since then she has gone a step further ; the Irish treaty must not ' be registered with the League , she says , because Ireland is also within the family , and the treaty is not properly to be called international . Just how this can be squared with England 's sponsorship of the Free State as an " independent " member of the League is not explained ; thus far , apparently , no other member of the League has dared raise the question . We may trust the Irish , however , not to let the issue pass . Meanwhile the League has received two other blows  --  the shelving of the so-called protocol , and the failure of the opium conferences . It took all of M. Briand 's persuasive powers in the League Council at Rome to induce the British to agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but merely required more prolonged study . Such forms deceive no one ; the protocol is dead . That in itself might not be so ill , were it not that with it go the radiant hopes of a new European spirit which seemed so bright in October . The protocol was essentially a program to enforce peace , by military means if necessary ; and The Nation has never believed that the path to peace is one of military power . The worst aspect of the present position is that the British newspapers contain plain hints that while England will draw back from any international agreement she might contract a special protective bond with France . The black days of secret understandings which brought on the European war are with us again . France and England have already agreed to give each other a free hand in their respective spheres in Africa  --  a development of the 1904 negotiations by which France dropped out of Egypt in return for a free hand in what has become known as French Morocco . Now France is to have Spanish Morocco , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own agreements with Egypt regarding the Sudan . The opium situation is as discouraging . The American delegates went to the League 's Geneva conference with a program of sweeping reforms , and in this program they were in general supported by the Asiatic delegates  --  the Persian , Turkish , Chinese , and Japanese  --  but opposed by the British and French , and by the gentlemen with suchfine Oriental names as Campbell and Clayton who appeared to " represent " India . As a result of this opposition by the Powers which prate most of the " white man 's burden " substantially nothing will be done . All this leaves the League in a position from which the half-expected announcement that the United States will participate in its Conference on the Control of Traffic in Arms next May will hardly rescue it . It stands flouted by the Great Powers which have , in the main , dominated it , and it has not dared to protest . That , some of its friends will say , is the fault of the United States which has refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fault of the construction of the League out of the victors in the Great War . One by one , as they lost their real independence and submitted to Allied control , the lesser " enemy nations " have been admitted . Germany and Soviet Russia remain outside , and Germany 's admission is planned only when , under the Dawes Plan , she has lost her freedom of action . A passionate desire for better things has at times animated the sessions of the Assembly of the League , but the Council , still dominated by France and England , has chilled every hope . Something is needed to shock the world out of the well-worn path which it is treading , and the League seems incapable of providing that shock . As It Will Be Soon CHARLOTTE , N. C. , December 8 . ? A trust fund totaling $40,000,000 was created here today by James B. Duke , tobacco and power capitalist , with which to finance and maintain a vast educational institution for North Carolina to be known as Duke University . If Trinity College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family many times , sees fit to change its name to Duke University , $6,000,000 will be spent in expanding it ; otherwise the proposed Duke University will be located elsewhere in the State . DURHAM , N. C. , December 9 . ? Trinity College will comply with the conditions upon which the donation of James B. Duke to the college is based and the trustees will do all in their power to cooperate with the philanthropist in carrying out his ideas. ? Press dispatches . C HICAGO , December 1 , 1930 . ? William Wrigley , the chewing-gum king , today announced that he had offered $75,000,000 to Northwestern University on condition that it change its name to Wrigley University and that of its medical school to Chicle College . EVANSTON , December 12 , 1930 . ? The president of Northwestern University today declared that its trustees would undoubtedly change its name as requested by William Wrigley . " The slightest wish of that great and good man who has done so much for the teeth , jaw muscles , and digestion of the American people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The name Chicle College especially appeals to me . I have often thought that our new-fledged doctors pay too little attention to the gastric juices . Thanks to this great philanthropy , Northwestern ? I mean Wrigley University  --  will now outshine any other in the Northwest . NEW YORK , April 1 , 1931 . ? Not to be outdone by William Wrigley , Harry F. Sinclair today announced that he was donating $80,000,000 par value of Sinclair Oil Company stocks and bonds to the University of Oklahoma upon condition that the city of Norman change its name to Sinclairia and the university to Sinclair . Otherwise Mr. Sinclair will make the same offer to Tulsa and start a new university there . He denied a later report that H. M. Doheny would make half the gift . " I am underwriting this whole deal myself , " he said , " and the university will have within it the finest oil laboratory the world has ever seen . The discoveries I confidently expect from that laboratory will enormously increase the oil reserves of the country and the profits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Albert B. Fall to the laboratory . " DETROIT , MICHIGAN , May 1 , 1936 . ? Henry Ford today announced that he had offered $250,000,000 to Harvard University upon the condition that it establish a laboratory for auto experimentation and change its name to Ford University . " I can not take it with me , " he said , " but I should like to have my name perpetuated after the last flivver has run out of gas . I have chosen Harvard because it shows the world the way to do it by making the business school the most important part of the university . " CAMBRIDGE , MASSACHUSETTS , May 7 , 1936 . ? When asked today what Harvard 's attitude toward the Ford offer of a quarter ' of a billion would be , President Lowell said : " I can not , of course , presume to speak for the overseers or the corporation , but I am sure that Mr. Ford 's offer will receive the immediate consideration of our governing bodies . We are very proud of the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served us well . It may be , however , that a compromise can be arrived at so that Harvard College could remain Harvard College within the new and greater Ford University . The medical school could be called Edsall College and the business school be rechristened the Dearborn School of Economics . I am particularly gratified that the greatest of our business men approves of our policy of making the science of business the foremost consideration of our university . " An American " Who Was Who " T HE need for a really competent dictionary of American biography is to be satisfied . The American Council of Learned Societies Devoted to Humanistic Studies appointed a committee two years ago to investigate the possibilities of such a reference-work , and when this committee reported recently upon the cost of the project there was consternation . But funds are forthcoming . The New York Times , through its publisher , Adolph S. Ochs , has offered $500,000 ? a sum sufficient to produce the manuscript of the dictionary if not to print it  --  and now a special committee of management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reside at Washington , where the Congressional Library offers , of course , the best facilities in the country for investigation , and it is expected that the first volume of the dictionary will be ready in four years . There will be twenty volumes , according to present plans , each containing about 750 pages and the whole presenting biographical information upon approximately 20,000 Americans , none of them living . The articles will be written either by specialists in the various subjects or by persons trained in biography and bibliography , so that a dozen years hence , when the dictionary is expected to be done , American scholars , journalists , and teachers will be in possession of a body of knowledge hitherto without parallel . The Nation , commenting in 1920 upon the news from England that the " Dictionary of National Biography , " recently given over from private hands to the University of Oxford , was in danger of neglect and even death , had occasion to regret the failure of most modern states to assume an interest , either through subsidy or through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Dictionary of National Biography , " which ideally should have been from the beginning an enterprise of the British Government , seemed a particularly flagrant one ; but it was pointed out that neither in England nor in the United States had adequate attention ever been paid to this kind of thing . In the present case , although Mr. Ochs and the Times are to be congratulated upon their enlightenment and their liberality , it seems regrettable again that the emergency which they met should ever have arisen . The new dictionary will be in every sense a national product ; scholars from all sections of the country will be asked to contribute , the work will be directed from Washington when it is not done there , and national ends will be served . What more logical then , than that the government pay the costs ? Without Mr. Ochs the book would have been left to chance , and chance has rather a rude way with learning . To be sure the attitude of governments is not too stable a thing , and there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the " Dictionary of American Biography . " A few years ago President Harding made the appalling remark that the only act of administrative economy he could think of at the moment was doing away with the Bureau of American Ethnology ! But it is unlikely that even a President would dare to hint that the dictionary was becoming too expensive  --  was costing almost as much as the Mayflower . The choice of an editor will be no easy task , for he should be a man neither too young to be soundly informed nor too old to need the reputation which the work will give him . Needless to say he should be interested in everything ; the council which appoints him represents societies not only of historians and students of literature but of philosophers , scientists , antiquarians , philologists , archaeologists , economists , sociologists , and political scientists . In particular it is to be hoped that he will not be satisfied merely with biographies which can be pieced together from documents already collected and catalogued in libraries . On this basis preachers celebrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother-politicians would get more than their share of space . Business men , about whom it is often difficult to find much satisfactory information after their death , should receive attention proportionate to their really great importance . Explorers , pioneers , and persons of all sorts influential along the various frontiers should be treated as fully and clearly as the materials will permit . The circuit-rider , the vagrant , and even the rogue should appear whenever distinction of some kind has been achieved . Perhaps it is not too fantastic to suggest that certain entirely mythical  --  yet nevertheless enormously influential  --  figures ought to be honored with sketches . The precise dates of Paul Bunyan might be hard to discover , but there is no denying that he has had a career ; and so have Pecos Bill , and Tony Beaver , and Strap Buckner . The only reason for ruling them out , and on second thought it seems an important one , is that they are still very much alive .               @ @ @ @ @ @
