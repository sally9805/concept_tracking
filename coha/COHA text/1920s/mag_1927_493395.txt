The Week THE conference on limitation of armaments which opened in Geneva this week is chiefly notable for the presence of Russia . For the first time , all the chief nations of the world have gathered around the council table to see whether they can not ! educe the burden of military expenditures , which , for some of them , constitutes such a crushing load . part of the obstacles which , in the past , have renclered success difficult have been cleared away . With the United States and Russia both present , it is no ' ? nger possible to put forward the excuse that any agreement achieved would be only a partial one . 411e difficulties which still remain are so great , howhundred that there is not more than one chance in a utilpdred that this conference will accomplish any-acing of importance . The nations are as suspicious One another , and as little inclined to put their trust in anything but the force of their own arms , bloat any time in the recent past . There is bad CPd between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia , Poland and Germany , eland and Russia , Rumania and Russia . Despite agreements made by their industrialists , France and u Germany remain at loggerheads over the Rhine occupation , the proposed uniting of Germany and Austria , and conflicting policies toward Russia and Poland . The League , while it has proved itself indispensable in minor and routine matters , is unable to cope with any serious dispute between major powers , which is invariably taken out of its hands and settled behind the scenes . As time passes , it becomes increasingly clear that disarmament must follow , and not precede , the providing of alternate ? and less illusory ? forms of security , though not security of the unreasonable kind and extent France has demanded . THE nervous state of the ' diplomats was shown by the series of incidents which came , probably by no accident , just before the disarmament conference opened . The Polish-Lithuanian dispute is to be discussed by the League within a fortnight ; and a few days ago , rumors suddenly became rife that Poland intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seized the city of Vilna seven years ago . Russia promptly warned Poland that such an action would not be tolerated . Litvinoff was in Berlin at the moment , on his way to Geneva . A conference ensued , between Stresemann and himself , and the statement they made public was interpreted as meaning that Germany and Russia would stand together against Poland . It is true that relations between Germany and Poland have long been bad ; but neither Germany nor Russia wants war if it can possibly be avoided . Practically speaking , Germany is disarmed ; and , in any case , she is playing a conciliatory game with France , whose satellite Poland is , and with England , in the hope of getting the Rhineland freed , reparations reduced , and some of her former colonies restored . Russia believes that the Baldwin government is only looking for an excuse to attack i her , and will certainly not resort to arms if she can help it . War is always a possibility , in Eastern Europe ; but at the moment it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of increasing strain . The Franco-Jugoslav treaty which caused such dismay , real or assumed , in Rome , has been " answered " by an Italo-Albanian compact , which runs for twenty years instead of the five specified in the former document . There is , of course , no reality to any new agreement between Italy and Albania ; the little country on the eastern shore of the Adriatic has long been in Mussolini 's pocket . For that matter , the treaty between France and Jugoslavia did no more than confirm an arrangement which had existed for some time . But diplomats who are able to ignore secret arrangements . can no longer do so when these have been brought out into the light . It may be true , as some optimistic observers believe , that France and Italy , which have always made faces at one another , would not carry their animosity past the danger point ; but the Balkans constitute a poor stage on which to indulge in such exercises . It is always possible that excited onlookers , not realizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . THE death of Premier Bratiano of Rumania is likely to have no immediate consequences of international interest . He has been succeeded as Premier , temporarily , by his brother , Vintila Bratiano , a much weaker character . Vintila has also been made titular leader of the misnamed Liberal party . The most powerful political group is now the National Peasants ' party , which , despite reports to that effect in the press , is by no means committed to the candidacy of Prince Carol for the throne . That young man , of whom the world has the right to be heartily tired , continues to blow hot and cold from his hiding place near Paris . Vintila Bratiano is seeking to conciliate the peasants by concessions , but is meeting with little success , and it would not be surprising to see the Liberals turned out of office at an election early in the new year . UNTIL the terms of the rumored loan of $40 , - 000,000 which J. P. Morgan and Company propose to make to the Japanese government on the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prudent not to criticize the project too drastically , but on the surface the loan seems to be doubtful as a matter both of business and politics . The security which the Japanese government has to offer is none too good , and might well be regarded with particular suspicion by an American banking house . The South Manchurian Railway Company is operating on a concession which expires in a few years , and was renewed in 1915 by a Chinese government which was helpless under Japanese pressure . Its validity is challenged by the Chinese Nationalists , and if they ever establish an effective government in Peking , the challenge will seriously impair the security of the Japanese title to the railway property in Manchuria which is now being mortgaged . Doubtless the Japanese government is fully capable of protecting its property by armed force , but a railway which needs an army to defend it against an increasingly powerful neighbor and against the probable resentment of the rapidly increasing Chinese population of Manchuria itself does not look like gilt-edged security for a loan . It was the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchurian railways raised against the peace of the Far East which prompted President Taft in 1909 to propose to Japan and Russia their neutralization , and if the quarrel involved a menace to peace in 1909 , it contains more of a menace in 1928 and after . J. P. Morgan and Company seem to be lending money not on one of the assets of the Japanese government , but on one of its gravest political liabilities . THERE has always been an influential body of opinion in the United States which has suspected , with reason , that the Allies in Europe would in the end try to unload on the United States the acceptance , in payment of the war debts , of Germany 's more dubious promise to pay reparations . This suspicion accounts for the refusal by any branch of the American government to permit the discharge Of war debts to become contingent upon the discharge of reparations . Yet , obviously , the two financial obligations form part of the same problem , and any satisfactory and permanent settlement of re ? partitions is inconceivable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of large annuities to the United States . Some time soon , the Dawes plan of raising and transferring reparations will come up for consideration , and when it does , there will be an effort to persuade the United States to enter a general conference which will have for its object a final liquidation of the debts which the various European nations owe to one another and to the United States as the result of the War . In view of the fact that eventually the United States will probably have to enter such a conference , it is not too soon to discuss what kind of settlement the American government could reasonably pro ' pose . In another column of this issue , Mr. S. 0 ' Levinson , of Chicago , suggests a plan which , in his opinion , would fairly divide the available assets among the creditors . It is certainly an ingenious proposal , which takes care of all the really imPurt ' ant financial obstacles to European appeasement ' It is the result of an intensive study of the problem which Mr. Levinson made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he was assisted by the training which he has obtained by his own pr ? ' fessional work , ' which has frequently involved the working out of railway reorganizations . Ile i9 December 7 , 1927 THE NEW PAUL Y. Anderson , Washington correspondent of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , has raised an interesting question in regard to the Teapot Dome transaction . It will be remembered that a dummy organization , the Continental Trading Company , was created , which bought and resold to affiliated companies a large amount of oil at an ad-vance of twenty-five cents a barrel . The " profits " on this paper transaction were invested in Liberty bonds , and some of these , to the value of $230 , - 500 , were traced to Secretary Fall and his son-in-law , M. T. Everhart . But this amount did not represent the total " earnings " of the Continental Trading Corporation . Before it went out of busi-ness it had accumulated more than $3,000,000 . Mr. Anderson asks , What became of the other $2 , - 770,000 ? The theory has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay off the Republican deficit of about $1,800,000 from the campaign of 1920 . Will Hays , on the witness stand , denied that Harry Sinclair had turned over any stock to the Republican war-chest , but said nothing about Liberty bonds . Of the five oil men who could tell what became of the missing $2,770 , - " 00 , one fled to Africa and two to Europe , and all refuse to return under any circumstances . A fourth , Sinclair , is a principal in a criminal pro-ceeding and can not be forced to testify . Stewart , the fifth , presumably will be a witness in the retrial of the Fall-Sinclair case . We are glad to note that Senator Norris proposes to have the Walsh coin-. mittee reopen its inquiry into the matter . ONE would suppose that the United States DePartrnent of Justice would have some interest in , this question . If a $3,000,000 fund is accumulated ? ) , shady methods and $230,500 of it is used for fraudulent purposes , is it not reasonable to suppose that the rest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General Sargent , the latter displayed no interest whatever la the matter , and declined to say a word about it . investigation is being made by the Department . , ' ne recipients of the Liberty bonds could be ' raced by the Treasury , through the simple process finding out who cashed the coupons , but this is not being done . It is difficult to avoid the con- cnaion that the Coolidge administration , instead ot wanting to find out where the money went , knows t11ere it went and has a lively fear that the people ) the country may come to share the information . S h t e present session of Congress opens , the i ' 33 ? hies are busy in Washington as they have not been for many years . We have already referred ? that which supports repeal of the federal estate- , r ; and has financed visits to Washington by scores uqt , state legislators and officials . Greatly over- this , however , is the lobby of the private vi:etrie-power interests , which are determined to pre-nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darn . This lobby boasts that it represents about twenty billion dollars in capital . It has enoaged as director Mr. Stephen B. Davis , former solicitor of the Department of Commerce under Herbert . Hoover . The National Electric Light Association ? one of the chief constituents of the movement ? has also raided the public service by engaging as its assistant director Mr. Paul S. Clapp , formerly assistant Secretary of Commerce under Mr. Hoover . Mr. Clapp has been touring the country attacking the government 's plans for Boulder Dam . The Association in a resolution states that the Boulder Dam project , which has been endorsed by President Coolidge , Secretary Work , and Reclamation Commissioner Elwood Mead , is supported by " enthusiasts and fanatics . " Representative Swing , one of the authors of the Swing-Johnson bill for Boulder Dam , estimates that the lobby will spend this year over $1,000,000 . Its main task at present , as an-nounced to newspaper correspondents at a dinner in Washington , " is to get Muscle Shoals out of the way and to beat Boulder Dam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these subjects are Lilliputians beside this giant . ON the Tariff Commission is a " dirt farmer , " Sherman J. Lowell , a past master of the National Grange . He appeared at the recent convention of the Grange in Cleveland with the solemn warning : " If we do n't use the tariff to protect our farmers , every war-torn country in Europe that owes us money will be trying to make us pay their debts by intriguing us to buy their products . We must be on our guard to prevent that . " This sounds like a fair sample of Republican tariff economics . It is disgraceful in the Europeans not to pay their debts to us . But it is shameful and dangerous intrigue for them to export goods to us as a means of paying . Just how does Mr. Lowell suggest that they pay ? By sending us gold ? There is not enough in the world . And we already have over half the world 's supply of monetary gold ? too much for our own good . Meanwhile , European currencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of paying are there besides sending goods or gold ? By supplying us with services such as shipping and insurance , and by selling goods and services to our travelers abroad . Presumably Mr. Lowell would think the former means as heinous as export . The only recourse left is for all the : umbers of the Grange , taking the large profits they have received from tariff protection , to spend the rest of their lives traveling abroad . Whereas , the number of marketing contracts so far signed by the members , old and new , of the Burley Tobacco Growers ' CoOperative Association , indicates a degree of indifference which makes doubtful the securing of 75 percent of the 1926 crop by November 15 , and Whereas , the opening of the 1927 selling season is now only thirty days away ; Therefore , be it resolved that , to protect the best interests of our membership and to provide adequate facilities for the handling and sale of their tobacco , it is ordered that work be immediately begun to put our receiving plants in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THUS passes another farmers ' coOperative marketing venture . And , of all the larger commodity coOperative societies organized during the post-war period , the Burley Growers ' was probably the strongest and best-managed . It arose from conditions which were both dramatic and chaotic . A tobacco pool had existed in Kentucky as far back as 1906-7 , but this ceased to exist before the recent movement of price deflation began . The new society emerged under the sponsorship of Judge Robert W. Bingham , at a time when night-riding and other means of terror were being employed by baffled farmers Under the management of James C. Stone , an experienced and able tobacco specialist , this association seemed to flourish during the early years of the five-year contract . Now , after a strenuous campaign for securing renewal and new contracts , the directors admit failure . DIRECTORS of the Burley Tobacco Growers ' Cooperative Association have not completely abandoned hope . They persist in believing that their organization may be saved , possibly for the handling of next year 's crop . However their efforts may eventuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present crisis leads to further reflections regarding our agricultural situation as a whole . Those statesmen and business men who recommend coOperative marketing as the primary remedy for the farmers ' difficulties are obviously oversimplifying the case . They presume that farmers are able somehow to become coOperative with respect to a single aspect of life while remaininn- in- dividualistic in other affairs . Cooperative market- ing , existing in social and economic insulation , can achieve nothing more than a temporary increase in prices for such commodities as are held in pools ; when this increased price is followed by increased production , the ensuing price must come down , whether the commodity is held in the warehouses of cooperators or those of speculators . And , when the price reaches a given level , cooperative loyalty is strained to the breaking-point . This is , of course , merely one of the perplexities which confront promoters of coOperative societies . The deeper social , psychic , and cultural values which are prerequisite to a true cooperative society are , for the most part , still unrecognized . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple discovery or invention of some smooth-running piece of marketing machinery . This economic focus produces those various blind-spots which prevent us from seeing the whole of our agricultural problem .
