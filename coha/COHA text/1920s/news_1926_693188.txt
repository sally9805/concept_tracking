txt The Cardinals won . The baseball drama had a happy ending after all , for as the last reel faded out the sentimental favorites were holding the championship . They beat the Yankees and the Yankees beat themselves , and between the two the greatest game of the series went to St. Louis , 3-2 . The old story can be written again . The breaks of the game decided it . To baseball history can be added one more chapter where the seventh game of the big series was decided , not by skill or courage , but by fate . After millions of words had been scribbled and tons of white paper covered with expert calculations , the world 's series worked itself down to four short words : Koenig 's fumble , Eleusel 's muff . If Mark Koenig , the Yankee short : stop , had gripped his fingers around a grounder in the fourth inning ; if the veteran Bob Meusel had caught an easy fly that bobbed out of his hands in the same round , the Yanks would have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbed of Shut-Out . If the Cardinals had not scored three unearned runs on those two devastating errors , Waite Hoyt would not have been robbed for the second time in his career of the glory of a shut-out in the final game of the world 's series . Babe Ruth would not today be mourning the fact that his home run in the third did not bring the championship to New York single-handedly and unaided . And St. Louis last night and through the early hours of the morning would not have been celebrating the happy ending to its wait of thirty-eight years . Everything was incidental to those two , errors . It was incidental that Herb Pennock came back to pitch in a hopeless cause . It was incidental , even though highly dramatic , that in the seventh inning , with the bases full and two out , Alexander the Great came out of the shadows of the bullpen to strike out Tony Lazzeri and throttle the Yankees ' last great rally . It was incidental , too , that Tommy Thevenow , Cardinal shortstop , drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alexander wrote finis to the hopes of the surging Yanks with an old hand but a steady one . To his already superb work in the series he added this one climax . His pitching in the series was probably the greatest since the days of Matty and Babe Adams , but if Meusel and Koenig had held on to the ball , Alex would have been merely a gallant old pitcher on a losing ball team . Fate made a hero of Alexander and a victim of Hoyt . Fate was the scene shifter who set the stage in the seventh , out upon which Alexander shuffled . His cap was perched on one side of his ' lead and he was slowly chewing a quid of tobacco . He was a quaint , almost humorous , figure with his jaunty cap , his old man 's gait and his quizzical face , but when he wound up his arm and threw , the Yanks bad reached the end of the trail . There was nothing more left for them . They bad ' battled through six ' games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers when suddenly they came face to face with Alex . While 40,000 went wild with de- ' light , he stood across the path and the Yanks took a detour to second-place money in the greatest money series of all time , In the third , Babe Ruth hit his fourth homer , setting a new record for a single series . With Hoyt pitching the game of a lifetime , this run looked enough to win . But in the fourth Koenig fumbled and Meusel muffed , and the Yanks found themselves two runs behind . Haines Always In Danger . Miller Huggins reorganized his scattered battalion and the Yanks charged on . They swirled at Jess Haines in the sixth and luck was with them this time , for Chick Haley played a line drive rashly and when the ball rushed past him Dugan scored with the second run . Only one to go now , and . Haines , his pitching hand bearing the bruise of a batted ball , was weakening . In the seventh , Combs opened with a single over Thevenow 's head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mien and menace in their bats . Koenig sacrificed Combs to second and Ruth was walked intentionally . Meusel , the unfortunate lad with the feeble fingers of an earlier inning , had his chance to wipe the slate clean , but his grounder to Bell was turned into ' a forceout of Ruth at second while Combs dashed on to third . Gehrig now at bat , ' whose single had won one game and his double helped to min another . Haines faltered after he had thrown two strikes on the native-born New Yorker . Something suddenly went wrong with the Haines right arm . He floated three bad balls up to the plate , and another high one , around the neck of the Yankee , sent Gehrig to first and filled the bases . Rogers Hornsby called his men into a huddle and they grouped themselves around the pitcher 's box like the Yale backfield . Hornsby ; O'Farrell , Haines , Bottomley , Bell , Thevenow  --  they were all there . When the confernce broke up , Haines took off his glove and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new pitcher . Forty thousand pair of eyes peered anxiously through the gray mist toward the bull pen out in deep left . There was a breathless pause , and then around the corner of the stand came a tall figure in a Cardinal sweater . His cap rode rakishly on the corner of his bead . He walked like a man who was going nowhere in particular and was in no hurry to get there . He was a trifle knock-kneed and his gait was not a model of grace and rhythm . the Fans Knew Him . Any baseball fan would have known him a mile away . It was Grover Cleveland Alexander . Alexander the Great was coming in to pull the Cardinal machine out of the mudhole. lhe ancient twirler , who had gone nine full innings the day before , was shuffling in where younger men feared to tread . On any other day he would have been sitting contentedly on the bench , chewing his quid and ruminating on life in general and the ball game in Particular . This time he was plucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last hope of the Cardinals . He warmed up in that leisurely , methodical way of his , and as be faced Lazzeri , fresh young slugger from the Coast , he was outwardly as unconcerned as if it were a Spring exhibition game . Throughout the park there came a silence . The fans slid forward to the edge of their seats . Hardly a mother 's son of them seemed to be moving a muscle , but , although the crowd was rigid with the thrill of the moment , old Alex was undisturbed . He had been through all that before . Apparently there was n't a nerve in his body . Ball one to Lazzeri was low and the crowd stirred , but Alex calmly carved the outside corner with a strike , like a butcher slicing ham . Another one outside and Lazzeri fouled it into the stand . The Yankee was now in the hole . " This lad is in a tighter fix than I am , " thought Alex , and so he essayed a low curve that one of the Singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The deed was done . Alex took off his glove and shuffled again to the bench . The Cardinals , young and impetuous , pounded his back and hugged him madly , but old Alex took it with placid good humor  --  not the shadow of a smile on his face . Only once did be turn his head and send a half-smile toward the stand , and we suspect that that was his only vesture of triumph . In the eighth the Yanks went out one-two-three . The old arm of Alexander was now rising and falling with ? a steady beat , tolling off the last minutes of the world 's series . Against him was Pennock , but Alex had a one-run lead and there was nothing in his mellow past which made any one believe that Alexander would lose a one-run lead in the ninth inning of the last world 's series game . Combs and Koenig were child 's play for him , as the Yankees ' final onslaught began . With two strikes against him Combs grounded to Bell and was out . Koenig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the same fielder an easy roller . And now the drama was almost done . There was only one more scene . Ruth was at bat  --  the Yankee 's last hope . Would Alexander pitch to him as he had to lesser men ? It would have been the last great story of the series if Alex had fanned him . But Alex was not concerned with great stories , drama , climaxes. headlines or anything else of the sort . He pitched carefully and deliberately " to Ruth . He brought the count to three and two , one being a called strike and another a foul , but Alex just missed the corner of the plate on the next one and the Babe walked . Ruth Caught at Second . The old-timer was taking no chances ? on Ruth hitting another into the farflung bleachers . Meusel rather than Ruth was the program , but before Meusel could settle the issue Ruth did it for him by breaking for second : base . O'Farrell whipped a fast throw to Hornsby and the series was over . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother lies dead , . and Alexander the Great can go back to his easy chair , his slippers and a Winter fireplace and dwell pleasantly , on the October afternoon when Tony Lazzeri swung at a low ball which a , Singer midget could not have hit . If Alex wants to chuckle , he is clearly ' entitled to it . . He can look back to a series which saw him winning two masterful victories and helping to win a third . The man who was fired by Joe McCarthy , manager of the Cubs , in midsummer came back in October to turn out one of the greatest world's. series pitching achievements . Matty , Babe Adams , Combs and Coveleskie twirled three victories in other baseball classic , but they were all young men and full of strength . - Alex was not only old , he was a uaseball discard , tossed onto the scrap : - heap as an antique without worth . Rogers Hornsby can go back to Texas with the comforting thought that he " stayed with the team " and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country as only Walter Johnson before him had done is undoubtedly glad the series is over . Not for him any triumphant celebrations ; he has discharged one duty only to take on another . Nineteen Playing Records Set , , The series set nineteen playing records , so far as the statisticians have been able to discover , and was the greatest ever in total receipts and attendance . Although yesterday 's crowd Was a miserable disappointment , with only 38.093 paid , It was enough to send the attendance up to 328,051 , and the receipts to $1,207,864 . The best previous records were 301 , - 172 last October and $1,182,854 in 1923 . When 63,600 paid to see the second game in the Stadium , all marks for a single day 's attendance were also passed . The total of winning and losing players ' share was bigger than anything before . The weather man is being blamed for yesterday 's financial slump . Showers and an overcast sky in the morning made it certain that the crowd would be small . Not many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets before noon , and when the general moisture kept up after 12 o'clock the hopes for a capacity crowd were ruined . There was some expectation that the game would not be played at all , but V Commissioner Landis stopped that by announcing the game would take place ' V humanly possible . " The Judge reI membered his experience last October , when he postponed the final game only to run into worse weather the next day . Hoyt pitched fine ball all the way I through . For a short spell he was again the Hoyt of 1921 , when his work against the , Giants earned him . the brief sobriquet , a " second Matty . " His fast ball was a work of art and his curve the best he has shown in five years  --  both wonderfully controlled and hopping through like the'wlnd . Hoyt , the staff on which the Yanks leaned In the big test , came through in magnificent style , but it wag again his misfortune to be beaten by the breaks of the game . HIS mind must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of that series Roger Peckinpaugh booted a ball away and Hoyt lost , 1 to 0 . Once again fate came along to kick him on the.shins . Ruth had hit his homer and when the fourth opened Hoyt was in front ? of Hornsby 's easy grounder . Bottomley took a swing at the first ball and singled to left . Hoyt , still working like a well-oiled machine , forced Bell to ground to Koenig , who had an easy double play in sight . Shortstop Fumbles . But the kid shortstop played the ball to one side , and in his eagerness to kill two birds with one stone fumbled the roller . One bad break for Hoyt followed another . With two strikes and no balls against Hafey , the left fielder lifted a weak fly which fell in left between the scurrying figures of Koenig and Memel . The bases were full and only one out , and fate was saving its best prank for the last . O'Farrell raised a fly to left centre . Hensel , having a stronger arm than Combs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw to the plate . There was only an outside chance of keeping Bottomley from scoring , but Meusel did not even catch the ball . The white pill hit his outstretched hands and popped out again , like a rabbit from the magician 's hat . For a minuta there was a stunned silence . Even the Cardinals were so taken aback that they hardly knew what to do . Bottomley , of course , was lighting out for the plate , and the others finally got into action and ran for the next base . There is only one - explanation for the Meusel muff . He tried to throw the ball before he got it , and thereby made himself the greatest worlds ' series " goat " since Fred Snodgrass of Giant fame . With the score tied and bases still full , Hoyt settled gamely down , but . the breaks had beaten him . He laid two strikes over on Thevenow and was pitching stanchly when the boy shortstop happened to tap the ball with the end of his bat and loop a safe hit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pitching like Matty of old , was beaten nevertheless . He was beaten ' like Matty of 1.912 , when Snodgrass muffed an easy fly . You have heard of the famous " *100,000 muff . " You know ' about the time Hank Gowdy tripped over his mask and lost the deciding game of the 1924 series . You know about Peckinpaugh of last October , but they were as nothing compared to the fumble of Koenig and the muff of Meuse . Biggest Money Series . For this was the biggest money series of all , with the spoils bigger and the stake greater . There has never been a seven-game world 's series without the seventh game producing its Meusels and Snod grasses and Gowdys . Hoyt now joins the unhappy ranks with Mathewson , Virgil Barnes and Walter Johnson . John can sympathize with Miller Huggins , for It happened to him twice . There has also never been a full-limit series ' which ended satisfactorily ? never a seventh game decided strictly on its merits . Invariably the breaks have decided it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they march down to a final game with honors squarely divided . For three straight years this has happened . and in each case the winner was the winner because on that afternoon the " run of the cards " was with him . To hang the baseball title on one game is equivalent to staking the golf championship on a single putt . To Ruth as well as to Hoyt should go the heart-felt condolences of Yankee rooters . The playboy of baseball might have beard his name go ringing down the corridors of baseball as a man who won a series game with a home run . It was the only earned run of the game . In the third Haines was going along nicely until he met Ruth . Jess fell back to his slow ball . Ruth fouled the first one into the stand , but the next one was too low and was a ball . I The third was slow and inside ; reminiscent of the pitch which Rhem served to him in St. Louis . Babe 's Timing Perfect . The Babe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember that it was a slow ball and hard to knock for any distance . Ruth had to supply the momentum himself , yet he whaled that ball clear over the outfielders ' heads and Into the bleachers of right-centre . Barely hurdling the fence , the ball passed directly over the words " World 's Champions " in the razor ad . " A happy omen , " yelled the Yankee rooters . It was a good omen until Koenig and Meuse ) ruined it , for with that blow Ruth would have made world 's champions of the Yankees . , A crowd lukewarm toward the Yanks rose to its feet and acclaimed the king as he has not been acclaimed In years . The furor and the din were ear-splitting , and to the Cardinals it must have sounded like the crack of doom . It was Ruth 's second great moment in the series , the first being when he hit three homers in the fourth game at St. Louis . His total for the series was four , setting a record , and his total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-water mark . Geroge Herman started the winning rally in one game with a single , carried the flag in another with three homers , and would have won the last but for the mistakes of his teammates . In this series Ruth and Pennock were nine-tenths of the Yanks . It was Ruth who also made the most sensational play , of the closing game when he sprinted at top speed back almost to the - running track and enfolded O'Farrell 's terrific line drive in ' his glove , thrust up and out as the Babe left his feet ever so slightly . For this he got another tornado of cheers from the multitude . Ruth was carrying the crowd by storm . In another inning his apathetic subjects were actually rooting for the Yankees  --  the greatest tribute possible to the colorful personality of King George . Thevenow also unpeeled a spectacular jumping one-hand catch of a liner , but the two most vital plays of the game were passed by almost unnoticed . In the second , Dugan started on a steal of second . O'Farrell saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Haines 's pitch almost hit the ground , but O'Farrell , going on his right knee , stopped the ball , rose swiftly and with a whistling throw tried to head him off . Being greatly hurried , the toss was low , but Hornsby snared it with a beautiful stop and dug the ball into Dugan 's ankle . How important a play it was may be gleaned from the fact that Severeid singled a minute later and would have scored Dugan from second . In the sixth Dugan singled again and scored on Severeid 's two-bagger , which got past Hafey when he ran in for an impossible catch instead of playing it safe . Paschal went up to bat for Hoyt with the tying run on second and two out . Adams ran for Severeid . Here Paschal spouted a grounder which almost cleared Haines 's head and was aimed for deep short . If it got past Haines , Paschal would make first and Adams third , but Haines saved the situation by picking the ball out of the air and killing the batter at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outfielded , but their superior experience and balance carried them along . Even those assets were failing them until Ruth completely turned the tide with his St. Louis homers . Those three pitched balls almost cost the Cardinals the title . Ruth is still the Yankee team . The Cards made great talk about pitching to him , but in the deciding game they walked him four out of five times . It was a series of great crowds and busy turnstiles , but not much action compared to many another series . Not a well-played series and not a thrilling one , except in spots . The breaks were evenly divided . The new champions earned what they got , and old Alex earned a quiet Winter in his rocking chair .
