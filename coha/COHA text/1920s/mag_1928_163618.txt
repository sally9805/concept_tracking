While the eyes of the world were sweeping the Atlantic , anxious , fearful of the fate of two flying Germans and an Irishman , a tiny plane droned its way across the unknown waste and terror of the Arctic . Impervious to disappointment , danger , tragedy , Capt . George Hubert Wilkins and Lieut . Carl Ben Eielson took off unannounced from Point Barrow , Alaska , came down for five dismal days on uninhabited Doedmansoeira ( Dead Man 's Island ) , arrived last week triumphant at the haven of Spitzbergen . <P> Briefly , a message from Spitzbergen announced that man had for the first time flown over " the roof of the world " in an airplane . Who sent the message no one knew , for the single wireless operator of this freezing colony of miners and trappers , was killed in an accident weeks ago and the new one had not yet arrived . Perhaps it was Capt . Wilkins himself , announcing success after three years of struggle , three attempted flights , five smashed planes , the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrd flew from Spitzbergen to the pole and back again and the Amundsen-Ellsworth expedition flew all the way across in the opposite direction in a dirigible . <P> " No foxes seen " said the cryptic message received from Capt . Wilkins by Dr. Isaiah Bowman , director of the American Geographical Society . It meant there was no land between Point Barrow and Spitzbergen and put an end to the fond dream of a vast continent in the " blind spot " of the Arctic . <P> No trip could be more difficult or more hazardous . Because of the constant variation of the compass in such close proximity to the magnetic pole , navigation is a matter of genius . Because the vast area is unexplored , landing in case of emergency becomes a matter of prayer . No ship patrols the frozen reaches of the Arctic ; no lighthouse points the way . Said Commander Byrd : " I congratulate him most heartily . " Added Lincoln Ellsworth : " My hat comes off to the pluck of a brave gentleman . " <P> The dangers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greenland side over a region never before seen by articulate man , particularly beckoned to Capt . Wilkins . He finally made it in 20 hours of flying time , in a small Lougheed Vega plane capable of a sustained speed of 135 miles an hour . His record indicates that he would have made the trip had it taken forever . <P> In 1925 , Capt . Wilkins-Australian adventurer , photographer in the Balkan War , cameraman for Stefansson in his North <P> Pole dash , World War flier , second in command of the ill-fated Shackleton expedition to the South Pole-induced the American Geographical Society and the Detroit Aviation Society to back an east-to-west flight over the North Pole . This was before either Byrd or Amundsen reached the Pole from Spitzbergen . <P> Wilkins started for Alaska in the winter of 1926 , heading what was then called " the most scientifically planned and thoroughly equipped Arctic expedition ever assembled . " His twin objects were " new lands for the United States and an airway across the top of the world . " Furthermore , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special utility of its own as against an airship costing about $500,000.
