txt Henry Ford is today the most dramatic figure in the United States . His stage setting is wonderful . He has proposed more impossible things , attempted more impossible things and committed more public foolishness than any other man before the American public . But he has done the one impossible thing . He had made the horseless carriage , and made it so , cheap that the horse and buggy have disappeared , the family carriage is on the scrapheap , and , if the people will not eat horsemeat , they must find a new use for that noble animal . No such stupendous change has ever been wrought by one man in the economics of any nation . Yet Henry Ford is , in no sense , an economist , is ignorant of history and is blind as a bat to many of the common factors of everyday life . FORD IN POI.ITI ota He has , however . an almost uncanny sense of the aims , ambitions and prejudices of the common people , and to a degree that might make him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the world that he is a crusader in the field of the gasoline motor and not a cl usader of the Middle Ages . A few hundred years ago he would have been a danger as a Jew baiter . Now as the author of modern attacks upon the Jews he is just as ridiculous a'figure , swindled and fooled in his historic ignorance by the fictitious Jewish " protocols , " as he was in sailing his peace ship into the European war field to get the boys out of the trenches by Christmas  --  a peace ship laden with all the fighting elements of divergent soci alism . Henry Ford can surround himself with more fiction than any other man and win popular applause by it . He can annex a poverty railroad to his factory , load it with his own cars to be taken to distant lines , depriving home terminals of their natural traffic , and then call for reduced railroad rates and pose as one who raises railroad wages and will reduce railroad rates if permitted . And this ' in a field where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more than 90% of the rates . Burlington directors , at a special meeting here , authorized Claude G. Burnham , executive vice-president , to make a final settlement for the railroad with the Government . Hale Holden , president and chairman of the company , has been in Europe , and will not arrive in this country for about ten days . Settlement will be concluded within a few days , and announcement , it is expected , will be made from Washington early next week . The more important terms of settlement have been agreed upon , and only some minor details remain to be negotiated . Amount which the road will receive was not stated by directors . Owing to the fact that Burlington 's dividend is now on a semi-annual basis , no action is to be expected this month . and probably none until late November . Indication is that the $10 rate , initiated in May , will be maintained . BEATING WALL STREET The world shouts that Henry Ford has beaten Wall Street , the Jew and the money lenders who are seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public to believe it . A year ago Henry Fird came East and asked advice . Orders were falling off , and at a rate which meant the closing of his factory in the winter time . He wanted advice as to whether he should reduce his rates or reduce his forces . He did both , but neither Jews nor Wall Street nor money lenders were responsible . He smashed automobile prices over the country and then closed his factories . He had $55,000,000 in taxes to pay , and over $30,000 , - 000 of other indebtedness to meet . Therefore hurry-up calls went out for a loan of $75,000,000 , and he found he could get the money at the then market rate of 8Szs's 's . Again he asked for eastern advice , and the bankers who had been instrumental in canvassing the field for the Ford money gave him the best advici he ever had . HOW WALL , STREET MADE FORD These ' Wall Street bankers , these money Shylocks that Henry Ford is so fond of denouncing , further advised him frankly : . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get the money , we advise you to try to get along without it . " And Sir . Ford then had opened before him a vision of economics of which he had never dreamed . He had always denounced debts , mortgages and bonds , as well as corporate shares . He took the Wall Street advice , opened his factory , manufactured his spare parts into cars , ordered additional supplies and demanded credit therefor . Then he shipped his cars to his thousands of agents over the world with draft attached and made them do the borrowing . He took the Wall Street advice and distributed his burden . This is exactly the function of Wall Street in corporation promotion and finance . The astonished agents asked what they were to do with these curs . They were told to go to their local bank if they needed credit to pay for them , but they were also told if they wanted to keep their agency they would Pay for those cars and then get out and hustle to sell them . And the agents paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold the cars in a rising spring market . Then Mr. Ford told the world how he had beaten Wall Street and turned the corner without their assistance ; how they thought they had him and how he eluded them and defied them . EXPANDING FORD CREDITS Now Henry Ford again finds orders falling off as a year ago . He again reduces his prices as he could well afford to , as in hiS adversity he had eliminated vast waste in his organization ; a waste which has been known to observers for many years . Again he is shipping Fords in carload lots with draft attached and with no other notice to his agents than the drafts . The agents say : " All right . We hustled before and sold the cars , and think we can do it again . " But Mr. Ford is shipping his cars to his agents in the Fall and not in the Spring , and their future sales may depend somewhat upon the winter weather and the financial times . Fortunately for Mr. Ford , the corporation inventories of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is room for Mr. Ford 's agents to do a reasonable amount of financing . Of course the Ford agent is financing from that Wall Street which Mr. Ford denounces . Wall . Street from Trinity Church to the East River is a very short street . and the foot of it is only shipping and sugar . But , in reality , Wall Street belts the world of finance and as such is the longest and most potential street in the world . It is this Wall Street that is now again sustaining Mr. Ford through his agents ' financing . Some people say what a fine presidential candidate would be Henry Ford ; see how he beats Wall Street . And he does . He gets Wall Street advice and Wall Street 's money and then clubs Wall Street . Can you beat it ? What ought to interest Henry Ford and what ought to interest every person interested in the development of the gasolene motor , the greatest modern invention , and its expansion for the material benefit and progress of the United States , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ford has financed  --  financed on Wall Street advice and Wall Street principles of distributing the burden of credit and using capital in concentrated production . Unless the burden of taxation is to be removed from capital , there are breakers ahead for all manufacturers attempting to meet econimically any increased public demand . TAX BUMPERS Mr. Ford and every other automobile manufacturer must get ready for another tax bumper . It is inevitable that the motors of this country shall , in justice , be called upon to pay a measure of the cost of the roads built and surfaced for them . The highways of this country , are being remade for benefit of the gasoline motor , and their remaking is supported by tax-free state and municipal bonds . The motors are wearing out many roads before the bonds that built them mature or can be paid . At least one-half the motoring of the country is in the nature of a luxury . The other half is in the nature of an economy , as respects both passengers and freight . Motors are competitors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained by the credit of the United States government and taxes upon capital . Indeed it may be declared that the capital in the steam roads is being destroyed by policies of the national government while state and local capital invested in highways is being eaten up by the untaxed motor industry . Two JUSTICE OF THE IrTTITHE It is right.and proper to point out to motor manufacturers and gasoline consumers that they must some day face the problem of paying just taxes . They can not forever go on destroying both the national steam and the local oil-surfaced highways . England from 800,000 motors collects $40,000,000 in taxes . On the same basis the United States would collect $500,000,000 in taxes . Some day justice will figure the millions that should be collected from the users of both the steel highways and the oil highways . Herein are the great underlying problems of taxation yet to be settled , and motor manufacturers and motor users must be prepared some day to meet ? justice . Every delay in justice multiplies a liability . THE FORD BALANCE SHEET . Recently Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third time within the year . He shows to the Michigan secretary of state , as of June 30. total assets of $263,368,199 , but press agents of Mr. Ford do not reveal that those contrast with assets of $254,551,041 of six months before or with $345,140,557 three months before . The popular press also reports that this statement of . Ttine 30 shows a surplus of $156,686,672 . But it neglects to state that this is a reduction in three months from a reported surplus of $182,877,696 . Of course Mr. Ford has not been losing money in the last three months , but for some occult reason he has been marking down his assets . Perhaps he has taken some more Wall Street advice and marked down his plant to offset his late earnings and thereby save some taxes . Mr. Ford must have gotten a considerable fright last year when he faced his tax situation . Of course Mr. Ford finds it popular and agreeable to put forth his " How I Beat Wall Street , " but he will probably hesitate to give any pointers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " THE FORD MACHINERY SHRINKAGE He reports his machinery and equipment at a valuation of only $2,1,183,990 , while April 30 he reported the valuation $46,459,046 . Can anybody suppose that Mr. Ford has lost more than half his equipment in three months ? Of course he is just taking the Wall Street advantage of the situation and setting forth that now that values are going back to pre-war basis , it is a good ' time to write down your equipment possibly in ' offset of profits , likewise your real estate . It has been popularly told that Mr. Ford has been making enormous expansions . Indeed , wicked Wall Street heard eight months ago that it was plant expansion that troubled Mr. Ford . But now Wall Street and possibly the tax-gatherer are to be taught a lesson and this time concerning shrinkages in valuation ; for his plant in real estate , which was reported April 30 at $71,329,719 , is now reported to the state of Michigan at $46,026,010 . Here is a joint write-off of $50,000,000 . Can it be offset against earnings ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money Shylocks and Wall Street .
