txt To the Editor of Tire brew York Times : Unquestionably Congress will accept the settlement of the British Debt Commission which the President is to Pre/ sent this week . To do otherwise is inconceivable . But is it not possible to bring to bear upon the Senate the indignation which some of us feel , and which every American can be counted on to share , over the treatment it received at the hands of some Senators when the subject was just now referred to ? When after long and anxious conference an important commission appointed for the work had succeeded in reaching a settlement on terms which England accepts and to which Europe is looking as opening a way to the many adjustments which involve the peace of the world , . at the first mention of it men should , rise in the Senate denouncing the commission . appealing to the lowest passion of the people , charging that it is proposed to take millions from our already overburdened taxpayers to make a present to the British , and all because of a proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an exhibition , whatever the motive , that must put every citizen to shame . The facts can not be too often stated . England borrowed from us 4,136 million dollars for her needs in the war . Of this , every dollar was expended here in the purchase of goods for which she paid war prices . In addition to this she purchased from us also 1,000 million dollars ' worth of goods for which she supplied the funds and we had the benefit . The interest accruing on our loan at the rate we charged , namely , 5 per cent. , amounts to nearly another billion dollars today . To meet the debt , which England is bending every effort to accomplish . every man and woman in Great Britain with an income . of $1,000 and upward is paying 25 per cent . to the Government . a rate of taxation unparalleled anywhere . The Engilsn Commissioners asked to have the rate of interest reduced to 121 , . ' , - per cent . from the beginning and , finding ' this had no chance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another VI of 1 1 per cent . for a sinking fund . The Americans finally proposed 41 , .. a. per cent . to date , 3 per cent . for ten years , and after that 5n:3 per cent. , to continue until the debt was liquidated , probably in fifty-two years . This was accepted and is at once confirmed in Britain . The total sum required is staggering , especially under existing world conditions . The London Times says : " Taking everything into consideration , the importance of every reasonable settlement in this world of chaos , the immeasurable hfWm which may arise from too protracted bargaining , the legal strength of the American case and the manifest good-will of the spokesman , we are definitely of the opinion that the supreme effort should be made to accept the terms . " The Telegraph says : " The truth is that if this debt is not funded at once it will hang like a cloud over our home politics , ruin the budget and retard industrial recovery . It will also bedevil our Anglo-American 1 relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be worth almost anything to us to remove any possible source of friction between ourselves and the United States , and the probabilities always are that an unsettled question like this will become more difficult rather than more easy to settle . " Can it he possible . after the honor we have received and the satisfaction we daily feet over the return of the Chi ; nese indemnity and our withdrawal from Cuba and our final settlements with Spain , that we are in this far greater hour to appear as contending over a fractional difference in the rate of interest to be paid us in the settlement of such a debt . contending for our pound of flesh , " squeezing a dollar till it screams " ? Can not the very shame of the thought he brought to arrest disparaging talk and secure for the President 's report prompt and appreciative acceptance ? Is it indeed too much to ask that it be exnre ... sed in terms that in some worthy form shall convey the nation 's understanding of the greet rule England is taking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
