The Austrian Parliament resounded last week with furious criticisms of the Italian Administration of Lower Tyrol . This province , which Italians call the Higher Adige , was transferred by post-War treaties from Austria-Hungary to Italy . Last week in the Austrian Parliament deputies Kold and Abrams of Higher Tyrol , which is still Austrian , luridly described the sufferings of Lower Tyrolese under Il Duce 's regime of impetuous Italianization . <P> Cried Deputy Abrams " beautiful women are incarcerated without cause in the prisons of Lower Tyrol and are released only when they have surrendered their chastity to brutal Italian jailers ! " Deputy Kold revamped in detail the familiar fact that Italianization of the Lower Tyrol ( or Higher Adige ) has been ruthlessly carried out , even to the extent of altering from German into Italian the very names of streets and the lettering on tableware in formerly Austrian hotels . <P> These charges are familiar , but what gave them weight last week was a statement by Chancellor of Austria Monsignor Ignaz Seipel . He rose in the Austrian Parliament and declared " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompatible with minority rights , and is a hindrance to further amicable relations between Austria and Italy , which are very desirable . " To explain and excuse the Austrian Parliament 's outspoken criticism of Italian Administration of the Lower Tyrol , Chancellor Seipel shrewdly added " the Italian Government must realize that there is quite a difference between interference in another nation 's domestic affairs and expressing disapproval of those affairs . " <P> Result : The Italian Minister at Vienna , Signor Giacinto Auriti immediately left for Rome to inform Il Duce of precisely what had occurred . Rumor visioned a diplomatic break between Italy and Austria , but more likely loomed the prospect that Il Duce would administer to Austria a tongue lashing similar to that which he indulged in against Germany when Foreign Minister Doktor Gustav Stresemann flayed the Italianization of Lower Tyrol . <P> The expected counter blast from Signor Mussolini was anticipated last week by the authoritative Giornale D'ltalia of Rome which described Chancellor Seipel 's speech as " insincere , " and asserted that the Higher Adige is governed " with the same regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing in all other Italian provinces .
