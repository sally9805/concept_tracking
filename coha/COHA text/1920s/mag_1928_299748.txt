Ringside . The writing of " racket " plays has become a racket in itself . This play , the latest in the Fight Game series , improves on many of its predecessors by furnishing a complete set of characters of its own instead of " ad-libbing " from the newspapers . The square jawed hero , for example , is a lightweight instead of the usual heavyweight . He is not a facsimile of Benny Leonard , Sammy Mandell or any other celebrity . He is simply Bobby Murray , a type instead of a borrowed headline . Actor Richard Taber makes the part into a distinct , albeit dull personality . Actor John Meehan does even better , much better , as Peter Murray , iron-grey manager-father . <P> The plot consists of Father Murray 's struggle to keep Son Murray from " throwing " the championship for the sake of an expert brunette ( Actress Suzanne Caubaye ) who gets her orders from a masterminded nightclub gangster ( Actor Robert Gleckler of Broadway fame ) . Father Murray has the assistance of an Honest Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> As in all such pieces nowadays , the fight-talk , crook-talk and woman-talk is entertaining and inoffensive because it seems to come from the interstices , rather than the undercrust of contemporary society . <P> The action lolls a bit at first but is sped up handsomely before the finish by a shooting and a whacking good imitation of a prizefight . The play is the work of Edward E. Paramore , Hyaat Daab , and George Abbott , an able and versatile trio . At the first night Tex Rickard was found babbling enthusiastically in the lobby which produced a rumor to the effect that he was backing the show. * Right beside Ringside will open The Big Fight , starring Tex Rickard 's onetime breadwinner , Jack Dempsey , et ux. ; thus providing theatre-goers with an example of dramatic coincidence and the opportunity to show whether they prefer a good approximation to the real thing . <P> Gentlemen of the Press . The second newspaper play to arrive in town this season was immediately subjected to a comparison with the first , The Front Page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The comparison , though , was interesting for it proved that truth , stranger than fiction , is not as exciting when placed upon the stage . Gentlemen of the Press lacks the hectic , unreal , melodramatic turbulence of the Hecht-MacArthur piece and insomuch it is a more true and a less compelling drama . Ward Morehouse of the dramatic page of the New York Sun wrote it ; he should and does know city rooms such as the one in a corner of which his play begins and ends . <P> It begins when Wick Snell , a laconic newshawk , leaves his job to become a press agent . The next act discovers Public <P> Relations Counsel Snell , in a chintz and mahogany suite , giving a party for the newspaper boys and abusing his employer . At the end of the play , he is back again in the city room with his feet on a desk and his snout in a telephone . A news rag , one gathers , is as inescapable as a winding sheet ; the adherents of the prying profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
