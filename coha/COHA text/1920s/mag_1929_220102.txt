Warm breezes drifted in from the nearby ocean . Hot air arose in the press . A mellow Florida moon lurked behind drifting clouds . Forty thousand men and women in a bowl of raw yellow pine-the Greeks knew how to do these things much better-looked not at the elusive moon but at a garish cone of artificial light in the bowl 's bottom . <P> " Oh , it 's a great party , " said Radio Announcer Graham McNamee into his microphone . <P> Look where you might , you saw people whom lots of people say they know-Rex Ellingwood Beach , who writes ; Ray Long , who edits ; John Golden , who produces ; Charles Edwin Mitchell , who banks . <P> Mrs. Irene Castle McLaughlin wore a frock of jade green crepe and a small hat of absinthe felt . Herbert Bayard Swope , who indorsed Lucky Strikes , looked overheated George Palmer Putnam , who publicizes , was there . Walter P.

Also , over his non-existent eye , he wore a monocle . The unfortunate thing was that , having scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that almost all the other gentlemen present were wearing white flannels , dark blue coats . <P> " One Eye " crashed the Fitzsimmons-Jeffries fight ( 1899 ) by exchanging a basket of stage money lor a basket of tickets . He saw the Jimmy Gardiner-Tommy Devine fight in a Milwaukee Armory ( 1903 ) from a steel girder to which he strapped himself early in the morning before the fight . He crashed the Dempsey-Gibbons fight in Shelby , Montana ( 1923 ) , by riding into the hot arena in a covered ice wagon . <P> " Round four coming up , said Mr McNamee , whose phrasing is original , sometimes . <P> Looking around some more you could see William Harrison Dempsey , the evening 's promoter ; Estelle Taylor , cinemactress when she is n't being Mrs. Dempsey ; A J Drexel Biddle Jr. , Harvey S. Firestone , John Ringling , Baron &; Baroness de Bonsetten , Irving Berlin , Senator Robert M. ( " Young Bob " ) La Follette , Publisher Paul Block . Charles B. Dillingham .
