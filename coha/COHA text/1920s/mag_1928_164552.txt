With dubious incredulity and then with exhilaration Germans learned , last week , that in Paris students of the Latin Quarter were rushing up and down the Grands Boulevards shouting and successfully inciting passersby to shout , " Vive L'Alle-magne ! " ( Long Live Germany ! ) <P> Astounding , the news of these shouts spurred the German press to put forth special edition after special edition . Almost proven was the cynical theory that all Germans , from Friedrich the Great down , have nurtured a suppressed desire to be understood and warmly approved by choosey Frenchmen . <P> Last week the focus of this ebullient international incident was a Berlin cab driver , " Iron Gustav " Hartmann , 69 . Clad in a neat navy blue great coat , beaming behind his reddish beard , and nursing a fat cigar , " Iron Gustav " rode triumphantly up the Champs Elysees , acknowledging the chorus of perhaps ironic " Vives ! " with stately bows and majestic flourishings of his high , white stovepipe hat . <P> Two months ago Cabby Hartmann , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife reduced to penury and possessed of no business capital except a 35-year-old cab and Grassmus , his 13-year-old nag . Desperate , " Iron Gustav " resolved to recoup his fortunes by setting out for Paris , a 665-mile drive , selling postcards to the curious along the way , and displaying a sign which read : <P> " Berlin-Paris by the oldest hackman of Wannsee a Berlin suburb , who had the honor of making his last voyage in Fiacre 120 from Berlin to Paris because horses are destined to extinction . " <P> Other old men have performed stunts to sell postcards . But here and there an old man or a young is destined to seem to everyone especially nice . By the time he reached Paris , last week , " Iron Gustav " Hartmann seemed as nice as " Trader Horn , " with just a dash of Lindbergh . <P> Joyously the Latin Quarter students , who make it a prankish point to always use fiacres instead of taxis , assembled 39 of their favorite and seediest cab drivers at the Porte de Pantin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in last week . For the rest , Tout Paris is ever ready to join in good-humored shouts at a spectacle so nice as a parade of 40 old men and 40 old nags up the Champs Elysees and on to the Eiffel Tower . <P> How deeply the hearts of Frenchmen were really stirred was shown , when " Iron Gustav " voiced a modest request to be received by Prime Minister Raymond Poincare-a request which was totally ignored . <P> Only Germans took the affair to heart . Cabby Hartmann was royally banqueted at the German Embassy in Paris . In Berlin the Tagliche-Rundschau , organ of the Nobel Peace Prize Winner Dr. Gustav Streseman , famed German Foreign Minister , declared : " The common people of France no longer feel that animosity toward Germans so long and artificially promoted by French politicians and the press . " Observers who know the tenacious French mentality in regions which have been devastated by tramping Teutons were unimpressed . But enough postcards have been sold ( 50,000 ) and enough more will be sold to enable Cabby Hartmann to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good , plain , honest man , he wrote to his wife , last week , <P> " Send me some of our black bread . This white French bread makes me sick . "
