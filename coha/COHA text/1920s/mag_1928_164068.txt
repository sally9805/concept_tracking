The Mayor-elect of Seattle went to Manhattan last week , arriving just too late to hear what the Mayor of San Francisco said to the Mayor of New York . Mayor-elect Edwards was there to inspect public utilities . Mayor Rolph of San Francisco was there on a holiday , with his high boots tucked under his trousers ( as always ) and wearing the first straw hat of the season . Just before Mayor-elect Edwards arrived , Mayor James J. Walker left town , as usual to make a speech . <P> Mayor Walker went to Atlanta and there met many other politicians-U . S. Senators and Representatives , the Governors of Georgia , Alabama and South Carolina . A monster parade blared along Peachtree Street . Then there were special trains to take everyone out to the foot of Stone Mountain , 18 miles from town . It was the 63rd anniversary of General Lee 's surrender at Appomattox , and part of the monster memorial sculptures to the Confederate Armies , carved first by Gutzon Borglum , later by Augustus Lukeman , were ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big speech and accept the memorial for the nation partly because he had helped raise the money , partly because friends of Governor Smith were influential in the memorial association , partly because James John Walker , regarded as a " wisecracker " at home , is accounted a popular orator in the South . <P> To draw away a Confederate and a Union flag from the towering figure of Lee on his favorite warhorse , " Traveler , " another New Yorker had been taken to Atlanta . This was small , grave , smooth-cheeked Robert Edward Lee IV , aged 5 , whom everyone asks if he is going to be a soldier like his great-grandfather when he grows up . <P> Gazing with wonder at the granite mountain in front of him , the boy did as he was told , and at the proper moment , gave a signal . Carrier-pigeons fluttered out of baskets to take the news to all the States . The flags on the mountain parted . Still veiled , but not obscured , by an April mist , the gigantic figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on the plain 200 ft. below . <P> " Magnificent . . . the last of the Cavaliers , " said the speaker ( Judge Marcus W. Beck , of Georgia 's Supreme Court ) , who accepted the statue for the South . <P> Mayor Walker , accepting for the nation , speaking extemporaneously , said : " Lee was the only man in whom God coupled the saint and the warrior . Long after the pyramids have crumbled , his figure , like his memory . . . still will be here . " <P> <P> " Swap generals with us and we 'll lick the hell out of you . " In this threat , shouted across trenches by boys in Blue to boys in Gray , lies perhaps the greatest tribute to General Robert Edward Lee of Virginia , the soldier who retreated his way to the forefront of military history .
