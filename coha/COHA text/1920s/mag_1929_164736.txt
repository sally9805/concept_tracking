Violence strode the world last week . Great storms lashed the Great Lakes ( see p. 15 ) , the stock market crashed historically ( see p. 45 ) , assassin 's guns were pointed in Belgium and Chile ( see pp. 27 , 32 ) . President Hoover , rumbling through Indiana , felt his special train grind to a stop . A sedan had been placed on the tracks at a grade crossing . Secret Service operatives investigated on the spot . Two Negroes were arrested . They succeeded in convincing their captors that , ignorant of the President 's proximity , they had plotted merely to collect damages from the railroad . <P> Innocent though the Negroes may have been , the midwest 's weather was wicked . It rained and blew as the President , after dedicating a monument at Cincinnati , proceeded down the newly-canalized Ohio River . The river steamer Mississippi , especially equipped for the President 's ride to Louisville , went aground , forcing him to embark on the less comfortable lighthouse tender Greenbrier . Whipped by enormous winds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buffeted the President 's craft most disrespectfully . <P> At Madison the Greenbrier paused for the President to receive Indiana 's salute . Only four guns of the 21-gun salute were fired . Damp powder exploded one cannon , killing National Guardsman Robert Earle , injuring three others . <P> Louisville was soggy with rain when the Greenbrier docked there at dusk .

Sportingly he remarked : " If I 'm going to leave a trail of pneumonia behind me in the middle west , I at least ought to go along the trail myself .

The hall where the President spoke was only half-filled with curious spectators who did not grasp the significance of his speech on inland waterway development ( see p. 13 ) . <P> The President cabled President Carlos Ibaez of Chile : " I am most gratified to learn of your fortunate escape from the attempt on your life " ( see p. 32 ) . <P> To the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market slumped . The President 's word : " The fundamental business of the country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis . ... A temporary drop in grain prices in sympathy with stock exchange prices usually happens . ... " <P> Deeply grieved was President Hoover last week to hear physicians despair of saving the life of Senator Theodore Elijah Burton of Ohio , the President 's good friend and campaign supporter , ill for weeks following an attack of influenza ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) . Back from Ohio , President Hoover again visited the dying scholar , statesman , peace-lover , whose interest in waterways was recognized by Rooseveltian appointment to chairmanship of the Inland Waterways Commission 22 years ago . Mr. Burton died full of years ( 77 ) and honor ( see p. 65 ) . <P> Last week President Hoover appointed : Lawyer Walter Ewing Hope of Manhattan ,
