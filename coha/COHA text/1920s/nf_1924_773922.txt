txt // previous examination by Taylor , show that its lower storey was faced with burnt brick , the interior being a solid mass of crude brick . Below this was a projecting ledge of about 4 feet wide , built up in four or five courses of burnt bricks set in bitumen , which was itself based on a platform of puddled clay and crude brick battering outwards to a depth of 5 feet . Below this was a further projecting foundation of unburnt brick and clay . A curious feature of this was that about a foot below its upper surface there was a thin horizontal layer of red clay and black ashes , such as might be left after the destruction by fire of some more primitive structures of timber and clay . The bricks above this level bear the stamp of Bur-Sin ? the son of Dungi  --  indicating a date for the building of the zigurat of about 2390 B.C. , as estimated by E. Meyer . ' These recent researches tend to show that the site was occupied in a pre-Sumerian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tradition that Eridu was one of the oldest cities of Meso-potamia . ' The use of stone for walling is an exceptional feature at Abu Shahrain . The outer wall of the platform on which the temple stands was " composed for the most part of a massive wall of sandstone twenty feet high , backed with beaten clay . " ' This stone was no doubt derived from the sandstone ridge which crops out a few miles on the east of the site . But the inner platform appears to have been revetted to a considerable thick-ness with limestone , the presence of which is more difficult to account for . In the southern part of the site Taylor unearthed a mass of brickwork which was evidently a bastion near the entrance in the south-east wall of the city . It concii. // sisted of two buttresses 8 feet high , but differing in width , with battering sides , portions of which were built up with red burnt piano-convex bricks , ' later additions to each having been made in yellow baked bricks of the ordinary shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal offsets of diminishing width which gave its surface a slightly concave shape . This was part of the town-wall which was continued on either side of this bastion in vertical courses of limestone . Another bastion entirely of stone was found by Mr. Hall about 45 yards eastward in the same wall . // At the eastern corner of the site , within the wall , Taylor excavated the remains of some dwelling-houses . The walls were of sun-dried bricks , lined inside with fine plaster , and rudely decorated with a design of human figures in red pigment . The wall was of beaten clay , and portions of the roofing still rested on the walls . They consisted of fragments of concrete composed of bricks and stones , and had a curved surface indicating that they were portions of a domed covering . ' Though nothing of interest was found within the walls , numerous objects and implements such as hammers , nails , and chisels of stone , and even sickle-like instruments made of baked clay were scattered about in the neighbourhood . ' Similar buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hall in a mound near the north-east gate of the town . The walls here were lined with plaster and decorated with broad bands of white and red colour . WARKA . Of the work done by W. K. Loftus in Mesopotamia , the most important was the planning and partial excavation of the mounds at Warka , the ancient Erech , which lies about 4o miles north-west of Muquayar , not far from the left bank of the Euphrates . From the extent and magnitude of its remains Loftus considered them " alone worthy to rank with those of Babylon and Nineveh . " He describes the impression which the sight of them made upon him . " Three massive piles rose prominent before our view from an extensive and confused series of // mounds , at once showing the importance of the ruins which we their first European visitors ? now rapidly approached . The whole was surrounded by a lofty and strong line of earthen ramparts , concealing from view all but the principal objects . Beyond the walls were several conical mounds , one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each step that we took convinced me that Warka was a much more important place than had been hitherto supposed , and that its vast mounds , abounding in objects of the highest interest , deserved a thorough exploration . " The walls can be traced in a series of mounds forming a kind of irregular polygon about 5 miles in circum ference , with rounded angles towards the cardinal points . In one portion towards the north-east they remain to a height of about 40 feet with a width of perhaps 20 feet , and though on the south-west they have been levelled with the ground , they still show traces of a line of semi-oval turrets , or rather bastions , ( for they are open on the inner side ) about 50 feet apart , with walls of from 4 to feet in thickness . ' The central portion of the area enclosed was a large and apparently artificially made plateau , on which the principal buildings were erected . On this several lofty mounds stand out above the numerous smaller accumu lations of debris which mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apparently one of the oldest , of the structures was found to be the base of a rectangular tower 200 feet square , on each side of which was a massive buttress projecting 7 feet and about 6 feet wide , but divided vertically by a central channel z foot 9 inches wide . The whole was built of sun-dried bricks , on some of which were inscriptions in picto graphic signs repeated in cuneiform. - // The character of the masonry is peculiar : the brick-work is interspersed at intervals of four or five feet with a course of reeds . Upon and under these layers four or five rows of the bricks or tiles are laid flat , ' but others are placed on edge , so that outwardly both flat surfaces and narrow edges are visible . Small oblong apertures , which penetrate the whole mass , are found here as elsewhere . The upper surface of the building is flat , and as the sides batter its area is considerably less than that of the base . There are traces of a brick superstructure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after its original construction . It appears from Loftus 's plan to have stood at the south-west end of a rectangular enclosure , and was evidently the ruins of a zigurat . The most important building at Warka is an immense mass of brickwork standing within a rectangular enclos ure some 300 yards to the west of that just described . The whole area is above 7 acres in extent , having sides respectively 65o and 500 feet in length , with the usual orientation . The building itself is a rectangle of 246 by 174 feet , one end of which coincides with the short south-west side of the enclosure . At the north-east end , on a rather lower level , is a nearly square space which was apparently a forecourt to the palace or temple . Its south-west end and the outer wall on which it stands rise abruptly to a height of 8o feet above the general level of the plain , and above the mound on // which it stands a face of brickwork 174 feet long is partially exposed to a height of 23 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the base of this facade was a pavement 33 feet wide thinly coated with plaster , from which the wall of sun-dried bricks rises perpendicularly . This wall has some special interest because it exhibits on a large scale a probably early // specimen of mural decoration which is peculiar to Babylonian and Assyrian architecture . Its face , except towards the ends , is broken at regular intervals by shallow recesses z2 feet wide extending from top to bottom , each of which has two vertical grooves or channels with doubly rebated edges . ' The spaces between these recesses are about 16 ft. 5 in. wide and are somewhat more elaborately decorated , for the lower half of each has a large panel of seven half-columns in close contact , built of bricks moulded to the required form ; whilst the upper half , separated only by a narrow blank space , has three sunk and rebated panels . The middle one , which is above the three central half-columns , is broader and deeper than the other two , the upper parts of which are filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central panel Loftus mentions that there are two crescents , a larger and smaller one ? no doubt symbols of the Moon-god Sin . On each side of both upper and lower stages is a vertical rebated groove 7 inches deep , travers-ing , like those in the recessed spaces , the whole height of the wall . The base of the wall has no plinth : instead there is a narrow band of plaster i. inch wide which reproduces the original plane surface at the base of the vertical grooves and semi-columns . The whole front has been coated with plaster from 2 to 4 inches thick , but there is no trace of colour . ' The interior of this building was only partially excaCH. // vated . Loftus began at the south-west end behind the face of the wall already described . The wall was so thick that the structure seemed at first to be solid , but subsequent excavation revealed internal divisions similar to those in later Babylonian buildings . The entrance was at the north-east end , though not exactly in its centre , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the farther end was a large hall 57 by 30 feet in area , with its axis transverse to that of the complete building . The fact that the front wall of this and the adjacent rooms was , like the back or outer wall , about 20 feet thick , whilst the side or end walls were much less massive , gives the impression that they may have supported a barrel vault of brick or concrete , but fragments of palm wood , and the existence of holes in the walls about 12 feet above the brick pavement for a portion of the length , indicates that there had been a timber upper floor accessible from below over part of the hall . From the east end a doorway led through a small room into another hall about 38 feet long , which had a larger entrance from the front court . Altogether Loftus traced the walls of about seven rooms large and small , but as he found no decorative features , he did not pursue his investigations . As there are no windows in the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lighted from above , or from apertures at the top of the walls . Another sample of walling which was found close to the building first described ? the so-called Buwariyya demands notice on account of its curious construction . A wall 3o feet long is composed entirely of narrow cones of terra-cotta about 3. ' , inches in length , embedded with the circular base outwards in mortar composed of mud mixed with chopped straw . The bases were only about seven-tenths of an inch in diameter , and some of them being coloured red and black they were arranged in close // contiguity so as to form " various ornamental patterns such as diamonds , triangles , zigzags , and stripes , which had a remarkably pleasing effect . " ' The wall composed of these cones was only fragmentary , but it showed on plan a rectangular projection 14 ft. ro in. wide and z ft. 9 in. deep , though the surface was broken away for a short length near the centre and on each side of this projection a series of semi-cylindrical , or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each pilaster was about 30 inches , except those adjoining the buttress , which were little more than quadrantal in section . Had the remains of the wall extended further , it is probable that they would have been found in series of seven , as on the wall already described , alternating with buttresses , but further trenching failed to bring to light any more remains of building , nor was there any brickwork behind the cones . So far as this application of cones is concerned it may be inferred that // this wall is a rather elaborate specimen of a regular method of decoration , for similar cones were found at Nippur , and Taylor , in his explorations at Muquayar and Abu Shahrain found many scattered cones of larger size lying about . On the site of the " house " which he examined he found a baked clay cone 5 inches long with a small inscription round the base . ' At Abu Shahrain the mounds were " literally covered with conical pieces of baked clay about a quarter of an inch to half an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ; others had a rounded base , like the head of a big nail , and the point curved round. - He found others of marble and limestone from ' l to Io inches long , some of which had the bases coloured black with an inlaid copper ring . Another building a short distance from the south-west wall of the temple or palace enclosure also had a peculiar type of masonry . Upon a basement composed of com pact earth apparently reinforced with crude brickwork was built a wall constructed of unburnt bricks and a peculiar kind of conical vase , the fragments of which lay strewed on the surface . The wall , which was very irregular in plan , with various projections and recesses , was traced for over 15o feet . " Above the foundation were a few courses of mud bricks , superimposed on which were three rows of these vases , arranged hori zontally with mouths outwards , and immediately above each other . This order of brick and potwork was re peated thrice , and was succeeded upwards by a mass of unbaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen inches in length , with a general diameter at the // mouth of four inches . The cup or interior is only six inches deep , consequently the conical end is solid ... . With their circular mouths outwards they produced a very strange effect . " ' The dates of all these buildings remain somewhat uncertain . Loftus mentions that some of the bricks used in the " temple " bore the name Sin-shada , which he assigns to a king of the sixteenth century B.C. , and whom he appears to regard as the builder of the zigurat ( Buwariyya ) .2 But he supposes that they were appro priated as material by a later builder , and from the similarity of the wall decorations above described to walls found at Kouyunjik ( Nineveh ) and Khorsabad he concludes that such walls belong to the seventh or eighth century B.C. But on the other hand , if this were the case , some more distinct features of Assyrian or late Babylonian art in the shape of mural reliefs or enamelled tiles would be expected , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , corroborated by the more recent explorations of Messrs . R. C. Thompson and H. R. Hall , to sanction a much earlier date . Many other sites were partially explored in the middle of the last century by Taylor , Loftus , and Layard , but they do not appear to throw any additional light on the history of this Chaldaean architecture , based entirely on the use of brick , the forms of which are sufficiently illustrated in the foregoing examples . The remains of Babylon itself , and the discoveries in Assyria with which are associated the names of Layard , Place , and Rawlinson as pioneers , belong to a later period . The monument // known as Birs Nimrud , at the ancient Borsippa on the west side of the Euphrates , is the most important example of a zigurat , and may , like those already mentioned at Nippur , Muquayar , Abu Shahrain , Warka , and other places , retain some of its earlier features . But it is known , from stamps on the bricks , and from inscribed cylinders found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nebuchadnezzar II about 600 i3.c. , and therefore adds little to our knowledge of the art of earlier ages . Recent excavations by the German Orient Society under Dr. Koldewey , have brought to light some of the earliest , as well as the latest , remains on the site of the city of Babylon , ' and tend to show a continuous adher ence to ancient forms and methods of building , especially in the structure of temples . But Chaldaea in general , after the decline of the old Sumerian cities , does not appear to have contributed spontaneously anything to the advancement of architecture until after the downfall of Assyria ; when Babylon , under its last dynasty , achieved a world-wide fame , and enjoyed a brief period of splendid pre-eminence . The nature of the soil no doubt placed certain limitations on Babylonian art , which con sisted largely in the ornamentation of walls with skilfully moulded and brilliantly coloured enamelled tiles . The Assyrians , on the other hand , if wanting in originality , were quick to adopt new ideas and skilful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on to other nations with whom their aggressive policy brought them in contact . But before these facts can be duly appreciated it is necessary to consider the effects of a great Anatolian civilization which was contempor aneous with that of Babylon , and not without consider-able effect on the art of Assyria , though its importance has only recently been brought to light . CHAPTER V THE HITTITES THE origin of the Hatti , who are now identified with the Hittites of Biblical history , and who overthrew the first dynasty of Babylon ( ante , p. 19 ) in or about the eighteenth century B.C. , is still uncertain . By some ethnologists they are assumed to be a branch of the so-called Mediterranean race which formed the basis of the population not only of the Aegean coasts and islands , but also of the north coast of Africa and of the peninsulas of southern Europe . ' That Crete and the other islands of the Aegean archipelago were originally colonized from the south-west coast of Asia Minor is geographically very probable , and is supported by similarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cult and symbolism . The only fact , however , that can be regarded as certain is that the Hittites were not a Semitic race . But between the raid made on Babylon ? which at the latest was in the middle of the eighteenth century B.C. ? and the beginning of the fourteenth , when a powerful Hittite government is found seated in the centre of Asia Minor , there is no documentary evidence to show how they rose to power or attained to the comparatively high level of culture which is evident in their monuments . // But , as is not unusual , archaeological research has some-what illuminated the obscurity . At a site now known as Sakje-Geuzi , on the eastern side of the Taurus range , where northern Syria is merged in the Anatolian penin sula , recent excavations have disclosed the growth of a local culture , extending continuously from the neolithic age to the period of Assyrian domination in the eighth century B.C. Implements of flint and obsidian , with fragments of black pottery similar to some found at Troy , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst at a higher level occur shards corresponding to some of the age of Naramsin found at Susa . But the larger part of the fragments found are without distinct resemblance to any observed elsewhere , and indicate some unknown relation in ceramic art which seems for many ages to have been developed in-dependently . ' Even in the later and more developed arts of sculpture and architecture there are obvious signs of native independence and originality which were not without a far-reaching effect on the art of other lands . After the raid on Babylon in the eighteenth century B.C. the Hittites do not reappear in history until some three centuries later , when the discovery of the Tel-el-Amarna letters at the palace of Amenhetep IV ( Akhen aten ) on the Nile shows . that in the middle of the fifteenth century they had become a power in Western Asia . " // Their chief city was then in the centre of Asia Minor , some miles east of the river Halys , where its course turns northward to the Black Sea . The site is generally supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Croesus about 56o B.c . It is now known by the name of the modern Turkish village of Boghaz-Keui , which partly trenches on its site . ' But before their political power had become ? for a time  --  con centrated here , it is evident that the Hittite race was spread over a vast area in Asia Minor and Syria , the more populous portion of which was farther south , near the Taurus and Anti-Taurus ranges . Here , at least , seems to have been the focus from which their culture was diffused . Their early settlement at Sakje-Geuzi has been mentioned ; within a few miles on the south is Sinjerli , the site of a fortified city with many Hittite monuments . Such , also , is Maraslt on the north , a hill-town , on the eastern slopes of Taurus . Far to the north-east on the upper Euphrates is Malatia , and much lower on the river , where it approaches Mesopotamia , was Kar chemish , which in later days became a second Hittite capital . On the western side it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fraktin on the north-west , on the way to the Halys , is noted for some remarkable and apparently very ancient rock-reliefs , and at Ivriz on the west there are others equally remarkable , though later in date . A fortified . Hittite post known as Giaour Kalesi lies on what seems to have been a main road between Pteria and the western coast of Asia Minor , and the well-known figure on Mount Sipylus , with some sculptured reliefs at Karabel in Lydia indicate that // Hittite culture had extended its influence almost to the Aegean seaboard . ' Most of these sites and many others not yet explored were probably in primitive times the settlements of various tribes of the same race leading a semi-independent existence with occasional combina tions for warlike purposes ; and it may be supposed that it was an alliance of some of the more eastern clans , under a leader more powerful than the rest , which effected the raid on Babylon and expelled the degenerate successors of Sumuabu and Hammurabi . Though the illegibility of the pictographic inscriptions which occur on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably conceals the names of kings or chieftains , the discovery at Boghaz-Keui of a hoard of tablets inscribed in legible Babylonian cuneiform writing ? which supplements in a remarkable way the similar collection found at Tel-el-Amarna threw a sudden light on the history of the Hittites and other neighbouring nations between the fourteenth and twelfth centuries B.c . When their metropolis first comes into historical view it was probably the largest city in Asia Minor . The remains of its walls form a circuit of about 3 miles . Here the king Hattusil , and after him his son Subbiluliuma , who was dignified with the title of " the Great King , " had their palace , and the seat of a widely extended government . A hundred years before this their outlying dependencies in Syria had been threatened by Egypt , for the powerful pharaoh Thothmes I had extended the boundary of his empire , at least nominally , as far as Karchemish on the Euphrates ; and there had been repeated conflicts between troops in the // service of Egypt and the Hittite inhabitants . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay between the two great rivers on the north of Babylonia , was continually encroaching on the neighbouring states , and was the more to be feared as their king , Tushratta , was allied by marriages with the rulers of Egypt . Subbiluliuma 's first efforts were directed towards making himself secure on the east and south-east , and though the records are obscure , it appears that he reduced the smaller principalities on the north of Syria to vassalage and overran Mitanni , if he did not actually subjugate it . In the resulting confusion Tushratta was murdered and his kingdom fell into a state of anarchy and impotence . Some years later Subbiluliuma was appealed to by Mattivaza , Tushratta 's son , and was induced to relieve the desperate condition into which Mitanni had fallen . Mattivaza was restored to his position as king , received the daughter of Mursil , Subbiluliuma 's son , as his wife , and a treaty was concluded by which Mitanni became a protectorate of the Hittite king . Of any exploits of Subbiluliuma on the west there are no legible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aegean coast lands show that Hittite influence extended far in that direction . At his death " the Great King " left a wide but apparently loosely compacted empire , which included a great part of Asia Minor , and dominated all Northern Syria and the northernmost part of Mesopotamia . It had now attained its culmination , and Subbiluliuma 's sons , Arandas and Mursil , had as much as they could do to maintain it . Pacific conditions prevailed for a few years on account of the weakness of Egypt under Amenhetep IV , who gave more attention to domestic matters and religious reform than to the outlying portions of his 6o WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE cll. v empire . To this period may be assigned a more rapid development in the arts of peace , the growth of cities , and improvement in monumental art . The building of the first palace on the lower ground at Boghaz Keui is conjecturally attributed to Mursil , c. 1330 B.C. But this comparative tranquillity was not of long duration . The accession of the Ramesides in Egypt was accompanied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under Seti I the Egyptians again overran Syria , whilst the Assyrians , who had now become an independent and aggressive power under Shalmaneser I , drove the Hittites from their dependencies on the east of the Euphrates and , crossing the river , gained possession of Malatia . Mursil and his son Mutallu had to exert themselves to the utmost to maintain the independence of their dominions . The Assyrian aggression was stayed for a time , but Seti 's son and successor , Rameses II , a young and ambitious prince eager for military renown , was determined to re-establish firmly his empire in Syria . The critical position of the Hittites in North Syria was obvious , and the approach of the Egyptian army was the signal for a general and united rising on the part of the whole confederacy . The names of allies and dependents who flocked to Mursil 's camp not only from the regions bordering on Syria , but even from remote western districts of Asia Minor , are evidence of the wide extent and influence of the Hittite race . The opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned in the ancient annals of the East ( c. 1290 ) . The result , however , was not decisive . Rameses himself was at one time nearly surrounded and captured , but the numbers of the Hittite host were probably counteracted by the superior experience and unity of the Egyptians . By swift and resolute tactics Rameses managed to extricate himself , and finally the // most effective portion of the Hittite army was driven from the field . They were not , however , pursued , and the losses sustained by the Egyptians induced them to grant a truce . The result of this inconclusive conflict was in the end disastrous to the Hittites , who lost some of their chief leaders and the support of their Syrian allies . Mutallu , who had now succeeded his father , made efforts to retrieve the position with only partial success , and died whilst still at enmity with Egypt , c. 1280 . ' He was succeeded by his brother Hattusil II , who ap-pears to have been a resolute and politic prince . During a reign of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent the prestige of the Hittite kingdom . Rameses was satisfied to maintain his hold on Southern Syria , and after some years ( c. 1271 ) a solemn treaty of alliance , offen-sive and defensive , was con-cluded , with much ceremony and religious sanction , between him and Hattusil . The period of tranquillity ( c. 1271-1200 ) which ensued was favourable to the prosperity of the Hittite dominions . Sakje-Geuzi , Sinjerli , Hamath , Aleppo , and Karchemish in Northern Syria ; Marash and Komani in the moun-tainous regions of Taurus and Anti-Taurus , and Malatia near the Upper Euphrates all increased in importance and advanced in culture . It seems probable that to this // period must be assigned the famous rock-reliefs at the hypethral sanctuary of Iasily Kaya , near Boghaz-Keui , as well as those at Giaour Kalesi , which lay on the main road from Pteria to the west . The single figure of the Hittite war-god at Karabel in Lycia belongs to the same phase of art and may , with another similar figure near it , which has fallen from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the western regions of Asia Minor . Hattusil was duly succeeded by his son and grandson , under whom the Hittites maintained some ascendancy in Western Asia and remained on peaceful terms with neighbouring states . There is a record of a Hittite king , probablyDudkhalia , the son of Hattusil Ii , havingvisited Egypt in 1258 B.C. , a circumstance which can not have been without some effect on his appreciation of art , and which was probably reflected in the general culture of his subjects . But about 1200 B.C. occurred one of those sudden and unexpected upheavals which characterize the early history of nations , in the shape of an irruption of an alien race from the north-west . They are known in ancient records as liuski , and are generally assumed to be akin to the race which some three centuries later invaded Asia from the south-east of Europe , and eventually settling in the centre of Asia Minor became known as Phrygians . These Muski appear to have penetrated as far as the Assyrian frontier , and on their way to have captured or sacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hittites disappear as a dominant power in Asia Minor , and the invaders , for a time , took their place . But they had the growing power and ambition of the Assyrians to contend with , and after an intermittent struggle which lasted for fifty years , the Assyrian king , Tiglath Pileser I ( c. 1110 ) drove them from the smaller settlements or principalities on the west of // the Euphrates , and stayed any further aggression . ' In these conflicts the Hittite population , who were no doubt enlisted against the Assyrians , were the chief sufferers , but there is no evidence that they were permanently dispossessed , and the general course of their history indicates that the Assyrians withdrew from the west side of the Euphrates , and that the Hittites obtained for a time a fresh period of prosperity , if not of absolute independence . The rebuilding of the ruined palace at Boghaz-Keui and the reinstatement of the fortifications and gates , which are assigned to this period , may be regarded as evidence that some local independence was regained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hittite influence lay for the future in the south-east of the former empire . The city of Karchemish seems , since the first inroad of Tiglath Pileser , to have escaped further disaster . It is probable that it had always been the chief town of a semi-independent state , governed by kings of its own , and after the fall of the dominant dynasty it became the chief seat of what survived of Hittite culture . The remains of the city which have been partially excavated are evidently monuments of a prosperous and highly cultivated people , and though there is evidence in later work of Assyrian influence , it retains a peculiar character testifying to a genius for art , which so far as originality is concerned , compares favourably with that of the Assyrians . This interval of comparative prosperity coincides with a temporary decline in the power of Assyria , and seems to have lasted for about 125 years ( c. 1010-885 B.c . ) . But the Assyrians , under Ashurnazirpal III and // Shalmaneser II , again became violently aggressive . The latter made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tarsus in Cilicia , and afterwards defeating a retaliatory attack which was made by a combination of Hittite states . Further aggressions , however , were stopped by another power , which now comes upon the historic scene , namely the hardy and warlike race of mountaineers from Urartu ( Ararat ) and the neighbourhood of Lake Van , who not only invaded Assyria , but even crossed the Upper Euphrates and for a time held Hittite territories in subjection . The history of this part of Asia for a large part of the ninth and eighth centuries B.C. is obscure . It apparently consisted of a long-continued struggle for North Syria between Assyria and the Vannic kings , under whom some of the Hittites served , and though a few states strove to preserve a nominal independence , they became politically of no account . The final dissolution of the once extensive Hittite empire was accelerated by the invasion of the Phrygians who are supposed though definite evidence is wanting ? to have entered Asia from Europe by way of the Hellespont . In 877 Karchemish was taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native rulers for about 160 years longer . In 743 Tiglath Pileser IV defeated the King of Urartu , and one by one the Hittite states who still held out gave in their submission . At length , in 718 B.C. , Karchemish surrendered to the Assyrian king Sargon . Marash , the last Hittite stronghold , fell in 709 B.C. CHAPTER VI IIITTITE ARCHITECTURE OyyING to the illegibility of the pictographic inscriptions which are found on many of the Hittite monuments it is difficult to correlate them with the history which has been outlined in the foregoing chapter . Of the earliest dwellings of this widely spread race it is impossible to give any account , as no vestiges of them have yet been noted even in sites such as Sakjc-Geuzi , which have been inhabited since neolithic times ( ante , p. 56 ) . Their methods no doubt varied in accordance with peculiarities of soil and situation , but it is evident from all the sites which have been explored , that unlike the Chaldaeans , whose architecture was based almost exclusively on the use of hardened plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ stone constructively as well as for monumental and religious purposes . Some of the earliest masonry as yet met with appears to be that found in the ramparts and walls on the higher portions or acropolis of their chief city at BoghazKeui . They date possibly from the early part of the second millennium B.C. , or even earlier , when the settlement was probably that of a sept or clan of the indigenous Hatti . On the south side , which had something of the character of an elevated tableland , the site was protected by a natural ridge strengthened artificially , but towards the north the ground fell rapidly to a plain 67 // which lay 87o feet below the summit . On this side the higher ground was protected by several craggy eminences which were further strengthened by stone walls . The east and west sides were defended by small but rapid streams , which formed a junction on the low ground on the north-west . That on the east flowed through a deep ravine with precipitous sides , one of which was crowned by the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fortified ridge or rampart which protected the south side of the high ground formed a roughly semi-circular line , the diameter or chord of which was about three-quarters of a mile from east to west . As a much stronger and more elaborate system of fortification was adopted at a later date it is difficult to ascertain the nature of the original work . But the character of the earlier masonry is shown in the strongly buttressed wall which protects the north side of Beuyuk Kaleh . ' It is built of ponderous stones mostly squared , but in some cases polygonal , which in the lowest courses are from 2 to 3 feet in height . This use of polygonal blocks fitted with some neatness amidst rectangular courses is seen in other walls of less massive construc tion . The central eminence , known as Sari Kaleh , had less need of artificial protection as its north side is precipitous , but towards the west side there is a smaller rock known as Yenije Kaleh , surmounted by a rect angular fortification , built in more regular courses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that this hill-town had already emerged from an isolated condition , and been extended in area before the time of Hattusil I , and that under his son , // Subbiluliuma , it had become the capital of an extensive confederacy of Hittite clans . At thevillage of Eyuk , about 20 miles north of Boghaz-Keui , there is a small fortified hill on which are found remains of ancient walls of rough and partly polygonal masonry ; and remarkable sculptures of later date , which attracted the attention of various travellers in the course of the last century , showed that it shared in the rise of its more important neighbour . ' Similar fortified sites , undoubtedly Hittite , and prob ably as ancient , are widely distributed in Asia Minor . At Giaour Kalesi , some distance westward of Boghaz-Keui , is a rocky eminence dominating a narrow pass on what must have been one of the main trade routes from the interior of Asia to the Mediterranean . It is crowned by a fortification enclosing a rectangular area of 112 by 54 feet , the masonry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supported at a lower level by a revetment of larger stones pentagonal in form . Its Hittite character is proved by sculptured reliefs near the entrance . At Karaburna on the Halys , about 90 miles due south of Boghaz-Keui , there is a fortification on a steep hill about 380 feet high . Round the summit runs a wall of sheer rock broken only on the west and north , where there are remains of rough stone walling . On the east side , below what was apparently the gateway , was an underground passage , now blocked up , which may have led to a well . On the left side of the gate is an inscrip tion in Hebrew characters . Still farther south , at the limit of the central tableland , 7o WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE CH . VI is Kara Dagh ( the black mountain ) an outlying spur of the Taurus 7,000 feet above sea level , and at least 3,000 feet above the plain . On its summit are some Hittite works and inscriptions which indicate that it was a sanctuary or " high-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a rocky hill known as Kizil Dagh , rising abruptly from the plain to a height of nearly 400 feet , the summit of which is fortified . Near this entrance on the west is a long Hittite inscription . ' At Fraktin , farther east , where Anti-Taurus hems in the central plain , there is a series of rock-sculptures in relief of a very primitive character . They appear to represent scenes of religious ceremonial and suggest that here was a sanctuary of early date . A more remote Hittite site is found at Malatia , near the Upper Euphrates , which was probably always - the seat of an independent government . Here some of the sculptured reliefs , undoubtedly Hittite , have a certain crudity of character which distinguishes them from others that arc obviously later , and associates them with the earlier relics of the Hittite population . A similar antiquity is assigned to a few of those at Sinjerli in Syria . ' Whether the figure on mount Sipylus , near the Aegean coast , // mistakenly called Niobe , which was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this early epoch is uncertain . The fact that all Hittite sculptures appear to be cultural in character , and that this almost certainly represents the primeval mother-goddess unac companied by any of the later divinities to which her cult gave rise , seems in favour of its early date . The process by which the site of the Hittite capital emerged from its early phase as a highland fastness , and became the chief town of an extensive confederation can only be inferred . A hoard of inscribed tablets discovered in the ruins of a building on Beuyuk Kaleh , the date of which must be somewhere about the fourteenth century n.c. , shows that it was by that time a central seat of power , and implies that there was a royal palace at that spot . This will account for a wall which runs from that fortified point in a north-westerly direction to join the town wall on the west . It follows , and is approximately parallel to , the course of the Kislar Kaya rivulet , which rises in the centre of the enclosed space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the modern village . But the construction , later , of a much larger palace ( though by some it is regarded as a temple ) , the founda tions of which remain on the north of the Kislar Kaya rock , must have necessitated a further extension of the enclosed area ; and there are remains of walls , forming a salient on the north , which marks the limit ultimately attained by the fortified city , and shows that it had an axial length from south to north of about a mile and a quarter . But there is reason to suppose that the first building on the site was wholly or partially destroyed // by fire and afterwards rebuilt ; ' so that the greater part of the remains must have been later than the Muski invasions ( c . LOO B.c . ) . The disturbed condition which prevailed between the death of Subbiluliuma and the treaty between Hattusil II and Rameses can not have been favourable to the progress of art , and it seems likely that the first lower palace was built after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given peace to the land . To this period also may reasonably be assigned the more // scientific fortification of the upper town or acropolis , by strengthening the southern rampart ( sec p. 66 ) . It can not be doubted that the defences of a city which retained considerable civic importance until the middle of the sixth century B.C. must have been fre quently renovated , and it may not be possible to say when the upper wall , with its innumerable buttresses or solid turrets at short intervals , was first erected . In this respect it is a form of military architecture which pre vailed throughout Western Asia , and even in Egypt , // from a remote period . Such turretted walls are found both in early Chaldaean and in late Assyrian buildings , and throughout Asia Minor from Troy to Sinjerli . It is in the gateways that features are found which seem to be peculiarly Hittite . At the extreme south of the town-wall , at a position known as YerKapou , was a gateway surmounted , it is supposed , by a tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible on foot , it was not without some distinctive features . It consisted of an outer and an inner doorway ; the former had on each side a sphinx-like figure , but they are so dilapidated that their features and complete form are now lost . The inner doorway also had two sphinxes , looking towards the outer gate ( p. 73 ) ; these also are much dilapidated , but enough remains of that on the west side to show that they were human-headed and winged , and that whilst they resemble in general form the winged bulls and lions familiar in Assyrian portals , they have been carved with some skill and seem to represent a more refined phase of art . ' // As the natural ridge on which the wall at this part stands is of considerable height , the door was only approached by means of two narrow stairways which slope up diagonally from the east and west , and , without ( see p. 66 ) meeting , converge towards a platform outside the door . Another curious feature is that below the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town by a subterranean passage which penetrates the natural ridge on which the upper wall is built . ' Though lined with heavy stones , it can hardly be de-scribed as vaulted , for the sides slope upwards till they meet , giving the passage a triangular section . The great length and narrowness of the passage allowed of its being easily defended , whilst it might be used as a sally port to repulse from the rear any attack from the south . The more important entrances to this higher portion of the city were two fortified gates , one on the east side and the other nearly opposite on the west , the distance between the two in a straight line being about three-quarters of a mile . That on the west is known as the Lion gate from the two figures in high relief showing the head and forepart of a lion on the outer side of each gate-post . The other , known as the King 's gate , had no guardian figures on the outer gate-posts , but on // the interior on the left-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Hittite warrior . ' The plan of these gateways is typical of others in various sites and seems characteristic of , if not peculiar to , Hittite military architecture . In that with the lion guardians the actual doorway is set back about 13 feet from the outer face of the wall , which is returned at each side , leaving a rect-angular space about 25 feet wide in front of the gate , in which an attacking enemy could obviously be enfiladed . The massive gate-posts project 6 feet from the side walls , so that the actual opening for the gate is only 13 feet wide . Behind this was another space about 25 feet square on the farther side of which a second gate with heavy side posts had to be forced be-fore the fortress could be entered . The depth of the whole work from front to back , about 40 feet , gives the total length of the walls from which assailants would be exposed to side attacks . The form of the upper parts of both gates and walls is to a large extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projecting part of the wall at the sides of the outer gate were the bases of towers which , with the walls and the numerous turrets which strengthened them at intervals , may have been finished at the top with crenellations such as appear on Assyrian repre-sentations . The doorways themselves have been supCH. // posed alternatively to have had a horizontal lintel , or to have been arched on the cantilever principle . ' The curved form of the side posts , however , suggests another alternative , namely , that other curved stones were combined to form a roughly elliptic arch as shown in the restoration by the late Dr. Puchstein . The same plan is found in the palace gate at the neigh bouring settlement of Eyuk , and its wide prevalence is shown by its occurrence at Sinjerli and elsewhere in Northern Syria . The ground plan of Hittite palaces does not differ materially from that of similar buildings of earlier date found in Mesopotamia , which was probably derived from a primitive type prevailing throughout Mesopo tamia , Anatolia , and the Aegean . An open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a feature common to all . ' In the plan of the lower palace or temple at Boghaz-Keui , which is the most important Hittite building of which the remains have been completely disinterred , the arrangement of cellars or magazines in the basement recalls a similar feature at Knossos , though if the Hittite palace was re-constructed after the Muski invasion it must have been at least three centuries later in date than the Cretan magazines in question . The foundations of the lower palace at Boghaz-Keui consist of rectangular stone blocks of sandstone of great size , averaging about 8 feet in length , and 4 in thickness . ' It is impossible to say definitely how the walls were carried up , but a series of small holes in the upper surface 8o WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE cll. vl of many of the stones may indicate the use of a timber framework attached by bolts which would probably be used in combination with fillings of crude brick ; a usual method of construction when small material was employed . ' The total length of the building was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance was in the centre of the south end and consisted of a triple opening as shown by two rectangular bases between the ends of the main wall . This led into a narrow porch , in the back wall of which a single opening gave access between two small lateral chambers to a central court , measuring about 88 by 65 feet , paved with rough stones . On the west side of the court was a long corridor with six chambers behind it , and on the east a series of larger chambers about 35 feet in depth , below // one of which was found a hoard of clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform characters . The north side of the court was enclosed by a portico or colonnade supported by three pillars . The buildings behind this were , no doubt , the more private section of the whole edifice . They have a total depth , including the portico , of about 76 feet , but they extend laterally to only about two-thirds of the width of the whole . They include the largest single room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanctuary of the temple , and a curious // depression in the floor at the north end , about 2 feet square , as the socket for the statue of the goddess ; but it seems unlikely that the largest room should be devoted to this purpose , and it may with equal probability be supposed to be the megaron or throne-room of the palace . The pillars and some of the walls of this part of the building are of granite , instead of sandstone like the rest ; all the stonework is much damaged by fire . On each side of the building were smaller doorways giving access to the interior . That on the east side was divided in the centre by a wall , and led on one side into // an isolated chamber , and on the other into the north colonnade . The doorway on the south-west was also divided by means of a central pier after the manner of Cretan doorways . There are traces of pivots on which the wooden doors turned . In the north-east corner of the central court are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a door at the back or north side . The whole building was surrounded by a paved passage or street , on the farther side of which were numerous parallel cells which have the appearance of magazines , and which also seem to imply some relation with Cretan architecture . All these buildings stood on an artificially levelled platform which , owing to the fall of the ground towards the north , is supported by a lengthy slope revet ted with stone at its northern extremity . The edge of the higher platform is also supported by a stepped revet ment , the upper courses of which are strengthened by joggling the stones , an expedient which indicates a somewhat advanced stage in the art of masonry . ' It is impossible to say in what manner or to what extent the walls were decorated . There are no signs of continuous carved reliefs such as are found at the gate-ways of Eyuk , Sinjerli , Sakje-Geuzi , and elsewhere . The remains of two pairs of sculptured lion-heads , which formed the ends of a rectangular water-tank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the internal fittings . The interior walls were probably decorated with painted designs . But the whole city has revealed little in the shape of sculpture , for nothing that is recognizable has been found beyond the lions just mentioned , those at the Lion gate , the sphinxes at Yer-Kapou , the figure near the so-called King 's gate , and two cubical blocks of granite found on the slope some distance above the palace , each of which shows on one // face a relief of a priest-like figure before an altar , which seem to have served as bases for some religious emblem . It is possible that , as Professor Garstang suggests ( p. 210 ) , the absence of sculpture may indicate a date for the palace anterior to that at which the lion became , as it did in later work , a frequent motive , in which case he would regard the tank and the Lion gate as additions later than loon B.C. ; but the absence of mural reliefs may also be attributable to the proximity of the remarkable series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen on the walls of two recesses or narrow glens in a rocky tract about two miles eastward of Boghaz-Keui . The larger recess opens towards the south and forms a cul de sac with very irregular sides terminating in a rock with a flat face which forms the central point of the whole composition . The vertical walls on both sides display a series of rough panels , mostly about 3 feet high ? though a few are much higher ? and two or three yards in length , formed by dressing off the background and leaving in relief a succession of figures which obviously have a symbolic and religious significance ( see p. 82 ) . On the left hand the figures , 45 in number , are , with few exceptions , male ; on the right hand , numbering 22 , they are chiefly female ; and they are represented on each side as marching in procession towards the central goal at the north end , where the leaders , respectively a male and female deity , appear to meet in greeting . The importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they are about 7 feet in height ; and the figure on the left is represented as standing on the shoulders of two smaller figures , whilst the goddess on the right stands on the back of a panther . To describe them in detail is unnecessary , as this has already been done by Professor Garstang ( pp. 211-241 ) , with many photographic illus // trations . There is one , however , the last on the right-hand side , which has a special architectural interest . It seems to be distinct from the procession which precedes it , being 8 feet in height , and so placed that it faces directly the central point . It represents a priest or king or probably both holding in his hand an emblematic plaque or model representing a priest-like figure standing between two fluted pillars with voluted capitals showing a primitive form of the later Ionic column . ' A similar em-blem with the two columns occurs on a relief in the smaller recess where the figures , though much fewer in number , are in some cases better preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is perhaps not unreasonable to suppose that the nearness of this forest sanctuary to Hatti-town , and the probability that its sovereign lords fulfilled some priestly function within the sacred precincts , may have al-lowed them to dispense , at their gates , with the symbolic imagery designed to give consecration and protection to other towns less closely associated with the unseen powers whom they worshipped . There is no such lack of ornament at the neighbouring settlement of Eyuk . Here are the remains of a gateway which in plan is practically identical with those at Boghaz-Keui , though the dimensions are slightly less . // From the latest excavations ' it appears that the two projecting walls were parts of the bases of two extra mural towers which must have given the entrance something of the aspect of a Roman or mediaeval gate-way . ' As there is no indication of a door in these basements , it is evident that the vacant space must have been entered from above by means of a ladder , as appears to have been the case in the mural towers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions of Boghaz-Keui , have on each the front of a sphinx carved in high relief , showing a female head on the body of a quadruped probably intended for a lion . The head-dress of the figures has sufficient resemblance to a heavy wig to suggest some Egyptian influence . ' ' But the chief differ ence between the gates at Eyuk and Boghaz-Keui con sists in the series of reliefs which , in the former , decorate the large stone blocks forming the lower course of the frontage and the interior sides of the entrance . They have a general resemblance in style to the work at Iasily Kaya , and have obviously some religious signifi cance , but they are less distinctly ritual in character and are more varied in subject . The left-hand corner-stone represents the image of a bull standing upon a pedestal and facing to the left ; the next represents two figures , apparently a king and queen , engaged in worship . Other stones show priests in procession , the former of whom leads a goat and sheep to sacrifice . Another represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder , and on another appear three musicians , one of whom plays a very well-formed guitar . The corner-stone on the right-hand side of the entrance shows a // seated figure no doubt representing the female divinity  --  facing towards the right , whilst three figures on the next appear to be doing homage to her . More figures followed , but the remainder of the carvings on this side are very imperfect . In addition to these front reliefs others cover the lower courses of the side-walls and returns in the approach to the gate . One on the side of the right-hand sphinx shows a double-headed eagle supporting a priestly or royal figure , the upper part of which has disappeared . The same symbol , upholding two figures , is seen on one of the reliefs at Iasily Kaya . Closely in front of this gateway were found what appear to be the remains of an earlier wall which deviates by a small angle from the later alinement . The masonry of this is roughly polygonal , corresponding with early work at Boghaz-Keui . On some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot ing at boar and deer with bow and arrow , which appear to illustrate an earlier phase of art than those in the upper wall . Professor Garstang 's conclusion is that there was an earlier building , probably destroyed in the Muski invasion , and rebuilt like the lower palace at Boghaz-Keui on somewhat different lines . ' Though the region enclosed by the northward bend of the river Halys seems to have been the centre of Hittite power in its prime , there is little beyond these remains at Boghaz-Keui and Eyuk to give evidence of it . It shifted in later days to the south-east , and it is in Cilicia and Northern Syria that the further progress of architectural art is illustrated . The apparent antiquity of some of the sculptured stones found at Sinjerli in Syria has already been mentioned ( ante , p. 70 ) . The German excavations there have done much to illustrate the development of Hittite // art and architecture . ' The site must have been continuously inhabited from an early period in the second millennium B.C. , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a low hill . As the houses increased in number they were crowded together with their unwindowed backs turned outward , forming of // themselves a defensive wall . As the population increased houses were built beyond the original limit , and by the fifteenth century the settlement had grown into a town surrounded by an extended wall , whilst the hill became the acropolis with a defensive wall of its own . ' By the eighth century B.C. it had become an important city with several palaces . It was surrounded by a double wall , probably crenellated , forming an almost exact circle and strengthened with 200 solid turrets. // It is generally agreed that the most ancient sculptures are those at the southern gate of the city , but in that case they are apparently not in their original position . ' They are rude and fantastic in character , showing figures of mixed form such as a human body with an eagle 's head or a lion with a human head . Horse-riders are also represented in somewhat grotesque style , but with characteristics which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the short tunic and conical cap , and the long lock of hair at the back of the head . The main door of the citadel has the usual plan with some difference in the proportions . It is conjectured that in its original form it may date from the twelfth century B.C. , but that it was repaired by Assyrian conquerors at a much later date . The town was used as an occasional residence by Esarhaddon ( c. 681 B.C. ) , and there is a stele set up by him in the central space of the gateway There is a long series of carved slabs skirting the sides and return walls of the interior . These panels amount to 32 in number , all of which are described by Professor Garstang with great minuteness . ' They include male and female figures , and composite beings such as an eagle-headed man , a human-headed lion , another with a bird 's head , a fine figure supposed to represent the Hittite storm-god wielding in one hand what may be a thunderbolt , and many others designed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human figures show characteristic details of Hittite costume , but in some of the subjects , such as that of a warrior in a chariot , or a winged lion with a human head , some Assyrian influence may be traced . There are a few reliefs on the exterior face of the gate , some of which seem to have been obliterated in ancient times . In addition to these mural decorations two pairs of lions // of large size , which must have served as lateral guardians to a gateway , were found , and in proximity to them two female busts in stone which served as a base or pedestal to a column or figure . The type of countenance and head-dress is similar to that of the sphinxes of Eyuk . The architectural history of Sakje-Geuzi , which lies about 20 miles to the north-east of Sinjerli , appears to have been similar to that of the latter , though the site differs in comprising several mounds of which only one has been explored . This consists of a small rectangular eminence about Zoo feet long by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall nearly 12 feet thick , the foundations of which were found 6 or 8 feet below the surface . The wall above the foundations was built of small stones faced with larger blocks , which were roughly fitted together without mortar in irregular courses , and was strengthened at intervals by external buttresses or solid turrets projecting about 3 feet from the wall . The exact position of the gateway is no longer to be traced . Within the enclosure are signs of successive periods of occupation , some of which covered the site of a palace , of which only the remains of the entrance porch have as yet been excavated . These are interesting inasmuch as they show in situ the lions which formed the anterior ends of the side-walls . The head and forepart of each of these was carved in the round , the bodies being represented in reliefs worked on the remaining portion of the stone . These were followed by other stones , continuing the side-walls , which were also carved in relief . The frontage walls also appear to have had a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls was probably carried up in crude brick , which has disappeared and left no trace . It must be noticed that this entrance differs in plan from the fortified gateways of Boghaz-Keui , Eyuk , and the south town-gate at Sinjerli . The contracted passage-way , with its sculptured jambs set back from the frontage line , the central space , // and the inner gateway are absent . The distance between the guardian lions is 23 feet , and on the centre of the line between them is found a pedestal representing a pair of sphinxes bearing on their backs a circular disk which evidently supported a cylindrical column , or , as Pro fessor Garstang suggests , ' a columnar figure which helped to sustain the covering of what was evidently a state entrance to the palace . A certain similarity to a feature in Cretan palace-architecture , especially the grand portico at Phaestos , will be noticed . The edge of the circular disk on which the central support stood is curiously moulded with a band in the form of con tiguous human fingers pointing upwards. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases which have been mentioned , a peculiar Egyptian character . It is unnecessary to make any attempt to specify the numerous relics in the form of mural reliefs and carved or inscribed stones which give evidence of the wide extent of Hittite culture throughout Anatolia and Northern Syria . They are classified , described , and , in many cases , excellently illustrated in Professor Gar stang 's interesting work so far as they had been brought to light at the date ( 1910 ) of its publication . The latest additions to our knowledge of this peculiar art are due to the excavations made for the British Museum on the site of Karchemish ( Jerablus ) in Northern Syria , ' which , from the eleventh century it.c. , became the // most important centre of Hittite culture . The site , on the right bank of the Euphrates , comprises an inner town , the wall of which forms an oval , about half a mile in length , and one-third of a mile in width . It consisted originally of a wall built on a mound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except on the north and the river front , has to a large extent disappeared , but the mound remains 50 or 6o feet in height . There was also an extensive inhabited area on the west and south , protected by an outer wall , rectilinear in plan , which appears to have been double , but is only traceable with difficulty . At the east side of the inner town , immedi ately overlooking the river , is a lofty double-topped eminence which formed the citadel or acropolis , and was approached by a stairway on the south-west T1 , r , summit was surrounded by a wall , and there was a fort , zoo WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE cu . vi erected by Sargon after the fail of the city , on the northern eminence . On the lower ground have been disinterred parts of several gateways in the west and south walls ; one on the river front was the most ornate , and had on each flank a sculptured lion . The most remarkable and interesting feature revealed by these excavations is the long series of carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-walls of external approaches , including the sides of the stairs which led to the citadel , though in the latter case few are left in situ . In some cases the slabs are alternately of limestone and basalt , and appear to belong to the latest work of this class . Examples of earlier and ruder work are also found : but whilst there are details and conventions which stamp them all as Hittite , there is evidence of a new spirit of refinement and grace , which is unmatched by anything in Assyrian work and approaches in sentiment to the later art of classic Greece . Though these recent excavations have not been published in sufficient detail to allow of methodical treatment here they will , no doubt , prove in time to be an important link , hitherto unrecognized , in the history of architectural development . For in spite of the evidence of an unavoidable subservience to the conquering power , the strongly marked characteristics of early Hittite art which differs from that of any other race ? prevail throughout the whole of the regions which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sites more remote from Assyrian influence . It is true that the practice of carving stones in high relief was known to the Sumerian rulers of Chaldaea and may have been conveyed westward in prehistoric migrations of the people , but in the hands of the Hittites it assumed a special character . The grouping or posture of the persons represented , and the symbolic nature of their en . vi HITTITE ARCHITECTURE ioi attributes , show them to be in most cases cultural in character . The religious system of the Hittites is still in an inferential stage , and without the literary cor roboration which the interpretation of their inscriptions may still supply . But many of the monuments lead to the presumption that it was like that which prevailed in the Aegean , originally based on the worship of a single supreme female deity ; and though it was afterwards developed by the introduction of subordinate divinities , it had no original connexion with the complex mingling of Sumerian and Semitic local cults which is found in Mesopotamia in the earliest historic times . Hittite art has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obviously in the costume of persons repre sented . The high conical head-dresses are peculiar in form , and the hair appears in a pendent lock at the back of the neck . Warriors wear short tunics ; only priests or kings are represented in long robes . The shoes have almost invariably turned-up toes , a singularity which is not found elsewhere in contemporary art . In many cases there is found an exuberance of fancy , as in the reliefs at Eyuk , rare in work technically so crude and primitive in drawing , which precludes the idea of its being merely imitative . There are certainly not wanting indications of Egyptian influence , as in the attitude of the figure at Karabel , with the shoulders fronting and the head in profile . The outstretched wings which cover the priest or king in an emblem which occurs twice at Iasily Kaya , and is found elsewhere , ' are another instance . The sphinx is also found with features which inevitably suggest Egyptian prototypes . The rock-carved figure on Mount Sipylus , in its dilapidated con dition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with early Egyptian sculpture , or with the Sumerian art // of Tello . It is very different from anything Assyrian . Almost as much may be said of a figure from Karche mish , carved in the round , of a god supported by two lions , notwithstanding a trace of Assyrian influence in the face and beard . The long processional compositions , on the large scale seen in the two hypaethral grottoes at lasily Kaya , seem to be an original conception , ' and having been imitated later by an Assyrian king may be regarded as the forerunners of much decorative sculpture that is found in later architecture of other lands . " The actual significance of the Hittites in the history of art , or , indeed , in general history , has only been suspected during the last few years , and the rela tions of their culture to that of Assyria still awaits the enlightenment which continued excavation and , above all , the interpretation of their inscriptions will eventually supply . The following chapters on Assyria will , it is hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this interesting question so far as the art of architecture is concerned . CHAPTER VII ASSYRIAN HISTORY THE origin of Assyria , which was destined to play such a preponderating part in the history , if not in the civilization , of Western Asia , is still obscure . All that can be positively stated is that the kingdom of Assyria grew out of the town of Assur , which was situ ated on the west bank of the Tigris , opposite the region which lies between two tributaries , the lesser and the greater Zab . ' That the population in very early times was Anatolian is inferred from the names of two of the first recorded rulers , viz. , Kikia , the first builder of the town-wall , and Ushpia , the founder of the temple of Ashur , the tribal god from whom the town was named . This inference agrees with that of anthropologists who find in the physical type of the Assyrians a mixture of Anatolian , Armenian , and Semitic elements . It may be noted also that the city of Nineveh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ninua ) . ' The Semites , who formed the most important element in the later race , are supposed to have wandered , like the Babyloni ans , from Arabia , through Syria and entered Mesopo tamia on the north . They were racially cognate with the Babylonians , though generally hostile to them . io6 WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE cH . VII Beyond some historical records on tablets of the later kings , little is known of them before the middle of the second millennium B.C. That a state existed with some sort of independence from the earliest years of that millennium is evident from records which relate to the history and restorations of the temple of Ashur . But it is probable that , as in the Sumerian states of lower Mesopotamia , its power and influence fluctuated and its actual independence was not continuous . However this may be , some of the early chiefs of Assur were certainly vassals of the kings of Sumer and Akkad , 2 and though one of them is said to have opposed Sumuabu , the founder of the first Babylonian dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reckoned on the stele of his laws as cities of his kingdom . In the fourteenth century B.c. it appears from one of the Tel el Amarna letters , addressed to Amenhotep III , that the king of Mitanni had some control over Assur , but this also appears to have been of short duration . The first considerable king of Assyria was Shal maneser I ( c. 1290 B.C. ) , whose expedition across the Euphrates into the Hittite dominions has already been mentioned ; and from this time Assyria appears in history as a restless , warlike , and aggressive state , becoming in the course of six centuries the greatest military power in Western Asia . Shalmaneser was // followed by Tukulti Ninib ( c. 1250 ) , who attacked and temporarily conquered Babylon , where the ancient Kassite dynasty was nearing its end . ' But after a few years , what proved to be a last effort on their part once more set Babylon free , and restored to the throne the son of the conquered king whilst Tukulti Ninib perished in a rebellion fomented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became a prey to internal discord ; but under a new dynasty , of which Nebuchadnezzar I was the most eminent member , retained for more than a century some ascendancy in Mesopotamia . It was not till about 125 years after the death of Tukulti Ninib that another great king , Tiglath Pileser ( c. iizo ) restored the prestige of Assyria . He led expe ditions to the Upper Euphrates and the district of Lake Van , and penetrated North Syria to the Mediterranean coast . But an attack on Assyria by the Babylonians recalled him to Mesopotamia . Babylon was captured and reduced to vassalage ; and from this time , for about 50o years , its history notwithstanding some fluctua tions of fortune ? becomes secondary to that of Assyria . Under Tiglath Pileser the Muski invaders of Anatolia were repelled from the neighbourhood of the Euphrates , and the eastern Hittite lands were freed from these invaders only to become subjects to Assyria , Karche mish alone retaining some show of independence . For the next 200 years no great changes in the mutual relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasties succeeded in Babylon , and for a great part of the time the history of Assyria remains obscure . But under Tukulti Ninib II , who after a reign of six years was succeeded by his son Ashur nazirpal ( 884-860 ) , Assyria again appears on the war-path . Ashurnazirpal ( the third of that name ) was a Io8 WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE cll . VII military genius of the first order , determined in character , relentless in method , and diabolical in his treatment of conquered foes , ' and under him the leading position of Assyria was fully regained . He made a progress of conquest through the territories on the north-cast side of the Tigris , proceeded round the northern limits of Babylonia , through southern Armenia down the Eu phrates , and reducing Karchemish to subjection , pene trated far into Cilicia ; then , crossing the Orontes , he made good his supremacy in north Syria and Phoenicia . He confirmed the results of these campaigns on a return march to the Tigris by the way he had come . ' Apart from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assyria as a great builder . He removed his capital from the ancient metropolis of Assur to Kalah ( Nimrod ) , about 40 miles higher up the Tigris , a military town which had originally been adopted as a residence by Shalmaneser I. There he built the palace which was excavated in the last century by Sir H. Layard . The human-headed and winged lions which guarded one of the entrances , and a number of slabs carved in relief which decorated the interior walls arc now in the British Museum . He also built temples to Ninib and Adar , gods of battle . Ashurnazirpal was succeeded by his son Shalman eser II , who also was a great warrior . It was in an attempt to consolidate his supremacy in Syria that he came into conflict with the Israelites , who were now divided into two kingdoms . This attempt was not wholly successful , for though he succeeded in exacting tribute from Jehu , King of Israel , an event which is commemorated on an obelisk of black stone found at Nimrod , and now in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Syrian city of // Damascus , which was able to retain its independence . But he found some compensation in Babylonia , where , under the pretext of aiding the king to quell a rebellion , he introduced an army , and , after defeating the insur gents , he made the king his vassal . ' After the death of Shalmaneser IL ( 825 B.c. ) a civil war with regard to the succession ensued , and Assyria underwent a period of decline . Later on the rise of a northern kingdom of Urartu ( Ararat ) occasioned a long-continued warfare which has already been referred to. - It may be at this time that Shalmaneser III ( 783-773 ) is recorded to have greatly strengthened the defences of Assur . ' But after the death of his son Ashurdan III ( 763 ) civil war again raged , and led to the loss of terri tories which had been conquered by Ashurnazirpal and to the revolt of Babylon , which had been for some time without a king , but now regained independence under a native ruler ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some of Shalmaneser 's successors to recover the former dependencies , but the continuing and increasing weakness of the government gave rise at last to a military revolt , and the throne was seized by one of the leading officers named Pulu ( Pul ) , , who took the historic name of Tiglath Pileser ( 745 B.C. ) . Under this resolute and enlightened ruler new life was infused into the state and people . The king of Urartu was defeated , Syria was brought into subjection , and the Israelite tribes , Reuben and Gad , and the half-tribe of Manasseh , who were domiciled on the east of the Jordan , zio WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE CH . VII were dispossessed and carried into captivity . Babylon also was again reduced to vassalage . In the period thus inaugurated Assyria attained the culmination of its power and prosperity . For the next 125 years , notwithstanding an almost continuous state of war , her empire , consolidated with the ancient Chaldaean territories of Babylon , maintained a pre-eminence not only in warfare , but also in science and art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confines of Egypt and from Cilicia to the head of the Persian Gulf . Tiglath Pileser was followed by Shalmaneser IV , whose short reign ( 727-722 ) was entirely occupied by wars in Phoenicia and Palestine , in the course of which Hoshea , King of Israel , was his chief opponent . The final defeat of the Israelites , and the fall of Samaria , followed by the carrying away of its inhabitants into captivity , are briefly recorded in Biblical history . ' Shalmaneser died shortly before the final episode , and was succeeded without any interregnum by Sargon , a great military commander , whose origin and claim to the succession are not clearly known . He became , however , the founder of the last Assyrian dynasty , and after him the throne passed from father to son until the final dissolution of the empire . Sargon 's first enterprise was an attack on the Elamites who had invaded Mesopotamia , and in conjunction with a Chaldaean chieftain known as Merodach-baladan successfully resisted Sargon 's efforts to repel them . As a result Babylon fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence , with which for a time Sargon did not interfere . For in the following year he attacked and inflicted a severe defeat on the Egyptian king Shahaka , who was supporting the insurCH. // gent states of Syria and Palestine . And during the next ten years he was fully occupied in continuous war with the king of Urartu , who was supported by the Phrygians , now settled in the former Hittite domains on the west . The eastern Hittites , who still maintained a semi-independence under the suzerainty of Assyria , took the opportunity of repudiating this connexion , but this led to their final conquest by Sargon , and in 717 B.C. the leading city , Karchemish , was occupied and its last king , Pisiris , fled . Sargon 's policy seems , on the whole , to have been the consolidation of his empire , rather than the extension of its boundary . tribes , and maintained his supremacy in Syria and the western Hittite states , he proceeded to settle accounts with Merodach-baladan . He was driven out of Babylon , where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without further difficulty , established his supremacy throughout the whole of Chaldaea . Notwithstanding his continuous wars Sargon did not despise or neglect the arts and amenities of peace . As a builder of temples and palaces he did much to promote the culture of his country . The military town of Kalah which Ashurnazirpal had adopted as his capital did not satisfy him , and he founded a new royal residence , I ) urSharrukin ( Sargon 's town ) , about 40 miles higher up the Tigris . Its ruins , hidden beneath a vast mound of brickdust and the accumulated rubbish of centuries , became in later days the site of an Arab village , Khorsabad , by which name it is still known . Here in the nineteenth century the excavators , Botta and Place , disinterred the remains of a palace , temple , and town wall , which have thrown a brilliant light upon the culminating art of the Assyrians . Sargon , however , did not long enjoy his // creation , for he died in 705 B.C. , two years after its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He appears from his own records to have been a restless and vainglorious person who came into conflict with his neighbours on all sides . Early in his reign the reappearance of Merodach-baladan led to war with , and the severe defeat of , Elam who , as usual , supported the enemy of Assyria . Risings in Phoenicia and Palestine encouraged by Egypt were suppressed . The seige of Jerusalem ( 703 B.C. ) by Sennacherib , when Idezekiah , King of Judah , bought him off with the treasure of the Temple , is recorded in the Old Testament . ' In 699 Sennacherib led an expedition into the hill country on the north-east of Nineveh , and in the following year there was an inroad into Cilicia . For some years after this the king was employed in building at Nineveh , which he made his capital and greatly extended and beautified . His fortifications and palaces were brought to light by'Sir H. Layard 's explora tions at Kouyunjik , the modern village which occupied part of the site . He also repaired the fortifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure-house outside the walls . In 692 B.C. the Babylonians revolted again , having obtained by bribery the assistance of Elam . In the conflict which ensued Sennachcrib , according to his own records , was completely victorious , but as no immediate result followed , the account is dubious . But on the death of the King of Elam in 689 , he determined to put a final end to Babylon , and , making a sudden descent on the city , he destroyed its walls , burnt its palaces and principal buildings , and expelled all but a remnant of its inhabitants . CH. vIIW ASSYRIAN HISTORY zz Towards the end of his reign Sennacherib was again at war with Egypt and advanced as far as Pelusium . It was probably on this occasion that his army suffered the disaster which is described in the second book of Kings ( chap . xix ) , and was forced to retreat by pesti-lence , Egypt thus escaping invasion for a time . There are few records of the last years of Sennacherib , but his death at the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter . Though Sennacherib was hardly to be regarded as a great king , he has left memorials of his reign which give it a special importance in the history of Assyrian culture . He enlarged and re-fortified Nineveh , making it probably , at the time , the most magnificent city in his dominions . On the vast palace which he built the most accomplished art of the period was expended . The number and extraordinary vividness of the sculptured scenes which lined the walls of his state rooms and corridors have illustrated with minuteness the habits , customs , and achievements of a potentate of that time . Sennacherib was succeeded ( 681 B.c. ) by his son Esarhaddon , who had taken no part in the murder of his father , and was the object of his elder brother 's envy and hatred . By energetic action he rapidly quelled the efforts of their supporters , and established himself firmly on the throne . He proved to be a ruler of more statesmanlike qualities than his father , and , with some allowance for the savage customs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanquished . He conciliated the Babylonians by beginning at once to rebuild their ruined city , and gained thereby acquies-cence in his overlordship . Several years of his reign were occupied by wars with the Kimmerians and Scythians , confederacies of tribes from the north-west and north-east who had begun to press downwards , by a sort of elemental impulse , on the 1I4 WEST-ASIAN ARCHITECTURE CH. vii richer and more civilized communities of Anatolia and Mesopotamia . It was not until 672 B.C. that he was able , by a politic combination of diplomacy and force , to check their further advance . ' Only then was he able to under-take what was probably a long-contemplated design , the suppression , once for all , of the intermittent revolts in Phoenicia and Palestine , encouraged by the constant support of Egypt . After securing the submission of the Phoenicians , and of Manasseh , the King of Judah , who had foolishly renounced the more prudent policy of his father Hezekiah , and attempted to revolt and after establishing his authority in the island of Cyprus , he proceeded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time that an Assyrian army had entered the Delta , and the Egyptians proved no match for these practised veterans . After a disastrous battle Tirhaka , the Nubian , who was then King of Egypt , retreated to the Upper Nile , and Memphis fell into the hands of Esar haddon . The latter made no attempt to extend his operations up the Nile valley . He left garrisons in the principal cities of Lower Egypt under vassal kings , and returned to Assyria . But Tirhaka had no intention of accepting defeat quietly . He assembled an army in Upper Egypt , and , descending the river , re-took Memphis and massacred the Assyrian garrison . Esarhaddon imme diately set out again for Egypt , but died on the way . He was succeeded on the throne of Assyria by his son Ashurbanipal a younger son becoming King of Baby lon under his brother . The former hastened to Egypt to carry out the punitive measures designed by his father : and in the result not only was Tirhaka 's army again defeated and the Delta occupied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which proceeded up the Nile , Thebes was induced to surrender without fighting . For // the next four years Tirhaka made secret attempts to stir up rebellion , which were all successfully counteracted . After his death his son , Tanutamon , invaded the Delta in force after taking Memphis and putting the Assyrian garrison to death ( 662 B.c . ) . Once more an Assyrian army led by Ashurbanipal entered Egypt , and drove Tanutamon back to Nubia , and on this occasion Thebes was not spared . The city was plundered , the private houses destroyed by fire , and many of the inhabitants deported ; and though the city , with its vast temple of Ammon , continued to retain its religious supremacy , its political importance was destroyed for ever . For the next ten years Egypt remained in a condition of servitude , under the government of a native prince Necho whom Ashurbanipal , with a view to conciliation , had appointed as viceroy . The power of Assyria seemed now to have attained its zenith . Most of the neighbouring nations were either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irresistible Ashurbanipal . The only irreconcilable enemy was Elam , whose king , probably during the Egyptian campaign , had invaded Assyria . This aggression seems to have prompted Ashurbanipal to a war of extermination . The absence of records renders its progress obscure , but it evidently involved a considerable strain on the resources of Assyria . After intervals of patched-up peace it appears that ten years later ( c. 658 B.c . ) Te-umman , a new king of Elam , made another incursion into Assyria , but was driven back to his capital , Susa , where he was slain , his head being sent to Nineveh as a trophy . But even this was not the end , for enmity between the two peoples continued to smoulder , and proved , in fact , one of the contributing causes to the decline of Assyria which , notwithstanding its outward prosperity , was unconsciously drifting to its doom . // In 648 B.c. the king of Babylon , weary of dependence on his brother , organized a general revolt in which the Chaldaeans of South Mesopotamia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was , however , successfully repressed by Ashurbanipal . The King of Babylon , on the city being taken , set fire to his palace and perished in the flames . The Elamites , too , paid the last penalty . The country was invaded , Susa was again taken and sacked , and Elam finally disappeared as a separate state . ' Ashurbanipal then turned his attention to the west . Having defeated the disaffected Arabs and overrun Phoenicia and Palestine , his army came into contact with the Kimmerian hordes who had made a raid into Asia Minor . These were defeated by the Assyrian generals , and driven back northwards . Having thus re-established his empire in Asia , Ashurbanipal testified his gratitude to his gods by a triumphal pro-cession at Nineveh ( 642 B.C. ) . In one respect , however , he had failed to maintain his supremacy . Psamtek , who had succeeded his father Necho as vice-regent of Egypt , taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Assyrians , had expelled their garrisons with the help of foreign mercenaries and established himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under him and his successors , who con stitute the XXVIth or Saite dynasty , Egypt enjoyed more than a century of prosperity , undisturbed by Asiatic aggression . Ashurbanipal , who for the next ten years was occupied in setting his own house in order , was in no condition to attempt a fresh conquest of a country which , as experience had proved , could only be // held by a continuous military occupation , and it seems probable that the last sixteen years of his life were mainly devoted to those more peaceful pursuits and tastes to which the decoration of his palaces and the vast collection of fictile documents , which formed his celebrated library , bear witness . He died , probably from natural causes , in 626 B.c . ' His death was the signal for the disintegration of his empire . He was followed by three or four weak kings under whom , during the next twenty years , the moribund Assyrian monarchy hastened to its end . It is probable that Scythian tribes from the north-west had already penetrated the upper valleys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the death of Ashurbanipal . They soon overran the whole of Syria and Palestine , and even threatened Egypt . An attack was also imminent on the north-eastern frontier of Assyria , where a Median king , Kyaxares , ' was gathering together a mixed horde of Medes , Kimmerians , and Scyths . In the meanwhile Nabopolassar , who had been acting as governor of Babylon under the King of Assyria , did not hesitate to throw off the feeble yoke of Nineveh . In connivance , probably , with Kyaxares , he assumed royal dignity , and thus became the founder of a new Babylonian dynasty . Kyaxares then , in conjunction with Nabopolassar and the Scyths , struck the final blow . In 612 , after a terrible siege of three years , Nineveh was taken by storm , and if tradition can be // relied on , the last king of Assyria perished in the holo caust of his palace . ' CHAPTER VIII ASSYRIAN ARCHITECTURE JTHE absence of any remains of primitive structures in that part of northern Mesopotamia which ultim ately became the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source for the archi tecture which is familiarly associated with the later Assyrian kings . When the Assyrians first emerge in history as a distinct nation they appear to share the culture of the contem porary communities of south Mesopotamia , and to practise the same methods of building . The peculiarities which distinguish their later architecture appear to result from external influences rather than the evolution of any inborn or original tendencies in art . That their earliest rulers were no less assiduous than the Chal daeans in the building of temples is evident from a few remaining records in the shape of clay tablets ; and the references to the regular repair of these buildings make it evident that they were constructed of the sun-dried bricks which continued to be used throughout Mesopo tamia till the last days of the Babylonian empire . ' It is , in fact , a matter of surprise that they adhered so closely to Chaldaean methods , and failed to make more use of the harder material in the shape of gypsum or limestone which was accessible at no great distance from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some of the earliest architectural work might be looked for is this original seat , the ancient city of Assur , now known as Kalaat Sherkat . Its situation on the right bank of the Tigris , on a rocky bluff where the river was formerly joined by a tributary from the west , gave the city a quadrantal or fan-shaped plan , supplemented , however , by an oblong extension to the south along the river bank . The width of the original enclosure from north-west to south-east was about five furlongs . It was protected on the east side by the river , and a single wall which ran alongside of it has for the // most part disappeared . On the other sides ampler artificial protection was necessary , and as ttie fortifica-tions were strengthened by successive kings in the course of more than 1,000 years , there is little of the earlier work visible . On the curved portion of the perimeter towards the open country on west and south , the wall was at one time doubled , and about its centre there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not quite concentric , gate in the inner line . The principal landward entrance , however , known as the Gurgurri gate , ' was at the north-west angle , and at this point the inner wall diverged to the east with various returns and salients , leaving a space between it and the outer defences which was mainly occupied by a palace built by Tukulti Ninib ( 1250-1243 ) . Of this only the platform remains . At the extreme eastern end above the Tigris was the great metropolitan temple of Ashur , with a large zigurat on its west . Near the centre of this front was another palace built by Ashurnazirpal , and between the two palaces was a temple dedicated to Anu-Adad . There was a third temple of some size dedicated to Nebo on the south side of the inner walls . On the northern front of the city the ground fell in a steep declivity of sandstone rock towards the stream which flowed below to its junction with the Tigris . It is here that the greatest care was continuously expended on strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of wall more than nine feet thick , strengthened at intervals by wide buttresses . It began closely in front of the zigurat , where some of it remains , but slanted halfway down the slope , the lower part of which formed an escarpment . But in course of // time the deterioration of the work and the crumbling of the rock-front necessitated the advance of the wall . The process was repeated from time to time , so that by the efforts of successive kings the fortifications on this side // gradually assumed , and still retain , an aspect which is truly formidable . Towering up , pyramid-like in the background , are the ruins of the great zigurat , in front of which are successive levels of the work of later dates . The time which is covered by all this work is divided by Dr. Andrae into four periods , viz. : ( i ) Archaic , anterior to 1500 B.c. , of which there are some few remains ; ( ii ) Old Assyrian , from 1500 to 1000 , consisting mostly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assyrian , from loon to 722 , covering the reigns of Ashurnazirpal III , Shalmanescr III , and Tiglath Pileser IV ; and ( iv ) Late Assyrian , including the reigns of Sargon and his successors down to the fall of the empire in 612 B.c . The full effect of all may be gathered from the remains shown in the illustration . At the base is the line of a quay formed by Ashurnazirpal on the bank of the stream which originally helped to protect the north side of the city , but which must have dried up before the latest additions of Esarhaddon ( 682-669 ) which lie immediately above it . This portion of the northern rampart is known as the Mushlal , an ancient appellation which was originally associated with the temple of Ashur . Farther west is a still more tremendous defensive work , probably constructed by Shalmaneser I. It consists of a lofty mass of brickwork towering up like a gigantic bastion , with its front divided vertically in receding planes . The lower part appears to have consisted of a plain base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rough brickwork exposed . Above this was a narrow ledge or gangway at the base of the upper mass , the sides of which were relieved by buttresses similar to those which occur at Muquayar and other ancient Chaldaean sites . As in them , too , the surfaces are penetrated by the numerous small apertures which are supposed by some to be intended to ventilate the interior mass of unburnt brick . ( See illustration , p. 120. ) // The north-west extremity of this front , which had been originally the weakest point , was rendered one of the strongest by the for-mation of a terrace for the platform of Tukulti Ninib 's palace , which pro-longed the northern cliff and flanked the easy slope which led up to the wall on the west . ' The first rampart on the south-west side of the city ap-pears to have lain under the inner line of the later double wall . It is only in-dicated now by the vestiges of five large rectangular bas-tions which pro-jected between 6o and 70 feet in front of it , and show signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III when he rebuilt the // existing wall and added an outer one which included the space covered by the projection of the bastions . But the inner wall was demolished by the time of Sargon , and the space gained utilized for houses . The remaining fortification was then strengthened by a low advanced outer wall , about as high as the original escarpment with a passage-way encircling the base of the main wall , an arrangement which is indicated in some of the mural reliefs . ( The south-west gate of this period is shown on p. zo.f . ) The earlier walls at Assur had , as a rule , footings of fragments of gypsum laid on the natural surface of the soil ; but about I2oo B.C. limestone came into use for that purpose . The older walls were always carried up in brick , stone being used only in the facing of escarpments , in hydraulic work , and occasionally in the cresting of . the walls . ' This it may be assumed was almost invariably // in the form of stepped battlements such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by the use of bricks ; but Dr. Andrae illustrates a block of limestone about 2 feet 4 inches high , shaped like a three-stepped gable , which had no doubt formed part of a parapet . ' The stone from portions of these early walls is often found adapted to later structures . The exploration of this , the original stronghold of the Assyrian race , proves that their military architecture was borrowed from , or due to , the same sources as the work of the early inhabitants of Chaldaea , and explains the persistent use of brick even when more durable material was procurable without much difficulty . It is in the domestic architecture , illustrated in the royal palaces , that some newer decorative influences become apparent . Our actual knowledge of this architecture is therefore based almost entirely on the remains of the great palaces which were built by kings of the later dynasties , and of which the work of Layard , Botta , and Place in the earlier half of the nine-teenth century made such a surprising revelation . Perhaps the oldest known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains , described by Layard , ' at Arban , on the river Chabour , which flows into the upper Euphrates from the northCH. // east . It is evidently the site of an ancient Syrian town , and here he found , only partially concealed , two slabs of rough limestone about 5 ; feet high and 42 feet long , on each of which was carved in relief a human-headed winged bull . Further excavation disclosed another corresponding pair forming , with the first , the portals of some palatial building , though its walls had long since disappeared . A lion of about the same size and similarly carved in relief was also found , and the mutilated figure of a man holding a weapon in his right hand and clutching something which had probably re-presented a young animal with his left . All these figures are similar in character to those found on the Tigris sites , and the lion has the fifth leg which is an Assyrian peculiarity . ' They are , coarser smaller in size , coarser and more archaic in execution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belong to an early period of Assyrian expansion such as occurred under Tiglath Pileser I ( c. 1100 B.c . ) . Many smaller objects were found on the site , but with the exception of several Egyptian scarabs apparently of the XVIIIth dynasty , they appear to belong to post-Assyrian periods of occupation . // NIMRUD . Of the larger palaces , the earliest of which any important details remain is that of Ashurnazirpal III , excavated by Layard at Nimrud . ' This town , the ancient Kalah , lies on the east bank of the Tigris , about 40 miles above Kalaat-Sherkat ( Assur ) . Its origin is unknown , but it had been adopted by Shalmaneser I ( c. 1290 B.c. ) , probably for military reasons , as his residence . His successors , however , let the town fall into decay and adhered to Assur as their capital city until Ashurnazirpal , animated , probably like Shalmaneser , by a desire to strengthen his northern frontier , rebuilt the town and made it his chief military station . ' By building for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mural reliefs , executed no doubt with the most accomplished art of the age , he established it as the actual capital of the empire . The mounds at Nimrtid which mark the outer wall of the city enclose an area of about one square mile and a third . Towards the south-west of this enclosure a rectangular platform about 730 yards long by 400 yards wide was built up close to the east bank of the river . It was // ascended from the water side by three inlet ramps or stairways which are now only marked by sloping depres sions or gullies in the sides of the structure , and there was a similar ascent on each of the other sides . The substance of the mound consists of crude brick and rubble , but it was faced on all sides with solid stone masonry . At its north-west extremity is a pyramidal , or rather a cone-like , elevation , about 140 feet high , which is evidently the ruin of a temple tower or zigurat connected with two small temples adjacent to its south-east angle . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Layard , l and from his description it is evident that in many respects it closely resembled those of Chaldaea which have been described . It con sisted of a square base 20 feet high with sides of about 167 feet in length . These were faced by a wall of stone 8 feet 9 inches thick ? the exterior blocks being squared and slightly bevelled at the edges . It was based on the solid rock , but was surrounded by a pave ment of brick , as at Muquayar , Abu Shahrain , and elsewhere . As was often the case the walls on the north and west sides were constructed with buttresses at intervals , but the north side is singular in having a hollow projection semicircular in plan , 16 feet in dia meter , the use of which is not obvious : it may have been connected with the drainage of the structure . The other sides , which were concealed by the higher level of the great platform , were plain . There are indications that they were finished at the top with a continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a solid mass of crude bricks . Upon this base was erected another storey , of which only the ruin remained . It had been faced with burnt bricks , many of which appear from Layard 's description to have been // stamped with the name of Shalmaneser II . ' After laborious tunnelling at the level of this upper floor a long and narrow chamber , running from west to east , was found . It was paved and vaulted with sun-dried bricks , the arch being correctly constructed with voussoirs . In the brickwork of the side walls a course of // reeds , such as occurs at Warka and elsewhere , was noticed . Layard supposed that the chamber might be the tomb of the builder of the neighbouring palaces , but as it was empty there was nothing to indicate its purpose . The amount of debris which covered the base and gave the structure its conical appearance was enough to show that it had probably consisted of several stages and could not have been less than 200 feet high . Ashurnazirpal placed his palace on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its excava tion by Layard revealed a ground-plan which is both smaller and simpler than those of later date , but which illustrates the method of grouping the various apart ments round an open central court which , if we may judge by those which have already been mentioned , and by the more elaborate palaces of Crete in their latest phase , had been prevalent throughout the civilized communities of Western Asia for more than 1,000 years . Its area is approximately a square of about 350 feet each way , and the central court , round which the rooms were placed without much regard to symmetry , measures 120 by 90 feet . ' The usual entrance appears to have been on the north side facing towards the temple zigurat , but the plan shows that there was an imposing facade with three doorways on the west side , where there must have been a terrace above the river . Beneath the palace Layard , in forming a sunken road for the removal of some of the heavy sculptures , came upon a subterranean passage lined with sun-dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its brick vault shows that the proper construction of the arch was a matter of common knowledge . Below the passage was a small drain or watercourse lined with slabs of gypsum . Amongst minor objects was found a bronze ring which had , no doubt , served as a socket for the pivot of one of the large doors of the palace . It is unnecessary to describe in detail the human-headed bulls and lions and other figures of gigantic size which flanked the entrances to this and other palaces , // symbolizing apparently the tutelary divinities to whose assistance or protection the Assyrian potentates habitu-ally appealed . Amongst them is a magnificent lion which was one of a pair at the entrance of the small temple of Ninib at the extreme north of the platform . Nor is it necessary to give any explanation of the long series of reliefs in limestone or alabaster slabs which lined the courts , corridors , and principal rooms of the palace . They are amply illustrated in Sir A. H. Layard 's well-known works . A large proportion of these sculptures have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied in the British Museum . They not only form the most characteristic feature of Assyrian architecture , but also illustrate , with a minuteness which is only rivalled by the mural decorations of Egypt , the character and culture of the people . Ashurnazirpal was succeeded by his son Shalmaneser II ( c. 86o ) , who also built two palaces at Kalah . One occupied the centre of the platform , but its remains are very imperfect . Amongst them was found the celebrated black obelisk , now in the British Museum , giving an account of Shalmaneser 's campaigns , with illustrations in relief of some of the episodes . This palace apparently shared the common fate of the brick-built monuments of Mesopotamia and fell into decay , but was eventually rebuilt and redecorated for his own residence by Tiglath I'ileser IV ( 745-727 ) . ' After another half-century it was dismantled by Esarhaddon ( c. 68o ) , who intended to use its sculptured slabs in a palace which he was building at the south-west angle of the platform . This building , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north-western and central palaces // were found unplaccd , or in some cases were only detached ready for removal . Tiglath Pileser did not confine himself to Kalah as a residence , for he also built a palace at Nineveh of which , however , there seems to be no definite knowledge . Further excavations at Nimrud were undertaken by Mr. G. Smith in 1873 , when he examined with some care the south-east portion of the platform . Here he found the remains of what he supposed to be a private dwelling for the kings ' wives and families . The outer wall at the south end had fallen away down the slope , but the inner walls remained and six chambers in all were excavated . Doors and recesses were flanked by rectangular rebated pilasters , and the walls were decorated with horizontal bands of red , yellow , and green painted on a plaster ground . At the south-east corner , which was curved , a fragment of the outer wall remained . It was coated with enamelled tiles on which was found depicted an armed warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building were found the courses of two drains running eastward . In a square chamber at the south edge of the mound a circular hole in the pavement above one of the drains seemed to indicate a latrine . The bricks were marked with an inscription of Shalmaneser II , which probably shows the original date of the building ; but there are indications of later occupations , and the whole of this quarter of the building had been converted into a cemetery , some of the burials , which were of various dates , being as late as the third century B.c . ' KHORSABAD . It was not until the reign of Sargon ( 721-705 ) more than a century after the death of Ashurnazirpal ? that there was any outstanding work in architecture which , so far , has come to light . The // town and palace which he founded and built on a tributary of the Tigris about 35 miles above Nimrud was anciently named Ddr-Sharrukin ( the city of Sargon ) . but is now generally known as Khorsabad , the name of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries it lay concealed beneath an enormous mound , until the excavation begun tentatively by I3otta in 1844 , and laboriously continued by Place , revealed the plan of a rectangular walled town and the remains of a palace in which the peculiar architecture of Assyria seems to have attained its fullest development . The ground-plan of the palace itself is practically com plete . The entire building is based on an enormous artificial platform about 45 feet high , 350 yards broad , and 38o yards deep from front to back . It was composed of a mass of sun-dried bricks , faced and buttressed with large blocks of squared stone which rose in the form of a low wall round the edge of the platform . Its longi tudinal axis lies , according to the usual orientation , // from north-west to south-east . The front of the building was set a few yards back from the south-east front of the platform and overlooked the whole town from which it must have been approached by one or more stairways , of which some remains are visible , placed parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sides of the palace platform ( PP on plan ) , and is returned round the north-west quarter of the palace , which forms arectangular salient somewhat smaller in dimensions than the portion included in the main quadrangle . The palace building , the exterior walls of which are faced with stone , contains about 210 rooms and corridors grouped round two principal courts , and numerous smaller spaces , and it is not difficult to assign their respective uses to the main divisions of the building . The large court behind the south-east front had its interior walls strengthened by heavy but irregularly spaced buttresses . It could apparently be entered from the town only by foot-passengers , and though it afforded a central means of communication between the various divisions of the building it was probably not used for ceremonial receptions . The usual approach must have been through the large court ( K ) on the north-east side to which vehicles and beasts of burden could have access by means of a ramp ( n ) which led up to the town wall on a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this court probably formed the more frequented part of the royal residence . In a facade adorned with sculpture of winged human-headed bulls and other figures , a central doorway led into a small and very narrow courtyard , which could also be entered by two smaller doors equidistant from the centre . Beyond and parallel to this court was a narrow corridor at the back of which was an open quadrangle ( M ) . This was the centre of the more private residential apartments which were interspersed with numerous smaller courts and
