txt Criminal charges  --  the first to be made since the City Trust Company was closed by the Banking ? Department on Feb. 11 ? will be presented to Supreme Court Justice James C. Cropsey this week . probably today or tomorrow . Justice Cropsey was named by Governor Roosevelt to sit as a committing magistrate in cases arising out of the Moreland act investigation of the failure and its relation to the State ** Department . Justice Cropsey held his first conference with Moreland Commissioner Robert Moses hi his chambers in Brooklyn late yesterday afternoon . Mr. Moses and his aides . Walter H. Pollak and G. Frank Dougherty. discussed the proeedurts ? to he followed and left to prepare criminal- informations which will be the basis for prosecution . ' How many . will he involved in criminal procedure before the investigation is over is not known , but Justice Cropsey no : don &; that more than one person . would be called upon to answer  --  fOr violations ' of the law . He said ** to receive the first of these coMplainta " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoMPlainta Seim . When formal complaint is presented to him , as a committing magistrate , he ' will : issue warrants for the ' accused persons ' ' and ' direct . diem to appear beforeiiim . Then . upOn . the : heals of the evidence presented. , he will decide if a crime has been committed-and hold the accused for further action . If the crime ? is a felony the accused Will be held for the - grand jury : if misdemeanor is charged ' the accused will be held for special.sessions . In each instance Justice ' Cropsey may fix bail . As the City Trust . Com- , pany had branches in both Marihat tan and Brooklyn . Justice Cropsey will sit in whichever ' borough the alleged crime Was committed , he said . He is doing this because . by law , a person must be tried in the county in which the crime ' is committed . and the cases ' will be presented to the grand jury and prosecuted by the District Attorneys of the respective counties . Justice Cropsey does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but will issue the warrants and convene his court at such times as the Information may be laid before him by the . Moreland Commission . Thus he will not be called ' upon to be in constant attendance upon the Moreland Commission hearings . ? His right to sit as a committing magistrate comes . by reason of the power invested in him as a Supreme Court Justice .. Although as a magistrate'his powers are no broader than those of any other magistrate , in his dual capacity his Dower is somewhat wider . He may . for example , cite a witness for ' contempt of court for refusing to answer questions in the Moreland hearings . This action will be by virtue- of his office as a Supreme Court Justice . DI Paola 's Case Discussed . He ' was asked ' if he had been requested to cite Anthony Di Paola , treasurer of the City Trust , for contempt for his refusal tn. answer a question as to his personal wealth at the hearing last Friday . Justice Cropsey said that he had not been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is at stake the welfare of over 25,000 families , many of them utterly ruined by the crash , and if you want to do something good you might try to help them to recover their money . " added , " Di Paola 's name . came up several times during the discussion . " Mr. Pollak in the short conference with Justice Cropsey summarized the evidence developed at the hearings to date . Justice Cropsey was confident that any criminal acts in the case were fully covered by the statutes . He was asked what penalty was provided for ownership of bank stock by a banking superintendent . There bits been evidence that Frank H. Warder , - former Bank Superintendent , held City Trust stock in the name of a dummy . The banking law prohibits this , but does not mention a penalty . " I ant sure that we shall find a general statute covering the situation . " he said . " I have not looked I up the law on that yet . " Asked what action could be taken against the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank department citing twenty-two violations of the banking law , he re-plied : " It is not the failure to act on the letter of the banking department , it is the facts which lay behind that letter , the violations of the law themselves , " he said . But he would not comment on the rPaponsibility of individual directors until he has seen the evidence of their failure to act . They have maintained that they were unaware of the violations ; Di Paola. in his testimony , Insisted that they know of the banking department 's complaint . The clerical and legal work in connection with preparation of criminal complaints will take some time , and while the first is expected within the next day or two it is not ' ikely that all will be ready at the same time . Justice Cropsey will.not have a complete transcript of the hearings of the Moreland commission presented to him , but only those parts which indicate crimes . He will act on these only on specific complaints . " I am not an investigator , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence presented to me warrants criminal action . " It was not until late in the afternoon that Mr. Pollak and Mr. Daugherty came to Justice - Cropsey 's chambers . After they had been there nearly half an hour Mr. Moses appeared and was ushered in . This circumstance indicated that he had been asked to join his counsel at the conference . Mr. Moses had said earlier that he did not expect to see Justice Cropsey during the day , and Justice Cropsey , meanwhile , was at work in his chambers and said that he was waiting to hear from the Moreland commission . Leon Leighton , an attorney for depositors of the City Trust , again addressed a letter yesterday to Governor Roosevelt repeating his request for an extraordinary trial term of the Supreme Court to investigate the Banking Department in relation to the City Trust failure . While paying tribute to Justice Cropsey 's reputation for fearless and independent action Mr. Leighton said that the designation gave him no powers not already ? his as a Supreme Court justice . Mr. Leighton wrote : " I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Attorney of New York County in the prosecution of this investigation . " Mr. Justice Cropsey , in whatever capacity he sits , can do nothing until the evidence justifying prosecution is presented to him . The District Attorney has had all the information in regard to this situation for weeks , and it seems that he is either unwilling or incompetent vigorously to prosecute this matter . I make the direct charge that the Tammany Hall organization is so deeply involved in this banking scandal that the public can not be assured of a fair and thorough prosecution by the District Attorney of New York County , who is an active member of that political organization . John La Greca , a contractor of 241 East 115th Street . secretary of the Harlem Depositors ' Protective Association , wrote to W. Kingsland Macy yesterday telling him that the interests of the 25,000 depositors of the City Trust should be placed above political aims in asking for a wider investigation of the Banking Department . He wrote : " Whatever your political aims are in clamoring for a State-wide investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the Mutual Trust Company the only hope to recover their money . Your efforts to disclose why and how the Mutual Trust Company came into existence would neither bring a single cent more to the depositors nor do any good to anybody .
