txt The committee which has repremted 101 railways in labor and wage egotiations. with the unions was disanded on Saturday . On the same ay sixteen brotherhoods sanctioned a trike against the reduction- of wages n one railway and announced the inmtion of resisting wage reductions on everal other railways . The strike hat has been formally sanctioned ears a double significance . The cornany asked the Railway Labor Board or authority to reduce wages , and the loard instructed the company to toner with its workers before the board rould consider its action . The road rent into receivership and a Federal ourt ordered the reduction that the abor Board refused to consider . This rocedure has the appearance of delining to exercise the authority of he board created under the Transortation act of 1920 for the purpose f hearing and adjusting such disutes . These events are unfortunate nd give the public an undesirable imlression that the roads and the unions re thinking more 4 strategy to put ach other in the wrong before the ublic than to co-operate for the adustment of their troubles under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostilities as seem to be rnpending . The controversy is more ' over rules Fan over wages . The railways might ave been willing to pay the wages I'm ( ' by the Labor Board , and therefore entitled to presumption of reasonableness , if the rules had not prevented the railways from getting the service the wages ought to command . As yet the unions have not answered the companies ' charges that the effect of the miles is to produce inefficiency and Undiscipline ; which increase-operating costs by three hundred million dollars . The unions stand on what - is called the " national agreement , " under which the rules were established by contract with national unions of railway workers . The " national agreement " was not negotiated by the railways . It was enforced upon them by the Railroad Administration as a war measure . When the Railway Labor Board advanced wages it did so with the re , mark that it- assumed the working conditions under . the agreement , respecting which no question had been raised before the board by either party to it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , but that did not give sanction . to the agreement , which by express stipulation ceased when the roads were returned to private operation in March last year . Promptly the unions had asked the railways to ratify anew the rules and the agreement . The railways refused , both collectively and in many cases individually , because . the President had submitted only wages for readjustment . Wages were raised by the board in July , and the question regarding rules and the agreement was not taken up until December . Three months later the question is still unsettled , the board is continuing its leisurely proceedings under the Transportation act , and the condition of the railways is going from bad to worse . In 1920 the roads earned a fraction of 1 per cent , on investment , - if $50,000,000 earnings of 1919 are included in 1920 . They earned nothing net without that *50,000,000 . The roads paid taxes more than fourfold their . net earnings . This is the result of earning gross the largest sum in the history of the companies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreement and the rules is such as the companies assert and the unions have not yet disproved , they are unreasonable and burden the roads and the public S unduly . The board has also-decided that it will not take cognizance of any dispute until after failure of the workers and any individual company to reach an agreement : The companies would be satisfied with the result of individual negotiations , with appeal to the board . But the unions ' last expression is that they are fundamentally interested in the principle of " collective bar " gaining on the basis of organization " recognition through representatives " of their own choosing . " This demand does not come up from the workers , but down from national officers . If that contention should prevail , all railways Must pay the same wages for the same class of work throughout the country , regardless of differences of conditions , and regardless of the prevailing rate of wages . It may be hoped that the Labor Board will speedily find that middle course which is safest .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
