Ladies who sing Elsa in Wagner 's Lohengrin are heavy , Teutonic , have small flare for acting . That a knight should trouble to rescue them is often unbelievable . But at the new Chicago Civic Opera House last week an audience was pleasurably surprised . The Elsa . who came pathetically before the king was slender , lovely , of exceeding grace . That her voice was commensurately light mattered little to those who watched her . She used it as skillfully as she did her hands . <P> Those who knew anything of the career of Soprano Hallie Stiles were astonished when it was announced that her first formal U.

Even the day after her great success , Singer Stiles had to ask the cook for an additional two francs to buy her morning coffee . <P> Nearly four years have passed since then . Hallie Stiles ' performances of Manon , Marguerite , Melisande , Butterfly , Louise , have been fads at the Opera Comique . The French like her because she has made their graces her own . Many a U. S. visitor has proudly claimed her to be the most satisfying artist on the French opera stage . Proudest of all , according to friends , has been her husband , Dickson Greene , son of Grant Dickson Greene , Syracuse foundryman . While she sang in Paris , he worked there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stiles he was present in Chicago last week to applaud .
