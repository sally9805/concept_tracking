Last week Common Pleas Judge Frederick P. Walther of Cleveland answered " No " to the question : Can a newspaper editorial criticize a court-order ? ( TIME , July 22 ) . For criticism of a Walther court-order he fined Editor Louis B. Seltzer of the Cleveland Press and Chief Editorial Writer Carlton Kingsbury Matson , $500 each , ordered them to spend 30 days in jail . <P> Attorney for Defendants Seltzer and Matson was Wilsonian Secretary of War Newton Diehl Baker , able orator . His pleas : 1 ) That freedom of the press was in danger . 2 ) That the criticized Walther injunction , which restrained Sheriff Hanratty from closing down Thistledown Race Track " if same be not in violation of the law , " * was no injunction at all . 3 ) That the editorial was not contempt , because it did not interfere with justice in view of the fact that the case was not still pending . Furthermore , said Lawyer Baker : <P> " When these editorials ! were read , Your Honor made the observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , then Your Honor , as I quote your own phrase , ' was not fit to sit upon that bench ' . . . As a matter of fact , the question of a judge 's fitness to sit on a bench can not be decided by him . ... If a man be a judge , and if some other man thinks he is an improper person to be a judge , the judge does not become proper by restraining the person . " <P> Deaf to polite , subtle Baker arguments was Judge Walther . After sentencing the Pressmen , he refused stay of execution , ordered his critics to start serving their prison terms at once . Defendants Seltzer and Matson issued a statement . In closing , it said : <P> " Thirty days in jail and a $500 fine are a small price to pay , if such a price must be paid , in the contest revolving around such a principle . " <P> But not for six or seven months , at least , will they have to start their 30 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawyer Baker went before Appellate Judge Willis Vickery , who released the Pressmen on $1,000 each to await an autumn court with many a case preceding theirs on the busy Vickery calender . It will be the second time a Walther contempt sentence has come before Judge Vickery . The first time Judge Walther was reversed . <P> Other newspapers , interested in a question so close to them , gave the case top-page headlines , columns of space . Many published the Baker plea in full . Some editorialized . Said the New York Herald Tribune . " It is difficult to see how it the editorial can have interfered with the administration of the law . . . . " Most friendly was the Cleveland Plain Dealer toward its rival and neighbor . In part it said : " The Plain Dealer congratulates the editors ... for bringing a vital public issue before the people . It congratulates Newton D. Baker for his masterly presentation of the question . . . . Walther 's so-called injunction . . . was an inexcusable act . . . . He indulged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be permitted to point out such facts as these-to tell a judge he blunders when reason shows he blunders-newspapers will lose one of their most important functions . . . . " <P>
