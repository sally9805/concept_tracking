Criminal action against those involved in the naval reserve oil scandals has long been in prospect . Some time ago the Government secured indictments for bribery and conspiracy against Albert B. Fall and the Edward L. Dohenys , Sr. and Jr . These indictments had been quashed by Chief Justice McCoy of the District of Columbia Supreme Court , on the grounds that an officer of the Department of Justice had been improperly present in the Grand Jury room . Last week the District of Columbia Court of Appeals overruled Chief Justice McCoy . The indictments stand . The Government can go on with its case against Fall and Doheny concerning the little black bag containing $100,000.
