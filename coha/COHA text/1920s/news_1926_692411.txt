txt The sun set this evening on a happy people in the anthracite valleys , which teemed with activity for the first time since the strike of 158,000 mine workers that began nearly aix months ago and ended last midnight . Although only between 60 and 75 per cent . of the miners responded to the shrill colliery whistles this morning , those who descended into the pits plied their tasks with a will . The first fresh mined coal was dumped into the breakers at 7:15 this morning . At 11 o'clock the first car of prepared coal was ready for the market , and this evening puffing engines were hauling the coal to tidewater . The first labor trouble to develop after the return to work on a five-year Contract occurred at No. 4 shaft of the Ewen Colliery of the Pennsylvania Coal Company at Pittston in District No. 1 . A wage dispilte resulted in an unauthorized strike of 350 men . Colliery officials will meet union representatives tomorrow to straighten out the tangle . One Fatal Accident in Day . A strike is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibility of keeping the m ' -s in normal repair during a long suspension . Although many cave-ins were discovered in various parts of the coal fields , only one fatal accident was reported . John Luzambak , aged 30 , of Scranton , was caught in a pocket of black damp in the Glen Alden Company 's Sloan colliery . He died in a hospital an hour after being taken from the pit . Failure of many thousands to r2-spond to the orders to return to worlc did not surprise operating officials . Many men have not yet returned to the region , which they deserted when the strike began . Others fear to return on the first day because of a superstitious dread of accidents . Many dropped in on superintendents and made sure of their old " working places " and then returned to smoke at their firesides with the promise to appear with carbide lamp and gum boots tomorrow morning . Trolley service for the miners was resumed early this morning . The men and boys who jammed the cars and dropped off near the mine shafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Sept . I when they quit the pits for what they felt was to be the usual three weeks ' holiday strike before the writing of a new agreement . The three weeks lengthened into months until want and stiff &ring; stalked through the anthracite patches . Business virtually halted , stores laid off clerks , railroads dismissed employes and traveling salesmen gave the region a wide berth . Today the hotels were filled . Clerks greeted salesmen warmly . Stores ordered their full forces to duty . Money , hoarded for thrifty expenditures , again tinkled in the cash registers . Back to the Old Diggings . " Have n't seen this place in six months , " remarked a weather-beaten miner beside THE NEW Your THIES correspondent In a mines car which carried a group of coal diggers to the underground working in a mine five miles from this city today . His companions grinned in reply and clutched their dinner pails . The car descended rapidly In the gloomy hole and came to a sudden stop at the bottom . The miners climbed , out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flickering flames of the carbide lamps threw grotesque shadows down the main gangway , braced at the sides and across the roof with stout wooden supports . After " checking in , " the miners walked to their old chambers , some a mile or more from the foot of the shaft . There were no preliminaries . If the chamber was intact and a couple of thwacks with a crowbar showed the roof was solid and there was no danger of a fall of rock , the coal cutting began . Soon the chambers re-echoed the muffled reports of exploding dynamite . Shot after shot was fired and many tons of coal brought down . Coal Begins Pouring Into Cars . Laborers loaded the coal , some pieces as large as a barrel head , into mine cars . In some mines donkeys dragged the cars to the foot of the shaft . whence they were hoisted to the top of the breakers , where grinding crushers , ten stories above the ground , fractured the larger lumps . Thence the coal started down through series of jigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing at the bottom in neat piles of freshly washed coal , graded and sized from rice and buckweat to nut , stove and egg . Railroad cars placed under each pile yawned a welcome as the chutes opened and the freshly mined coal poured into the receptacles . Electric cars with live trolley wires a few inches above the driver 's head are used in some mines instead of the mules to haul the small mine cars . Some miners who reported for work today , were disappointed on learninsg fleet the paths to their old working places were clogged by falls of rock . Several days will have to be spent in clearing up the tons of rock and debris before access may be had to the chambers . All Agree on Being Clad to Get Back . Between 3 and 4 o'clock this afternoon the miners , who ended their first day in the pits since Sept. 1 , were hoisted out of the workings and trudged the snow-filled roads to their homes , tired , but happy to know that a fortnight hence a pay check would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was the general response . It was the same way in the breakers and the other sections of the collieries . Some of the gaunt breakers which reared their giant eyes toward the sky were quiet today except for repair men and carpenters busily engaged in testing out the machinery , renewing parts and in attending to the many details ' necessary before one of the basic in dostries of the United States may again run normally . 61,000 Tons Now on the Way . It was estimated that 65,000 tons of Coal were mined today . This is 20 per cent . of the normal daily tonnage . A considerable part of this tonnage was put through the breakers and It was reported that some freshly mined coall for New York reached tidewater tonight . Shipments are being hurried over the Brie , the Pennsylvania , the Delaware &; Hudson , the Philadelphia &; Read-1 Ing , the Lehigh Valley and the Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western Railroads . Nearly all of the 125 producing companies were busy today . An attempt will be made to distribute the coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where it Is needed . Normal production is not expected before the first week of March . In a few days the operators will check up on their forces in an endeavor to ascertain how many men they may be expected to replace . Under the terms of the agreement the strikers return to their old Jobs . Vacancies will not be filled until it is certain that the old men will not return . Most of those who failed to appear at the pits today were company miners . Their absence made idle many laborers who had no coal to load . 10,000 Railroad Men Back on Job . The end of the strike was beiled as welcome boon by railroad workers , ' of whom about 10,000 were laid off when the suspension began . When the miners receive their first pay two weeks hence they will find themselves richer by approximately 110,000,000 . Their daily earnings average $1,250,000 every business day .

In the Shamokin region , where coal is mined by the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company and the Susquehanna Coal Company , it was reported that more than 75 per cent . of the men returned to work . The number varied with different mines and localities . The largest number of defections was given as 40 per cent . FREES SMOKE VIOLATORS . Magistrate Glad That Use of Soft Coal Is About Over . Expressing thankfulness that the period of soft coal using was about over , Chief Magistrate in the Municipal Term Court , 300 Mulberry Street , suspended sentence yesterday on forty-eight violators of the smoke ordinance .

Companies Here Say Quotations on Anthracite Are Normal . The Delaware , Lackawanna . &; Western Coal Company , 120 Broadway , and the Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company , 143 Liberty Street , two of the largest producers of anthracite , announced yesterday their prices for fresh-mined hard coal at the mines . Both companies quoted $8.75 a ton for egg coal , $9.25 for stove , $8.75 for chestnut and $8 for pea . These prices , it was announced , were on the same basis as those which would normally have gone into effect on Sept. 1 had there been no strike . It is expected that most of the other hard coal producers will announce their new prices today . These in all probability will be from 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. , L. &; W. and the Lehigh &; WilkesBarre . The increase will represent the normal differential prevailing in different parts of the anthracite region due to the varying cost of production . In announcing the new prices , Eliot Farley , President of the Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western Coal Company , said : " We understand from such information as we have been able to gather that the standard company produceis , of anthracite will follow the general policy represented by this announce ment of normal Winter prices . This early announcement should reassure consumers . " Shipments of anthracite from the mining region will start tomorrow and hard coal should begin to arrive here next week . The quantities , of course . will be limited in relation to the demand and , naturally , all orders can not be filled at once . It must be borne in mind that , owing to the prolonged strikes the market is short about 35e 000,000 tons of anthracite and this can not be made up immediately . " Advices received here from the hard coal region yesterday were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a labor shortage of about 25 per cent , of the normal working force . This , it was said , was due to the fact that many mine workers had left the region for employment elsewhere and had not yet returned . Retail coal dealers here were unable to say what prices would be quoted to consumers for the freshmined anthracite . Olin J. Stephens , President of the Stephens Fuel Company , Inc. , one of the largest retailers , said the early retail prices would depend on how much coal the producers were able to ship . ? Naturally the local prices for anthracite will have to be averaged on the quantity of independent coal the dealers here are compelled to take to supply their demand , " said Mr. Stephens . " When hard coal is scarce the independent producers are always able to command prices considerably in excess of those charged by the larger producing companies and the dealer , who has to take both high and low cost coal in order to obtain an adequate supply for his trade , must base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephens added that he was certain the larger dealers here would make their prices as reasonable as possible .
