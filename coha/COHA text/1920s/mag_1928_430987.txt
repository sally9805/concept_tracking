 | THE most Spanish of Spain " is the way Seville is described by the majority of visitors who ravel down from Madrid and up from Cadiz and come to a brief halt in this famed town of southern Spain , capital of ancient Andalusia , - sun-swathed city of splotched shadows , where encroaching modernity seems ever to struggle futilely against the strongly entrenched , if slightly crumbling , glory of long ago . And perhaps those folk who are wont thus to describe Seville are right . Probably nowhere else in all the Iberian Peninsula does one come upon more definite traces of that luxuriant flower that was Old Spain than in this city of a quarter of a million souls , which straggles along the banks of the slow-moving Guadalquivir River . In Madrid , in Barcelona , in other thriving cities of the north and east , one is in Spain , to be sure ; but a Spain revivified , cosmopolitan , commercialized . In the high interior , from Caceres to Castellon , one likewise knows Spain ; but it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple beauties of blue skies and verdant hillsides are somehow transmitted to one 's daily life ( see map , page 314 ) . And in the mountain-top towns of the south , crumbled outposts of Moslem might , one finds the Spanish influence still strangely subdued by moldering remnants of the once far-flung Moorish empire . But in Seville , now scintillating , now sleepy , is discovered a Spain not of the drowsing past , nor yet of the bustling present ; it is an indiscriminate mingling of both . Abiding through the centuries here on sun-swept slopes , the city has built for itself a dwelling place of traditions ; but they are not a high wall hedging it about . Seville takes pride in her glorious past , treasures it , becomes frankly arrogant about it at times ; but her chief love is life and the living of it . Her lichen-covered churches she holds inviolate . Not one cobweb may be removed , nor a single crumbling block of hand-hewed stone be remortared ; but , across a well-paved avenue , a steel-fabricated office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . SEVILLE ; ' S HISTORY IS AS COLOREUL AS HER SHAWLS Laden donkeys may , and do , wander willy-nilly through every downtown thoroughfare , but the driver of a limousine must keep his eyes open for " one-way street " signs and his ears alert for the traffic officer 's whistle .  | Seville 's history is as colorful as one of the silken shawls that drape the shoulders of her dark-eyed senoritas , as varied as the moods of her people , as interesting as any story may well be that depicts the romance of a town which has lived through the rise , glory , and decay of half a dozen nations . And because that thirty-century record has direct bearing upon the predilections and characteristics of the Seville of to-day , a brief mention is here made of it . The city 's actual genesis is lost , hidden by the obscuring veil which shrouds much of the remote past of the Mediterranean , and which was only slightly torn aside by the adventuring Phoenicians , and later by the warrior-merchants of Carthage . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite traces remain . The crumbling wall which still stalks through the thickly peopled Macarena and Capuchinos districts of the city was built under the direction of the Cwsars . A few miles from Seville the buried Roman city of Italica , of which thus far only the arena has been fully excavated , gives mute , if muddy , evidence of that classic civilization which was in full flower at the birth of the Christian Era ( see page 278 ) . Many of the carved treasures of Italica and of the other Roman ruins in Carmona , near by , have been collected and may be seen to-day in the Provincial Museum of Seville and in several private homes of the city . The great majority , however , are believed still to lie buried beneath clay coverlets wherein generations of gnarled olive trees have embedded their roots . The Visigoths , following the fall of Rome 's western empire , lingered for a brief three centuries in Seville . However , scant fragments proving their residence are found to-day , because the Goths , being a destructive rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstood the wear of time . The Jews , too , from behind Byzantium came here to have their home , rose to positions of power , endured grievous persecution , passed , but left carved memories of their stay . Their stiffly formal architecture , with its clearcut , shadowless figures , blends well with sun-laden Seville .  | Likewise the gypsies came here , and here they yet remain , crowded together in noisy little and big families in Triana , the ragged suburb of Seville , across the Guadelquivir . By day the passer-by must verily join the donkeys in Triana 's streets if he would avoid the cluttered vegetable markets encumbering the sidewalks , and by night he may pause a brief moment in the stillness and hear , above the cry of babies and bark of dogs , that soft sound that speaks of rustling sands ' neath Saharan skies at midnight . THE MOORS PLACED A PERMANENT STAMP ON THE CITY Finally , the Moors possessed Seville . One must say finally because the city remains to-day something of a Moorish town . Saint Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold some seven centuries ago ; but all his might could not wipe out the Orient . The picturesque Santa Cruz district of Seville , with its narrow , crooked streets and flat-roofed , companionable houses , has changed very little in the last thousand years . The city 's famous and equally beloved Giralda is to-day much the same as when a Moorish architect completed it , in 1196 , and the white-robed followers of Mohammed used it as a minaret from which to call the Faithful to prayer . And the Tower of Gold , while slightly grimy from steamboats ' funnels in the Guadalquivir River , is not greatly changed from that day in I220 when the Moorish Governor of Seville conspired with the western sun 's reflection to give it a name . But it was the virility of western Christendom , building on the Orient 's lavish splendor , that made the Seville of to-day . Not until mosques were transformed into churches did this city , nestling at the threshold of European civilization , attain its rightful place in the sun . Phoenician , Carthaginian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? all collaborated in the making of Seville ; but the greatest of these carried a cross . It is with this epoch of the city 's eventful history that the Sevillano of to-day  | likes best to be associated : the days of the militant Saint Ferdinand and his conquering followers ; the days of a courageous Spanish queen who readily offered to pawn her jewels that a foolhardy Genoese mariner might sail away into the unknown ; the days of Magellan and of the conquistadores ; the days when Spanish galleons , gold laden , anchored at the foot of the Tower of Gold and made of Seville one of the mightiest , wealthiest ports in Christendom ? these are the halcyon days that share most in the memories of the Seville of now and become a colorful cloak for her modernity . That long-ago blossoming , when every etal , unfurling , revealed an epic of adventure and conquest and accomplishment , is the proud , albeit somewhat jaunty , flower that adorns the sun-flecked hair of this daughter of southern Spain . WORSHIPS HER PAST WHILE BROADENING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She reveres her heroes of olden time , but it is the heroes of to-day that occupy her thoughts and newspapers . Annually she devotes many holidays in obeisance before ancient glories , but the days before and after are spent in widening her narrow streets to accommodate a rapidly increasing motor traffic and in building steel and concrete office buildings wherein to house her ever-expanding commercial enterprises . She points with pride to where the caravels of the New World 's conquerors anchored in the Guadalquivir River , but barely a stone 's throw away electric cranes strive the day long with vast cargoes to and from the earth 's four corners . Alcazar , the old Moorish palace rebuilt to house the splendor of the courts of Andalusian kings , remains much the same as it was seven centuries ago ; but immediately across the street the new Alfonso XIII Hotel transplants one straightway to the luxury of up-to-date Paris , or London , or New York . It is in the nature of things that the people of Seville should blend in their present lives a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each race , in  | lingering and passing , has left something to the Sevillano , whether it be in language , customs , architecture , or in mere physical characteristics . Few of these gifts appear uppermost today , however . Many racial threads twine through the tapestry that depicts the life in Seville as it is lived at present ; but all of these strands have been happily woven into a fabric wherein is portrayed the glory of the past , the awakened strivings of the present , and a future that is at once promising and undetermined . FEW VISITORS SEE THE TRUE HOME LIFE OF THE CITY Much has been written , but little is actually known of the home life of Seville . Those fortunate individuals who come to southern Spain armed with letters of introduction to high officials and wealthy families go away with glowing accounts of the sumptuousness of life , of the lavish hospitality accorded visitors , and of the very modern manner of living in this only superficially modernized city . Other earnest seekers after local color who visit Seville and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Sevillanos , endure the inconveniences of modest Spanish homes , spend long hours in crowded cafes to engage in endless discussions with the ever-talkative habitues , attend frequent festivals and bullfights , where they wear the native costume and drink much manzanilla , and exert themselves to enter into the spirit of all things Sevillano ? these folk carry away a vivid , glowing picture of a Seville en fiesta ? colorful , rather noisy , highly picturesque . Some visitors , more studiously inclined , come to Seville solely that they may delve into the dusty depths of the city 's richly endowed Archives of the Indies . Staid commercial travelers know only the quiet serenity of darkened offices , where much real business is transacted , but where the many languid clerks still have time for a brief chat and a contemplative cigarette in the flower-choked patio . But only in rare instances does the foreigner come to know the true home life of the Sevillano , and perhaps never does he come wholly to appreciate it . For the home hereabout is a thing apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very simple , fulsomely satisfying to its several members , and complete unto itself . It is a takenfor-granted part of existence and seldom enters into the discussions and activities of everyday life . Foreign admittance thereto not desired ? indeed , is not comprehended ? and in fact there is little social intercourse among the families themselves . Of course , there are exceptions , particularly among those folk financially in a position to travel extensively in foreign lands , where they adopt foreign customs ; but the average home circle of Seville is a closed circle , to which there is little , if any , ingress . Inquisitive minds wonder at such a bound-round existence ; wonder how the members of Seville 's old families , and especially the secluded women members , pass their time in the inner circle ; wonder what , in the absence of house parties , interfamily meetings , and social gatherings , the folk of Seville do to exchange ideas and round out their knowledge of life in general . But that wonder invariably comes to naught when it encounters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suavity from the frank simplicity of his home life . And so he who would the most sympathetically know Seville will not be overcurious regarding her carefully guarded secret , will not be offended when he is not admitted to the inner circle of family life , and , when he goes away , he will carry with him the knowledge that , while he has indeed failed to penetrate to the heart of the home , it is merely because he has been seeking after a sacred , inviolable part of the life of the people , has been desiring to tread on holy ground , has been asking for a glimpse of a treasure pedestaled in an enshrined part of that picture gallery called the human heart . A MEAGER INCOME BUYS MUCH HAPPINESS There is not much money per capita in Seville these days . To be sure , certain of the city 's families are immensely wealthy and live in the style of oriental potentates and occidental plutocrats , while foreign residents are forced , for appearances ' sake ,  | to struggle along at a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From that comparatively low social being , the singsong street salesman , whose finances are calculated in terms of the perra gorda and chic-a , on through the market-place or " so-many reales " class to the relatively wealthy persons , who speak nonchalantly of pesetas and duros , fully threefourths of the town 's population lives and has its being and is wholly happy on an income of around a dollar a day per person . In many cases this income must cover the needs of an entire family , and some of Seville 's families need much . But somehow there is always enough left over for the menfolk to afford a few hours each evening with convivial friends in a favorite coffee shop , and to secure a seat " in the sun " at the Sunday bullfight ; and for the numerous children to purchase penny sweets . as occasion demands . f r o m the howling huckster who passes the door each morning . accompanied by a congenial donkey laden with sticky lusciousness ; and for the women of the family to have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m b , a cobwebby lace mantilla , and a holeless pair of silk stockings ? this last because the weaving of silk hosiery has in recent years become one of Spain 's leading manufacturing industries . Not much money . but it goes a long way and buys lots of happiness when one knows how and where to buy and appreciates what one gets . And , besides , there is always the bare possibility that one might win the lottery some day ! The people of Seville blend past and present in their dress and in many of theie customs . The high Spanish comb and lace mantilla of olden times are still worn here , perhaps more generally than in any other city of Spain . But the comb is more often than not perched precariously in modernly bobbed hair , while the mantilla covers a beautiful head filled with decidedly up-to-date feminine thoughts and ideas ( see pages 280 and 283 ) . The women have long since discarded the silk shawls and flounced dresses of the past in favor of short skirts and simple  | frocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and special occasions that one comes forth in the picturesque but cumbersome costume of her forbears see Color Plates VI and VIII ) . And the men 's traditional dress ? t h e rakish flat sombrero , short jacket , and closefitting trousers that one frequently associates with the dashing masculinity of Spain has long since been lost in the influx of European and American styles , although here again a holiday or bullfight will serve to resurrect an infrequent relic of yesteryear . CREAMY COMPLEXIONS ARE A HERITAGE FROM MOORISH DAYS Racially , the people owe much to the Moorish residence in sotfthern Spain . Brilliant black and brown eyes and complexions ranging from darkest sepia to the most delicate of creamy textures are strangely reminiscent of long generations of ancestors who dwelt beneath the Sahara sun . Intermingled with this great majority , however , one finds an increasingly large percentage of the blue eyes and light hair of more Anglo-Saxon communities . The language hereabout is fundamentally Spanish , but on the street it amounts to an Andalusian patois which those deeply versed in pure Castilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is an aggravating superfluity with the average Sevillano , and he insists further upon not taking too seriously many of the more involved letters and syllables of the purer tongue . It is , in fact , a situation closely paralleled in the United States , where the northerner endures with arched eyebrows the unusually broad accents from below the Mason-Dixon line . THE OLIVE CENTER OF THE WORLD Seville is an industrious city and particularly so just now , with final preparations being made for the opening of the first international exposition in its present-day history ( see text , page 300 ) . Many of the city 's activities revolve about the production and shipment of pickled olives and various grades of olive oil , for it is the central point of distribution for the richest olive-producing area in the world . @# @#  | There is an ancient local saying that the only genuine Queen olives produced on earth are grown within seeing distance of the Giralda Tower , the soil and climate of this region being particularly well suited to the full maturing of this class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is not wholly agricultural . Much of the cork insulation found in our modern electrical refrigerators and many of the cork disks in the metal caps of ginger ale ? and other ? bottles were shipped from the port of Seville ; and the Sevillano tile and pottery industry is known wherever ceramic beauty is appreciated . The world also acknowledges no wrought iron more artistic than that fashioned by the gypsy families of Triana ( see text , page 279 ) . It is interesting to know that these latter industries frequently represent the accumulated knowledge of several generations of potters or iron workers , the manufacturing processes and trade secrets Photograph from Richard For , : being handed down from father to son , with the result that when the family line runs out , as it sometimes does , that particular make of tile , pottery , or artistic iron ceases to be manufactured , and thus becomes the legitimate prey of the antique dealers . MANUFACTURE OF " ANTIQUES " IS A MAJOR INDUSTRY And these Seville antique dealers ! The resurrection and , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " antiques " constitute one of the city 's leading industries . The score and more of antique shops in Seville have long been the mecca of collectors from all parts of the world , with the result that many tons of old Spanish furniture , iron grilles , paintings by old masters , moth-eaten hangings and draperies , ancestral silk shawls , ceramic tile the secret of whose soft glaze has long since been lost , anciently wrought pottery , and many other highly prized objects are  | shipped each year from Seville . And no doubt many more tons remain to be found , bargained over , and eventually purchased , although it is well for the prospective buyer to remember that clever wormholes do not for antiquity make , nor rust-crusted iron bars for age . This reflection brings to mind the old story ( itself an antique ! ) , heard wherever t h e sale of antiquities has been developed into a fine art . The local version has to do with a young foreign student temporarily sojourning in Seville , who considers himself something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day he happens to pass the cluttered window of an antique shop and notices there , all but hidden by the bric-a-brac bestrewing the showcase , a certain blue bowl , fascinating despite a thick layer of dust . A moment he studies it , and then , feeling that here indeed is a " find , " he straightway goes inside . But the grizzled old shopkeeper , while gently courteous , is firm withal and refuses to he tempted by an offer of 5o pesetas , declaring with many gesticulations that the price can not possibly he a centimo below a hundred . Then weeks of haggling follow , during which time the pride of possession enters deep into the soul of the student , while incidentally the shopkeeper comes down to 75 pesetas . And then , just as the youth is on the point of leaving Seville and while he is still debating that extra 25 pesetas , black disaster falls : Two wealthy tourists enter the shop and from beneath the very nose of the covetous collector carry the blue bowl away in triumph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice trembling with disappointment , the student turns wrathfully on the old shopkeeper . " You sold it for too , and vet you offered it to me for 75 ! And just as I am leaving , too ! " " You are leaving Seville , senor ? " Twinkling old eyes regard blazing young ones . " Then , amigo , come with me . You have been a good boy and . . . Through a mysterious door at the back of the shop and into an unexpectedly large ,  | well-lighted room the student is conducted . There , after the old man has carefully tinlocked a mammoth cabinet of carved wood and thrown back the doors , are discovered dozens of blue bowls standing in neat and silent companionship , each an exact replica of the " find " in the window . " Because you have been a good boy and did not tell the people of my lower offer to you , I have the great honor of presenting you with one of these . No , amigo , you shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , no ? You say you are leaving Seville to-morrow ? Then I shall show you my greatest treasure . " A very small cabinet is thereupon reverently approached , gingerly opened , and nestling on a velvet cushion is an exquisite blue pitcher . " Quite perfect , is it not , senor , save for that infinitesimal chip out of the lip ? But it is old , my friend , centuries old . And I must tell you a very pretty romance about how it received that tiny blemish . " After hearing the story and with difficulty overcoming the old man 's dogged resistance , the youth is finally permitted to purchase the pitcher for 75 pesetas , but only because " he has been a good boy . " There is a sequel to the story . The student , returning unexpectedly to Seville some days later and chancing once again to pass the antique shop , beholds there , all but hidden by the jumbled odds and ends of antiquity , sadly forlorn , a little blue pitcher , quite perfect save for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTERFERES WITH TIMES OE RELAXATION Seville 's industries , however , are not permitted to interfere too radically with her moments of rest and relaxation . Long hours of labor do not lap over into longer  | hours of conviviality . Every coffee shop Land there are scores of them in Seville ) is a noisy stamping ground , humanitychoked , from early in the afternoon until long after midnight . Indeed , one may pass at any time during the day or night and see gesticulating knots of men crowded about cup-cluttered tables , talking , talking . Always the folk of Seville talk ? rapidly , energetically , ceaselessly . Much real business of a local nature is transacted in the course of the endless conversations . Country people arrange the sale of their farm produce and cattle ; many small trades are made in which , after some hours of conversational elaboration , the honors are about even between the smoothtongued townsman and the more credulous but equally artful man from the hills ; parcels of grapes and olives and oranges and figs orally change hands . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk cafes and club lounges give themselves over to current items of general interest . Just now the approaching Exposition is food for much talk ; or perhaps the discussions revolve momentarily about a new dancer at the Variedades , or the Kursaal , or another of the town 's several variety theaters ; or the talk is of a forthcoming fiesta , or of this week 's fiesta , or of last week 's fiesta . If a bullfight is near at hand , the respective merits of the several fighters on the program are carefully dissected and reassembled , always with the tacit understanding that , no matter how good he may be , no fighter can approach in perfection one Joselito , killed in the bull ring several years ago , but still regarded by the present generation of bullfight enthusiasts as the greatest matador of all time . Always they talk , the Sevillanos , the while they nibble bits of dried ham , or spiced olives , or potato chips and sip their steaming coffee . They are abstemious otherwise . Perhaps one may occasionally ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with charged water from the ubiquitous siphon ; and on hot clays  | tall beers are sometimes in evidence ; but anything approaching intoxication is so rare in Seville as to be an oddity for small boys to jeer at , men to look strangely selfconscious about , and women to avoid by stepping carefully to the opposite side of the street . These talkative gatherings are wholly a man 's world . The feminine portion of Seville remains at home . Sometimes , in the hot summer months , the ladies may accompany husbands and brothers to one of the many open-air motion-picture shows located throughout the city , and in the spring and autumn the afternoon " paseo , " with perhaps a dish of ice cream and a little round mound of sweet cakes , and even a theater party afterward , is a daily custom in which the womenfolk participate . But , as a general rule , one rarely sees unaccompanied women on the streets of Seville , unless they be servant girls hurrying to and from market , or persuasive old women with lottery tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular ticket is verily the gordo , which means the big prize ( see page 287 ) . THE BULLFIGHT STILL REIGNS SUPREME On Sundays there is the bullfight , still the national pastime of Spain . Reports have recently gone forth that the popularity of bullfighting is on the wane , and indeed much interest is being displayed in the game of association football , introduced into this particular part of the kingdom nearly 40 years ago by an English mining company , in the Province of Huelva . But , all reports to the contrary notwithstanding , bullfights still reign supreme . From the first fight of the season , on Easter Sunday afternoon , on through the summer , until the cold , wet  | days of early October , the bull ring in Seville is assured of a capacity attendance for every Sunday and holiday event . It is an audience composed of 14,000 umpires , and the toreador who would please so much discrimination , particularly in Seville , must be clever indeed . Each critic is convinced that he is a past master in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever ready to shout and whistle and even to enact his displeasure if the man in the ring does not give of his best . On the other hand , courage is instantly applauded , and if courage go hand in hand with cleverness , then indeed is there pandemonium . The bull likewise comes in for his share of applause or condemnation , depending upon his reaction to the toreador 's incitements . In fact , one has the feeling that the audience is there in the ring with the fighter . The hull is the enemy . but a highly respected one , who , if he be brave , is secretly admired , but none the 1 e s s relentlessly resisted . A poor display of skill on the part of the fighter seems to be a reflection on the spectators themselves , and the resultant outpouring of displeasure is but the crowd seeking to cover its own embarrassment and chagrin . Success is the spectators ' success , and the uproarious applause is but a cloak for selfcongratulation and incidentally , relief that the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight is a kind of safety valve for inhibitions that a half dozen questing , restless , racial life-streams have contributed ( luring the past centuries ( see , also , text , page 277 ) . THE VISITOR WANDERS THROUGH CENTURIES But , while the bullfight is a very vivid and colorful part of the life of the Spanish people , Seville is most beloved of the tourist for its many historical buildings and timeworn traditions . The majority of itineraries unfortunately call for only a few hours in Seville , or at best for a day or two ; and thus the visitor engages in a hectic rushing from one place of interest to another , an ever-read ) red Baedeker  | clutched in one hand and a shabby camera in the other , with a consequent sadly jumbled notion of the city 's treasures crammed into his head . But those who are favored with more leisure may spend an entire day in Alcazar and its gardens , wandering from one century to another , from one race 's remnants to another 's present keepsakes , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 298 ) , there the jealously guarded suite of Peter the Cruel , and beyond these the richly embellished Hall of the Ambassadors , and yonder the towers of the Gate of the Lion , where shadows become softening searchlights revealing the beauty that crumbling masonry creates . Or they may climb the winding ramp of the Giralda , that geometrical masterpiece of the Moors . In the tower they may commune with a veritable family of great and little bells , see all of Seville at their feet , and discover that much of the city 's life is lived on its beflowered housetops . Thereafter they may spend long minutes in the vast Gothic Cathedral , and find there untold riches in jewels accumulated by devotees . They muse before the tomb of Columbus ( knowing , too , that Santo Domingo p 300 disputes with Seville the honor of possessing the remains of the Admiral ) ; worship the beauty that has been built into the many imposing altars , and experience the feeling of smallness that comes to human thought when compassed about by heights so deeply arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the Provincial Museum and exclaim in rapture over the master 's glow that has been woven into the paintings of Murillo , and El Greco , and Roelas , and Valdes Leal , and others . PRICELESS MANUSCRIPTS IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE INDIES In the Archives of the Indies they may inspect a few of the , literally , thousands of volumes and bundles of manuscripts treasured there , some of which are said to have belonged originally to Christopher Columbus , and each of which tells a little of that fascinating story of romance and adventure which clothes Spain 's former colonial empire . Or they may motor to the ruins of Italica and dwell for a brief moment on the scenes that once were enacted there in the old Roman amphitheater , where will be pointed out the prison room of early Christian martyrs , and but a step away the stillsinister dungeon wherein were housed certain lions , prelibatively drooling . And again in Seville , if they be not in a hurry , there is the Tower of Gold , which , despite its being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bank of the Guadalquivir as it did in the days when there passed through it fabulous quantities of gold won in the New World by the conquistadores ( see pages 284 and 292 ) . The House of Pilate , popularly , but erroneously , believed to be copied from the Jerusalem original , and one of the finest specimens of the decorative value of Seville 's ceramic tile ; the Palace of San Telmo , now a seminary for priests , hu , still with its unsurpassed carved stone doorway ; the American House , dedicated by a Spanish nobleman to the memory of Washington Irving as a tribute to that great writer 's love for Spain ; the tobacco factory , fit to be the palace of a queen , since it was the place where " Carmen " first sang and incidentally ( according to a much-to-be-doubted story ) where she still works as one of the 3,000 or more quite elderly ladies employed there in making cigars and cigarettes ? all of these and many more may be visited by those who do not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or motor bus for Cordova , or Granada , or Cadiz . And as the traveler wanders , wondering , he will pass through some of the most quaintly named streets on earth . Through the Street of the Love of God , or Serpents Street , or Pepper , where the houses grow so near one another that the dweller 's life is his neighbor 's , and family skeletons must perforce move out from very embarrassment ; and old Coffin Street , and near-by Life Street , and the Street of Jesus of the Great Power , and that of the Sweetheart of the River , and ? alas ! a book might be written about Seville 's streets , some so wide as to be reminiscent of the Champs Iaysees , and others so narrow as seriously to disconcert the smallest of inquiring-eyed donkeys , be he too voluminously loaded with bread baskets , or milk cans , or vegetable and fruit hampers . While walking , he will likewise encounter a native curiosity the like of which is believed to exist nowhere else on earth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cynosure of every black or brown or blue eye . They stare from grilled windows , from high balconies , from doorways , from the backs of donkeys , from coffee shops , from passers-by . Quietly they stare , unless the object of their gaze be that fair sex which carries beauty so lightly , in which case wondering lips will sometimes utter softly what eloquent eyes shout aloud . They seem always curious , the Sevillanos , their eyes devouring one hungrily with a naive fixity , and continuing so to devour even after one has turned the next corner . SEVILLE 'S GREAT EXPOSITION OPENS THIS MONTH This year the tourist to Seville will have the added interest of the Ibero-American Exposition , scheduled to open on March 15 , and to continue thereafter for nine months . While it is primarily a SpanishAmerican reunion of the mother country and her former American colonies , the United States has been asked to participate by reason of the fact that the Rio Grande was no deterrent to the early Spanish discoverers . We are building three handsome  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds . The Exposition , which is to stress particularly exhibits of fine arts , literature , and history , is serving to add a great wealth of new and immensely virile architure to Seville 's already rich store . One of the United States pavilions , a permanent structure , is fashioned after the Spanish colonial style as found in southern California . The Argentine building is reminiscent of the prodigal freedom of widespread pampas , albeit with a certain Spanish restraint ever pervading . Mexico has constructed a pavilion that rushes one back to the civilized Mayan mysteries of long ago bizarre , almost fantastic , ever beautiful . Colombia 's building is a pleasant blend of Spanish mission and colonial massiveness . Chile is building a picturesque pile which recalls Spain 's colonial glory as adapted to the ruggedness of the wind-torn Andes . And so on through the list of a dozen or more American republics that are constructing permanent buildings which , after the Exposition , will be used as the consular offices and homes of the respective nations . A GREAT SPANISH-AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likewise a splendid addition to Seville 's architectural beauty . The vast semicircular Building of Spain , laden with the light that shines from ceramic tile and divided into 49 segments , each one of which is devoted to one of the 49 provinces of Spain ; the Fine Arts Building , the Ancient Arts Building , the deeply domed Building of Seville , the Royal Pavilion , and various others , built to house exhibits of the beauty which man has fashioned with his hands . are all here waiting to be seen , and afterward to form the nucleus of a great Spanish-American University . And all are in a setting so rich in natural beauty as to be a constant ' challenge to other parks of the world ? the Maria Luisa Park ( page 310 ) . Seville may indeed he called " the most Spanish of Spain . " He who comes in the early spring will find it at its best ; will know the solemnity of Holy Week and the vivid , pulsing life of the spring festivals immediately following . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 religious brotherhoods of Seville , as they pass slowly in procession through the streets , a sparkling panoply ? pass and leave behind a tattered beggar asking alms . He will hear the spontaneous outburst of devotional song that sometimes accompanies the processions and catch the reverberating echoes of the deep-toned organ in the Cathedral , crashing forth in rejoicing on Easter Sunday morning . He will hear the strummed tunes of a flamenco ( lanced beneath blazing lights in a flower-bedecked caseta , and the unrestrained laughter of day-long happiness . He may hear , indeed , a Spanish guitar if he supplies the necessary wherewithal and makes careful advance arrangements through a competent guide , although one may live in Seville many months and never even see one of these much-heralded musical instruments of Old Spain . The adventurous sojourner may smile at and be haughtily snubbed by a Spanish beauty ' on the steps of the Cathedral , and a week later have that smile thrice acknowledged by the same beauty lingering beneath a rose-twined tree . He may see small boys of downcast demeanor bearing torches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next afternoon hear those same youths demanding hoarsely that they " kill the bullfighter . " He may see Seville in all her beauty and charm and utter fascination , with every day a jewel of sunshine , every orange tree a golden storehouse , and every other tree merely an excuse for climbing blossoms , every breath made sweet with a profusion of the fragrance that comes from budding , flowering life . But he wo n't see amorous youths lingering in the moonlight ' neath grilled balconies , with accommodating companions near by handling the guitar , because they 'll all probably be on the ballroom floor at the Alfonso XIH Hotel , dancing with girls who are rapidly coming to appreciate the limitations of grilled windows ; and the music will he furnished by a jazz orchestra imported from Biarritz or Monte Carlo .

The winter visitor will find a cold , raw Seville , shivering behind closed shutters . which are nevertheless powerless to keep out icy blasts that come sweeping through open patios into stoveless houses ; will smell the acrid reek that comes from laboring olive-oil refineries and the somewhat more endurable odor from orange-pressing plants ; will meet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninviting . overcoated .
