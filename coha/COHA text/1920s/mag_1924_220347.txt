Mr. Powys as a Mumbo-Jumbo-Brummel <P> This book takes no text ; it employs no plot to give it body , no characters to give it blood and spirit . Its subject is the continent of Africa ; and its strangeness proves once more the truth of an ancient apothegm concerning truth and fiction . Written in the manner of a novel and cast in the pattern of a travelogue , it belongs to that obscure hinterland of literature that W. H. Hudson visited in Green Mansions and Defoe , to a certain extent , in Robinson Crusoe . <P> Africa is a harsh nursery for receptive natures . The author had to reconcile his to the task of keeping in order some sheep and some natives- a task which included counting , shearing , earmarking , castrating the former ; humoring , doctoring , whipping , burying the latter . This was itself taxing for a young and literary Englishman- a Beau Brummel in khaki pants and red shirt , exiled from home because of ill-health . There were compensating novelties . For instance , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in a disused woodshed while a lion drank from a reservoir outside his door ; later , he put down a native riot , shot a hippopotamus , trapped a lion , was hoodooed by a witch-doctor , barely escaped being trampled by a herd of wild elephants . <P> At another time Mr. Powys had accused an African " Man of God " of stealing goats and had been heartily cursed in return . That night , as he lay in the dark , he heard a ghastly laugh , he writes , " long and loud , whining and wailing up from the forest , up from the gully , so I judged . I tried to reassure myself . Surely it was the howl of a hyena feasting on the remains of the dead buck ? But even as my mind was suggesting this , my subconscious self knew that it lied . That criminal human outcry , it could issue from no animal throat . . . . Somewhere out where the hispid branches swayed , I know there was a man with white canine teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . . . then gradually I began to realize that the room had become filled with an extraordinary odor , an odor of putrifying blood and rotting flesh , the odor and breath of a hyena . " When day comes he looks out and sees " stamped in the dust of the threshold , two indents- one the footprint of a man ; and the other the padded dog 's spoor of an erect hyena . I knelt and examined them both closely . There was no mistake about it . One foot was a foot with toes ; the other a foot with claws ! " <P> Such experiences as this have a novel ring , but they are not totally unfamiliar ; others have undergone them , written about them , cinematized them . <P> The difference between these people and Mr. Powys lies in the fact that the latter is an artist . His book is in formed with the spirit of Africa as with a sensible presence , is haunted with the shadow of that jungle in whose twilight incredible beasts wage their truceless wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the swinging constellations of the Cross- constellations that see , here and there , man 's fugitive campfires , how dwarfed in that illimitable waste ! Reading , one can almost detect an odor , acrid , animal , exciting - the smell of Africa .
