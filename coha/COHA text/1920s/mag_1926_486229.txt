HOWEVER THE FALL-DOHENY TRIAL ends , the Navy Department stands guilty . The defense centered around an alleged war scare which was supposed to excuse the deal by which Doheny got the oil lands . Secretary Wilbur would not permit Admiral Robison to give - details or name the Power , but everyone knew it was Japan . Now , these scare stories date from the days of and after the - Washington Conference , at which Japan canceled her alliance with England , canceled the Lansing-Ishii agreement - with America , agreed to return Shantung to China , and entered into a series of treaties to safeguard peace and the - status quo in the Pacific . That conference caused a marked lessening of tension in the Pacific . Any war scare , at that - precise time , was the purest bogy-man . We do not pretend - to know whether Mr. Doheny invented the bugaboo in order to get his oil or whether there really were naval officers foolish enough to believe it . Enough has already been hinted to do a deal of damage to Japanese-American relations . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Mr . Wilbur ! And is it not time for Mr. Hughes , father of - the Washington Conference , to speak out ? GOVERNOR SMITH has won fresh laurels in the waterpower fight in that he compelled by ten days of publicity - the New York State Water-Power Commission , which is about to go out of existence , to forego its plans to lease the St. Lawrence River to the Aluminum Trust and allied interests . When the commission met on December 8 at the meeting at which it was to have given its approval to the proposed lease to the Frontier Corporation , Which is jointly owned by the Aluminum Company of America , the Dupont interests , and the General Electric Company , the corporation itself wisely withdrew its acceptance of the proposed plan . On the following day the Northeastern Power Corporation withdrew its application for the creation of a river-regulating district on the Salmon River , which meant a power site on that-river within the forest preserves . This is a magnificent victory , and not only for the Governor . The New York World again deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in so rapid a rousing of public opinion . The Water-Power Commission can now die an ignominious death , the Republican Party in the State of New York has once more thoroughly besmirched itself , and Governor Smith more than ever ranks as a defender of public rights . Will the Republicans now dare to oppose Governor Smith 's program for a State Power Authority to take the State 's " white coal " out of the hands of politicians ? THOUGH THE NUMBER OF MEN of courage and of zeal for truth and justice is steadily increasing in the South  --  witness the splendid fight made by R. Charlton Wright , publisher of the Columbia , South Carolina , Record , to bring about the punishment of the lynchers who butchered the three Negroes in Aiken on October 8 ? it is not often that a Southern man gets up before a Southern audience and says that " highfalutin talk about the beauty of Southern women and the chivalry of Southern men " can not hide the lack of intellectual , artistic , social , and political progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual dinner of the New York Southern Society , and uttered among other reasonable sentiments the following : " The solidarity of the South is no longer a source of pride , but a humiliation to many of its most devoted men " ; " the Southern States are still at the bottom of all statistics that register actual educational conditions of this country " ; " it is also true that there is not a single university in the South that has adequate resources for the highest type of graduate work " ; " even in politics an increasing number of business men ( of the South ) are no longer voting one way and praying another , but are following the dictates of their consciences and patriotism . " He was equally outspoken in his opposition to Tennessee 's anti-evolution law , which he described as the child of " political cowardice . " He pointed out that the State of Georgia has recently sent to the penitentiary for from four years to life the leaders of a lynching mob , to date eleven men . This makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Julian Harris in Georgia , Charlton Wright in South Carolina , and Desha Breckinridge in Kentucky , to cite only a few , to fight their unending battles for justice . A LL HONOR TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS of the University of Utah ! The Chamber of Commerce of Salt Lake City , the Commercial Club , the American Legion , and the usual list of patriotic societies recently undertook to prevent Scott Nearing from giving an address in connection with the University Extension course . He is and was a pacifist , a member of the Civil Liberties Union , a Socialist , and he opposed the entrance of the United States into the World War . Therefore these solemn bodies opined that it was their sacred duty to censor the course of lectures established by the university , and notified its authorities that in their judgment - the mere presence of Scott Nearing , no matter how mild his utterances might be , would be " harmful to the university students . " Wonderful to relate , the Governor of the State and the Mayor of Salt Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , and when the protests of the Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated organizations came before the Board of Regents they unanimously voted to keep Scott Nearing on their roll of lecturers . We can not too warmly commend this action . For a university board of control to allow commercial organizations to say what shall and what shall not be said on university platforms would be to abdicate the most sacred of their functions . The net result was , of course , that the Babbitts of Salt Lake so boomed Mr. Nearing 's coming that it was necessary to take for his lecture the large Assembly Hall of the Mormon church . T HE GOOD OLD DAYS in which a vote was worth two bits and no more  --  unless it might be a glass of whiskey  --  are gone forever . Votes come higher nowadays ; Senator-elect Vare has discovered how costly a Pennsylvania primary can be . And the voters of that State are discovering  --  although so far with no great show of indignation  --  that buying votes is not enough . Other subterfuges may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the investigation of the Philadelphia system discovered one vote recorded as cast by a man who died ten days before the election was held , and in one session of the court twenty-five witnesses testified that their votes had been falsely counted for Vare . Five members of one election board are already under arrest for fraud . In thirty districts of Philadelphia not one vote was counted for William B. Wilson , Vare 's opponent . What is to be the outcome of this scandalous buying and stealing of votes ? The Senate certainly should refuse to seat Senator Vare . But what are the people of Pennsylvania going to do ? Nothing daunted by disclosures relating to their three-million-dollar primary , they elected the machine candidate in November . Or are they about to prove that they did not elect him and that he won the election by fraud alone ? A MONG THE ANNUAL REPORTS of the Cabinet officers the Postmaster General 's stands out- as the most striking , for he reports that he has cut his last year 's deficit in half , reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of an increase of more than $70,000,000 in the salary roll . There was an increase of 9.36 per cent in postage paid on mail , and the air mail earned $861,865.05 in excess of ordinary postal rates . Among the Postmaster General 's commendable recommendations for legislation are one to exclude firearms from the mail , another to contract for group life-insurance for postal employees , and a third to reduce the postage rate on second-class transient matter . All of which shows clearly that if the Post Office Department is ever put on a purely business basis and the Postmaster General dropped from the Cabinet , where he has for generations been merely the political henchman of the President , the department can be made self-supporting . As for the other reports , those of the War and Navy departments are , as usual , demands for more men and more money , while the Attorney General backs up the President in demanding that the prohibition and anti-trust laws be made more stringent . ITTLE BROTHER DIAZ , down in Nicaragua , has learned something from association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the safest ways to fight an opponent is to call him a Bolshevist . And so , since Mexico has recognized the rival Sacasa regime in Nicaragua  --  and at least Sacasa has more constitutional right to call himself President than Diaz ? Diaz howls loudly that Sacasa and the Mexicans are all Bolshevists . It is absurd . It is still more absurd for the Associated Press to cable 1,500 words of Diaz 's ranting to the United States , and for respectable newspapers to print them . The bulk of Diaz 's propaganda is suspicious . So far , he has proved that Galles has recognized Sacasa , as he should , and that some Mexicans have shipped arms to him . Meanwhile Diaz himself is aided by United States marines and aviators ; our gunboats blockade the ports in his behalf ; our State Department and press associations act as his press agents . It is a vast honor for a man who leaped into the Presidency from an ill-paid job as secretary of an American mining corporation ; and shoddy business for a great nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medieval and modern . A Buddhist priest who attempted to present a petition to the Crown Prince provided himself with a dagger to disembowel himself after so sacrilegious an act ; and the chief of police who did not prevent his reaching the running-board of the royal automobile resigned in shame . On the other hand , Japan 's Farmer-Labor Party has all the modern frills . The right-wing labor unions retired when the new party decided to admit Communists to membership . Oddly , however , it was the strong Peasants ' Union which insisted on including the radicals . Now there will be two labor parties . Between them they represent only 150,000 organized workers , while the latest census figures report 3,128,000 men and 1,562,000 women in industry ( the latter a significantly modern figure ) . In any case , registration under the new Manhood Suffrage Act is proceeding so slowly that Japan may have to fight another election in large part on the old selective franchise . In diplomacy , meanwhile , Japan is ahead of the West . She is actively in negotiation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her methods reveal a thoroughly up-to-date understanding of the farcical art of international intercourse . The Japanese Minister and the Chinese Foreign Minister conferred for three days before China presented her note suggesting revision . Every comma , apparently , was discussed before the note was sent . And even then it was not published ! T HE UPPER SILESIAN municipal elections last month were very unsettling . The Poles had hoped for a decisive victory , and the heavy German vote in the industrial centers was a blow . The absurdly complicated arrangement of frontiers made by the League of Nations to accommodate Poland in 1921 doubtless contributed to the result . The rural vote went Polish , but the six chief industrial towns and districts turned in 165,000 votes for the German party , 132,000 for Polish candidates , and 9,200 for Communist and mixed candidates . Kattowitz , . the provincial capital , returned 34 Germans and 26 Poles . Five years of Polish propaganda , the prosperity resulting from the British coal strike , suppression and terrorism where needed , and liberal welfare work just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favor . But the tradition of German skill and capital which built up the industry of Upper Silesia ( and incidentally Poland 's interest in this province ) is deep rooted . Moreover , the current dialect , " Wasserpolnisch , " is so much more like German than Polish that in some cases Polish propagandists were forced to address their audiences in German to be understood at all . And the Germans used to good advantage the contrast between social progress in Germany since the revolution and conditions under the Polish dictatorship . M USSOLINI 'S AMBITION to make the Adriatic an Italian lake is stirring the Balkans again . This time he seems to have negotiated a treaty virtually annexing Albania . Naturally , Jugoslavia is alarmed . Not that the Serbs are devoted to the cause of Albanian independence  --  merely that if Mussolini succeeds in pocketing Albania they fail . Albanian revolutions in the last decade have succeeded one another with startling rapidity , and while Italy has gazed fondly on one party Jugoslavia has nursed the other . Nintchitch , the habitual Foreign Minister at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial moment old Nikola Pachich , who was Serbia 's Prime Minister in prewar days and has occupied the post intermittently ever since , has died . If Pachich 's death brings Stefan Radich to the helm , as seems possible , it will be almost the veteran 's greatest service to his country . Radich is a Croat , . and his leadership would do much to unite the racial groups of the " Kingdom of the Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes. " -1 NTERALLIED CONTROL " of Germany will cease on January 31 , 1927 . That is good news . The outcome of the Geneva negotiations is a bargain , but a friendly bargain , reinforcing the significantly growing good-will between France and Germany . The control commission , sitting in Berlin and prying into factories all over Germany , has been an irritation from the start . Enforcement of the disarmament provisions of the Treaty of Versailles is to be turned over to the League Council . That body too may have to settle the moot questions of the German fortifications in the East and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Both these questions go to the Council if the Conference of Ambassadors can not settle them ; Germany 's proposal to refer them for arbitration to the World Court at the Hague was refused  --  because , the correspondent of the New York Times avows , the members of the League Council have " a better idea of what was in the minds of the persons who drafted the Treaty of Versailles . " It is bad business to tie the League to that treaty . T HE HALL-STEVENS FAMILY have been acquitted . In most civilized countries private persons unjustly accused of crime may be indemnified from the public treasury . The British Parliament appropriated ? 5,000 in the Beck case . Wisconsin and California allow an indemnity not to exceed 85,000 in any case of erroneous conviction of a completely innocent party . France , making concrete Voltaire 's proposal , also confines the indemnity to persons unjustly convicted . But Germany , Austria , Hungary , Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Portugal , and many of the Swiss cantons permit a wrongfully accused person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has borne . This is civilized . The state in the public interest of prosecuting crime takes from an innocent person his liberty and lays on him an extraordinary expense . The people of the state should bear in common a loss which they have unjustly imposed on a single individual . The indemnity also helps to reestablish a person 's unjustly impugned reputation in the community . Our States should take up this matter by general legislation . A federal bill , making the United States responsible in case of erroneous conviction in the federal courts , introduced in 1913 by Senator Sutherland , now justice of the Supreme Court , was lost in the excitement incident to the war . Such a humanitarian measure should be revived . I N THE SURVEY GRAPHIC 'S long list of distinguished . issues none is more stimulating or more provocative of thought and discussion than the recent number on " Woman 's Place , " edited by Mary Ross . Here we have an impressive summary of the results so far of the Women 's Revolution , which may mark the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social change . The emotional conflicts that confront the modern woman , the profound choices that are forced upon her , the subtle interactions in home life , in the relations of the sexes , in factory and office are here discussed lightly yet with informed wisdom . If the issue is free of merely spectacular testimony it is even more amazingly free of simple and general dicta . It is concrete and particular and balanced ; if it appears partisan to the modern woman its bias is mainly a record of the way of life that the present and the future seem to offer . It is a fascinating textbook of woman in the modern world  --  worth keeping , after reading , as an historical document to look over in later years when women shall have found their sea legs and the impressive activities of the advancing women of today will seem like the earnest and awkward yet somehow promising movements of a landlubber on his first day out . TF THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE had reached down and arrested the policemen who , on December 12 , arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1798 law against working on Sunday , it would have been appropriate . For the policemen , too , surely violated the law in performing their labors . They arrested bus-drivers , trolley conductors , merchants , gasoline vendors , bootblacks , and even the reporters and photographers who , for hire , had assembled to catch a news story . But nobody arrested the officers of the law or Recorder Frederic Stoddard , who fined each law-breaker  --  except himself and the policemen  --  two dollars . Clarence Darrow , who , at a recent Nation dinner , declared that the way to change an unpopular law is to disobey it , is thus proved both right and wrong . For the Blue Laws have certainly not been obeyed ; for a full century they have been blandly , openly , and persistently ignored . Yet when , as in Irvington last Sunday , they are obeyed their absurdity becomes so evident that they must surely be brought nearer to repeal than by a century of neglect .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
