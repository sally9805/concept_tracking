txt The Sixtyeighth Congress , which , in the opinion of old-time Washington observers , IS destined to be one of the most interesting in the history of the nation . will convene at noon tomorrow , with neither of the old parties having an actual maPrity , and the Radical groups holding the balance of power in each house . In the Senate . with the acquiescence of the Democrats , the regular Repub/leans , as matters stand tonight , will be Permitted promptly to organize that chamber . In the House . however , the insurgents of the La Follette school are threatening a bolt , and in that event the organization of the House tomorrow is doubtful . Whether President Coolidge will deliver his message on Wednesday is uncertain because of the situation in the House , for until both houses are duly organized the President 's message must remain undelivered . It can be presented only to a joint session of both houses Administration leaders are busy tonight trying to work out some sort of a compromise that will be acceptable to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is believed to be liberal concessions in the way of committee appointments . It is a bitter Pill Pr the Administration* forces , but , as things look now , it must be swallowed if the It use is to be organized Quickly . One of the real leaders of the Radical group declared today that its members would not continue recalcitrant tactics to such an extent as to prevent the House organizing in time to hear the President 's message on Wednesday . The group , this leader asserted , will permit organization possibly tomorrow , and certainly not later than Tuesday . After organization , however , the Radicals will reshape their fight for a revision of the rules to permit of the disc charge of committees by 150 members signing a petition . Other proposals for liberalization of the rules will be offered and these , the Radicals assert tonight , they can win with the support of the Vernet-Lats . Nelson Speaks for Radicals . T.ie policy of the Radical bloc was indicated in a statement made today by its chairman , John M. Nelson , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the same Old Guard and under the same old cry . ' Hail , hail , the gang 's all here . ' The gentlemen who are running Congress have buried their heads . in the sand , like ostriches , refusing to recognize that the Republican majority in the House was reduced from 169 to 17 and the Republican maj ) rity of 7,000. - 000 was entirely wiped out by the voters because of the arbitrary , dominating , high-handed , reactionary manner in Which they conducted the past Congress . " The business of Congress has been conducted by picked committees , prat : - ; ideally perpetuating themselves . Conrgress itself can not act upon any measure unless the Steering Committee wishes to let Congress act . The most important legislation affecting the life of the nation ( - in be held up by the Steering Committee and Congress is absolutely powerless to bring it forth . Committee chairmen may tuck important bills into their pockets when introduced and keep them there until the session has adjourned . Under the House rules committees can defeat the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform the people of the attitude of the Congressmen they elect to serve , not to rule them . We are fighting to change these rules . " Presidents Washington . Jefferson and the other founeers of our governmental system had intended that the business of the nation should be transacted in the open under the full light lof publicity  --  never in the semi-gloom of the committee room . We protested ) at the election against the continuance rot those practices and the people gave Us the ' balance of power , ' which we intend to losein compliance with the mandate given the Republican Party . " The opening manoeuvres of the Old Guard leaders indicate promises of con- , ' tinuetrSereice to the railroad manipulators , grain gamblers , coal operators 8nd-influential tax dodgers , but none to retain a lobby that serves as the - liaison between these secret committees ' End the favored interests . The Old Guard will soon wake up , rub their e3ieS , and learn that we are living in a fnew day . " New Party Lenders . The new Congress finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican leader in the House , Senator S:lobinson of Arkansas succeeding Senator Underwood in the Senate and Representative Longworth of Ohio taking the place of Mr. Mondell of Wyoming , who eras defeated in November , 1922 , The organization fight in the House Asia centre on the Speakership unless a settlement is reached . Mr. Gillett , the Speaker of the last CongTess , according to the caucus vote of yesterday , is short about eighteen votes of the number needed to elect . He has 190 votes in ' ight. and 20S. if all the Democrats stand solidly behind Mr. Garrett  --  and a , 11 indications are that they will  --  will bdnecessary to put Mr. Gillett into the chair . Neither house is expected to transact any business tomorrow and both are expected to adjourn soon as a tribute to the memory of Senators and Representatives who have died since March 4 last , the final day of the Sixty-seventh Congress . ' The Senate is expected speedily to effect its organization and then adjourn cut of respect to the memory of Senators Nelson of Minnesota . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honor of President Harding will follow the delivery of President Coolidge 's message . N ew Heads for Financial Committees . The two great financial committees , before which will come the tax and bonus problems , will function under new chairmen in this Congress . Senator Smoot will be the new head of the Committee on Finance , while Representative William R. Green of Iowa succeeds to the chairmanship of the Committee on Ways and Means . As all legislation involving finances must originate in the House , the Committee on Ways and Means is expected to begin consideration of the Mellon tax reduction plan within the next few days , and if the soldiers ' adjusted compensation lobby has its way , the framing of a bonus bill will not be long delayed . The Mellon tax proposition will be the big issue before the new Congress . The bonus problem is certain to be injected into the discussion , and every effort will be made by the bonus advocates in the two Houses to rush a bonus through either as an amendment to a tax reduction plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reducing the taxes on small incomes will have'little , if any . oppositon . The tight will be directed against proposed cuts in then higher brackets . The Radicals and so-called Progressives , according to their present pro-gram , will fight any move to lower the tall on large incomes . They are expected to make a fight for restoration of the excess profits tax and increase of inheritance taxes . They will argue that this will make possible the reduction of the tax burdens of those with small incomes and at the same time make possible the payment of billions to the exsoldiers in the form of a bonus . That the Congress will pass some sort of a tax redaction measure- appears certain . Whether it will be one which will meet the approval of the Administration , which is standing behind the Mellon plan , remains to be seen . It also seems assured that a bonus bill will be 1 , assed , and if the President vetoes the bill , its advocates claim they have enough votes to pass it over the veto . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , and if the I ue comes the fight will be in the Senate , which in the last Congress sustained President Harding when he vetoed the Fordney-McCumber Adjusted Compensation bill . Just how the indications are for a close vote in the Senate , with the odds on the side of those Who are demanding bonus legislation . Other legislation of major importance coming before the new Congress will involve the railroads , agriculture and immigration . The conservatives will fight any radical legislation directed against the transportation systems . In both Houses there are strong groups which are demanding that the Esch-Cummins law be revised , while the more radical elements are urging its outright repeal . The lowering of freight rates will be demanded in both Houses , and this nroposition is certain of strong support from the ranks of all parties . All the signs are for a lively legislative year , so far as the rail systems of the couna re concerned . There will be a battle to change the Immigration laws , especially the restrictive features . The outlook is for the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , with its 3 per cent , restrictive clause . Tariff Revision Unlikely ' . It is not believed that any move to revise the tariff law will be successful . Neither is it believed that any effort will be made to revive the ship subsidy issue . Owing to the greatly increased Democratic membership in both houses . It is doubtful if any serious move will be made to pass the anti-lynching bill , which was filibustered to its death by the Senate Democrats in the last Congress . Other , matters which will come before the new Congress will include the disposition of Muscle Shoals , which involves the acceptance or rejection of Henry Ford 's offer for the great power plant ; the Truth-in-Fabric bill , which is sponsored by the farm bloc ; a bill to fix the price of wheat ; a crop insurance proposition and a bill for the conservation of the forests . In the Senate the World Court issue probably will come to the front again and , if " brought to a vote , the proposition probably will be ratified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will be a fight against ratification of the Lausanne treaty with the Turkish Angora Government , which abolishes the right of foreigners in Turkey to be tried in their own Consular courts and other privileges not accorded to Turkish citizens . More than 200 Presidential appointments await the confirmation of the Senate . They include the nominations of Frank B. Kellogg to be Ambassador to Great Britain , Richard Tobin to be Minister to the Netherlands , Garrard B. Winston to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury . Henry M. Dawes to be Controller of the Currency and J. Walter Drake to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce . There probably will be some opposition to the confirmation of Mr. Kellogg . but it will be confined to - the Radicals and will not be sufficient ' o deprive him of his Ambassadorship . It is considered certain that Walter Cohen , nominated to be Controller of Customs at New Orleans , will be rejected , as he was in the last Congress .                   @ @
