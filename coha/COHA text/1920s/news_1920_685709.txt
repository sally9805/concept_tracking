txt Setting Aside " Honest Differences . " To the Editor of The New York Times : I have read the Republican and Democratic Platforms , the keynote and notification speeches , and the speeches of acceptance . In all of this mushroom literature there is not one paragraph more thought-provolting , and at the same time amusing , than the following , taken from Lodge 's keynote speech ' in which he excommunicates the President of the American people : " Let past dissensions among us be relegated to history and forgotten by us ; let all honest differences as to means and methods , if there be such , be set aside until November , in order that the great and overruling purpose in which wo all agree and which we long to achieve may be attained .

If we can make the people believe that in the League of Nations they will have to send their sons overseas to put down a . rebellion in Punjab for England , let 's do it . Let 's do it , folks ! We have already been beaten twice , and  --  we are hungry for office . " M. R. KUEHN . Newark , Ohio , Aug. 26 , I920.
