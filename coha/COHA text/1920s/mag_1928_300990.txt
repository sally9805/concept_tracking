Rumania has been ruled by Tycoons of the Bratiano family since the foundation of the Kingdom ( 1881 ) . The Royal Family has merely reigned-a family of puppets-despite the petty intrigues of Queen Marie . Therefore the Kingdom was shaken in its deepest political foundations , last week , when the last of the Tycoons , Vintila Bratiano , was forced to resign as Prime Minister . <P> The situation can not be grasped without harking back a year to the Prime Ministry of Vintila Bratiano 's late brother , the great Jon Bratiano . He it was who daringly altered the Royal succession and placed upon the Throne a baby King , Mihai I ( TIME , Aug. 1 , 1927 ) . This stroke of statecraft was designed to maintain the power of the Tycoons unchallenged until the baby king grew up . To make doubly sure , Jon Bratiano set up a Regency of two old men and a youth , all denounced by the Parliamentary Opposition as puppets . <P> So far so excellent , but then to Jon Bratiano came sudden Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last week was that it was the Regency , hand picked by Jon Bratiano , which demanded that his brother , Prime Minister Vintila Bratiano resign on or before Dec. 1 , 1928 . Naturally the insulted Tycoon resigned next morning , after an all night session of his Cabinet . The most ominous feature of the situation is that Vintila Bratiano has been for many years Finance Minister and has conducted single handed the negotiations with international financiers for a $250,000,000 loan to Rumania-a project now complete in all its details and on the very verge of consummation . <P> The Regency apparently acted in the belief that Peasant Leader Juliu Maniu , who staged gigantic mass demonstrations last spring ( TIME , March 26 ) , might attempt a revolution or coup d ' tat capable of toppling down not only the Tycoon but the Throne . To forestall this the Regency proposed to call Peasant Maniu to the Prime Ministry . So cataclysmic were events in Rumania , last week , that any prediction seemed mere folly . The fact that international financiers will now almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regency recalls Vintila Bratiano to the Prime Ministry , seemed the chief indication that Rumania 's ousted Tycoon may be down , not out .
