With the liner Bremen , world 's third longest , just starting on her maiden voyage ( see page 21 ) came last week the announcement that United States Lines , Inc. , was planning two new liners longer even than the 938 foot Bremen . They will each be approximately 950 feet long , said Joseph Sheedy , who is operating U. S. Lines , Inc. , for Paul Chapman . Each will accommodate 4,000 passengers .
