Well known in Illinois was Lee O'Neil Browne , able lawyer , long a member of the Legislature . His friendly neighbors in Ottawa , Ill. , would point out his fine early-American brick mansion , standing proudly on the bluff that overhangs the Fox River . <P> Lately , Mr. Browne achieved new prominence as defense counsel in a case of matricide . But not his legal abilities , not his services as lawmaker for the farmers around Ottawa , were what the press of the nation remembered last week about Mr. Browne . <P> " He came to national attention , " said the press , " during the Lorimer election to the U. S. Senate in 1909 . Four Representatives confessed that they had received $1,000 bribes from Mr. Browne to vote for Lorimer . Mr. Browne was tried twice for bribery but was finally acquitted . " <P> Such was the epitaph awaiting Lee O'Neil Browne when , last week , stooping to avoid a low branch , he made a misstep on the narrow stone path at the edge of his bluff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters whirled along half a mile ( to their junction with the Illinois River ) before " yielding the body .
