Wise men have said that if any Republican , at any time during this campaign , should make any overt insinuation against Mrs. Smith 's social fitness for the White House , it would be touching off political dynamite . <P> Frederick H. Gillett , the white-goateed junior Senator from Massachusetts , made a speech a fortnight ago to a band of Republican women workers gathered in the Hotel Kimball at Springfield , Mass . He said : " It is at gatherings like these that we must sow the seeds which will win the election . " He proceeded to comment on Nominee Smith 's appeal for " a certain class or element of citizens . " <P> Senator Gillett also described for the ladies of Springfield the charm , culture , intelligence of his friend , Mrs. Herbert Hoover . Then he said : " Of course , I can not say very much of Mrs. Smith , because I have never known her , but if the contest was between Mrs. Hoover and Mrs. Smith-He did not finish the sentence but the Republican ladies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Senator Gillett 's " seed " speech was duly reported in the reliable Springfield Republican , oldtime Bible of many a G. 0 . Politician . The " seed " about Mrs. Smith soon brought forth hot letters from Massachusetts Democrats . The Republican newsman , George E. Pelletier , who had reported Senator Gillett 's remarks , called on the Senator to see if he would like to end the unfinished sentence about Mrs. Smith . The Senator said he did not exactly recall what he had said , that it was unimportant anyway . <P> There the thing might have stopped but for the alert New York Times , which reprinted Senator Gillett 's unfinished sentence in an editorial and roundly flayed him for " vulgarity and stupidity ... execrable taste . . . political blunder . . . folly . . . impropriety . . . unchivalrous . . . offensive . . . underground propaganda . " <P> Senator Gillett wrote to the New York Times : " The words and insinuation you ascribe to me I neither uttered nor conceived . . . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a harmless remark . " <P> Sharp-eyed Newsman Pelletier saw the Senator 's letter in the Times and last week wrote a letter himself . He told the Times about calling on the Seed-Sower and concluded with all the indignation of an upright journalist : " . . . It is the first time the charge of ' misquoted ' has been aimed at me and it is baseless , even though it comes from a Senator . "
