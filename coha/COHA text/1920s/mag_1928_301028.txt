Whoever has traveled on electrified railroads can appreciate last week 's decision of the Pennsylvania Railroad to electrify its 11,000 miles of track . <P> The Pennsy already operates an electrified suburban service out of Philadelphia . This is similar to the suburban lines of the Illinois Central at Chicago . <P> The Pennsy terminal at Manhattan is also electrified . Steam trains can not linger underground in the tunnels that Manhattan traffic necessitates . So from Hell Gate , where the Pennsylvania connects with New England lines , to Manhattan Transfer in New Jersey , where steam locomotives replace electric ones for the long Pennsylvania hauls south and west , and to Long Island City where the Pennsy 's Long Island trains change from electricity to steam-within all that great triangle electric locomotives haul the cars . For the same reason at Manhattan the New York Central hauls its trains by electricity to Harmon and the New York , New Haven &; Hartford to New Haven . <P> The Pennsy 's new project is to spend $100,000,000 the next seven or eight years electrifying its 325 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wilmington . At Wilmington connection will be made with the Philadelphia electric lines . Thence the lines will eventually run westward through Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh district , which soon will be electrified as are Philadelphia and Manhattan . <P> The 1,300 Manhattan-Wilmington miles of track will be the longest railroad electrification unit in the country . The St. Paul . whose partial electrification contributed most to that road 's bankruptcy three years ago , has a total 646 miles of track . The Norfolk &; Western , which carries coal across the Cumberland Mountains , has 77 miles of electrified track . The coal-carrying Virginian in the same territory has 231 miles . <P> But the Pennsy is not sole in its extensive plans . The New York Central a few months ago consulted with General Electric to electrify its tracks along the Hudson River from Manhattan towards Albany , and mayhap to Buffalo . And practically every other large system has plans , more or less detailed , in the same vein .                @ @ @ @ @
