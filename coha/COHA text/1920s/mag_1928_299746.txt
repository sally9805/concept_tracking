Mexicans were among those puzzled when a certain President said : " I do not choose . . . . " <P> President Plutarco Elias Calles of Mexico said last week : <P> " I have decided to declare in solemnity and with such clearness that my words may not be misinterpreted , that I shall not seek the prolongation of my term , either by accepting prorogue of office or by accepting the appointment of Provisional President . . . . Never for any reason or under any circumstances shall I return to the Presidency . <P> " This does not mean the remotest intention on my part of abandoning civic duties nor retirement from the life of struggle and responsibility which are the lot of every soldier . I know there are plenty of situations in the military , administrative , political , or civic field which I can occupy and which no matter how modest they may seem in comparison with the Presidency I now hold . . . could give me opportunity to discharge my duties as a man of the revolution . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Congress of Mexico , in the presence of 22 Divisional Generals , 16 Governors of Mexican States and the Diplomatic Corps . Not since the glamorous days of Dictator Porfirio Diaz has Mexico City been the scene of a spectacle so imposing and resplendent . <P> The Congress had met to deal with the grave crisis resulting from the recent assassination of President-Elect Alvaro Obregon ( TIME , July 30 ) . Until President Calles mounted the Tribune and began his 5,000-word address , Mexicans were half persuaded that he would attempt to succeed himself as President , though Mexico 's Constitution forbids . <P> Calles has been called a Dictator , as was Obregon , as have been most Presidents of Mexico . Therefore the Nation was moved in the very depths of its emotional being , last week , when President Calles said : " For the first time in Mexican history the Republic faces a situation whose dominant note is the lack of a leader of military power . . . . This is the most solemn hour of our national life . ... I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one man to a government of institutions . ... It is useless to seek an outstanding or dictatorial person . May I say there are none ! . . . <P> " It is no longer the man but the exaltation of the law that must be our source of strength . ... I need not say that I should not advise legality for legality 's sake , forgetful of the national needs or the real condition of the country . " President Calles then indicated that he advises the legal election to Congress , without obstruction from the party in power , of representatives of all opposition factions-a thing unheard of up to now in Mexico . " My advice , " he continued , " is based on my conviction that admitting into Congress representatives from reactionary groups , even from clerical reactionaries should not alarm true revolutionaries , * because if we all have faith , as I have , that our new ideas are now shared by the great majority of the Mexican people . . . then we must know that the electoral districts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men representing the advanced social movement in Mexico must be for a long time to come in the minority .
