Prohibition officials in southern Florida last week published a new recipe for getting drunk-a recipe that worried them because they could not see how to stop it . The recipe : into one coconut , bore a hole . Letting no milk leak out , insert two teaspoonfuls of brown sugar , followed by a cork . Refrain from touching the coconut for three weeks . Result : a tumblerful of cocowhiskey-pungent , potent , popular in southern Florida .
