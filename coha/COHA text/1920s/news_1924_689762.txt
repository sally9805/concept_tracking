The City Council today approved a salary of $15,000 instead of $12,000 as proposed for General Butler , acting on the plea of Mayor Kendrick .

" In the case of Lieutenant Graham my sympathies were touched , but I felt that I had no alternative but to replace him .

On his own admission he is not strong . enough to cope with the demands of his office . 11 ? is eligible to pension and should retire .

" The Mayor did not ask me to reverse my decision or try to bring any pressure1 to bear on ' me , " said the General . " I had intended to give them every chance to clear themselves and the Mayor backed me up . If both these men can prove they were on duty the night I made my visit , their case will be reconsidered . I will not say whether they will be retained as lieutenants or not .

Now a man has a right to take his night off , but I thought that a Lieutenant who had his work at heart would forego his night off at a time when we were trying to clean the city up in fortyeight hours . It looked like rank indifference to their work . " Both of these men , however , swear that they did not take the night off , but were on duty somewhere in their district . They will be suspended during an investigation as to the truth of their stories . We want to be careful not to do any injustice during this clean-up .

" The police found no liquor in this place , " he said . " When the police act unlawfully they will be held to strict accountability . The police have no right to make raids contrary to law . If Butler is sincere , he will raid homes of the rich and clubs where there is plenty of liquor stored in the lockers . ' , Every part of Philadelphia saw unprecedented police activity . Cigar stores , saloons , poolrooms , and other establishments were raided . Scores of arrests were made in various parts of the city , the police carrying on their clean-up crusade as actively in outlying districts as they did downtown .
