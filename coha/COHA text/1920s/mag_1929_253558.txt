The Staatsoper in Vienna , last week , received a big bundle labeled by the Austrian customs " clothes and horse harness . " Opened , the bundle proved to be the complete outfit of a U. S. cowgirl , sent by Richard Schweppe of Los Angeles . Mr. Schweppe is vice president of the Los Angeles Civic Grand Opera Company . In a letter to the Staatsoper , he explained that , ever since seeing Soprano Maria Jeritza last spring in Vienna in Puccini 's Girl of the Golden West , he had been disturbed by inaccuracies in her costume and unable to resist sending a genuine one .
