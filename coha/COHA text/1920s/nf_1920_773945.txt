txt // the Senate , on January 24 , 1918 , in which the Senator spoke as follows : " Let us now consider the question of rifles . " We were furnishing Lee-Enfield rifles to the British Government in large numbers . The factories were prepared for them . It is true that Great Britain was trying to make an improvement upon the rifles used by her when she became involved in the war , but when the war came on Great Britain said we will not waste any time improving our rifles , but will get them out just as fast as we can , and they have been manufacturing them ever since . What did America do ? With 700,000 rifles in America and in our colonial possessions , a motley group of different kinds of grins , America was seeking , through the Ordnance Department , to improve the rifle that Great Britain was manufacturing here and which we could have put out without any trouble in the factories . We went to work , through the Ordnance Department , to improve the Enfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great improvement . I believe it is a better gun than the English gun , but here while the house was burning America was determining through its Ordnance Department what instrumentalities ought to be adopted to put out the fire . It took weeks and months before they finally got the Lee-Enfield rifle into condition where the Ordnance Department thought it was all right . And after this was agreed upon there were further delays caused by indecision . IIere were the engineers of these great arms companies , who got together and finally agreed upon a program for the manufacture of // these guns , and concluded that they would manufacture them with seven interchangeable parts , and they started to manufacture the gauges , the jigs , and dies , and everything necessary for the manufacture of guns with seven interchangeable parts . After the Ordnance Department had practically accepted the suggestion , it went to work through a distinguished ordnance officer and changed the plan from 7 to 40 interchangeable parts , and finally raised it to over 50 interchangeable parts , with the result that everything had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . This may have resulted in improvement , but why the delay in the midst of the smoke of battle ? " Senator Chamberlain 's position as Chairman of the Military Committee , and the fact that his speech followed an extensive investigation of the War Department by the Committee , gave to his utterances a particularly important character , and caused them to be very widely published throughout the country , undoubtedly to the considerable impairment of the public confidence in the manner in which this important matter of rifles had been handled by the department . Senator Weeks , also of the Committee , joined in a criticism of the department , saying in regard to myself , " He had constantly sought ? justifiably so in ordinary times ? for the best the market could produce , and in this case he was unwilling to modify that standard of perfection even though a modification would have greatly hastened the production of a satisfactory arm , and one which would have answered all purposes . " After review62 ORDNANCE AND THE WORLD WAR ing some of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator continued : " But all of these arguments in favor of the change did not commence to overcome the advantage of immediately providing the largest supply of rifles possible ? a rifle which has served England satisfactorily during three years of actual warfare . " There was very little military support of the position of these two Senators that was ever brought to my notice . I knew of but one officer , General Leonard Wood , then commanding the Department of the East , who held the view that we should have continued the manufacture of the Enfield rifle as it was being made at the time of our entry into the war , should have armed our troops abroad entirely with it , and should have used the British ammunition . He gave these views in an official recommendation to the War Department , and perhaps based them on an exaggerated estimate of the number of rifles required to make wastage good , which had appeared in the newspapers . Ills reconnnendation was for supply at the rate of five rifles per man , while the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle per man was a sufficient allowance for a year 's wastage . It was claimed by the advocates of the exclusive use of the British caliber and the British ammunition that it would diminish by one the number of different kinds of small arms ammunition in use by the Allies , by avoiding our introduction of a new type , and would place us in a position to draw upon the British supply in case our own should be inter- // rupted . But before the conclusion was reached that we should modify the Enfield rifle , it had already been decided that our troops were to operate with the French , and not with the British ; and , therefore , the ability to draw upon the British ammunition supply became of less importance . Besides , the small arms ammunition constituted such a minor proportion of the supplies which had to be transported across the ocean that interruption of transportation would have made itself felt in other matters long before it would reach the small arms ammunition . For example , the rifle ammunition supply would not amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , while his food supply , alone , would , at the very least , be four pounds per day , that is , sixteen times as great . The French , with whom we were to and did operate , made no point of our lack of interchangeable rifle ammunition with their troops . No tonnage would have been saved by our use of British ammunition , since the materials for manufacturing the ammunition would , in any case , have had to come from this side . As a matter of fact , the few divisions of our troops which did for a time operate with the British were supplied during the interval with British rifles and ammunition . But great stress has been laid upon the earlier equipment of our troops with rifles which would have resulted from adoption , without change , of the Enfield . This is based upon the assumption that the factories would then have been able to go right ahead turning out several thousand per day , // from the time when they should have finished their British orders . The testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . Mr. Charles H. Schlacks , the General Manager of the largest of the three factories , that at Eddystone , Pennsylvania , testified before the Committee , in December , 1917 , as follows : " The Chairman ? In your opinion , was the progress of manufacture delayed any by the adoption of the new model gun ? " " Mr. Schlacks ? Very slightly , Mr. Chairman , if any , and that is certainly wiped out by the fact that the material manufacturers have not kept pace with us . " But there is probably no doubt that we could have secured from the British Government a large number of the Enfield rifles which had already been manufactured for their service , and therefore we can admit that we should have had a somewhat earlier supply I'or all our troops if we had accepted the rifle as it was . This promptness , however , would have been accompanied by very grave disadvantages . We would have had three makes of rifle in use , of unstandardized manufacture , and with noninterchangeable parts . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of his rifle , could not make use of a similar part from another gun , and his rifle would thus have been made completely unserviceable . One of the manufacturers was permitted to go ahead with his manufacture before he had attained the finally settled degree of interchangeability , under instructions to attain that de- // gree gradually . This brought from the Expeditionary Force in France the following : " The matter of spare parts and maintenance in our present situation is serious and must not be complicated by the addition of any distinctions in manufacture . " The manufacturers , themselves , were all favorable to the change . Mr. S. M. Vauclain , a member of the Advisory Committee of the Council of National Defence , who built the Eddystone rifle factory , and was one of the most experienced business men connected with the manufacture of rifles for the Allied governments , testified as follows before the Senate Military Committee : " Mr. Vauclain ? I consider that the Ordnance Department was very wise in taking the time to perfect this rifle . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is even a better rifle than the Springfield rifle , as it is now made . I might not get everybody to agree with me on that , but there is a longer distance between the sights , and it is a very accurately constructed rifle and should give no trouble in the field . " There is a great objection to using the rim cartridge in the field , on account of jamming when you are working the shot in the rifle . These rifles now have rimless cartridges , the same as used by the Springfield rifle , interchangeable ammunitiwi , absolutely no possibility of jamming in service . Their interchangeability is such that when we were putting English rifles together , if a man put twenty rifles a day together , we thought he had done a good days ' work . About ten days ago one of our fitters Fib ORDNANCE AND THE WORLD WAR put 128 of these rifles together , and 97 per cent of then targeted first shot . If this rifle was not of perfect design and perfectly made as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 128 rifles together in ten hours out of the miscellaneous heap of parts ; so that I am satisfied that the rifles are an absolutely interchangeable piece of work . The other rifle makers are coming along in good shape . The Government plants are also turning out an increased number of rifles . I do not see anything to worry about rifles . " ( Ifearings , page 360 . ) Later experience and wider examination showed the comparative figures of assembly of rifles to be even more striking than as stated by Mr. Vauclain . The best record in the three factories before our entry into the war was the assembly of fifty Enfield rifles in a day by one man , but of the altered and standardized rifle , as it was made for us , the best record became 280 rifles a day , while the average record after the work got well going was 250 rifles a day . The influence of this acceleration of manufacture , both upon the supply and upon the cost , was necessarily very great . The Enfield rifles had cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles cost the United States Government less than $30 apiece . Mr. Vauclain 's testimony continued : " The Chairman ? There has been some feeling that that change in the Lee-Enfield rifle , to modernize it , created great delay in the delivery of the guns , and there is criticism of the Department in the tardiness with which they have produced the // larger ordnance . Do you feel that there is ground for the criticism ? " " Mr. Vauclain ? I do not feel there is . If anything , there is ground for commendation for the manner in which the officers in the Ordnance Department of the Army and Navy have arisen to this situation . It is a tremendous task . It is only those who have lived with it as I have lived with it , day and night , Sundays included ? I have given my entire time to it ? who realize what a tremendous proposition it is . " ( Page 367 . ) Mr. Henry S. Kimball , President of the company which was manufacturing the Enfield rifles at Ilion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one point that I think , perhaps , might be brought out for your benefit . The manufacture of English ammunition at the time war was declared in the United States was reduced to a comparatively small figure . The English contract had run out and had been replaced by other contracts . It would have taken nearly as long ? I think Mr. Tyler will correct me if it is not correct ? to produce English ammunition in quantities as ii has taken us to produce American ammunition in quantities , in the combined resources of the cartridge manufacturers of this country . Therefore , it would have been a serious mistake to build for a large production of an inferior ammunition when in comparatively the same time it was possible to build up for a large production of superior ammunition . Therefore , the ammunition feature was a very large part of the consideration of what arms and // what ammunition should be furnished to our troops . " " The Chairman ? And justified the modification of the rifle ? " " Mr. Kimball ? Absolutely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. J. E. Otterson , Vice-President and General Manager of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company , gave opinions as Follows : " Mr. Otterson ? From the manufacturers ' point of view , and to anyone familiar with the British rifle , it was desirable to change . " ( Page 40G . ) " On the cartridge manufacturing side , the manufacturers could more readily and easily and expeditiously manufacture the United States cartridge than the British cartridge . " ( Page 407 . ) " So , coupling the two things together by making the change , you are getting a superior cartridge and getting a rifle that will function better , and your delay was but about thirty ( lays , and there seemed every reason to change the caliber of the rifles . " ( Page 408 . ) Mr. Otterson , while having no doubt as to the desirability of changing the rifle so as to fire the American ammunition , did . not feel so well qualified to estimate the relative weight of the high degree of interchangeability required by the Department and the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : " Mr. Otterson ? My position as a representative // of the manufacturer at the time was , that while I was not qualified to pass on the necessity for this higher degree of interchangeability , I could say that it would result in delay , and the question was one purely as to whether the exigencies of the situation warranted or permitted delay . ( Page 410 . ) " In the manufacturing and technical sense I was opposed to it and did not consider it worth while . I believe , however , that the necessity for it should rest on the judgment of a military man , and not on the judgment of a manufacturer . " ( Page 422 . ) Mr. Otterson had received a military education , being a graduate of the Naval Academy , but he did not care to trust his judgment as to the military value of a high degree of interchangeability in the rifles ; differing in this from certain gentlemen who , with very indifferent attention to military subjects in the past , were quite ready with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers , in testifying in favor of the changes made in the rifle , were testifying to their own financial disadvantage ; for it is apparent that the earlier the manufacture and delivery of rifles for the United States should commence , the sooner would their profits begin to come in . Because of rather unfortunate experience with the manufacture of rifles for the British Government , they were greatly in need of profits . A very distinct disadvantage of the adoption for our service of the British rifle , as it stood , and the // British ammunition , would have been that it would have left us after the war with several million rifles and several hundred million rounds of ammunition on our hands of types which we did not like , and all the plants fitted for the manufacture of this rifle and ammunition . But even the critics admit that the rifle , as changed , was a much better gun , and the substance of their criticism is that the change was not worth the delay . They do not seem to have appreciated the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ammunition supply ; but the effect of the delay in rifle supply needs a little examination . As stated above , we had on hand at our entry into the war about 600,000 Springfield rifles . Not all of these were in the United States . Some were in the Philippine Islands and some in Panama ; but , since in armies constituted as were those in the European War only about half of the men carry rifles , the number on hand was insufficient for an army of over a million men . We called our men to the colors so fast , however , that in the autumn of 1917 there were infantrymen in the camps and cantonments without rifles ; but , in addition to the Springfields , we had on hand some 160,000 KragJorgensen rifles which were perfectly good guns for training , and these , together with the Springfields , gave a supply for training the soldiers , although not enough to supply a rifle for each man . The shortage , however , was rapidly diminished by the coming on of the modified Enfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed so // fast that the shortage was wiped out in January of 1918 . A great deal was made by the critics of the shortage of rifles in the camps during the early months of mobilization , but it is doubtful whether the matter was as seriously felt in the camps as it was by the critics . The following letter received rrom the Division Ordnance Officer at one of the National Army cantonments throws some light upon this point : " 0 . O. file 354.1/477 DIVISION HEADQUARTERS , December 15 , 1917 . GENERAL WILLIAM CROZIER , Washington , D. C. Sir : In connection with the Congressional inquiry now in progress , I believe some wrong impressions have been created . I submit some facts which may be of use to you so far as this camp is concerned . I presume the conditions are the same , or nearly the same , at all the other National Army camps . 1 . There was no delay in target practice due to lack of Enfield rifles . 2 . Target practice has been in progress for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . Machine guns ( Colt ) were received before troops were ready to use them . 4 . Automatic rifles ( Lewis and Chauchat ) were received before troops were ready to use them . 5 . Machine gun target practice is being held every ( lay the weather permits . // 6 . The supply , at this camp , of all kinds of target practice ammunition for both infantry and light artillery is more than ample . 7 . In my opinion it is almost certain that the troops will be equipped and trained long before ships are available to transport them overseas . 8 . After articles of equipment leave the factory there is delay in transportation . The average daily run per car of freight is around 40 miles ? about twice the rate of good infantry marching . This rate , I believe , is high for peace time , but seems low under present conditions when transportation is supposed to be mobilized for war . Very respectfully , With regard to the armament of our troops sent abroad , it can be stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing for Europe by lack of a modern rifle , and that if any were sent over without sufficient training , it was for other reasons than the lack of rifles to train them with . We neither needed nor received any assistance from our Allies in rifle supply , and never at any time suffered from shortage of rifles in the theatre of war , nor from any threat of such shortage . It is a fact that we had on hand upon our entry into the war more than twice as many rifles , of the standard Springfield model , than were needed for all the troops which we had in the theatre of war a full year later . We had manufactured , up to the time of the armistice , 2,500,000 rifles of the two service models which , with the 600,000 which we had on hand at the beginning , were enough for an army of // 6,000,000 men , a million more than we were contemplating for the campaign of 1919 . No decision concerning the equipment of our armies for the great struggle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was arrived at in a conference presided over by the Secretary of War , at which there were present the Chief of Staff , the President of the War College , the Commandant of Marines , General Pershing , who had already been designated to command the expeditionary force , and myself , upon whom fell the task of presenting and urging the program . The event showed that there was no matter connected with the prosecution of the war in which our forces were more adequately served than in this most important one of all , and this without any offsetting price , except the evidence exhibited to the people of the previous neglect of proper provision , and the subsequent savage criticism by some of those who might have feared that they would be held responsible . VI MACHINE GUNS THE late war , so to speak , brought the machine gull into its own . This class of weapon had been developed to a serviceable stage at the time of the Spanish-American War , but neither in that war , nor in the Boer War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relief Expedition , nor in the RussoJapanese War , nor in the Balkan Wars had it attracted anything like the attention which has resulted from its use in the World War . In the matter of the delivery of musketry fire proving ground performance shows the machine gun to be equivalent to twenty or thirty infantrymen , and if its necessary crew be taken as , say , five men , it can be regarded as saving , in uses for which it is appropriate , from three-quarters to four-fifths of the men who would otherwise be necessary to do the same work . It has been employed universally in the defense of positions ; either those recently taken in an advance , and in process of " consolidation , " or those prepared and held against an expected assault . A prominent use , of the latter class , was by the Germans in rear guard actions , where machine guns scattered along the front , in " nests " or " pill-boxes , " that is , in specially concealed or 74 // specially strengthened emplacements , constituted mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get between . In many cases the crews were evidently instructed to fight to the last , with the expectation that they would then fall into the hands of the pursuers , while the main body would get away . The necessity for discouraging this practice undoubtedly led in some cases to refusal to accept the surrender of the crews . As was to be expected , the extensive employment of the weapons brought about a differentiation of func-tion , and the introduction of special designs for special uses . The normal design was used for posi-tion holding , where weight was not of importance in comparison with prolonged and continuous fire , while a lighter design was developed for carrying forward with an advancing line , and holding a posi-tion gained until it could be more strongly " consoli-dated . " This later type was called , for want of a better name , automatic rifle , leaving the name ma-chine gun for the heavier type , although both types are machine guns and both are automatic rifles . In the automatic rifle a certain degree of endurance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heavy Browning , weighing in the neighborhood of 36 pounds each , are examples of machine guns ; the Chauchat and the light Browning , weighing 16 to 19 pounds , are automatic rifles ; while the Lewis and the Benet-Mercie , or light Hotchkiss , of about 26 pounds weight , are intermediate and not favored for ground use by the French , although so employed by the British . The Germans had appal. - // ently realized better than anyone else the value of machine guns in the kind of fighting which they expected to be engaged in , and therefore supplied them to their troops in greater numbers than did the other Powers . We , in common with many other civilized nations , had before the World War such an appreciation of the need for machine guns as was expressed by our establishing an allowance of about four per regiment , with no machine gun organizations outside the regiments , and a supply was then accumulating at the very low rate corresponding to an annual appropriation of about $150,000 . The present allowance is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the above amount was made in the Army Act of 1912 , but before the consideration commenced of a bill for the next year , expressions of dissatisfaction with the rifle with which the service was then principally armed ? the BenetMercice , otherwise known as the light Hotchkiss ? had reached the ears of Congress . This dissatisfaction was , I believe , largely due to lack of proper instruction in the use of this class of weapon , and the belief upon the part of numbers of officers in the service that there was some other machine gun of such simple construction that no great amount of special instruction would be necessary for its use ? which was a radical error . No entirely satisfactory machine gun has yet been developed ; that is , we have never had a machine gun that is not subject to stoppage by reason of some kind of malfunction . The Browning gun , as // was anticipated by the Ordnance Department , is a great advance in this respect ; but it must be remembered that these weapons are machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Benet-Mercie giving out about one horsepower for each pound of its weight ? approximately double the output per pound of the Liberty engine ? they are , therefore , subject to the weaknesses and infirmities of all machines . They have never reached the simplicity and perfection of construction which would insure their operation in the hands of the soldier with the same certainty that attends that of the ordinary rifle or pistol . Their infirmities have been accepted because of the large effective output which can be had from them when they do work well . Our line officers now understand the intensive and laborious instruction which is necessary to train a soldier in the mechanical manipulation and the tactical use of a machine gun . The Benet-Mercie automatic machine rifle . was adopted for use in the United States Service in 1909 , after exhaustive trials by two boards , both of which reported that it was the best and most reliable machine gun which had ever been before the Government . It is still the machine gun of the British Government for the armament of tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the dissatisfaction above mentioned , instead of making an appropriation for machine guns , authorized the Secretary of War to contract for their manufacture to the extent of $150,000 , " if in his opinion it be for the interest of the service . " // This legislation reflected doubt in the mind of Congress as to a suitable service machine rifle , and threw upon the Secretary of War a more impressive burden than usual of responsibility for the type of machine rifle for which contracts might be made . Before urging upon the Secretary of War , therefore , the exercise of the authority which had , with some warning , been conferred upon him , the Ordnance Department joined in arrangements for a competitive test of automatic machine rifles , which was begun in the autumn of 1913 and continued in the spring of 1914 ; the guns now most prominent among those which were tested being the BenetMercici , the Vickers , and the Lewis , which last gun figured extensively in the expressions of dissatisfaction which became common at the lack of sufficient equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point being urged in behalf of this gun that there was prejudice against it in the Ordnance Department , and that the ( Government was , therefore , unwisely , if not Nvrongfully , deprived of a supply which everybody afterward would have been very glad to have . It is appropriate , therefore , to set forth especially the experience of the United States Government with the IA , N is gun . The first offer of the Lewis gun to the Government of which there is any record , or of which I have any personal knowledge , was made to the Board of Ordnance and Fortification in a letter dated May 2 , 1912 , from the Automatic Arms Company , which controls the patent , by the attorney for the company , Mr. R. M. Calfee ( proceedings of the // Board of Ordnance and Fortifications , dated May 2 , 1912 , signed by General Wood ) . The Board considered this letter on June 6th , and replied that it did not care to accept certain limitations upon the test which had been imposed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ordnance and Fortification , dated June 6 , 1912 ; signed by General Crozier ) . On July 2 , 1912 , the Board considered a letter , dated July 1st , from the Automatic Arms Company , requesting reconsideration of the Board 's action in regard to the test of the gun , and stated in its reply " the Automatic Arms Company is informed that , after careful consideration of their letter , the board is of the opinion that the usual procedure should be followed , namely , the gun must be submitted to the test prescribed by the Ordnance Department . During this test the representatives of the company will be permitted to be present , and , preliminary to the test , to give such exhibition of the performance of the gun as they may see fit , in the presence of the representative of the Ordnance Department charged with technical examination of the gun . After this demonstration is completed the gun will then be submitted to such tests as the Ordnance Department may deem necessary . Ammunition for such tests will be furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have the privilege of declining to subject it to any portion of the test which may be proposed to which they may not wish to have it subjected at the time , but in re80 ORDNANCE AND THE WORLD WAR specting their wishes in this regard the report will , of course , state the facts . " In the course of the complete test the gun will have the kind of field test which they desire , and copies of all reports in regard to the test will be furnished the company . " ( Proceedings of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification , dated July 2 , 1912 ; signed by General Wood . ) The matter rested at this stage until March 5 , 1913 , when the Automatic Arms Company again offered a Lewis machine gun for test , pursuant to which a test was ordered on the recommendation of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification . ( Proceedings of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification , dated March 6 , 1913 ; signed by General Wood . ) A board of officers was , pursuant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appointed by the War Department , to make a competitive test of all the automatic machine guns which should be submitted to it , the membership of the board consisting of Colonel I+7rnest Hinds , U. S. A. ; Major W. G. Penfield , Ordnance Department ; Captain W. R. Smedberg , Jr. , Cavalry ; Captain Frank S. Bowen , Infantry , and Lieutenant Austin N. Hardee , Infantry . The board met at the Springfield Armory in September , and tested seven different models of automatic machine guns . The Lewis gun submitted used American ammunition , but had been manufactured in England . At this test all of the competing guns were eliminated except the Benet-Mercie and the Vickers , and of these two a field test was made in // the spring of 1914 , which resulted in the selection of the Vickers gun . Of the three guns that were the most prominent , the report of the board states that in the endurance test there were with the Lewis gun 206 jams and malfunctions ; with the Vickers gun , 23 ; and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken parts , while there were none for the Vickers and 7 for the Benet-Mercie ; and the Lewis gun had 15 parts not broken but requiring replacement , as against none for the Vickers gun and none for the Benet-Mercie . The board reported that , " The Lewis automatic machine rifle , as at present designed , is not superior to the service automatic machine rifle ( Benet-Mercie ) on account of the failure to maintain continuous fire , the large number of parts which were broken , and the large number of jams , many of the latter being reduced only after much difficulty and considerable time . " The report also stated that " The board is of the opinion that , with the exception of the Vickers gun , none of the other guns submitted showed sufficiently marked superiority for the military service , in comparison with the service automatic machine rifle ( BenetMercie ) to warrant further consideration of them in a field test . " The instructions of the board had been to ascertain whether any gun had sufficient superiority over the Benet-Mercie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the test the Army bill of 1914 was passed , and as no conclusion had been reached , the bill made no appropriation for machine guns . At the time of the passage of the bill of the // following year , 1915 , the Vickers gun had been adopted as the approved type , and that bill therefore made an appropriation of $150,000 for machine rifles , and in addition reappropriated the unexpended balance of $44,421.00 , which had been left over from preceding appropriations at the time when the question of substituting a new machine rifle for the Benet-Mercie was taken up . Funds thus made available were used in making a contract for Vickers guns , which had been unanimously recommended by the testing board for adoption in replacement of the Benet-114ercie . It is apparent that at this stage , the middle of the year 1915 , there would have been no justification for expending the slender means at the disposal of the Department for procuring Lewis guns , in the face of the declaration of the board that they were inferior both to the Benet-Mercie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been recommended for adoption . No Lewis gun was presented for a second test , after the first one in 1913 , until April of 1916 . This was understandable in view of the outbreak of the war in Europe , where the guns were being made , but in the latter part of 1915 . their manufacture in this country for the forces of the British Empire was commenced by the Savage Arms Company of Utica , N. Y. , and the Ordnance Department then took the initiative in an effort to secure a second gun for test . In reply to request on the Savage Arms Company for such a gun , its Vice-President , // Mr. W. G. Greene , wrote on September 30 , 1915 , as follows : " At the present time we are not able to furnish your Department with a gun , having only two ourselves , both of which are in constant use at the factory , one as a manufacturing model , and the other as an experimental model . These two guns were both manufactured by the Birmingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guns if you care to send an officer . " ( 0.0. file 472.5/55 . ) Under date of December 28 , 1915 , after another inquiry , Mr. Greene wrote : " We acknowledge your letter of the 23d , in which you ask if we can furnish you with one SavageLewis machine gun . We are , of course , most anxious to furnish the Department not only with one Savage-Lewis gun , but with a considerable quantity , but at the present moment our output is all engaged , deliveries just now being due the Department of Militia and Defense at Ottawa , and we do not feel at liberty to divert even one gun from the contract deliveries . " ( 0.0. file 472.5/55 . ) In response to another effort of the Department , 11Tr . A. A. Boric , president of the Savage Arms Company , wrote under date of January 27 , 1916 : " I regret to inform you that such a sale at the present time is impossible on account of other commitments made by this company . We trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver a Lewis machine gun to the Department for the purpose of test by the Department , and will notify you in re84 ORDNANCE AND THE WORLD WAR gard to this as soon as possible . " ( 0 . 0 . file 472.5/74 . ) A test of the Lewis gun was finally held at the Springfield Armory in April of 1916 . Two guns were tested , one using American and the other English ammunition . In regard to the gun using American , or service ammunition , the report of the board states : " The service gun was withdrawn at this time by the Savage Arms Company ( Mr. Borie and Mr. Wright , Colonel Dooley , Mr. Nelson and Mr. Renew being present ) , who stated that , as the gun was in an experimental stage , and as it was giving trouble both in feeding and in rupturing cartridges , which trouble it was thought would be overcome in a subsequent gun , they considered it useless to continue the test . " ( 0 . O. file 472.5/110 . ) This statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for American ammunition was in an experimental stage at that time ought to dispose of the claim that it was then , or had been at any time previously , ready for purchase for the use of the American Army . Tlie claim as to its ability to fire American ammunition was made by Col. Lewis in his testimony before the Senate Military Committee , on December 22 , 1917 , in the following language : " Not only does the Lewis gun fire ammunition , American ammunition , successfully , but the Chief of Ordnance fired it many times himself in the tests in the presence of the members of the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications . That was in 1912 . There has been no question about firing // American anmiunition . It was made to fire it . It fires it better than any other kind of ammunition . I have now perfected it so that it will fire eight different kinds of ammunition of as many different countries . " I want , therefore , first of all to settle the question of whether it will use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before your committee and deliberately misrepresented the facts in the case . It is done intentionally . I can not escape the conclusion that the misrepresentation is intentional , because it is so oft repeated . " ( Hearings : Part 2 ; page 701 . ) The board was composed of Captain W. R. Smedberg , Jr. , of the Cavalry ; Captain G. II . Stewart , of the Ordnance Department , and First Lieutenant Thomas W. Brown , of the Infantry . The board was created by a War Department Order , and submitted its report to the Adjutant-General . It was not a hoard of the Ordnance Department , nor were any o I ' the boards which dealt with the Lewis gun . They were all War Department boards , which contained only one Ordnance officer , and were not subject to the jurisdiction of the Chief of Ordnance . In regard to the gun using British ammunition , the Board reported as follows : " Considering the performance of the Lewis gun in the test reported herein , and comparing that performance with the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1915 ) and of the Springfield gun ( Automatic Machine Rifle , caliber. // .30 , model of 1919 ) * in the test conducted by the board convened by Special Orders No. 191 , War Department , August 16 , 1913 , the board finds that the Lewis gun in its present state of development is not equal or eaper.i.or to either of the above-men tioned guns . The Lewis gun is not as reliable or as dependable as are the other guns mentioned . The following table siio ws in summary the data upon which this opinion is based : " Tile Lewis gun , on the other hand , is lighter , sim pler and has fewer number of parts than the other guns mentioned ; and , in the opinion of the board , the question as to whether or not it can be developed to a satisfactory degree of reliability and depend-ability is an open one . " The board finds , therefore , that the results of the present test were not such as to justify the purchase of four Lewis guns chambered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in view of the desirable features of the gun , the board recom mends that if the Savage Arms Company under ' Otherwise known as the Benet-Mercie. it // take to develop a gun for the service ammunition a ! ' further test be made , upon their request , after the development shall have been carried to a satisfactory stage . " ( 0.0. file 472.5/110 . ) I t is thus seen that at this second test the board , 1:ited that the Lewis gun , even using British am'Intuition , was not as good as had been shown at the test , of 1913 to be both the Benet-Mercie , which had hem superseded , and the Vickers , which had been ndopted ; and that the gun using American ammunition had not been able to get through the test at all . ' I'h , ' re would , therefore , have been no justification l , 1 this time for the investment of funds in Lewis guns , with two better types within the knowledge of t h , Department , even if there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer of the same year , 1916 , when , pursuant to my recommendation , 353 of these guns were purchased , for use on the Mexican border , from the Savage Arms Company , where they happened to be available from a number which had been made I'or the Canadian Government . The guns used British ammunition , a supply of which had to be purchased for them , and were the only machine guns V hieh could be had . As funds were not available for the purchase of these guns , a deficit had to he created for the purpose ; that is , they were purchased without authority of law . Unusual care was taken in establishing schools and furnishing experts to give instruction in the use of the guns before the soldiers were allowed to have them . Various reports were received as to their performance . The following is from an officer who was an instructor in one of the schools . It inclosed a letter which had been written to the editor of the Army and Navy Journal , of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This inclosure I also present : // CAMP COTTON , El Paso , Texas , December 11 , 1916 . GENERAL WILLIAM CROZIER , Chief of Ordnance , U. S. A. , Washington , D. C. My Dear General : From the privilege extended me while you were observing the machine gun instruction at Fort Bliss , Texas , some time since , I am addressing you in regard to the selection of the types of machine guns to be adopted and secured for our service . The enclosed letter is written not in the nature of an expression of which type of . automatic rifle is the better , only as the result of the comparison of the t wo as we have found them in our daily work . This letter was addressed to the Army and Navy Journal requesting that it be published with no desire to get ourselves before the public , but solely t I rough interest in this very important subject and with the hope that it may enlighten some who have not had the opportunity to witness such a comparison and test in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article published or used in any way that you may deem advisable and best , or advise us , as we will not forward a copy to t lie Army and Navy Journal until advised by you . We are intensely interested in the subject of oiachine guns and only wish that we had a chance to learn more of and work more with the various types i ' automatic rifles and machine guns , than can be had in our very interesting work here . With kindest personal regards , Very truly yours , T. N. GIMPERLING , Captain 34th Infantry . // EL PASO , TEXAS , December 9 , 1916 . Note : Not sent ( Dec. 18 , 1916 ) . To the Editor of the Army and Navy Journal , New York , N. Y. Sir : In view of the present controversy over the selection of automatic machine rifle to be adopted and bought for the army ; as the machine gun board is now in session and as various articles are appearing in your columns on this subject , we request that you publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months of daily instruction in the handling and firing of these guns and in problems simulating active service conditions and requirements as nearly as can be obtained anywhere . Tlie two types of automatic machine rifles used were the lienet-Mercie and the Lewis gun . Factory experts oP e wli type were present to keep their guns in the best possible condition . I'lie micliiue gun company of the 33rd Michigan Inhmtry , 95 per cent of whose personnel are general mechanicat engineers and expert mechanics , is equipped with both the Benet-Mercie and the Lewis automatic rifles ; this company had two Benet and four Lewis guns . The organization has received thorough instruction in the operation - of both types of guns from experts direct from the Savage Arms Company ( Lewis gun ) and from the Springfield Armory ( Bonet-Mercie gun ) and there is no reason to believe other than that these men are fully competent to assist in giving both types of gun a fair and impartial test . We therefore believe we are safe in asserting , as both guns were in use side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two types of guns , as efficient weapons , could be fairly judged . This company has fired approximately forty thousand rounds of service ammunition with the Benet guns and approximately twenty-five thousand rounds of British .303 with the Lewis guns . These two Benet-Mercie guns have been in use for a period of about six years and have been in use at the School of Instruction at Sparta , Wisconsin . During this time they were in use by the machine gun companies of the Michigan National Guard for a period of three years ; while the Lewis guns were issued to them in August of this year and were , therefore , new , as they were part of the Canadian shipment taken over by the U. S. Government from the Savage Arms ComPany . In every case in which these guns have been fired side by side , the Benet-Mercie gun has proven its superiority . Many examples could be cited in support of this , one of which is as follows : " Firing was maintained for one and one-half minutes for all six guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one jam ; another fired 364 rounds with two jams . One Lewis gun tired 117 rounds with four jams ; a second fired 87 shots with two jams ; a third fired 44 rounds with five jams ; and a fourth fired 9 rounds with one jam , which put this gun out of action . " This is but a fair example of the general results obtained by this company in the operation of the two types of gun . The company has obtained as many as 546 rounds from one Benet gun in continuous firing without a. , jam . With the Lewis gun the best that they have // obtained is the 11.7 rounds with two jams in one and one-half minutes , cited above . It is our opinion that the parts of the Lewis gun are not properly finished and that they are made of a rather poor grade of material . The gun has a number of steel stamped parts , improperly heat-treated , which cause jams and a consequent inefficiency in the gun . As an example , the magazine is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a combination of soft aluminum core and metal strips which are riveted on . This causes the magazine to be very vibrant and susceptible to the strain of feed pawl. functioning . The ejector is made of a thin steel stamping , improperly heat-treated , and very ( . Jteii it bends , nearly always batters on the end , through bolt action , in the course of eighty to one lrtnidred and fifty rounds . The feed pawls , stop lla.wls ( ( and r0bound pawls seem to be made of a poor grade of steel . The gas cylinder is made of a twenty gauge mill . run steel , which has been found to be full of scale pits and imperfections . We believe that the gun , as at present constructed , could be made ill lots oL ' a. thousand or more , at approximately fifty or iil'ty-five dollars per gun , for material and labor . It is now sold to the Government for a thousand dollars . From the standpoint of mechanics , the BenetMercie gun is a masterpiece , inasmuch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material and are properly treated where this is essential . The price at which the Government issues this gun is approximately $412.00 , which , it is believed , would net , to a private manufacturing concern , but a fair profit over the cost of production . // We are wedded to no type of gun , but are presenting these facts in the interest of the service .

Chief Engr . Chevrolet Motor Car Co . The School of Musketry submitted a report , January 7 , 1917 ( 0.0. 472.5112/129 ) , on efficiency of machine guns , showing extensive firings and careful consideration . The report stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firing . The guns were new . Except for some possible test firing not a shot had been fired from any of them prior to their use by this class . When they were received at the school it was found that several of the parts did not fit properly . This was true in particular of the joints between the barrel groups and the receiver groups . The other cases of misfit were due largely to poor workmanship and lack of finish . " When the firing of the guns began there was very little trouble with them that could not be accounted // for by the fact that the personnel of the class was inexperienced and that about 3 per cent of the am-munition used was found to be faulty . After about 2,000 rounds had been fired from each gun , jams began to occur which were due to causes other than untrained personnel and defective ammunition . " By far the greater portion of jams due to defec-tive mechanism were caused by the wear of the feed operating arms and stud , the bending of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazines ; and o1 ' these about one-half were due to faulty magazines . " The total niiniber of rounds fired from these 13 guns was 166,180 . The maximum number fired from any one gnri durli ) g any particular day was 2,992 . " Thc 1'ollowlii , - list shows the parts of these guns that were broken , damaged or lost during the course of the firing above noted : " In their present con ( lition these buns can not fie depended ilpon to fire , a sir ) le magazine without malfunctions . W ctiter or not they would operate with good magazines and with serviceable feed operating arms and studs remains to be seen when they are tested in this mariner . At the present writing the spare parts with which to make such tests are not on hand . // " The Lewis gun in its present state of development is not believed to be a satisfactory weapon for issue to our service as an automatic rifle or - first line gun . ' " The Levis gun , while it is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities . Its lightness , the simplicity of its mechanism , the efficiency of its cooling system , and the ease with which men learn to use it ( when it is new and working well ) , all tend to indicate that if it can be made dependable , it will be an excellent first line gun . " This report was signed by Colonel R. M. Blatchford , Infantry , afterward a major-general in the National Army . A number of reports were submitted by organization commanders in the Southern Department in regard to these guns , of which the general purport is exhibited in the following letter from the Department Commander . : SOUTHERN DEPARTMENT , Port Sam Houston. , Texas , March 1 , 1917 . Prom : Commanding General , Southern . Department . To : The Adjutant General of the Army . Subject : Reports covering tests made of the Lewis machine gun and Benet-Mercie machine g1171. 1 . Herewith are the reports of the commanding officers of the machine gun companies of the 19th Infantry and the 37th Infantry covering compara96 ORDNANCE AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Beret-Mercie machine gun . 2 . These reports are forwarded in connection with the 9th indorsement on A.G.O . file 2436783. 3 . These reports are further evidence that in the extensive tests made in the Southern Department , the Lewis machine gun has failed to demonstrate its superiority over the Benet-Mercie gun in so far as its suitability for use with the machine gun organization of infantry and cavalry regiments is concerned . ( signed ) JOHN J. PERSHING , Major General , Commanding . In the meantime , in July , 1916 , the same War Department board which had tested the Lewis gun in April tested a Colt gun submitted by the Colt Patent fire 1rins Manufacturing Company , and reported as 1'olloNN-s : " Considering the performance of the Colt gun in this test as compared with the performance of the Lewis gurr cfiamhered 1'or British Mark VII ammunition , relwrted on by this board under date of April 25 , 19161 the board finds that the Colt gun as subinitted is superior to the Lewis gun for general service use . The Colt gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board finds , however , that 1'or the particular case of use in aeroplanes , the Lighter Lewis gun , with its self-contained magazine , is superior to the Colt gun , in spite of the former 's greater liability to malfunction . " During all this time appropriations for the purchase of machine guns had been most meager , but the Army Appropriation Act approved August 29 , 1916 , carried a large appropriation of $12,000,000 , // for these guns , and its judicious expenditure became a. matter of great moment . This - %i- as the first appropriation of size sufficient to be of any significance in procuring a supply of machine guns which was ever made . About ten days Before the date of the Appropriation Act , and when it was evident that the inclusion , upon its passage , of the sum for machine guns was assured , I submitted to the Secretary of War a recommendation as to the disposition which should be made of the funds . The recommendation was made in the light of a possible emergency calling for a hasty supply of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in reply to a recommendation which had come from General Wood that the Benet-Mercie guns in the service be discarded and replaced by Lewis guns . My recommendation is contained in the following memorandum : WAR DEPARTMENT , Office of the Chief of Ordnance , Washington , August 18 , 1916 . Memorandum for the Secretary of War . Subject : Purchase of machine guns . 1 . I recommend that the following action be taken upon the passage of the pending Army appropriation bill : ( a ) That for emergency requirements in the immediate future either Colt guns or Lewis guns , using American ammunition , be purchased . With this authorization I shall probably purchase Colt guns , in accordance with the recommendations of the testing board as to their superiority over the Lewis guns for general service , unless a particularly favorable reply shall be received to an inquiry now // pending as to possible terms of purchase of Lewis guns . That orders be immediately placed for Vick ers guns , to the extent of one-half of the funds available . That orders for machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of ordering , to the extent of the remaining funds available be placed not later than November 1st next . That a test for the determination of its suit-ability for purchase and use in the service be made of any gun presented in sufficient time for the conclusion and consideration of the test before November 1st next . That thereafter the usual practice be followed of testing any nrac , hine gun which may be presented for test , with reference to its suitability for purchase for use in the service from any sums made available by future approp ) riatioils . Tliat decision be definitely made not to replace the Benet-N l erci6 - tins now in the service with Lewis guns , or AN ' th hose of any other type , unless further developments slmll indicate the desirability of a review of this de ( , ision . That arnrouucernent of the above be made in such manner as to reach all interested parties . 2 . These reconnnerndations are made in the light of the following infoni ) ation : The total number of automatic machine guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12,000 , of which the fol lowing are on hand or under manufacture : // Of these the Maxims and the Vickers are of a heavy type , and the Benet-Mereie and the Lewis are of a light type . Some guns on hand , of older models , are not counted . The funds expected to be available are about $12,000,000 , which are sufficient to purchase about 4,000 guns , with necessary accessories , of the most expensive type . Additional funds ought to be available not later than March 4th next , to be appropriated at the next session of Congress . 3 . Before the next session of Congress the Ordnance Department will bring to the attention of the War Department the necessity for arriving at a conclusion as to whether a heavy and a light type of automatic machine gun are needed in the service , and if so , their relative numbers . Such a conclusion is not necessary with reference to the program above recommended , for the reason that the program will leave the supply such as to render compliance possible with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigadier General , Chief of Ordnance , United States Army . The tests referred to under ( d ) and ( e ) of the memorandum were designed to afford opportunity for a perfected Lewis gun , a Browning gun , or any other , to establish its suitability for procurement . The Secretary of War did not follow my recommendations , but , on September 28 , 1916 , appointed a board with the following instructions : " The board will consider and make recommendations as to whether a single type or more than one type of machine rifle , using small arms ammunition , is needed for the service , and the type or types which // should be procured ; and if more than one type , the proportion of the different types . " In making its recommendations the board will take into consideration the present supply of machine rifles of the various types ; all reports of tests of machine rifles which may be believed to be serviceable in reaching a conclusion ; the amount of funds now available for the procurement of machine rifles ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supply at an appropriate rate ; and any records of the War Department , or of any branch of it , which it may desire to consult . If the board shall find that tests previously made are insufficient to enable it to reach a conclusion it will make recommendation as to further tests which ought to be made , their character , time and place . " The board will recommend the type of gun which should be procured in case of an emergency requiring an earlier supply in possibly limited quantity than can be had of the gun which it may consider as eventually the most suitable , if there be any of which earlier delivery may be possible ; and whether contract should be entered into for a considerable supply of a gun of known type in advance of any test which it may conclude to be called for , and if so , to what extent . " The board will submit its report to the Adjutant General of the Army . " The membership of the board was selected with great care , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : Brigadier General Francis H. French , Colonel Joseph T. Dickman , 2d // Cavalry ; Colonel Tracy C. Dickson , U. S. Army , retired ; Lieutenant Colonel Henry D. Todd , Jr. , Coast Artillery Corps ; Captain Robert H. Willis , Jr. , Signal Corps ; Lieutenant Steven C. Rowan , U. S. Navy ; Captain Edward B. Cole , U. S. Marine Corps ; Mr. Bascom Little , Cleveland , Ohio , and Mr. B. M. Hanson , Hartford , Conn . Their instructions re-quired them in effect to cover the whole subject of the supply of machine guns , including types . Mr. Hanson , an expert mechanical engineer , had at that time no connection with any machine gun interest , although he subsequently became a member of the staff of the Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company . On October 24 , 1916 , the board submitted a pre-liminary report in which it recommended among other things " That tests heretofore made show that the Vick-ers machine rifle fulfills to a high degree the requirements of the military service for a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other information ob-tained by the board do not warrant its recommend-ing at this time a rifle of the light type . " That available funds be used for immediate pro-curement of 4,600 Vickers machine rifles and 960 pack outfits for the same . " That further and competitive tests of machine rifles be conducted by the board at the Springfield Armory , Springfield , Mass. , tests to begin May 1 , 1917 . " This report was approved by the Secretary of // War on October 27 , 1916 , but immediate action of the Ordnance Department in regard to procuring 4,600 Vickers machine guns was suspended by the War Department upon a protest by Mr. R. M. Calfee , of the Automatic Arms Company , representing the Lewis gun ; and the machine gun board was reconvened . It submitted an additional report dated December 4 , 1916 , which confirmed its previous recommendations , with a statement that if it was desired to retain a certain amount of the funds then on hand for the purpose of insuring procurement of light machine guns after a test in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of guns which had been allowed for wastage . The final conclusion reached by the War Department ( contained in O. O. file 472.5-112/117 ) was that 4,000 Vickers machine gulls with 960 pack outfits therefor , should he innnediately procured ; that $1,560,000 should he held in reserve for the purchase of guns of such other types than the Vickers as the Secretary of War might decide upon after test , or for such other use as might be decided by the Secretary . The Adjutant General 's Office on December 15 , 1916 , transmitted to the Ordnance Office final authority to proceed with the procurement of Vickers guns . On the following day , December 16th , the order was placed and the contract executed and signed ( A. G. O. file 2482640-E ) . The resort to a board delayed action until about the middle of December , or nearly four months , but the method used was through extreme solicitude to give every consideraMACHINE // tion to the Lewis gun , and prevent any reasonable ground for dissatisfaction at its treatment . Such was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany became apparent . All of the funds at the disposal of the Ordnance Department , except about $1,500,000 , had , by authority of the War Department , been utilized in placing a contract for machine guns of the type which had repeatedly been declared , by the most expert agencies which the War Department could create , to be the best in existence , and which had received emphatic and continuing indorsement in the European War . The remaining funds had been held for utilization in accordance with knowledge which might subsequently be acquired . If , up to this time , any considerable order had been placed for Lewis guns using American ammunition , the action would have been taken in the face of the failure of these guns ever to perform satisfactorily at a test with American ammunition ; and against the recommendation of every body of advisers upon which the War Department had called for counsel . In view of the fact that Lewis guns were at this time rendering such service to the British forces as to justify their continuance as the standard machine gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises as to why good Lewis guns were being made in England , and at the same time poor I , ewis guns were being made in this country and urged upon the Government with great insistence . I do not undertake to answer this question , but it must be remembered that no Lewis gun as made in // England for the British service had ever been available for the United States , even for test . On April 9 , 1917 , immediately after the outbreak of the war , I recommended that , as soon as funds should become available , which was expected to be almost immediately , orders should be given for 4,000 more Vickers guns , and for 2,500 Colt guns . The latter were recommended because it was practicable to secure them promptly , and , although not of an adopted type , their immediate availability called for their purchase as an additional number to those covered by the machine gun program . The Lewis gun had , through the winter and early spring , in the meantime been brought to a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test held under the auspices of the Navy Department , and witnessed by one of my officers , over fifteen important changes having been made in it ; and , therefore , at the same time , and in anticipation of the test to be held in the month of May , I recommended that the $1,500,000 at the disposal of the Department be invested in an order for Lewis guns , and that further authority to procure up to 5,000 of these guns be given , for utilization as soon as additional funds should become available . The funds thus already available were utilized in placing an order for 1,300 Lewis guns , which was done on April 12th . The 2,500 Colt guns were ordered on June 2d , using funds which were made available by the Army Appropriation Act of May 12 , 1917 . From the funds appropriated in the same Act , the Ordnance Department also ordered , on June 12th , // 4,400 Lewis guns , at the same time informing the Savage Arms Company that additional orders might be expected . Two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage of the first war appropriation measure , the appropriation Act of May 12th having been small , this act being the deferred Army appropriation bill which failed at the session before . At the tests which were held in the month of May by the War Department machine gun board , in ac-cordance with its program , the Lewis gun 's per-formance was highly satisfactory . In regard to it the board stated : " The mechanism of this gun has been under con-tinual development since it was last tested by the War Department . . . . The Lewis machine rifle , caliber .30 , fully established its character as a first-class machine gun . Many improvements have been made in this gun since it was last tested , which justify the delay of the War Department in accord-ing complete recognition to this weapon . " Following this report orders for Lewis guns were given from time to time as funds became available , up to the number of about 42,000 , ordered by the autumn of 1917 , and subsequently increased to 86,700 , to produce which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2,000 per month , and afterwards to 3,750 per month , the arrangement providing for an expenditure of $1 , - 000,000 in the expansion of facilities , to be taken care of properly in the price of the guns . This history shows that as soon as the Lewis gun // was developed to the point of ability to properly perform with American ammunition , large orders were given for it , and the manufacturers were encouraged to expand their plants , the commencement of this action anticipating the report of the War Department board . In the meantime , while the consideration of the relative merits of the Benet-Mercie , Vickers and Lewis guns was going on , Mr. John Browning , of Utah , working in connection with the Colt Patent Fire Arms Co. , of alartford , Conn. , had undertaken the design of a machine gun , and had informed the Ordnance Department of his efforts . One or two exhibitions of the gun had been made , which showed promising performance of both a light and heavy t1pe , a el just ilied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense conclusive or properly to be regarded as tests , and had not been made as such . A heavy gun , water-cooled , and a light gun , air-cooled , were finally completed and presented to the hoard for the tests held in the month of May , 1917 . In regard to them the report of the board stated as follows : " .. The board invites special attention to the tactical possibilities of the Colt automatic machine rifle , air-cooled , highly portable , designated above as ? the Browning air-cooled gun . According to reports received from observers , especially by Major L. T. Hillman , Ordnance Department , the drift of the French Army is decidedly towards greater use of automatic rifles of highly portable type , such as the Chauchat . In the British Army the Lewis gun // is used in much the same way , but , on account of its weight and size , not with equal facility . " The report of the machine gun board further stated in reference to the other Browning , the watercooled gun : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing of over 20,000 shots , that a further test of 20,000 shots was fired by the same gun for endurance . . . . The only break was one sear after 39,500 shots ; this caused the only stoppage directly chargeable to the gun . " The report of the board of May , 1917 , upon its receipt by the War Department , was sent to the War College Division , General Staff , and eventually reached the Ordnance Department on June 24 , 1917 , with instructions , among others , that as soon as possible Browning light air-cooled automatic rifles be furnished to infantry at the rate of at least eight per company . The program of procurement of machine guns and automatic rifles was based upon these instructions , upon considerations concerning the training of troops in the United States , and upon information from abroad as to the possibility of obtaining from the French Government an emergency supply of these weapons for the troops of the American Expeditionary Force first sent over , as well as on the plans for the armament of the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was contained in a cablegram received from General Pershing on July 17 , 1917 , an extract from which follows : .. Suggest United States make every attempt // to secure greatest possible production Vickers type per month . At least two Vickers guns on every aeroplane synchronized with engines and equal number Lewis guns unsynchronized with engine . We should anticipate use three Vickers synchronized guns and three Lewis unsynchronized on every aeroplane . Pershing . " The use to which it was intended to put the Lewis guns in the American force in Europe was important in that it would govern the details of construction of the guns . For aeroplane service the cooling apparatus would be left off as unnecessary . Therefore , in order to avoid cross purposes between the Ordnance Department and the Expeditionary Force as to the use of these guns , and to ascertain the possibility of supply of others by the French , the Chief of Ordnance , on July 28th , caused the following cablegram to be sent to General Pershing : " PEnS1IING Amexforce , Paris .

With reference to paragraph 4 your 67 , and in connection with paragraph 1 my 61 , arrangements completed to equip first two divisions with Hotchkiss machine guns and Chauchat automatic rifles . Subsequent divisions should be equipped in same manner until Vickers machine guns and a successful automatic rifle is furnished by Ordnance Department . Information desired as to when incoming divisions may be expected to arrive with machine guns and automatic rifles so furnished , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Government . Lewis machine gun more suitable as automatic rifle , but recommended as armament for aeroplanes in paragraph 9 my 44 , July 16th . Recommended Lewis machine guns be used for aeroplanes accordingly . ( Signed ) PERSHING . " The large number of Lewis guns which were ordered had been intended for use either in aeroplanes , or , in advance of securing a supply of light Browning guns , on the ground ; but the ability to secure from France machine guns of both light and heavy type sufficient for the armament of our forces until such time as light and heavy Browning or Vickers guns could be manufactured in this country , together with the appearance of the insistent demand for Lewis guns for the aviation service , // dictated instructions to the Savage Arms Company to manufacture all guns still under order from them of the aviation type , except 2,500 for use in the instruction of troops in this country . The event showed these instructions to embody a wise policy , which was adhered to till the end , notwithstanding severe criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis guns on the ground . The development of the use for Lewis guns in the aviation service , in addition to the Vickers guns , called for the continuous manufacture of the Lewis guns , instead of for the ultimate cessation of this manufacture , which had been contemplated for the time when a sufficient supply of light guns and heavy guns for the land service should make the use of an intermediate gun no longer necessary . About 180,0U0 machine guns and automatic rifles of the Vickers , Lewis , Colt-Marlin and Browning types were manufactured between the time of our entry into the war and the date of the armistice . This irrunber was greater than the total number manufactured by the British during the same period , and somewhat less than the number manufactured by the French . With the providential assistance of the French in preventnig an early shortage due to our poor initial supply , our rate of manufacture soon reached a point such as to remove all fear that our troops might lack a sufficient number of weapons of this class . Our rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , which was twice that of the French or the English , and the quality of the Browning guns proved in service to be such MACHINE GUNS 11l that both the British and the French Governments applied for the purchase of a supply for the armament of their own forces . The only possible way in which the resources of the department could have been utilized to secure a greater supply of these guns at an earlier date would have been to use a larger proportion of the $12,000,000 appropriated in the Act of August 29 , 191.6 , for the purchase of Colt guns , instead of putting the money mostly into Vickers guns , universally acknowledged to be a better type , but of which the delivery was slower than was promised and anticipated ; which was the experience both of the United States and England . To meet the demands . of the aviation service 23,000 Colt-Marlin aircraft guns , in addition to Lewis and Vickers guns were manufactured . The Colt-Marlin , a modification of the Colt , had developed a fortunate adaptability for airplane use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible use was made of the funds available and the manufacturing facilities of this country and the allies , in providing the best available types of machine guns . As in the case of field-artillery , there was no way in which the long national neglect to provide a proper supply of these weapons could be immediately made good from our own resources , upon the outbreak of the war ; but the full supply of our fighting troops with their needs , without failure in any instance , justifies the claim that the opportunity afforded by good luck was seized upon by good management . // The charge that government departments are inhospitable to inventors ; that a cold reception is often followed by rejection of the device offered ; and that it is only after the discouraged inventor has taken his device abroad and developed its merits with foreign help that the United States has recognized it , and has taken advantage of what it might have originally had with much less delay and expense , is heard with what ought to be disturbing frequency . The accusation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both houses of Congress , from the floor , and has been given wide publicity in the press , so that the public has been educated to believe it . The War Department , and within it the Ordnance Department as being the one most closely concerned with the field of mechanical invention , has been particularly subject ; to this charge , of which the general acceptance affords evidence of the popular tendency to regard the government official as a person of wooden-headed prejudice , prone to disregard suggestion from outside his own class . The tendency is so coiniuon that it must have some operating , though obscure , cause . The reasoning that there are nineteen useless inventions for one good one ; that the disappointed are vocal while the successful are quiet ; that an accusation is news while a defense is not , and the failure of response to the challenge to cite an instance within the last half century in which a device rejected by the War Department has afterward been shown to be useful ? though many have been subsequently tested by // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected , as has the long list of inventions by others than officers which have been adopted and put in use by the War Department . Possibly the experience of some inventors like Hotchkiss and Maxim , who have not themselves complained but have taken their plans abroad for development in the more lucrative markets of Europe instead of trying to bring them out under the meager appropriations for military purposes in the United States , has not been understood here in their own country , and has been taken as evidence that they went abroad because they were not appreciated by their government . In such cases the development was usually made by foreign private capital , stimulated by the prospect of good sales which was absent in the United States . In the case of the Lewis gun the charge of prejudice and unfair treatment was made by Col. Isaac N. Lewis , an officer of the army , on the active list at the time when his gun was first presented to the War Department , and subsequently retired . His status as an army officer justifies an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ordnance Department . The country is entitled to know whether an important department of the Government is so conducted that persons with valuable suggestions to offer , along the lines which the department is specially created to consider , can not expect even fair treatment at its hands . Col. Lewis ' charges have been made in correspondence and in the press , but they were made // with the most formality in his testimony before the Military Committee of the Senate on December 22 , 1917 . This testimony is found on pages 699 to 742 of the " Hearings before the Committee , on Military Affairs , United States Senate , 65th Congress , 2nd Session ; Part 2 " in the " Investigation of the War Department . " The parts relating to the alleged inability of Col. Lewis to secure consideration of his gun with reference to its test and adoption are as follows : " The Chairman . I think , Col. Lewis , you probably have in your mind some chronological order in which you wish to make your statement to the committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Senator Wadsworth . There is no necessity for going back prior to the completion of the first model of the Lewis machine gun and its offer to the Government , as .1 understand an offer was made . Col. Lewis . I would prefer , Senator , not to go into ancient history . The story , as I have intimated , is not a pleasant ; one , because I do not think it is a credit to the present organization of the Ordnance Bureau . Before , however , I begin that story , I would like for once and all to settle the question as to whether Lewis has given his machine gun to the Government or tried to give it to the Government or not . It has been denied officially and unofficially so many times . As early as 1911 , when the first model of the Lewis gun was built , I took it myself to Washington . // I presented it in person to the Chief of Staff . I requested him to examine it . It had been developed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd time . I was then on important duty . I was senior director of the Artillery School at Fort Monroe . I wanted to submit the gun unreservedly for the use of my Government , giving up all rights of whatever nature in the invention . In doing so I asked that it be presented to the Bureau of Ordnance and to the members of the Bureau of Ordnance and Fortifications as early as 1912 . ( Page 700 . ) The Chairman . On what terms did you offer to let the Government have the gun ? Col. Lewis . On one condition , and I think in view of what I had gone through , I was justified in that . It was only on the condition that the official test would not be made at the Springfield Armory . Senator Hitchcock . You mean that there was no royalty to be allowed ? Col. Lewis . So far as my interest was concerned . This gun , Senator , you will understand , has been developed under very discouraging circumstances . I was not a wealthy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chairman . What other interests were involved besides yourself ? Col. Lewis , The present stockholders , the owners of the Automatic Arms Company . They gave the capital to develop my gun when I was not able to do it . // The Chairman . Had they made offers as to what they would charge ? Col. Lewis . They did not get that far . The offer was not considered . The gun was not accepted for further test . It was not considered . It was turned down flat . ( Page 702 . ) Col. Lewis . I retired from active service five years ago , discouraged and disappointed . I went to Europe and expected to live in Europe . I played a lone hand in Europe . I did not have any friends . I had very little money back of me . A little group of Belgian bankers had bought the rights of the Lewis gun for Europe . The man at the head of that group closed a deal by which he purchased the European rights after seeing a single gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What year was that ? Col. Lewis . That was the fall of 1912 . I think it was in November , 1912 . I would like to state at this time what occurred in Washington in August of 1912 , a month or two before that . I left here in January , 1913 . I did not go to Europe until I had given up all hope of having any chance to develop the Lewis gun in America . I had four guns made without expense to the Government of the United States . They were good guns . They fired American ammunition . They were ready for any test . As the events afterwards developed , they were successful enough to be adopted in the countries of Europe . Two of those guns were offered to the United States Signal // Corps free and without any question of price . They were offered for test during the time of the maneuvers in Connecticut in that year . General Allen was then the Chief Signal Officer . I was called up by a long-distance telephone in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two guns for use during the maneuvers . I told them that I would be glad to do it . I would be glad to furnish even the pilot , as my son had offered his services , if he could be of any service , in shooting the gun from an aeroplane . The Lewis gun was the first one so used . It was fired out here at College Park , near Washington . That was the first shot ever fired from an aeroplane . I came on to Washington . I supposed they would expect me over here . In that connection , I would like to read a letter from the Acting Chief Signal Officer to me a few days later . It was one of the factors that decided me in going to Europe . This letter is dated " Office of the Chief Signal Officer , August 12 , 1912 . " It is addressed to " My dear Col. Lewis , " and reads as follows ( reading ) : August 2 , 1912 . MY DEAR COL . LEWIS : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ago endeavoring to straighten out the matter of the use of your gun during the maneuvers and have seen Gen. Wood and Gen. Crozier on the subject . The latter has entered what amounts to a protest against the use of the gun during the maneuvers by the Signal Corps of the Army . Of course , these maneuvers are official , and it is // presumed that this protest must be considered as final . The ordnance gun will be tried . I regret that your gun can not be officially tested and used . General Wood , in an official paper written by me after I had my personal conversation with him , of which I wrote you , has put the following indorsement , as I am told , though the paper has not yet come into this office : " The whole matter of the test of this gun is now under consideration . " Until the matter is settled , it is not believed any official action should be taken . " This bars the use of the gun at the maneuvers , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the gun with the militia or not during actual maneuvers or at College Park will probably not be objectionable . Very truly yours , GEORGE P. SCRIVEN . The protest that is referred to in that letter took the shape of a declination on the part of Gen. Crozier to furnish American ammunition to fire in the gun . When it was put in that shape , I refused to purchase the ammunition . I thought that if I furnished the gun and the aviator they might furnish the ammunition . I ask you , gentlemen , if after receiving a letter like that in response to your offer you would have urged it any further . Senator New . What was the indorsement upon that ? Col. Lewis . That is a letter written by Gen. Scriven , who is still living . He succeeded Gen. Allen as Chief Signal Officer . This was in 1912 . ( Page 706. ) // Senator Wadsworth . In the tests which resulted in the Birmingham contract , was American ammunition used ? Col. Lewis . Yes , sir ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the British service . We used Russian ammunition in the Russian service and Belgian ammunition in the Belgian service . We have been doing that for years . We are now delivering 300 Lewis guns every week to aeroplanes crossing the English Channel . That brings me to the point as to this question of making all the output of the factory of the aeroplane type . I will tell you what we are doing in Birmingham . They are making 300 a week for the aeroplanes and 1,300 a week for trench purposes . Both are carried on together . The reason it is not done here is that they want to kill the Lewis gun . The Chairman . Why do they want to do that ? Col. Lewis . They want to take the label off of it . The Lewis label will stick to the Lewis gun as long as Lewis is alive . Senator Hitchcock . It has been emphasized here that parts of the Lewis gun broke in its test in May , 1913 . Col. Lewis . I am glad that you touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun did not do well . That gun was made in England . It was made to fire American ammunition by our British company . Remember , I had taken two guns over there . They had to be dismantled . The test at Springfield , in 1913 , was with the last gun entered . In that test the guns were entered over my protest and against // my judgment and in spite of my personal protests . I did not want to send the guns up for the tests . It was put up to me by my associates that I should do it . Senator Hitchcock . I thought you were anxious to have the Government use the gun and to have it tested . Col. Lewis . Not at that time , I was not . Senator Hitchcock . Then , there was some warrant for Gen. Crozier 's statement that at the tests in 1913 that individual gun did not behave very well ? Col. Lewis . Do you mean that the parts broke ? Senator Hitchcock . Yes . Col. Lewis . So did every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested at the same time broke . Senator Hitchcock . Was there not some admission of that character made ? some official admis-sion ? Col. Lewis . I beg your pardon ? The Chairman . You had to confess that it did not meet the requirements . Col. Lewis . There was no confessing it . There is no use confessing such a thing when the broken parts are before you . The Chairman . That is not the question . Senator Hitchcock . I am asking you whether you know that any one had made that admission or not ? The Chairman . Yes . The admission , in substance , was that there had been a fair test and that the Lewis gun did not come up to the test shown by the other guns . // Senator Hitchcock . That was the 1917 test ? Col. Lewis . No , sir ; that was 1916 . Senator Hitchcock . Let us see the letter , if you have it there . Col. Lewis . I misunderstood you , Senator . Senator Hitchcock . It has been stated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several tests . Col. Lewis . At Springfield , yes . Senator Hitchcock . And that the tests were not satisfactory and that your company , or somebody connected with the company , admitted that the guns were not satisfactory . Col. Lewis . As I told you , the guns that we sent over for that test in 1913 were the first two guns made by the Birmingham Small Arms Company . There was a time limit ; the guns had to be here at a specific date , and if we did not send them here they could not be entered in official tests . We had never made an American gun over there . We were then making the British guns . The Chairman . And for British ammunition ? Col. Lewis . For British ammunition , yes . At that time we hurried with the two guns and converted them so they would be able to fire American ammunition , and the guns were sent over here without a sufficiently exhaustive firing test in England . We admit that . Senator Hitchcock . Who notified you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Calfee , arranged // that with Gen. Crozier , if I am not mistaken , very much against my judgment . Senator Hitchcock . So Gen. Crozier did give you an opportunity to present your gun for test in 1913 and again in 1916 ? ? Col. Lewis . Oh , no . I have been abroad since then . Senator Hitchcock . But Gen. Crozier gave you opportunity to have the Lewis gun tested on those two occasions ? Col. Lewis . The first test . I am not sure about the other test , because I have not been here . My son represented inc tat the test in 1913 , because he wanted to see the guns . I was fearful that they would not behave well , as they had not been tested at home . My son went before the board , and he had a very hard time because of the fact that many parts of ' the gun broke in that test , but still the gun fired 20,000 rounds of American ammunition in a very short length of time , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your factory in Great Britain turning out any considerable number of guns ? Col. Lewis . No ; we had not then turned out our first British gun at that time . These were the first two guns made ? the first two guns that the Birmingham Small Arms Company had made ? and they were not properly made . The material was not properly tempered . Senator Hitchcock . When was it that the factory in Birmingham began the output of the guns ? // Col. Lewis . On a large scale our first interchangeable guns were delivered to the British Government under contract in 1914 . I think it was in November , if I am not mistaken . I think war was declared on the 3d of August , and we did not get real deliveries of these interchangeable guns under our contract with the British Government , although we had been working eighteen months at it , until November of 1914 . I am quite sure , Senator . Senator Hitchcock . Prior to 1913 you were not in shape to offer guns to Gen. Crozier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Hitchcock . You had no factories estab-lished ? Col. Lewis . No ; certainly not . I had not the money to establish a factory . Senator Hitchcock . And when the test was made of your first output of the British factory it was premature ? Col. Lewis . Very much so , and against my judgment . Senator Hitchcock . And it failed on that occasion ? Col. Lewis . Simply on account of certain breakage of smaller parts , utterly minor parts , which did not affect the design of the gun . The design to-day is just as it was then , no better and no worse . Senator Hitchcock . Would you consider the test a failure l Col. Lewis . Certainly not . I have been witnessing government tests for nearly forty years , Senator . // Senator Hitchcock . What other guns were tested in 1913l Col. Lewis . The Coventry gun , the Vickers gun , the Madsden gun , and the Benet-Mereie , I think , were tested at that time . ( Page 710 . ) .. . Senator Hitchcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you make an effort to go over the head of Gen. Crozier to the Chief of Staff l Col. Lewis . I did . I went personally to him and offered him my gun . Senator Hitchcock . What was the attitude there ? Col. Lewis . They had a meeting of the board . They were both members of the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications . Gen. Wood , who was the senior member of the board , was absent , and that made Gen. Crozier ex officio president of the board in his absence . When the matter came up Gen. Wood was detained on other business , and Gen. Crozier , being ex officio president of the board , turned it down . Senator Hitchcock . And you were unable to get any one to overrule Gen. Crozier ? Col. Lewis . Oh , no . IIe is absolutely autocratic , Gen. Crozier . You gentlemen year after year have been hearing Gen. Crozier 's testimony in regard to the ordnance conditions in the country , and you can judge better the representations he has made than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a general way what is the trouble with the Ordnance Department ? You are an old Ordnance officer ? // Col. Lewis . No ; I am an Artillery man . I belong to the fighting branch . Senator Hitchcock . We have inferred that , Colonel . Col. Lewis . I am still fighting . I am sixty years old , but I am still in the ring . Senator McKellar . That is plainly evident . The Chairman . What is the trouble there ? If there has been a fall down in this emergency , where is the trouble and what is the trouble ? Col. Lewis . It is primarily at the present time with the man who is Chief of Ordnance . There has not been a new idea or a new development in ordnance in America in fifteen years . We have n't a new gun to-day in our coast fortifications ; that is , new within fifteen years . The Chairman . Are the methods at fault ? ? Col. Lewis . It is not so much Crozier as it is Crozierism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering from . The Chairman . Has he developed the Ordnance Department under this present system and method Col. Lewis ( interrupting ) . Certainly . It is a one-man machine , Senator . The Chairman . How long has he been connected with it ? Col. Lewis . Fifteen years ? I think , sixteen years . I think he has been Chief of Ordnance sixteen years . The Chairman . As a matter of fact , is not the system about as it was before he went in ? Col. Lewis . Oh , yes . It was the same thing // under his predecessor . I had the same trouble under his predecessor , also . The Chairman . That is what I am getting at . Col. Lewis . It is the system , Senator . The Chairman . It is not the man ; it is the system ? Col. Lewis . In my particular case it is the man . The head of a great bureau has simply used his office as a vehicle for personal malice and envy toward a man who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring , Senator , so I know there is one . Senator Weeks . What do you mean by the " ring , " Colonel " ? Just a moment before you answer that question . I think you are talking in a very desultory way and not accurately . You are pretty loquacious . Get right down to facts , and answer the question directly , and tell us what you mean by the ring . Col. Lewis . Ir I could tell you the system that has controlled the production of ordnance , the design of ordnance , and the purchase of ordnance , and supply or arras and ammunition ever since I have been in the service ? and I have had active contact with it for nearly thirty-eight years Senator Weeks . Do you mean to say there is anything dishonest about it ? Col. Lewis . No . I am not saying there is any pecuniary graft . There are many kinds of graft in this world besides money graft , Senator . Senator Weeks . What kind of graft do you mean ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polities , Senator . A man who is loyal to his party at the expense of the State is , to my mind , exactly analogous to the man who is loyal to a bureau chief at the expense of his country . That is what I mean by a ring . Senator Weeks . Let us commence with the bureau chief . In what respect is he at the head of a ring ? Col. Lewis . He is it . Senator Weeks . Assuming that he is it . Is not he following his judgment ? Col. Lewis . Why , presumably so ; yes . Senator Weeks . Then your charge reduces itself to the fact that he is inefficient ? Col. Lewis . Oh , it is hopelessly inefficient under our present bureau system . Senator Weeks . Anything else ? Col. Lewis . Prejudice , do you mean ? Professional prejudice ; yes . Senator Weeks . That would be included in inefficiency . Col. Lewis . Inefficiency , yes . I certainly do not mean corruption . Senator Weeks . You mean to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ; I do not say that . Senator Weeks . You said a moment ago Col. Lewis . There are still good men Senator Weeks . You said there had not been an ordnance expert developed in this country for fifteen years a moment ago . // Col. Lewis . I mean in the broad view of ordnance that is true . Senator Weeks . You mean to say there is not an efficient man in the Ordnance Bureau ? Col. Lewis . A man may be efficient in his limitations and not be an expert , Senator . There are lots of good , conscientious and efficient men that are not experts . ( Page 711 . ) .. . Senator Frelinghuysen . Col. Lewis , in August of 1912 , who was the Chief of Staff ? Col. Lewis . I think Gen. Wood was Chief of Staff . Senator Frelinghuysen . Did he not practically govern the policy of the Ordnance Department at that time ? Col. Lewis . No . The Chief of Staff does not govern its policy now , Senator . Senator Frelinghuysen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of War , if it has any government . Senator Frelinghuysen . Who was the Secretary of War in August , 1912 ? . Col. Lewis . T have been away so many years that I do not remember ; but I think it was Mr. Stimson . I can say that Gen. Wood has been very favorably disposed toward the Lewis gun and has been very much in favor of its adoption , Senator . Senator Frelinghuysen . Was he at that time ? Col. Lewis . Yes ; very much so . Senator Hitchcock . Do you attribute the failure on the part of the Army to adopt and use your gun to the constant opposition of Gen. Crozier ? // Col. Lewis . To him and his immediate coterie in the Ordnance Department . Senator Hitchcock . Can you name other officers ? Col. Lewis . Senator , I do not want to do any injustice to any younger officers . That is a one-man bureau , and I think one man ought to bear the brunt of it . ( Page 733 . ) .. . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summing it up here , that if the United States Government , through its Ordnance Department , had viewed the Lewis gun from the same friendly standpoint that it did the Browning gun , when it was originally introduced for its inspection , that the Lewis gun would have been accepted on its merits ? Col. Lewis . There would have been no Browning gun . Senator New . There would not have been any Browning gun ? Col. Lewis . No , sir . Senator McKellar . And you also think the United States Government would be better supplied with machine guns if it had adopted your gun , of course ? Col. Lewis . I certainly do , and a very much larger number of them . I might say among the letters attached to my letter inclosed to the Secretary you will find a letter of October 16th , addressed to the president of the Machine Gun Board , in which I offered to produce a light gun , such as the Browning is ; I offered to come back ? to give up my European work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my own expense ? and I would // present it to the Government without any compensation , direct or indirect , in any shape . Senator New . You made such an offer as that in October , 1916 ? Col. Lewis . Yes , sir ; I can read the letter . Senator New . Is that letter in the record ? I think it ought to go in the record . Col. Lewis . Col. Lewis had made machine guns , and Mr. Browning has not . Now , Mr. Browning is a great inventor , a great pistol and rifle inventor , but he never has made a machine gun . I offered to do it for nothing ; I would have been glad to ; I think it would have been as good a gun as the Browning , perhaps ? naturally , 1 think so ? it certainly would not have cost the Government $1,250,000 . Senator Frclinyhuysen . Did the Ordnance Department inform you that they would accept for test the Lewis gun rechambered to Springfield ammuni-tion Col. Lewis . They never informed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had nothing whatever to do with those tests ; I did not even know of them . Senator Frelinjhvysen . How was that test brought about ? the reopening of the negotiations ? Col. Lewis . I think the Savage Arms Company ? Mr. Borie , did you not take that up with the Savage Arms Company ? Mr. Borie . Yes , all those questions came up with us . Senator Frelinghuysen . What I am trying to develop , Mr. Borie , is this : That either through prejuMACHINE // dice or for scientific reasons the Ordnance Department objected to the use of the Lewis gun , and there were no tests made from August , 1912 , until we entered this war , and the Lewis gun was not in use . Mr. Bogie . There was a test made in 1913 , before I had anything to do with the gun . Senator Frelinghuysen . Nevertheless it was not accepted at that time ? Mr. Rorie . No , sir ; and in 1916 there was a partial test made , in which I was interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I recited this morning , the Ordnance Department bought 350 of the English guns , and then the Secretary of War took the matter of the machine-gun controversy out of the hands of the Ordnance Department and appointed this machine-gun board , consisting of nine men from all branches of the service . That was after rather an acrimonious correspondence between Gen. Crozier and myself , on which we insisted that the gun be given a fair test , not an armory or laboratory test , and suggested that a board composed of all branches of the service , including the Navy , should be appointed to pass on the gun . The machine-gun board met in the fall of 1916 and reviewed old tests , and after hearing from Mr. Hanson , for instance , whose letter I quoted as to the enormous capacity of the Colt works , they ordered some Vickers guns , and they set May 1 , 1917 , as a date to test all light machine guns . Then we entered the war , and I told you the rest of the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested for the Springfield ammunition ? our ammunition ? by the Ordnance Department i Mr. Borie . In 1916 we gave this partial test at Springfield ; it was not satisfactory . Mr. Frelinghuysen . Was it accepted ? Mr. Borie . No , sir ; the recommendation of the board was that the machine gun ? I think we have got the record somewhere here ? in the opinion of the board , it was not satisfactory for our service arm , but that in the opinion of the board the Savage Arms Company should continue to develop the gun , in the expectation that it would prove satisfactory . Was that not about the gist of it , Mr. Calfee ; was not that the gist of the report of the 1916 test ? You have got it in your records there . But the Lewis gun was not accepted by the United States Government as a standard arm until after the Winthrop test for the Navy , and then the other test at the Springfield Armory . Senator Hitchcock . Then you received an order for 1,300 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy . Senator Hitchcock . And subsequent to that you have received an order for Mr. Borie . Well , those orders I gave you ? 2,000 , 4,400 and 12,000 ; then 22,000 . Senator Frelinghuysen . Has the Lewis gun ever been officially adopted by the Ordnance Depart-ment ? Mr. Borie . It has been adopted as the service arm . // Col. Lewis . Yes , sir ; it has been since last May . ( Page 740 . ) . . . It appears from this testimony and the preceding narrative ( page 79 ) that when the Lewis gun was first officially offered to the Government for test it was offered with a string to it ; that the test should not be of the kind to which military inventions are usually subjected by the agencies maintained by the Government for the purpose , but should be of a particular kind , by another agency , proposed by the commercial company presenting the gun . The Board of Ordnance and Fortification , a statutory board for considering and testing inventions , composed of the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ordnance , three officers of Artillery and a civilian , did not turn the gun down in the absence of Gen. Wood as testified by Col. Lewis , but offered a test in which the usual procedure would be followed , and which would include the kind of test which those presenting the gun desired . The proceedings of the board setting forth this action were signed by Gen. Wood , as the presiding officer when they were taken . In the same month in which the test was offered by the board , July , 1912 , occurred the incident referred to by Col. Lewis of a proposed test of the Lewis gun in firing from an aeroplane , by the Signal Corps . The Signal Corps was not the agency for making tests of machine guns , had no experts or facilities for doing so , and undoubtedly wished only to test the firing of a machine gun from an aero134 ORDNANCE AND THE WORLD WAR plane . The matter is explained by the following correspondence between the Acting Chief Signal Officer and myself : 37819/392 . WAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , July 17 , 1912 . CHIEF OF ORDNANCE , UNITED STATES ARMY . Sir : I have the honor to state that it is contemplated trying the Lewis gun with the aeroplanes during the coning maneuvers to be held in the vicinity of New York , N. Y. , in August next , and it is requested that 5,000 rounds of ammunition for the service rifle he issued to the Signal Corps for the purpose . If it is considered necessary , reimbursement can be made by transfer of funds from appropriation Signal Service of the Army , 1913 . . Very respectfully , GEORGE P. SCRIVEN , Colonel , Signal Corps , U. S. Army , in charge of Office . 37819/396 WAR DEPARTMENT , OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF ORDNANCE , Washington , July 27 , 1912 . THE CHIEF SIGNAL OFFICER , U. S. ARMY . Sir : 1 . Replying to letter from your office , dated 17th instant ( O. O. 37819/392 ) , in regard to the supply of five thousand rounds of ammunition for the purpose of trying a Lewis gun with aeroplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // vicinity of New York City , I have the honor to inform you that this Department would not be authorized to supply ammunition for the trial of a gun not under test with reference to its adoption in the service , and that the representatives of the Lewis gun have not accepted the offer of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification to test their gun with reference to that object . 2 . I will be glad , however , to furnish the Signal Department with an automatic rifle of the present service type , which weighs about 22 pounds ; to fit it to an aeroplane , or to furnish the appliances for doing so , and to supply a suitable number of rounds of ammunition , without expense to the appropriations of the Signal Corps , for such test as you may desire to make with them . 3 . Of course , this Department will be glad to furnish any number of rounds to the Signal Department , at the expense of the appropriations of your Department , without question as to the purpose for which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Gen. , Chief of Ordnance , U. S. A. It is seen from these letters that I was willing to furnish ammunition at the expense of the Signal Corps ' appropriations for a test of the Lewis or any other gun , but the Acting Chief Signal Officer was governed by the view of the Chief of Staff quoted in the former 's letter to Col. Lewis , that " The whole matter of the test of this gun is now under consideration . Until the matter is settled , it is not believed any official action should be taken . " It was after his failure to secure this quasi test , as a side issue to a trial of machine gun fire from // an aeroplane , while there was still pending a definite offer to give his gun the usual test including one of his own kind , that Col. Lewis testifies that be retired from active service , discouraged and disappointed , and went to Europe to look after the manufacture of his gun ? after the European rights therein had been bought by a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire and go abroad because of refusal to consider and test his gun , but in order that he might command all of his time to exploit it for profit , while under pension by his Government . In the following spring , 1913 , the Automatic Arms Company , not having taken up the offer of the preceding July to test a Lewis gun , came forward again with a proposal that a gun be tested . The proposal was accepted ; the usual procedure of convening a board to conduct the test was followed , and the gun was tested , together with several other types , in the following September . This was the first test made by the United States Government of a Lewis gun , and it failed by malfunction and the breakage of parts . ( See page 81 , and the testimony of Col. Lewis quoted above . ) The claim in behalf of the gun that the failure was due to poor manufacture and defective material may very well have been true . Neither the Ordnance Department nor the Board of Ordnance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lewis gun ; but from the beginning , and after each failure , offered to make further tests of the gun if and when it should be desired . // From the preceding narrative ( page 82 ) it appears that no further proposition to test the gun was made until the Ordnance Department itself brought up the subject , in September , 1915 , by asking the Savage Arms Company to present a gun for test ; that company having taken up the manufacture for the Canadian army . Then it was not until April , 1916 , seven months afterward , that a gun was presented and a test held , with the poor result stated . This was the last official test under the War Department before the one of April , 1917 , under the Navy Department , which was the first at which the gun performed well , after many changes in it , and after which it was accepted and large orders were given by the Ordnance Department for its manufacture . But in the early part of June , 1916 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held at Plattsburg by a board convened by verbal order of Gen. Leonard Wood from among his own officers . The Lewis gun used in the test was one made by the Savage Arms Company to use British ammunition , and was reported by the board to have performed excellently in the test , while the Benet-Merci6 performed very badly . Report of the test was not made to the War Department by Gen. Wood until over a month afterward , in a letter of July 29th ; but a copy of the report of the board was furnished the Savage Arms Company , and the company sent a copy to the Secretary of War on June 29th . I received my first information of the test through the company , and in reply said , among other things : " I hope that this last // performance indicates that progress has been made in overcoming such defects as previous tests have shown , and that the gun in which this Government is now investing a considerable sum has reached a stage in which it can be relied upon to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun on the Mexican border , however , which has been previously described ( page 88 ) , showed that as made in this country it had not yet reached a reliable stage ; while the Plattsburg test itself was inconclusive in that less than 2,000 rounds were fired from the gun as against 20,000 or more required for a proper test , which should include at least 15,000 rounds for endurance . Notwithstanding the failures to get a performance from the Lewis gun , with either English or American ammunition , which would justify its adoption for the service I realized that the continued use of the gun by the English in the war , and the absence of effort on their part to replace it with another model , raised a presumption that it ought to be possible to manufacture it to give good service in this country . It was apparent , of course , that the American model was not the same as the English one ; and also the English use of the gun afforded no comparison between it and the Benet-Mercie , the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior by every board , except the Plattsburg one , which had considered both , and which is still the British model for the cavalry and for tanks . The Benet-Mercie , however , had been superseded in the United States by the Vickers ; the manufacture // of it here had ceased and the manufacturing equipment had been dissipated ; and , besides , the need for an additional type lighter than the Vickers had appeared . I , therefore , as related on page 97 , made the recommendation designed to afford two and a half months from the middle of August , 1916 , for the perfection and presentation for further test of a Lewis gun or any other , and reserving $6,000,000 for investment in the light of the test . The board appointed by the Secretary of War , however , reserved only $1,500,000 , and this sum was invested in it after the test of April , 1917 , had shown it to be fit for purchase . Col. Lewis ' charge of prejudice and unfair treatment for himself and his gun is accentuated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider his gun for test was in the face of an offer on his part , alleged to have been repeatedly made , to give the free use of the gun to the Government , without any payment of royalty to himself as the inventor . These statements were spread widely through the press , and are repeated in his testimony before the Senate Military Committee , as follows : Col. Lewis . I wanted to submit the gun unreservedly for the use of my Government , giving up all rights of whatever nature in the invention . ... I repeat , that I offered to give my gun to the Government . I made the offer to the Chief of Staff in 1912 . First I made the offer in 1911 and then again in 1912 . I also told the present Secretary of War , in his own office , in June , 1916 , when I
