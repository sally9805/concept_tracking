Suppose that U. S. President Coolidge were a bachelor . Then conceive how vexed he would have been last week , if some irresponsible French magazine had displayed a drawing which showed a doll-faced , frivolous-looking woman leaning out over a balcony and captioned " . . . The Wife of the President of the United States . . . . " <P> Such was precisely the indignity to which M. le Prsident Gaston Doumergue of the French Republic was subjected by a U. S. weekly , the New Yorker . This sophisticated magazine surely possesses at least one employe who knows that M. Doumergue is a bachelor . Yet , last week , the New Yorker , published a full page advertisement of the equally sophisticated monthly Harper 's Bazar in which a copy of the Bazar was shown fluttering down from an airplane into the hands of a doll-faced , bobbed-haired woman on a balcony . The caption : THE REAL REASON FOR THE TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS <P> The wife of the President of France <P> desires an advance copy of the <P> July Harper 's Bazar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 331/2 hours earlier-at <P> any newsstand . <P> <P> That two such smart-chart publications should have thus jointly trifled with the bachelorhood of M. Doumergue seemed , to Frenchmen in the U. S. , inexcusable.
