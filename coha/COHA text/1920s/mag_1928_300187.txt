Judge Emil Fuchs , * a paunchy and genial onetime Manhattan magistrate , is the President and owner of the Boston " Braves , " one of the worst baseball teams in the National League . Last week he did two things that aroused the excitement of baseball enthusiasts . <P> 1 ) He traded Rogers Hornsby , famed second baseman and manager of the Braves , to the Chicago Cubs for about $200,000 and five less famous players . <P> 2 ) He announced that when the season opened next spring , he would be the manager of the Boston Braves . <P> The manager of a baseball team is generally a onetime professional ballplayer ; it has always been supposed that he must be familiar with the strategies of the game and have played it well . Sometimes , like Hornsby , he plays and manages at the same time ; usually he directs his team from the field bench . Judge Fuchs is not a professional , not even an able , baseball player . Even if he were , he is too good-natured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For him to be a manager was absurd and astonishing ; he admitted that he would hire Johnny Evers , once a famed player , to be his assistant manager . <P> By instinct , training , and disposition , Rogers Hornsby is a superlatively good baseball player . Yet of late he has not stayed long on any " club . " Three years ago he was made manager of the St. Louis Cardinals ; they won the pennant and he was traded to the New York Giants , where he was captain and assistant manager ; last year he was traded to Boston where he squabbled with onetime manager Jack Slattery , a native of the city , and supplanted him as manager . Because Bostonian baseball fans were annoyed at this and because Rogers Hornsby demanded $50.000 yearly , Judge Fuchs sold him . Hornsby likes to bet on horse races ; he is imperious and impudent and in Chicago he will be neither captain nor manager but merely second baseman . Next winter again there may be horn-swoggling for Hornsby . <P> <P> * Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan .
