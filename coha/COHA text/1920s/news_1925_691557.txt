Some , unable to resist the lure of the sea which for so many generations had called their ancestors , stopped at the Atlantic ports or pushed through to the Pacific Northwest . Minnesota , the Dakotas , Wisconsin and Illinois , however , have claimed the majority of the children of Norway , who there took up the taming of a continent by the side . of Americans of New England , German and other origins .
