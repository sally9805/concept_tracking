That hoariest and most complacent of U. S. art groups , the National Academy of Design , is now holding its 103d annual exhibition in Manhattan . Academic has become synonymous with trite , stale and vapid in the vocabulary of artistic contumely . The present bulky show justifies the synonymy . There are 462 paintings , drawings , etchings , engravings , prints and pieces of sculpture on view . Most of them would be easily understood by the unexacting eyes of the billboard public . <P> Jes Schlaikjer 's South Dakota Evening , which won the first Altman prize of $1,000 , is a smouldering , vivid-color scheme , a boldly massed composition .
