WE have been sitting beside a win- dow , engaged upon some intricate and absorbing piece of work . All at once we have become aware that far away something is happening . We look up , blinking , into the light , and with a conscious physical effort adjust the focus of our eyes to the distant perspective . Far off , against the horizon , a vast commotion has begun , a violence set up . Vague and dim at first , it grows in size and intensity . Our gaze and our emotions are fixed upon it . We see nothing between . We have forgotten everything else . It continues a long time , and we remain with our vision strained upon . it . . . Suddenly the commotion ceases , the violence subsides . With a shock we realize that there is nothing more to see . Remembering our work , we withdraw our gaze from the horizon and attempt to focus it again within the room . But we can see nothing , our eyes ache , and the light swims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we had been engaged has dropped from our hands . We grope for it , and overturn some familiar piece of brie-1-brac . We rise and walk about , stumbling against the familiar tables and chairs , declaring aloud that they were never in those positions before , that some one has disarranged the room . . . . It is something like this that has happened of late to the world . We are , all of us , undergoing what the oculists call the " spasm of accommodation , " and it would almost seem that the ciliary muscle , which controls that necessary operation , had been hopelessly strained , if not completely destroyed . Add , then , to this confusion the fact that no two of us ever see alike ; thatthe world suffers from astigmatism of a very complicated form ; that most men are born with myopic or hyperopic eyes ; and we have something approximating the state of our vision to-day . Memories come to mind , illustrations , analogies . I recall the story of an acquaintance , a woman whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was during her first year at public school that the innovation of free medical examination of school-children was established , and she was among those who were given notes to their parents saying that they must have glasses . Accordingly she was taken to an oculist . On the day when she was to return for the glasses an elder sister was sent with her ; she put . on the new glasses and , holding her sister 's hand , descended the stairs that led from the oculist 's office to the street . When they reached the pavement she stopped and cried out , excitedly , clutching her sister 's dress : " Look ! Over therel Look ! " " What is it ? " the sister asked in alarm . " Over there ! Over there ! " She was pointing in great agitation . " There 's another side to the street ! " " Why , of course , " said the sister . " What 's strange about that ? " " But I 've never seen it before ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not ? How many citizens , publicists , statesmen , persons in authority , do we know who seem not to be aware that there is " another side to the street " ; and who deny , quite logically from their point of view , the existence of the stars ? Yet they sit in the seats of the mighty , make laws to govern the world . They , and another class ? men with an extreme hyperopia , men born , it would seem . with telescopic eyes , who can sce nothing close to them , who are aware of nothing this side of the stars . And if anywhere among them there be reasonable men , men with normal sight , they are easily proved mad , since both the near and the far-sighted will declare them so . They will he shouted down by the extremists on both sides . One can imagine the American Senate , for example , being fitted with corrective spectacles . A disk , with black letters and figures , the letters spelling " The League of Nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures " Foreign Credits " or " The Cost of Armament " ; this disk set up on the Presiding Officer 's desk , and the Senators trying on pair after pair of spectacles , until they are all seeing the same thing , and seeing it alike . But where is the oculist with the authority ? And if he have the authority , where is one with the wisdom ? And if one be found with both the wisdom and the authority , how shall the gentlemen of the Senate be persuaded that they need spectacles ? For that is the real sticking-point . They are ? to go hack to the story of the public-school examinations ? like the children of Christian Scientists who resist the examination of their eyes on the ground that there is no such thing as astigmatism . There is only truth . And that is plain for anyone to see . They stand upon their rights . And they are not , any of them , precisely to blame . They do not know , just as the child who had never worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their sight . We all believe that normality begins with ourselves , and that abnormality is a divergence away from us . There is the story of H. G. Wells 's which recounts the adventures of a man who strays into " The Country of the Blind , " where the inhabitants , who have no eyes , consider him mad and keep him under guard . Daylight and darkness are one to them , and they move about , guided by the acuteness of other senses , quite as freely by night as by day . But at night thestranger gropes his way uncertainly , as if he were blind , or the victim of hallucinations or of some strange malady . During the day he talks irrationally of distant things which he claims to " see . " And when they assemble at midnight , their favorite hour for important affairs , in the windowless council-chamber , to consider his ease , he stumbles and falls against them drunkenly . Obviously there is something seriously wrong . The wise men decide that it is due to the abnormality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing their hands across his face , and he is again put under guard . In the end he submits to having his eyes destroyed , that he may become like his captors and live his life among them in freedom and peace . Well , there are times enough when it is easy to believe that we have become that Country of the Blind . Only ? such a condition would permit of agreement , and there is no such simplification of our complexities as that. ? Our difficulty lies in the fact that there exists among us , not a uniform defect of sight , but every possible degree , every imaginable phase . Talk with five different men on any subject at all . Within five minutes each man will have revealed his particular focus , his mental boundary . Within another five minutes he will have revealed its origin . He who has suffered religious oppression in his youth will account for all oppression in that way . " It 's religion , " he will say . Another will blame everything upon ill health . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another upon a political party . And so on and on . We all know the adjustment of focus necessary to conversation with different friends . If I am talking with my friend Brown , who is a radical of radicals , I am at once committed to certain tacit admissions necessary to our getting anywhere at all . If I wish to get the views of my friend Smith , who is a confirmed reactionary , I begin by tacit admissions of quite another set of facts . Unless , of course , I am merely argumentative , and wish to know nothing from either of them . I appear in this to contradict myself , but in reality I have done nothing of the sort . For Smith will accuse me of anarchy upon the same statement for which Brown will cry me down as reactionary . So , schoolboy or savant , fool or sage , artist or clod , I am apparently contradicting myself a dozen times a day . Yet I have only adjusted my focus to theirs , accepted their perspective for the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the only way we can discover what people really think , or convey to them the thing we think ourselves . To be inconsistent is , in such cases , the only way to preserve our consistency . We can not oppose our perspective to theirs , or we are spent in mere opposition , and there is nothing left . To be sure , there are people who insist upon preserving a fixed focus , an inflexible point of view . Such people will talk seriously of the nebular hypothesis to a child of six , complain of the price of darning-cotton to a millionaire , or urge the excellence of exercise to a paralytic in a chair . They preserve their point of view intact . And although as companions they arc neither wise , witty , nor agreeable , it can not be denied that they have added much to the richness and variety of the human comedy . But , then , the fixed focus is the " oceitI pational disease " of politics . Indeed all public men seem foredoomed to it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public life . Even in the printed utterances of men whom we have come to regard as leaders of constructive thought , men in whom we have been accustomed to repose our confidence , we encounter the sudden boundary , are baffled by it , stopped . Just as we are hoping that here at last is an authentic , an unbiased word , we come all at once to the horizon at . which his vision stops ; why , we do not know , unless , as is often the case , some purely personal experience has bound him there , has made it the point beyond which he is not able to see . Or , more often than we Iike to suspect , until he has gained his point , he does not choose to see . He has a partisan view to uphold , and he is strong only in so far as he can persuade the rest of us to accept his view as the ultimate boundary of truth . No matter how great his vision may really be , he will not admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , or his power is gone . Only a few days ago I saw on a typewritten list of qualifications for applicants to undertake an investigation and report on a work involving the public pod this qualification , " And the ability to see and accept our point of view as to what constitutes the public good . " And fur any point of view endless authority can be produced . The authentic testimony of experts will prove it true . There is probably no viewpoint held by a single member of the Congress of the United States that is not conclusively proved by some expert 's report now in the hands of that body . Whenever the contest becomes too violent they send out experts , all sides , to prove themselves in the right . So that Congress presents the spectacle of a vast repository of unrelated and incontrovertible facts ? reports of experts about everything under the sun . This brings us to the contemplation of the saddest form of all , the malignant myopia of experts , of specialists . They are aggravated cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of their malady which puts them in the position of the fat lady of the circus , who dares not change her diet , but must continue to eat such foods as will increase her infirmity . From years of concentration , of fixed gazing upon a certain point , the muscle of accommodation atrophies . It is almost never that a specialist escapes . To become an expert is , in spite of oneself , to give up other things and to lose the sense of relationship of the object to the rest of the world . The business of an expert is to take a thing out of its relationships and examine it . He illustrates the lasting fallacy of the too-near view . Nothing is so liable to error as the testimony of the man who has not stood far enough away . There is Inure misinformation to be had from the man who has " been there " than from him who has studied it afar . Who , within the year , has escaped the experience of listening to the truth about the war expounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at close range ? And there is no contradicting these people . " I was there , I saw it with my own eyes ; I certainly ought to know . " Inside information , which is always so exactly the reverse of outside information ! What they say is undoubtedly true as personal experience . But not the truth about the war , because the sum of all the facts is not at all the truth about the war . I know a man and wife who were pro-German throughout the war for no greater reason than that the wife had once , years ago , spent an uncomfortable two weeks in an unheated English boarding-house , and that her discomfort was sympathetically shared by two German officers with very correct and charming manners ; and that the experience gave her a severe cold from which she did not recover until she crossed to Germany where she found a boarding-house with sufficient heat . . . . It seems incredible , but it is true . She was led into the most extravagant statements , and her husband hypnotically followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest . And I do believe that must of our strongest prejudices are based at bottom upon some such trifling personal experience as that . In the same way a Californian will assert with an air of serious authority the necessity and the imminence of an American-Japanese war . And he will offer as proof the fact that once in California he had a Japanese servant who , one day when the family was away , stole all the loose change in the bureau and twelve solid-silver spoons from the dining room and disappeared . If this is not considered sufficient proof of the trickiness of the Japanese , he will repeat the well-worn statement that " the Japanese ca n't even trust themselves ! In Japan all the banks employ Chinese officers and clerks , because the Chinese ? Now , the Chinese .. . . ! " And then will follow the invariable reminiscence of the faithful Sing , who ran the house , who gave the family presents , who saved them money , and was with them twenty years . All true stories , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might lead to war . Nevertheless , if that war should ever come to pass , the Californian will nod his head and gravely say , " I told you so , " and be convinced that he has been a keen observer of international polities . How often have people sought to prove to us the integrity and complete trustworthiness of some public man because our informant once lived across the street from him , and knew him to be a genial neighbor , an indulgent husband and father , and generous to the poor ? Or , on the contrary , they may seek to prove his public motives mean and fraudulent because he was an exclusive neighbor , strict with his family , and did believe in charity . From which personalities , as everyone reasonably knows , no deduction can be . drawn , unless , indeed , the one of opposites ? since how often do we find public scoundrels to be models of all the virtues in private life , and public benefactors proved petty rogues and tyrants in their homes ? Often enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule . Your cynic is always skeptical of any man whose private virtue is extolled . Yet so strong is the fallacy that almost any man who will cultivate a genial personality , practice private charity , and display a marked affection for children and animals , may plunder the public with impunity . It is an old saying , but the , that wit is better than argument in a political campaign , and that a funny story wins more votes than reasoning . Now all these may seem the most trivial and commonplace of instances , but that is precisely why I have chosen them . For I did not set out to compose a philosophical treatise upon the defective vision of man . I am only attempting to call attention to the most prevalent manifestations of Elie malady , and , if you will , by these homely , every-day examples , to clarify the symbol of an astigmatic world . And here I am reminded of a lecture by Rabindranath Tagore , in which the point was otherwise and far more beautifully made . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway musical comedy held sway . A man came out upon the stage . He had a request to make of the audience . He wished to ask them to refrain from trying to make any social engagements with " The Master , " and , above all , not to press forward to the stage after the lecture and attempt to shake hands or speak to him . We would understand that " The Master " had brought his message to us at the cost of great personal sacrifice ; that he had been in America now several months , and that it was impossible to exaggerate the seriousness of the effect upon one unaccustomed as he was to the crudities , the grossness , and the confusion of our western world . It was necessary to take the utmost precaution to guard his health , in order that he might be able to appear before us at all . He could meet no one . The speaker departed , very business-like , as he came , without making the usual introduction of the celebrity . At once there entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gray-robed figure of Tagore , bearing at that distance a startling resemblance to the idealized pictures of Christ , with his calm , ageless face , his serene , fine eyes , his long white hair and beard . He advanced to the center of the great empty stage , holdingin his hands a manuscript , bound in gray like his robe , from which he began to read , without greeting or preface , merely lifting up his voice , that amazing strange falsetto , which so astonished me at first that I did not hear what he was saying , but listened only to the absurd quality of that thin , high voice , which yet was clearly audible , and without accent , except for a kind of deliberate precision , and which had the curious effect of simply detaching the words from the manuscript and suspending them aloft in the rarefied atmosphere . And , caught presently by the intimation of some word , and listening back , I heard from the beginning what he had said : " The night is like a dark child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars crowding round its cradle watch it , standing still , afraid lest it should wake up . . . . I am ready to go on in this strain , but I am interrupted by Science laughing at me . She takes objection to my statement that stars are standing still . But if it is a mistake , then apology is not due from me , but from the stars themselves . IL is quite evident that they are standing still . It is a fact that is impossible to argue away . But Science will argue ; it is her habit . She says , ' When you think that stars are still that only proves that you are too far from them . ' I have my answer ready , that when you say that stars are rushing about it only proves that you are too near them . . . . " Science is astonished at my temerity . But I obstinately hold my ground , and say that if Science has the liberty to take the side of the near and fall foul of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite side and question the veracity of the near . . .. The difficulty is to decide whom to trust . The evidence of the world of stars is simple . You have but to raise your eyes and see their face and you believe them . ' They do not set before you elaborate arguments . They do not break their hearts if you refuse to believe them . . . . We see that the world of stars is still . For we see these stars in their relation to one another . But astronomy , like a curious child , plucks out an individual star , and then we find the story different . Therefore , let us boldly declare that both facts are equally true about the stars . . . . Because we see things in various adjustments of time and space , . therefore iron is iron , water is water , and clouds are clouds for us . " Accustomed by this time to the strangeness of his voice , I was able to follow now only the course of his thought while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realms of pure and always poetical reasoning to the ultimate relativity of things . A mystical Einstein . A seer who held in his hands the round crystal of Truth , into which for a little while he permitted us also to gaze . That perfect sphere which encompasses the beginning and the end , the within and the without , spirit and matter , reality and unreality , the finite and the infinite . But when presently he passed from sight we woke to find that he had taken the crystal away with him . . . . The doors of the theater opened , and there was Broadway again . Once more we were in the midst of all that confusion of noise and blatant life from which it was necessary to guard " The Master " so carefully . And I experienced the sudden hope that The Master had not lingered hi the wings , for if the gay flock of chorus girls who passed at the moment on their way in through the stage entrance to twelve-o'clock rehearsals should encounter him there , his crystal of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe of a dainty patent-leather shoe . But turning my head , I saw a closed motor-car drive away from the stage door , and I knew that The Master and his crystal were safe . For inc that morning has always had the quality of a remembered dream ? as aloof from the problems of our daily life . But a dream which seems to interpret itself as a symbol of - the difference invision between the eastern and the western worlds , the Old World and the New . Tagore , in his long gray robe , has gone from us , back to his native land , that land of the East where all men 's eyes are fixed upon the eternal mysteries . They suffer the illusion of the far ; we , the illusion of the near . For nature has made youth short of sight , and given to age the distant view It is an Eastern saying that " the eyes of the great are dim . " " All is illusion ! " cry their philosophers ; " all is unreality . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we come to the end of life , are willing to say it with them , for in the end it is true . But it is the far perspective of the old . And they of the East are an ancient race , whose eyes see past the world . For the petty problems of this earth they have long since accepted rules which serve . But we of the West are young , and before us is our many-faceted life to live . We have no laid down rules ; our problems are all with us to be solved , our decisions to be made . We wrestle with material devils , employ our wits in strategy to clothe and provision ourselves . It is folly to say to us that these things are unrealities . It is folly to ask youth to forswear its world . For us Science is not " a curious child , " but our wisest sage . After a night in the astronomer 's tower we are ever afterward ashamed to say that stars are still . It pleases us to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tireless activity . We can not find a telescope too powerful . We have a passion for knowing the most intricate facts about everything . And one of these facts will blind us to the rest . We must disintegrate everything into its parts and examine each part separately . And if now and then among us there is born a mtrn with the gift of mobile sight , one for whom the relationships of things are evident , he straightway becomes a philosopher , and withdraws himself from us . For even our philosophers are specialists . So it is that . the carrying on of our : ivilization is left in the hands of men of he fixed short sight . Men who - have ooked so long at one point that they ! onceive it to be the ultimate need of heir fellow men , and they begin to roselytize . So " leaders " rise up , so ' world movements " are begun . And , seeing how easily we are led hither and thither by nearsighted leaders like these , how easily we are persuaded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , it is not to be wondered at that our philosophers stand apart , or that we are sometimes weary enough to say with the wise men of older civilizations : " All is illusion . All is unreality . ' there is nothing but the One ! "
