F OR a good many years those interested in modern art in New York have found their chief amusement as well as their chief shame in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum . It was said that the only way to get a C ? zanne into the collection was to sneak it up the stairs some night and hang it . Then , by the time they got around to shifting the hangings , it would be an old master . In September of this year Murdock Pemberton published a series of Impertinent Questions in Creative Art , among which were the following : What is your objection to pictures by the younger living artists ? Failing to provide museum space for the work of contemporary men who have not received the accolade of the Academy , would you consider spending $10,000 a year on unknown Americans and giving them a fortnightly or monthly show ? Did you have a chance to buy Cezannes when Stieglitz tried in vain to sell them at $40 apiece ? Could you tell a good picture if it were offered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly one finds that a cold attitude toward the moderns is perhaps the least of the Museum 's faults . If it were hostile it might have a great and intelligent love for something else . But in fact it does not show itself particularly hostile to the moderns , or adverse to buying unknown men , or particularly aggressive and intelligent in collecting the old . In the end , the task of a public museum is not especially to encourage contemporary art . That is up to the artists and the private enthusiasts . Nor should it be to specialize in one narrow field so as to outrival every other institution in possessing the work of some artist or period . Its job is to excite the public to an interest in art and to inform it as to its history . To do this a museum must have works of the highest quality in every field , and enough of these to give a conception of the variety of each period . Then again , the largest part of its collection should be made up of works which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that end , leaving the finer points in history to be taken care of by the specialists . It is in this duty that the Metropolitan Museum fails more completely than in its appreciation of the moderns , and it is a failure that is considerably more serious . Of course , in the collection of old masters the Museum is handicapped by reason of its age in comparison with museums abroad . Yet , granting this , a lack of intelligence and aggressiveness has been in evidence ever since the Museum became a competitor . For example , compare it with the National Gallery of London . Let us take twelve painters of unquestionable merit who were also prolific and compare the examples of their work possessed by each , according to the museums ' most recent catalogues . Let us confine ourselves to artists who are foreign to both countries so as to eliminate the effects of patriotism . It is obvious that a museum 's policy is most clearly shown by what it buys . The Metropolitan Museum was organized in 1870 . However , it took time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the Rogers bequest in 1903 that the Museum was in a position to buy quite as it wished . That year it spent $244,139.09 on works of art . For the next ten years its average was $271,140.03 , spending in the last year of that decade $373,774.23 . In 1926 , the year of its last catalogue , the figure had risen to $1,145,316.75.1 Making the comparison , then , from 1903 , we find : The National Gallery has seven Velasquez 's of which one was bought after this date ; the Metropolitan , two given . The National Gallery has thirty-six Rubens 's , none bought after that date ; the Metropolitan nine , three bought . The National Gallery has nineteen Rembrandts , one bought ; the Metropolitan , the same number , given . The National Gallery has seven Raphaels , one bought ; the Metropolitan , one given . The National Gallery has five Tintorettos , one bought ; the Metropolitan , three , all purchased . The National Gallery has seven Titians , one bought ; the Metropolitan , one , given.2 Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has eight , of which six were bought ; the National Gallery , thirty-three , none purchased after 1903 . Of Delacroix and Ingres , the Metropolitan has four , all bought ; the National Gallery , seventeen , fourteen purchased . In total the National Gallery has within these years bought nineteen and the Metropolitan sixteen . While the result is not a crushing victory for the National Gallery in point of numbers , it becomes more complete when we consider that the National had ninety-nine examples of these men before our chosen date , and the Metropolitan just six . Strangely enough , if we compare the figures since the opening of the World War , we find that the National Gallery has purchased sixteen paintings to the Metropolitan 's nine , though the Metropolitan spread its paintings over six men to the National Gallery 's four . However , let us not stop with the big names but take the completeness of representation by country . It would be cruel to compare the Metropolitan 's Italian collection with those of museums abroad , for we can not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orcagnas , the Duccios , the Cimabues , which those museums had the fortune to inherit ; nor the Dutch and Flemish . Still what about the French ? The preface to the catalogue of the exhibition of French primitives held at the Kleinberger Galleries in New York in October , 1927 , said that it was only between two and three decades ago that the world became aware of the importance of these works . Then : In consequence of the exhibition of 1904 of French primitives in Paris the Louvre , aware of its gaps and in order to complete its collections , hastened to acquire some of the masterpieces of French primitive painting . Why then has the Metropolitan no example of Jean Malouel , or of his school ; of Henri Bellechose , Jean Fouquet , Michel Colombe , La Maitre de Moulins , the two Clouets , Nicholas Froment ? Of the important men of these centuries the Annual Reports of the Metropolitan Museum , 1871-1927 The Museum has , since the issuance of its catalogue of 1926 , bought a Rubens and a Titian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete information on the accessions of the National Gallery and have therefore let the comparison stand Museum has just three paintings : a school panel of Simon Marmion , and two portraits by Corneille de Lyon , all of which were given to it . From the seventeenth century to the nineteenth the list is not much better . The Museum has no example of Watteau ; none of Fragonard or of Rigaud , Lancret , La Tour , Le Brun . It has three Le Nains , two Chardins , three Poussins , two of Largilli  --  re , one of Claude , two Bouchers , four of Greuze , two Nattiers , one of David . In other words , of the fifteen important men of two centuries it has twenty examples distributed over nine of them . Of the nineteenth century its collection , because it could so easily have been so much better , is a disgrace . Two Delacroix . Why could it not have had some of the ten bought at the Degas sale in 1918 by the National Gallery ? Two Ingres . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gericault , one Daumier , two Millets . Of Corot , Courbet , de Chavannes , and Monet , good numbers : thirteen , seven , four , and four . Of Manet , three . The National Gallery has seven of which five were bought between 1918-1926 . Of Cezanne , one ; of Degas , one ; of Renoir , one ; of Redon , one , a sketch ; of Gauguin , none ; of Van Gogh , none ; of Toulouse-Lautrec , none ; of Seurat , none ; of Pissarro , none ; of Forain , none . Plainly from its inclusion of Cezanne and Renoir the Museum is not afraid of the new school of the last century . Then why not the others and why not more of the ones we have ? The National Gallery has three C ? zannes , nine Degas 's , three Renoirs . Of those the Metropolitan has none of , the National Gallery has the following : three Gauguins , four Van Goghs , two Pissarros , two Forains , two Seurats , one Toulouse-Lautrec . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan on this score . The Art Institute of Chicago has four Renoirs , two Degas 's ; five Pissarros , three Gauguins ; one Forain . The Museum of Fine Arts of Boston has listed in its catalogue of 1921 four Degas 's , two Pissarros , two Renoirs . Of these men the National Gallery has bought nineteen examples , the Metropolitan and the Art Institute two , and the Boston Museum one . But perhaps the directors felt that as long as there was such a charming collection across the East River , theirs could be neglected . In the Brooklyn Museum one can find a Cezanne , three Degas 's , two Toulouse-Lautrees , two Pissarros , two Forains , a Renoir , a sketch , and a Gauguin . Of these five were bought . In the twentieth century the Museum has no examples of Matisse , Picasso , Derain , Segonzac , Braque , Forain , Utrillo , Vuillard , Bonnard , Modigliani . These painters were once , like the Cezannes Mr. Pemberton speaks of , to be bought at bargains . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what the French collection of the twentieth century is likely to be like when so far it consists of one water-color copy of Manet 's " Olympia " by Jacques Villon . In the section of American painting much the same condition exists . The Museum boasts3 that " The collection of American art of today . . . is the most complete branch of the collection and gives a wide representation of what is being done in our own country . " It is without a Marin , an O'Keeffe , a Preston Dickenson , a McFee , a Chapin , a Sheeler , a Hartley , a Leon Kroll . In its collection of sculpture one does not expect the Museum to compete with the public monuments abroad . Among the more recent , the only really excellent group is that of Barye ; and the only extensive one , that of Rodin . ' Metropolitan Museum Catalogue of Paintings , 1926 , xii It has one Epstein , the head of an American soldier . The Tate Gallery has , if I remember correctly , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Government has granted him commissions for two public monuments . The Metropolitan has none of Maillol , who is generally considered the greatest of living sculptors . It owns no Despiaus . The Luxembourg bought one of his busts as long ago as 1912 . It owns no Bernard . The Luxembourg has two . It has no Lachaise , no Archipenko , no Brancusi . It has a " Herakles " and a " Beethoven " by Bourdelle , of which it bought the latter , and a head by the rather advanced sculptor , Allan Clark . It has bought , too , a good number of Dianas , a " Song of the Wave , " a statue called " Needless Alarms , " in which a nude girl is frightened by a toad , and an " Ephebe " by Louis Aime Le Jeune , the original of which is in the Luxembourg . What is the reason for this series of omissions ? Not prejudice . Some of these men are represented in the print room , where they are seldom seen except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged temporary exhibits of modern decorative art and has a small but fairly representative collection of its own . The reason is hardly that the names are unknown . Many of them have been so much discussed that they are as familiar as old masters . The causes are generally said to be " old fogyness " and committeeism . The directorate is certainly not composed of men who have distinguished themselves by their understanding of current movements in art . Neither are they , with possibly a few exceptions , known as independent scholars or connoisseurs of the past . It is the common museum blight . Some museums , such as the National Gallery and the Art Institute , seem to have overcome it . Others , such as the Louvre and Boston Museum , have had more fortunate gifts . Still , what would become of a bank directed by artists who deprived the financiers they hired to run the bank of any power to make a loan or place a mortgage ? Again , there seems to have been a misapplication of funds . It is useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since one does not know the prices paid ; but the vastly more numerous purchases of pieces of ancient decorative art ? Coptic , German , Turkish , Persian , and so forth  --  of pieces of ancient armament , of steel engravings done after old masters , of portions of Chinese and other deities , point to funds spent where they are not most useful.4 For , however excellent these things are in themselves , they have not the importance for the public of major works of painting and sculpture , especially those in the European tradition ; and until such collections are better than they are , the others should be more neglected .
