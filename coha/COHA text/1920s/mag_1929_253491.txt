Dentists v. Editors <P> Sirs : <P> In your last issue you made the statement that " there was a time when Mussolini looked like a dentist or a dental student , " and you further added that the same deplorable condition was true of King Alexander , who similarly " used to be of insignificant appearance . " <P> The presence of such a rash statement in your otherwise sane periodical is not only a shock to many of us dentists , insignificant as we are , but it is also a distinct surprise . We had thought you more observant . May we suggest that you cast your eye about among the noble members of your own so-called profession of journalism ? If you are not struck by the great number of insignificant looking humans , not to mention the morons and absolute idiots that must adorn your offices , then we dentists will haul in our shingles and shuffle off into shameful oblivion . <P> Your simile concerning Mussolini should have been " as weak-faced as an editor " thus making his rise to fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most tactful compliment , <P> We are Two Imbecile Doctors , <P> T. J. TRAYNOR , D. D. S. D. J. ROACH , D. D. S. <P> To sore-vexed Dentists Traynor and Roach all credit for an apt retort . The fact is that Benito was an editor-editor of the Socialist weekly , La Lotto , di Classe ( The Class War ) - when the " insignificant " photo was taken. - ED . <P> " Poor Devil " <P> Sirs : <P> The enclosed open letter which the New York Times published is entirely too long for your columns . But as you commented sarcastically on the high tariff crowd this week , I enclose it . There are two or three sentences which might interest that particular editor who is so expert at " boiling down . " <P> CALEB CABOT <P> Andover , Mass . <P> TIME spoke factually , not sarcastically , about " the high tariff crowd . " <P> The open Cabot letter said in part : " Now I , as a poor devil of a consumer , have been looking for some crumb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make inquiries , but am informed ' there ai n't no core . ' We should be satisfied to stand out in the cold and snow , look in through the plate glass windows and see the animals fed . For we are merely consumers . And so long as the manufacturers and skilled workers organize and we do not , we can expect no relief at Washington . ... " Consumer Cabot suggested , for example , admitting finished suits duty-free , to bring down the tariff-sustained price of men 's clothing. - ED . <P> Cannon 's Size , Cannon 's Color <P> Sirs : <P> I notice in your issue of Feb. 4 , page 34 , under the heading " Cannon 's Reward , " you say : " On Feb. 14 a very determined little Virginian will board the White Star Liner , Calgaric , bound for the Mediterranean for the Holy Land . He will be dressed in the black cloth of the clergy . " <P> As it is my understanding you desire that your paper shall be accurate in its statements , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above statement refers is 5 feet , 9 inches tall , weighs 180 pounds , wears a Number 42 coat . He will be dressed , not in black , but in gray , which is his favorite color . Bishop JAMES CANNON JR .
