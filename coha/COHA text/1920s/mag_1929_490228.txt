SOME months ago we spoke of the possibility that electric welding might replace riveting in thr erection of buildings . We spoke lightly . We were able to then . Now the riveters have moved in on us with their devilish machines . They are right next door and one of them is driving through the wall of our office now and will be at our head in twenty minutes . As we understand it , welding is not only silent but is cheaper and safer than riveting , and just as simple to do . The only things that stand in its way are the inexorable building code and the opposition of contractors , who all love a racket . Against the hell of air-driven torture machines the protestations and postures of Messrs . La Guardia and Walker mean less and less . We seek a man who will hold up his hand and command silence . Let either of them come out for welding and we will endorse him  --  if we can make ourself heard . THE bars have been let down al- most to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage or in books . Almost any word can be uttered in polite society , or set in CasIon type . The fact is , we were beginning to get a trifle worried about so complete an emancipation , and were wondering if any institutions remained on the side of Puritanism , or even on the side of good taste . Really , it was with quite a feeling of relief that we learned , in a Western Union office , that we could n't send the word " lousy " over the wires . Thanking our stars that the country was still respectable , we made an honest effort to think of a synonym for " lousy , " failed , and hurried over to a Postal office to dispatch the message .

We had chucked doormen under the chin ; we had exploded a paper bag in the reading-room of the Library ; we had driven the wrong way in a one-way street .

Somehow it does us good to hear of such a person  --  whose dignity remains unruffled in the face of a barbarous society . This man , before prohibition , held his employees to a strict adherence to national , state , and police laws ; everything was highly orthodox . In those days the lights of his establishment were switched off promptly at midnight . They still are . And you still enter through swinging doors , unchallenged . The house still buys liberally , just as it always did . A sign , " Speakeasy , " hangs over the bar . After all , there is nothing like a certain pride in one 's chosen profession . English Baseball ING LARDNER has been at it again and has got things into a big mess at East Hampton . They had a ballSEPTEMDER 14 , 19 29 game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bat in the third inning and bunted . The ball was fielded and thrown to first , a flawless play , and the runner was out a mile  --  or he would have been if he had n't done something unexpected and ridiculous . Instead of running to first he ran to third , where he arrived breathless but pretty smugly satisfied with himself . This caused general excitement . Old Lardner was surprised when they told him he was out , that he should n't have run to third . He was sullenly obdurate when the whole Sons team mobilized from all quarters of the field and protested loudly in a body . He explained that he had learned the game in England and that there the batter ran to third when he had hit the ball . When it was bitterly pointed out that Long Island is n't England , Old Lardner made the point that no signs had been put up telling a runner which way to go  --  had they ? This argument , supported by the runner 's obvious intention of remaining on third base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger players retired to their positions and the game went on , but by glances they conveyed to Young Lardner that they held him responsible for having such a stubborn boob for a father . On the next pitched ball , OId Lardner stole second . This again surprised everybody but nothing was done about it . On the next ball he stole first . Here they made a play for him . If the catcher had been half a second quicker they would have had him out . This seemed somehow to legitimatize Old Lardner 's being on base . At rate nobody said anything , and he ran home when the new batter made a hit , passing the latter halfway between first and the plate . The game went on , but hard feeling cropped up from time to time ; and it has since . None of his friends will speak to Young Lardner , Young Lardner wo n't speak to Old Lardner , and the situation generally is so disagreeable that the family may have to move somewhere else . Husband 's Reasons AGENTLEMAN who depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone the other day and inadvertently received an invitation for a weekend with a family he would n't think of visiting . Caught thus , he had to struggle through the situation alone . " I 'm very sorry , " he said , " but I 'm called to Cleveland for the air races and wo n't be back until next Tuesday . " " Then how about next weekend ? " inquired the caller . " I 'm afraid that 's out too , " he said , and , thinking fast , went on , " Ahwe 've got to go to a funeral a week from Sunday . " Anderson I was intended that John Murray 1 Anderson , creator , most recently , of that pictorially successful show , " Almanac , " start out to be a diplomat  --  in case you do n't know about him . His father was a member of the Canadian Parliament , and was governmental-minded . He persuaded his son to study in Scotland to fit himself for a diplomatic career . On a vacation on the Continent John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He collected a wagonload , mostly old pewter , using the proceeds of a small inheritance , and brought them to New York . That ended diplomacy . He set up an antique shop , and quickly failed . Broke , he took a job as chorus man , always having been able to dance . This led to his going into a cabaret act with Genevieve Lyon , a Chicago minister 's daughter . They danced at Bustanoby 's , and at Shanley 's  --  where now stands the Paramount Theatre , scene of the skits ( Publix ) , the arrangement of which has since provided Anderson with his most gainful occupation . In the cabaret days society matrons came to him for dancing lessons and advice on getting up parties . The late Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish engaged him to arrange some of hers , notably that for the Duke of Manchester . Anderson was now getting his hand in at things he liked , but his wife's. illness  --  he married Miss Lyon ? forced her to go west and he went along . For months he travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to New York . The war came along and he served in the American army , doing accounting . After the war he began to put on skits at the Palais Royal , for which he wrote the lyrics and James K. Hackett the music . A year later the two men presented the first " Greenwich Village Follies , " which made Anderson . His genius for arranging lights , colors , dances , and costumes was allowed full swing and he began to create a number of memorable effects , particularly with lighting , such as the scene in one of the " Follies " where , by merely shifting the lights , an exterior was changed to an interior . Together with Robert Milton he started several yers ago a school of dancing and dramatic are which , however , quietly dissolved recently despite the imposing list of names on the board of directors . At work on a show , Anderson is temperamental . In rehearsals he gives all the cast nicknames , the better to shout orders at them . He never relies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrusts his sense of comedy . Some comedians annoy him , especially those that dress unkemptly . He was the first to use Benda masks in shows . Along Broadway he is known most widely as an expansive breakfast host in his lower Park Avenue apartment , which is crammed with bric-a-brac , colonial furniture , and one of the finest collections of pewter in the country . He adds continuously and recklessly to an immense and colorful wardrobe . Splendide FROM Philadelphia they report a pretty problem . After delicate and exhaustive researches into the stocking needs of American women , during which thousands were measured , it was found that the stocking needs could be divided into four great classes . So far as size is concerned , that is . The Brown Durrell Company , one of the oldest stocking concerns maa.ta- there is , did the investigating and finding , and made the decision to group their output into four classes , according to proportions . Then they had to name the classes . There lay the difficulty . The first , or trimmest class , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Princess ? noncommittal enough  --  and the size above that Regal , also considered safe . That left the  --  ah  --  largest-size limb . Well , they thought about it a lot ; you ask for Splendide . Amenity WHEN a fireman 's hat blows off during a run to a fire , what they do is stop the . fire-engine . This happened in Fifth Avenue last week . One of the firemen hanging on the hack of a plunging engine lost his helmet in the wind . All the firemen yelled at the driver . He stopped . When the hat was recovered , the engine was off again , screaming and roaring . Not a rule , just an old tradition of the department . ed on glass and resting on tables at handy points on all decks . A tiny light grows , marking the spot where one is standing when looking at the map .

This device takes the edge off the most ingenious conception of the Ile de France , namely , the small niche at the head of each bed to hold one 's watch and keep it from slithering around . As everyone knows by this time , the Bremen is spacious , East , has an airplane that can be shut off the top deck , and is modernistic , but not pugnaciously so . Nothing flies up and hits you in the face , unless it is the slippery corridor . On no other ship do so much soaping and holystoning go on when in port . True , the writing-room and the library may be a bit obtrusive because of mottoes and sayings inscribed on them in a loud-voiced sort of way . The library has twenty panels , each containing an inscription in a different language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up only English . They contain , among other things , a wisecrack by Mark Twain , a maxim of Aaron Burr , and Ella Wheeler Wilcox 's " Laugh and the world laughs TDer Champion HE excitement has died down and the Bremen can now slip into port with net much more fuss than an ordinary ship . The day we visited it few visitors were aboard . This gave those who were a better chance to look around and tak a removable things for souvenirs before they were all picked over . One woman whom we saw quite a bit of took a handsome , if inexpensive , nickel key such as is used to lock a porthole cover or a second-class cabin door . We learned that signs in German arc pretty hard to get now , owing to vigilance on the part of the crew .

The real lifeboats of the ship , by the way , are swung high up out of one 's uneasy line of vision , work electrically , and are described by guides as infallible . ? IN many places in Connecticut they have trouble keeping servants because of the distance from the movies , etc. , especially colored servants . One matron of a household thought to win the loyalty of her latest maid by making her presents . She gave her a Victrola for her room and new records , books , and , recently , a gray dress . This , however , was rejected by Hydrangea . " I cai n't wear gray , " she said . " Makes me look sallow . " Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? brought further facts about smoking from a gentleman in the industry who attends directors ' meetings . He says cigar smoking has fallen off dreadfully in the past few years  --  and everyone knows it  --  but that few people are aware to what an extent the pipe is also the victim of the cigarette . Pipe sales , he informs us , dropped twentyfivc per cent in the last fiscal year and pipe tobacco suffered more than for any time in twenty years . This is considered alarming and was unlooked-for , despite the heavy cigarette advertising . ment feverishly devising a way of putting the pipe in better repute . Shortly one company will begin running ads portraying young men of elegance in evening dress smoking pipes . One thing , the old Jimmy-pipe type of poster seems to have gone out and no longer will men be shown with their feet up , smoking , sometimes in their shirtsleeves . Point of Art SOME Americans were standing in front of the Chartres Cathedral when a fellow countrywoman , sightseeing alone , came and stood near them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one might have thought she was drinking in the cathedral 's beauty . Suddenly she turned to one of the group . " What , " she asked with enthusiasm , " do you suppose that church weighs ? " Spare That Name TT became necessary , an engineer in- 11. forms us , to invent a contrivance to prevent people listening in on transatlantic telephone calls ; so one was invented . It is known as a " sound-scrambler " and it operates to distort conversations into horrible sounds , meaningless to all but the persons at each end of the connection . We got only a general idea of the thing , but enough to understand an incident which attended its first demonstration , before the Engineers ' Club , or some such body . The man who was explaining it would shout a word or phrase into the machine and only a tangle of sound would come out . The word " telephone " turned to " woggle-blink . " The demonstrator asked his listeners to suggest some words to be scrambled . One of them called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the demonstrator . After thinking for some moments he said , " In view of the high esteem and great respect in which Colonel Lindbergh is held , in view of what he has done , I do not think ...

Waggeries of tile Day TT was Mr. Charles MacArthur who .1 said , of one of the scions of one of the best North Shore families , that he was studying to be a moron . We could n't learn who remarked , with a sigh , " I 'm captain of my soul now , but I had more fun when I was cabin boy . " It was a wag in the Kelly-pool game at the Players ' Club who confided that he knew a tight-rope walker who had started on a shoestring . It was Bugs Baer who met on the street a fellow journalist , a lady who has made a big success going here and there and reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers . " Is it true , " he asked , " that you have just signed a five-year contract at double your old salary ? " She admitted gleefully that it was . " My , my , " said Mr. Baer , " I should think they would insure you for a million dollars against deafness . " New Chinatown WE learn from a real-estate man who does business in Chinatown that the neighborhood is changing in many ways . For one thing , it is expanding . But for Italian opposition it would now brim out along Mulberry Street opposite Columbus Park . One grim Italian widow is the principal opposition to the advance now . She is holding out for a stiff price for a tenement she owns . The Orientals have already offered twenty thousand over the assessed valuation . They usually , in acquiring a building , pay above the normal market price and then spend more in buying up and compromising leases . NVhen they move in they multiply the number of tenants , but American influence is being felt , and they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , although Chinatown is greater in area now than ever , its population is smaller . Too , there are signs of a more complete community life . The Chinese Charitable &; Benevolent Association , which is supported not only by local Chinese but by the Nanking government , is starring a school this fall , by taking over and restoring an old public school in Mutt Street . Ten graduates of American colleges will instruct the children of Chinatown in reading and writing their parents ' native language and in the history and literature of China . It is the first school of its kind ever attempted here . Also , a Chinese mortician has set up in business , challenging two Occidentals who have always handled all of Chinatown 's funerals , and two women , the sisters Wong , have set up a beauty parlor , the first down there . They are doing considerable business . Miss Alice Wong is a graduate of a New York high school and has attained delightful mastery in the use of the American word " yeah .

Battles Long Ago AN aged but still blustery old colo- nel , who lives in Richmond , has been visiting his niece here , and talking about war . While he talks about the Civil War mostly , he also engages to straighten out problems connected with the World War . Occasionally he confuses the two . Recently , at dinner , when someone mentioned sunburn , he managed to turn even that subject to warfare . This is easy for him . " Our government , " said the old warrior , " used artificial tan during the late war to deceive the enemy . Troops were painted with the stuff to make the Germans believe they were facing southerners , sub , bronzed by the vigorous life of the South and imbued with the spirit at which all the world wondered in 1863 .
