In an office in the Old Arcade Bldg. , Cleveland , reporters listened to the low , kindly voice of a long-beloved citizen-Charles Francis Brush , 79 , six feet tall , big of frame , bushy of eyebrows , world-famed physicist , inventor of the arc light . He answered questions concerning the $500,000 foundation he had just endowed . <P> As a boy on a farm he had tinkered with wires and electrical apparatus . At 27 , he had designed the first open coil dynamo , following this with an arc lamp , the " ring clutch , " in which the carbon is clutched by a ring attached to an armature which automatically keeps the light steady . This not only solved a long standing difficulty but brought the price to street level . Three years later ( 1879 ) the Public Square in Cleveland glowed under the first public arc lights . . . . <P> He was not a man to talk of his brilliant past ; he wanted the reporters to get the right angle on physiology and the cloudy future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The half million dollars was put in trust in memory of his scientist-son , Charles Francis Brush Jr. , who died last year . Its income is " to finance efforts contributing toward the betterment of the human stock and toward the regulation of the increase of population , to the end that children shall be begotten only under conditions which make possible a heritage of mental and physical health , and a favorable environment . " * <P> Scientist Brush , concerned about the future , knows that science plays no favorites , preserves some of the weak , unfit , feeble-minded as well as the strong . " General reading and common sense , " he says , have made him want to educate people to the evils of too great population increase . His trust fund will be used for research in eugenics , popular enlightenment , regulation of overpopulation . The program of the foundation has not yet taken definite form . Birth control clinics may be the first step . <P> The phrases " birth control " and " human stock " fell harshly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cleveland . He promptly seized an occasion to set forth the traditional view of his Church . Said he , to a graduating class of nurses at the Charity Hospital training school : " In older times we referred to humans as the human race , but according to this foundation we are being classed with the animals on the farm , the cow , the horse , the mule-perhaps with the alligator and the snake . . . . According to this foundation , I have no right to be born , for I am the youngest of 16 children and God bless my mother for every one of them ! . . . Thank heaven that I was born ! And if I do say it myself , I have not done so badly in my lifetime . " <P> What the Cleveland bishop said , every Catholic prelate has in some manner paraphrased . Memorable was a 1925 speech of Patrick Cardinal Hayes , Archbishop of New York : " . . . By such sin fell empires , states and nations . Religion shudders at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Birth control is heralded because the poor . . . are largely responsible for defectives . Never was there cast . . . a more offensive insult . Defectives , physical or mental , have immortal souls , redeemed by the blood of Christ . The forces of evil . . . would exploit the bodies and ruin the souls of the children of God .
