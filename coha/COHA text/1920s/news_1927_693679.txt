txt The sashweight used alternately by Henry Judd Gray and Mrs. Ruth Brown Snyder in the murder of Albert Snyder at Queens Village last Sunday morning , according ' to Gray 's confession , was purchased at Kingston , N. Y .. on March 4 . Detective Krudell returned yesterday from Kingston , where he interviewed the hardware dealer from whom Gray bought the weight . The dealer remembered the transaction and identified Gray from his photograph . Gray delivered the sashweight to Mrs. Snyder on the following day , according to Detective Frank W. Heyner of the Jamaica Precinct . That was March 5 , fifteen days before the murder actually took place . The original intention is said to have been to cornmit the crime on March 6 , but it is said to have been postponed because Gray lost his nerve . Another touch of the ghastly burlesque which has marked the case from the beginning was revealed yesterday . This was the fact that Gray had tied up in the same package the s-.shweight intended for the murder of Snyder and an old-fashioned three-cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Snyder . The bottle was intended to be made over into an imitation antique lamp by Mrs. Snyder , who was enthusiastic about novelties of this type for the decoration of her home . Gave Package to Mrs. Snyder . Gray bought the sashweight at Kingston , according to his confession , because he thought the police would never be able to trace the purchase of so common an object at such an outof-the-way place . Coming down to New York , he met Mrs. Snyder by appointment on March 5 and they had lunch together at Henry 's . It was here that he gave her the double bundle containing the weapon and the knick-knack for the living room mantelpiece . Gray also bought the chloroform at a drug store in Kingston , N. Y. He I described this purchase in his confession . This was another of the scores of details in which his confession has proved to be entirely accurate . The money incentive for the murder was $101.000 , instead of *52,000 , it was learned yesterday . The insurance policies of Albert Snyder totaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision doubled the amount if death was violent . Lieutenant Michael , who brought Gray to this city from Syracuse last Monday , said yesterday that the discovery of poison in the whisky carried by Gray on that occasion made it clear now that he wanted to commit suicide on the train on the way to New York . Gray , according to Lieutenant . , began to cough violently and affected a great hoarseness . Finally . he said : " Boys , my throat is hurting me . May I take some of my cough medicine ? " Took Bottle from Gray . Nobody interfered while Gray fumbled at his suitcase with his handcuffed hand . He opened it , rummaged about inside and drew forth a pint flask . He was about to draw the cork with his teeth when one of the detectives reached over and took it from the prisoner . Gray coughed and looked appealingly at the detective . The latter shook his head several times , drove the cork in tight and put the bottle hack in the suitcase . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city toxicologist , found to contain a large quantity of bichloride of mercury . Dr. Gettler yesterday made a preliminary report to Dr. Charles Norris , Chief Medical Examiner for the city , who said : " He found twenty grains of bichloride of mercury in what would be about half a drink of whisky . That quantity is sufficient to kill . I never knew before that so large a quantity of bichloride of mercury could be dissolved . " The examination so far shows no poison in the tissues , other . than the alcohol and chloroform already mentioned , but the investigation for poisons has not been completed . Death resulted from asphyxiation . It is hard to say whether the wire used or the chloroform was the chief factor in the strangulation , and the blows over the head probably contributed . " The amount of alcohol found in the brain tissues was very large . The amount of alcohol is technically described as 3-plus . The limit of satura- tion is 4 . An alcohol-4 means that a ' man is dead drunk . Three-plus means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a man in such a state of intoxication could have made any kind of a fight for his life . " It is impossible to say how much whisky the man had drunk . It depends on individual capacity . A hardened drinker might possibly drink a quart of whisky , if he did not drink it too rapidly , without reaching the 3-plus stage . A tablespoonful or a little more might induce such a condition in a child . I would imagine that the man must have had quite a few drinks . This test , however , does not really show how much liquor he had , but how well he oxidized it . The system of a man accustomed to liquor is organized to oxidize it very rapidly . and the non-drink oxidizes it slowly . " Denies Change of Venue Plan . James T. Hallinan of Hallinan &; Groh , trial attorneys for Gray , said yesterday that he did not desire a change of venue and knew of no plan to ask for one . Samuel L. Miller , chief counsel for Gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought . Edgar F. Hazelton , lawyer for Mrs. Snyder , said yesterday that he would oppose any motion for a change of venue . " We want Mrs. Snyder to be tried right here in Queens by her neighbors . " Mr. Hazelton said he and his associate , Dana Wallace , had won their last eleven murder cases . " And we have no trepidation about thin one , " he said . " Mrs. Snyder will be acquitted on the merits of the defense we will establish . The public does not know the half of the facts of this case and will be surprised when they are known . " Mr. Hazelton said Mrs. Snyder was nervous and depressed because yesterday was her birthday and she had had a big party planned . Sixteen people had been invited , including the persons who attended the bridge party at the home of William C. Pidgeon In Hollis on the night of the murder . Two cakes were to have been baked , one for Mrs. Snyder and the other for Lorraine , her 9-year-old daughter . Gray had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confer with him . It was because of this slowness on the part of his attorneys to begin the preparation of Gray 's defense that credence was given to a report that the trial would not start on April 11 as scheduled , but that it would be put off a week . This report was also supported by the fact that Frank F. Adel , the regular County Judge , who is convalescing from an operation for appendicitis , will be fully recovered by April 18 . Although no attempt has been made to transfer the case from the Supreme Court to the County Court , there is little likelihood that it will remain in the higher court , especially if Judge Adel resumes the bench in time to preside . Mr. Newcombe said that there was no truth to the rumor that he had asked to have Justice Cropsey preside , adding that the appointment of judges was solely in the hands of the Appellate Division in Albany . The prosecutor announced that he had received a letter from an attorney , Waldemar F. Timme of 359 Madison Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dead man , Warren Schneider , to look after the interests of Lorraine in the disposition of the estate of Snyder.
